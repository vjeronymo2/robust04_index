			<p>920421 FT  21 APR 92 / The Queen's Awards 1992 (4): All the world's a test paper - University of Cambridge Local Examinations Syndicate PERHAPS THE fact that the University of Cambridge is a name recognised all over the world has contributed to the success of its Local Examinations Syndicate in translating local into global presence. The syndicate was established in Cambridge in 1858, and now conducts educational assessments on every continent and in almost every country. Business has expanded threefold since 1985, and more than 60 per cent of turnover comes from outside the UK, an achievement that has won the organisation an export award. Dr Tyrell Smith, deputy secretary of the syndicate, hopes the award will help to correct the image many people have of the UCLES. 'People in the UK just think of us as an O-level and A-level board. But we do have a very big export side to our work,' he says. The syndicate went international as far back as 1863, when it examined candidates in Trinidad. Now its business is divided into three, roughly equal, sectors: UK work, overseas schools examinations and English as a foreign language (EFL) testing. Last year 1m candidates sat Cambridge exams and 8m question papers were completed. The syndicate is run as a department of the university, and its board of governors is composed of Cambridge dons. It employs 450 people in Cambridge, as well as thousands of part-time examiners and full-time representatives in several countries. In the field of EFL, the main competition is with American English and examining bodies such as Princeton's Education Testing Service, but Dr Smith says many schools prefer Cambridge tests for their more rigorous methods. 'One distinct reason why people tend to choose us as opposed to ETS tests is that we have a more holistic approach. We are interested in the way people write the language and speak it. Our requirement to write continuous prose has been an important difference,' he says. American tests rely heavily on multiple choice testing. Interest in learning the English language tends to coincide with countries opening up and becoming more internationally minded. Demand for EFL has surged in eastern Europe in the past couple of years. The syndicate's business in Greece has boomed since it joined the EC, and it is now developing markets in south-east Asia. One growth area which has surprised even the examination syndicate has been the success of the International General Certificate of School Education, introduced in 1988 and equivalent to the GCSE, which has replaced O-levels in Britain. Entries for the IGCSE rose to 38,000 in 1992, up 50 per cent on last year. The UCLES says the IGCSE is 'not simply an expatriate version' of the GCSE, but is based on an international curriculum, 'free from Anglocentric or even Eurocentric bias'. This is borne out by its popularity in such diverse places as Egypt and Latin America. In 1995 Cambridge's IGCSE will replace the South African system currently used as a national secondary school leaving exam in Namibia. The 'localisation' process, whereby Cambridge exams are adopted nationally, is an important part of the syndicate's work. 'With Commonwealth countries becoming independent, they have tended to want to develop their own examinations,' says Dr Smith. In Zimbabwe the syndicate has worked closely with the education ministry to set up an O-level exam system which meets local requirements. The exams are now taken by 200,000 students a year, and are marked by 4,000 local examiners, trained by UCLES. Other countries, including Singapore and Namibia, prefer to stick to Cambridge's IGCSE, making it easy for students to work or study anywhere in the world. The syndicate also trains and examines EFL teachers. Many teachers of English abroad are fresh graduates with no specialist teaching qualifications, but the need for at least basic training in EFL is increasingly being recognised. The syndicate runs EFL teaching courses of varying lengths tailored to different needs. Last year 7,000 candidates were tested at 300 centres worldwide. So successful has UCLES been that, in some parts of the world, when you mention the name of Cambridge, people now think first of the examination syndicate, and only after that of the university.</p>

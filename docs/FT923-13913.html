			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / Western warships to tighten Serbian sanctions THE Western European Union defence organisation is today expected to agree to send naval units to patrol the Adriatic to tighten sanctions against Serbia after the Yugoslav republic's failure to stop the war in Bosnia-Hercegovina. In separate moves, the US dispatched the cruiser Biddle and an amphibious landing ship to the area, and France decided to send more troops and helicopters to Bosnia to back United Nations relief operations. The two ships from the Sixth Fleet last night entered the Adriatic, where seven US warships were briefly stationed last week. The Defence Department said the ships would provide communications and radar help for US humanitarian aid flights to Sarajevo. The moves come amid warnings by UN officials in Sarajevo, the besieged Bosnian capital, that continued fighting is endangering the international airlift. Swedish truck drivers hired by the UN refugee relief agency are refusing to transport aid because of sniper fire. Officials of the nine-member WEU, attending a summit in Helsinki of the 51-nation Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, insisted that its action, to be agreed by foreign ministers in the margin of the CSCE meeting, was not a precursor to full-scale military intervention in Bosnia. Such a step was currently not envisaged by any western country. Mr Enzo Scotti, the Italian president of the WEU council, said the ministers would also discuss ways of protecting the humanitarian airlift to Sarajevo. It was not immediately known how many ships might be sent to the area, but Mr John Major, UK prime minister, announced earlier in the week that Britain would be sending a destroyer, HMS Nottingham, 'to help enforce sanctions'. In a speech at the Helsinki summit, President George Bush strongly supported action to ensure that UN sanctions were respected and that relief supplies got through to Sarajevo, 'no matter what it takes'. But at a meeting yesterday morning with Mr Alija Izetbegovic, the Bosnian president, Mr Bush made no commitment to supply weapons to Bosnia's defence forces or to intervene militarily in the crisis. US officials have made it plain over the past few days that, while Washington would contemplate sending military aircraft to ensure the safety of the UN humanitarian airlift and overland convoys if necessary, it has ruled out dispatching ground forces to Bosnia. The UK has adopted a similar position on sending troops. In France, Mr Jean Musitelli, the presidential spokesman, said his country's move had been closely co-ordinated with Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general, who had asked France to contribute 700 troops to the UN contingents replacing the Canadian battalion in Bosnia. Last night negotiators at the CSCE failed to break a deadlock over a statement condemning the rump state of Yugoslavia, comprising Serbia and Montenegro, and left the issue for the leaders of the member countries to decide. The Bosnian president has appealed to all 51 CSCE leaders - the former Yugoslav delegation has been temporarily suspended - to sign a declaration of solidarity with Bosnia today. At the UN last night, Lord Carrington, after briefing the Security Council, said he would call for another round of the EC-sponsored peace talks on Bosnia. US urged to send troops, Page 2</p>

			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / Survey of Asia-Pacific Telecommunications (1): Lined up for development - In a region where telecommunications services range from the primitive to the sophisticated, opportunities for newcomers are legion. Andrew Adonis discusses the problems and highlights the areas where new operators and investors can make a contribution Metternich's famous quip that Italy was a geographical expression applies more justly to the Asia-Pacific region. Societies as diverse as New Zealand, the Philippines and China have barely one thing in common: a situation on the same side of the globe. Telecommunications may be helping, gently, to integrate the region, but its diversity is reflected in the existing state of the industry. As the graphs make clear, all stages of telecommunications development are to be found in the region. Japan, Australia, New Zealand and Hong Kong have a 'teledensity' - a ratio of main lines to population - on a par with the rest of the developed world. Singapore is not far behind, and South Korea has a teledensity just behind that of Spain. By contrast, most of the region's emerging market countries have primitive networks, with fewer than 10 lines per 100 people. A swathe of low-income countries have no national networks worth the name, and provide telephones for fewer than one in 100 of their citizens. Therefore when American or European investors or operators talk glibly of 'moving into Asia-Pacific telecoms', all it tells you of their strategy is that they want to do something abroad. The opportunities to do something are legion. In the region's high-income countries, liberalisation and privatisation have caught on more strongly than in the European Union. Australia, New Zealand and Japan all have competing cellular and fixed-wire operators. Hong Kong's domestic monopoly will be broken next year: the British colony already has four cellular operators, three of them with two networks apiece, plus some 15 paging operators. New Zealand has sold 49 per cent of its state telecoms operator to Ameritech and Bell Atlantic, the US regional Bell companies, and now has arguably the world's most open telecoms market. In medium- and low-income countries, the role telecoms modernisation can play in underpinning economic growth is widely appreciated. Almost everywhere, there is a new readiness to look beyond the traditional monopoly operators, even if that means legal reforms and domestic controversy. As a recent World Bank discussion paper* puts it: 'It is generally agreed that the limited attention accorded telecommunications in the past and the prevalence of state-run monopolies has cost Asia's poorer countries dearly, economically and socially'. More than 2.8bn people in the region's low-income countries have access to barely 25m telephone lines. The priority, argues the World Bank paper, is not so much privatisation but the licensing of new operators and the creation of an investment and regulatory environment which is congenial to them. 'By and large,' it advises, 'governments should adopt a 'serve it or lose it' policy to require carriers to meet the paid demand for new service within a given time or face the prospect of (a) having a competing company licensed to provide service, or (b) having portions of their service territory refranchised to other carriers.' On that basis, barriers to competition would tumble across the region. Waiting lists and investment patterns are such that in at least half of the poorer countries it would take until past 2000 to satisfy existing demand for new telephone lines if expansion continues on recent trends. And waiting lists expose only a fraction of suppressed demand and growth potential. China is the world's most breathtaking telecommunications opportunity. Its government has a target of providing at least 40m new lines by 2000, offering manufacturers and operators the prospect of installing from scratch a network equal to that of two British Telecommunications. Western equipment manufacturers already do brisk business in China. Alcatel, the French manufacturer, is the leader, with about 30 per cent of the market and significant production facilities. Germany's Siemens and Japan's NEC have notable stakes; America's AT&amp;T is eyeing opportunities seriously. The coming months will be critical for the evolution of liberalisation in the low- and medium-income countries. Fierce debate is taking place within different tiers of China's government about allowing overseas operators to build and operate networks. Mr Huang Ju, Shanghai's reformist mayor, said last year that he wanted to license western operators to expand Shanghai's telecommunications. The idea received a frosty response from Beijing's hidebound ministry of posts and telecommunications, which is also battling with other ministries anxious to see alternative providers. But most analysts see liberalisation as inevitable if the government is serious about meeting its targets. Crucial decisions are also soon to be taken in India and Indonesia. The Indian government is selling a stake in VSNL, India's international operator, to international institutions. Once complete, about a third of the company will be in non-government hands. The country's forward-looking telecoms commission has proposed that the domestic sector should be liberalised further: one option is for domestic telecoms operations to be split into four separate companies and privatised, with other operators licensed to build lines and provide services. The Indian government has received more than 30 proposals from non-state operators to provide services, worth between Dollars 10bn and Dollars 15bn between them. US West, Singapore Telecom and Telecom New Zealand are among the overseas companies in the frame. US West is proposing a Dollars 100m joint venture to provide services to an industrial town in Tamil Nadu in partnership with state-owned Tamil Nadu Electronic Development Corporation. In Indonesia, which has barely 0.7 lines per 100 people, partial privatisation of the state operator is under serious consideration, along with liberalisation to allow private sector involvement in some form. The models for many are Thailand, which has pioneered 'build, operate, transfer' contracts, and Malaysia, which four years ago sold a 25 per cent stake in its state operator on the Kuala Lumpur stock exchange and is now considering pressing ahead with competition in all markets. 'There is over Dollars 2bn of international public offerings (IPOs) already in the pipeline in the region, excluding Japan,' says Mr Andrew Harrington, Asia-Pacific telecoms analyst with Salomon Brothers in Hong Kong. 'There were two listed companies outside Japan in 1990. Now there are 30; by the end of this year there will be 40; and by the end of 1996 there will be at least 50. In the three years to the end of 1996, IPOs worth at least Dollars 15bn are likely to be forthcoming. It's a huge potential market.' It is also a prime test bed for new technology, and applications tailored to developing markets with low line penetration. If it secures its Indian licence, US West intends to use cellular networks as a means of providing a local service rapidly to middle-class districts where demand is highest, rolling out a service in advance of the fixed-wire network. Paging and telepoint services have taken off in the region: in Hong Kong, pagers are as much fashion accessories as a means of communication. Several operators are exploring the possibility of using radio-based networks for fixed-phones, to accelerate roll-out and avoid laying expensive fibre and cable in the local loop and rural areas. Extensive installation of payphones is also an attractive business option, a market well served by manufacturers including the UK's GPT. However, for any liberalisation to be successful, effective regulation is essential. Issues of inter-connection, standards, pricing and even bribery, bedevil all attempts at telecoms liberalisation in developing countries. Divesting the state operator of responsibility for detailed rule-making is not a sufficient reform, but it is absolutely necessary if better service is the object. As the World Bank stresses, 'regulation has been the weakest part of sector reform in poorer countries. If this deficiency is not addressed, ambitious plans for sectoral expansion are likely to be compromised'. * Telecommunications Sector Reform in Asia: Towards a New Pragmatism.

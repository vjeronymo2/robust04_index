			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Marek Dreving: "Rural Central Faction Threatens </F> To Leave Government Coalition"]    [Text]    Estonia's Rural Central Faction (EMKE: Eesti Maa  Keskerakond) will have to decide--whether to stay in the  government coalition or join the opposition--within the time  period between the congress of rural people, and the meeting of  the faction's general council scheduled for May 28, said Ivar  Raig, EMKE chairman and member of Riigikogu [Estonia's  parliament], at a press conference that followed the session of  the faction's central council yesterday.    "Once again, we are getting signals that the interests of  the  rural people are being ignored. The latest example of that is  the fact that the finance ministry has not allocated any money  to the agricultural ministry for paying social stipends to  students at agricultural-technical schools," Ivar Raag said.    "If the government does not, in the near future, pass  measures aimed at protecting rural residents and guaranteeing  them a stable life, EMKE will join the opposition," Ivar Raig  said.    Ivar Raig also said that agriculture minister Jaan Leetsar  is  ready to resign, in case the faction joins the opposition. At  the same time it would be difficult for the faction to recall  reform minister Liia Hanni who has made a great  contribution  to speeding up reform, according to Raig. He also said that the  faction is trying to find a political reason for recalling the  agricultural minister only.    EMKE also discussed, once again, the possibility of forming  its own faction in Riigikogu. During the year-end government  crisis EMKE announced that it will not join the opposition for  three months. "Soon, there will be no other alternative for  expressing our political identity than forming our own faction,  like the liberals did," Raig said.    He said though that there was no hurry for forming a  faction,  because EMKE will be short one delegate, and that forming a  faction could not take place until April or May.    Raig noted that the rural population is the biggest loser in  reform politics, and that new ground is being gained for solving  the differences in the political views of rural factions, which  fosters hope for a bigger representation for the rural  population in the new Riigikogu. The central council of the  faction authorized the board to intensify negotiations with the  Farmers' Council, the Rural League and the League of Lawful  Owners regarding the formation of a possible election alliance.    EMKE is also seeking substantive reform of the government,  and wants the Ministry of Agriculture to be changed into the  Ministry of Rural Economy, which would include specialists  dealing with the production of Land, Forest and Fishing Offices,  now reporting to the Ministry of Environment.    Reform minister Liia Hanni said that the government  has  agreed to the EMKE proposal for carrying out a substantive  reform of government and its structures, but this has been held  up by the law for organizing the government. "Right now,  unnecessary tensions and discussions are being generated that  can put the government to a test, internally," Hanni said.  She added that it is necessary to work out a more specific  structure for ministries and district governments.    Hanni mentioned that since the government coalition  had  found no common positions on protecting the domestic market and  on the income policies of agriculture, even at the time the  coalition agreement was reached, EMKE has found itself at odds  with the rest of the government coalition. She thinks, however,  that any juxtaposition of rural residents against their urban  counterparts should be avoided.    About her possible resignation, Hanni said that  whenever  the issue of EMKE's joining the opposition comes up, she will  make up her mind. So far, she has not had to face that issue.</p>

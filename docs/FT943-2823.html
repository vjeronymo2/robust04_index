			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / Markets fall on fresh US inflation fears Further signs of inflationary pressures in the US triggered fresh falls in the world's bond and stock markets yesterday. US industrial capacity utilisation rose to its highest level for more than five years at 84.7 per cent in August, threatening production bottlenecks and higher prices. The new figure renewed fears of further interest rate rises in the US and other markets. The US long bond slid 1 1/2 points, dragging European bond prices down sharply. On stock markets, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 20.53 points down when New York closed. The UK's FT-SE 100 and Germany's Dax both fell 1.5 per cent. 'It was a collapse waiting to happen,' said Mr Michael Burke, international bond analyst at Citibank in London. European bond prices, which have found it difficult to 'de-couple' from the US market following the reversal of the US interest rate cycle in February, had been under pressure all week, traders said. Inflation worries also undermined the dollar, which closed in London at DM1.5376. It closed at DM1.5445 in New York after trading above DM1.55 earlier in the day. Sterling was a beneficiary of the US currency's weakness, touching a 16-month high of Dollars 1.587 before slipping to close at Dollars 1.579 in New York. The UK gilts market, still digesting Monday's  1/2 point rise in bank base rates, was hit by news that the August public sector borrowing requirement reached Pounds 3.2bn, substantially higher than market expectations, reviving worries about potential funding difficulties. Meanwhile, interest rate concerns and weak bond markets were seen capping any potential recovery in share prices. The Federal Reserve said that US industrial production rose by 0.7 per cent in August, and announced upwards revisions to production in the three preceding months. Capacity utilisation is believed to be one of the main indicators looked at by Fed governors when assessing monetary policy, and August's higher rate led some economists to argue for an earlier interest rate move. 'We expect the Fed to tighten short-term rates another 25 basis points in mid-October,' said Mr Joseph Liro, an economist with investment bankers SG Warburg in the US.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bratislava, March 14 (CTK) -- Slovak President  Michal Kovac today dismissed Vladimir Meciar in writing from the  posts of premier, chairman of the Defense Council and director  of the Privatization Ministry, after a vote of no-confidence in  Meciar was passed by parliament on March 11.    The outgoing prime minister announced this himself, saying  that as of 11:00 today his government was ending its activity,  resigning and together with the Movement for a Democratic  Slovakia (HZDS, of which Meciar is chairman) was moving into  opposition as a "shadow cabinet."    At the same time, Meciar declined Kovac's formal offer that  the HZDS, as the strongest political movement in parliament,  establish a new cabinet.    "The last meeting has taken place of a government which  emerged from democratic elections as the will of the people and  which today has ended its activity," Meciar said after midday at  a press conference.    He said that none of the government members accepted Kovac's  proposal that they temporarily manage their ministry, adding  that this was not a political gesture, but a question of the  Constitution, since temporary management of ministries would  only be possible if the government had formally handed in its  resignation.    Defense Minister Imrich Andrejcak had formally become an  HZDS  member on March 12 "in protest," Meciar said. (Andrejcak used  to be an independent deputy.)    Meciar said all state secretaries and leaders of offices  would be dismissed by March 18. "There will be one week for the  other parties to propose new candidates to the president," he  said.    "This was a government of the founders of the state... if we  did not have time to finish everything that we had planned to do  in four years, that does not matter. We will ask the citizens  if they want us again," the ex-prime minister for a second time  announced. Meciar was ousted for the first time three years ago.    "In the interest of the state, we shall try to return  again,"  added Meciar, counting on victory for the HZDS either in early  election or in regular elections, which are to be held in 1996.    Meciar also expressed doubt in the opposition's willingness  to hold early elections and its ability to create a majority  government. "The result (of the recent events) is a change of  people, and not support for a new government. It will be a  minority one again, and even more than before.  Congratulations," he added.    Clarifying this, he said that in the 150-member parliament  56  HZDS deputies and nine deputies of its coalition partner, the  Slovak National Party (SNS) would go into opposition.  Furthermore, he said, "nobody wanted" the 14 Hungarian deputies  in a government coalition. All that had united the opposition  before was resistance to him, and a conflict of interests now  threatened, Meciar believed.    Meciar is also counting on a split in the opposition  parties,  above all in the strongest of them, the Democratic Left Party  (SDL). He accused SDL leaders Peter Weiss and Milan Ftacnik of  not respecting the agreements which had been concluded with the  HZDS, keeping information from their own deputies and betraying  the contents of confidential talks. He said that last year the  SDL had received five offers to enter the government, and that  before the vote of no-confidence the government posts had  already been shared out: 11 for the HZDS, six for the SDL and  one for the SNS.    Meciar ruled out the possibility of the HZDS giving  parliamentary support to a constitutional bill allowing early  elections to be held in autumn, saying that he was prepared to  press for a referendum on the "immediate" holding of early  elections, on the loss of mandates for deputies who had left  their parties during the electoral term, and on the evidencing  of money during the privatization process. "Immediate" elections  meant a date of June 24 and 25, he said. Only if a referendum  was unsuccessful would he be prepared to negotiate with parties,  he said.    A condition for holding elections would have to be a change  in the electoral system, which would prevent deputies "pouring"  from one party to another. "Our conditions are as follows: To  respect the will of 15 percent of citizens (who signed the  petition for a referendum), to change the electoral law, to hold  a referendum and then elections," he said.    "The point of a referendum is to change the constitutional  conditions... a referendum can step outside the constitutional  framework, because it is the most democratic," Meciar said in  reply to doubts concerning the acceptability of questions  concerning deputies' mandates.    Meciar said he saw a way out of the present political  instability as lying in "anchoring" the results of the next  election in parliament, perhaps introducing a presidential  system, or in a move to a winner-take-all electoral system  (instead of a proportional representation one) so that people  had the opportunity of dismissing their deputies.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Tamara Zamyatina, Yuriy Sizov, </F> and Nikolay Sorokin]    [Text] Naberezhnyye Chelny (Republic of Tatarstan), 30 May  -- Boris Yeltsin does not renounce the formula "take as much  sovereignty as you can stand," which he uttered in 1991 with  regard to the republics and regions that were part of Russia.  The president of the Russian Federation stated on the steps of  the aircraft on arrival in Naberezhnyye Chelny: "I was beaten,  severely criticized for this phrase, but I endured it all and  was right."    To confirm his words, Boris Yeltsin gave the example of  Tatarstan, the bilateral treaty which showed that "the republic  has taken on as much responsibilities as it can cope with. As  for what is beyond its capabilities, it has delegated that to  the federal authorities."    According to the Russian president, the main thing for  Russia  at present is to implement the treaty. In the view of Emil  Pain, a Russian president expert, both sides, Russia and  Tatarstan, have so far been violating the agreement: the  republic is sending four-five times less tax revenue to the  federal budget than had been laid down in the agreement. In  turn, Russia is not ensuring that a mechanism for the  implementation of the treaty is being drawn up.    Tatarstan's President Mintimer Shaymiyev, when greeting  Boris  Yeltsin at Naberezhnyye Chelny airport, reaffirmed his adherence  to the phrase "strong republics -- strong center." He said that  the aim of the present meeting was "strengthening trust, finding  a joint solution to economic problems, and discussing federal  programs."    Boris Yeltsin intends to begin his look at the course of  reform in Tatarstan at the Kama automobile works, beginning with  the production plant that was hit by fire, to decide what help  can be given to the automobile manufacturers. In the view of  Sergey Shakhray, which he expressed to an ITAR-TASS  correspondent on the eve of the visit to Tatarstan, the matter  does not concern credits or subsidies for the Kama automobile  works, but guarantees from the Russian Government for commercial  and foreign investment in the joint-stock company.</p>

			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / World Trade News: Coface hit by strong franc ECONOMIC recession and currency devaluations against the franc have made an increasing number of French exporters' clients unable to pay their bills, France's export credit agency, Coface, has warned. In an interview in Le Figaro yesterday, Mr Alain Paupert the Coface director responsible for short-term risk cover, said the premiums his agency charge French exporters for insuring payment of their goods 'will no longer' cover the bad debt claims on it. Coface paid out FFr400m (Pounds 48m) in 1992, a year which saw 210,000 European companies go bust, with the bankruptcy rate rising by 50 per cent over two years. In normal times, bad debt claims on Coface amount to about 1 per cent of the total export business it insures, but this rose to 1.8 per cent in the second half of last year. Spain has apparently become the riskiest destination for French exports, with bad debt claims amounting to 3.8 per cent of Coface-insured business there. But Mr Paupert said that French companies pay an average of 0.43 per cent of total export turnover to get Coface cover, with the range of charges varying between 0.3 and 0.9 per cent. The agency says it may raise the top level on a case by case basis but is urging French exporters to redouble the care with which they choose clients. Prime Minister Edouard Balladur will brief the Commission in Brussels on June 3 on France's views about the need to broaden the Uruguay Round negotiations to take in all issues with all Gatt participants, not just focus on agricultural trade with the US. The EC executive does not usually expose itself to direct lobbying from a single EC leader, and the move underlines the determination of Brussels and Paris to bring the Gatt issue to a head.</p>

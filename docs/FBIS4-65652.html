			<p>BFN     [Text] Government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis has said  that Rauf Denktas' ongoing statements about progress in the  confidence-building measures are part of his tactics to avoid  being accused of responsibility for the deadlock by the UN  secretary general's report. Kasoulidhis added: On the basis of  the official briefing by Gustave Feissel, no progress was made  in Vienna. The spokesman made it clear that the Cypriot  Government does not want to discuss with the United Nations or  anybody else anything beyond the 21 March document, which the  Cypriot side has accepted as it stands. Kasoulidhis noted: Any  talk with us is out of context, since the negotiations are being  held with the other side.    Answering a question, the government spokesman said there is  no information about the United Nations having amended the 21  March document, and added that the time limits the Security  Council set for discussing the confidence-building measures have  expired. Kasoulidhis stressed: What is expected following the  UN secretary general's report is to determine alternative ways  of promoting the UN resolutions. Our side will cooperate only  through this process.</p>

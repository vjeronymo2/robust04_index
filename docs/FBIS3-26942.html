In the field of agricultural production, the total grain  output hit 2.03 million tonnes, breaching the 2 million-tonne  line for the first time, up 11 percent on the previous year.  The total output of oil-bearing crops was 63,000 tonnes, up 1.4  percent on the previous year. The total output of  sugar-yielding crops was 480,000 tonnes, 30,000 tonnes more than  the previous year. The total output of aquatic products was  15,000 tonnes, up 12.5 percent over the previous year. Both the  cultivated area for and the output of vegetables and other cash  crops increased by a wide margin. The numbers of butchered  pigs, cows, and chickens climbed, and total meat production was  greater than inthe previous year. The task of afforestation was  overfulfilled, and there was a bumper fruit harvest. Gross  agricultural output value stood at 3.187 billion yuan, up 6.7  percent over the previous year in terms of comparable items.    Township enterprises gained a robust momentum of growth,  with  1993 gross output value likely to reach 2.9 billion yuan, up 36  percent over the previous year. Individually owned and  privately owned enterprises grew rapidly, with their workers  accounting for 61.4 percent of the total number of workers  employed by township enterprises, and their output value  accounting for 50 percent of the total output value of township  enterprises, so they have become the mainstay of this region's  township enterprises.    In 1993, the peasants' per capita net income was 667.04  yuan,  an increase of 7.8 percent compared with the previous year.    The year 1993 was a difficult one for the rural economy, and  also a year in which party committees and governments at all  levels strengthened agriculture and made earnest efforts. To  boost agricultural production and increase the peasants' income,  the autonomous regional government set up a leading group for  rural work to coordinate and strengthen the comprehensive study  of rural work. Departments concerned at all levels  conscientiously served agricultural production and discontinued  unreasonable charges, with the result that the peasants' burden  decreased by 6.2 percent acorss the region as compared with the  previous year. Large numbers of cadres at the basic level  energetically helped peasants explore ways to prosperity and  solve problems arising in the course of agricultural production  in every possible way so as to promote rural economic  development.    The year 1993 was one in which the market mechanism was  strengthened. Most agricultural products were open to market  forces, control over the marketing of grain was entirely lifted,  and market building was accelerated so that the economic  vitality increased noticeably. The region made new progress in  developing a highly efficient agriculture that provides greater  and better yields. First, the structure of the growing industry  was adjusted at a greater pace according to market needs, and  the mix of crops, of varieties, and of growing techniques also  was improved. The area sown to barley -- which is used for  brewing beer -- and to beans increased 71 and 43 percent,  respectively, over the previous year. The area sown to perilla  seed, vegetables, asparagus, and artificially cultivated  licorice root also was expanded. A total of 169,000 mu of  one-tonne-yield-per-mu fields, as well as 22,000 mu of  "twin-thousand [shuang qian 7175 0578] fields" were built across  the region. The greenhouse area increased to 6,179 mu, with the  maximum per-mu value coming to 20,000 yuan. Second, various  stereoscopic compound growing models [li ti fu he zhong zhi mo  shi 4539 7555 1788 0678 4429 2784 2875 1709] were spread and  became important means of increasing production and income. The  stereoscopic compound area sown to grain, oil-bearing crops,  sugar-yielding crops, and vegetables -- including the area for  interplanting wheat with corn -- was to the tune of 2.758  million mu across the region. In the irrigated area, the  stereoscopic compound growing area constituted 48 percent of the  total area sown to crops. In the mountain area, peas were  interplanted with potatoes, so that summer crops could be  supplemented with fall crops, and vice versa, with the result  that the per-mu output value increased by 50 to 80 percent.  Third, to meet the market needs, many production bases for  superior and quality crops were built up, and an integrated  system for production, processing, and marketing was formed. A  more dynamic market mechanism greatly adjusted peasants'  operational behavior and fluctuations in the prices of  agricultural products told them they must choose efficient  products and trades. This was an important reason for the  increase in peasants' income last year.    The year 1993 was one in which the rural economy and society  developed hand in hand. Since the beginning of last year,  another 13 central market towns have been built or reformed, and  a total of 87 million yuan has been spent on the construction of  market towns. The area of newly built housing in rural areas  totaled 1.25 square meters, and the quality and functions of  housing were greatly improved.    In 1994, the rural areas will face new opportunities and  challenges. The major reform measures taken by the state with  regard to finance, taxation, banking, investment, foreign trade,  and state enterprises will give an enormous impetus to  agricultural production and the rural economy, but they also  will entail some undesirable effects, owing to the great  adjustment in interest relationships. Therefore, we must effect  a strategic change in our guiding principle for rural work in  order to meet the needs of the new situation. We must make  setting up a market economy system our goal, focus on increasing  peasants' income, accelerate rural reforms, and adjust the setup  of production in rural areas at a greater pace. Organizations  at all levels must seize the opportunity, make concerted  efforts, and continue to clear the way to forge ahead to add new  luster to rural areas across the region.</p>

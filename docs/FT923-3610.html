			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / World Trade News: Russian helicopters may fly to Turkey's aid - Ankara is looking to Moscow for arms to fight Kurdish separatists IN THE rugged mountains on the borders of Turkey, Iran and Iraq more than 100 Turkish soldiers and Kurdish guerrillas died last week in the worst clash of the eight-year separatist conflict. With the war escalating rapidly - more than 1,000 have died so far this year  -and some western countries banning arms sales to Turkey, Ankara has turned to Russia in search of weapons supplies. The two countries are looking at a barter deal whereby Turkey would supply various goods and services in return for Russian helicopters and armoured personnel carriers. Western defence officials say the initial decision to consider Russian equipment was for political rather than military reasons - the idea was first mooted during a meeting between President Boris Yeltsin and Prime Minister Suleyman Demirel at the Black Sea Economic Conference in Istanbul in June. But Turkey has increasingly identified a more immediate need to strengthen its rapid reaction capability in the Kurdish conflict. Under a Dollars 2bn proposal, the armed forces have invited bids from western defence suppliers for 200 large combat helicopters, although budget pressures have delayed any early decision. The government procurement agency SSM also has a collaboration with FMC of the US to make armoured vehicles. This project has been plagued by disputes with the army over sub-contracts for the engine and night-sight equipment. The latest moves suggest Turkey is reconsidering some of these long term joint manufacturing programmes, in the wake of escalation in the fighting. Earlier this year, Ankara asked companies in the helicopter tender to resubmit bids to include an off-the-shelf purchase of up to 50 helicopters, the remainder being part of a long term co-production deal. Meanwhile the Turkish police negotiated the purchase of armoured personnel carriers from Cadillac Gage of the US, using credits from the US export import Bank. Last month Mr Vahit Erdem, head of SSM, sent a team to Moscow. Mr Ismet Sezgin, the Turkish interior minister, confirmed a commission had been set up to evaluate the MI-17 troop carrying helicopter, and the BTR-60 eight-wheeled armoured personnel carrier. However, the Turkish army, as distinct from the police, has said it is not interested in the deal, and is said to have advised the police against acquiring the smaller MI-24 Hind-D combat helicopter which is also on offer. The exact cost of the deal is a matter of speculation, although Turkish reports suggest the deal could be as much as Dollars 300m. Settlement is likely to be part of the gas protocol under which Turkey takes Russian natural gas in exchange for goods and contracting services. Turkey is initially looking to acquire 20 MI-17s at a cost of Dollars 50m. Turkey has reportedly been asked for assurances that the arms would not be sold to third parties. Both Turkey and Russia are concerned at the growing conflict in the Caucasus, where Turkey is anxious not to be accused of siding with the Moslem Azerbaijanis against the Christian Armenians who have historically enjoyed Russia's support. By buying Russian Mr Demirel may also be seeking to deflect criticism of his fragile coalition government, under attack at home for failing to curb the PKK guerrillas, and internationally for the heavy-handed methods of the security forces. Before the war with Iraq, Switzerland banned arms sales to Turkey because of its mistreatment of Kurds, affecting purchase of the Oerlikon gun for the armoured personnel carrier. In March, Germany suspended arms shipments after television reports claimed former East German armoured personnel carriers supplied by Bonn were being used to put down Kurdish demonstrations. Significantly, it was the BTR-60 armoured personnel carrier which was at the centre of that dispute. The German agreement stipulated the equipment could only be used in Nato's defence. If Turkey is now to acquire the Russian BTR-60, it will be hard for the Germans to protest again, as no such restriction is likely to be written into the contract with Moscow. Turkey could then use its mixed stock of BTR-60s with impunity to put down its Kurdish rebellion.</p>

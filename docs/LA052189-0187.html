			<p><P> May 21, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NONFICTION IN BRIEF: CITY MOVES A USER'S GUIDE TO THE WAY CITIES WORK BY  STEPHEN FRIEDMAN (MCGRAW-HILL: $22.50; 310 PP.)  </P> <P> "City Moves" initially seems too good to be true, with intriguingly titled  chapters (e.g., "The Theatrics of City Life") promising to demystify the ideas  of hundreds of urban and regional planners. And unfortunately, this is a case  where first impressions prove correct, for in order to view all of these  theories in one glance, Stephen Friedman is forced to stand at such a distance  from them that colors fade and details become obscure.  </P> <P> Failing to evoke the wonder of cities -- the way they choreograph social  rituals, for example, or parent their populations -- "City Moves" is burdened  by verbose definitions ("Community has been defined by the sociologist Gideon  Sjoberg as 'a collectivity of actors sharing a limited territorial area as the  base for carrying out the greater share of their activities' ") and curious  statistics whose origins are left unexplained (Why does Los Angeles -- a city  made of suburbs -- not even make his top-22 list of the most "suburbanized  major U.S. Cities"?).  </P> <P> Reminiscent of a high school geography textbook, this dry text might help  explain American students' chronic apathy toward geography. In a National  Geographic Society survey conducted last year, for instance, less than 25% of  first-year American college students could find Japan, Iran or other newsworthy  countries when presented with a world map.  </P></p>

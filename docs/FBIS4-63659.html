			<p>BFN     [Text] The political situation in Crimea was discussed  during a meeting of the Crimean Tatar people's mejlis, which  took place in Simferopol. A resolution in connection with the  danger of an armed conflict arising in Crimea was adopted. It  speaks of the unlawfulness of the latest decrees by the Crimean  president and Supreme Council which led to the political  situation becoming more complicated. In this connection, the  resolution says, all bodies in the system of national  representation of the Crimean Tatars, should be guided by the  norms of international law, the constitution, the laws of  Ukraine, and the decisions of the kurultay of the Crimean Tatar  people's mejlis. All the necessary measures not to let  compatriots be drawn into resistance against the Ukrainian state  should be taken, says the resolution of the Crimean Tatar  people's mejlis.</p>

			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Oce-van der Grinten cuts forecast OCE-VAN DER Grinten, the Dutch photocopier and office equipment manufacturer, yesterday forecast a 15 per cent decline in full-year net profit, a downward revision of earlier projections, prompted by an unexpected 16 per cent decline in third-quarter net profit. The company, which had projected a rise in results for 1991-1992 ending December 31, said net profit in the three months to August 31 dropped to Fl 18.8m (Dollars 11.4m) from Fl 22.5m a year earlier. Sales were up 3 per cent at Fl 641m. It blamed the continued weak state of the economy in most of its main markets, as well as the rise of the guilder against the dollar. In the first half, Oce had reported an 8 per cent rise in net profit. News of the decline caused Oce's shares to fall sharply on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange, where they closed down 19 per cent at Fl 38.50 from Fl 47.50 on Friday. Oce is the first large Dutch company to release its third-quarter figures, with most others due to report in late October and early November. The figures mean Oce's net profit in the first nine months was virtually flat at Fl 70.0m.</p>

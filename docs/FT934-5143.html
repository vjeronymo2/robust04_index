			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Conservative rebels find much to welcome - Backbench reaction It was a clever Budget and a very well-crafted one. That was the overwhelming verdict of Tory backbenchers. Even MPs who have rebelled on important issues over the past 18 months - often to the intense discomfort of the government - were yesterday queueing up to pay chancellor Kenneth Clarke their compliments. Of course, there were isolated gripes. Mr John Butterfill, the MP for Bournemouth West who earlier this year campaigned hard for a revision to proposed changes in the North Sea tax regime, said he was concerned at Mr Clarke's decision to underfund the deficit. This was 'not something I would want to see perpetuated.' Mr Nicholas Winterton, the MP for Macclesfield who has been a staunch opponent of imposing VAT on fuel, said the proposed changes in eligibility for unemployment benefit were 'unfortunate.' But neither thought backbench concerns were serious enough to trigger a full-fledged rebellion. 'I cannot see anything I will be rebelling on,' Mr Butterfill said. He added that it was a good Budget for small business. Mrs Teresa Gorman, the strongly Euro-sceptic MP for Billericay, said the Budget - though 'full of good things' - confronted the government with an acid-test: would it be able to exercise as tight a control over its in-house expenditure as it has promised? 'If you presented a company budget on the grounds it was going to become efficient in two or three years, I don't think you would please the shareholders,' she said.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Shan Liang (0830 5328): "The Festive Candle </F> Drops Blobs of Wax Like Tears -- A Look at the Loss of Teachers  at Shanghai's Institutions of Higher Learning," excerpted by Lao  He (0525 0149) from SHANGHAI RENCAI SHICHANG BAO (SHANGHAI  TALENT MARKET JOURNAL) 1993, trial publication No 43]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] A certain relevant party  conducted a large-scale survey of 116 institutions of higher  learning in 24 cities, among them also Beijing and Shanghai,  with the result that 28.5 percent of the teachers at these  institutions subscribed to "will definitely move, if I have a  chance," 44.3 percent were for "thinking of moving but have  certain concerns" and "thinking of moving but am unable to do  so," and only 5.8 percent subscribed to "do not intend to move,  the present place is ideal."    Taking only Fudan University, "the top-ranking university  south of the Changjiang," as example: During the entire 1980's,  this university hired 1,442 new young teachers, of whom 402 have  by now again left the university. Among these, 384 went abroad  for further studies, and 28 [sic!] transferred domestically to  other positions with better salary and welfare conditions. The  total number of young teachers that left the university  accounted for 28.2.percent of those newly higher during the  corresponding period. The well-known International Journalism  Institute of the said university's Department of Journalism had  been famous in China and abroad for its teachers, who, all in  the prime of their lives, had displayed outstanding talent.  However, in the short space of a few years, they were gone,  leaving an empty place where only one lonely teacher remains, so  that many subjects can no longer be taught. A responsible staff  of the personnel department told this reporter that the  university is now loosing about 200 teachers every year. An  analysis of these shows that by age groups most are middle-aged  and young, by specializations most are teachers of presently  crucial subjects and subjects with practical applications, and  as to their quality, most are outstanding teachers proficient in  key subjects. The loss of all these teachers is indeed having an  ever more evident adverse effect on the quality of instructions.    During the interviews and investigations, this reporter  found  out that because many teachers could make their own arrangements  about time, they decided on a more practical way out, namely  taking up concurrent jobs. Concurrent jobs are of various  different patterns: some jobs require fixed attendances so many  times a week, in some cases offices are set up at home, while  remuneration is by salary, by pieces, or by time, and incomes  vary. According to incomplete statistics, among teachers aged  below 40 in Shanghai institutions of higher learning, 40 percent  have concurrent jobs; the purpose of these is two-fold, namely:  first, to improve the economic situation, and second, to achieve  a certain self-worth. If these two tracks should collide at any  time, the decision in eight, nine out of ten times is "better  quit and go elsewhere." These people constitute an unsteady  element among university teachers and are of a proportion that  must not be ignored. In the first half of 1993, an outstanding  young teacher in the physics department of Fudan University was  faced with an uneven scale, to weigh between a 200 yuan and a  2,000 yuan income, and he chose the latter. He abandoned his  speciality and abruptly flung himself into the ocean of  commercial affairs, to become a salesman, roaming all over the  country. For a time this made big waves in society, but whether  he was praised or berated for it, the fact remains that he was  gone.    The specific places to which these Shanghai college and  university teachers are actually moving are the "three capital"  enterprises, and the financial, banking, tax, industrial, and  commercial sectors, where they vie with each other for  positions. This shows that individual income is the most weighty  argument that determines the moves of the teachers.    Another one is: going abroad for further studies. In the  last  two years the frenzy for the TOEFL [Test of English as a Foreign  Language] has somewhat cooled down, but going abroad is still a  major aim that college and university teachers, especially the  younger ones, aspire to, and they now begin to extend the scope  of their destinations for studying abroad beyond the United  States to Singapore and other small countries. There is also a  new trend in this rush to go abroad, when they formerly went  abroad it was purely to pursue studies, but now many directly go  to take up employment. According to statistics, for almost half  of those who go abroad on state stipend or at own expense it is  like in the old verse "the yellow-crane flies off, never to  return." Even among those college and university teachers that  go abroad on scholarly exchanges or scholarly cooperative  activities, many settle down in the foreign countries.    The great loss of college and university teachers actually  is  due to complex and manifold reasons. When college and university  teachers in 116 institutions were questioned, "what is the main  reason for your decision to quit?" the answers were, in this  order: "unsatisfactory social environment," "no prospects for  advancement in sight," "poor living conditions and family  considerations," etc.    One teacher expressed it this way: The reason why our group  of people endured in poverty is none other than the idea of  making a contribution to instruction and research. We make no  high demands, maintaining a somewhat higher than middle level in  society and having a relatively quiet environment for study and  private life, that is all. If these demands cannot be met with,  we cannot see any value in our profession and should make a  change. However, when it really comes to change the old habitat,  there is much inner conflict and pain; discarding 20-odd years  of work is like cutting off a "first love."    There was a certain Li, a young teacher of modern literature  at a certain teachers training college in Shanghai. As an  excellent graduate, he was kept on by the college, and for a  time he was happy and proud to wear the red college badge.  However, we don't know when it started, but the color and lustre  of the badge faded. Last year, he took his family back to the  countryside. There, some puny, average-grade former schoolmates  of his were spending money 600 yuan at a time, visiting  sing-song places and dance halls, and there again spending lots  of money, all that left this highly talented man speechless with  surprise and suddenly feeling that he cannot associate with them  anymore. This matter really stirred him up inwardly, although he  was ordinarily of a quiet disposition. Formerly, he lived the  quiet life of a man devoted to studies, who after class would  discuss the present state of literature with groups of students,  obsessed with literature, and in fact he was extremely happy.  However, now his frame of mind is quite different. If he could,  he would warn youngsters who are full of poetic sentiment and  picturesque ideas that literature cannot take the place of life,  but may only be an embellishment of life. Look at yourself, at  your low status of literary types within the system, when will  you ever amount to anything in the pecking order according to  qualifications. Finally, this teacher who is long over the age  of 30, who had delved into the books and passed the examination  of graduate student at another university, decided to change his  profession.    An old professor of economics at a famous university had  formerly always thought it shameful to talk of money, but has  recently had good reason to worry about money. He had some  manuscripts on his specialty, which were the fruit of many  years' painstaking labor, and which he wanted to present to the  university as his valuable gift on retirement. However, since  they were mostly on theory and too highbrow to be popular, the  publishing company told him: either you underwrite the sale of  5,000 copies, or contribute 10,000 yuan to the expenses. This  sum is not a small amount for a teacher who has been poor all  his life, and was completely beyond the old teacher's means.  Later, a very farsighted industrialist generously came to the  rescue at the last moment. After this, the professor was  painfully regretting: "If I would be 20 years younger, I would  also move out." [passage omitted]</p>

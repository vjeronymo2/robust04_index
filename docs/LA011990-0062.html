			<p><P> January 19, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> 7 BUSINESSES CITED IN LIQUOR SALES;  </P> <P> ALCOHOL: SIX PACOIMA BARS AND A DRIVE-UP DAIRY OUTLET WERE REFERRED TO CITY  OFFICIALS IN AN EFFORT TO CURB DRUNK DRIVING.  </P> <P> Los Angeles police this month referred six Pacoima bars and a Sylmar drive-up  dairy to city zoning officials in a continuing crackdown on businesses they say  contribute to drunk-driving accidents in the northeastern San Fernando Valley.  </P> <P> The Pacoima bars were accused of serving intoxicated customers and hiring  B-girls who encourage male patrons to buy drinks. The dairy store allegedly  sold alcohol to a minor. Sgt. Rick di Stefano, a vice supervisor in the Los  Angeles Police Department's Foothill Division, said Thursday that he had named  the businesses in a Jan. 3 letter to the city's Office of Zoning  Administration.  </P> <P> The actions were part of a continuing campaign against public drunkenness in  Pacoima. The Foothill Division -- which includes Pacoima and Sylmar -- has led  the city in alcohol-related traffic accidents.  </P> <P> In December the Los Angeles City Council ruled that three Pacoima stores could  no longer sell cold beer or wine, single cans or small bottles of alcoholic  beverages. The council also required earlier closing times for the stores. The  council acted after police and zoning officials heard complaints from nearby  residents and found evidence that drunkenness and crimes stemmed from liquor  sales at these stores.  </P> <P> Di Stefano said officers believe the additional businesses targeted this month  continued to serve intoxicated patrons, based on interviews with suspects  arrested on alcohol-related charges.  </P> <P> "That's the reason why we've been hitting these bars," he said. "We wanted to  get to the root of the problem. We've talked to them over and over again. It  still goes on because there's a tremendous profit" in alcohol sales.  </P> <P> The Pacoima bars cited by police are El Capri, El Norteno and El Parian, all on  Van Nuys Boulevard; El Palenque and El Michoacano, both on San Fernando Road;  and the New Top Hat Bar on Laurel Canyon Boulevard. Also cited was the  Alta-Dena drive-up dairy on Foothill Boulevard.  </P> <P> A spokesman for El Parian declined to comment. Owners or managers of the other  businesses could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> To curb abuses, the city can impose new zoning restrictions on such businesses,  including limiting their hours, requiring them to use state-licensed security  guards and prohibiting B-girls, said associate zoning administrator Jon Perica,  who received di Stefano's letter.  </P> <P> If undercover officers continue to find illegal activity, the city can shut  down a business, he said.  </P> <P> Perica said the Los Angeles City Council in December upheld his decision to  place two liquor stores and a food market, all in Pacoima, on six-months  probation in an earlier crackdown on businesses considered a public nuisance.  </P> <P> He said he is awaiting a Jan. 31 council vote that would pay for more zoning  staff members to investigate the latest seven businesses targeted by Foothill  officers.  </P> <P> The same seven are also facing administrative charges by the state Department  of Alcohol and Beverage Control, said F.J. (Jim) Smith, the ABC's Van Nuys  district administrator. He said the ABC has already suspended licenses at two  of the bars -- El Capri and El Norteno -- for serving obviously intoxicated  customers.  </P> <P> The ABC can seek suspension or revocation of a license to serve alcohol, but  Smith said city zoning officials have broader authority and can crack down on a  business more quickly.  </P></p>

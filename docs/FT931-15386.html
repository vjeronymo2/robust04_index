			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / Businesses confident that economy will start to recover in 1993 MOST BUSINESSES are confident that the economy will start to recover in the first half of this year, but business failures will remain at a high level, Emma Tucker writes. A survey by Lloyds Bank and forecasts for business failures from Trade Indemnity, the independent credit insurance group, gave mixed signals on the outlook for the economy yesterday. The survey from Lloyds, which covered almost 1,500 businesses in manufacturing and services, shows a sharp variation in optimism by region and industry. London and the south-east have the highest expectations, as does the north of England. The Midlands is relatively pessimistic. Trade Indemnity is forecasting total business failures of 1,780 for the final quarter of 1992, 1 per cent higher than in the previous quarter. That would bring the total number of failures for 1992 to about 7,525 compared with 7,807 in 1991. The outlook for this year is for a further decline of about 10 per cent.</p>

"After thorough investigations and numerous interviews, we  officially declare that neither our leadership nor individual  member-clubs of the Legion have ever commented on the  president's letter to the commanders of the Armed Forces'  branches, or on the relations between the president's Military  Office and the Army's General Staff.    "We are convinced that the aforementioned report has cited  the Legion in a deliberately distorted fashion, prompted by  evidently biased political intentions.    "Similar `operations' are likely to provoke tension among  our  members. They are contributing to a politicization of the  soldiers' life which is counterproductive to the consolidation  of the Bulgarian Army's fighting ability."</p>

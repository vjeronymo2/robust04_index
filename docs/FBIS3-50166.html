			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with President Ion Iliescu by Dorina Baesu in </F> Bucharest on 20 January: "Brief Interview With Mr. Ion Iliescu  After the Talks Between the Social Democracy Party of Romania  and the President: `I Agree With Salagean'"]    [Text] [Baesu] Today, during your talks with the Social  Democracy Party of Romania [PDSR], the PDSR leaders asked you to  further remain actively involved in the negotiations it will  conduct with the opposition. Are you going to do that?    [Iliescu] This is what I am actually doing. I believe that  today's discussions with the PDSR are the start of the second  stage of the meetings with all parties. I will stay involved.    [Baesu] Therefore, the negotiations with the opposition --  which, in the opinion of Mr. Nastase [PDSR executive president],  are bound to last a long time -- will begin. Until then, a  coalition government between the PDSR and the Romanian National  Unity Party [PUNR] will be formed. Will this coalition not  damage the country's image?    [Iliescu] It might do some damage, but this is the formula  that resulted from the discussion.    [Baesu] But why was it absolutely necessary to form a  government with the PUNR?    [Iliescu] This is not necessary, but inevitable.    [Baesu] Why?    [Iliescu] Because it offers stability, for the time being.    [Baesu] PUNR senator Viorel Salagean claims that such a  government will not only damage the country's image, but it will  not last too long, either.    [Iliescu] I agree with Salagean, but the party should also  agree with him.    [Baesu] What do you have to say about the fact that several  politicians, including Adrian Nastase, were accused by Corneliu  Vadim Tudor [president of the Greater Romania Party-PRM] of  being CIA spies?    [Iliescu] This is stupid and despicable. He could be sued  for that. It is proof of his irresponsibility.    [Baesu] Nevertheless, the PRM is still the PDSR's ally. Is  such an alliance not being perceived negatively?    [Iliescu] I agree with you. It is perceived rather badly.    [Baesu] Then, what should be done to ensure that the PDSR is  no longer obliged to have such an ally as the PRM?    [Iliescu] We must create another political climate, of  understanding among the democratic forces. However, I would  like to emphasize that I do not identify the parties with their  figures. A man is not a party. As a matter of fact -- I do not  want to name any names right now -- there are certain elements  in the Democratic Convention (people -- our editorial note),  that are by no means any more credible or desirable than some  individuals from the current majority.    [Baesu] Still, none of the Convention's leaders has ever  made a statement like Corneliu Vadim Tudor's.    [Iliescu] Well, let me assure you that they have made quite  a few statements, and how!    [Baesu] Can you give some concrete examples...    [Iliescu] Is there a need for examples? By the way, what  newspaper do you work for?    [Baesu] ROMANIA LIBERA.    [Iliescu] You see? Just the insolence of the writings of  Petre Mihai Bacanu and Octavian Paler would suffice as examples  of that.</p>

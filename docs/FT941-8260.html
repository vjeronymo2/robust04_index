			<p>940221 FT  21 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Age structure not least of Irish economic problems Sir, Dr Garret Fitzgerald, (Personal View, February 15) in his consideration of positive aspects of Ireland's economy, focuses on the age structure of the population as the constraint on raising living standards, but Ireland has a productivity/competitiveness problem as marked as this. While low living standards in Ireland are largely a function of the small proportion of the population in employment, this is only partly caused by the greater proportion of young people in the Irish population. In 1992 just over half of the Irish population of working age were in employment, but in the UK the proportion was almost 70 per cent. There has been a long-run failure to generate a sufficiently large industrial base and this failure is a reflection of a lack of competitiveness. In the aggregate statistics the unfavourable performance of domestically owned firms is masked by the very rapid growth of the foreign-owned manufacturing sector. Detailed study of Irish indigenous enterprises in sectors such as farming, transport, energy, tourism and business services indicates that productivity levels are substantially lower than those in the UK. Irish products are frequently uncompetitive with respect to price or non-price characteristics. The increase in gross domestic product has indeed been rapid during 1988-1993 but it is usually accepted that GNP provides a better indicator of the Irish population's material well-being because it makes allowance for the burgeoning outflows of profit and interest payments (these outflows are one consequence of the heavy reliance on international firms). GNP per capita remains only two-thirds of the UK average. Dr Fitzgerald considers the last five years, but when a longer time perspective (eg, the last 30 or 70 years) has been considered it has usually been concluded that the rate of 'catch up' on the levels of GDP per capita in the UK or elsewhere is less than that which could be reasonably expected. Past performance suggests there is more wrong with the Irish economy than simply a delayed transition to low birth rates.

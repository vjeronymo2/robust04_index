The vintage Bordeaux in the  kitchen cabinet? The Los Angeles Fine Arts &amp; Wine Storage Co. has a better  idea. Designed to store anything from Picassos to port in temperature- and  humidity-controlled compartments, this high-tech storage facility just opened  in West Los Angeles.  </P> <P> "It's a way to offer first-class protection for any collectible," says Bo  Zarnegin, whose own family's art collections inspired the warehouse idea.  </P> <P> The art compartments are spacious enough to hold anything from paintings to  statues and large-scale 3-D pieces. In addition to the large walk-in  compartments, which can expand even beyond 20 feet square, there's a  comfortable art-viewing and wine-tasting room where collectors and enophiles  can trade, sell or sample one anothers' wares. The Los Angeles Fine Arts &amp;  Wine Storage Co. also features around-the-clock electronic security service and  personal-access key cards.  </P> <P> Collectors of other types of valuables can lease compartments to keep furs,  rugs, film, tapes and legal files safe from theft and the elements.  </P> <P> Los Angeles Fine Arts &amp; Wine Storage Co., 2290 Centinela Ave., Los Angeles;  (213) 447-7700.

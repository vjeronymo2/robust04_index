			<p>930601 FT  01 JUN 93 / International Company News: IRI chief to take charge of Stet telecoms unit MR Michele Tedeschi, mana-ging director of Italy's IRI state holding company, is to become managing director of its Stet telecommunications subsidiary in a surprise transfer. The change reinforces signs that IRI, which reported a 1992 loss of L4,809bn (Dollars 3.27bn) and faces group debts of about L73,000bn, will be whittled down while Stet and Finmeccanica, its two biggest subsidiaries, gain weight. Both companies are already stock market listed and are set to be progressively privatised. It also confirms that Mr Romano Prodi, IRI's chairman until 1989, who was reappointed last month will now take full control of running the group. Under a 1992 restructuring which marked Mr Tedeschi's promotion to managing director, the chairman was relegated to a largely representational role while the managing director was given mainstream management responsibilities. Mr Prodi did not indicate any desire to change matters after his re-appointment and seemed content with the role of IRI's 'ambassador' to the business and finance community. However, under yesterday's changes, he will assume Mr Tedeschi's powers as soon as the latter is transfered later this week. Mr Tedeschi, who has started reshaping IRI, faces the task of restructuring Stet, which controls Italy's state-owned telecoms activities. The sector, split between seven companies, is due to be rationalised by the end of 1995. The process, likely to meet stiff management and political resistance, is an important step in the government's privatisation plans, with the eventual single utility, tentatively called Telecom Italia, one of the most attractive privatisation candidates. Mr Tedeschi's move will also create ructions within the highly-politicised Stet group, where there are two managing directors, both of whom will be reassigned. Mr Biagio Agnes was yesterday reconfirmed as Stet's chairman, but he will also see his role diminished.</p>

			<p>Article   Type:CSO     [Editorial Report] The 30 December Budapest daily MAGYAR  HIRLAP reported that the National Federation of Associations of  Job Seekers and Unemployed (MAEOSZ) believes that the  unemployment problem is growing despite National Labor Affairs  Center (OMK) figures that show the opposite. According to the  paper, MAEOSZ executive president Zoltan Zenkovics and associate  president Jozsef Simon said in interviews that while OMK data  claiming a steady drop in unemployment from 700,000 in February  to 635,000 in November are technically correct, they "do not  reflect societal developments realistically." Since last spring  the "official classification criteria used by the labor affairs  centers have changed," the officials asserted. In any case, they  said, in 1993 the overall situation of the unemployed "continued  to deteriorate" because unemployment benefits have been reduced  from two years to one and the actual value of benefits has  eroded. "It has therefore become impossible to halt  impoverishment, and even on the governmental level they admit  that half a million people will never again be able to return to  the work force." Long-term unemployment also has an impact on  the family, creating "a spiral that may go downward with  frightening speed." While unemployment benefits have have helped  some people get a new start, in counties such as Nograd, Somogy,  and Zala most of the unemployed find themselves "without any  options," the officials said.    Zenkovics and Simon charged that government agencies have  failed to cooperate with MAEOSZ's efforts to improve the  employment situation. MAEOSZ and the Ministry of Labor worked  out a "cooperation plan" but MAEOSZ "waited in vain" for an  actual agreement from that ministry, while the Ministry of  Public Welfare "did not respond at all" to MAEOSZ's requests. In  the officials' view, as long as they took "a tolerant stance"  they could not get the government to "consider them a partner in  working out a clearly conceived employment policy." Therefore,  according to MAGYAR HIRLAP, the officials expect that MAEOSZ  will be "forced" to "resort to other--strictly legal--measures."  First it will have lawyers examine the parts of the social  welfare law that appear to be "unconstitutional," and then it  will express its protests through county meetings and hunger  strikes.</p>

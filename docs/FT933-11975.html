			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / Leading Article: Gravy train IT WAS BAD enough for present and future pensioners in the Maxwell business empire to be fleeced by the late, unlamented publishing baron. For them now to be plucked by the accountants and lawyers as well, in one of the most unwieldy insolvencies of all time, is simply unconscionable. Yet that, to judge by the evidence in the Social Security Select Committee's latest report, is precisely what is happening. No doubt the eight professional firms that have so far charged Pounds 51.6m for their insolvency work are convinced that this is a fair reward for a difficult job. But the Select Committee, chaired by Mr Frank Field, is rightly sceptical. It is a scandal. The Maxwell insolvency, like those at Polly Peck and Bank of Credit and Commerce International, is exceptionally complex. There are, inevitably, jurisdictional problems in unwinding cross-border business groupings. Record keeping in the Maxwell companies was often shoddy in the extreme. Where fraud is involved, the purpose of the records is anyway to throw the outside inquirer off the scent. It follows that the Maxwell insolvency was always going to be an expensive classic of its kind. But the size of the professional charges, which Mr Field's committee expects to top Pounds 100m by the end of the process, raises wider questions about the checks and balances in the insolvency system. Preferential and secured creditors, by definition, have little reason to be concerned about costs because they have first bite at the cherry. The real burden falls on the unsecured creditors; and they have difficulty second guessing large firms of accountants and lawyers if they suspect that they are stringing out a receivership or administration for the sake of generating additional revenue. The obvious sanction - going to court - is an expensive option. Nor does it seem worth the bother of making a fuss if the pay-off amounts to 4p rather than 3p in a pound that has already been whittled away by prior claims. Mr Field puts a case for an independent state-appointed monitor of the larger insolvencies, along the lines of the US-style examiner. This certainly merits consideration. But the real flaw in the system stems from the undue weight given to the claims of the Inland Revenue, the Customs &amp; Excise and the banks, relative to those of ordinary creditors including pensioners, for whom the protracted nature of insolvency proceedings is a particularly harsh burden. Equally striking is the inability of the Maxwell pensioners to seek redress against a government which may be in breach of legal obligations, for want of resources. A review of the system, says the committee, is a priority. Yes, indeed. There has to be a middle way between the US Chapter 11 system, which leaves the bankrupt company in the hands of the management that wrecked it, and the UK approach, which leaves the cadaver at the mercy of the professionals.</p>

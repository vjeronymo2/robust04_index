			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Neil Lewis] </F>   [Text] Johannesburg April 26 SAPA -- African National  Congress President Nelson Mandela is confident of retaining the  support of the security forces, particularly the higher  echelons, if he is inaugurated as president on May 10. He made  this comment on Tuesday [26 April] in his final press interview  before the Independent Electoral Commission releases the results  of the nationwide poll.    The ANC leader, certain to be the country's first black  president, is scheduled to cast his vote at a polling booth just  outside Durban on Wednesday -- the day general voting kicks off.    Speaking to SAPA in the Presidential Suite of a downtown  Johannesburg hotel on Tuesday afternoon, Mr Mandela said he had  received assurances from SA Defence Force and SA Police generals  of their full co-operation. "We are exchanging information and  removing any feeling of insecurity on their part, and I think we  have established good relations between ourselves and the  security forces.    "I have addressed firstly a meeting of all the police  generals together with Mr Hernus Kriel (law and order minister)  and his deputy, and the full staff of the SA Defence Force  together with Minister of Defence Mr Kobie Coetsee and his  deputy, Mr Wynand Breytenbach."    Mr Mandela added perceptions of the security forces at  grassroots level would also have to change to enable better  interaction between them and the community at large. "It is a  question of supporting the security forces and making them  legitimate and credible in so far as the masses of the people  are concerned. Members of other population groups have already  been drawn into the command structures of the security forces,  and this has helped to restore confidence in the security forces.    "We are departing from the case where blacks are only there  to carry out orders of the command strctures that are solely  white."    The ANC believed in additional steps to galvanise the  community behind the police and army. "It is also a question of  a change in training of the security forces...that they should  be trained in such a way that the poor image they have amongst  the black community is removed.    "The introduction of community policing is also going to be  a  major factor in improving the relationship between the security  forces and the masses of the people," the ANC president said.    The ANC and government had already gone far towards  redressing racial imbalances in the security forces, he added.</p>

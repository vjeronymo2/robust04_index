			<p>BFN     [Text] Popo Molefe is the premier candidate on the ANC's  list for the North West Province. Let's find out more about him.    Popo Molefe, well known for his days as general secretary of  the United Democratic Front, is now a member of the ANC's  National Executive Committee. Born in Sophiatown in 1952 to a  farm laborer and a domestic worker, Molefe was looked after by  his aunt, but he was harassed by white children when visiting  her in the white suburb where she worked. Molefe, who went to  school in Soweto was convinced by his experiences of racism as a  child to become involved in the Black Consciousness political  movement. Active in political organizations from 1973, he was  involved in planning the well-known 16 June march in 1976, for  which he spent seven months in detention.    Molefe noticed that many white people were sympathetic to  the  students cause and that it was black policemen, as well as  white, who were using brutal force against the students. He  realized that his views of South African conflict, simply being  between black and white, did not hold. By 1981 Molefe had  become involved in the community organizations like Motlana  Soweto Committee of ten and was committed to the principle of  nonracialism. He was later to participate in the formation of  the United Democratic Front, playing a prominent role as the  organization's general secretary and being instrumental in their  campaign against the tricameral parliament.    In 1985, Molefe, along with 22 others, was charged with  treason, relating to the disturbances in the Vaal Triangle the  previous year. During the three-year trial, which became known  worldwide as the Delmas trial, the accused were denied bail.  Molefe and four others were convicted of treason and given  10-year sentences. Molefe was to spend the rest of that decade  imprisoned on Robben Island. He was there even when his fellow  prisoners, like Walter Sisulu, convicted under charges similar  to his in the mammoth Rivonia trial, were released.    In December of 1989 the appeal court quashed all convictions  and Molefe and his co-accused were released from prison. They  were greeted by jubilant supporters who were welcoming back  their leaders in a time when the country was on the verge of  change. Molefe immediately returned to working in political  organizations and was elected to the ANC's National Executive  Committee at its first congress in 1991. Molefe, who was  appointed to the crucial job of heading the ANC's elections  department, is the 16th candidate on their election list.</p>

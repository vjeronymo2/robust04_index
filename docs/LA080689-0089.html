			<p><P> August 6, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OFFSHORE DRILLING AND OIL TANKERS  </P> <P> In response to "Short-Change Artists," editorial, July 26:  </P> <P> I've always taught my children that if they make a mess, they clean it up.  Perhaps that's why it's difficult for them to understand why Exxon can cease  cleanup operations in Alaska with less than 25% of the polluted coastline  cleaned up.  </P> <P> I cringe every time I see television footage of this disaster and shudder to  think that this beautiful coastline may very well be damaged forever. That will  most certainly be its fate if Exxon is allowed to "call it a day" in September.  </P> <P> Exxon owes it to the environment, and to the nation as well, to live up to its  promises of a complete cleanup. Exxon should be on the job until the last  possible weather-permitting moment, and return in the spring to do more, much  more, than merely "survey" the situation.  </P> <P> Secretary of the Interior Manuel Lujan also knows who is responsible for full  cleanup. Let's hope President Bush can see as clearly.  </P> <P> DEBBY LeGARRA  </P> <P> Hacienda Heights  </P></p>

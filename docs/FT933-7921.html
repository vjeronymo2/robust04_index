			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / Slower S Korean growth seen PRIVATE economic institutes yesterday predicted that South Korea's economic growth would slow to around 5 per cent this year as a result of the introduction of the real-name financial system last week. The real-name system, which bans the use of aliases in financial transactions, is meant to reduce the size of the underground economy. Four institutes, all associated with the country's large conglomerates, said the new system will further dampen corporate investment by creating business uncertainty. It will also cause financial difficulties for small and medium businesses, which are dependent on the unofficial kerb market for credit. The kerb market is likely to be severely hurt by the new measure because it is largely funded by money held in false-name accounts. The government in January set a growth target of 6 per cent for 1993 against last year's 4.7 per cent, the lowest growth rate in 12 years. But the central bank last month estimated that GNP growth will reach 5.7 per cent because of declining corporate investments, which contracted by 7.3 per cent during the first half of 1993 due to sluggish demand both at home and abroad, excess production capacity and higher interest rates. The central bank also blamed production disruptions caused by strikes at Hyundai, the nation's largest conglomerate, for slower growth. Inflation is expected to accelerate to between 6 and 7 per cent from previous predictions of 5 to 5.5 per cent, according to the institutes. This reflects growing private spending as consumers liquidate their false-name bank accounts and buy goods to avoid paying tax on their savings.</p>

			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / Bosnia peace talks fail over land demands THE BOSNIAN peace talks in Geneva broke down yesterday, prompting Lord Owen, international mediator, to warn of the danger of a deeper slide into 'anarchy and war' if the three sides did not reach a speedy settlement. Lord Owen said: 'The talks have failed because there is not an agreement on the map. They all want more territory than either of the others is prepared to give.' However, along with his fellow mediator, Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, he held out hope that the proposal would remain on the table. The alternative was 'fragmentation, anarchy, warlords and chaos'. He admitted that 'barring a miracle or a sudden shift in one of the parties' he did not expect negotiations to resume today, although he said the leaders of the three warring parties - Croats, Moslems and Serbs - had agreed to remain in Geneva until today. None of the leaders ruled out resuming talks in the near future. Amid fears of a surge in fighting in central Bosnia, the republic's president Alija Izetbegovic, a Moslem, said his army would 'respect the ceasefire. But, of course, whether there will be war or not does not depend only on us'. Serbian president Slobodan Milosevic, who appeared enraged by the breakdown of the talks, said he was sure the Bosnian Serbian forces would respect the ceasefire, which was put in place earlier this week. Earlier Croatian president Franjo Tudjman predicted that the fighting would continue unabated. Clashes have intensified in central Bosnia as Croat and Moslem troops have tried to grab more land. Members of the Moslem delegation were reported to be in tears as the Croats left the talks. Mr Izetbegovic blamed the collapse on the failure of Serb and Croat leaders to make essential concessions to his land-locked republic. 'The minimum of minimums which we put before the conference today would have allowed an economically and political viable state,' he said. 'They (Serbs and Croats) have rejected our requirements and therefore this round of talks failed,' he told a news conference. The key sticking point appeared to be Moslem demands for the restoration of 'ethnically cleansed' territory in eastern and north-western Bosnia and the land connection to the sea at the Adriatic port of Neum. The setback surprised observers after a day in which all three sides had indicated they were on the verge of agreement. Mr Charles Redman, President Bill Clinton's special envoy, said: 'I think it is a tragedy that they could not come to a solution.' In an attempt to persuade the Bosnian delegation to accept the offer, which included a widened 1.8 mile corridor connecting the three eastern enclaves but failed to meet any other Moslem demands, Mr Milosevic held a 15-minute private session with Mr Izetbegovic. Earlier, the Bosnian government had laid the ground for a possible agreement by scaling back its demands for territorial concessions. Mr Izetbegovic had put forward a proposal that his republic should receive an additional 4 per cent of land on top of the 28 per cent already allocated under the proposed partition. Previous Moslem proposals had demanded at least 10 per cent more land. Amid fears of renewed fighting, Lt Gen Francis Briquemont, UN commander in Sarajevo, yesterday travelled to Medjugorje, near Mostar, to supervise ceasefire talks between Bosnians and Croats. Meanwhile, Mr Manfred Worner, secretary-general of Nato, yesterday met Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general, in Geneva, to discuss the possible deployment of more peacekeeping troops.</p>

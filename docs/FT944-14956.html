			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / International Company News: Chemicals group plans acetics sale Rhone-Poulenc, the French chemicals group, plans to sell its acetics business as part of a strategy to get out of making intermediate and basic chemicals. Rhone-Poulenc management has convened a meeting for October 27 at the works council at the group's Pardies acetics plant in south-west France to explain the move. An announcement will be made later that day. The group gave no further details, except to confirm the impending sale was in line with the intention of Mr Jean-Rene Fourtou, president, to sell Dollars 1bn-Dollars 1.5bn in assets over the next 18 months. These would be chiefly in intermediate or basic chemicals for which his group had no in-house use or where the scale of its activity was dwarfed by that of others. Acetics form part of Rhone-Poulenc's organic and inorganic intermediates division, which last year recorded sales of FFr14.1bn (Dollars 266m). It is estimated that acetics accounted for just over FFr2bn of this. According to one report in Paris, Union Carbide of the US might be interested in buying the unit from Rhone-Poulenc.</p>

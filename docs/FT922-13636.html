			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / International Company News: Chief executive of ANZ to retire ONE of Australia's most senior bankers, Mr Will Bailey, is to retire as deputy chairman and group chief executive of the Melbourne-based ANZ Bank. His retirement heads a 'changing of the guard' at ANZ, also involving the retirement of the bank's chairman, Mr Milton Bridgland, who will leave the board in June on reaching retirement age. The bank announced the changes yesterday, saying Mr Bailey would retire in the December quarter of this year and his successor would be announced in a few months. But some clues on the succession were given with the appointment of two new executive directors, the bank's New Zealand chief executive, Mr Alister Maitland, and the chief general manager of Australian retailing operations, Mr Don Mercer. Mr Bridgland will be replaced as chairman by ANZ director Mr John Gough, who is also chairman of Pacific Dunlop, the Melbourne industrial conglomerate. The changes end an era of growth at ANZ since Mr Bailey became chief executive in 1984. This included integration of the UK-based Grindlays banking group and New Zealand's Postbank. Mr Bailey also presided over the takeovers of the National Mutual Royal Bank and the Town and Country Bank. His tenure saw ANZ group assets jump to ADollars 98bn (USDollars 75bn) from ADollars 35bn and gross income grow to ADollars 7.6bn from ADollars 3.3bn. Mr Bailey was the main architect of an ambitious attempt by ANZ to take control of the country's second largest life insurance group, the National Mutual. The plan was blocked by the federal government, forcing the parties to fall back on increased commercial links. But earlier this year the two organisations announced they would develop their businesses independently. Mr Bailey's era has also seen a large rise in ANZ's bad debts through exposure to a brigade of so-called Australian entrepreneurs. No leading Australian bank has been immune from these effects which have hit earnings. Yesterday the bank also said it was restructuring and reducing non-core assets 'to ensure that the bank makes a strong recovery from the adverse effects of the 1980's. 'This programme is progressing well, and Mr Bailey feels the time is opportune to retire,' ANZ said.</p>

			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / Ousted former premier joins Thai coalition: Chatichai's move comes after defection by five parties General Chatichai Choonhavan, the former Thai prime minister whose government was overthrown in a military coup d'etat on the grounds of corruption in 1991, yesterday agreed in principle to bring his Chart Pattana (National Development) party into the coalition government. Mr Chuan Leekpai, the present Democrat party prime minister, was forced to woo Gen Chatichai after one of the five parties in the ruling coalition defected last week. The defection of Gen Chavalit Yongchaiyudh's New Aspiration party left Mr Chuan in charge of only a minority of the seats in parliament. Without an alliance with one of the opposition parties, Mr Chuan would probably be obliged to dissolve the assembly and call an early general election. Yesterday's provisional deal - an agreement on the cabinet seats to be allocated to the new coalition partner has yet to be finalised - has raised eyebrows among even those Thais used to the byzantine negotiations that characterise the country's corruption-prone politics. Only days ago, Chart Pattana solemnly declared along with other opposition parties that it would never join Mr Chuan's coalition, and yesterday's announcement prompted accusations of hypocrisy and betrayal from Gen Chatichai's former opposition colleagues. Mr Chuan and Gen Chatichai are longstanding rivals, but the two sides are justifying their plans for an uncomfortable marriage of convenience by pointing to the need for stability. 'Foreign investment and economic development have been disrupted by the halting of government,' Gen Chatichai told reporters yesterday. 'So we decided to help to uphold the stability of government in the national interest.' Stock market investors have been watching the political situation nervously, and on Friday the Stock Exchange of Thailand index fell 2.4 per cent following Gen Chavalit's defection and reports that he had held talks with fellow army generals. The market was closed yesterday for a holiday. Yesterday's provisional agreement marks the end of a two-year period during which political parties were divided into 'angels' or 'devils' in the Thai press, depending on whether they supported or opposed pro-democracy demonstrations in 1992 during which 50 protestors were shot dead by Thai troops. Mr Chuan's coalition, elected in September 1992 for a four-year term following the violence in May, was composed largely of 'angelic' members of parliament. In spite of having being overthrown by the armed forces a year earlier, Gen Chatichai and his supporters were pro-military 'devils'. Even before the coalition's deal with Chart Pattana has been finalised, commentators are starting to predict its collapse because another party  - Palang Dharma (Buddhist Force) - will have profound differences of opinion with Gen Chatichai and his followers.</p>

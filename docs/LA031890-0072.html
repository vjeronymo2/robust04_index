			<p><P> March 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMENT ON PENSIONS HAS A FAMILIAR RING  </P> <P> In the March 4 article "First Executive Casts a Shadow Over Pensions," an  officer of First Executive states: "The company is in very robust financial  health. Even suggesting we won't perform on (pension) obligations is  far-fetched." This parallels the statements from their allies and  partners-in-junk at Drexel Burnham Lambert who denied the filing-for-bankruptcy  rumors the day before the actual occurrence.  </P> <P> ALBERT C.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 18 TASS -- Russian President Boris  Yeltsin said that Russia and the Caucasus are inseparable and  added that the dreams of Caucasian peoples for well-being and  flourishment can come true only through solidarity in  constructing a democratic society, through public and  interethnic accord and civic peace.    "In our conscience Russia and the Caucasus are inseparably  linked notions. One cannot be imagined without the other",  Yeltsin said in an address to the Caucasian peoples on Tuesday  in connection with the 130th annivesary of the end of the  Caucasian war which resulted in the incorporation of the  Caucasus into the Russian empire.    "The events of a more than a century-long history return us  to those years when the interests of the Russian empire, Great  Britain, France, Iran and Turkey clashed in the struggle for the  Caucasus. All those states bear a share of moral responsibility  for the sufferings of the highlanders", the president said.    Yeltsin admitted that in various times the Caucasian war was  assessed in different ways. "At present, when Russia is building  a law-governed state and recognises the priority of human  values, a possibility emerges to objectively assess the  Caucasian war as courageous struggle of the peoples of the  Caucasus not only for survival on their own land, but also for  the preservation of their self-styled culture, the best traits  of the national character".    The president added that the problems inherited from the  Caucasian war, including the return of descendants of Caucasian  refugees back to their historic motherland, should be solved at  the international level through negotiations of all the  interested parties.    The Caucasus should be "forever with Russia" -- these words  are dear for every Russian, Yeltsin stressed.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Anna Melnikova] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 13 TASS -- "The State Duma denounces  NATO's unilateral coercive actions in Bosnia-Herzegovina," a  statement adopted by the State Duma, the lower house of Russia's  new parliament, on Wednesday said. The statement said that  Russian parliamentarians "demand immediate convocation of the  U.N. Security Council to discuss the situation, following NATO's  military interference in the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina and  adoption of measures to prevent escalation of this explosive  situation."    Deputies called on all warring sides to immediately end the  bloodshed and start negotiations on a comprehensive ceasefire  agreement.    The statement stressed the need for urgent deployment of  U.N.  forces in the Gorazde area and adoption of measures to prevent  provocations on any side.    Duma deputies urged the Russian Foreign Ministry to "work  out  an active position to set up an effective mechanism of  implementation of U.N. Security Council resolutions in order to  ward off the use of force in the future bypassing Russia."  Deputies rejected amendments to the statement proposed by  several factions, including recommendations to the Russian  Government, urging it to submit proposals to the Security  Council to lift economic sanctions on Yugoslavia or to refrain  from signing the Partnership for Peace programme.</p>

			<p>940421 FT  21 APR 94 / Political Notebook: Strategy of survival for Major At Westminster there is the uneasy calm of a phoney peace. In Downing Street the atmosphere is strained. Mr John Major has six weeks to put in place a strategy for survival. Nobody at Westminster is quite sure what to expect from the local elections on May 5 and the European elections on June 9. That the Tories will do badly is taken for granted. The scale of defeat is harder to gauge. But the anecdotal evidence is deeply depressing for the prime minister. Tory MPs returning from the campaign trail say the party faithful are still seething with resentment. Once-loyal activists are in no mood to be told that better times are around the corner. Local loyalties might blunt the disenchantment in the council elections. But there seems a real prospect of a collapse in the Tory vote in the European poll and the Eastleigh by-election. The possibility can no longer be discounted that the party will be placed third in a national election for the first time in living memory. The immediate aftermath of the European poll will be the most dangerous moment of Mr Major's premiership. A formal leadership challenge must wait until November. But the risk is of an irresistible tide sweeping him from office during the summer. Mr Major insists that nothing will shift him. But remember Margaret Thatcher's words just a day before she was driven from Downing Street: 'We fight on. We fight to win.' So the focus of Mr Major's strategy for survival is to hold on in Downing Street from June 9 until the summer recess in mid-July. A challenge in November will have to be tackled if and when. There is a chance that by the autumn economic recovery will have refloated his government. To have a decent chance of surviving until then Mr Major has to do two potentially contradictory things. He must maintain the visible loyalty of his cabinet - it was the desertion of her colleagues which finished Mrs Thatcher. But he must also shake up the government - and his own team of personal political advisers - in a way which begins to rebuild his shattered authority. On paper Mr Major should have little trouble securing cabinet backing. Save for the two leading contenders for the succession - Mr Kenneth Clarke and Mr Michael Heseltine - most see a vested interest in sticking with the present leader. That might change swiftly if the election results trigger a collective nervous breakdown on the back benches. Supporters of Mr Clarke and Mr Heseltine are not alone in planning for other contingencies. Mr Michael Portillo's friends have been testing his support on the back benches. Mr Major has rejected advice to bring forward the cabinet reshuffle to before June 9. Aides insist he will not be panicked and are talking in terms of July. But it could come within a week or so of the European election if the poll results are as bad as some fear. Mr Major must make extensive - although not draconian - changes. He must give the cabinet a sharper political edge, replacing administrators with street-fighters. Among the names already at the top of Downing Street promotion lists are Mr Stephen Dorrell at the Treasury, Dr Brian Mawhinney at health, Mr Jonathan Aitken at defence and Mr David Davis at public services. In a government underburdened with talent all have a decent claim to seats at the top table. Their elevation - and the sacking of a number of middle-ranking timeservers - would make way for a wave of promotions from the restless back benches. The relative youth of the new team could be balanced by the return of one or two heavyweights from the 1980s. The idea is a long shot, but Lord Howe might calm a fractious House of Lords. If Mr Heseltine cannot be persuaded to take the party chairmanship, Lord Walker might be the next best choice. Mr Major has also been told in the strongest possible terms that he must replace Mr Graham Bright, his lacklustre parliamentary private secretary, with an adviser of stature and reputation in the Commons. The common denominator linking those on the list of possible cabinet departures is that they would be either unwilling or unable to damage Mr Major from the back benches. Mr John MacGregor, Mr Peter Brooke, Mr John Patten and Mr John Gummer would not become plotters. Overall, the ideas now being floated have the makings of a credible if less-than-fireproof strategy. But Mr Major, who sometimes appears at once stubborn and indecisive, must strike the right balance between unaccustomed boldness and more familiar panic.</p>

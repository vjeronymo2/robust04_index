			<p>930504 FT  04 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Euro Disney regains favour with rise of 3% WITH THE UK and Tokyo closed yesterday, trading in continental Europe generally lacked direction and volume. PARIS lost a little momentum in late trading as the CAC-40 index finished 2.06 easier at 1,936.97 Euro Disney was back in favour, improving some 3 per cent to close FFr2.35 up at FFr75.85, helped by last Friday's announcement of the appointment of a new chief financial officer. There was also speculation that the group might reveal further restructuring proposals this week. Michelin suffered another fall after Friday's 6 per cent loss, finishing FFr1.80 lower at FFr141.70. Peugeot declined FFr5 to FFr550. CGIP, up FFr20 at FFr1,090, confirmed that it had sold part of its stake in Cap Gemini Sogeti, down FFr4.50, or 2.3 per cent, at FFr189.00. MILAN found comfort in the growing view that Prime Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi will be able to stitch back together a broadly based coalition government, possibly including the ministers who resigned last week. The Comit index rose 12.32, or 2.3 per cent, to 538.62, but trading volume was restrained. This takes prices back to around the levels of last Thursday before the resignations prompted a sell-off by private domestic investors early on Friday and institutions stepped in to recoup some of the losses. Analysts expect the market to remain around current levels until Mr Ciampi's government announces a programme and puts it to a parliamentary vote on Thursday. Mr Fabio Ferrando of Albertini in Milan said: 'Given the current political and economic situation, the support of the PDS to the government would be a good thing because broad support will mean a strong government able to take tough decisions. The next step will be to see whether Mr Ciampi wins Thursday's vote of confidence. Investors will take their cue from that.' Stet, the state telecommunications group was a strong performer, rising L104, or 4.1 per cent, to fix at L2,635, before slipping to L2.630 after hours. FRANKFURT managed a slight improvement but most traders said activity remained unenthusiastic. The steel strikes in east Germany, which began yesterday, are also affecting investor interest. The DAX index was finally 1.97 ahead at 1,629.16, after a day's low of 1,617.40. Among the actives, Siemens gained a net DM1.10 at DM617.10, after falling to DM611.30. Continental was up DM2.20 at DM194.50 ahead of reporting a group net profit of DM133m, against a DM128m loss in 1992. Elsewhere in the automotive sector, Volkswagen lost 70 pfg to DM323.00 as BMW and Daimler made respective gains of DM6 and DM2 to DM470 and DM577.50. ZURICH was higher in active trade, led by chemical and pharmaceutical shares, and the SMI index rose 23.1 to 2.152.8. Ciba-Geigy, SFr14 ahead at SFr604, was the most active stock. The sector is gaining ground on a growing view that US plans for health reform may be less damaging to the outlook for Swiss groups than originally thought. Roche certificates rose SFr80 to SFr4,370. Bearers in Ems Chemie, a medium-sized chemicals group, rose SFr150, or 7.5 per cent, to SFr2,150 after the company said it planned to buy back up to 250,000 of its own bearer shares for SFr2,200 per share. Among banks, UBS bearers added SFr7 at SFr941. Ascom bearers came under renewed pressure, falling SFr70, or 5.6 per cent, to SFr1,180. BRUSSELS remained weak in very thin trading. The Bel-20 index fell 8.0 to 1,189.52, registering the market's 12th fall in the last 13 sessions. Petrofina, which breached a technical support at BFr8,500 on Friday, recovered most of its intra-day losses just before the market closed, ending BFr20 easier at BFr8,380, having dipped to a low of BFr8,220. UCB, the chemicals, pharmaceuticals and packaging group, extended recent weakness, closing a net BFr350 down at BFr21,525, after an 18-month low of BFr21,300. Delhaize, the retailer that was hit on Friday by union action and picketing at its stores, was one of the few blue chip stocks bucking the lower trend. It finished BFr6 firmer at BFr1,144. AMSTERDAM, which was closed on Friday, was able to react to the news that Philips was to end its partnership with Matsushita in their semiconductor joint venture. Philips' shares gained Fl 1.00 at Fl 25.60, but after a day's high of Fl 26.10. The CBS Tendency index ended 0.4 easier at 107.2. STOCKHOLM was active in banking issues, with S-E Banken up SKr5 in the 'A' shares to SKr17, on expectations that the sector is set for recovery. The Affarsvarlden index rose 1.8 to 1,032.2 in turnover of SKr635m. Stora lost SKr11 to SKr299 ahead of tomorrow's first-quarter results. HELSINKI fell on profit-taking. The HEX index closed 13.6 down at 1,173.5 in turnover of FM79.2m. ISTANBUL made a spirited early effort to maintain the upward momentum but a broad wave of profit-taking left shares slightly easier. The market index ended 2.33 lower at 7,805.31, bringing two-session losses to 91.61 since Thursday's all-time high of 7,896.92, which was the 10th closing peak recorded during April. The index had surged 271 points, taking it above the 8,000 level, in the first half-hour before profit-takers stepped in. Investors became cautious ahead of the expected formal nomination today of Mr Suleyman Demirel as president, intensifying speculation about who will take over as True Path Party chairman and prime minister if parliament elects him. The Eurotrack 100 index was unavailable owing to the closure of the London Stock Exchange.</p>

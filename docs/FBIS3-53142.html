Speaking to journalists this evening, Sha'th pointed out  that  an agreement had been reached about the (?self-rule measures) in  the fields of telephones, electricity, roads, civil register,  economic issues, and some other issues as part of the civilian  subcommittee work. He added that the questions of water and  archaeology have not yet been discussed, while there is a  dispute over the planning of urban areas. He pointed out that  so far 20 out of 38 items on the agenda of the civilian  subcommittee have been finalized.    Dr. Sha'th noted that the drafting subcommittee will begin  its work tomorrow, Wednesday, to formulate issues related to the  final agreement, the Palestinian authority, and legal matters.  Sha'th stressed the need to discuss the points of difference  during the current talks and not wait for a later stage. He  noted that the security subcommittee, headed on the Palestinian  side by Hasan 'Asfur, concluded its meeting today and will meet  again tomorrow, Wednesday, in view of the important security  issues on its agenda. Expressing optimism, Sha'th added that the  peace process will continue so long as there is goodwill. He  stressed that the three-week period is enough time to reach a  draft agreement.    Commenting on Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres'  remarks  today that there will be no Israeli withdrawal by 13 April as  scheduled, Sha'th said: I know that the talks may take more  than three weeks, but this depends on the two sides' commitment  to reach peace.</p>

If one doubts this, it is enough that  they would listen to the salvos of criticism and denunciations  of the decision that resounded throughout the world.    Greece apparently thinks that it could assert its long-range  interests through a painful pressure upon the young republic at  a very painful moment for the Balkans. Athens certainly wants  to make sure that in the future Skopje will not present any  territorial claims regarding the northern Greek province of  Macedonia.    Such a possibility exists and it cannot be refuted a priori.  However, this is not the greatest problem at the present.    It is a question for the future whether Skopje will declare  territorial claims regarding Greek territory. However, an  economic blockade, which is taking place at the present, already  represents a clash between Greece and Macedonia.    This bodes great dangers against the background of the  existing situation in the Balkans. One of them is in forcing  the Macedonians into a too close alliance with Albania in order  to obtain a commercial outlet to the world. This could violate  the very fragile ethnic-political balance in Macedonia. The  second danger is in Greece trying to apply pressure on other  Balkan countries, including Bulgaria, in an attempt to prevent  Macedonia from obtaining a commercial outlet. This could  violate the fragile political balance in the southern Balkans.    One should not be puzzled if it appears that, while thinking  about its long-range interests, Greece neglects the importance  of the immediate ones. The trouble is that the states bordering  on Greece could also pay for this mistake, despite the fact that  this is the last thing they want.</p>

			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Keyboard to help the disabled A computer and keyboard package, designed to help disabled employees use standard computer systems, has been introduced by KCS and HM Systems, two UK companies. The keyboard consists of a touch-sensitive flat pad which can be overlaid by a number of standard or customised keysets. The overlays can be programmed so that one keystroke can perform a series of functions. The keyboard is designed to make inputting information easier for people suffering from motor disabilities and it is also suitable for people with visual disabilities, because the keyset overlays can be designed using different colours and key sizes. The system, which is compatible with standard software, does not need hardware or software modifications. The computer and keyboard package costs Pounds 1,500. KCS: UK 0703 584314</p>

			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / Survey of Software at Work - Autumn 1993 (12): Whirlwind approach pays off - Strategic Planning / John Kavanagh takes a look at Woolworths' use of facilities management LATE last November, Woolworths was preparing to base its future computing on a new retail management program package running on its big IBM mainframe computer. Just 10 weeks later it had not only completely changed course to a network of minicomputers but had also contracted out the entire mainframe operation and 51 staff to a facilities management company. The moving force behind the dramatic turn of events was Mr Colin Cobain, recruited from Rumbelows last September as head of information technology (IT). He arrived as Woolworths was looking at installing new point-of-sale equipment in its 800 shops to enable it to record sales of individual items. This will allow the company to keep much tighter control over sales, orders and inventories and to move into electronic trading with its suppliers. At present Woolworths can only record sales at department level, with no breakdown by item. Cobain felt that going with a mainframe package would take too long and that switching to smaller computers would be not only quicker but also cheaper. He immediately started considering setting up a network of IBM AS/400 minicomputers running a package from software company JDA. This soon looked promising, so at the end of November the mainframe project was frozen. By early January the JDA package and the AS/400 were chosen as the way ahead. A month later a Pounds 10m three-year facilities management contract covering the existing mainframe unit was signed with the services company, Hoskyns. Woolworths now has five AS/400s at its computing centre in Manchester, also the home of the IBM 3090 mainframe. The new strategy proved itself almost immediately: it took just two months to get the JDA package installed and running. Woolworths expects the new approach to cut its computing costs by at least 20 per cent a year once everything has been moved across. However, while that is happening, the company still depends on the mainframe systems. 'We didn't want to spend much time on a service which was winding down but we still needed it at the same quality,' says Cobain. 'We therefore needed to both free ourselves to concentrate on the new systems and give the people supporting the old systems an employer that could offer them a career and a future, which we couldn't' Woolworths saved time in selecting a service supplier by consulting another facilities management user and using its short-list of Hoskyns, IBM and GSI. Woolworths also talked to EDS. 'Hoskyns came across as far more capable of handling the staffing issues,' Cobain says. 'In addition, Hoskyns already has a data centre in Manchester. Our work and the staff will move there next Easter, so there was minimum disruption for our people. Hoskyns guaranteed there would be no redundancies for at least six months: this is more than our own staff have. 'Looking after our staff was a primary goal.' The 51 people moving to Hoskyns were the mainframe operations staff, plus applications software development and maintenance people. Woolworths still has 140 computing staff, now working on the new systems. Money is being saved on the mainframe operation. 'The costs of running your own machine are constant,' Cobain says. 'You can't pay IBM less for software licences just because you're using the machine less. At present, we're paying Hoskyns charges for use of the service, plus a management fee. When the operation moves off-site next Easter we'll gradually pay less.' The main benefit, however, lies elsewhere. 'The real saving is in management time,' Cobain says. 'Without facilities management we wouldn't be able to move to our new systems so quickly, because our managers would still be concerned with the mainframe service. 'Moving totally to a new set-up demands full management concentration.' In keeping with the whirlwind approach to the whole strategy shift, Woolworths cut the contract negotiation time to a minimum by using solicitors Clifford Chance, because it had been involved in facilities management contracts before and had worked with Hoskyns. In July, Cobain moved to sister company Superdrug as head of logistics and systems - and also to a place on the board. He was at Woolworths for just nine months. But he certainly left his mark. A big attraction of the Woolworths contract for Hoskyns was that it took the company into the retail sector. 'This sector has adopted IT very rapidly, with moves into capturing item data at the point of sale and the use of electronic data interchange between retailers and suppliers, yet it has not been quick to go to outsourcing,' says Peter Falconer, Hoskyns' associate director responsible for marketing. 'This was therefore a good move for us.' Even so, Hoskyns took on what is in effect Woolworths' cast-off: a traditional central mainframe computer service. 'We have only signed two contracts of this sort - where the customer is switching to a new approach and there is a time limit - in the last two years,' Falconer says. 'Typically, as with the Woolworths contract, we take on what the customer is already doing and improve on it. Then we make significant changes, while still providing the same service. Then we start moving the customer's former staff around, as necessary for our own business. Finally, if we are closely involved as partners in the customer's strategy, we really do start changing things. 'So, although we might have taken on a mainframe initially here, we are moving with our customers and with the technology. We have mainframes - but we also have AS/400s and DEC Vax machines and Hewlett-Packard Unix computers.' Hoskyns also took on 51 Woolworths staff - 'We normally take on all the staff,' says Falconer. 'But it has to make business sense.' We never take people on with the intention of making them redundant. 'The first thing we do after a contract is signed is to counsel each person. We feel we're good at this: most of our people joined the company this way. 'It's normal for people's terms and conditions to be transferred intact. These often include location. This means people can move to Hoskyns' premises later rather than sooner but eventually they will have to move: for example in the Woolworths contract they would be redundant. Some staff would move fairly quickly to other projects in the region.' Falconer says the company can normally accommodate everyone. 'There are bound to be less able people, but we can find them jobs. Some people are happy to stay 'average.' As an IT company we can offer training to improve them and perhaps guide them into a job they can do well. 'However, these days most IT managers are pretty professional and have worked hard to get where they are. They're under pressure to be provide efficient services, so they've probably weeded out or trained the duffers.' Falconer offers another angle on the potential benefits for staff: 'We don't have a facilities management business as such: Hoskyns is the business. This means Woolworths people could move into our training group or into software products. The people come into the company, not into facilities management.' The problem with Woolworths' consideration of a big shift in technology was that all the 190 computing staff immediately started worrying about what it would mean for them. 'Anyone considering facilities management should let the staff know as soon as possible, because it means a major impact on them,' says Brian Booth, formerly capacity planning manager at Woolworths and now service planning manager at Hoskyns, working on the Woolworths contract. 'Woolworths could have told us earlier: not necessarily saying who would be going but at least giving us a clearer understanding of why facilities management was an option. 'The spectre of redundancy was talked about but this was nothing new, as redundancies were already happening in IT and elsewhere.' The staff were put in the picture 10 days before the contract was signed. The next they knew, Hoskyns had been awarded the contract. 'Generally, there was an initial feeling of bitterness, not against anyone in particular but as a reaction to the fact that you weren't sure what would happen,' Booth says. 'This is probably true of all facilities management deals.' Hoskyns 'went out of its way' to explain what was happening, he says. 'We were introduced to Hoskyns 24 hours after the announcement. There were presentations, an open forum and a buffet lunch. There were individual interviews immediately. 'They were clearly concerned about how people felt. Everyone I've talked to is very happy with the way Hoskyns handled it all. A couple of people were not comfortable about working for a services company but even they have changed their minds.' Booth says career development and training were quickly put in place. Some people were soon looking to move into other Hoskyns business units, still in the Manchester area. 'A more commercial focus emerged,' says Booth. 'Hoskyns improved the way we work and put best-practice in place. I feel we've enjoyed this improvement. After our initial fears we now cautiously feel that things are going OK.'</p>

			<p><P> December 25, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HOUSES ARE STILL HARD TO BUY, BUT THEY'LL GET HARDER TO SELL TOO  </P> <P> It'll be harder to sell a home next year in Orange County.  </P> <P> New houses are so expensive -- averaging more than $382,000 near the end of the  year -- that only a tiny slice of the county's population can afford them. A  lot of the customers for these pricey houses sold their older homes, using the  equity gained from the boom in values.  </P> <P> But the market for resale homes -- which is about four times larger -- has  slowed down too. Prices, according to experts, are just high enough at a median  $253,000 to be beyond most buyers' pocketbooks but not rising fast enough to  entice a lot of people to sell.  </P> <P> Altogether, sales of new and resale homes are down 27% this year, although that  doesn't look quite so bad when you realize last year was an unusually brisk  year for sales.  </P> <P> For the county's important home building industry, the upshot is that builders  have put up homes they haven't yet been able to unload in such places as Aliso  Viejo, the area west of Mission Viejo, and the new town of Rancho Santa  Margarita farther south and east.  </P> <P> All this is a far cry from last year, when prices were rising so fast that many  buyers jumped into the market with both feet, fearing they'd never be able to  afford a home if they didn't buy now. Almost anything the builders cared to put  up sold within days, and frantic buyers camped out in front of new  subdivisions.  </P> <P> But beginning late last year and continuing through this year, the market  slowed down. And it will be a lot slower next year, experts predict.  </P> <P> "For a couple of years, builders had to know more about crowd control than  selling," said Buck Panchal of the Meyers Group, a real estate consulting firm.  "Next year they're going to have to spend a lot more time finding out what  people want and how to market it to them."  </P> <P> That means prices won't rise much: The most optimistic estimates put next  year's price increases for new homes in the range of 5% and under. That's not  much more than inflation, which is expected to be around 4%.  </P> <P> And it's a long way from the astonishing 35% that new homes appreciated on  average in 1988.  </P> <P> Buyers will be choosier, impelled not by fear of rising prices but by genuine  need for a home.  </P> <P> "Most of the speculators have left the market, and the few people who can  afford a new home have definitely sobered up. They're a lot more discriminating  about what they're buying," said Kelly McDermott of Market Profiles, a housing  consultant.  </P> <P> The price of resale homes -- which accounted for about 80% of the roughly  40,000 homes sold this year -- isn't expected to rise much, either.  </P> <P> This year, for instance, the price of the average resale house will probably  end the year about 14% higher. In 1988, during the boom, it was 25%. Next year  it will be less than 9%, says Leslie Appleton-Young, an economist at the  California Assn. of Realtors, which tends to look on the bright side. A  gloomier appraisal comes from economists at Chapman College, who predict  resales houses will appreciate only about 2% next year, or only half the rate  of inflation.  </P> <P> Sales could be down 10% or more, says Appleton-Young.  </P> <P> "You just can't have prices go up 25% a year when incomes are going up only  5%," she said. "Something's got to give, and we're seeing that it's the sales."  </P> <P> Some brokers and builders concede prices may not go up much, but they say they  won't fall, either. That's because, they say, unlike in the oil states or the  slumping New England states, where home prices have dropped, the Southern  California economy will continue to create tens of thousands of new jobs. And  all those people will continue to buy houses even at high prices.  </P> <P> That theory's valid, but maybe only partly so. If you look beyond the simple  averages for home prices, you find that some builders have already dropped  prices on their most expensive homes or are offering cash incentives to buyers.  And some owners of older homes have taken their houses off the market rather  than sell at a price lower than their asking price.  </P> <P> "The fear that there won't be enough houses to go around or that interest rates  would keep going up, all that's considerably dampened now. And that means the  market's gotten soft," said Alfred Gobar, a Brea housing consultant.  </P> <P> "The guy that owns a $200,000 house doesn't have to worry that much about an  erosion in value," said Gobar. "But at the higher end, well, it's going to be  tougher to get a high price."  </P> <P> Looking beyond next year, though, a lot depends on factors far beyond the  control of the county's big housing industry, such things as a recession or a  rise in interest rates.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, a couple of trends that have emerged over the last few years will  continue into the new year and beyond, according to experts. Some of them are:  </P> <P> * The migration of the middle class to cheaper houses in the inland counties of  Riverside and San Bernardino. Orange County has more jobs, though, so many of  these people will drive back here to work over roads already clogged with cars.  </P> <P> * The people who are left will buy more condominiums and townhouses, the only  type of housing they can afford. A new condo cost an estimated $193,000 near  the end of the year, almost half the $382,000 a new house cost.  </P> <P> * Others will rent, and rents are expected to increase as the county's  apartments -- an estimated 4% of which are now vacant -- fill up. The average  rent for a two-bedroom apartment in the county's larger complexes runs between  $575 and $775 a month, according to the Apartment Assn. of Orange County.  </P> <P> * Anticipating higher rents, investors are combing the county in search of  apartment buildings to buy. Few owners are willing to sell, and prices are  high. While vacancy rates are double the 2% of a few years ago, the high prices  for the county's dwindling land supply are expected to keep apartment  construction down and make owning an apartment complex very lucrative in the  future.  </P> <P> * Some areas of the county that have yet to see a single home built on them  will come a step closer to construction, particularly on the the Irvine Co.'s  enormous landholdings. Among the projects making their way through the planning  process next year: Seven thousand acres just outside the city of Orange; and  the canyon areas just east of Anaheim. Construction could start late next year  on the ultra-expensive homes at the Irvine Coast between Newport Beach and  Laguna Beach. And Laguna Laurel, the Irvine Co.'s big community planned for  Laguna Canyon, is up in the air because of community protests.  </P> <P> * Houses will get still bigger on the average. Builders need to increase the  home sizes to justify the high prices. Thanks to the enormous influence of the  Irvine Co. on the market, many of these houses will be the pastel-colored  Mediterranean affairs favored by company Chairman Donald L. Bren.  </P> <P> * Everything else, of course, depends on roads: The big question is whether  enough of them can be built in time, since growth shows no signs of abating  either through an economic downturn or by some form of government fiat. Orange  County has grown so fast that it has outstripped the capacity of its roads, and  things are almost certainly going to get worse. The building industry this fall  failed to persuade the county's voters to tax themselves another penny on the  sales tax to raise money for building roads.  </P> <P> In the future, some experts worry, high home prices and the deteriorating  quality of life here -- symbolized by the horrendous commutes many Southern  Californians endure daily on the freeways -- may turn out to be as big a threat  to the Southland's economy as cutbacks in defense spending or slumping computer  sales.  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY HOME SALES AND PRICES LEVEL OFF  </P> <P> PRICES  </P> <TABLE

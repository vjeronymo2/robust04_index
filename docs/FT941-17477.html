			<p>940104 FT  04 JAN 94 / A new way of dealing with risk: Revised US capital rules for insurers Are risk-based capital rules about to do to the US insurance industry what they have done to the country's commercial banks? From this year, US property and casualty insurers will have to set aside minimum levels of capital, based on risks they run. This nationally applied system replaces a patchwork of state-level regulation under which most insurers had to meet only a simple solvency test. Similar capital rules for commercial banks, developed internationally in the late 1980s, forced banks to scale back their ambitions to conserve and build their capital. This helped drive borrowers and depositors away from the banks and towards the capital markets. As with the banks, the new regulations are likely to have two effects. The first is to reduce most property/casualty insurers' appetite for risk and encourage them to raise premiums more quickly than would otherwise be the case. The second is that insurance business will begin to by-pass the insurance companies' balance sheets altogether. Through off-balance sheet transactions and the use of derivatives, insurers could find ways to shift part of their risks to the capital markets. The new risk-based capital rules have been developed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, a grouping of state insurance regulators. Made jittery by the collapse of the Executive Life and Mutual Life companies in 1991, the commissioners decided to impose a more stringent system for measuring an insurer's financial health. Risk-based capital rules for life insurers, in force since the start of last year, have intensified the pressure on life companies to strengthen their balance sheets. As a result companies such as Equitable, in which Axa of France owns 49 per cent, have been busy rebuilding their capital. Also, the new rules have reduced the life companies' appetite for risk, says Ms Shelly Harris, an analyst at Standard &amp; Poor's. This has given extra impetus to the growth of variable life products, under which the investment risk is born by the customer, in preference to whole life products, where the insurer guarantees to pay a fixed amount. A similar response can be expected from the property/casualty insurers. They could also become more risk-averse, pushing up premiums and encouraging buyers of insurance to find other ways to cover their risks. 'Certain liability lines are heavily penalised (under the risk-based capital rules),' says Mr Steven Bolland of Gill and Roeser, a New York-based insurance broker. 'Premiums in some of the businesses which require heavy capital will need to get higher.' The complex regulatory regime agreed by the NAIC last month requires insurers to set capital aside against four types of risk. Credit risk, for instance, is defined as the risk that a reinsurer will default and not pay money due under a reinsurance policy. Insurance companies have to provide capital equal to 10 per cent of amounts covered under reinsurance arrangements - higher than the broad 8 per cent rule for credit risks established by bank regulators. That builds an extra cost into the insurance mechanism. In addition, insurance companies face capital charges to cover underwriting risk (the risk that their reserves will prove inadequate to meet future claims); investment risk (higher charges apply to more risky investments, like junk bonds or commercial property); and even growth risk (insurers which grow at more than 10 per cent a year are taking bigger risks and should set aside more capital, says the NAIC). Taken together, these rules are likely to constrain growth. Given that they come at a low point in the traditionally cyclical insurance industry, when many companies are already struggling to rebuild their capital, the rules may well bite with extra force. Last year, US property/casualty insurers raised Dollars 6.4bn (Pounds 4.32bn) of new capital between them. They also realised a record Dollars 10.4bn of capital gains. But with record catastrophe insurance losses and premium income hardly rising, they ended the year with only a Dollars 5.1bn addition to their combined capital base, a rise of just over 3 per cent. With the exception of 1990, every other year since the mid-1980s has seen double-digit growth. To try to protect their balance sheets, insurers could turn to derivatives as a way of shifting part of their risks to the capital markets. A number of derivatives houses are circling on the fringes of the insurance industry. At the forefront is said to be Bankers Trust, the commercial bank which has done the most to foster the use of derivative financial instruments, and Center Re Financial Products (CRFP), an offshoot of Zurich Re. Mr Richard Sandor, head of CRFP, argues the capital markets will one day provide a mechanism for transferring underwriting risks, just as they now transfer interest-rate risk. Given the revolution that has taken place in other areas of the capital markets, this does not seem a far-flung claim. Twenty years ago, the only way to participate in the mortgage industry was to buy shares in a company that made home loans. Now, a Dollars 1,500bn mortgage-backed securities market has opened up the mortgage industry to capital markets investors. A multi-billion dollar interest-rate swap market has revolutionised interest-rate risks. Mr Sandor, former chief economist at the Chicago Board of Trade who was instrumental in the launch of interest-rate futures 20 years ago, argues that the capital-constrained insurance industry will eventually go through the same process, with off balance-sheet vehicles and derivatives transforming the way risks are transferred. A trillion-dollar market in securitised car insurance policies may be some way off. But with tighter capital rules on insurance companies, such a development looks far more likely.</p>

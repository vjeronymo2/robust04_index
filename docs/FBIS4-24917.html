			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 4 (XINHUA) -- The 18th Pacific Science  Congress will be held in Beijing in June next year to discuss  issues that have a direct bearing on the continued social and  economic development of the world, especially that in the  Pacific region.    Some 1,500 influential scientists and social activists from  over 50 countries worldwide are expected to attend the  conference, launched by the Pacific Science Association, said  Zhou Guangzhao, the association chairman.    Zhou, also president of the Chinese Academy of Sciences,  said  that the congress will focus largely on more than 20 subjects,  including population explosion, resources crisis, environmental  deterioration, continued development, South-North cooperation,  social sciences, medical sciences, culture and art.    The Chinese Government is keen on the congress, the first to  be held in China, Zhou said. The founding congress took place  in Hawaii in 1920.    He said that the congress will display to the world the  great  achievements which an ever-opening China has scored in  scientific, technological, cultural, educational and many other  spheres. It also will promote scientific and technological  cooperation and exchange among countries in the Pacific region.    The Pacific science association is a multi-discipline non-  governmental international academic organization, of which China  is a founding member.    According to Zhou, the scale and influence of the Pacific  Science Congress has actually gone far beyond the Pacific  region. Scholars and representatives from Britain, France,  Germany, Belgium, Switzerland, Sweden, Norway, Austria, Finland  and some other European countries as well as from many island  countries in the Pacific Ocean, the Indian Ocean and the  Atlantic Ocean are expected to take part in the eminent science  congress.    Many international research programs, organizations,  academic  exchange and government institutions, as well as prominent  individuals have shown interest in the subjects to be covered by  the congress. Some will speak at the congress as special  guests, Zhou said.</p>

Diplomatic sources say the Thai Foreign Ministry in Bangkok  and embassy in Vientiane have been applying gentle pressure on  Lao authorities to proceed with the land sale.    It was agreed upon by both sides previously but the Laotian  Government has declined to finalise the deal, citing recent  legislative change forbidding land sales to foreign diplomatic  missions.    The dispute dates back to the period of former Thai foreign  minister Asa Sarasin who signed an Exchange of Notes with Lao  ambassador to Thailand, Bounkeut Sangsomsak, in 1992 for Bangkok  to purchase for 18 million baht about seven rai on the main  highway from Vientiane to the border checkpoint at Tha Deua.    It is planned to accommodate both a Thai diplomatic mission  and the embassy. The embassy in downtown Vientiane which now  houses both the chancery and the ambassador's residence would  house the latter only.    The Thai plans were blocked after Vientiane late last year  amended laws on land transactions.    Deputy Thai Foreign Minister Surin Phitsuwan raised the  issue  with Lao Foreign Minister Somsavat Lengsavat during a visit to  Vientiane last December.    Sources say there was no conclusive outcome as the Lao side  stood firm on its legal amendments.    The deadlock is causing budgetary problems to the Thai side.    According to the sources, about 30 million baht was  allocated  for the land deal and other related expenditure in the fiscal  1993 budget, which lapsed last September. The Chuan Likphai  Government subsequently extended the disbursement deadline of  this item to March 1994.    Since budgetary matters are normally subject to  parliamentary  approval, there is concern that it will be difficult to get  another extension if the March deadline passes without the deal  being consummated.    So the Thais are stepping up their campaign to persuade the  Laotians to honour the 1992 Exchange of Notes.    "As far as we are concerned, this is a fairly  straightforward  matter which the Lao side has to honour," a senior Thai diplomat  told INSIDE INDOCHINA.    "The Exchange of Notes is a legally binding commitment. If  (an international commitment of this nature) is over-ruled by  subsequent Lao legislative changes, who would be confident  enough to invest in Laos?"    The Thais, pressing for the land deal, are hopeful of a  positive conclusion before the March deadline.</p>

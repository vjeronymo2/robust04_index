			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / Turkey ready to set up more camps for Kurds TURKEY yesterday said it was ready to set up more camps for Kurdish refugees from Iraq, but stressed that they should be accompanied by additional camps on the Iraqi side of the border. As more Kurds streamed across the border, Turkish officials began moving 20,000 refugees down from the mountains to a site at Silopi, about 30 miles inside Turkey. Earlier, official policy was to confine refugees close to the border area. Silopi has tents supplied by the United Nations High Commission for Refugees and will have a 400-bed hospital. Most Kurdish refugees, however, will remain dependent on the international air drop. The promise of more camps came in London at a meeting between Mr John Major, Britain's prime minister, and Mr Yildirim Akbulut, his Turkish counterpart. According to Downing Street, Mr Akbulut said that Turkey had already established some camps down from the mountains, but stressed it had to be a reciprocal process. Mr Akbulut and Mr Major agreed that the only lasting solution was for the refugees to return home in safety, and Mr Major said he would encourage the UN towards this objective. The 45-minute meeting between Mr Major and Mr Akbulut, who was in London for the launch of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, was devoted to discussing the Kurds' plight. Mr Akbulut said there were now 400,000 refugees from Iraq in Turkey and the country was spending Pounds 1.5m a day on them. Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, outlined the latest UK contributions to the relief effort in a statement to the House of Commons. He told MPs that Britain would send another six Chinook helicopters to Turkey this week, bringing to nine the number of UK helicopters helping with the relief aid drop. Mr Hurd added that Mrs Lynda Chalker, the overseas development minister, would visit stricken border areas in Turkey and Iran later this week. International aid organisations based in Britain yesterday urged the British government to find a political solution to the plight of the 1.5m Kurds in the mountains along Iraq's borders with Turkey and Iran. Officials of eight agencies, including the Red Cross, Oxfam, Christian Aid and Save the Children Fund, said they had agreed with Mr Hurd and Ms Chalker on the importance of providing humanitarian aid to the Kurdish refugees immediately. However, the aid agencies could not carry out their task properly until there was a political solution providing the Kurdish refugees with 'demonstrable protection'. Refugees start to panic, Page 4 The Iranian government claimed yesterday that Iraqi troops had crossed the border on Sunday and were occupying an area three miles into Iran. In a protest note to the UN, Tehran demanded the immediate withdrawal of the Iraqis. Iraq hastily patched up its long border quarrel with Iran last August, when it faced massive US and allied opposition to its invasion of Kuwait. However, relations between the two countries have worsened recently. Page 4</p>

			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / A future in the balance: The death of President Kim Il-sung may herald far-reaching reforms in North Korea The sudden death of North Korean President Kim Il-sung has added a new element of instability to an already tense situation on the Korean peninsula caused by the dispute over Pyongyang's suspected nuclear weapons programme. Mr Kim personified the North Korean government for more than four decades. Such has been his dominance that outsiders can only guess at the consequences of his departure. It could trigger political unrest that might eventually lead to the collapse of the economically ailing North and its rapid and costly absorption by South Korea. Alternatively, his death may offer hope, for it could be the prelude to the introduction of Chinese-style economic reforms by a young generation of technocrats who have been held back by the heavy hand of Mr Kim. They want to promote special economic zones to attract foreign investment and create modern industrial facilities for North Korea. What happens will largely depend on the fortunes of Mr Kim Jong-il, the eldest son and designated successor to the late president. Although the younger Mr Kim has an unsavoury reputation in the west (see below), many Seoul-based analysts of North Korea believe that he has encouraged and protected a cadre of pragmatic technocrats who want to promote trade and business ties with the capitalist world. His support for reforms, they say, is based on self-preservation. Mr Kim realises that he needs to improve living standards if he is to gain support from a public suffering from food shortages, falling industrial production and a lack of oil and other energy resources. But Mr Kim Jong-il and the technocrats are distrusted by an older generation of party and army veterans who firmly support the doctrine of juche (self-reliance) created by his father. They fear that opening isolated North Korea to the outside world could cause political instability and undermine the authoritarian government as the public becomes exposed to capitalism and other foreign influences. Resistance to Mr Kim Jong-il is believed to be particularly strong in the military, whose leadership is closely aligned with conservatives in the government. A younger generation of Chinese-trained officers, however, is thought to harbour ambitions of spearheading a military-backed industrialisation programme, repeating the examples of the South Korean army after its coup in 1961 and the People's Liberation Army in China now. Mr Kim is consequently vulnerable to a coup attempt, particularly since he lacks the charisma that kept his father in power. He also faces potential opposition from members of his family in a modern version of the intrigue that used to plague the old Korean royal courts. The biggest challenge could come from his half-brother Mr Kim Pyong-il, who is supported by the president's widow, Ms Kim Song-ae, and possibly the late president's younger brother, Mr Kim Yong-ju. These family members are believed to have close links to the military. In the short term, however, Mr Kim Jong-il appears to have the upper hand. His appointment as head of the state funeral committee for his father is a clear indication that he will soon take over leadership of the ruling Korean Workers' Party and possibly the less powerful position of president. Since Mr Kim Il-sung unofficially designated him as his successor in the early 1970s, Mr Kim Jong-il has had two decades to build up organisational support for his leadership by placing loyalists in the party and government. His control over the military, however, is more problematic, in spite of his role as commander in chief of the armed forces. One reason is that party influence over the military has been less pervasive than in other organisations. Most analysts believe that Mr Kim Jong-il will have only two or three years to consolidate his support and impose his authority over the government, party and military if he is to avoid being overthrown. An early test of his influence will be the two crucial decisions he faces in the coming days: on whether to pursue talks with the US on nuclear inspections of the North's nuclear facilities; and on whether to proceed with an unprecedented summit with South Korean President Kim Young-sam. His father decided to reopen negotiations with the US and start them with South Korea shortly before he died - probably with a view to gaining diplomatic and economic concessions in return for renouncing the North's nuclear ambitions. The pragmatists in the government have urged such a policy to end the country's international isolation and save it from economic collapse, according to recent visitors to Pyongyang. But there are worries that Mr Kim Jong-il, lacking his father's immense authority, may adopt a hardline stance in a tactical move to win the support of his conservative opponents until he gains total power. This would increase chances of a confrontation with the US over the nuclear dispute and possibly of a conflict breaking out on the Korean peninsula. The delicate political balancing act that Mr Kim Jong-il faces is likely to limit the scope of any economic reforms that he may want to introduce in the immediate future. Moreover, he appears to lack the political skills and finesse that kept his father in power for 46 years. His need to build political alliances may eventually reduce Mr Kim to a figurehead or force him to share power in a collective leadership, which would considerably undermine his authority. Some believe that even if Mr Kim succeeds in imposing his rule, he will lack the courage to introduce reforms far-reaching enough to reverse the country's economic decline. He may fear that a significant opening up to foreign investment would begin to unravel the centralised political structure. 'The (investment) measures being discussed would only tinker with the system, but fail to solve its fundamental flaws. They would be equivalent to the Soviet Union's efforts in the 1970s to attract foreign investment, which had little impact,' said Mr Yang Sung-chul, professor of political science at Kyunghee university in Seoul. This would be a recipe for further economic stagnation. If the economy continues to shrink by 5 per cent a year as it has done for the last few years, it could spark a popular revolt that would provide a pretext for the army to impose military rule after ousting Mr Kim. Ironically, Mr Kim's strongest support may come from North Korea's arch-enemies, South Korea and the US. Seoul is worried that a sudden collapse of North Korea would cripple its efforts to become an advanced industrial nation, by forcing it to divert resources to reconstruct the North. According to some estimates, this could cost as much as Dollars 200-Dollars 300bn (Pounds 133bn-Pounds 200bn) over 10 years. South Korean officials indicated yesterday that they might agree to ease restrictions on economic assistance and business ties to the North in force as a result of the nuclear dispute. They suggested that the US could do the same, with a view to maintaining political stability. Unlikely as it may seem for the industrial democracies to seize on Mr Kim Jong-il as a saviour of North Korea, Washington and Seoul may be praying that he succeeds in achieving a smooth transfer of power. The alternative would be a political upheaval whose effects would be felt throughout north-east Asia.  ----------------------------------------------------------------- ECONOMIC INDICATORS           1989    1990    1991    1992    1993  ----------------------------------------------------------------- Real GNP growth (%)            2.0    -3.7    -5.2    -5.0     n/a Population (m)                  21    21.4    21.8    22.2    22.6 Exports (Dollars bn)          1.69    1.86    1.40    0.92     n/a Imports (Dollars bn)          2.90    2.93    2.31    1.55     n/a Trade deficit (Dollars bn)   1.219   1.073   0.902   0.630     n/a  ----------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Economist Intelligence Unit  -----------------------------------------------------------------</p>

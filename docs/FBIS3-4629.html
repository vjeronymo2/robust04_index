			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] The Palestine Liberation Organization is  recalling all its negotiators with Israel and Egypt, Paris, and  Washington. The PLO leadership decided on this during a meeting  in Tunis. The move follows the Hebron mass massacre by a Jewish  settler, who killed over 50 people. [passage omitted]    Singapore has condemned the massacre. The Foreign Ministry  called on Israel to immediately impose security measures to  protect the population of West Bank from such criminal act by  extremists. Singapore also adds that Israel and the PLO should  not allow the act of violence to derail the Middle East peace  process. Less fights would speed up progress at the peace  talks. The spokesman said this is the best way to prevent more  killings and the acts of revenge, which would only further  inflame emotion and delay and complicate the peace negotiations.</p>

			<p><P> March 29, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> 'EVERYBODY KNEW HIM';  </P> <P> STUNNED CROWD OF 1,600 BIDS GOODBY TO SLAIN TEACHER  </P> <P> More than 1,600 people joined in an emotional memorial service Tuesday in North  Hollywood to honor a longtime Grant High School teacher and senior class  adviser who was slain in front of his home last week.  </P> <P> Present and past Grant students, many of them friends who had not seen each  other in years, attended the service at Temple Beth Hillel, embracing and  exchanging stories about Hal Arthur, who had taught history and government at  the Van Nuys school since 1961.  </P> <P> "Immeasurable is the hurt, and immense, immense is the loss," Rabbi James  Kaufman said during the service. He said Arthur was the man who in the early  1960s first encouraged him to become a rabbi.  </P> <P> Police said Tuesday that they still had no suspect or motive in the slaying of  Arthur, 60, who was gunned down Friday morning while leaving his Sherman Oaks  home for school.  </P> <P> Arthur's longtime friend and colleague, Harlan Barbanell, said students of the  slain teacher can be found on "every street in this part of the San Fernando  Valley."  </P> <P> Grant's 1968 prom queen, Melinda Diner, said she recently had dinner with  Arthur at a local restaurant "and, my God, people were coming up saying, 'Do  you remember me, Mr. Arthur?' Everybody knew him. He was like an Ozzie and  Harriet kind of counselor."  </P> <P> In a hourlong series of eulogies by friends and relatives, Arthur was described  as an energetic man; a lover of travel, good food and good drink; someone  passionate about his profession who cared about his students. People filled  every seat at the temple and stood in the aisles and doorways. Many cried. One  boy fainted during the service.  </P> <P> "He was the prototype of the good, caring teacher," said Wayne Johnson,  president of United Teachers-Los Angeles, the district's teachers union. Also  attending were Los Angeles school Supt. Leonard Britton and school board  President Roberta Weintraub, who represents the East Valley.  </P> <P> Andrew Plotkin, Grant's senior class president in 1987, said he grew close to  Arthur while traveling with him and 30 students during one of the summer trips  to Europe that Arthur organized.  </P> <P> "Some of the best times I've ever had were with him in Europe, drinking  together in bars and talking like friends," Plotkin said.  </P> <P> Plotkin and others interviewed at the service said they still cannot imagine  who would want to harm Arthur. Those who knew the teacher said they are still  in shock.  </P> <P> Michael Tolan, Arthur's cousin, said during the service that the killing is  another example of the need for stricter gun control laws. "There's not enough  anger being expressed here," he said.  </P> <P> Arthur is survived by his wife, Virginia, and three sons, Jason, Michael and  Jeffery.  </P> <P> Senior class officers at Grant have scheduled a memorial service for Arthur at  the school at 1 p.m. Thursday. They have also started a Hal Arthur Memorial  Fund.  </P></p>

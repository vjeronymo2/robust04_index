			<p>940228 FT  28 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor (1): Swiss ban not so remarkable Sir, It is not at all remarkable that the Swiss should vote to ban foreign trucks ('EU up in arms over Alpine truck ban', February 22). If you sought the opinion of the British on any aspect of UK transport policy, from restricting traffic in towns to the government's Pounds 23bn road building programme, you would encounter similar sentiments. What is remarkable is that the Swiss government, which campaigned against the ban, actually paid attention to what its people want. Maurice Geller, 10a Sudbrooke Road, London SW12 8TG</p>

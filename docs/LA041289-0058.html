			<p><P> April 12, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOMBS DAMAGE 2 BOOKSTORES; LINK TO RUSHDIE SEEN  </P> <P> Firebombs damaged two bookstores in attacks that may be connected with the  controversy over Salman Rushdie's novel "The Satanic Verses," Scotland Yard  announced Tuesday.  </P> <P> A Scotland Yard spokesman said police discovered a fire and a broken window at  Dillon's University Bookshop in London's West End late Sunday.  </P> <P> Another fire began at Collett's Bookshop on Charing Cross Road about one minute  later, shortly after a witness saw two men in the shop doorway.  </P> <P> "The shop is very badly damaged . . . ," said Monica Wanninger, store manager  of Collett's, which sells exclusively the books of Rushdie's publisher, Viking  Penguin. "We'll be shut for six to eight weeks."  </P> <P> Rushdie has been in hiding under police guard since the Ayatollah Ruhollah  Khomeini, Iran's revolutionary leader, said Feb. 14 that he should be killed  because his novel has blasphemed the Prophet Mohammed.  </P></p>

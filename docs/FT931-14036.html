			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / The Clinton Inauguration: The activist generation awaits rallying call - President's inaugural address must awaken a nationwide commitment to make America a better place AN inauguration is the ultimate American political rite of passage, intended to set the tone for the presidency to come. Sometimes it does, sometimes it does not. The most memorable inaugural addresses are the stuff of history. George Washington's first was held in New York and still holds the record for brevity - 143 words. William Henry Harrison's in 1841 was the longest at 105 minutes. He caught pneumonia in the freezing cold and died just over a month later. Although selections are invidious, four addresses are generally accorded a special place. Abraham Lincoln's in 1861, delivered to a nation in civil war, was perhaps the finest exercise in inaugural oratory, exceeded only marginally by his Gettysburg speech four years later. President-elect Bill Clinton had no trouble quoting Mr Lincoln on Sunday night when he called on the 'better angels of our nature' to guide his presidency. Franklin Delano Roosevelt's stirring commitment in 1933 to drag the country out of the Depression was captured on nationwide radio and newsreel and offered hope amid desolation. 'This nation asks for action and action now. . . we must act and act quickly,' might not have a Lincolnesque ring but the words were precisely what was wanted. John Kennedy's generational call to arms - 'ask not what your country can do for you but what you can do for your country' - held out similar promise, although, unlike FDR's, it was not fulfilled in his brief term. In 1981 Ronald Reagan switched the site of the inaugural address to the west-facing steps of the Capitol, a neat symbol for a Californian. He then declared that government had grown too big and would be cut down to size. His administration proceeded to do what he had pledged. His second inaugural was also prescient. It was held indoors because of the ferocious cold and, although his second four years can be said to have presaged the end of the cold war, they were also marked for some dubious policies (such as Iran-Contra) that were never designed to see the light of day. Promise, however, often falls short. It was, after all, President Kennedy who started the long, slippery slide into the Vietnam war and the death of 57,000 young Americans, a disproportionate number black. This, presumably, was not the fate he had in mind when he asked them to 'bear any burden' so that liberty might prevail. In 1977 Jimmy Carter charmed the country with a thoughtful speech about the inter-dependent world and by becoming the first to walk the length of Pennsylvania Avenue hand in hand with his wife. Four years later, his reflections seen as indecisive and the millstone of the hostages in Iran round his neck, he was gone. George Bush in 1989 said he would transform the Reagan legacy into 'a kinder, gentler America' and a lot of people thought he had struck just the right note. Today he goes back to Texas as a private citizen because his countrymen concluded he had no idea how to make it so. It is traditional now that every inaugural speech has grace notes, such as Mr Carter complimenting Gerald Ford for all he had done to 'heal our country' and Mr Reagan, less probably, being equally generous to Mr Carter. Mr Clinton will have nice things to say about George Bush, because it is now accepted and because he is a good charitable Christian. It was not always thus: John Adams refused to attend Thomas Jefferson's inaugural (the election had been determined, perhaps by connivance, in the House of Representatives) while Herbert Hoover could barely bring himself to look at FDR as they rode to the Capitol together. Mr Clinton, who is a keen student of past presidents, has adopted a quintessentially eclectic approach to his inaugural. This ranges from the Jeffersonian ride from Monticello, through the extravaganza that marked the advent of Kennedy and the populist themes so dear to Carter, to tomorrow's open day at the White House. This, however, will be by invitation only, perhaps because Mr Clinton delved into what happened when Andrew Jackson opened the White House up to his friends in 1829. They muddied the carpets and broke the furniture and Jackson had to escape through a back window. Mr Clinton will also strive for a distinctive note. He may not be the youngest president, a honour belonging to Teddy Roosevelt, but, even more than Kennedy, he is the representative of a different and younger generation. This is a generation born after the last world war and not tempered much, Vietnam apart, by conflict. For many, opposition to that war was the common denominator. But in an age deprived of the overweening cold war, yet consumed by so many independent flashpoints, the 'old' qualifications, including military service, are no longer deemed pre-eminent. Many Americans of his age, though fired by the social and political activism of the 1960s, subsequently dropped out or got law degrees, became affluent and are now universally known as 'baby boomers' and 'yuppies'. But Mr Clinton, though a lawyer, stayed in government and pushed for change. His inaugural, like the better parts of his campaign, must be designed to reawaken that activist commitment to make the nation a better place, now stirring after a long sleep. The metaphors he chooses will be unwrapped today, the promises offered to a hungry nation. There will be for a while a positive national desire for him to succeed. The tough part, as ever, is preserving that goodwill when the fires of the inauguration are but embers.</p>

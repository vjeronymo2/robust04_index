			<p>910415 FT  15 APR 91 / Justinian: Defence case for taking silk There was more than the ordinary amount of jollity around the Temple this year over the list of the new Queen's Counsel. Everyone cheered the appointment of the first black woman at the professionally youthful age of 35. Ethnic minorities and equal opportunists hailed the lord chancellor's decision as a sensitive response to contemporary social demands. The profession as a whole found the inclusion of more women in the list and the establishment of a separate class of honorary QCs (the artificial silks, such as academics, lawyers, civil servants and solicitors) not unwelcome. Until now, the Bar has reluctantly accepted social change. It has not, for example, welcomed - let alone encouraged - women practitioners. Female barristers were quaintly, if widely, believed to be over-emotional; it was thought that in order to succeed they had to suppress feminine attitudes. In a memorandum to the Monopolies Commission in 1969 the Bar Council said: 'The fact has to be faced that the profession of barrister requires the masculine approach (however fallacious it may be) to reasoning and argument, and women only succeed in such activities if they have a masculine disposition.' Happily, one cannot imagine that being said today. Given that the gender hurdle has now been successfully negotiated, what public benefit is there in conferring an accolade each year on approximately three score and ten advocates? The function of Queen's Counsel is to maintain a cadre of leading practitioners - roughly 10 per cent of the 6,000 practising barristers - to provide a more expert service than the general run of barristers can offer. Queen's Counsel advise or appear as advocates in the bigger or heavier court cases. They discard the routine work of drawing up pleadings in litigation. Their paperwork decreases, but their responsibility for the conduct of cases in the courtroom increases. They are the luminaries of the profession as a result of proven professional ability and forensic quality. Queen's Counsel become the chief exponents of legal argument in the high courts of the land. As such, they attract more readily the tired old myth that a lawyer's argument is of no value because he is paid to deliver it (and, as a QC, more highly paid than his stuffed-gown junior colleague). Dr Johnson had the answer to that quip: unlike testimony, which you might disregard, he said, argument is argument, and you cannot help paying regard to arguments if they are good. Dr Johnson relied on a piece of Baconian imagery. Francis Bacon said: 'Testimony is like an arrow shot from a long bow; the force of it depends on the strength of the hand that draws it. Argument is like an arrow from a cross-bow, which has equal force, though shot by a child.' There is an argument - good enough to demand attention - that 'taking silk' (becoming a QC) is an anachronism. The quality of professional services cannot depend upon whether the practitioner is entitled to put QC (or KC in times of a male sovereign) after his or her name. In fact, the initials may even deceive the consumer if the lawyer's skills are not up to the standard implicitly promised by the letters patent. Solicitors who instruct counsel are, of course, not so readily deceived. Some of those who apply to the lord chancellor do so less with a view to practising in the front row of the courtroom than to obtaining a passport either to judicial office (usually as a circuit judge) or to some other remunerative occupation outside private legal practice. Successive lord chancellors have attempted to prevent the system being used this way. They do not always succeed. Some new Queen's Counsel do not make the transition sufficiently well to ensure an adequate income, and fall by the wayside. This is less a problem now than it was in the past. Until the 1970s, many junior counsels did not apply to join the ranks of their seniors for fear that their level of earnings might not be sustained; others felt happier in a less exalted role. In recent years, however, most barristers have seen the taking of silk as the pinnacle of a professional career - short of elevation to the bench. Every year, the number of applications exceeds the number of those who are awarded their letters patent: roughly one in five are preferred. Only a handful - the high-flyers in the profession - succeed the first time. Many have to wait three, four, or even more years before achieving their ambition. Every year, unsuccessful applications cause much perturbation and worry. The system has led one or two notable barristers to leave the Bar, rather than be subjected to the indignity of seeing their peers promoted while they are left behind. Is there a case for abolishing the highly-competitive element in the system? In other Anglo-Saxon jurisdictions which have taken over the system of having senior counsel, a different and healthier process applies. When a practitioner at the Bar feels that he or she is ready to take the decisive step, permission is sought from the leader of the practising profession to apply to the relevant minister or chief justice (the equivalent of the lord chancellor). Once that permission is granted, the applicant almost automatically is made a Queen's Counsel, subject only to a veto held in reserve for cases of known impropriety. The application is made singly at any time, thus avoiding the annual race. The distinction is conferred without the fuss and bother of a ceremony. The tradition of Her Majesty's Counsel learned in the law - the precise words of the letters patent - is worth preserving merely as an honour conferred on successful practitioners within the profession. To give it greater meaning is to endanger any public benefit associated with the honour.</p>

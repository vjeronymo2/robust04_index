			<p><P> May 24, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO INDUSTRY NOTES  </P> <P> Cipher Data Products said Tuesday that it will be only "marginally profitable"  on lower-than-anticipated revenues for the fourth quarter to end June 30.  </P> <P> In a prepared statement, Cipher Data Chairman Gary Liebl said his company's  revenue for the current quarter will come in at "closer to $60 million" than  the $70 million that some analysts had pegged for the manufacturer of computer  tape drives.  </P> <P> Profit for the three months apparently will be less than the $5.1 million  Cipher reported for last year's fourth quarter, when sales totaled $55.9  million. The quarter's results will include revenue from the Irwin tape drive  line acquired last month.  </P> <P> Liebl blamed a slowdown in demand "in recent weeks" for its half-inch,  reel-to-reel tape drives as well as for 5.25-inch tape drives, both of which  are used as backup data storage devices in computer systems.  </P> <P> Cipher Data Products released the statement after the stock market had closed  Tuesday.  </P> <P> In over-the-counter trading, Cipher stock closed down $.125 at $9.375 a share.  </P></p>

			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / Arts: The Russians bring drama to Paris Russia's first big season in Paris was in 1909, with Diaghilev's Ballet Russe. Now, Theatre De L' Europe Odeon in Paris has decided to revive the tradition. It has announced a Russian season, this time of drama, and invited two directors - Lev Dodin, the well-known artistic director of the famous Maly Theatre from Petersburg; and the completely unknown 25-year-old Ivan Popovskii, director of the new Studio of Petr Fomenko. 'This was a huge risk', says the Odeon's director, Borja Sitja, 'but we wanted to give a chance to a young Russian company'. For the young Russian company, however, touring in the west is not just a chance to show their work to the world, but also the only way to survive economically; Lev Dodin's company, for example, spends more time abroad than in Russia - prompting the Russian critic Anatoly Smelyanskii to remark: 'It will soon be necessary to set up a Russian season in Moscow, not in Paris'. But the young actors of Fomenko Studio realise the primary importance of their work in Russia. For the Russian season in Paris, Ivan Popovskii did not just chose a 'typically Russian play' but one which interested him artistically: Aleksandr Blok's The Show-Booth, or Baraque de Foire, which is little-known in the west and rarely done in Russia. Written in 1906 and originally not intended for theatre, this 'lyric drama', as Blok called it, was produced the same year by the great Vsevolod Meyerkhold and was seen as a sign of a new century. In this symbolistic drama, mysticism and death are confronted with the life-enhancing theatre element in the form of commedia del' arte characters. Pierrot, Colombina and Harlequino break through the boundaries of their stories and start living lives of their own. Death turns into Colombina; masks conceal facelessness; Harlequino breaks through the window made out of paper and the whole world turns out to be just a dream. Ivan Popovskii's production lacks any tragic atmosphere. This young director is not in the least interested in linking his work to the modern history; his imagination is occupied with theatrical effects. Although not the most deep, it is certainly one of the most beautiful productions done by a Russian company in recent years. The scenery, designed by Vladimir Maximov, plays a role of its own. The production turns into a series of beautiful pictures, full of breathtaking, almost cinematographical, effects. In the last scene all the characters walk out through the white walls of an irregularly shaped room, made out of paper, leaving man-size dark holes. The wind makes the scraps of paper tremble and a draught brings into the room a strange woman in black who goes through the lighted aisle of the auditorium and disappears in darkness. This strange, almost shadow-like, dark figure comes from another play by Blok, The Unknown, or L' Inconnue, a play about vulgarity, a poet and his illusions. Here Popovskii has given the poet the opportunity to meet his double from Show-Booth - Pierrot. These two romantics, one in black, the other in white, go through the series of Popovskii's tableaux like two Picasso figures, never looking at each other but as if connected by an invisible string. Popovskii's production reminds one that besides everything else, theatre can be beautiful and rich in its visual effects. The main problem of this production in Paris, however, is that the lighting, scenery and sound effects take the priority and leave little space to actors and the author. Popovskii gets carried away by theatre facilities that are not available in Russia. Like someone who has not eaten properly for a long time, he falls upon the cakes and forgets about the meat. The Show-Booth tours France next year.</p>

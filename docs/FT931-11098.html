			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / Technology: Fast-talking computer shows its strength - A powerful translation system Language barriers are set to tumble with the advent of powerful technology which allows messages to be sent between personal computers anywhere in the world and instantly translated en route. European scientists have harnessed the power of parallel processing, where up to 256 computers can work alongside each other, to achieve previously unheard-of speed and accuracy of translation. The method is so quick that 200 pages of text in most languages can be translated in 20 minutes  - a task which previously took eight hours on the best systems. Experts predict that better programming will make it even faster. For brief messages sent electronically around the world, the operation is almost instantaneous. Even complex documents only take a few minutes to translate. The work, being carried out by Bull of France, Siemens of Germany, and ICL of the UK, is part of an EC research programme known as Esprit. It is at the test stage, but products could be on the market by 1994-95. By scanning print directly into the computer, the system will operate at half the cost of a human translator and 35 per cent quicker, believes Bill O'Riordan, ICL's manager of research and advanced technology. Accuracy has been a problem in the past because of the complexity of the task  - colloquialisms, cultural differences and context are just some of the elements that must be taken into account. 'The Archbishop is ready for dinner,' for instance, gives no clues as to whether he is waiting for his evening meal or has been captured by hungry cannibals. People are still needed to edit the results, but parallel processing has enabled far more sophisticated programming, says O'Riordan, taking computers well beyond clumsy word-for-word translation. 'I tried to trick it with 'I think a thought'. The computer analysed this and came back with 'I think of an idea'.' O'Riordan believes the greatest demand will be for manuals and technical papers, especially from manufacturing industry which is expected to account for more than 55 per cent of computer translation in the next few years. Professional translators have yet to discover the benefits of the new technology: 'At the moment we don't use machine translation because it takes too long to correct the mistakes  - it is still quicker if we do it ourselves,' says Emma Wagner, head of the EC's English translation unit in Luxembourg. Jane Mountford of the Institute of Translation and Interpreting in London still feels there is no substitute for the traditional approach. 'Computers will not replace human translators. They are a tool and if they take some of the hard graft out of our work they will be welcome,' she says. EC translators currently use a vast multilingual computer dictionary called Eurodicatum, and many sectors of industry also rely on technical language databases to aid translation of specialist papers. One of the largest is a medical dictionary with 230,000 terms in Japanese and 180,000 in English. Bob Kowalski, a professor at Imperial College London, has succeeded in disentangling the jargon from a parliamentary paper  - the British Nationalities Act. The result is straightforward, logical language that is legally accurate, and comprehensible to both computers and the person in the street. The next few years will see science fiction become fact. O'Riordan predicts that computers will soon cross the ultimate barrier by translating speech, with simultaneous interpreting at conferences achieved within just five years.</p>

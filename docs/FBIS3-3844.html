In his speech, Jiang Chunyun, member of the Political Bureau  of the CPC Central Committee and secretary of the Shandong  provincial party committee, expressed heartfelt gratitude, on  behalf of the provincial party committee and government, to the  friends from Hong Kong and Macao for their many years of great  support to the promotion of the economies of Hong Kong, Macao,  and Shandong and to Shandong's modernization drive. He said:  Over the past decade and more since reform and opening up  started, Shandong has continuously emancipated the mind,  deepened reform, opened wider to the outside world, and  accelerated development thanks to the guidance of Deng  Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics and the CPC's basic line, principles, and  policies. It has created an excellent situation characterized  by rapid economic development and social stability and unity.  Meanwhile, we have remained clear- headed to note that Shandong  is still lagging rather far behind the requirements of the party  Central Committee and other provinces and municipalities in  southern China in its extent of opening up and pace of  development. It is hoped that friends from Hong Kong and Macao  will continue their concern and support for Shandong and offer  more valuable opinions on Shandong's future work.    Zhao Zhihao, deputy secretary of the provincial party  committee and governor of Shandong, introduced to the friends  from Hong Kong and Macao the basic situation of Shandong, its  economic and social development in the past few years, its ideas  for the development and work for some time to come, and the key  areas of foreign investment for the near future and relevant  policies. He said: Introducing more investment from abroad is  the focus of Shandong's endeavor to open to the outside world  more rapidly. To introduce investment from abroad more rapidly,  we will greatly optimize the investment climate, simplify work  procedures, improve the later-stage management of  foreign-invested enterprises, and provide good-quality and  high-efficient service to the foreign firms who have come to  invest in Shandong.    He emphasized: We wholeheartedly welcome the friends and  relatives from Hong Kong and Macao to come to Shandong more  often to visit, inspect, and give guidance and wholeheartedly  hoped that, in the future, they will, as always, show concern  for and support Shandong's modernization drive and, together  with us, open up a still better future in the economic and trade  cooperation between Shandong Province and Hong Kong and Macao.    Thirty-seven deputies and members attended the meeting,  including Henry Fok Ying-tung, vice chairman of the National  CPPCC Committee and president of the China Chamber of Commerce  of Hong Kong. In their speeches, they held unanimously:  Shandong is an important coastal open province, which has  abundant resources and preferential policies for opening up, and  whose people are loyal to friends and as good as their word.  They said that they would visit Shandong more often to learn  more about it and develop economic and trade cooperation. They  believed that Shandong's economic and trade cooperation and  exchanges with Hong Kong and Macao would be further developed.    Li Zhen, chairman of the provincial people's congress  standing committee; Lu Maozeng, chairman of the provincial CPPCC  committee; Song Fatang, standing committee member of the  provincial party committee and vice governor of Shandong; and  persons in charge from pertinent provincial departments, were  present at the meeting.</p>

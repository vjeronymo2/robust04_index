			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / Capital Spending (6): Smooth progress to the top of his trade - Alice Rawsthorn and Ian Rodger profile five of the leading lights in the high-profile world of luxury goods / Naim Attallah THE FIRST time that Naim Attallah walked into Asprey of Bond Street was back in 1971 when he went there to buy a carriage clock for his wife. He fell into conversation with the shop assistant, a young man named John Asprey, who persuaded his father to offer Attallah a job. Attallah, 61, is now the chief executive of the Asprey group. He is best known as the indulgent owner of the Literary Review and of Quartet Books and as a publisher with a penchant for employing blue-blooded gels. Yet he has been involved with Asprey since the early 1970s, initially as a consultant and latterly as the architect of its expansion from the original Bond Street gift shop into a fully-fledged luxury goods group. Asprey today includes a string of prestigious businesses, from Mappin &amp; Webb, the silversmith; to Garrard, the crown jeweller; Watches of Switzerland, the watch shops; and a stake in Tomasz Starzewski, designer darling of London's ladies-who-lunch. Naim Attallah still prefers to see himself as a patron of the arts, rather than a businessman, but seems to revel in his role at Asprey. His new responsibilities seem to have done nothing to diminish his enthusiastic manner, nor to cramp his style. He still appears at his office each morning in his customary uniform of odd socks, knuckle-dusting rings, a (very expensive) watch on each wrist and a psychedelic silk tie. A quick glance at Asprey's accounts justifies his joie de vivre. Asprey of Bond Street has always concentrated on the very top of the luxury market by becoming the gift shop for the fabulously wealthy Asian industrialists and Arab aristocrats. Asprey has been sheltered from the problems that have beset its competitors for years and Naim Attallah, reluctant businessman though he may be, has done deal after deal to take it into yet more areas of the luxury goods business.</p>

			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / International Company News: AT&amp;T takes Dollars 7bn charge AT&amp;T, the US communications and computer group, announced yesterday that it will take a Dollars 7bn charge in the first quarter of this year to comply with a new standard of accounting for the post-retirement health benefits of employees. The size of the charge was at the high end of the company's own forecast, which had originally put the post-tax liability of the accounting change at between Dollars 5.5bn and Dollars 7.5bn. In the wake of yesterday's announcement AT&amp;T's share price fell Dollars 1 1/4 to close at Dollars 52 5/8 in a broadly weaker stock market. AT&amp;T said that the accounting change would have no effect on its present and future retirement health benefits, nor would it affect the company's cash flow, its long-term earnings objectives or its ability to pay for dividends, research and development and capital expansion programmes.</p>

			<p><P> July 14, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> CONTINUANCE URGED FOR WELFARE FUNDS  </P> <P> Frustrated by the budget stalemate in Sacramento, Supervisor Don R. Roth wrote  a letter to Gov. George Deukmejian asking for his help in bringing about an  agreement that will guarantee a continued flow of money to Orange County's  welfare recipients.  </P> <P> In a letter written Thursday, Roth said the budget standoff means that $37.1  million in state funds intended for Orange County for the month of July are  being withheld, including $19.1 million to cover local welfare checks.  </P> <P> The state Senate approved a $52-billion-plus budget Tuesday, but its tax and  fee increases set it up for likely defeat in the Assembly.  </P> <P> Members of a joint Senate-Assembly budget committee took up the measure Friday,  but by afternoon they were divided and talks had stalled.  </P> <P> Roth said the county's proposed budget includes provisions to continue funding  for critical programs for a while.  </P> <P> But he complained that the county is pinched unfairly in a state budget impasse  because it is required to operate entitlement programs without state funds.  </P> <P> "This current situation simply highlights the lack of state concern in  underfunding its mandates and withholding what limited funding is required to  support the entitlement programs," Roth wrote.  </P> <P> He said he is particularly concerned because of the increasing conflict between  growing program demands and the decrease in state funding.  </P> <P> "I believe the state budgeting system must address the appropriate and timely  funding of the programs which it requires the County of Orange to operate,"  Roth said.  </P> <P> Roth suggested that the state could solve the problem by adopting a budget  provision to ensure continuation of a current year's aid into the next fiscal  year if necessary, or by establishing a special trust fund to cover such aid if  lawmakers must debate the budget into the next fiscal year.  </P> <P> He also suggested that legislators draft a budget that includes July payments  in the prior fiscal year's budget so that all mandated programs are covered  while the new budget is debated.

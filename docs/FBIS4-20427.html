			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Kun Shan [2492 1472]: ``Zhengzhou-Xian Fiber </F> Optic Cable Trunk Line Completed'']    [Summary] The 50-million-yuan Zhengzhou-Xian fiber optic  cable communications trunk line construction project was  recently completed, with inter-district circuits already in  trial operation. This 558-km-long trunk line, a critical segment  of the Asia-Europe overland fiber optic cable, uses imported  single-mode long-wavelength optical fiber and fiber optic cable  throughout. The initial phase has four fiber optic cable digital  transmission systems employing 1310-nm-wavelength fiber with a  140 Mbps [i.e., DS4] transmission rate.</p>

			<p>920829 FT  29 AUG 92 / Markets: Blue Chips make investors see red - Serious Money MOST shareholders do not want miracles. They do not expect to buy the kind of share that doubles overnight or turns Pounds 1,000 into Pounds 100,000 over a decade. Many simply would like to buy a share in a good, solid company and lock it away for several years while enjoying steady capital and dividend growth. But recent corporate news has highlighted how difficult it is to rely on companies that most would classify as 'blue chip.' Take BP, which recently halved its second-quarter dividend. If an investor had bought BP shares five years ago, he would now be sitting on a 50 per cent loss. There are plenty of other blue chip names where investors are looking at hefty losses over a five-year period - ICI is down 31 per cent, Land Securities 32 per cent, P&amp;O 52 per cent and Pilkington 73 per cent. Admittedly, those figures cover a period that began at the peak of the bull market in 1987. Nevertheless, most investors in those companies would expect to have seen some sort of gain over as long as five years. After all, the FT-SE 100 index has risen 2.9 per cent over the same period. Perhaps the answer is that investors simply cannot lock their shares in a drawer and forget about them for 10 years. 'It is a salutory lesson to all of us that you can never leave your equities alone,' says Paul Killik, of broker Killik &amp; Co. 'If you look back at the constituents of the FT-30 index 20 or 30 years ago, you find names that don't exist today.' Simon Sharp, of stockbroker Albert E. Sharp adds: 'We do not think there is a permanent investment for our discretionary accounts. Circumstances can change so much.' Brian Tora, of Greig Middleton, notes: 'Locking shares away and forgetting them is less easy to do in today's volatile markets.' Tora says that one important problem is how market-makers can mark down prices without any selling activity. The result is that shares move so sharply on bad news that private investors cannot possibly react in time. So, should the private investor despair? According to the experts, there may still be some companies which can be bought as core holdings. Killik points out: 'We do have a sector of the market that doesn't guarantee massive rates of growth but does offer security - the utilities. And, as a result, they have massively outperformed.' Indeed, the FT-A Water index is up 32 per cent since the start of April. People will always use water, electricity and the telephone, so the theory goes; thus, the shares of such companies are safer bets. 'With utilities, the future is more predictable' says Tora. 'The main thing you have to do is second-guess how the regulator will treat the industry.' The recent strength of the utilities' shares could have diminished the future rewards, though. From averaging 1.6 times the yield on the All-Share at the start of 1990, the water sector now offers a yield only 1.1 times the market return. Killik says there may be other companies which still can be relied upon. 'Nothing is guaranteed,' he warns, 'but there are companies which seem to have an in-bred management culture and which are not acquisition-driven - companies such as Marks &amp; Spencer and Unilever.' The experiences of the last few years, however, may have persuaded many investors that there are no longer any such things as blue chips. For them, one answer might be the big international investment trusts. Their share prices may rise and fall with world stock markets but they normally contrive to provide more reliable income streams. Foreign &amp; Colonial, for example, recently announced its 21st consecutive annual dividend increase. Nevertheless, there can be a vast difference in their relative performances. Over five years, the best international trust (Law Debenture) is up 45 per cent while the worst (SPRAIT) is down 19.6 per cent. An obvious alternative to this uncertainty is a tracker fund. These attempt to match the performance of a chosen index and buy and sell shares only to make sure they reflect changes in the index. Transaction costs are reduced, and the investor knows that his holding will keep up with the market. City folk are rather sniffy about tracker funds, saying that a good manager should be able to beat the market, not just match it. Of course, they would say that since, if tracker funds become successful, many fund managers will be out of a job. But the evidence so far is that tracker funds have done far better than average. The James Capel and Gartmore UK index funds each shows a 1 per cent rise over the two years to August 1. That places them 16th equal out of 96 funds in the UK general sector. Admittedly, the tracker funds have hardly made their investors rich. But they seem to have met their objective - the All-Share index fell 0.7 per cent over the same period. The funds have 'beaten' the index only because the change in the All-Share does not include any dividend income. So, with blue chips hard to find and few fund managers able to beat the index, the arguments in favour of tracker funds are stronger than ever. They could just be the kind of reliable investment you can leave in the attic for the next 20 years.</p>

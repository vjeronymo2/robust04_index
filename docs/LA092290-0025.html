			<p><P> September 22, 1990, Saturday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> ILLINOIS HIGH COURT DECLARES WINNER IN MARCH GOP PRIMARY  </P> <P> The Illinois Supreme Court on Friday declared seven-term state Rep. Penny  Pullen the winner in her long-contested GOP primary race against a woman who  challenged her anti-abortion stance.  </P> <P> The state's highest court ruled that Pullen, one of the strongest abortion foes  in the General Assembly, won the March primary by six votes over Rosemary  Mulligan, a Des Plaines paralegal.  </P> <P> A lower court had found that the two women had tied and mandated a coin toss to  determine the winner. When Mulligan won, Pullen's forces appealed to the  state's highest court.  </P></p>

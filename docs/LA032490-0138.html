			<p><P> March 24, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH;  </P> <P> GIRLS' DRILL TEAM EARNS TRIP TO JAPAN  </P> <P> The Huntington Beach High School girls' drill team has wowed judges at  competitions during the past six months, including an outing last week that has  earned it a ticket to take the show overseas this summer.  </P> <P> The 43-member squad will perform today in the USA Nationals at Cypress College.  </P> <P> It will be the team's first appearance since winning the large drill team  division title at last Saturday's prestigious Miss Drill Team USA. That victory  earned the division's national championship and a berth, along with teams from  17 other high schools across the country, in the international finals to be  held in August in Japan.  </P> <P> It marks the first invitation the school has ever received to the international  competition. The 1984-85 team won the Miss Drill Team USA title but that was a  year before the worldwide finals were instituted.  </P> <P> This year's squad has placed first in the large military division of each of  its six competitions during 1989-90. If the squad wins today and again at its  final event next month, it will complete its first season without a loss since  the championship squad of five years ago.  </P> <P> The key to this team's success, said first-year coach Linda Stewart, has been  the girls' discipline. The girls practice as a full squad three hours per  night, five nights a week, in addition to five extra hours' minimum they are  required to work in their smaller groups, she said.  </P> <P> Much of the squad's time the next four months will be devoted to raising money  for the Japan trip, which will cost $900 per person, she said. The team has  held several fund-raisers already this year, and earlier this week Stewart  formally requested a grant from the city. City officials have yet to respond to  the request.

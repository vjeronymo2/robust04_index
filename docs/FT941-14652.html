			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / International Company News: JAL to cut investment and lose 5,000 jobs Japan Airlines, Japan's largest airline which is struggling to return to profitability, is reducing its workforce by about 5,000 people over four years and slashing investment in the period to about half of what it had planned. JAL said yesterday it was presenting its unions with a plan to reduce its workforce of almost 22,000 people to 17,000 by the end of fiscal 1997 through voluntary retirement, curtailment of new hirings and transfers to subsidiaries. The airline, which last year reported a Y54.9bn (Dollars 508m) pre-tax loss, will cut capital expenditure to Y440bn from a planned Y840bn in the next four years. JAL aims to cut a further Y100bn out of costs in the next fiscal year. Wages, limited to a 1 per cent increase last year, could be frozen this year and JAL may not hire new stewardesses for the second year running. The measures, to be implemented under a four-year restructuring plan, are aimed at ensuring the company's survival amid a difficult market environment. JAL has been hurt by a downturn in business and first-class travel as a result of Japan's economic slowdown, increased competition on international routes, particularly from lower-cost US airlines and a high-cost structure. The move was welcomed on the Tokyo stock market where JAL's share price rose Y10 on the news to close at Y640. Cuts in capital spending will range across all areas from aircraft to investment in facilities at the New Kansai International Airport scheduled to open in September. Orders for aircraft have been rescheduled so that JAL will be taking delivery of 28 aircraft, six fewer than planned. JAL will order smaller aircraft to raise its share of the domestic market. The company's union representing cabin crew criticised the moves: 'We cannot accept their plan' which makes employees pay for management failures.</p>

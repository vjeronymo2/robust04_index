			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Herb Stanschus: "BAT For Lead Accumulators: </F> Muldenhuetten Freiberg Soon to Have Europe's Most Modern Plant"]    [Text] Technical Managing Director Hans-Peter Behrendt says  happily that something like 55,000 tons of lead and other  materials will be recovered from approximately 5 million used  batteries "with the most modern plant in Europe." The secondary  lead refining plant at Muldenhuetten in Saxony will be  modernized at an investment expense of DM30 million.    The project is being presented by the company Recycling und  Umwelttechnik GmbH [Recycling and Environmental Technology] at  the TERRATEC in Leipzig. It is contributing to the continuation  of a positive trend: lead release into the environment has been  reduced by 80 percent since 1985 in Germany. Muldenhuetten,  which was first mentioned in 1395, has a tradition in this area.  Silver production was followed there by the production of lead,  zinc, arsenical compounds and sulfuric acids.    The company was adapted through technological improvements  and new buildings to a capacity of 70,000 tons of secondary lead  annually during the GDR era. A record chimney 200 m high became  the new, widely visible trademark of Muldenhuetten. However, its  environmental friendliness was limited to distributing the high  sulfur dioxide emissions--they arose among other things through  the thermal decomposition of the lead paste--widely over the  surrounding countryside. In addition, the lead recycling process  was very energy-intensive and yielded all kinds of waste:  plastic components from the used batteries could not be  reprocessed.    After reunification Muldenhuetten was threatened with  closure. "It could only be averted by a solid solution from the  private sector," Behrendt sums up. The Muldenhuetten business  group was detached from the former GDR collective combine  Saxonia AG. In 1992 the Muldenhuetten Recycling und  Umwelttechnik GmbH was created as a subsidiary of the Rheinische  Zinkgesellschaft [Rhine Zinc Company] of Duisburg.    The group in the Erz Mountains also came in contact with an  experienced sister company on the Rhine, the BSB Recycling GmbH  in Braubach with a related kind of production: accumulator  recycling. It is true that they used a process which was  categorized by the U.S. EPA as "BAT": best available technology.    This engineering process which had proved itself in the  Braubach model plant is now the center of the refitting in  Freiberg. The used batteries were completely disassembled using  the principle of updraft sorting--a prerequisite for the  recovery of all valuable components.    These are the major steps in the process: first worn-out  starter batteries--in acid-proof containers--are brought to the  factory in an environmentally safe manner and stored in a  protected place.    The next step is mechanical disassembly and separation into  electrodes, lead oxide-lead sulfate mixture, polypropylene,  ebonite, PVC and used acid. The desulfurization of the  sulfate-containing portion of the paste with alkalis produces  desulfurized paste and sodium sulfate solution.    Then the charge mixtures are combined and smelted in short  drum furnaces with high-efficiency filters for waste gas  cleansing. The raw lead is refined and alloyed and cast into  marketable form.    The new technology brings along with it many pluses for the  environment. For example, the guidelines of the TA for air on  the limits for toxic emissions are exceeded, in the case of dust  and lead sometimes by up to 75 percent. Production becomes  almost free of waste. The desulfurized lead paste is melted down  and cast along with the grid metal; most of it is put back into  battery production.    Polypropylene, from which the battery cases are made, can be  recovered with a purity of 99.5 percent. In the form of  compounds, which correspond to new materials in quality, they go  out to plastics processors and are reused, for example, in  building groups of the automobile industry.    Used sulfuric acid is completely recovered and can also be  used again. The sodium sulfate which arises during paste  desulfurization is raw material for the cellulose, glass and  detergent industries. "Our sodium sulfate will have detergent  quality," Behrendt promises. All that is left of the  accumulators in the end is ebonite and PVC--about seven percent  of the total weight; an efficient solution to reintroduce them  into the economic cycle still needs to be developed.    The air is becoming cleaner in the Mulden valley and its  surroundings: the sulfur dioxide emissions have been reduced to  less than 10 percent compared to the earlier process.    But the Freiberg group is not satisfied with the traditional  Braubach technology. They want to be the leaders in Europe in  recycling. "We are using the opportunity to incorporate the  newest technological details," technical head Behrendt explains.  This includes improved short drum furnaces as well as slit  screens with finer mesh in the sorting phase; the milling stage  for polypropylenes is completely omitted.    In Muldenhuetten refitting is in full swing at the moment  while production continues. By mid-year the simultaneous game  will have to come to an end. Refitting for the engineering  technology process requires the cessation of the old production.  But then the number of employes will also have to be reduced,  from the current 200 to 150 when modernization has been  completed. For the two old, environmentally harmful  blast-furnaces in the refinery which still remain will be shut  down.    The Freiberg people still have one worry: their West German  parent company, the Rheinische Zinkgesellschaft is a subsidiary  of the Frankfurter Metallgesellschaft [Frankfurt Metal Society]  AG. The giant company is on the verge of bankruptcy because of  mismanagement. A banking consortium staved off the worst at the  beginning of the year--for Muldenhuetten too, it is to be hoped.  "The situation scarcely affected us here," says managing  director Dr. Hans-Joachim Kessler with relief. And he adds, as a  kind of option on the future: "We will not be a burden to the  Metallgesellschaft."    9337</p>

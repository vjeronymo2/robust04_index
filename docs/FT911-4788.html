			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / Survey of European Finance and Investment Offshore Centres (4): Nervous newcomer - Ireland IRELAND is the nervous newcomer among offshore financial centres. In 1987 the government came out strongly in favour of the idea of an International Financial Services Centre (IFSC), to be based on the banks of the River Liffey in central Dublin. In return for tax concessions and other incentives, companies were invited to base their treasury functions in Ireland, in the process creating thousands of much-needed jobs. The government successfully convinced the EC Commission that Ireland suffered because of its geographical isolation in Europe and needed special favours to counter this 'peripherality'. The IFSC, costing more than IPounds 450m Dollars 703m), is now opening for business and the time of truth has come. So far the outlook is good. A carefully co-ordinated marketing exercise has persuaded about 150 companies to set up operations in the IFSC. Of these, 90 are already open for business, employing more than 700 people. The Irish economy has traditionally been dominated by the agricultural sector, but in the decades following the Second World War governments sought to develop an industrial base to combat rising unemployment levels. Generous tax concessions were offered to foreign manufacturers willing to invest in Ireland. The direct precedent for the IFSC was established in 1958, when new legislation granted 25-year tax exemptions to some trading operations based round Shannon airport in the south-west of the country. In 1981, a 10 per cent corporation tax covering the manufacturing sector was extended to service related activities. By the mid-80s it had been decided that Dublin could emulate the successful Shannon Free Zone - home now to a number of financial service companies though more famous for its leading role in the worldwide aircraft leasing business. A derelict docks site close to Dublin city centre was earmarked for a large renewal project. The project's centrepiece would be the IFSC, a cluster of office blocks where international financial services companies could operate under a special tax regime. Apart from the 10 per cent corporation tax rate, the government offered incentives including a 10-year exemption from rates, double deduction of rent expenses for companies holding leases of 10 years or more, and write-offs of up to 100 per cent of new building costs for the first year. Until last year the EC had restricted the concessionary tax rate period to 2000, and the end of 1990 had been set as the deadline for the approval of new projects. Following a meeting between Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish minister for finance, and Sir Leon Brittan, vice-president of the EC Commission, the tax concession period was extended until 2005 and new projects could be approved up to the end of 1994. While the EC Commission has shown itself to be well disposed to the growth of the IFSC, some European tax authorities are discreetly letting it be known that they will not tolerate firms moving operations to Dublin merely as a means of tax avoidance. The Irish government has highlighted its exclusion of 'brass plate' companies from the site. 'We don't want to promote it as a tax haven,' says Mr Reynolds. Only genuine companies are being admitted - ones which employ identifiable staff and hold out the prospect of indirect contributions to the Irish economy through using local banking and professional services. Generating employment remains one of the government's primary aims, and it has predicted that eventually up to 7,000 jobs may be provided by the Centre. The Industrial Development Authority, the state body which promotes inward investment, wants 5,000 jobs created at the centre by 1993. As well as the tax concessions offered at the IFSC, its promoters also highlight Ireland's EC membership, proximity to London and low rents compared with other centres - though there have been complaints that there is a need for more supervision of the letting process. Much emphasis has been placed on the ready availability in Ireland of well-educated, English-speaking young people. While the employment 'shake-out' in London and elsewhere has eradicated any labour shortages in the sector, the Irish have built up considerable financial services skills. Against these attractions is the unusually high rate of personal tax in Ireland, where a single man can pay taxes of almost 50 per cent on earnings of less than IPounds 15,000 per year. The government is making efforts to reduce personal and indirect tax rates, but the burden of interest payments on an IPounds 25bn national debt has made any substantial progress difficult. Domestic institutions have tended to lead the way in establishing a presence in the IFSC. Allied Irish, the country's biggest clearing bank, took the lead by purchasing the first office block to house its treasury activities. Bank of Ireland has purchased its own block and several big companies - Daiwa Securities, Chase Manhattan, Citicorp and Swiss Bank Corp - have added their names to the tenant list. Activities which qualify for the IFSC's incentives package include dealings in foreign currencies, general asset management, Undertaking for Collective Investments in Transferable Securities (ucits), plus related activities such as insurance, accounting and the development of computer software to meet the specialist demands of the sector. Those responsible for marketing the IFSC have had to adjust some of their more ambitious targets as the recession has begun to take its toll. But the IFSC is very much open for business.</p>

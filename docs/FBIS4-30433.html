			<p>BFN     [Text] Berlin, June 27 (YONHAP) -- Choe Chong-nam, a  representative of Hanchongnyon, the Federation of Student  Councils in South Korea, left Berlin for Pyongyang last Friday,  a source here said Monday.    An official at Pomchonghangnyon, the Pan-National Federation  of Youth-Students for Unification of the Fatherland, said that  Choe, 25, a horticulture major on temporary leave from Seoul  National University, had left for Moscow aboard a (North) Korean  Airways Flight from a German Airport.    Officials of Pomchonghangnyon, which arranged Choe's visit,  saw him off at the airport, according to the source.    It is not yet known whether Choe has already arrived in  Pyongyang via Moscow or if he is still in the Russian capital.    Pomchonghangnyon, the Joint Organization of South and North  Korean Students Headquartered in Berlin, declined to comment on  Choe's whereabouts, saying only that it will announce the  relevant details in a few days.    Choe, at a press conference here last Friday, said he  planned  to stay in Pyongyang for a couple of weeks to meet with key  officials including North Korean President Kim Il-song to convey  Hanchongnyon's position on peace and unification on the Korean  peninsula.    Hanchongnyon has entrusted Choe with contacting Kim Il-song,  political groups and social organizations, clarifying its  opposition to unification through absorption, demanding that  Seoul and Pyongyang implement the South-North basic agreement,  and calling for the conclusion of a North Korean-U.S. peace  accord and a package deal on the nuclear problem.    Choe will be the second representative of a South Korean  student activists group to visit North Korea without government  permission. Yim Su-kyong of Chongdaehyop, the defunct National  Council of Student Representatives, visited the North Korean  capital to participate in the Pyongyang Youth Festival from June  30 to Aug. 15, 1989.    After returning through the truce village of Panmunjom, Yim  was indicted and sentenced to five years' imprisonment. She was  released under a special pardon on Dec. 24, 1992.</p>

			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / German economic growth will slow further GERMAN economic growth will slow further in the third quarter of this year, the DIW economics institute said yesterday, writes Christopher Parkes. Real output, which fell by 1.5 per cent in the second three months, will drop another 0.5 per cent in the period ending September 30, it claimed. Falling employment and reduced industrial order intake will lower consumer spending, and investment in the east of the country will suffer from the loss of management confidence. Official figures for the second quarter are expected to be published in early October, although ministers have talked of a 1 per cent decline. Exports are also on the way down, the institute said, because of weak investment abroad, lack of consumer confidence, the strength the the D-Mark against the US dollar, and high interest rates.</p>

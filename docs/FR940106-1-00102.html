			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> After considering the information presented by EPA, the Service has determined that, if implemented, EPA's proposed water quality standards would likely significantly affect critical habitat as proposed in the October 3, 1991, rule. Consequently, the Service is proposing this revised rule to reduce the potential for inconsistencies between EPA's standards and the Service's proposed critical habitat. Resolving the inconsistencies will afford the smelt the same or better protection as would have been achieved through the earlier proposal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Relationship Between Fish and Wildlife Service and EPA Actions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Clean Water Act and Endangered Species Act as written do not specify how government actions should be coordinated or agency conflicts should be resolved. However, because the Service and EPA recognize that their proposed regulatory actions overlap both biologically and economically, both agencies are working closely to provide a comprehensive, ecosystem-based approach to the protection of the fish and wildlife resources of the San Francisco Bay/Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta Estuary. This coordination should also provide a set of regulatory actions that are integrated in both substance and timing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act requires that all Federal agencies ensure that their actions do not jeopardize the continued existence of listed species or adversely modify listed species' critical habitat. EPA's proposed action to designate water quality standards must comply with the section 7 requirement. EPA has initiated a formal consultation process under section 7. Additionally, the Clean Water Act requires protection of the most sensitive use within each category of designated uses. Protection of endangered and threatened species is considered a designated use within the meaning of the Clean Water Act; therefore, a species listing under the Endangered Species Act provides one method to identify the most sensitive use within the designated uses of a water body.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Biologically, the proposed critical habitat for the delta smelt and the salinity criteria that constitute EPA's proposed water quality standards are directly related. Specifically, the occurrence of salinities of 2 parts per thousand (ppt) in Suisun Bay was identified as a critical habitat primary constituent element in the October 3, 1991, critical habitat proposal. Subsequent scientific publications indicate that salinities associated with the distribution of delta smelt may provide the best basis for setting standards for many species that are affected by freshwater discharge from the Bay/Delta Estuary. Favorable conditions from February through June are extremely important to the abundance and reproductive success of almost all species that live in or migrate through the upper Bay/Delta Estuary. EPA's proposed water quality standards address the location of 2 ppt salinities from February to June and, therefore, address both critical habitat requirements for delta smelt and a range of interrelated parameters that affect other species that rely on estuarine habitat.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=3 --> Habitat Requirements <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Historically, the delta smelt is thought to have occurred from Suisun Bay upstream to the city of Sacramento on the Sacramento River and Mossdale on the San Joaquin River (Moyle  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  1992). Recently, however, Wang (1991) recorded larval delta smelt from the Sacramento River as far north as its confluence with the Feather River. The delta smelt is an euryhaline species (tolerant of a wide salinity range) that spawns in fresh water and has been collected from estuarine waters up to 14 grams per liter (ppt) salinity (Moyle  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  1992). For a large part of its annual life span, this species is associated with the freshwater edge of the entrapment zone (mixing zone at the saltwater-freshwater interface), where the salinity is approximately 2 ppt (Ganssle 1966, Moyle  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  1992, Sweetnam and Stevens 1993).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Helicopter Performance Plan <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 4 requires that, before departure, the air tour operator must complete a performance plan for the helicopter flight. The pilot in command (PIC) is required to comply with the performance plan. The plan must be based on information in the rotorcraft flight manual (RFM), considering the maximum density altitude to which the operation is planned and must address such elements as maximum gross weight and center of gravity, maximum gross weight for hovering in or out of ground effect, and maximum combination of weight, altitude, and temperature for which height-velocity information in the RFM is valid. This requirement is necessary in light of accidents attributable to the failure of the pilot to stay outside the avoid area of the helicopter height-velocity envelope. The flight is not limited to the out-of-ground effect (OGE) ceiling, and the helicopter may be operated at a higher altitude provided no hovering is planned. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This requirement should enhance flight safety in light of certain accidents, including that which took place on May 20, 1989. On that date, an Aerospatiale AS350D was on a local sightseeing flight to view Waialae Falls with six passengers on board. After hovering at a low altitude near the falls, the pilot began a pedal turn and forward movement for the initial climb away from the falls. The main rotor revolutions per minute (rpm) decayed, and the pilot turned back toward the upper falls, where he thought he could land. However, the helicopter settled into a ravine, damaging the helicopter and injuring the pilot and passengers. The NTSB determined that the probable cause of the accident was the pilot's failure to maintain rotor rpm, while turning and taking off from a hover with a relatively heavy gross weight. Additional factors related to the accident were the high density altitude and rough/uneven (rocky) terrain in the emergency landing area. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Helicopter Operating Limitations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 5 requires that the PIC shall operate the helicopter at a combination of height and forward speed (including hover) that would permit a safe landing in the event of engine power loss, in accordance with the height-velocity envelope for that helicopter under current weight and aircraft altitude. This requirement is necessary to prevent pilots from hovering for periods of time beyond the performance capability of the helicopter and outside what the height-velocity diagram permits for safe operation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This requirement prohibits aircraft from being operated in dangerous flight regimes, such as the January 25, 1993, accident discussed previously (when the pilot was hovering at a low altitude over a lava flow). It also is intended to prevent the type of accidents that occurred on March 25, 1994, and April 18, 1994. On March 25, 1994, the pilot of a Hughes 369D helicopter operated under part 135 lost control and collided with mountainous terrain by the Puu'oo Vent in Hawaii National Park. The helicopter had become enveloped in a steam cloud at a 40-foot hover just before the pilot lost control. The helicopter was destroyed; the pilot and passengers sustained minor injuries. On April 18, 1994, a Hughes 369D helicopter lost power during an OGE hover and collided with rocky terrain below Waimea Falls, Waimea, Kauai. The helicopter was on a sightseeing flight operated under part 135. The pilot and three passengers were seriously injured. One passenger was fatally injured. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The requirement increases the possibility of safe landing in the event of engine failure. A safe landing may not be possible if the helicopter is within the avoid area of the height-velocity envelope when the engine failure occurs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Minimum Flight Altitudes <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 13 (KCNA) -- The South Korean  authorities must no longer detain Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan,  old men who had suffered in prison for more than 30 years, but  unconditionally send them back to the Northern half of Korea  where their families and relatives are waiting, urged the  Ghana-DPRK Friendship Association in a letter sent to the South  Korean Red Cross on April 21 demanding the repatriation of the  unconverted long-term prisoners, Kim and Ham.    The letter expressed regret at the fact that the South  Korean  Red Cross was still failing to exert efforts for the two old  men's repatriation. To meet their demand for repatriation is a  just and fair behavior in view of humanitarianism and the  international law, it noted, urging the South Korean Red Cross  to help so that Kim and Ham may return to the DPRK without delay.    The letter strongly demanded that the South Korean  authorities abrogate the "National Security Law" and set free  all the prisoners of conscience including unconverted long-term  prisoners in South Korea.</p>

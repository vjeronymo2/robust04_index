			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / German president attacks 'power crazy' politicians GERMAN politicians, undermined by growing voter apathy, declining popular esteem and scandals over pay and privileges, are now facing criticism from Mr Richard von Weizsacker, the president. In an interview with two leading newspaper correspondents, the former leading light in the ruling Christian Democratic Union (CDU), attacks the lack of leadership in the German political establishment, accuses the parties of being 'power crazy' and irresponsible, and questions the direction of the country's unification policy. His words have been seized upon by government opponents as an attack on the ruling coalition, and in particular on his former party colleague, Chancellor Helmut Kohl. That was swiftly rejected by the president's office. The reality is that his criticism was aimed across the entire German political establishment, represented by the hot-house of political intrigue in Bonn. Mr von Weizsacker is concerned at the way party political debate appears to be undermining the constitutional basis of German democracy. The result is that inner-party debates, and the regular 'coalition negotiations' between the three parties in the German government, have become the real decision-making bodies - leaving the classic balance between executive government and parliamentary control little more than theoretical. The president's intervention follows a series of local elections in which all the traditional political parties - his own CDU, the main opposition Social Democratic Party (SPD), the minority Free Democrats (FDP), and the Bavaria-based Christian Social Union (CSU) all lost ground, partly because of voter apathy and partly to the radical extremes of left and right. Scandals over politicians' pay rises have undermined their public standing in Hamburg and Saarland. In the latter, Mr Oskar Lafontaine, deputy leader of the SPD, has just survived a no-confidence vote. Two opinion polls show unprecedented popular scepticism, with those doubting the veracity of their political leaders rising from just one third in 1977, to 60 per cent this April. In another poll only 28 per cent believed the right people were leaders. What appears to have worried Mr von Weizsacker most of all, however, is the scepticism directly related to unification. In the east, mistrust of politicians is highest of all, and real unemployment is still rising. In the west, there is unwillingness to face the full costs of helping the east. The president has already appealed for a new national tax to pay for the eastern economy. That was flatly rejected by Chancellor Kohl and his colleagues. His latest intervention should step up the debate. Observer, Page 17</p>

			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / Telling on tax dodgers earns a qualified reward The Inland Revenue revealed yesterday that it pays informants who help it to catch tax dodgers. Unfortunately for the informers, it taxes them on the extra income. The disclosure that the Revenue has paid up to Pounds 20,000 a case for information leading to the recovery of unpaid tax is tempered by its insistence that each individual reward should be notified as unearned income untaxed at source. The sums however, are not always so large. Payments can be less than Pounds 50 and have never exceeded a 'handful' in any recent year. In the year to March 1994 it paid out a total of Pounds 7,050, Pounds 2,750 in the year before, and Pounds 24,250 the year before that. In its annual report, the Revenue pointed out that funds recovered with the help of informers formed a small part of the Pounds 4.7bn collected in the last financial year in non-compliance - equivalent to 2.5p in basic income tax. However, it will not be turning informants away. 'We are obliged to investigate any information brought to our attention. We take no moral stance,' an official said. Under legislation dating from 1890, the Revenue is entitled to pay up to Pounds 50 for information. Any payments over that level must be approved by the Treasury. All payments are discretionary. The revenue emphasises that payments are made only after a successful investigation and the recovery of funds. A secret formula relates the reward to the amount of the recovery. 'In most cases a reward is not what they are looking for,' the official said, but some ask if one exists. Personal grievances between business or marital partners are a common reason for information being offered. In one case study released with the annual report, an informant told the Revenue of Pounds 150,000 transferred by Mr A from an account in Jersey to the UK. No record existed in Mr A's tax returns of offshore accounts. Mr A denied the charge but, using statutory powers, the revenue confirmed it, and the bank's security video showed Mr A withdrawing the funds in person. He was sentenced to 12 months in prison and fined Pounds 10,000 plus costs. In another, unrelated case, a group of Revenue executives known as 'ghostbusters' discovered coach drivers working for a local company who were selling refreshments and souvenirs, and offering duty-free goods by pooling passengers' unused allowances. Much of the extra income was not declared. So far, 10 of the 18 moonlighters have settled with the Revenue, which is seeking repayment of Pounds 70,000.</p>

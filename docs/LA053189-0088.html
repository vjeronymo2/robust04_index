			<p><P> May 31, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Trump Shuttle Picks Ad Agency: It didn't take long for the Trump Shuttle to  shuttle in a new ad agency. The former Eastern Airlines Northeast Shuttle,  which real estate developer Donald J. Trump gained control of last week, named  the New York ad firm Scali, McCabe, Sloves Inc. as its agency of record. The  agency, which creates ads for Perdue Chicken and Volvo, plans to begin an ad  campaign within the next few weeks. Although the agency won't say, many expect  the new campaign to focus on the reduced rates the shuttle plans to charge --  and Trump himself is expected to play a prominent role in the ads.  </P></p>

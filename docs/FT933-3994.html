			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Coats Viyella hits Pounds 63m and keeps an eye on China COATS Viyella, the textiles and clothing company, is hoping to reduce gearing by 20 per cent by enticing preference shareholders to convert to ordinary stock with an enhanced dividend. The offer of a scrip dividend was announced as the group unveiled a 35 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 62.8m (Pounds 46.4m). Turnover rose to Pounds 1.2bn (Pounds 1bn). Profits were helped by a Pounds 7.2m gain from the lower pound and a 50 per cent increase in UK operating profits to Pounds 20.8m. Following a series of acquisitions and joint ventures borrowings rose to Pounds 503m (Pounds 474.5m) representing gearing of 62 per cent. This is expected to fall to around 45 per cent by the year end. However, this could be cut by another 20 per cent if the 119m preference shareholders convert to ordinary stock in order to take advantage of the scrip dividend. Its value of 4.875p compares with the declared ordinary interim dividend of 3.25p (3p). For each share offered under the issue Barclays de Zoete Wedd is offering cash of 4.7775p. The shares yesterday rose 1p to 257p. The group is confident that the stock will remain above the preference shareholder conversion level of 251p until the end of the month. If the scrip is taken up by shareholders it will save the company Pounds 25m which will be used to invest in the company's joint ventures in China. Mr Neville Bain, chief executive, said: 'We have already signed six joint ventures and are confident of clinching more shortly. There are enormous opportunities in China; there are 1.2bn people who are not fully clothed.' Mainland Europe was the only area where profits fell. Mr Bain blamed the deepening recession for the decline in Continental profits to Pounds 12m (Pounds 19m) and said further rationalisation would take place in the second half. Earnings per share rose to 5.9p (4.3p). COMMENT Coats Viyella's scrip dividend is worthy of support since the company is pin-pointing specific investment in China which should offer a good rate of return. With net cash inflow from normal operating activities jumping from Pounds 13m to Pounds 52m shareholders are not being asked to shore up the balance sheet. Borrowings are likely to fall sharply by the year end as preference shareholders convert to ordinary stock to qualify for the enhanced payout. That would give the company more headroom to build on its investment in China and make further strategic acquisitions. Forecast annual pre-tax profits of Pounds 150m put the shares are on a prospective multiple of 17.7. With further gains from the devaluation of sterling to flow through the shares still look attractive on a premium rating.</p>

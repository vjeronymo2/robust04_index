			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / Fixed-rate home loan costs rise Halifax, Britain's biggest building society, is today re-issuing a range of fixed-rate mortgages at higher rates amid worldwide concern over the cost of lending. The move came amid reports that other leading building societies were taking similar action and withdrawing existing fixed-rate offers. The interest charged on the Halifax's three-year fixed-rate mortgage is being raised from 6.7 per cent to 6.75 per cent. The old five-year rate goes up from 7.2 per cent to 7.25 per cent, an extra Pounds 9 a month on a Pounds 50,000 loan, while 10-year fixed mortgages undergo the biggest hike from 7.99 per cent to 8.25 per cent. Two-year mortgages remain unchanged at 6.2 per cent, and the Halifax has introduced a new four-year term at 6.99 per cent. Leeds Building Society was reported to have scrapped its five-year fixed rate of 6.95 per cent and replaced it with a higher-rate mortgage deal. At the same time Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester, Coventry and National Counties building societies were also said to have withdrawn fixed-rate offers, without yet announcing substitutes. Halifax said the fixed-rate changes were caused by changing conditions in the money market. Building societies were having to accept the cash they use to prop up fixed-rate offers at less favourable rates. Halifax added: 'The rate reflects what is happening in the money market at the moment. 'Our general mortgage rate of 7.64 per cent is untouched, but fixed rates are totally different. We have to go and raise money on the money market to finance them.'</p>

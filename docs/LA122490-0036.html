			<p><P> December 24, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ;  </P> <P> GRAHAM RAISES THE STANDARDS  </P> <P> Giorgio's Place is one of the Southland's less accessible jazz locations, but  once found, in a large office building in Long Beach, it offers such rewards as  the voice of Sandy Graham, who was on hand Friday and Saturday.  </P> <P> Long a local presence, Graham is a poised and ingratiating performer whose jazz  inflections are immediately apparent.  </P> <P> Making occasional and effective use of a personalized vibrato, she brings  individuality to a generally well-selected group of standard songs, none of  them excessively familiar.  </P> <P> Opening with "You and the Night and the Music," a 1934 Howard Dietz-Arthur  Schwartz collaboration, Graham sustained the rhythmically compelling mood that  had been established in a preliminary instrumental set by the Vicki Von Eps  Trio. Von Eps, an engaging soloist and intelligent accompanist, was hampered by  the overloud bass of Bob Saravia. Tony Inzalaco on drums completed the  threesome.  </P> <P> Graham gave warmly sensitive readings of "Good Morning Heartache" and "Lover  Man." Her closer was an unlikely selection: "Ace in the Hole" -- not the old  barroom ballad but a much hipper song from a 1941 Cole Porter show. She brought  to it an effervescence that marks all her up-tempo forays.  </P> <P> Graham has a long track record as a first-rate purveyor of seldom-heard songs.  It is high time to find room for her on the record scene, provided that  unreconstructed singers still have a place in that money jungle. LEONARD  FEATHER  </P></p>

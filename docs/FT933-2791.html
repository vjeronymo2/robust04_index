			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / SIB to draw up City 'hit-list': Regulator prepares to ban 'unfit' individuals from investment business THE Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief regulatory watchdog, is preparing for the first time to ban individuals from the investment business whose behaviour it believes poses a threat to investors. In a move likely to alarm some parts of the investment industry, the SIB is already reviewing several cases and considering bringing charges against some individuals. Separately, the Stock Exchange announced measures yesterday requiring corporate directors to disclose all the terms of their remuneration, including stock options and bonuses, in a move aimed also at increasing protection for investors. For the first time, companies will have to explain how much it will cost shareholders if the director is dismissed before the contract's expiry date. Existing rules offer a loophole by which directors can keep some of the most expensive details private. Huge payoffs to directors dismissed for incompetence have been a source of dismay to institutional shareholders, who have been pressing for a greater say in the terms of executives' contracts for the companies they invest in. Although unrelated, the moves are aimed at two of the areas that have attracted the greatest public and political criticism and might help to deflect assertions that regulators have been lax in protecting investors since the Financial Services Act was passed in 1986. The SIB said its intention in banning individuals was 'not intended to punish'. Instead, its goal will be to protect investors from future damage and to deter others who might be considering similar activities. It said: 'We are beginning to draw cases together. We have asked the recognised bodies to nominate individuals and clearly we could have individuals under consideration.' Initially, the SIB intends to use its powers 'sparingly' until it can assess the costs. 'The disqualification powers will generally be used by SIB to focus on cases where, in SIB's opinion, there is serious unfitness which is not being already appropriately addressed,' the SIB said. Those who are the subject of a ban will have the opportunity to appeal to a Treasury-appointed tribunal. The SIB has had the power to ban individuals since its creation, but not once in its six-year history has it ever considered doing so. The decision to begin banning individuals stems from a review of the SIB's authority conducted this year by its chairman, Mr Andrew Large, in which he considered whether new legislation was needed to protect investors. In April, Mr Large said he did not believe legislation was necessary but said the SIB needed to use more fully the powers it did have. The SIB said: 'In assessing unfitness, SIB will pay attention to an individual's conduct in relation to SIB's principles and to the risk of recurrence of misconduct. Evidence about past misconduct and of signs of persistence, wilfulness, recklessness or negligence, following from that will be relevant.' Directors face tough Stock Exchange rules, Page 9</p>

			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Derwent Valley leaps to top Pounds 1m Derwent Valley Holdings, the property group, hoisted pre-tax profits by 86 per cent from Pounds 603,000 to Pounds 1.12m in the first half of 1993. The company pointed out that the results did not benefit from the share issue and acquisitions announced in June. Following the Pounds 16.9m issue of new shares, Derwent invested Pounds 10.3m in several properties, all of which are let on long leases. An office building in Victoria was acquired for Pounds 1.8m, while the remaining proceeds of Pounds 4.8m would be used for future purchases and refurbishment of existing properties. Net property revenue improved from Pounds 3.15m to Pounds 3.22m. Earnings per share climbed from 5.2p to 9.9p, and an interim dividend of 3.05p (2.9p) is declared on the increased capital.</p>

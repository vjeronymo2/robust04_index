			<p>930102 FT  02 JAN 93 / Fashion: Banish the Grey - It is time for the British male to brighten up his act UNLIKE his counterparts in the bird kingdom, the British male is usually drab. There might be a flash of colour at the throat or on the chest, but he shies away from primary or secondary colours, assuming he knows what they are. There is, however, change afoot and, like magpies, our British male is being attracted to 'brights'. It could be a reaction to the grey weather, or a long-delayed decision to make a visible display to attract the opposite sex. Whatever the reason, sartorial life looks as if it is going to be more colourful in 1993. Once colour was the preserve of the Italians, the French, and even the Americans (remember all those bright tuxedos?). Now the British male is also being tempted to buy clothing which is not grey, black or navy. You will not see the migrating flock of grey suits on London Bridge turn overnight into an exotic and colourful flight, but you will begin to see red jackets appearing on the street, at parties and in restaurants. Red is no longer the exclusive domain of huntsmen, guardsmen or Butlin's redcoats. There are those who think that colour does not become the British complexion. But this is a fallacy; in the 18th and 19th centuries, the male was a peacock and it is only during this century that colour has become associated with vulgarity, eccentricity and effeminacy. But greys, blacks, browns and dark blues have now become the colours of the male plumage, with the occasional chance to wear some bright tweed in the country or a pastel blazer in the summer at some jolly boating event. Now the British male has the opportunity to invest in colour for his wardrobe. In most menswear shops, from the easily accessible Oakland and Next to Jones with its emphasis on top-class international designers, colours across the spectrum are being introduced on to the rails. And Paul Smith proves that English designers are not afraid of colour, offering not only clothing but also belts and shoes in various colours. In Savile Row, a cuckoo has appeared among the distinguished ranks - Richard Jones offers beautifully cut 'traditional' clothes made from wonderful cloth in marvellous hues. Colour is not about vanity - we all perhaps remember too well the Aesop fable in which the crows gathers feathers from other birds so as to be able to rival the peacock, only to be humiliated because of his presumption. Instead, it is about having the confidence to pluck out just a handful of grey feathers and replacing them with some brighter ones.</p>

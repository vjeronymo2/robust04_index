			<p><P> April 8, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ON THE HOUSE: HOME IMPROVEMENT;  </P> <P> WHY CERAMIC-TILE FLOOR CRACKS IN BATHROOM  </P> <P> QUESTION: Why is my newly installed ceramic-tile floor cracking in one of the  two bathrooms I just refloored and not in the other? My home has a wood floor  system, and the tile I did in the other bathroom has held up beautifully with  no damage at all. I had stripped off the old linoleum floor coverings,  installed mortarboard atop the subfloors in both bathrooms, and used the same  tile, tile adhesive and grout in each instance.  </P> <P> ANSWER: Actually, your mistake was quite simple. You assumed mortarboard was  the same as the real thing, and a check as to the condition of the wood floor  was not made: You failed to ensure that the floor framing members (the skeleton  like series of wood members that support the flooring) were strong enough to  resist deflection (sagging or bending) when walked on, and that the same  problem did not exist at the subfloor itself.  </P> <P> Unlike carpet, wood and linoleum floor coverings, ceramic tile is quite  brittle. Hence, when the tile-covered wood floor deflects (moves), the brittle  tiles crack.  </P> <P> Eliminate localized floor movement. The most common method is to apply a layer  of mortar (mixture of cement and sand -- sort of like concrete without the  rocks) between the subfloor and the tile. Steel reinforcing bars embedded in  the mortar lend to its overall rigidity.  </P> <P> Mortarboard may provide the smooth surface needed to accomplish a professional  looking tile job, but it will not necessarily eliminate movement. In tract  homes it is very common to see ceramic tile laid directly onto "beefed-up" wood  floors, but in finer custom homes the subfloor is dropped 2 inches or more in  areas where ceramic tile will be placed to allow for a thick (strong) mortar  bed.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Fiberglass Preferred for New Shower Pan  </P> <P> Q: We are remodeling our bathroom and will need a new shower pan. Our  contractor has suggested fiberglass or terrazzo. Can you tell me what the  difference is between the two?  </P> <P> A: Yes. Both are very popular. Although they have been around for a long time,  modern production techniques have greatly improved their overall quality.  </P> <P> The fiberglass shower receptors are generally one-piece molded products with a  nonskid surface. They are very sturdy, easy to clean and and resistant to  fading, staining, fungus and abrasion. You will find these most commonly  available in white or off-white.  </P> <P> The terrazzo shower receptor is a little more decorative. It is constructed of  tan-and-white marble chips cast in Portland cement. The surface is ground and  polished, then grouted and polished again. It too is a very durable product and  requires very little maintenance. Although terrazzo is somewhat more expensive,  it will not necessarily last longer than fiberglass. Exclusive of your personal  taste for appearances, we would recommend the fiberglass.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Removing Unsightly Non-Skid Appliques  </P> <P> Q: I have some of those decorative non-skid appliques on my bathtub that have  become quite unsightly. How may I go about removing them?  </P> <P> A: These adhesive-bound appliques, which come in a variety of colors, shapes  and sizes are designed for bathtubs that aren't manufactured with an integral  non-skid surface. They serve a very important purpose, especially since studies  have shown that the majority of home accidents occur in or around bathtubs.  However, after some time they do tend to deteriorate and need to be removed and  replaced.  </P> <P> If your tub has a porcelain finish the most effective method of removal is with  the use of a sharp razor blade. Any adhesive residue that may remain can be  removed with a mild detergent and warm water.  </P> <P> Fiberglass or acrylic tubs pose a more difficult problem, because their finish  may be more easily damaged if great care is not employed. Razor blades are a  no-no here. Manufacturers of these synthetic products recommend using acetone  and a clean soft cloth. Make sure that there is adequate ventilation when  working around acetone vapors. They can be hazardous to your health.  </P> <P> Should your attempt to remove the appliques fail, there are firms that  specialize in tub refinishing. Some are even equipped to install a new clear  nonskid surface over the entire area.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Removing Water Stains From Wood Ceiling  </P> <P> Q: How do I get the black water stains off our tongue-and-groove wood ceilings  after roof leaks?  </P> <P> A: Well, needless to say the first step is to repair the roof leak and permit  the wood ceiling to completely dry. Then a trip to your paint supply company  for some wood bleach is in order.  </P> <P> This product is generally applied in two parts. The first solution is applied  directly to the stained area and left to stand for about five minutes, then,  while the surface is still wet, the second solution is applied.  </P> <P> Use a nylon brush or rubber sponge to apply the wood bleach. Separate  applicators should be used for each solution. After both solutions have been  removed and the area has been permitted to dry, lightly sand it to remove any  residue that may remain. Most important, remember to follow the manufacturer's  specifications and always wear rubber gloves and proper eye protection.  </P> <P> The Careys are syndicated columnists and general contractors in the San  Francisco Bay area.

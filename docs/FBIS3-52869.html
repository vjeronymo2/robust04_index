			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Defense Minister Muhsin Dallul by Walid </F> Shuqayr and Muhammad Shuqayr in Beirut; date not  given--individual correspondent not identified]    [Excerpt] [Correspondent] What are the circumstances  surrounding the smashing of the network suspected of being  responsible for the explosions in Tripoli and Sidon?    [Dallul] The aim seems to be to hinder the process of  reconciliation and fence-mending in Lebanon. Security organs  have, for some time, been following leads in this case. We have  identified certain people--manipulated from outside the  country--targeting certain positions, including commercial  businesses in Tripoli and Sidon and Lebanese Army, and, at  times, Syrian Army positions. Such incidents began to happen in  rapid succession, particularly in Tripoli and Sidon, aiming at  certain targets in particular. Nor did they target only stores  selling alcoholic drinks. They also selected targets of a  special nature and belonging to members of certain religious  communities in particular. We had to pursue the matter. Having  followed numerous leads, security forces busted the bulk of the  subversive networks. There has not been any explosions in  Tripoli or Sidon since.    [Correspondent] Don't you think that these explosions must  be viewed within the context of a plan to destabilize Lebanon in  the run-up to the al-Asad-Clinton summit? And what do you think  about reports of attempts on the lives of al-Asad and Clinton  and al-Hirawi?    [Dallul] Talk about attempts on the life of President  al-Hirawi is nothing new; it dates to 1991. I don't know why it  is being raised now. I think that raising the subject at this  point in particular is calculated to create a climate of panic  and fear. As to why that is, the aim is manifold: For one  thing, to undermine al-Asad's position ahead of his scheduled  session with President Clinton, so Lebanon becomes a liability  for the Syrian leader. For another, to deflect attention from  the stalled Gaza-Jericho accord, especially given the fact that  Lebanon, as a democracy, affords the right and regionally  unmatched climate for the media to disseminate such reports.  Third, the idea is to undermine Lebanon's negotiating position,  especially after King Husayn of Jordan criticized the  Gaza-Jericho agreement [as published] and the PLO and the way it  handled the negotiations, and adopted Syria's and Lebanon's  line. For us, this is a key issue. The U.S. line has,  throughout, been to support Israel's argument that it needs a  breather to absorb the Gaza-Jericho accord before progress can  be made on the other tracks.    The Americans were a bit doubtful that the Gaza-Jericho  first  option could advance without parallel progress on the other  tracks. Our argument, and that of the Syrians', was that, unless  accompanied by progress on the other tracks, the Gaza-Jericho  accord, stood no chance. Now, the Gaza-Jericho accord has  proved a losing bet. There is now a consensus on the need for  movement on the other tracks.    [Correspondent] Is it fair to draw the conclusion that the  activities of these subversive networks were to counteract  opposition to the Gaza-Jericho agreement?    [Dallul] I don't want to divulge secrets just yet. However,  the security organs investigating the explosions will before  long reveal facts to the news media if they think it necessary.  The explosions did not appear out of the blue. They destroyed  business premises and other property, and were calculated to  advance specific objectives. The circles with a vested interest  in destabilizing and undermining Lebanon and al-Asad's position  as the date for his summit with Clinton draws near, will go to  great lengths to promote the interests of the other side.    We are not pointing accusing fingers at anyone in  particular.  However, there are many forces that reckon they can use the  Lebanese arena to advance their strategies.    [Correspondent] A person has been killed and another  wounded on the Darb al-Sim [name as published] east of Sidon.  Reports say they are Palestinians and they were carrying  explosives. Have you got any information about them and the side  to which they belong?    [Dallul] It is premature to disclose this information.  Investigation and arrests are still under way. The issue is  related to more than one event, and secrecy will benefit both  the investigation and the issue.    [Correspondent] Are you optimistic about the possible  results  of the 12th round of negotiations?    [Dallul] Certainly, because the Syrian and Lebanese tracks  cannot be separated. President al-Asad stressed this personally  and refused to separate the liberation of southern Lebanon from  that of the Golan.    Regarding pessimism or optimism, Resolution No. 425 was  issued by the Security Council and not by the UN General  Assembly. I believe it constitutes a confusion and a setback in  the Lebanese policy but not a disaster because we have a  Security Council resolution. We went to the negotiations under  the Madrid formula and after receiving letters of assurance from  the sponsors of the conference, the United States and Russia,  which dealt with Resolution No. 425 and its implementation.  Were it not for this resolution, we would not have taken part  in the negotiations. Hence, the issue is related to a certain  mechanism that will exist. It is certain that the upcoming  summit of President al-Asad and President Clinton implies  optimism and lessons to be learned. In other words, the  steadfast, rather than those who are loitering at the gates of  the White House and the gates of embassies, always succeed.    President al-Asad is the only leader in the world who meets  the U.S. President in the middle of the road. This has not  happened to any president in the world. All leaders support  al-Asad, and the meeting is a victory for President al-Asad  because he still controls matters despite reports and  allegations that Syria and Lebanon are in trouble and that the  Gaza-Jericho option has stolen the limelight and will lead to  peace at the expense of the Golan and southern Lebanon.    This is not true at all, and the upcoming meeting in Geneva  proves that the weight is still here and not there. The Syrian  and Lebanese tracks should move together to achieve progress in  the Gaza-Jericho track. If the Syrian and Lebanese tracks do  not achieve progress, the Gaza-Jericho agreement will soon fail.    President Clinton will not come to a meeting unless he  believes he can push matters toward peace in the Middle East.  Otherwise, the move would weaken his position and not that of  al-Asad, who is still steadfast and adheres to a certain  position. Therefore, Clinton may have become confident that he  can force Israel to offer realistic concessions or persuade it  of such a need--concessions which are Arab rights and which the  Arabs want to regain. Without these, he cannot attend any  summit because it will be a big failure for his policy, in  addition to his repeated failure in Somalia, Bosnia-  Herzegovina, and other states. He also has domestic and foreign  problems and he cannot afford another big defeat like this.    If the Geneva conference succeeds, it will cover all his  defeats because the results of the conference will be much more  bigger than what is taking place in Somalia, Bosnia-Herzegovina,  or any other country in the world.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Deputy Prime Minister Tariq 'Aziz has stressed that  U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher was mistaken on many  of the issues that he discussed in his article, which he wrote  from Saudi Arabia, published in THE NEW YORK TIMES on 28 April.  In a reply published by THE NEW YORK TIMES today, Saturday,  Tariq 'Aziz explained that the first mistake that Christopher  committed was his characterization of the states calling for  lifting the siege imposed on Iraq as just some states. The  deputy prime minister said that the states calling for a change  in the policy on Iraq, particularly the immediate lifting of the  economic blockade, include numerous UN Security Council member  states, Arab states, and Iraq's neighbors, especially Jordan and  Turkey, which are suffering from the blockade imposed on Iraq.  He added that the official statements of the Special Commission  and the International Atomic Energy Agency conflict with  Christopher's remarks that Iraq has not complied with its  commitments toward the UN Security Council.    Tariq 'Aziz explained that the UN Security Council failed to  issue its president's traditional statement because the U.S.  representative objected to recognizing the progress that has  been made by Iraq. Meanwhile, he noted, other UN Security  Council member states, including three permanent members,  insisted on the need to recognize this progress. He indicated  that Mr. Christopher's assessments do not represent the  viewpoints of the majority of the UN Security Council member  states.    Tariq 'Aziz called on the U.S. secretary of state to check  the U.S. State Department's records to learn of the U.S.  intervention to prevent Kurdish leaders from signing an  agreement with the Iraqi Government in the summer of 1991. He  explained that the Iraqi Government agreed with six Kurdish  parties, including those led by Mas'ud Barzani and Jalal  Talabani, on a comprehensive agreement for autonomy in the  Kurdish region. However, Edward Djerejian, assistant secretary  of state under James Baker and Warren Christopher, prevented  Talabani from signing the agreement on the pretext that such an  agreement would bolster the government of President Saddam  Husayn.    Tariq 'Aziz added that the U.S. State Department's records  testify to those facts. In addition, all partners to this event  are still alive.    In his reply to Christopher's article, Tariq 'Aziz said that  the comprehensive blockade imposed on Iraq since 1990 has left  Iraq with no choice but to depend on itself, especially with  respect to food production. Therefore, all national resources  have been mobilized to implement development projects in the  marshlands area in southern Iraq. He explained that specialized  U.S., British, Netherlands, and Russian companies studied such  projects as early as 1950 to reclaim 1.5 million hectares.    In a separate development, the deputy prime minister  stressed  that a clear progress has been made in the recent UN Security  Council review of the embargo imposed on Iraq. In statements to  the director of the Detroit expatriates television aired today,  Saturday, Tariq 'Aziz said that there is currently a clear  majority at the UN Security Council adopting a fair position.  He explained that the U.S. position at the UN Security Council  uses allegations that do not conform with reality. He said this  is a position that does not enjoy absolute British support, but  a limited support for reasons that have nothing to do with UN  Security Council resolutions.    Tariq 'Aziz expressed confidence that the majority of the  international community now calls for lifting the blockade  imposed on Iraq. He said that majority of the UN Security  Council member states, which reflect the majority of the world  public opinion, have moved toward lifting the blockade. He  explained that the United States, Saudi Arabia, and Kuwait  worked vigorously before the recent UN Security Council review  to prevent the council from recognizing the facts. Despite the  funds that they have spent and despite their false allegations,  'Aziz added, the majority of the UN Security Council member  states have adopted positive trend.    Relying on facts that he sensed during his recent visit to  the United Nations, the deputy prime minister expressed  optimism. He said that after the steadfastness of the Iraqi  people and their leadership and after facts have become known to  world public opinion, the call for lifting the blockade is now  stronger than ever before.    On the situation in northern Iraq, Tariq 'Aziz told the  expatriates television that it is an anomalous situation imposed  by foreign powers on our Kurdish people and in which armed  groups took part. He said that those groups are behaving  irresponsibly and without any consideration for the interests of  our Kurdish people or for the general national interests. He  explained that the fighting raging between the Barzani and  Talabani groups has resulted in hundreds of deaths and in  disrupting life and public services. Meanwhile, he said, foreign  U.S. and Iranian interventions are taking place, in addition to  the Turkish air raids on villages in the area.    The deputy prime minister stressed that the northern part of  the homeland must return to the homeland, and that the  authority, law, and security must return to the region which  flourished under autonomy and under the national Iraqi  leadership.</p>

			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / International Company News: Biogen shares up 50% on drug test Shares in German drug company Schering fell 5 per cent yesterday following a 50 per cent rise in those of US biotechnology company Biogen as the likelihood of competition in the fast-growing multiple sclerosis drug market increased. Swiss company Ares Serono, which is developing a drug similar to Biogen's, saw its share price rise by 17 per cent yesterday. Biogen this week reported preliminary results of final phase trials of its beta interferon drug which, it claimed, cuts the frequency and scale of multiple sclerosis attacks over a six-month period. The company was sufficiently confident to increase production in the US and marketing in Europe. Full data on the clinical trials would be presented in October, it said. Schering sells its own beta interferon product called Betaseron, the only such product approved by medical regulators for patients. This month, the company said 1994 sales of Betaseron would reach DM300m (Dollars 190m). Analysts at Lehman Brothers estimate the market for beta interferon at Dollars 500m-Dollars 1bn a year by the end of the decade. The share price rise took Biogen's market capitalisation to about Dollars 1.5bn, the fourth biggest in the biotech sector. This week, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, the Israeli-based group which has another multiple sclerosis drug in development, said it was setting up production facilities in Israel after viewing preliminary data of final stage trials of its treatment Copaxone. It expects to file its multiple sclerosis drug for US approval this year or early 1995.</p>

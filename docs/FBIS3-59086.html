During the meeting, President Glavkos  Kliridhis briefed the National Council members on a draft letter  he had prepared for UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali  giving the position of the Greek Cypriot side. This letter is  to sent to the secretary general following a similar letter sent  to Butrus-Ghali by Denktas.    Government Spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis said that President  Kliridhis does not consider Denktas' answer on the  confidence-building measures to be positive, stressing that it  contains the old demands in disguise.    Speaking after the National Council meeting, DISI  [Democratic  Rally] Chairman Ioannis Matsis noted that Kliridhis' letter to  Butrus-Ghali deals with all the positions Denktas presented in  his own letter to the secretary general, which are just as  negative as they were in New York. Responding to a question on  whether we are considering disengaging from the  confidence-building measures and discussion of the substance of  the Cyprus issue, Matsis said that all issues are now at the  forefront.    AKEL [Restorative Party of the Working People] Secretary  General Dhimitrios Khristofias said he estimates that Denktas  will not change his positions, but added that he does not  consider that Denktas' letter proposes unacceptable terms.  Unfortunately for our side, Denktas' letter is framed in a  diplomatic way. Khristofias expressed the view that our side  will be in a difficult position.    DIKO [Democratic Party] Chairman Spiros Kiprianou repeated  that he considers the confidence-building measures to be  dangerous, and that the best possible development would be to  disengage from these measures. Denktas' letter, he said,  reveals that the Turkish side wants to use the  confidence-building measures to gain even greater benefits in  its effort to promote its goals.    Socialist EDEK [United Democratic Union of Cyprus] Chairman  Vasos Lissaridhis said that Kliridhis' letter to the secretary  general offers a golden opportunity to deal with the substance  of the Cyprus issue. If this golden opportunity is not used, he  said, there is a danger of getting involved in indirect talks on  the implementation of the confidence-building measures, which,  he added, constitute a de facto solution of the Cyprus issue.</p>

			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / Brussels court orders arrest of Groupe Schneider chief A Brussels court issued an international arrest warrant yesterday for Mr Didier Pineau-Valencienne, the chairman of Groupe Schneider, one of France's largest electrical groups. The court order could provoke further strains between France and Belgium over the fate of Mr Pineau-Valencienne, who faces charges of fraud and embezzlement relating to two of Groupe Schneider's Belgian subsidiaries. Schneider's shares fell sharply on news of the warrant's issue. The shares closed FFr7.70 down at FFr399.50, having dropped to a low of FFr387 during the day. French law does not permit the extradition of French citizens, but a Belgian justice ministry official said last night: 'If Pineau-Valencienne goes anywhere outside France, he will be arrested.' Schneider last night issued a statement describing the warrant as 'totally illegal'. Mr Jean-Michel Loyrette, the lawyer representing Mr Pineau-Valencienne, said his client would not comply with the warrant, which followed the Schneider group chairman's boycott of a court hearing in Brussels last Saturday. Late last month, the group announced that Mr Pineau-Valencienne would not attend any of the Belgian hearings on the grounds that his detention for 12 days in a Brussels jail earlier this summer was unlawful. He was ready to co-operate with the Belgian authorities, but only in France under the supervision of French legal authorities. Mr Pineau-Valencienne's failure to appear before the Belgian investigating magistrate means he faces the loss of BFr15m (Pounds 300m) in bail, according to an official at the Belgian justice ministry. Mr Pineau-Valencienne faces charges relating to complaints filed by minority shareholders in Cofimines and Cofibel, two Belgian financial subsidiaries of Schneider. Belgian prosecutors say that assets worth about BFr4.8bn were concealed from shareholders and regulators, and that dividends from offshore companies belonging to the subsidiaries were not distributed to all shareholders. The arrest warrant comes at a time of fierce controversy about white-collar crime in France. He is one of several prominent industrialists recently placed under investigation including Mr Jean-Louis Beffa, chairman of Saint-Gobain.</p>

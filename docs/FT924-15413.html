			<p>921005 FT  05 OCT 92 / Management: Some tender memories of the Bundesbank - Power lunching Heinz Schimmelbusch, chief executive of the Metallgesellschaft mining, metals and engineering group, is exceptional among senior Frankfurt businessmen in that he enjoys going out for a business lunch. His chauffeur drives him to his favourite Italian restaurant 10 minutes from the centre of the town and, while his body-guards wait outside, Schimmelbusch commands a corner of the room, orders the food and launches into a lively discussion of his plans for the company, and much else besides. Schimmelbusch's willingness to go out to lunch perhaps dates back to early in his career when - already marked out for great things - he spent some time working in New York with a Wall Street investment bank and became used to more relaxed eating habits than are the norm in Germany. Top businessmens' diaries are booked up years in advance and they simply do not have the time, or the inclination, to go out. As Hellmut Hartmann, chief press spokesman for the Deutsche Bank, Germany's biggest bank, explains, the bank's main board directors tend to have a bowl of soup and sandwiches at their desks as they get on with their work. Of course, main board directors - the Gods of the German financial world - have the facilities to entertain honoured guests. Sal Oppenheim, the private bank, is reputed to have the most exquisite cuisine of all the banks in Frankfurt: unfortunately this correspondent cannot pass judgment on the quality of the food there, having not (yet) received an invitation. He can, however, vouch for the tenderness of the wild boar occasionally served at the Bundesbank. One step down from board level, bankers must eat canteen food, palatable and cheap, but canteen food all the same. The most senior have their own dining rooms but, again, get canteen food. Despite all this, there is a lively restaurant scene in Frankfurt. Eating out is mainly the preserve of the large community of intermediaries - brokers, lawyers, advertising executives and public relations people - and it is done predominantly when foreigners come to town. It is a strange fact that, but for one or two notable French and German restaurants, the bulk of restaurants in this city are Italian. The proprietor of the local pizzeria suggests that there are 560 outlets for Italian food in the city of Frankfurt alone, and many more in dormitory towns such as Kronberg, Konigstein and Bad Homburg. Of these, a dozen or more are excellent restaurants where one can eat exquisite food at what - by the standards of other world financial centres - is a reasonable price. Many of these are clustered in the Westend, the elegant residential and office district five minutes away from the financial centre. The restaurants are informal, one can take off one's jacket and sit outside when the sun is shining. Michele Castagno has run Florian, one of the most popular Italian restaurants of this class, for the last 12 years. He says that up to half his customers at any given lunchtime are non-Germans. Most do not appear to have met their lunch partners before, and Castagno notices a perceptible relaxing of tension as the meal proceeds, the wine begins to take effect, and client and customer began to feel at ease with one another. At lunchtime, 60-80 per cent of Castagno's customers eat fish. There is a choice of 60 wines, although most of the customers drink no more than one or two glasses, with many drinking nothing but water. A typical light meal would consist of mushrooms or carpaccio (raw meat) followed by veal, fish or a mixed pasta dish, rounded off with fruit salad and a cup of coffee. The menu (above) is on a grander scale, but it would not finish off either wallet or stomach: four fine courses would cost no more than DM100 (Pounds 40) per person (without wine) and you ought to be able to stroll round the corner afterwards to have a meeting at 3pm without needing a siesta. However excellent and varied, Italian food can begin to pall if one is obliged to eat out two or three times a week. There are one or two good French restaurants (Erno's Bistro, for example, near the Palmengarten) and Humperdinck earns its Michelin Star for its fine 'international' and French food. Serious business is not discussed over lunch, at least not in public. It is however an important topic when top businessmen get together for drinks parties in the evening. It is probably harder to get an invitation to one of these parties, than to be invited to lunch at Sal Oppenheim.</p>

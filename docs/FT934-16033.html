			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / Technology (Worth Watching): Green PCs turn the power off Over the past six months several personal computer manufacturers have launched 'green PCs' that use less electricity, writes Louise Kehoe. None, except IBM, has addressed the fundamental issue of encouraging PC users to switch off their machines when not in use. 'Rapid Resume', a feature incorporated in IBM's new line of PS/1 computers, overcomes the drawback of switching off. When the new PS/1 is turned off, the system automatically remembers what the user was doing. When turned on again, the machine returns to the exact spot, eliminating the need to re-open Windows applications and find working documents. And if the user forgets to turn off, Rapid Resume will do it when the system has not been used for a pre-selected period. IBM: US, 914 945 3884; UK, 0705 321212.</p>

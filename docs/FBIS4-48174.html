			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report]  <H8>  THE STAR </H8>   The Rainbow Cabinet -- President Mandela's first Cabinet is  "a mixed bag," its composition "partly determined by the  constitutional provision that parties which achieved a specified  amount of electoral support had to be represented," notes an  editorial in Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 11 May on page  8. Keeping Keys and Roelf Meyer and the portfolios of the three  IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] ministers "strike a good balance,"  while "most interest -- and criticism -- has centered" on ANC  appointees such as Alfred Nzo and the omission of Cyril  Ramaphosa. The deputy premiership for the "controversial Winnie  Mandela is bound to raise hackles in some quarters." The  "absence" of Freedom Front leader Viljoen and "the entire white  right is unfortunate." However, the "most pertinent question" is  how the "rainbow Cabinet" will function. "Winnie Mandela will  need to co-operate closely with her minister, the IFP's Dr. Ben  Ngubane. Bantu Holomisa is deputy to Environment Affairs and  Tourism Minister, Dawie de Villiers. Home Affairs Mangosuthu  Buthelezi must work together with Public Works' Jeff Radebe, the  ANC's southern Natal leader and a bitter enemy in the past."  Were the implications not so serious, it might be said these  combinations were put together by someone with a fine sense of  humor. But co-operation at Cabinet level will be vital if the  new dispensation is to work effectively." Cabinet members and  their deputies "will have to approach their new roles in the  spirit of reconciliation so apparent in President Mandela's  every action since assuming the presidency."  <H8>  BUSINESS DAY </H8>   Cabinet of Reconciliation -- "President's Nelson Mandela's  insistence on Tuesday that the entire nation should give equal  respect to the two halves of the double-barrelled national  anthem was yet another symbolic illustration of what is more  materially apparent in the construction of the Cabinet," begins  the Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 13 May in a page-10  editorial. "From the perspective of those who may have had  fears about the future and the ANC's plans for it, Mandela has  gone far further than could reasonably have been asked of him in  giving meaning to the concept of reconciliation." Both the  National Party and the Inkatha Freedom Party have been given  "more Cabinet posts than their electoral performances entitled  them to"....and have been given "quality portfolios which should  build public confidence generally." BUSINESS DAY adds that  Buthelezi's appointment to a "national rather than regional"  portfolio is "visionary." The positioning of the ANC's "two  `unguided missiles' -- Winnie Mandela and Bantu Holomisa" also  shows "extensive thought." The idea being that they can cause  less harm inside government than outside. The editorial writes  that "it seems that reconciliation is a higher priority than  efficiency and experience."  <H8>  NEW NATION </H8>   Foreign Involvement in Ending Apartheid Viewed -- "It was a  joyous week for all South Africans as we were joined by the  world in celebrating the inauguration of President Mandela, who  has over decades come to personify the ideals that so many had  given up their lives for." So begins the Johannesburg NEW  NATION in English on 13 May in a page-7 editorial. "However, it  must be of concern to many that, while statesmen from countries  to the north of us were acknowledged in as far as they were  accorded places alongside leaders from Britain and the United  States, there was no specific mention of the scale of the  sacrifices that their people made." Angola, Mozambique, Zambia,  and Tanzania are mentioned, but most the editorial's praise is  reserved for Cuba. "What needs to be said very forcefully is  that we might not have been in a position to celebrate a victory  this week had it not been for the Cubans, who in the spirit of  internationalism, committed their lives to defeating apartheid's  defence force at Cuito Cuanavale."</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> With respect to the determination of the Threshold Amount, each of the pre-specified rates of return will be at least equal to a minimum rate of return as specified in Part III, Section (q) of the proposed exemption. In determining the Threshold Amount, different assets or different groups of assets may be subject to different annual rates of return, with the rate of return applicable to any particular asset being established by the Agreement. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Net Proceeds in excess of the Funds invested capital plus the minimum return must actually be achieved (or deemed achieved upon the Termination Date or the removal of the asset manager) in order for the Threshold Amount to be reached. The Performance Fee payable to an asset manager may be reduced by all or a portion of any fees previously paid to the asset manager with respect to the assets under any prior fee arrangement if and to the extent such a reduction is called for by the Agreement and shall be subject to such other limitations as AT&amp;T may impose. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> AT&amp;T represents that under the Agreements, asset managers will not have discretion to shift assets within the Arrangement from one class to another, and that AT&amp;T will be responsible for determining whether assets may be shifted from one class to another during the term of the Arrangement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 6. As a specific provision of any Agreement which gives an asset manager complete discretion over the acquisition and disposition of assets, AT&amp;T will require that for any sale of an asset which causes the payment of a Performance Fee and which occurs prior to the Termination Date, the sales price for the asset must be at least equal to a certain amount (the Target Amount) in order for the asset manager to sell the asset and receive the Performance Fee without further approvals. The Target Amount for each asset will be assigned either at the time the asset becomes subject to the Arrangement, as agreed between AT&amp;T and the asset manager, or pursuant to an objective formula approved by AT&amp;T and the asset manager at the time the Arrangement is established. If the proposed sales price of the asset is less than the applicable Target Amount, the proposed sale must be disclosed to AT&amp;T for approval in order for the asset manager to receive its Performance Fee as a result of the sale. If the proposed sales price is less than the applicable Target Amount and AT&amp;T's approval is not obtained, the asset manager will continue to have authority to sell the asset but the Performance Fee which would have been payable to the asset manager by reason of the asset sale will be paid only at the Termination Date. Under each Arrangement subject to the proposed exemption, all realized income on, and proceeds from the sale of, the assets, net of expenses and reasonable reserves, will either (a) be reinvested in assets subject to the Arrangement, if the Agreement so provides or if AT&amp;T so determines pursuant to the Agreement, or (b) cease to be subject to the Arrangement and thereby become Net Proceeds. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> AT&amp;T represents that the Target Amount concept provides protection for the AT&amp;T Investment Fund to assure that an asset manager will not sell any assets at unduly low prices to trigger immediate payment of the related performance fee. AT&amp;T states that this concept is intended to provide a floor on the price at which an asset can be sold and the performance fee paid immediately without having to obtain AT&amp;T's approval. For newly-acquired assets, the minimum floor is deemed to be the cost of the asset; for previously acquired assets, the minimum floor amount is the value of the asset at the time the asset becomes subject to the Arrangement, an approach which AT&amp;T represents to be the most logical to establish the minimum Target Amount for previously acquired assets. AT&amp;T notes that it has the flexibility to negotiate a higher Target Amount in any case where it believes the minimum Target Amount permitted by the proposed exemption would be inadequate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / Peace talks delegates see Arafat PALESTINIAN delegates to the Middle East peace talks last night held their first public meeting with Mr Yassir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, in a pointed challenge to Israel a few days before next week's election in the Jewish state. The carefully staged encounter in Amman was accompanied by an appeal by Mr Yasser Abed-Rabbo, a senior PLO executive committee member, for Israelis to 'vote for peace' in next Tuesday's poll. He said there would be little optimism if Mr Yitzhak Shamir's ruling Likud party won again. Such interventions by the Palestinians tend to rebound in favour of Likud and its right-wing allies. Although Mr Abed-Rabbo did not mention the opposition Labour party by name, the right wing is bound to use his words to portray Labour, which supports a more conciliatory stance in the peace talks than Likud, as being supported by the PLO. But this did not deter the PLO going ahead with last night's event at which Mr Faisal Husseini, the leader of the Palestinian negotiating team, Mrs Hanan Ashrawi, the spokeswoman, and Dr Haidar Abdel-Shafi, chief negotiator, met and embraced Mr Arafat in front of the press. Israeli jets raided alleged Hizbollah bases in south Lebanon yesterday, the 14th air raid in a month.</p>

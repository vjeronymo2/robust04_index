			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / UK Company News: PhoneLink in red as product costs bite PhoneLink, the USM-quoted electronic information company, yesterday blamed start-up costs of its Tel-Me network for pre-tax losses of Pounds 1.76m in the year to March 31. The company said the losses - against a Pounds 30,000 profit last time  - were less than expected for a system which, it claims, will deliver on-screen information more rapidly than any other on the market. Mr John Lyon, chief operating officer, expressed confidence that Tel-Me would emerge as the company's flagship product and overtake profits generated by DataCare, its telephone directory service for database users. Although DataCare generated gross profits of Pounds 746,000 (Pounds 608,000) and underpinned a 35 per cent increase in turnover to Pounds 1.24m (Pounds 922,000), Mr Lyon said PhoneLink was concentrating its efforts on marketing Tel-Me to some 400,000 small businesses. The system, launched in May following a 2 1/2 year development, offers a wide range of on-screen information. 'Tel-Me is now in place and we've moved from being a technology company to being a service supplier,' said Mr Lyon. The service has been sold to a number of large corporations including South Western Electricity and Guardian, the insurance group, and some 60 computer dealers have agreed to sell the system. The company has also persuaded IBM to install the necessary software in its personal computer products and help market it. Costs, meanwhile, have been contained by the decision to shelve plans to relocate from its Prenton plant near Liverpool, saving more than Pounds 1m. Mr Lyon warned, however, that developments costs were likely to exceed Pounds 3m before the system began to generate profits. Until then, the company said it would continue to draw on cash reserves of Pounds 7.3m left over from its flotation in May last year. Losses per share came out at 5p, against earnings of 0.1p.</p>

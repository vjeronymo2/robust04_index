			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / Mr Majtricht's logic Once again we must give the lady credit. The voice was that of Mr John Major but the essence of the speech the British prime minister delivered in London yesterday could have been enunciated by Lady Thatcher. He spoke as a European leader, the current president of the EC. Seen through the eyes of his predecessor's acolytes, he has become Mr John Majtricht, the Conservative who would sell out to the centralisers. Yet they should look again. Europe is coming round to her point of view. Take, as a comparative text, the celebrated speech she made at Bruges in September 1988. She spoke of the community as a 'family of nations, understanding each other better, appreciating each other more, doing more together but relishing our national identity no less than our common European endeavour'. Yesterday Mr Majtricht acknowledged that many European citizens fear for their national self-identity, and wonder whether it will be lost. 'You could sense that debate in Denmark, . . . in France, . . . in the new German Lander, . . . in the UK,' he said. 'The Community must show that these fears are phantoms, . . . it must recognise . . . national identity and national pride, not appear to ride roughshod over them.' The rhythm persists. In 1988 she said: 'Our future must lie in willing and active co-operation between independent sovereign governments, each answerable to their national parliaments.' Yesterday he said: 'European democracy begins with the traditional institutions that people understand and feel close to; these are the parliaments, assemblies, folketings, bundestags of each of their own countries.' She said that Europe must 'continue to maintain a sure defence through Nato'. He said that Maastricht 'maintains the primacy of Nato while building up the European role within Nato'. He wishes to maintain the American presence in Europe; so did she. She said, before the collapse of the Soviet empire, 'we shall always look on Warsaw, Prague and Budapest as great European cities'; he reaffirmed that 'all of us have decided that it is essential to embrace the democracies to the east'. Historians will decide how many of Lady Thatcher's prophetic phrases were hers and how many must be ascribed to her foreign affairs Rasputin, Sir Charles Powell. What we can now see - but curiously, she now cannot - is that the idea of a united states of Europe is at worst a distant nightmare. The Community is a congeries of sovereign states, perpetually concluding new treaties that, so long as they endure, are binding upon all members. The political half of European union, as envisaged in the Maastricht treaty, would be an extension of this concept. It would not be an irrevocable step towards the supranational monolith still irrationally feared by the Conservative Europhobes. The economic half of the treaty is something else again. If it were to be cemented by a single currency and a single bank, national sovereignties would indeed be diminished. If you fear that, take it easy. The cries of those who say that such an outcome is inevitable are beginning to sound less convincing with every creak and groan of the exchange rate mechanism. Mr Major is aware of this, but does not let himself get carried away. He must take credit for an important rule of European behaviour that it was never in her nature to accept. It is: try to sound like a team player, even when you are not. He was thus able to attract praise as a good European yesterday while enunciating the principles of a Europe des patries. Indeed, the ability to utter sincere phrases with a forked tongue is the prime minister's unique contribution to contemporary political debate. For example, yesterday he rejected the accusation that Britain wants no more than a large free-trade area. Then he devoted half a page of close-typed text to the merits of the case for Europe as a large free-trade area, 'binding together the nations of Europe in a common economic framework'. Again, he spoke of working 'with the grain of the market and not against it', and then, straight-faced, went on to assert that 'this is of course what the ERM does, and will continue successfully to do, whatever happens to the Maastricht treaty'. With logic like that, our prime minister could sell raincoats in the Sahara. The underlying purpose of it all is, naturally, to cover the government's tail. If the French vote No, yesterday's speech will have prepared the way to save face. If they vote Yes, the same speech will, in retrospect, sound like a brave and successful stand on principle. The identical insurance policy is being taken out against either a solution to the Danish No vote, or no solution to it. That is the difference between Lady Thatcher and her successor. She went against the grain of contemporary opinion. He smoothes it over. Funny. She was eaten up by the European debate. He, so far, has survived.</p>

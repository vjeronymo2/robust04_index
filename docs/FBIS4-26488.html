			<p>BFN     [Text] Canberra, June 23 (XINHUA) -- Visiting Chinese State  Councillor Li Tieying said today that foreign trade has played a  prominent role in China's economic development.    In 1993, the total volume of China's import and export  accounted for over 35 percent of its GNP, measured with the  internationally accepted indicators, Li told the Australia-China  Business Council in Melbourne this noon.    "Since 1979, China's total volume of foreign trade has been  growing at an average annual rate of 16 percent," Li said in a  speech at the luncheon in honor of him by the council.    Li said that this rate is higher than the growth rate of  China's GDP and that of the world trade during the same period.    Li, who is also minister in charge of the State Commission  for Restructuring the Economic Systems, arrived in Melbourne  this morning for a nine-day visit to Australia after ending his  tour to New Zealand.    He told the host that China has maintained favorable trade  terms and its foreign exchange reserve is kept at the normal  level, reaching 21.2 billion U.S. dollars at the end of last  year.    Li said that it is China's basic national policy "to further  expand its opening-up to the outside world, vigorously develop  its foreign trade and widely involved itself in international  cooperation and exchanges."    Last year, China's total import stood at 104 billion U.S.  dollars and is estimated to reach 1,000 billion U.S. dollars in  the next seven years.    "China's development cannot be achieved without cooperation  with other countries," Li said.    He also said that "China's development and cooperation with  other countries are also important for the promotion of world's  economic and trade development and the maintenance of global  peace and stability."    On the Sino-Australian bilateral economic relations, Li said  that last year, the two countries enjoyed a two-way trade of  three billion U.S. dollars, up nearly 29 percent on the previous  year.    Australia has so far invested in over 1,300 projects in  China, with a total contracted investment of 1.25 billion U.S.  dollars, making it the ninth largest investor in China.    China has also set up over 70 non-trade enterprilion U.S.  dollars.    Li said that the two countries have broad prospects for  cooperation in the fields of economy, technology, culture and  education.</p>

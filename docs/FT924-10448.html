			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / Italian fears underlined ALMOST 60 per cent of all public works contracts in Italy are awarded on a discretionary basis, according to a parliamentary study out yesterday. The study was prompted by public concern over corruption in public works contracts as a result of the Milan municipal scandal. Investigations by Milan magistrates have revealed systematic abuses, with tenders rigged and commissions handed out to the political parties for up to 5 per cent of the contract value. The discretionary nature of most public works tenders is regarded as a big encouragement to corruption. The evidence in the study is expected to speed efforts towards a more transparent and competitive system of tendering. The study examined public works contracts worth L48,291bn (Pounds 22bn). Of this, L28,582bn concerned projects where the contracts had been awarded on the basis of private treaty, concessions or uncompetitive tenders 'which failed to comply with the basic requisites of publicity'. Among the worst offenders were government bodies and big state companies.</p>

			<p>920523 FT  23 MAY 92 / Two men (and four fish) on borrowed time in a boat: Why North Sea salmon fishing may be a dying trade FIVE am. Britain sleeps, on the brink of a heatwave. In the Northumberland fishing village of Craster, skipper Eddie Grey and his deckhand Eddie Williams lean over the harbour wall, studying the slaty North Sea and the mist draping the ruins of medieval Dunstanburgh castle. 'Looks hashy, mind,' says Eddie Grey. The brisk southerly snaps at his woolly bobble hat. The southerly is a dirty wind, he says. It chops the sea, scrambling the rolling 'lippers.' So are they going back to their beds? No. Eddie darts down the rungs fixed against the harbour wall and jumps, agile in knee-high wellingtons, into his little wooden boat, the Supreme. Craft like this - cobles, successors to the Viking longboats they resemble - have been used for centuries, solely on England's north eastern coast. Freshly painted in blue and white, the red canopy on the Supreme's sharp, rising bow lends her a jaunty air. But her flat-bottomed, blunt-ended stern is no-nonsense Northumbrian - designed so that fishermen without safe harbours can haul their boats up the beach. (In bad tides, the Supreme is winched up over ash logs in Craster harbour.) A monofilament salmon net 600 yards long, 15 foot deep, topped with plastic corks, lies folded in the coble. For the right to use this net from March 26 to August 31, between 4am and 8pm on weekdays only, starting at 6am Monday and ending 6pm on Fridays, Eddie has to pay the National Rivers Authority (NRA) Pounds 775 a year. Salmon is vital to him; he supports a wife and four children. But he may be living on borrowed time. The UK Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAFF) has been won over by lobbying, by Scottish and English riparian owners and anglers, convinced that the north east drift net fishery is depleting river salmon stocks. While MAFF says it has no evidence of an 'immediate threat' to salmon stocks from the fishery, it has 'invited' the NRA to phase out the 143 drift net salmon licences between Holy Island and Whitby. The NRA's response is due next month. The Supreme's wireless, together with its longitude and latitude navigator, are fixed under the canopy. Eddie-the-deckhand jumps into the boat; she glides between the piers. Eddie-the-skipper gazes ahead, left hand on the tiller at the stern. Deckie Eddie turns up the diesel engine throttle. The Supreme rises up and skates over the waves, dipping like a duck, surging over the tumbling ebb tide. A wall of water looms; the little craft flies over the foam. Eddie-the-skipper's left hand seems scarcely to move. The coble is so low in the water that you can touch the sea - yet it barely splashes inboard. (Later he explains how the coble, made of overlapping larch planks riveted with copper nails, must be nudged and 'shouldered in' to each wave; steering straight across could crack a plank.) Two miles out, he stops; it is time to shoot the net across the tide. This 'net' is actually nine separate nets joined together by hand, in varying colours, the better to fool the fish. By 6am the net is played out. The Supreme glides away from it, its engine off; the kettle goes on a camping stove for tea. The two Eddies munch sandwiches as the 33 foot coble is buffeted about. They never feel 'shabby' (seasick), but sometimes landlubbers have been so violently seasick that they have had to be helped to the only place to lie down: the board over the engine. Breakfast over, everything is put away. 'I don't like slovenliness about a boat,' says Eddie. Care of the Supreme, bought new for Pounds 15,000 in 1979 (with the help of some grant aid), is of great importance: cobles, craftsman-made by eye, today cost more than Pounds 60,000 each. Eddie Grey, who is 42, must keep his craft going if he is to have any chance of working all the way to his retirement age. The two Eddies steer the coble along the length of the net. Then they spot it - a silver flash of salmon, caught by the gills. Skipper Eddie hooks the net; deckie Eddie leans overboard, brandishing a circular net on a long pole. They grab the fish, prise it out, throw it aboard; it gasps, quivers and is still. A second salmon follows, a big one. The net has also trapped two guillemots. Gently, the two Eddies snip them out. Deckie Eddie, a pigeon fancier, cradles the birds, stroking them, then lowers each one on to a wave. They squawk, and fly away. The coble called the Supreme has no winch; 600 yards of net must be pulled in by hand. The men haul, one each side. They move on, shoot the net again and retreat. 'This job needs patience and perseverance,' says Eddie Grey. 'It's boring sometimes.' More tea. Suddenly some corks disappear: it's a seal. 'You get a fish in the net, then along comes Whiskers and eats it before you can get it on board,' Eddie laments. He tweaks the net. They pull in a salmon and a sea trout, haul the net and move again. The sun is high; the dawn chill has gone. Somebody eight miles further out radios to say the crab fishing is dire. The Supreme, like most cobles, fishes for crabs and lobster too; Eddie uses 240 pots, all handmade at home. Crab prices are poor; lobster at Pounds 5 per pound, and salmon at about Pounds 3, are better. But octopi prey on lobsters in the pots, sucking out the flesh. And lobster and salmon stocks are declining. The licenced north east driftnets catch comes to a total of about 40,000 salmon a year, and similar numbers of seatrout. Its critics call the nets 'curtains of death'. 'That's a lot of tommyrot,' says Eddie. Colin Warwick, a Northumberland coble fisherman arguing the men's cause on national committees, thinks so too. A North Sea drift net, he says, is 'like a pair of shoe laces in Wembley stadium.' 'It's really a class battle,' says Warwick. Eddie agrees. 'They just want the lords and ladies to catch salmon - and the people with money, who pay thousands for a day's fishing.' Coblemen blame salmon decline on pollution; overfishing in Greenland; illegal netting by part-timers. Taking away their licences, they say, would force them to put more pressure on other stocks of fish. Back in harbour, the two Eddies carry their four fish to Robson and Sons, the Craster kipper-curers. (The proprietor is retiring; the business is for sale.) The three salmon together weigh 33 lb; they will go to Billingsgate. A visitor buys the trout. Back home, in the house he is buying on Craster's little council estate, Eddie Grey must organise tomorrow's lobster pot bait. Even with salmon fishing he will count himself very lucky if he earns Pounds 10,000 this year  -after boat, licence and insurance overheads. Before the war, 30 cobles fished out of Craster; now there is only the Supreme. Eddie-the-skipper, last of a line of kipper curers and fishermen (he renounced his longing for a son to take to sea after his fourth daughter was born) is desperate to continue fishing. 'I suppose I'd be pretty useless on land; but if somebody off the land was going to do my job, they couldn't. It would be bloody awful if I had to pack it in. I just love the sea; I'm coble daft.'</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "otk": "Will the Quality of Teaching Slovak Be </F> Improved?"]    [Text] Bratislava--A new objection to the budget of the  Ministry of Education has emerged in the ethnically mixed  territories. Under the ministry's pedagogical and  organizational instructions and teaching curriculums, an extra  one to two hours of Slovak language and conversation [per week]  are to be added in schools with a non-Slovak language of  instruction. Moreover, preference is to be given to the  division of classes during Slovak language lessons. Lubomir  Harach, minister of education and science, informed us that the  ministry has released from its budget a reserve of 100 million  korunas to secure education [in the Slovak language] in the  ethnically mixed territories.</p>

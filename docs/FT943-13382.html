			<p>940720 FT  20 JUL 94 / ITV claims advance over Sky channels ITV yesterday claimed it was winning the battle for viewers against Sky Television as it unveiled its Pounds 176m autumn schedule of programmes. Mr Marcus Plantin, ITV's network director responsible for commissioning and scheduling, said sales of satellite dishes were down and there had also been a drop in viewing of Sky Television. 'Sky has been losing to minority satellite channels,' said Mr Plantin. These 'minority' channels - which appear to eating into the share of viewing taken by the six Sky channels in cable and satellite-equipped homes - include UK Gold, the library channel; Eurosport, the pan-European sports channel; and the TNT/Cartoon Channel. ITV figures, based on research by the Broadcasting Audience Research Board, show that the audience share of the six Sky channels in cable and satellite homes declined from 59 per cent in January to 51 per cent in June. In the first six months of last year, before the launch of a range of new satellite channels in September, the Sky channels' share ranged between 68 per cent and 70 per cent. Sky Television is owned by British Sky Broadcasting, a consortium in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a significant stake. Sky One, the most popular satellite channel, was watched for an average of 1.5 hours a week this January, but that figure fell to an average of only 1.2 hours in June, while viewing of Sky movies also declined. Mr David Elstein, director of programmes at Sky, said yesterday that some decline in the Sky channels' share of viewing was inevitable with the arrival of six new satellite channels. The summer drop had been caused by high-profile sports events, such as the World Cup, for which Sky could not bid. ITV said yesterday it had also increased its lead over its nearest rival, BBC 1, by more than 50 per cent during the past few months.</p>

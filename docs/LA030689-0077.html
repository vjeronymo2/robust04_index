			<p><P> March 6, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> The newly elected leader of South Africa's ruling party called for urgent talks  to decide whether he or President P. W. Botha is going to be in charge of South  Africa. Frederik W. de Klerk succeeded Botha as National Party leader after the  president suffered a stroke Jan. 18. Botha has since announced he will remain  as head of state until his term ends in September. "After my conversation with  (Botha) on March 2 and his statements after that, it is clear the time for  (discussing his retirement plans) is fast approaching," De Klerk told the  Sunday Star newspaper. The prospect of Botha, 73, returning to power next month  has dismayed those South Africans who had hoped the government would resume its  reforms of apartheid after years of stagnation on the divisive issue.  </P></p>

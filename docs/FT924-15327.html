			<p>921005 FT  05 OCT 92 / Survey of Technology in the Office (7): Typewriters still in demand - Word Processing You know when a market is not as buoyant as it once was. The market researchers find more pressing subjects to study. So it is with the electronic typewriter (ET) and dedicated word processor (DWP) markets. But although the imminent demise of this sector was forecast when the IBM PC was born 11 years ago, ETs and WPs are still in demand in banks, building societies, educational establishments and government departments. To take just one example, after almost two years of thorough investigation, Barclays Bank has awarded a two-year contract to Triumph Adler UK for the supply of the BSS 300. Ideal for the computerised environment, it offers all the advantages of a typewriter and dedicated word processor, yet comes with MS DOS-compatible disk drives. Triumph Adler also believes there is still a market for the professional typewriter and has revamped the SE 700 series to provide almost silent operation and easier replacement of typewheels and ribbons. Mr Alistair Booth, divisional manager of Olivetti UK, says: 'There is a core market for ETs and DWPs that cannot be served by the PC and, bearing in mind that profit margins have not been squeezed to the same extent, it has been viable for us to formulate a pretty intensive programme of product development.' As part of that programme the company has just launched a Windows version of its top-end secretarial workstation, the ETV4000S, a system that has proved popular among solicitors and architects. According to Olivetti, there is also a growing market among home users, hence the decision to launch a range of portable ETs and a portable word processor last month. Amstrad, too, still finds a ready market in offices for the PCW-dedicated word processors, but also has its eye on the home office market with the launch of a portable WP. Olympia UK finds that the Comfort WP series is still a very popular line. So popular, in fact, that it sees no rush to launch the Competence range which is waiting in the wings. What of Olympia's traditional typewriter ranges? Mr Colwyn Munro, general manager, says: 'The trend is towards providing links so they can be connected up to a PC to provide letter quality printing. It is a growing demand from users who do not necessarily want to put everything through the laser printer.' Panasonic has just launched the KX-W1030 (Pounds 450) portable word processor offering spelling checker, thesaurus and MS DOS file converter, a 14-line backlit display, 3.5in floppy disk drive and 14cps printer. Samsung has entered this sector with the SQ-W1000 (Pounds 299), a system for personal use which offers the convenience of a typewriter with the advanced functions of a word processor and floppy disk storage. Smith Corona may have abandoned the PC marketplace, but it intends to stay in the portable word processing market where it has fielded machines that feature industry standard 3.5in disk drives and MS DOS file format compatibility with WordPerfect and Ascii text converters. Canon claims the Starwriter personal word processor is one of the most successful products it has ever launched. It has launched a fourth, top-of-the-range version which introduces a new concept to this sector of the market: personal publishing. It costs just Pounds 699 for an all-in-one compact portable unit complete with screen, floppy disk drive and bubblejet printer. Brother recently introduced the portable WP-70 (Pounds 525) which features advanced text editing with spelling checker and mailmerge as well as a spreadsheet, address book and calendar/scheduler/calculator built-in. It also includes 3.5in floppy disk drive and 15cps daisywheel printer. Sharp has just launched the sub-Pounds 300 PA-1200 portable word processor featuring a high-contrast LCD display, full-function keyboard and in-built MS DOS-compatible disk drive which runs a modified version of WordPerfect word processing software. The continued demand for ETs and DWPs in no way diminishes the need for word processing software for running on standard desktop PCs. The packages on offer today have little in common with the early 1980s versions. They offer sophisticated editing with spelling checkers and thesauruses and will even check grammar, punctuation, syntax and style, and enable presentation-quality documents to be produced to desktop publishing standards, including graphics and photographs. But although there is a lot more competition, the core market is still dominated by the few. Figures from the May 1992 Software Sales Report compiled by market research specialist Context show that WordPerfect commanded 60 per cent of total UK word processing sales in the second quarter, WordStar 31.2 per cent and Microsoft 7.8 per cent. The total value of software sales in May was more than Pounds 30.5m, of which WordPerfect contributed Pounds 5.4m. While WordPerfect for Windows increased its share of WP software sales by 2.5 per cent to 7 per cent, sales of WordPerfect for DOS rose from 50 per cent to 53 per cent, dispelling the myth that people are only buying Windows software. Indeed, DOS is likely to retain its faithful followers for a long time yet, so further developments can be expected. An example is WordStar for DOS which has been further developed to include, among other attributes, fax support that allows users to easily create laser-quality faxable files (PCX) from their documents without a laser printer. The output files can be used by many fax software products and boards for direct transmission to fax machines or other computers. However, taking a closer look at Windows word processors, a recent report published by market research organisation Romtec indicates that when it comes to market share by units, Microsoft's Word for Windows 2.0 is clear favourite with 58.8 per cent, followed by WordPerfect 5.1 for Windows 23.8 per cent, Ami Pro 2.0 for Windows 13.9 per cent, and WordStar 1.0 for Windows 2 per cent.</p>

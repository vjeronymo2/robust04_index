			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 22 (CNS) -- China saw a decrease of  arable land last year by some nine million mu while some 4.53  million mu were newly developed. The sharp drop of land under  cultivation is now under control in some areas.    Director of the State Land Administration Mr. Zou Yuchuan  stressed the importance of protecting arable land in a national  meeting on legislation regarding land. Mr. Zou pointed out that  a net cut of land under cultivation was put at some four million  mu across the country last year, equivalent to the total of  arable land in seven medium-sized counties. Should the  situation not be reversed, the consequences would be very  serious. He said that China had to guarantee at least one mu of  arable land per person on average by the year 2050 or the food  problem would by then become a crisis. There is to date  cultivated land totalling 1.43 billion mu with per capita land  measuring 1.2 mu.    The administration has suggested that planning for the use  of  land had to be worked out and strictly implemented. The  appraisal and approval of land had to be unified in accordance  with the law and administration of various kinds of development  zones had to be strengthened. A protection area for farming  fields had to be drawn up while policies on the administration  of collective use of land for non-agricultural purposes had to  be strengthened.</p>

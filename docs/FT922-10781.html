			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / Ministers call for swift deal on trade FINANCE ministers from industrial and developing countries yesterday issued an urgent call for a swift agreement to liberalise world trade. Meeting in the interim committee of the International Monetary Fund  - the Washington-based organisation's principal policy-making body  - the finance ministers said a rapid conclusion of the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) was essential to restore dynamism to world trade and would contribute to economic recovery. 'All countries stand to benefit from the round, and would suffer from a failure,' the committee said in a communique. 'The success of the negotiations is a must.' Mr Carlos Solchaga, Spain's finance minister and the chairman of the committee, said it was not easy to negotiate in an election year, but expressed disappointment over the Gatt deadlock. 'It must be said that responsibility is not shared equally among the different members of Gatt. It lies mainly on the US and the European Community,' he said. Mr Solchaga said the failure to reach a new agreement put the IMF in the difficult position of asking developing countries to adopt 'perfectionist' economic policies and open up their own markets, while the industrial countries kept protectionist barriers. In other comments the interim committee communique called for appropriate monetary and fiscal policies to assure recovery and sustainable growth; welcomed signs of a stronger economic performance by developing countries; praised the efforts of the countries of eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union to reform their economies; and expressed its concern that the IMF's quota increase had not yet come into effect.</p>

			<p>Lawmaking   Record   <F P=102> MK2906125094 Moscow MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI in Russian No. 26 26  Jun-3 Jul 94 (Signed to press 28 Jun) p A6 </F>  <F P=103> MK2906125094 </F> <F P=104>  Moscow MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI </F> <F P=105>  Russian </F> BFN   <F P=106> [Yelena Pestrukhina report under the "Parliament" rubric: </F> "Is a Law a Secondary Matter?"]    [Text] On the eve of its six-month anniversary, the State  Duma has drawn up a report on work it has done.    By the end of last week, the chamber had considered 136  bills.    It is State Duma committees that bear the brunt of  legislative sponsorship -- they have drawn up 63 bills.  Individual deputies have sponsored 33 bills; the government,  28; the president, 11; and the Constitutional Court, 1. This  regards what has been done "in gross," whereas the output of  more or less finished products is fairly modest. In all, 15  laws have been passed (of them, seven have already been signed  by the president, and the others are with the Federation  Council). Around 20 bills have been approved in the first  reading and one has passed the second reading.    An overwhelming majority of the approved laws concern the  socioeconomic area. On one hand, this is a package ensuring the  functioning of the economy: the budget plan, the laws on  changes in payments to state extra-budget funds, on state  foreign borrowings and credits. On the other, a package on  social safety nets: on raising the minimum wage and on  pensions. Typically, the government has lobbied for both the  economic and social-populist bills.    The deputies have passed at their own initiative the laws on  their status and on the procedure for the coming into force of  laws enacted by the Federal Assembly. This list also includes  the related law on the Constitutional Court, which the deputies  see as a guarantee of the preservation of parliamentarianism.    Far from all committees have shown equal lawmaking zeal.  According to an established tradition, the main burden has been  shouldered by the legislation committee under Vladimir Isakov  from the Agrarian Party of Russia [APR]. Its record includes  three laws already passed, four laws approved in the first  reading, and 12 decrees. The budget committee under Mikhail  Zadornov from "Yabloko" is second. Third place is shared by the  security committee under Viktor Ilyukhin from the Communist  Party and the committee on labor and social protection under  Sergey Kalashnikov from the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia  [LDPR]. The relatively small defense committee under Sergey  Yushenkov from "Russia's Choice" has two bills that have passed  the first reading and two decrees to its credit. One law and 14  decrees have been "churned out" by the committee on the  organization of the State Duma's work under Vladimir Bauer from  "Russia's Choice."    The performance of these six committees can be considered  effective, or at least noticeable. As for the rest, they  clearly do not bother themselves too much with lawmaking. Seven  State Duma committees each have submitted for consideration only  one bill in six months. They include the committee on  agricultural matters (Aleksandr Nazarchuk, APR); on industry,  energy, and transport (Vladimir Gusev, LDPR); on international  affairs (Vladimir Lukin, "Yabloko"); on natural resources and  nature use (Nikolay Astafyev, LDPR); on the affairs of women,  family, and youth (Galina Klimantova, "Women of Russia"); on  information policy and communications (Mikhail Poltoranin,  "Russia's Choice"), and on geopolitics (Viktor Ustinov, LDPR).    But even this is not the limit of the deputies' "zeal." Four  State Duma committees have failed to propose a single bill or a  draft decree, whereas the others limited their creative work to  drafting one decree or two.    Two "national" and all three "international" committees (on  international affairs, the CIS, and geopolitics) have failed to  find their legislative niche. Nor has the existence of three  economic committees so far been justified by "prolific"  lawmaking -- two of them (on economy and on privatization) have  kept an extremely low profile. It seems that the  overspecialization of parliamentary committees (that also have  subcommittees inside) has only brought about an increase in  offices and titles for the deputies.    If we assess lawmaking from the point of view of party  affiliation, the first striking feature is sluggish work by the  Party for Russian Unity and Accord. Which is strange, because  the faction has brought together many deputies from among civil  servants who are objectively interested in making laws that  would "fit their size." The contribution of "Russia's Choice"  also falls short of the faction's numerical strength or its  potential intellectual capabilities. The agrarian lobby is  acting aggressively and competently, but only within the range  of their professional problems. The communists' work in the  parliament boils down primarily to good attendance of meetings,  hearings, and other "events." The LDPR faction proceeds from  the assumption that laws being passed by the current State Duma  will not be adhered to all the same, so it exploits its presence  in the State Duma only for political horse-trading.    By the time of its recess (in July), the lower chamber plans  to consider around 30 bills "of primary state importance." They  include the draft laws "On the Ombudsman," "On the Counting  Chamber," "On Workers Collectives," "On the State Privatization  Program," and "On Civil Service." The preparation of the Labor  Code will be delayed for an indefinite period along with the law  on the guidelines of economic reform.</p>

			<p><P> July 28, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES: WILSHIRE CENTER  </P> <P> In 1903, when photography was still knocking timidly on the imposing front door  of art, Alfred Stieglitz began publishing Camera Work. In its 14-year lifespan,  the quarterly magazine would make a big case for the aesthetic possibilities of  the medium, aided by the most scrupulous printing methods available and  far-ranging essays on art and photography.  </P> <P> The images in the journal, displayed individually in this exhibit, are  hand-pulled photogravures usually made from the original negatives and printed  on Japanese tissue to retain the delicate gradation of tone. Robert Demachy --  whose 1904 photograph, "Speed," shows a roadster disappearing down a soft gray  road lined with trees -- noted wryly that "For the initiated or perhaps for the  insane . . . there is a most exquisite pleasure in the contemplation of fine  shades" of black "independently of form."  </P> <P> Form in the works on view generally takes on a dreamy aura, bearing out the  Photo-Secession group's belief that a photograph ought to possess the evident  artistry of a painting rather than utilitarian sharp focus. (Stieglitz's views  on this matter changed radically by 1917, when he was a champion of "straight"  photography, but the show emphasizes Camera Work's early years.)  </P> <P> Karl Struss' "The Landing Place" peers down at a gentle summer scene: a  graceful stone balustrade and shady tree overlooking a lake with a lazy rowboat  and barge. In "Ploughing," Stieglitz finds a glorious palette of grays in the  sky above a farmer and the black and white flanks of his horses. Theodore  Hofmeister's "Dachau" brings today's viewer up short with a placid view of  white houses and tall trees. (The photograph predates by 29 years the  concentration camp established on the outskirts of this picturesque German  town.)  </P> <P> Along with nature, young women were favorite subjects. Stieglitz's "Miss S.R."  introduces a moodily attractive femme fatale in a pert hat. As an emblem of  "Spring," he choose a toddler in a bonnet and flaring coat, planted in profile  on the grassy meadow like a giant flower. In George H. Seeley's "The White  Screen," a slender woman in a long gown and flowing shoulder wrap is bathed in  light-dappled shadow.  </P> <P> Other Camera Work photographers whose work is sampled here include Baron Adolf  de Meyer, a specialist in luminous portraits and still lifes, and the  mid-19th-Century duo of David Octavius Hill and Robert Adamson, revered by  members of Photo-Secession as early masters of the photographic portrait.

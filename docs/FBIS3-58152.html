"It will be a very wide invitation that is extended to  Central and East European nations, Russia, Ukraine, and I very  much hope they will take it up," Major told reporters on his  arrival at NATO headquarters.    He said the Partnership for Peace plan under which the North  Atlantic Treaty Organization would give former East bloc  countries a cooperative link with the Atlanic alliance but not  full membership was the best option at present.    The British leader also said the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina  was of concern to NATO heads of state and government,  "particularly amongst those with large numbers of troops there."    But he indicated there was unlikely to be any major change  in  NATO policy on the 21-month conflict, noting that the alliance  had already approved the use of air strikes if requested by the  United Nations.    "That was the position and that remains the position today,"  Major said.</p>

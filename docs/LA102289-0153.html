			<p><P> October 22, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> OREGON ST. LATEST TO EMBARRASS BRUINS;  </P> <P> UCLA: IT FAILS TO CONTAIN OREGON STATE'S RUNNING ATTACK IN 18-17 DEFEAT.  </P> <P> Before its exuberant fans tore down the goalposts Saturday, Oregon State  stripped away a little bit more of UCLA's prestige.  </P> <P> The Beavers all but eliminated the Bruins from the Rose Bowl race, rallying for  an 18-17 victory in front of a rain-soaked crowd of 21,510 at Parker Stadium.  </P> <P> After its second consecutive loss dropped UCLA to 3-4 overall and 2-2 in the  Pacific 10 Conference, Coach Terry Donahue said that the Bruins were "obviously  in a rebuilding-type process."  </P> <P> Wasn't it only a year ago that UCLA was ranked No. 1?  </P> <P> "We did not expect to be 3-4," Donahue said. "Obviously, the players and  coaches and myself are really disappointed with our record and our performance  to date. Right now, our season's not good."  </P> <P> It got a lot worse with 1 minute 20 seconds left Saturday, when sophomore guard  Scott Spalding was called for holding as the Bruins attempted to position  Alfredo Velasco for a game-winning field goal.  </P> <P> UCLA, which trailed throughout the game, rallied behind reserve quarterback Jim  Bonds to open a 17-10 lead with 7:47 left, only to have Oregon State drive down  the field to score and make it 18-17.  </P> <P> Bonds rallied the Bruins again, moving them to the Beavers' 28-yard line, where  tailback Kevin Williams gained two yards through the middle.  </P> <P> But, instead of facing third-and-four at that point, UCLA faced second-and-16  because Spalding was called for holding.  </P> <P> "We had a couple of chances there to overcome the call and to do it anyway, but  we were unable to do it," Donahue said.  </P> <P> Bonds overthrew tight end Randy Austin on second down, then was belted by  defensive end Pellom McDaniels and cornerback Torey Overstreet on third down.  The ball fell harmlessly to the ground, an incomplete pass.  </P> <P> Velasco was called upon for a 55-yard field-goal attempt, which fell short of  the soon-to-be uprooted south goalpost.  </P> <P> "The (holding) penalty was the whole ballgame," Oregon State Coach Dave  Kragthorpe said. "Without it, he makes the kick."  </P> <P> Spalding, fighting back tears, declined to comment.  </P> <P> The call "influenced the game dramatically," said Donahue, who seemed to  question the timing of it.  </P> <P> "There's holding that goes on every single play," said Donahue, a former Bruin  defensive lineman. "If you get too sloppy with your hands and too free with  your hands, they're going to call it.  </P> <P> "I'm assuming he got too sloppy or free with his hands."  </P> <P> If the officials hadn't made the call, Donahue said, "we'd be talking about a  hell of a UCLA comeback."  </P> <P> Forgotten, perhaps, would be Oregon State's surprisingly easy drive to the  game-winning points.  </P> <P> A fumble by quarterback Matt Booher, who had the ball knocked out of his hands  by linebacker Craig Davis, set up a 19-yard drive by UCLA that resulted in a  two-yard touchdown run by Williams.  </P> <P> Williams swept around the left end and trotted into the end zone after a block  by fullback Mark Estwick cut down linebacker Todd McKinney, who was knocked  head over heels and had to be helped off the field.  </P> <P> Ahead at that point, 15-10, the Bruins went for two points and Bonds rifled a  pass to tight end Corwin Anthony in the right corner of the end zone.  </P> <P> But, as has been the case so often this season, the Bruins were not up to the  task that awaited them in the game's most crucial moments.  </P> <P> Booher, who completed 13 of 24 passes for 145 yards and directed an offense  that generated 284 total yards to UCLA's 266, was perfect on his last five  passes, including a 16-yard pass to Jason Kent on third-and-eight at Oregon  State's 35-yard line, which got the winning drive moving.  </P> <P> UCLA blitzed when the Beavers faced second-and-seven at the Bruins' 24, but  Oregon State picked it up and Kent, facing man-to-man coverage, worked himself  free behind cornerback Carlton Gray and Booher found him.  </P> <P> "He just beat me," Gray said of Kent. "There's really no excuse. Sometimes it  happens."  </P> <P> The 23-yard pass put the Beavers at the one-yard line.  </P> <P> Chaffey, who ran for a career-high 118 yards and two touchdowns in 27 carries,  scored on the next play to make it 17-16.  </P> <P> "They went right through us and I can't tell you why," Donahue said of the  Beavers' 67-yard game-winning drive. "It's kind of the nature of our football  team this year.  </P> <P> "When we've had to play great defense to stop them, we've been unable to, and  when we've had to play great offense to score, we've been unable to."  </P> <P> The worst, though, was yet to come for the Bruins.  </P> <P> On the two-point conversion attempt that followed, Reggie Pitchford drifted out  of the backfield and no Bruin defender picked him up.  </P> <P> Booher lofted the ball to him in the end zone.  </P> <P> Oregon State aligned two wideouts to the left and they slanted inside, clearing  the left flat for Pitchford.  </P> <P> "We didn't get lined up in time," Donahue said. "It looked like our defensive  backs were just really slow getting lined up on the overloaded play and we  never got it covered properly.  </P> <P> "The guy was so wide open, it was a joke."  </P> <P> It was no joke that, when the gun sounded 3 1/2 minutes later, Oregon State had  improved to 3-3-1, its best record at this stage of the season since 1968.  </P> <P> "I consider this the greatest win since I've been at OSU," said Kragthorpe, who  arrived from Idaho State in 1985.  </P> <P> The game began under dark skies and in a heavy downpour and Oregon State took  advantage of the first of four first-quarter turnovers, opening an early 7-0  lead after nose tackle Esera Tuaolo ripped through the Bruin line and knocked  the ball loose from quarterback Bret Johnson.  </P> <P> Defensive tackle Mike Maggiore recovered at UCLA's 18-yard line and, two plays  later, Chaffey scored his first touchdown on a 10-yard run, bursting through  the right side and veering toward the outside.  </P> <P> Velasco was wide to the right on a 40-yard field-goal attempt midway through  the quarter, but a fumble recovery by Dion Lambert, who fell on the ball after  Davis jarred it loose from tailback Jerrell Waddell, set up a 26-yard field  goal by UCLA's senior kicker only a few minutes later.  </P> <P> UCLA produced only another field goal through the first 30 minutes and, with  the Bruins trailing at halftime, 10-6.  </P></p>

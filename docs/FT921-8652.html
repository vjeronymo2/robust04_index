			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / Australian Bonds: Government spending plans raise concern THE AUSTRALIAN govern-ment has become preoccupied with its forthcoming economic statement, due on February 26. Most expect a fiscal stimulus from Mr Paul Keating's Labour government; the exact details will determine the market's direction in the coming months. The government is under considerable pressure to reduce unemployment and stimulate the recession-hit economy - especially with an election due by the middle of next year. Dealers and investors are waiting to see whether the government will announce a spending package, whether these measures will be inflationary, and if further interest rate cuts are on the cards. Australia was one of the top-performing government bond markets in 1991, helped by steadily falling interest rates. At the beginning of 1992, the overnight market rate was 7.5 per cent, compared with 12 per cent a year earlier. However, since the beginning of 1992, bond prices have fallen. Overseas investors, who made considerable gains in 1991, decided the time had come to take profits, and US-dollar based investors in particular were keen to switch out of Australian dollar assets because of fears the Australian currency would weaken from a level of around 77 cents to the US dollar. The result was a sharp sell-off in the Australian debt market. The yield on the 10 per cent bond due October 2002 rose from 9.3 per cent on January 7 to 10.3 per cent by January 31. The Australian dollar had dipped below 74 cents to the US dollar, although it subsequently recovered and at the end of last week it was quoted at around 75.4 cents. The economic statement is expected to include measures aimed at reducing unemployment, which rose to a post-war high of 10.6 per cent of the workforce in December 1991. Although the unemployment figures for January (released last week) were much better than expected, analysts warn that January figures are not always a reliable guide and should be treated with some caution. The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate fell to 10.3 per cent and employment rose by 46,900 in January, whereas economists had expected unemployment to be unchanged or even slightly higher, while employment was expected to rise. Bond yields rose on the news as hopes of an easing in monetary policy subsided. Mr Ralph Willis, finance minister, tried to reassure the financial markets last Friday that the government remained committed to keeping inflation relatively low, even if it boosts spending. But the concern in the market is that a substantial increase in spending would force the government to borrow heavily in the bond market and that the resulting new supply would push bond prices lower. At the tender of government stock on February 11, a total of ADollars 800m was sold, consisting of ADollars 400m of the March 1994 bond and ADollars 400m of the October 2002 bond. The amount sold was slightly lower than expected, although there is probably going to be an additional tender in May. The yield on the two-year paper - which was sold at an average of 8.119 per cent at tender - is now 8.28 per cent, while for the 10-year bond, the yield has risen from 10.085 per cent at the tender to 10.17 per cent on Friday.</p>

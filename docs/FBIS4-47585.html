Komar, Central X-ray and  Radiology Scientific Research Institute at the Russian  Federation Ministry of Public Health, St. Petersburg]    [Abstract] Reports that a decrease in hereditary stability  raises the carcinogenesis risk and that irradiation destabilizes  the hereditary chromosomal system and, in a long-term, increases  the cells' sensitivity to mutagenic factors, and evidence that a  human organism irradiated at the parental gamete stages becomes  postnatally more sensitive to subsequent mutagenic and  carcinogenic factors prompted a comparative investigation of the  stability of the chromosomal system of the Chernobyl clean-up  crew children in order to predict their likely mutagenesis and  carcinogenesis risk. To this end, a cytogenetic examination of  several groups of children from the St. Petersburg region  irradiated due to the Chernobyl nuclear power plant accident and  control group children was carried out. The children were  divided into seven groups: postnatal irradiation (A), evacuated  children (A') from Gomel and Bryansk oblasts, intrauterine  irradiation (B), prezygotic irradiation (C), negative control  (D), positive control (E), and clinical control (F). The  chromosomal system stability was assessed by the spontaneous  chromosomal aberration and micronuclei level in the lymphocytes  and by the chromosomal radiosensitivity under an in  vitro exposure of these cells to a 1.5 Gy dose of [.sup]60[/]  Co _g_-radiation. The findings demonstrate that  the use of the comprehensive hereditary system stability  assessment may probably produce more objective criteria for  identifying the risk groups while the use of in vitro  test irradiation may be recommended as a procedure for  evaluating the chromosomal stability. The results also make it  possible to draw the preliminary conclusion that low-dose  irradiation of children is a factor which destabilizes the human  genome.

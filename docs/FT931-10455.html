			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / International Company News: Slowdown hits French retailers THE difficulties of the French retail sector were highlighted yesterday as a number of large groups reported flat or falling turnover figures for their operations last year. BHV, the department store chain, disclosed a slight fall in sales of 2.3 per cent to FFr4.1bn (Dollars 732m) from FFr4.27bn in 1991. The Uniprix group of self-service stores reported static sales, with an increase of 2.6 per cent to FFr2.3bn. Other retail concerns, managed to maintain sales growth mainly due to recent acquisitions. Galeries Lafayette would have reported static sales without the inclusion of the Nouvelles Galeries chain which boosted group turnover by 25 per cent to FFr31.3bn. Promodes, aided by the acquisition of Plaza in Germany, saw sales rise by 10 per cent to FFr84bn. The Monoprix supermarket group increased sales by 7.4 per cent last year to FFr10.02bn. French retailers have been plunged into competitive trading due to the impact of the economic slowdown and rising unemployment on consumer confidence. Household expenditure fell in real terms last year, with growth of just 1.7 per cent against an annual inflation rate of 2.2 per cent, according to the latest analysis from Credit Lyonnais. This slowdown in consumer spending has accelerated the restructuring of French retailing. A number of French companies have made major acquisitions, including Carrefour and Casino in hypermarkets and Pinault in department stores.</p>

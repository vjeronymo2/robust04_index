			<p><P> October 24, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> VALLEY ROUNDUP: COURT LIFTS UES EXCLUSION FROM LOAN PROGRAM  </P> <P> The U.S. District Court in Los Angeles on Friday granted a temporary  restraining order preventing the California Student Aid Commission from barring  one of United Education &amp; Software's 26 trade schools from the federal  student loan program until a hearing is held Oct. 31.  </P> <P> The commission, a state agency that administers the federal student loan  guarantee program, said last week that new students enrolling at National  Technical Schools, a Los Angeles mail order school owned by the Encino-based  United Education &amp; Software, wouldn't be eligible for government-guaranteed  student loans because the school didn't meet the program's standards.  </P> <P> The court ordered National Technical Schools to post a $250,000 bond as a  condition for granting the temporary stay.  </P> <P> However, the restraining order doesn't affect a separate decision announced  Oct. 16 by the Higher Education Assistance Foundation, a private, nonprofit  agency in St. Paul, Minn., that guarantees student loans, to suspend National  Technical Schools from its loan guarantee program for a month.  </P> <P> The commission banned National Technical Schools from the loan program because  of problems uncovered during a U.S. Department of Education audit conducted  from August, 1987, to November, 1988.  </P> <P> Among other things, the audit found that the school's computer training courses  were too short to meet the federal minimum length of six months, the school  admitted academically unprepared students, and it didn't make proper refunds on  loans.  </P> <P> The federal government said earlier that United Education &amp; Software might  be liable to repay $21.8 million in government-backed student loans because of  the audit findings.  </P></p>

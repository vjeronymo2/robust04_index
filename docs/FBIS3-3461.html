			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 22 (XINHUA)-- Chinese Premier Li Peng  said here this afternoon that it has been China's consistent  position to stand for negotiations and dialogues rather than  pressure on the issue of nuclear inspection in the Democratic  People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).    Answering a question by a CNN reporter on China's stand if  the issue is submitted to the Security Council of the United  Nations, the premier said that if the method of pressure is  used, it will only make things more complicated, and make the  situation on the Korean penninsula tense, and that will not be  good for the peace and stability of the region.    "The issue of nuclear inspection in DPRK has lasted for a  long time, from disagreeing with inspection to agreeing, which  well domonstrates that anything can be resolved through  negotiations and dialogues," the premier said.    Li said that China is a signatory to the Nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty, and it will never encourage nulcear  proliferation.    The premier told Chinese and foreign reporters attending a  reception sponsored by the just-concluded National People's  Congress that if the issue of nuclear inspection in DPRK should  be submitted to the Security Council of the United Nations,  Chinese representative to the UN will put forward a  comprehensive explanation on China's position.    "I hope other member countries of the U.N. Security Council  will accept China's position," the premier concluded.</p>

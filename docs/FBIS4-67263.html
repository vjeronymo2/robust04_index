			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Commentary by Claudio Picasso Ardito: "Drug Trafficking vs </F> Nicaragua"]    [Text] The U.S. State Department's most recent  report on drug trafficking and money laundering in Central  America generated a wave of protest from officials in our  government. The State Department document tells us that drug  trafficking and money laundering have increased from 1993 to  1994, and it specifically names Guatemala, Panama, Costa Rica,  and Honduras. With respect to Nicaragua, it states that our  country has been slow to pass laws punishing such crimes and  does not provide adequate financial support for law enforcement  agencies.    Reports by such agencies as the DEA [Drug Enforcement  Administration], U.S. Customs, the Financial Crime Enforcement  Network, and others in 1992 and 1993 contain a stockpile of  information on financial movements and trafficking in harmful  substances. Indeed, the report sounds the alarm for Nicaragua.    Let us look at the facts. Our brand-new commissions seem to  be unaware of achievements in certain areas. We are specifically  referring to money laundering, concerning which we can state  that in Nicaragua, the Central Bank efficiently controls  exchange banks and other authorized agents. In addition, at a  meeting held on 25 January 1993 in the offices of the Treasury  Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission in  Washington, D.C., it was clearly stated that Nicaragua is not  among the countries where this type of crime occurs. A  memorandum from the BCN [Central Bank of Nicaragua] even  reflects this information. The Superintendency of Banking has  also instituted efficient control barriers in our commercial  banks that render money laundering more difficult.    Nevertheless, we cannot say that money laundering does not  take place. We must remember that criminal organizations have  efficient financial systems and that if they do operate, it must  be as discreetly as possible, conducting their dealings through  the uncontrolled commercial underworld that exists in our  country and paving the way for consolidation. We must be clear  about this and not engage in speculative, puritanical statements.  <H5>  Plans </H5>   The level of drug use in our country has risen from 1990 to  1994 with respect to Cannabis sativa (marijuana), cocaine,  amphetamines, and tranquillizers. The increase among young  people is alarming. There must be no attempt to cover this up  and Commander Caldera of the National Police has warned of the  emerging danger on several occasions. Now can we blame the  Police for their failure to act because we are all aware of the  limited budget available and the red tape of officials in a  certain "ministry" that results in operational delays? In the  meantime, the figures continue to rise noticeably, as we can see  in our daily newspapers and health reports.    Drugs have now made their way into Nicaragua. How do they  get  here and from where? What is the reason for the increase? We all  know that we are surrounded by countries where the transshipment  and laundering of money is blatant. We are a logical target.    We must simply recognize the facts, without euphemisms or  underestimating the problem. Rising poverty is a hotbed to be  used by drug traffickers, combined with legal confusion and a  lack of restrictive criminal laws, an absence of government  control over mind-altering substances and of adequate mechanisms  to reduce the availability of dangerous substances, along with a  lack of (modern) measures regulating the purchase and  distribution of drugs for medical use. Let us be realistic: It  is not that we can make a country free of drugs, but we can make  a country opposed to drugs that is difficult for organized crime  to penetrate.  <H5>  Education and Legal and Police Measures </H5>   The measures are simple but costly, and the investment  required is enormous in terms of human and economic interests.  It must initially include the following:    1) providing an efficient budget for the National Police to  be used to improve techniques and modernize means so as to  create an antidrug atmosphere; drafting legal guidelines for  speed in operations (functionalality); expanding the range of  action and equipment of the Economic Department; modernizing the  crime lab in order to bring it in line with world investigative  requirements and guidelines; and (Please!) raising the wages of  our policemen (they are the ones dying because of our apathy);    2) drafting efficient laws for the fight against drug  trafficking and money laundering, not parodies or copies from  some other jurisdiction, but laws covering summary action and  harsh sanctions; regulating and giving the force of law to  police evidence in such crimes;    3) organizing the legal system to make it more workable;    4) setting up an office to oversee the control, uses, and  effects of substances and to govern their importation,  production, and distribution;    5) regulating the seizure of drugs, equipment, and dirty  money from drug traffickers (saving the government budget  millions) because we still have obsolete laws on the books in  our country;    6) establishing intergovernmental and police cooperation  with  specialized agencies via cooperation agreements; and    7) promoting education campaigns in our schools. The danger  is latent and the message is reaching us from all sides. Our  officials must realize that drugs are destroying entire  societies today, and we cannot prevent this from happening by  rhetoric alone.</p>

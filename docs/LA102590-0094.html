			<p><P> October 25, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TENNIS ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> KULTI EARNS BIGGEST UPSET, BEATING AGASSI, 6-3, 7-5  </P> <P> Nicklas Kulti, the 1989 world junior champion, earned the biggest victory of  his short career Wednesday, upsetting third-seeded Andre Agassi, 6-3, 7-5, in  the second round of the Stockholm Open.  </P> <P> "I played incredibly well, especially on my backhand," said Kulti, a  19-year-old Swede ranked 76th in the world. "But I don't think he played 100%."  </P> <P> Agassi, a finalist in both the French and U.S. Opens this year, did not. He was  playing his first match in three weeks after straining his lower back in early  October.  </P> <P> "I was not as prepared as I could have been," said Agassi, ranked fourth in the  world. "I was hoping to get through the early matches to get into the groove.  But that's expecting a lot when you haven't played a lot.  </P> <P> "I'm disappointed, but he beat me fair and square."  </P> <P> Stefan Edberg, the world's top-ranked player, rallied from a slow start to beat  Mats Wilander, 6-4, 6-3. Boris Becker, No. 2 seeded, dropped only two games,  but John McEnroe was extended to three sets in other second-round matches.  </P> <P> Wilander, meeting Edberg for the first time since losing to him in the  Australian Open semifinals in January, raced to a 4-1 lead in the first set.  </P> <P> But Edberg was only one service break down and "I was never really worried,  although I was a little bit nervous early on," he said.  </P> <P> Becker, the 1988 champion from Germany, defeated Darren Cahill of Australia,  6-2, 6-0, winning 10 consecutive points to pull away from 2-2 in the opening  set.  </P> <P> McEnroe, playing in Stockholm for the first time since 1985 -- when he won a  record fourth singles title -- beat Karel Novacek, 6-2, 6-7 (3-7), 7-5.  </P> <P> McEnroe said he didn't lose concentration in the second set.  </P> <P> "I basically choked," he said. "He picked up on my serve and guessed pretty  well. His confidence picked up and suddenly it was a totally different match."  </P> <P> Steffi Graf advanced to the quarterfinals of the Brighton, England, WITA  tournament with a 6-4, 6-2 victory over Nathalie Herreman of France.  </P> <P> In other second-round play, second-seeded Katerina Maleeva of Bulgaria beat  British qualifier Kaye Hand, 6-2, 6-2, and sixth-seeded Sandra Cecchini of  Italy ousted Sandra Dopfer of Austria, 7-6 (7-2), 6-3.  </P> <P> In first-round matches, third-seeded Helena Sukova of Czechoslovakia defeated  Soviet player Viktoria Milvidskaia, 6-4, 7-6 (7-5), and fifth-seeded Nathalie  Tauziat of France overwhelmed Britain's Sarah Loosemore, 6-1, 6-2.  </P> <P> Unseeded Florencia Labat used a strong baseline game to oust fifth-seeded  Raffaela Reggi, 4-6, 6-4, 7-6 (7-4), for the second upset in two days at the  $150,000 Puerto Rico Open at San Juan.  </P> <P> Third-seeded Amy Frazier had fallen to South African Elna Reinach Tuesday  night.  </P> <P> In first-round matches, top-seeded Zina Garrison struggled to a 6-3, 7-5 win  over Bulgarian Elena Pampoulova; No. 4 Helen Kelesi of Canada beat American  Camille Benjamin, 6-4, 6-1, and Meredith McGrath topped Soviet Natalia  Medvedeva, 7-5, 6-4.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By corrrespondent Chen Guangman (7115 0342 2581): ``Public </F> Health Minister on Drug Abuse in Our Country'']    [Text] Beijing, 13 Dec -- In recent years, there have been  frequent incidences of the abuse of imported and expensive  drugs, steroids, painkillers, tranquilizers, and antibiotics in  our country, according to a convention today inaugurating the  Chinese Society for the Prevention and Treatment of Drug Abuse.  Therefore, it is a matter of great urgency to begin the  prevention and treatment of drug abuse in our country.    According to the convention, drug abuse is a social problem  that endangers public health and is one which faces the  international community. The WHO lists drug abuse as the abuse  of anesthetics, medicines for psychiatric treatment, tobacco,  alcohol, and dissolvable organic substances. In our country,  there is close government and nongovernment attention to the  abuse of alcohol and tobacco and their hazards. But problems  such as the abuse of non- anesthetic drugs and treatment with  addictive pain-killers have not yet received wide attention. A  poll of 1,822 households in the Beijing urban area in 1988 found  that the drug- dependency rate originating from the abuse of  prescribed medicines was 0.309 percent of those polled, half the  drugs they depended upon were, on the whole, fever medications.  Another special poll of 4,139 medical workers in 10 city and  district hospitals in Beijing toward the end of 1989 reported  that of the 96 drug dependents, 76, that is 79.2 percent, were  on sleeping pills and sedatives. Investigations by the  departments concerned show that middle-aged and young people  account for the majority of the 250,000 drug addicts in our  country, concentrations of whom extend from the Yunnan borders  to Guizhou, Sichuan, Gansu, Shaanxi, and Guangxi, involving some  700 counties in 17 provinces, cities, and autonomous regions.  Statistics from the Public Health Ministry's AIDS Monitoring  Center show that by November 1993, 60 percent of the nation's  HIV carriers became infected by injecting heroin intravenously.    Public Health Minister Chen Minzhang said in his address  that  anesthetics and psychiatric medicines are indispensable in  medical work and, properly administered, ease pain and protect  health. But, if they are abused or illegally manufactured and  sold, they become poisonous drugs and cause harm. He therefore  stressed that in preventing and treating drug abuse, we must  learn from countries around the world about their successes in  combating drugs. It is hoped that the newly founded Chinese  Society for the Prevention and Treatment of Drug Abuse will,  under the centralized leadership of governments at all levels,  launch mass prevention and treatment; mobilize circles in  society to campaign widely and educate people against drug  abuse, targeting the effort above all at adolescents and youths;  work in coordination with the government departments concerned  to prevent drug abuse; and work for the health of our country's  people.</p>

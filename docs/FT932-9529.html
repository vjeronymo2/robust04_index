			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / GPA Group - The Refinancing: Manoeuvring and intrigue in battle for control - The board's loyalty to founder Tony Ryan quashed the middle managers' coup attempt SOME OF GPA Group's executives have likened the political infighting going on at their Shannon headquarters in the Irish republic to a Shakespearean drama. 'There has been so much manoeuvring and intrigue at the top,' said one of the group's advisers, 'that I am sometimes surprised that the executives have any time for the restructuring at all.' The wrangling came to a head recently when the middle management launched a putsch to have Mr Tony Ryan, the group's founder, replaced as chairman by Mr Gerald Greenwald, a non-executive director and key figure in rescues as diverse as Chrysler and Olympia &amp; York. The coup failed when the board rallied behind Mr Ryan. But the fight over GPA's top job is by no means over. Some of the group's biggest lenders have been concerned for several months that a gulf has developed between middle management, which is effectively running the operations, and senior directors involved in the restructuring, which to date has failed to meet most of its object- ives. Angry about the lack of progress on the restructuring, two key middle managers, Mr Patrick Blaney and Mr Phil Bolger, wrote to the board asking for Mr Ryan to be replaced by Mr Greenwald. However, the rest of the non-executive directors, who include Sir John Harvey-Jones, the former chairman of Imperial Chemical Industries, Lord Lawson, the former UK chancellor of the exchequer, and Mr Garret FitzGerald, the former Irish Prime Minister, gave their unequivocal support to Mr Ryan. Three of the non-executives were already on record as citing Mr Ryan as the main reason why they joined the board and they were not about to let him down when he needed help. As one of the non-executives put it: 'We are all very close to Mr Ryan, who has been doing a splendid job in very difficult circumstances. We did not entertain the thought of replacing him: there will be no more management changes.' In the event, Mr Blaney was promoted to the board as chief operating office in charge of the restructuring, named Project Rebound. Other members of middle management had already moved into key positions. These include Mr Bolger, who is in charge of leasing, Mr Mike Dolan, responsible for the negotiations with bondholders as managing director of GPA Capital, and Mr Steve Johnson, who is the company's general council. According to one banker the four 'young turks' no longer have confidence in Mr Ryan's leadership. He believes they will resume their battle for control of the company even if a refinancing is completed. But it would be a mistake to write-off Mr Ryan. A deal with GE Capital would have the effect of strengthening his position as chairman. Mr Gary Wendt, chief executive of GE Capital, has assured Mr Ryan of his continued support should the financial services arm of General Electric take up a stake in GPA. Nor is Mr Ryan adverse to making sudden board changes to strengthen his hand. Last September he surprised some of his directors when he abruptly took over as chief executive from Mr Maurice Foley. There has been speculation that Mr Ryan may be willing to accept an honorary post such as life president. But Ireland's best-known entrepreneur is unlikely to go in the immediate future unless he is pushed.</p>

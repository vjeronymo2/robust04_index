He added  that he hoped the countries will manage to do this.    Setting up a common Baltic peacekeeping battalion was one of  the topics discussed at a meeting in Stockholm Tuesday [8 March]  between Laar, his Latvian counterpart Valdis Birkavs and  Lithuanian Defense Minister Linas Linkevicius.    "It seems that the Nordic countries are ready to help the  Baltics in the formation of the battalion in every possible way,  including training. We from our side try to find out how  peacekeeping battalions were created in the Nordic countries and  what their structure is," Laar said.    The head of Lithuania's defense forces, Gen. Jonas  Andriskevicius, said Tuesday that lawyers at his central staff  are currently working on the legal basis for the peacekeeping  battalion. He said soldiers for the common battalion are to be  trained at a base in Alytus, southern Lithuania. The general  said a former Soviet paratrooper units base there was offering  excellent conditions for training the staff of the new force.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by State President F.W. de Klerk on the SAPA PR </F> wire service on 16 February]    [Text] The government and the National Party [NP] have,  over the past weeks, done everything in their power to make an  inclusive negotiated settlement possible. Various proposals and  counter-proposals were tabled in the process. This led to the  government's negotiating team making a proposal on 2 February  this year which, in our opinion, could resolve the deadlock.    The ANC [African National Congress] has now dropped its  opposition to important aspects of this proposal and we believe  that this offers the opportunity to all parties, including the  Freedom Alliance [FA] parties, to participate in the elections.  In particular, the proposal addresses two matters which were of  key importance to the parties of the Freedom Alliance, namely a  constitutional principle which makes provision for  self-determination and a related mechanism which gives further  attention to the idea of a "volkstaat" [Afrikaner homeland] and  a constitutional principle which provides that the powers and  capabilities of the provinces will in essence be maintained.  All the other matters are, however, also of crucial importance.    The road to peaceful participation in the election is, in  our  opinion, now open to all parties and the government expresses  its hope that the Freedom Alliance will now place the interests  of South Africa and of its own voters first.</p>

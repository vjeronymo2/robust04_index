			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / Return to apprentice system supported A MAJORITY of companies in north-east England would like to see a return to apprenticeship-style training, a survey for Tyneside Training and Enterprise Council has found, Lisa Wood writes. A study by North Tyneside Brass Tacks, a provider of training to the Tec, says that 59 per cent of the 300 companies questioned were in favour of returning to job-specific and time-served training. Critics of the old apprentice system claim it was rigid and nurtured prejudices about skills and how they should be taught. Apprenticeships, they said, had become too closely identified with restrictive craft practices, in particular the strict demarcation of work. But increasing numbers of companies are expressing interest in returning to apprenticeships - usually lasting three years. Youth Training, the government-funded scheme, lasts two years and many employers believe it is impossible to get to required craft levels in this time. Tyneside Tec, along with training providers, including the local Engineering Training Authority, is investigating the possibility of a three-year apprenticeship programme in which the Tec might give employers matching funds for the third year.</p>

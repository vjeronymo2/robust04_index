			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets: S Africa ends broadly lower Johannesburg ended broadly lower as initial losses in golds and other mining shares spread to the broader market amid a lack of fresh direction and limited buying support. The overall index, after edging higher at the start, finished 63 down at 5,892, while golds lost 45 at 2,419 and industrials dipped 22 to 6,595. Traders said short term equity index futures, which close out on Thursday, were calling golds slightly better but were discounting a fall in the industrial and overall indices. The newly listed Nasionale Pers added R2 at R21 - sharply above expectations which were as low as R17 - in heavy volume of R115m. Iscor lost 12 cents at R4.58 as profits continued to be taken after recent gains.</p>

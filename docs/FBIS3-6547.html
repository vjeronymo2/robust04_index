			<p>Article Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Tokyo YOMIURI SHIMBUN in Japanese, on  page 5 of its 8 March, 9 March, 10 March, 11 March, and 12 March  morning editions, carries a five-part series entitled "Is the  Japanese Market Open?" with each article averaging approximately  1,000 words.    The first article on 8 March, an unattributed piece  subtitled  "Automobile and Auto Parts -- Reasons American-Built Automobiles  Are Not Sold In Japan and the Gap Between Japan and the United  States," deals with Japan-U.S. friction over automobiles and  auto parts.    Noting that the U.S. Government has decided to revive the  Super 301 provision of the 1988 Omnibus Trade Act, thus  heightening Japan-U.S. trade frictions, the article states it  has looked into the actual situation of the "closed Japanese  market" pointed out by the United States.    The article cites remarks by Harold Poling, chairman of Ford  Motor Company: "In the balance of trade between Japan and the  United States, the ratio of automobile and auto parts is  overwhelmingly great; it is necessary to take decisive and  concrete action to address the imbalance in the trade of  automobile and auto parts between the two countries." The  article adds the "trade imbalance between Japan and the United  States in the automobile and auto parts sector is certainly  great."    Stating that last year Japan exported $23.77 billion worth  of  automobiles to the United States, accounting for 21.9 percent of  its total exports to that country, while importing $1.125  billion worth of American-built automobiles, the article points  out that "Japan's imports of American-built cars in 1993 were  merely 2.0 percent of the total imports from that country."    The article continues by saying that as examples of the  closure of the Japanese market, the Big Three cite: "1) the  clear existence of dealer keiretsu [interlocking corporate  grouping] and traditionally exclusionist business practices; 2)  Japan's peculiar stereotyped certification system; and 3) the  imposition of various discriminatory taxes on large automobiles  as well as the pervasiveness of closed deals, with the  importance placed on keiretsu." The article adds "Japanese auto  manufacturers also complain about the complexity of Japan's  standard for certification."    The article states that Japanese auto manufacturers refute  their complaints, claiming: "In Japan, they can freely obtain  their dealership in principle; it is good if they organize their  own sales networks in Japan as we have done in other nations.  The standard for certification and the tax system are common in  Japan, the United States, and Europe. The share of  European-built cars is about 4 percent in Japan and the United  States, and that percentage has not changed greatly. This is  evidence there is no difference between the openness of the  Japanese and American auto markets."    As reasons why American-built automobiles are not sold in  Japan, the article cites the following: "1) Approximately 80  percent of automobiles are sold for less than 3 million yen on  the Japanese market. They are small automobiles with an engine  displacement of less than 2,000CC [cubic centimeters], while  most American-built cars are highly-priced large automobiles  with an engine displacement of 3,000CC; 2) Most European-built  automobiles are right-hand drive, but only a few American-built  automobiles are right-hand drive; and 3) European auto  manufacturers have spent heavily on the construction of their  own car inspection centers before exporting their automobiles,  but American auto manufacturers have made little efforts to that  end." The article also points out: "While the defective rate  of Japanese-made auto parts is three or five in one million,  that of American-made auto parts is 250 in one million. American  auto-parts manufacturers have failed to meet the supply date on  many occasions."    Noting that efforts on both sides have little by little  generated the effect of addressing the imbalance, and that it is  certain the imbalance has begun addressing itself, the article  states: "Both Japan and the United States are urged to  accumulate sober efforts instead of being locked in emotional  confrontations."    The second article on 9 March, an unattributed piece  subtitled "Telecommunications Equipment -- The U.S. Demands  Guaranteed Results," discusses Japan-U.S. friction over  telecommunications equipment.    Stating that final negotiations on the issue of opening the  Japanese mobile phone market are being held between Japan and  the United States, the article notes the wide differences  between the two countries over the interpretation of the term  "equal market access" which is incorporated into the preamble of  the 1989 Japan-U.S. Telecommunications Agreement.    Discussing the differences, the article says while the U.S.  trade representative claims "the Motorola-type mobile phone  operation is not given the same market access to relay stations  as the NTT [Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation]-type  mobile phone operation enjoys, the Post and Telecommunications  Ministry [PTM] contends `equal market access' refers only to a  general theory. The Japan Mobile Communications Corporation  [known as IDO] has assigned frequencies to the Motorola-type  mobile phone operation. What remains to be done regards the  question of business, and the government cannot intervene in  business." The article also notes that the construction of  relay stations for the Motorola-type mobile phone operation lags  behind that of relay stations for the NTT-type mobile phone  operation. While the NTT-type mobile phone operation have  310,000 subscribers, the Motorola-type mobile phone operation  has a little over 10,000 subscribers, triggering fresh friction  between Japan and the United States over the share of the  Motorola-type mobile phone operation in the Japanese mobile  phone market.    The article states that in bilateral negotiations on  government procurement under the Japan-U.S. economic framework  talks, the United States asked Japan to make NTT subject to the  accord on the government procurement, with the "apparent aim of  opening the way for a result-based orientation which is aimed at  raising the share of foreign goods on the Japanese market to the  level of foreign goods in the rest of the G-7 markets."    A senior PTM official states: "Moves by the United States  are aimed at expanding its access to the Japanese market in the  high-tech sector--in which it has the upper hand--by driving a  wedge in the Japan telecommunications market which is expected  to rapidly grow in the multimedia age."    The article adds: "Japan is denying U.S. charges that the  Japanese market is closed, citing the growing number of  telecommunications companies in which foreign firms hold more  than 20 percent of their capital." It goes on to concede:  "There are many regulations in the Japanese telecommunications  market, and this makes it hard to freely engage in the  telecommunications business in Japan. Japanese manufacturers  also are complaining about the situation." A major commercial  electric appliance manufacturer is quoted as saying: "It is  urgent for Japan to relax these regulations in order to avert  trade friction with its trade partners and to bolster Japan's  international competitiveness."    Stressing that if Japan fails to keep its regulations from  hindering the development of telecommunications technology, it  will be criticized for keeping its telecommunications market  closed and for crippling Japan's future high technology.    The third article on 10 March, an unattributed piece  subtitled "The Government Procurement of Supercomputers -- The  United States Still Distrusts Japan's Reform of Tender System,"  views Japan-U.S. friction over government procurements.    After a review by the Information Center at Tsukuba  University on the disputes between Japan and the United States  over the bidding for supercomputers, the article states: "The  Japanese Government's procurement of supercomputers has become a  symbol of high-tech friction between Japan and the United  States."    Stating that the government has already decided in this  year's supplementary budget to procure 11 supercomputers--six  American-built and five Japanese-built supercomputers--through  biddings, the article notes that "so far 80 percent of the  government's procurement of supercomputers has been  Japanese-built." By the government procuring six American-built  supercomputers, the United States feels that "given our  technological power, it is a matter of course for the Japanese  Government to procure our supercomputers."    Discussing the dispute between Japan and the United States  over the Japanese Government's procurement of supercomputers,  the article states: "While the United States thinks the  Japanese Government attaches importance to prices in its  procurement of supercomputers and gives Japanese firms  information on biddings, Japan contends that American  supercomputer manufacturers are unable to gain access to Japan's  supercomputer market because of the high competitiveness held by  Japanese supercomputer manufacturers." It adds that American  supercomputer manufacturers, who control more than 60 percent of  the world market, have complained about their inability to  display their competitiveness in the Japanese supercomputer  market. Michiro Naruto, assistant director of Fujitsu Ltd, is  quoted as saying: "Foreign-built supercomputers have been kept  out of the U.S. Government procurement market for security  reasons. Not a single Japanese-built supercomputer has been  sold on the market."    The article further states that despite Japan's amendment of  procedures for government procurement of supercomputers, as well  as its adoption of a comprehensive appraisal system, the United  States still complains about the way the Japanese Government  procures supercomputers. Pointing out that in testimony before  Congress on 8 March, U.S. Trade Representative Kantor cited  supercomputers as an item indicative of the closure of the  Japanese market, hinting at the possibility of the United States  applying the Super 301 provision to supercomputers, the article  responds by saying the United States points to the  incompleteness of Japanese reform regarding the way the  government procures supercomputers; dumping by Japanese  supercomputer manufacturers still remains unchanged. It says:  "Japanese supercomputer manufacturers acknowledge dumping."    Also stressed is the fact that the "Japan-U.S. friction over  the Japanese Government's procurement of supercomputers stems  not from the lack of transparency of the tender system, but from  the differences between Japanese and American management style."  It notes that "it has become difficult for the two countries to  find clues to defusing their friction."    The fourth article on 11 March, an unattributed piece  subtitled "Plate Glass Products -- After-Contract Discount  Abolished," deals with the friction between Japan and the United  States over plate glass products.    Noting that "three major Japanese glass manufacturers--Asahi  Glass Company, Nippon Sheet Glass Company, and Central Glass  Company--control about 90 percent of the Japanese glass market,  and that the ratio of imported glass on the market is less than  10 percent," the article says the United States has continued to  criticize Japan, claiming that "special agents, the pervasive  keiretsu in distribution channels, and the lack of transparency  of business practices in Japan have kept foreign-made glass out  of the Japan's glass market."    Reporting that the three major Japanese glass manufacturers  have announced plans not to comply with any demands from  construction firms for after-contract discounts [a business  practice under which glass manufacturers comply with demands  from construction firms for discounting glass prices from their  purchase contracts after they complete the construction of their  buildings] in a bid to increase the lack of transparency of  glass prices, the article stresses that the "three major  Japanese glass manufacturers have abolished after-contract  discounts so American firms can easily understand competition in  Japan." Yasuhiko Furukawa, assistant director of Asahi Glass  Company, is quoted as saying: "Japanese glass manufacturers  have done what is necessary to open the Japanese glass market.  What remains to be done is for American firms to make the  effort."    A survey by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry  shows "three-fourth of glass wholesalers that do not deal in  imported glass have never received offers from foreign glass  makers."    The article adds: "It is true that in Japan importance is  placed on long-term, stable deals."    Touching on Japan-U.S. friction over paper products, Toru  Yoshino, managing director of Shinoshi Paper Company, is quoted  as saying: "American corporations have failed to properly deal  with port strikes, and poorly respond to the Japanese market as  regards aspects of supply." The article notes: "It would be  very difficult for both Japan and the United States to find  areas of agreement to settle their friction over paper products."    The fifth and final article on 12 March, an unattributed  piece subtitled "Insurance -- Japan Is In the Red," details  Japan-U.S. friction over insurance.    Noting that insurance is a sector in which Japan runs a  large  deficit with the United States, the article cites 1990 U.S.  statistics showing that while Japan paid the United States $583  million in insurance transactions, the United States paid Japan  $156 million. The question is raised of why the insurance  sector became a priority sector for discussion in the Japan-U.S.  economic framework talks.    An unnamed official in an insurance firm is quoted as  saying:  "A major American insurance group, which has a close  relationship with President Clinton, has lobbied the U.S.  Government. The American Insurance Group is the only American  insurance corporation unhappy with the Japanese Government."    The article notes that in his testimony before Congress,  Josef Molay [name as published], representative of the U.S.  Insurance Association, touched on the closure of the Japanese  insurance market, stressing: "The American financial service  sector is the fastest growing sector. It maintains 77 percent  of its workers on the job, and creates 90 percent of new jobs,  while generating 70 percent of the gross domestic production  (GDP). The sector also accounts for one-third of U.S. exports."    Against the backdrop of its competitiveness, the United  States stuck to the last to its demand for holding negotiations  on the financial service sector in the Uruguay Round.    Pointing out that the United States has highly appraised  Japan for working for an amendment to the Insurance Business Law  and for relaxing regulations, the article states: "It is true  the government's full protection and use of keiretsu by Japanese  insurance companies for their insurance transactions are major  barriers for foreign-affiliated insurance companies in Japan."    A government source is quoted as saying: "With the exception  of the numerical targets issue, the two nations can strike a  deal in the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks." The article  adds: "The United States views the Japanese market as closed  and not transparent. This is one of reasons for the United  States' sticking to its demand for numerical targets." The  article concludes by saying Japan is reacting against the U.S.  view, asserting that "the Japanese insurance market is open, and  there are many problems with the U.S. insurance market."</p>

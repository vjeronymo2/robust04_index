			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / People: Audit watchdog appointments anger councils The latest two appointments to the Audit Commission have put noses out of joint among local authorities. The two appointees - Sir Peter Kemp, formerly second permanent secretary at the Cabinet Office, and Kate Jenkins, who was head of the prime minister's efficiency unit from 1986 to 1989 - have distinguished governmental careers behind them but neither comes from local government. The Labour-controlled Association of Metropolitan Authorities argued against the appointments when it was consulted. A spokesman said: 'We are not happy about this. People with experience of local government are under-represented.' The number of commissioners on the statutory local government watchdog has recently been enlarged to 18. However, only five have local experience, according to the AMA - the same number as in 1991, when there were 14 commissioners. Both appointments are effective from today for a term of three years. They were made jointly by the environment secretary, John Gummer, the Welsh secretary, John Redwood, and the health secretary, Virginia Bottomley. Accountancy professions, employers' organisations and trade unions were also consulted.</p>

			<p><P> October 11, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHANCELLOR  </P> <P> On Dec. 15, trustees of North Orange County Community College District will be  selecting a permanent chancellor who will oversee the Fullerton and Cypress  College campuses.  </P> <P> Considering that the surrounding communities of those two colleges are  populated overwhelmingly by Latinos, trustees should consider someone who will  reflect that population.  </P> <P> Assembly Bill 1725 mandates that school districts with a high percentage of  minority students also have on its faculty, staff and administrative personnel  reflecting that population.  </P> <P> The Board of Trustees would be sending a hopeful message to Latino constituents  by select-ing Latinos to lead the college district.  </P> <P> Furthermore, the trustees would avoid more lawsuits from civil rights  organizations namely, Los Amigos of Orange County, Mexican American Legal  Defense Fund, League of United Latin Americans, GI Forum and many others.  </P> <P> JAIME B.

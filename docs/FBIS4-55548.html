			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Petan"-signed interview with Gabor Kuncze, prime </F> ministerial candidate for the Alliance of Free Democrats, SZDSZ;  place and date not given: "Privatization Cannot Be Stopped --  The SZDSZ Faces a Crossroads -- Interview With Gabor Kuncze"]    [Text] We are continuing our series that was started  before the first round of the elections. This time we interview  Gabor Kuncze, prime ministerial candidate of the Alliance of  Free Democrats [SZDSZ]. As is known, the Free Democrats  received 19.74 percent of the votes in the 8 May elections and  remain in contention in second place.    [UJ MAGYARORSZAG] Preparing for the second round of the  elections, you keep emphasizing that you do not wish to change  the tone of your campaign. However, you would like to throw  light on the differences between the programs of the Socialists  and the Free Democrats. In your view, what are the main  differences?    [Kuncze] We primarily start from the premise that only a  liberal economic policy can find a way out of the current state  of the country's economy. This means a strict budget austerity  policy on one side and tax reductions and tax allowances to  stimulate investment on the other. Conditions for growth have  to be established, and when Hungary has economic growth then  this will lay the foundations for increased living standards.  It does not work the other way round. We are aware of how  various people live in this country and, with this in mind, I  say that it is impossible for some sharing to be launched  because this would result in upsetting the balance or in having  to levy extra taxes. This can be an important difference  because, although the economic program of the Hungarian  Socialist Party [MSZP] prepared by Laszlo Bekesi contains  similar elements, it is a big question whether the party's core  will stand by it and the trade unions led by Sandor Nagy will  support this or something else. The citizens' attention has to  be directed to the fact that the SZDSZ is only able to implement  its ideas if it gets adequate authority to do this.    [UJ MAGYARORSZAG] Does this mean that there is a negotiating  basis as far as economic programs are concerned?    [Kuncze] This is possible, meaning the program of Bekesi.  To what extent it is possible to agree on the principles  represented by the SZDSZ on this issue is a always a big  question.    [UJ MAGYARORSZAG] Do you agree with the left-wing intention  that the preferential share purchase program [KRP] and  privatization should be stopped?    [Kuncze] Applying the KRP in too broad a circle means  considerable costs to the country. Therefore, this cannot be  further extended. We agree with ensuring an adequate range of  assets in exchange for compensation notes. As a matter of fact,  the KRP does not mean additional resources for the enterprises  and it does not even mean real owners, and this is why we do not  wish to continue it. As for privatization, our view is that  stopping it is out of the question. It has to be carried out  with more determination and faster then now to hand over the  assets to private ownership as soon as possible. It is  necessary to change the institutional system, to apply more  privatization techniques, and to ensure social control.    [UJ MAGYARORSZAG] What role do you intend for the State  Property Management Corporation [AVRT] and the State Property  Agency [AVU]?    [Kuncze] We did not agree with establishing the AVRT and we  would also have placed the AVU under parliamentary control. We  still have the same intentions. We believe that the two  institutions should be amalgamated. It will also have to be  considered whether we need such a large amount of state assets  as at the moment is prescribed by law. Almost all aspects of  the privatization laws will have to be amended.    [UJ MAGYARORSZAG] Is there a contradiction here? Would  parliamentary control slow down the processes?    [Kuncze] We are always questioned about this because people  interpret this as meaning that parliament would make the  privatization decisions. This is not so. One level of  parliamentary control is that parliament will appoint the  participants of privatization, the assets that are to remain in  state ownership, and the general asset policy guidelines. The  second level is that a deputy from each of the parliamentary  parties should be delegated into the supervisory committee of  the asset management organization that is to be set up. We are  not saying that parliament will constantly be examining every  single case. As all parties will participate in the  supervision, social control will be ensured because the  parliamentary parties as a whole represent a significant part of  society.    [UJ MAGYARORSZAG] In your view, is the country's economic  situation indeed more tragic than four years ago?    [Kuncze] Successes and failures have both characterized the  past four years. I do not think it is correct to say that the  country only had successes but I also consider it unacceptable  that only failures existed. Accordingly, the country's economic  situation is diverse. Some positive and very many negative  phenomena exist. I see the breakdown of the internal and  external balance and future dangers from this as most  problematic. The government that came to power four years ago  had countless opportunities to act -- compared with this, the  room for maneuver is significantly smaller now. This is why the  next government will be in an incomparably more difficult  situation.    [UJ MAGYARORSZAG] As for the first round of the elections,  there did not seem to be too much cheering by the SZDSZ.  Nevertheless, you are still in contention, in second place....    [Kuncze] The Free Democrats have had a successful result.  More people voted for us on the lists than four years ago, and  our candidates are still in contention in 162 places. The  reason we were not cheering in our headquarters in Merleg Street  is that we had more or less expected these results, and, at the  same time, we know that the second round can considerably  influence the final results. In my view, the MSZP received too  much support from the voters, and I would not find it fortunate  if the Socialists acquired too much power.    [UJ MAGYARORSZAG] Under what conditions and with what  proportions can a possible MSZP-SZDSZ coalition become a  realistic idea?    [Kuncze] The ability to coordinate programs is the most  important point of view. If the MSZP acquires an absolute  majority on its own, this will mean that the SZDSZ does not have  the necessary weight and, in this case, it would be rather  difficult for us to enter into a coalition. In this case, I  would not even support doing so. If the Socialists do not have  the majority, then the Free Democrats will be under certain  constraints because, if we did not enter the coalition, new  elections would have to be called. As for issues of personnel, I  regard these as of secondary importance. I do not want to talk  about myself. However, it is a fact that [MSZP Chairman] Gyula  Horn is unacceptable to the SZDSZ as prime minister. As for  proportions, getting 25 percent of the parliamentary seats would  already mean a serious influence for the Free Democrats.</p>

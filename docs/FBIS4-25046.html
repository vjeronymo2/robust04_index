			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Kuan Chieh (7070 2212): "CPC Vows to Come down to Hong </F> Kong to Make Arrests"]    [Text] At a national work conference of public  security, state security, armed police, and judicial department  chiefs (bureaus) convened in Beijing in the first half of April,  the CPC made known for the first time that public security and  armed police officers have the power to track down and arrest  key members and ringleaders of hostile organizations outside the  borders who are involved in and mastermind violence and sabotage  and who agitate to overthrow the socialist system and the  central people's government on the mainland.    The headline sounds scary.    But it is genuinely true.  <H5>  "Resolutely Strike at Hostile Elements Colluding with </H5> Hostile Organizations Overseas"    The CPC convened from 7 to 9 April a national work  conference of the heads of public security, state security,  armed police, judicial departments (bureaus). High on its  agenda was a resolute ban on outlawed hostile organizations and  a stern crackdown on subversive activities and sabotage by  hostile forces. Ren Jianxin, Luo Gan, Xiao Yang, Ba Zhongxin,  Tao Siju, and others attended and addressed the conference. Ren  Jianxin spoke on behalf of the CPC Central Committee Secretariat  and State Council: Banning and striking at organized activities  to agitate and subvert the state and people's government and  destroy social order by outlawed organizations and hostile  forces are the main tasks in safeguarding state security,  defending the constitution, and protecting social order. This  is especially true for crack downs on domestic hostile forces  and elements either colluding with overseas hostile political  forces or those overseas who are working against China and the  CPC or are in the employ of overseas hostile political forces  and organizations, and this remains a key job for public  security, the armed police, and judicial departments.    Ren Jianxin said: As soon as something goes wrong in society  or there is a slight change in the climate of the outside world,  domestic hostile forces and elements will emerge and pursue  agitation, sabotage, and subversion with overseas hostile  forces. This is regardless of what people might think about  these matters, and these forces and elements will desist because  of our warnings. Agitation, sabotage, and subversion are the  missions of these hostile forces. Overthrowing the socialist  system and the people's government and creating chaos in tandem  with the hegemonic powers' China strategies are the objectives  of these hostile forces, both outside the border and overseas.  <H5>  "Public Security Has the Power To Track Down and Arrest Key </H5> Members of Hostile Organizations Outside the Border"    Regarding "counterrevolution," the conference chose to  stress  and pay more attention to its substance rather than its name.  The conference came to a consensus on jail term reductions,  parole, and medical parole for good behavior for criminals on  counterrevolutionary charges. The conference made known, for  the first time, that under specifically defined circumstances,  public security and armed police officers have the power to  track down and arrest key members and ringleaders of hostile  organizations outside the borders whose involvement in  masterminding violence, sabotage, and agitation in the mainland  to overthrow the socialist system and the central people's  government has been proven.  <H5>  The Wolf Is Really Coming </H5>   "Outside the borders" in CPC parlance refers to Hong Kong  and  Macao. If we read between the lines of the above statements and  check them against the report on "a hundred Hong Kong people  blacklisted" in the December 1993 edition of our journal and the  "Success 240" military exercise reported in the article on the  "Guangzhou Military Region's mock takeover of Hong Kong" in the  February 1994 edition, which reveals that CPC public security  officers have been stationed in Hong Kong since as early as  1992, and link them with the early secret visits to Hong Kong by  a massive number of CPC officials, they will get a good idea of  how well prepared the CPC is for the move. Lu Ping's statements  on his recent visit about Hong Kong being an economic city and  not a political city also foreshadows such a move!    Even before the death knell of 1997, the good-natured Hong  Kong people will witness the horrific drama of CPC people coming  down to Hong Kong to make arrests with force.    There was once a person who cried that the "wolf was  coming,"  which turned out to be a false alarm. But this time, the wolf  is really coming.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Blantyre, June 6 (AFP) -- Malawi's Alliance for  Democracy [AFORD] says it has abandoned talks with the ruling  United Democratic Front [UDF] and is now formulating a working  alliance with the Malawi Congress Party of ex-president Kamuzu  Banda.    Alliance (AFORD) second vice-president Rev. Peter Kaleso on  Monday told AFP in an interview that talks with MCP were  advanced and "we are waiting to write a letter of understanding."    Kaleso said the talks were initiated by the Congress Party  (MCP) after AFORD twice failed to reach an accord with the Front  (UDF) on forming a coalition government after last month's first  democratic elections.    AFORD, led by outspoken trade unionist Chakufwa Chihana, had  demanded some key ministerial portfolios.    "We think we can make a good opposition with MCP and we will  give UDF a tough time in parliament because they will always be  outvoted," Kaleso said, adding that his party's aim was to see  that democracy thrived.    "We don't want to end with one big party and destroy the  rest. We would end up being a one-party state," he said.    Aford won 36 seats, the MCP 55 and the UDF 84. The UDF is  five seats short of a working majority in parliament.    Chihana -- who has called MCP a party of death and darkness  -- was quoted recently as saying it was better to convert the  devil to work with them.    MCP's publicity secretary Hetherwick Ntaba confirmed in a  newspaper interview that talks with AFORD were under way.    "Yes we are having talks with AFORD... We should be  finalising the discussions in the course of next week," he told  the DAILY TIMES published on Monday.</p>

			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / Libyan MPs in Lockerbie offer LIBYA'S General People's Congress (parliament) said yesterdaythat two Libyans wanted for the 1988 bombing of the Pan-Am airliner over Lockerbie, Scotland, could be tried in a 'just and fair' court, in a decision that could open the door for the two to be tried in the west, Reuter reports. Britain reacted with scepticism. The Foreign Office said Libya had in the past made several offers, but Britain wanted action not words. 'The bottom line is what the Libyans do, not what they say,' an official said. Britain and the US, backed by the United Nations, have demanded that the two men be handed over for trial in Scotland or the US.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Editorial Report] Tokyo FNN Television Network in  Japanese at 2236 GMT, in its "News 2001" program, carries a  25-minute interview with Masanori Goto, deputy secretary-general  of the Social Democratic Party of Japan (SDPJ), by moderator  Yuji Kuroiwa, Keio University professor Yoshiaki Kobayashi, and  political commentator Kenichi Takemura at the FNN studio in  Tokyo.    At 2238 GMT, after citing FNN poll results that show a  majority of SDPJ members want to return to the coalition,  Kuroiwa asks for Goto's opinion on the results.    Goto says: "In the current political situation, a political  party cannot justify its existence if it does not participate in  the administration. In this sense, it is natural that the SDPJ  should want to participate in the coalition."    But he adds: "This does not mean, though, the SDPJ will  return to the second coalition government in its present form."    Kobayashi says the SDPJ may need very persuasive reasons to  justify its decision to return to the coalition. Goto replies  that the SDPJ will make efforts to get the party's policy  reflected in the coalition administration.    Kuroiwa then cites criticism of the party leadership for its  inconsistent political stance. Goto refutes the criticism,  saying the SDPJ is only trying to be responsible.    Goto is then asked why the SDPJ participated in the former  Hosokawa administration when it experienced difficulties and was  forced to make many painful compromises. He says the party  played a significant role on various issues, including rice and  tax reform.    Asked about the SDPJ's position on returning to the  coalition, Goto says: "It would be meaningless to call for the  dissolution of the House of Representatives to hold a general  election under the current multiseat electoral district system."    He says the SDPJ will return to the coalition if the Hata  cabinet resigns en masse to establish a new coalition government.    He says: "It is necessary for the SDPJ to conclude a new  policy agreement with the new coalition. If such an agreement  is reached, it would be possible for the SDPJ to join."    And if agreement is reached, he says, Prime Minister Tsutomu  Hata need not step down because the SDPJ would not rule out the  possibility of him heading the new cabinet.    Takemura joins the discussion, voicing support for the  SDPJ's  stand on returning to the coalition.    Kuroiwa asks about the conditions on which the SDPJ would  return to the coalition, and Kobayashi cites the results of an  FNN poll conducted among SDPJ Diet members. Results of the poll  show SDPJ members want the alliance between Shinseito (Japan  Renewal Party) Secretary-General Ichiro Ozawa and Komeito  Secretary-General Yuichi Ichikawa dissolved; the "Kaishin" floor  group disbanded; transparency in the policy-making process; and  a cabinet resignation or reshuffle.    Goto notes the need to ensure transparency in policy-making,  saying: "There has been criticism of the closed nature of the  meeting of ruling party representatives. Open discussions  should be held not only by party chairmen and secretaries  general, but also by several executives from each party."    Goto is asked why the SDPJ is trying to return to the  coalition.    He says: "It is necessary for us to join the administration  to uphold and implement our policy proposals in a concrete form."    Kobayashi expresses concern that the SDPJ may not be able to  maintain its policies in the coalition. Goto tries to dispel  the concern, saying the SDPJ will make efforts to coordinate  differences in opinion among the ruling parties.</p>

			<p><P> April 30, 1989, Sunday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> A three-member federal appeals court panel has upheld the dismissal of suits by  Pacific islanders claiming damages from U.S. nuclear tests. "Congress has  stripped the courts of jurisdiction over these claims," declared the appeals  court opinion. U.S. District Judge Thomas F. Hogan had ruled in 1987 that  federal courts have no jurisdiction to assess the validity of an agreement  giving the government of the Marshall Islands authority to press claims of  citizens for damages from the atomic tests between 1946 and 1958. The Marshall  Islands and the United States in 1986 signed a Compact of Free Association  giving the islands self-government status. Under the independence settlement,  the United States gave the Marshall Islands government $150 million to pay  people claiming damages from the U.S. nuclear tests in the 1940s and 1950s.  </P></p>

			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / International Company News: Japanese banks sell Y2,654bn in bad loans Japanese banks unloaded bad loans worth Y2,654bn (Dollars 26bn) to the Co-operative Credit Purchasing Company (CCPC), the bad loan purchasing organisation, during the six months to March. This is 2.2 times more than the previous half-year, reflecting a rush by banks to remove non-operating loans from their books. As a result, the CCPC bought non-operating loans with the face value totalling Y4,520bn in the year to March. The debt purchasing vehicle is made up of a consortium of banks, and buys bad loans backed by real estate collateral at a discount. A bank wishing to sell its loan to the CCPC needs to supply it with a loan to fund the purchase. After buying the bad debt, the purchasing company tries to recover the loan through sales of real estate collateral. However, such efforts have so far been hampered by the slump in the Japanese property market. Of the loans, the CCPC has managed to recover only Y30bn. The purchasing company posted a pre-tax loss of Y11m for its first fiscal year to last December due to its inability to absorb establishment costs of more than Y50m. While net operating profits totalled Y44m, net operating losses were Y13m.</p>

			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets: Dow remains resilient in face of weak dollar - The currency shock waves Every week, stock market strategists at US securities houses and banks send out reports to clients and journalists outlining their views on the current state of the financial markets and the economy, and the outlook for both. Every possible factor that might have an impact on stock prices, bond prices, and the economic environment is picked up, studied and commented upon. You name it, they analyse it. Yet, in the past few weeks, the one factor that has grabbed most of the headlines, and dominated much of the talk among investors, politicians and policy-makers - the rapid decline in the value of the dollar - gets relatively short shrift in the majority of reports. The dollar does receive a mention every now and then, but you would think from reading the material that Wall Street's top equity strategists do not care greatly what happens to the greenback. In a way, you would be right. Unlike the UK, where the pound is not only a key influence on the shape and direction of the economy but also a symbol of national virility, in the US the national currency plays a significantly less important role in economic life. However, it has been clear in the last few months that the dollar's decline has been disturbing the financial markets, especially bonds. Since the end of March, when the dollar was holding relatively steady at around Y106 and DM1.68, it has fallen 7.6 per cent against the yen (to a new post-1945 low) and 9 per cent against the D-Mark. Over the same period, the yield on the 30-year bond has jumped from 6.95 per cent to 7.67 per cent. Obviously, other factors such as monetary policy and economic statistics influenced bond prices but the numbers provide a broad indication of how the dollar can affect the government market. The direct impact of a falling dollar is almost always greater on bond than stock prices because investors in bonds fear that the drop in the dollar will feed through into higher inflation and eventually force the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates to curb inflation and support the US currency; and that the falling dollar will make US financial assets (that is, bonds) less attractive to foreign investors. Stocks do suffer because the price of bonds ultimately determines the interest rates at which US companies and consumers borrow money, but they suffer less than bonds because other factors, most notably corporate profitability, play a bigger role in determining the value of stocks. Thus, it is no surprise to discover that since late March, when the dollar began to decline sharply, the Dow has fallen only 3 per cent. One very good reason for the Dow's resilient performance in the face of dollar weakness is that a lower US currency is not necessarily bad news for stocks. When it comes to share prices, there are always good and bad points about a dollar decline. First, the good points. A weak dollar makes US products cheaper abroad, boosting exports and corporate earnings. It also attracts more visitors to the US, who spend their money on US products and services. Higher exports and more tourism dollars in turn help to reduce the massive US trade deficit. A lower dollar is also good for the earnings of US companies with big overseas sales in Japan and Germany, because when they repatriate those revenues they get more dollars for every yen and D-Mark spent on their products. As for the bad points. A weak dollar makes foreign products more expensive in the US: this adds to inflation directly, and indirectly, because the rising cost of foreign-made goods gives competing US producers the cover to raise their own prices. Also, a falling dollar is bad news because it deters foreign investors from wanting to own US-dollar denominated stocks and bonds, something which has contributed to the recent drop in share prices and the rise in long-term interest rates as measured by bond yields. Finally, a weaker dollar is often an indication that foreign investors do not like or trust US economic policy, which should always be a worry for the stock market. This is the point that Mr John Lipsky, chief economist at Salomon Brothers in New York, believes is the key to understanding the impact of a devalued dollar on stocks. He says: 'The most important implication of the dollar's weakness for the stock market is the implied lack of international investor confidence in US policies, the US economy and US financial markets. Hence, the juxtaposition of a weakening dollar, weakening bond market and weakening stock market have together formed the basis for concern.' Mr Lipsky, however, believes that fears about the impact of the falling dollar on US inflation have been overplayed, because the dollar has not declined greatly on a trade-weighted basis. In other words, in spite of all the headlines about a 'dollar crisis', the US currency has fallen sharply only against the yen and D-mark, while actually strengthening against the Canadian dollar and Mexican peso. And in the list of US trade partners, Canada and Mexico rank first and third, respectively, so talk of imported inflation is mostly just that - talk.</p>

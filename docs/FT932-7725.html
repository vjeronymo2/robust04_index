			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses fail to match Eurotrack response CONTINENTAL shares quoted in London offered a positive response as Wall Street held its overnight gains, the Eurotrack 100 ending nearly a percentage point ahead in the post bourse. Where they were open on Ascension day, as in Milan and Madrid, senior bourses seemed more subdued, writes Our Markets Staff. MILAN remained at a 21-month high, the Comit index adding 0.68 to 559.17 in strong turnover, on continued expectations of lower interest rates. Mr Fabio Ferrando of Albertini in Milan believed that, given the continuing strength of the lira, a half point cut in the discount rate was likely to follow swiftly on the heels of agreement on a supplementary budget, expected today. Over the medium term, he thought that further reductions might be expected when agreements are reached on labour reform and on the shape of the 1994 budget, which is due at the end of July. Olivetti continued ahead, after the launch of its rights issue on Monday. The shares rose L64 or 4.5 per cent per cent to fix at L1,474, before L1,470 after hours. Mondadori, the publisher slumped L1,150 or 8.5 per cent to fix at L12,000 before rebounding to L12,500 after-hours amid profit-taking after the recent speculation about a restructuring. MADRID closed virtually flat, the general index closing 0.22 higher at 255.41, block trades keeping turnover relatively respectable at Pta18.2bn, though well down from Wednesday's Pta28.6bn. Tabacalera stood out in share price terms, rising Pta145 or 4.1 per cent to Pta3,695 in volume of 335,436 shares, almost half of which was attributed to block trades by brokers Asesores Bursatiles. WARSAW shot up again. Of 17 stocks listed on the main market, 14 hit new highs and the WIG index rose 254.1 or 9.2 per cent to 3,002.9, its sixth record high in two weeks. Turnover was 345.8bn zloty. Brokers said that the market was simply too small to soak up the sheer pressure of buying at the moment. Meanwhile, the state-owned EL AL Israel Airlines said in New York that it expects to be privatised soon and has seen interest from financial investors in Israel and around the world. ISTANBUL saw further profit-taking which left the 75-share index 105.07 or 1.3 per cent lower at 7,919.59 and 5.15 per cent down from last Thursday's record high of 8,349.31. Mrs Nur Pekin of Schroders in London noted that liquidity was being withdrawn from the market as advance income tax payments totalling TL3 trillion fell due this week and next. Activity was also slowing ahead of a week-long national holiday which begins on May 31 and amid rumours that the Public Participation Administration, which is responsible for Turkey's privatisation programme, was selling some of its holdings. TEL AVIV managed a token recovery in thin trading after several days of losses, the Mishtanim blue chip index closing 0.53 higher at 206.98 in turnover of Shk182m. DUBLIN recovered its momentum, led higher by financial issues, with the central bank's cut in its short-term facility by 25 basis points to 8.25 per cent widely expected. The ISEQ overall index rose 4.4 to 1,528.85.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- May 20                                             THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes*            Open      10.30      11.00      12.00  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100     1154.86    1154.50    1153.93    1155.00 FT-SE Eurotrack 200     1216.91    1218.20    1218.51    1218.80  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes*           13.00      14.00      15.00      Close  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100     1155.35    1155.21    1156.00    1156.03 FT-SE Eurotrack 200     1219.71    1219.07    1219.32    1220.19  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        May 19    May 18    May 17    May 14    May 13  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1147.97   1152.98   1146.07   1148.21   1155.16 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1212.27   1217.75   1214.06   1212.97   1219.59  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  High/day: 100 - 1156.27; 200 - 1221.21 Low/day: 100 - 1153.93  200 - 1216.65  *Partial.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

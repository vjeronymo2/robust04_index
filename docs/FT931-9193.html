			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / Watanabe taken ill after talks in US Mr Michio Watanabe, Japanese foreign minister and deputy prime minister, pictured above in parliament yesterday, was rushed to hospital just hours after returning from talks in Washington with officials of the Clinton administration, Charles Leadbeater writes from Tokyo. His illness, which will keep him in hospital for about two weeks, casts a heavy shadow over his ambitions to succeed Mr Kiichi Miyazawa as prime minister later this year. In recent weeks Mr Watanabe and Mr Miyazawa have clashed on a range of foreign policy issues, such as whether Japan should expand its role in United Nations peacekeeping operations. The visit of the US was widely seen as part of Mr Watanabe's campaign to improve his public profile. Mr Watanabe spent a month and a half in hospital last year after an operation to remove gallstone.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Anatoliy Lopata, chief of the Ukraine </F> General Staff, by Vladimir Katin, RIA's own correspondent at  NATO, specially for NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA in the "Exclusive"  column: "Anatoliy Lopata: `I Have No Doubts That Russia Will  Also Join the Partnership for Peace Program'" -- in Brussels;  date not given]    [Text] Last week in Evers, a suburb of the Belgian  capital, a session of the NATO Military Committee was held,  attended by military leaders of some CIS countries. RIA's  correspondent met and had a talk with Anatoliy Lopata, chief of  the Ukraine Armed Forces General Staff.    [Katin] Mr. General, as far as I know, this is the third  time that you have participated in such sessions. Ukraine is  not an outside observer in this military organization; it  already has one foot in NATO: I mean the joining of the  Partnership for Peace program. As a result, Russia has found  itself in a situation in which, via Ukraine, NATO directly  pushes against its lengthy Western ground and also sea borders.  Presumably Kiev's policy is more oriented toward the West than  toward its traditional ally? The impression is that Russia's  interests are being ignored.    [Lopata] I do not like the statement that Ukraine has one  foot in NATO. Ukraine simply supports the Partnership for Peace  program. Actually this means support of peace and stability in  Europe. Tell me, is this bad? I consider this a universal  task. Now you say that through Ukraine's participation in the  Partnership program, NATO is approaching Russia's borders. I  personally have no doubt that Russia will also join the  Partnership. Yet, this does not at all mean that NATO has  opened all the doors for us. The meaning of the Partnership is,  by joint, coalition-based actions, to facilitate the  preservation of peace in Europe, prevent an outbreak of war, put  an end to internecine fighting, and stop bloodshed wherever it  occurs. Russia cannot exclude itself from participation in  addressing these tasks and therefore it cannot but accept the  Partnership program. I have no doubts on this count. After  all, Russia is already doing very much to stabilize the  situation in various regions of the world.    [Katin] At what stage of cooperation with NATO is Ukraine at  present and what is being done in practical terms?    [Lopata] We have signed what is basically a framework  agreement with NATO. Now the possibility is being considered of  allocating forces and funds as our contribution toward  implementing some joint tasks with NATO. I do not think that at  the moment these will be large or complex tasks. After all,  such participation also has an economic aspect -- expenses. But  even now we can prepare and send our military units for  participation in joint actions with NATO. This, however, cannot  be more than one battalion with reinforcements.    [Katin] If I understand you correctly, this year Ukraine is  ready to enter the phase, as you say, of implementing practical  tasks in interaction with NATO units; is that right?    [Lopata] Absolutely. This can begin in the current year.  You know that two of our battalions are now operating in former  Yugoslavia. We put them at the UN Security Council's disposal.  To be sure, Partnership is quite another program, but so far we  have the right to send a mere 1,220 military personnel:  soldiers, officers, and observers. Such is the will of our  parliament. This is the size of the contingent allowed to be  kept outside the country. It seems that a new parliament, which  will start working in the very near future, will adopt more  definitive legislation on this score.    [Katin] Let us return to the "Partnership for Peace"  program. You think that Russia will finally accept this  program, join it. But you must be aware that in Russia this  approach has been formulated as follows: We may join it, but  not on the terms on which, say, Albania or Estonia did it. What  is your view on such an approach?    [Lopata] This is a very wrong approach. If we are to be  partners -- I underline in boldface -- partners, then relations  within the program should also be partner-like, that is, honest  and equal with regard to rights and obligations. We have not  yet talked about how many troops or how much money one member or  another should provide. What we are talking about is that  everyone may participate with as many resources as he has at his  disposal in fulfilling joint missions to keep peace and  stability in one region or another... But to demand that a  special status be given means to place oneself above your  partners. In this case there will be no partnership. I repeat:  partnership is equality of all members.    [Katin] How do your assess the current state of  Russian-Ukrainian military relations?    [Lopata] Our relations with Russia are currently undergoing  a difficult period. The reason for this instability is  uncertainty regarding the Black Sea Fleet problem. The Black  Sea Fleet is a stumbling block that precludes us from reaching  understanding. What is the reason here? The problem is not how  to split the fleet. Precisely this problem can be resolved  fairly easily. Everyone understands that -- both the Russian  side and the Ukrainian side. The main problem is the Black Sea  Fleet infrastructure, its basing on Ukrainian territory. It is  here that we encounter many complex nuances that should be  resolved both at the political level and at the level of defense  ministers. We should make it clear where Ukraine's fleet will  be based and where Russia's will be. If a corresponding  political decision is made, we should determine what, how, and  on what terms should be given to Russia from this  infrastructure, say, with regard to bases... By raising the  question like this we, in turn, create the need to resolve the  problem of mutual payments. I hope you understand me. This is  why these should be very well balanced, respectful relations.  One should not forget that relations between Ukraine and  Russia, relations between our two peoples, largely shape the  overall situation in Europe. This is why I would like our  problem to be resolved in the worthiest and gentlest manner  possible. I am completely certain that we will be able to  untangle these knots. Without fail! This is just a matter of  time and... personalities who are dealing directly with the  entire range of matters. The role of personalities has its own  significance. I would like experienced specialists to deal with  that, so that people will look somewhat farther than the present  day, so that they will see the prospects for the evolution of  our peoples. We should be attuned only to benevolent prospects,  for they are for the whole life. The way current problems are  being settled will determine our future, the future of our  children and grandchildren, their relations. This is why we  should act competently and respectfully with regard to each  other.</p>

			<p><P> October 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: SAN MARINO;  </P> <P> SON'S WORK SCUTTLES PERMIT  </P> <P> A 16-year-old's home business has scuttled his mother's bid to enlarge her  house -- at least temporarily.  </P> <P> The Planning Commission on Wednesday refused to hear Gayle Young's request for  an expansion permit because Young's son, Joseph, 16, runs a mail-order business  from the home without a license.  </P> <P> City Manager John Nowak said the city will try to resolve the matter  informally. Meanwhile, Young's request for expansion will be heard next month.  </P> <P> Joseph Young, who calls his business "Prime Opportunities," sends out  literature on ways to earn money. His mother said she didn't know a license was  required for his endeavor.  </P></p>

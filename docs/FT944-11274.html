			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / The Markets: Prodding the commodity bubble - Global Investor For most of this year, commodities have looked like a one-way bet. Aluminium and copper, the two most heavily-traded metals, have jumped by 70 per cent in the past 12 months, and cocoa, coffee and orange juice, like many soft commodities, have also shown sharp gains. For all those investors who get vertigo at the size of the rises there have been others to argue that, judging by commodities' behaviour in previous economic recoveries, further large gains are still on the cards. On the back of this enthusiasm, investment and broking houses have rushed in the past few months to put together commodities indices, as well as specialised funds to make access to the markets easier. That marks a sea change from the 1980s, when most investment houses took a distinctly haughty stance towards non-income yielding investments, and towards the commodity markets in particular. Familiarity with a wider range of zero-coupon instruments and zero-dividend shares has bred tolerance. However, as commodities prices have continued to rise in the past few weeks, some who were previously bullish have begun asking whether speculative activity is now driving the prices above levels justifiable on analysis of demand and supply alone. It is the right point at which to ask that question; although evidence of specu-lative participation is at the moment anecdotal, it does suggest that such trades are an increasingly important element. The bullish case is still vigorously espoused, nonetheless. Goldman Sachs, the broker, and one of the loudest advocates of commodities' attractions, has been urging large private pension funds to keep 5 per cent of their global portfolios in commodities, a high level by traditional standards. Goldman bases its argument on a projection of steadily rising worldwide demand as European and Japanese economies gather steam. It has on its side indications such as the shortages of aluminium already reported by industrialised countries. It could also point out that demand for copper and nickel rose by 7 per cent in the first half of 1994 compared with the corresponding period in 1993. The more specialised the material's use, the more dramatic the effect of such increases in demand; the price of palladium has doubled in the past year simply because of booming world-wide demand for mobile telephones and personal computers. The current proponents of commodities also argue that not much capacity has been added in recent years in commodity-producing industries. They argue instead that the fall in eastern European production has contracted supply. It is unclear yet how many houses are following the bulls' advice. However, analysts are starting to say, with more conviction than a few months ago, that the price of commodities, both metals and soft, has risen higher than can be explained by levels of demand and supply. For a start, market traders and analysts estimate that banks and investment funds have put Dollars 16bn into metals so far this year. They also reckon that banks control some 75 per cent of the London Metal Exchange stocks. There are also signs that investors are losing their discrimination between commodities. The zinc price, for instance, has followed that of the other metals upwards despite European overcapacity. One weakness of the bulls' argument is that it does not recognise the rapidity with which patterns of supply and demand can change in response to the price rises. Although it is true that supplies of metals have not increased greatly in the past few years, they could now do so, enticed by higher prices, locked in by manufacturers through the futures markets. Meanwhile, traders acknowledge that the price rises could cause a permanent drop in demand, if substitutes are found for raw materials, or if investment to raise efficiency is stepped up. But the central weakness is that investors' use of commodities as an escape route from bond and equity markets troubled by inflationary fears is misguided. From one perspective, this is a sound bet, as commodity price rises may eventually feed through into retail prices. If this does happen, and inflationary pressures do emerge again, commodities could fare well initially. But if interest rates rose in response, investors would be likely to desert commodities in favour of interest-bearing investments. On the other hand if manufacturers fail to pass on the increases in raw material costs to consumers, commodity producers will eventually find themselves restrained in their ability to charge more. In recent sets of UK data, the sharpest price increases in manufacturing output were reported in sectors with greatest exposure to world commodity prices, such as pulp and paper, metals, rubbers and chemicals. However there are also signs that manufacturers have had to absorb much of the increases in raw material prices without passing them on, and that margins are being squeezed. In the past year, investors' enthusiasm for commodities has looked like a rare example of perfect timing. But increasingly, one of the main props for commodities prices is simply inflationary fears, fuelled partly by the rising cost of commodities themselves. That is a fragile argument on which to be resting even a small slice of a portfolio. There are enough powerful advocates of commodities' attractions at the moment, and demand for raw materials is growing fast enough to give investors an opportunity to begin to unwind positions which they have built up this year. It is a chance they should consider taking.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Total return in local currency to 3/11/94  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                             % change over period                  US   Japan   Germany    France    Italy      UK  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Cash Week           0.09    0.04      0.09      0.10     0.16    0.09 Month          0.42    0.19      0.41      0.45     0.69    0.46 Year           3.69    2.19      5.88      8.31     8.31    5.44  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Bonds 3-5 year Week          -0.25    0.32      0.10      0.07    -0.08    0.56 Month         -0.33   -0.02      0.80      0.31     1.09    1.41 Year          -2.59   -0.71      0.64     -0.68     1.41   -0.03  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Bonds 7-10 year Week          -0.35    0.53     -0.03     -0.09    -0.89    0.49 Month         -0.86    0.01      0.97     -0.33     0.44    1.67 Year          -7.14   -1.92     -4.50     -7.47    -5.65   -4.05  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Equities Week            0.6     0.0       1.8       2.7      2.8     2.4 Month           1.7    -0.6       1.6       2.6     -5.0     4.2 Year            4.3    -2.9      -2.8      -7.5     10.9     2.2  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Cash &amp; Bonds - Lehman Brothers.

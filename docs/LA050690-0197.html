			<p><P> May 6, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ABOUT REAL ESTATE: LEASE-OPTION MAY HELP SELL HOUSE  </P> <P> QUESTION: We are trying to sell our house and are having difficulties finding  qualified or interested buyers. Recently, we received a contract that meets our  price but contains language to the effect that the purchasers will lease our  house for a period of up to two years with an option to purchase at the end of  that period. Can you discuss this kind of transaction?  </P> <P> ANSWER: With home sales lagging in today's marketplace, we are seeing a revival  of the so-called "creative financing" techniques that were so popular in the  early 1980s, when real estate sales were also slow.  </P> <P> Sellers are willing to experiment with any legal avenue to give them an  opportunity to sell their house.  </P> <P> One such creative method is a lease with an option to purchase. This is a  legitimate real estate transaction. Basically, under the arrangement you have  discussed, your purchasers will move into your property, will be tenants for a  period of time, and some time within the next two years may buy your house.  </P> <P> First, you must recognize that if your purchasers buy, you may be selling your  house as late as two years from now, but at today's prices. Although I am not a  fortune teller, and am troubled about the future of mortgage-interest rates, I  remain confident that the price of real estate in the metropolitan area will  continue to increase.  </P> <P> Thus, even before considering some of the legal protections needed in an option  to purchase, you should consider the economic potential of this transaction.  You might want to provide an escalation clause, so that the price will go up  periodically depending on when the sale takes place.  </P> <P> A second consideration goes to the status of your existing mortgage. I suspect  that your purchaser is attempting to gamble that rates will go down within the  next two years, and your purchaser will have an opportunity to select the best  time to go into escrow. However, you should analyze your own mortgage document  (the deed of trust on your present house).  </P> <P> The standard form instrument specifically states that if such a lease contains  an option to purchase, the lender reserves the right to call the entire  mortgage due and payable. This may trigger the so-called "due on sale" clause,  which has been the subject of much litigation and comment throughout the  country.  </P> <P> Before signing the contract with your prospective purchaser, discuss this  matter with your present lender to assure yourself that the lender will not  accelerate the payments and create difficulties for you during the lease option  period.  </P> <P> Finally, you should explore the taxable consequences of such a transaction. If  you are selling the house in which you live (for tax purposes called the  principal residence) the Internal Revenue Service will permit you to defer the  profit you will make on the sale of your house if within 24 months of the sale,  you purchase another principal residence equal to or greater than the selling  price of your present home.  </P> <P> If you plan to purchase another house within the next 24 months, and if your  purchaser does not exercise the option to purchase until after that time, you  may be hit with a substantial tax on the profit on the sale of your house. You  must carefully review this situation with your tax adviser before you sign the  lease-option contract.  </P> <P> If, after giving consideration to these matters, you still want to go through  with the lease-option arrangement, here are some suggestions to protect your  interest:  </P> <P>  -- The purchaser should be required to give a substantial deposit now. If the  purchaser decides to walk away from the deal within the next two years, the  deposit should be forfeited in your favor.  </P> <P>  -- Draw up a document that will look like a standard landlord-tenant lease.  Work out the details of the transaction now, before your purchasers move into  the property. For example, who will pay the utilities and the real estate  taxes? If your tenants pay the taxes, what guarantee do you have that the  payments are made -- and made timely?  </P> <P>  -- The contract must also reflect that at the actual settlement, the  purchasers will take the property in an "as is" condition.  </P> <P> In other words, you do not want to guarantee the plumbing, structure or any  other condition of the house when the settlement takes place -- which can be as  late as two years from now. After all, your purchasers will be occupying the  property, and you do not want to guarantee against their own living style.  </P> <P> What happens if your purchasers decide not to go through with the transaction?  This is a very delicate area for discussion, but must be spelled out, in  writing, before you allow your purchasers to move in. After all, an option to  purchase is not a guarantee that the purchasers will in fact buy. It is not a  binding purchase and sale contract.  </P> <P> The appropriate landlord-tenant laws of your jurisdiction should be explored,  and appropriate safeguards spelled out in the basic arrangements.  </P> <P> Kass is a Washington lawyer and newspaper columnist specializing in real estate  and tax matters.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Replacement of Fuel Rods of 5 Megawatt Nuclear Power </F> Station Begins" -- KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, May 14 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the  Foreign Ministry of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea  said the replacement of fuel rods has begun at the 5 megawatt  experimental nuclear power station according to its operation  plan.    Answering to a question put by KCNA, he said this refueling  is part of the undertakings to normalize our peaceful nuclear  activities and it could not be delayed any longer in view of its  technical safety.    The Secretariat of the agency persistently avoided sending a  group of inspectors on unreasonable pretexts and did not take  necessary measures for the replacement of fuel rods. Under such  conditions, we had no other choice but to remove seals and start  taking out fuel rods for safety reasons, he said, and went on:    Though we decided to strictly contain the fuel rods and put  them under the control of the agency, some quarters of the  United States are now spreading the rumor that we are changing  the fuel rods to extract plutonium enough for the manufacture of  four or five nuclear bombs. This is quite contradictory to the  fact and cannot be construed otherwise than a sinister intention  to intensify pressure on the DPRK under the pretext of refueling.    Actually, refueling is taking place under the watch of the  cameras installed by the agency. So, there is no ground to  worry about the diversion of the replaced fuel rods for another  purpose.    Now some quarters are contending that if we stopped and put  off refueling, the problem of observation might be solved. This  is, however, an unrealistic speculation that does not take into  account the characteristics of the technical safety of our  experimental atomic power plant.    If refueling is stopped midway, it may cause a new danger in  the view of safety.    But we think that since refueling has just begun, there  still  remain possibilities to resolve the problem.    We proposed to the agency negotiations for an agreement on  practical matters related to the presence at the replacement of  fuel rods along with complicated outstanding issues with it.    The solution to the issue depends on the attitude of the  agency.    If the agency persist in its unreasonable demand, ignoring  our unavoidable conditions regarding the replacement of the fuel  rods, the issue would become more complicated.    We will as ever make every possible effort for a fair and  fundamental solution to the nuclear issue.</p>

			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Waters find buyers The utilities sectors accounted for most of the FT-SE 100's best performing stocks yesterday as institutions focused on the sectors' above-average yields and dividend potential. Water shares, which have been left for dead by buoyant rec and generator areas recently, were the best performers, ahead of results this week from two of the sector's FT-SE 100 constituents, Severn Trent, due this morning, and Thames, scheduled for tomorrow. Both companies are expected to post annual dividend increases of around 8 per cent. Severn Trent was the best individual performer in waters, closing 6 ahead at 526p. Thames edged forward a penny to 481p. The recs' preliminary results season commences tomorrow with London Electricity (up 7 at 590p), which is forecast to increase its dividend total by more than 15 per cent. Norweb, due to report on June 27, forged ahead 12 to 649p and Northern, which is reporting on June 29, put on the same amount at 692p.</p>

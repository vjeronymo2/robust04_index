			<p>In     an apparent effort to strengthen the hand of reformers as they  at tempt to implement the new market reforms adopted at the recent  party plenum, the PRC-owned Hong Kong daily Wen Wei Po has  portrayed retired party elder Yang Shangkun as supportive of  paramount leader Deng Xiaoping during Yang's early January "visit  and inspection" to Shenzhen.  Drawing attention to the symbolic  nature of Yang's trip, the paper pointed out that it was his  first visit to Shenzhen since 1992, when he "accompanied Deng" on  the southern inspection tour that inspired the current wave of  rapid economic growth and ambitious reform (9, 11 January).  Judging by the 11 January edition of Wen Wei Po, Yang used the  trip to air his strongest endorsement of Deng's reform agenda  since retiring last spring.  The paper quoted Yang as saying  during a tour of a local industrial zone that the "tremendous"  changes evident there "proved in every way" that the reform  policies "advocated by Deng Xiaoping"-- the "chief architect" of  China's reform and opening up--were "entirely correct."  By  contrast, neither the PRC-owned Hong Kong media nor the official  PRC media reported that Yang had mentioned Deng Xiaoping during  an 18-day visit to Yang's native province of Sichuan in October,  noting only, for example, that Yang had merely applauded the  change he saw in Sichuan and had expressed his hope that the  province would "leap forward" in reform (Xinhua, 12 October  1993).  Since October, PRC media have reported three appearances  in Beijing by Yang (Xinhua, 2 November, 22 and 26 December 1993)  but have not reported any remarks by the retired party elder.     In what may have been an attempt to amplify the political  significance of Yang's supportive remarks on Deng, the recent Wen  Wei Po reporting portrayed Yang as physically healthy.  The 9  January report, for example, described the 87-year-old Yang as  "healthy and strong" and able to "walk steadily" and "talk  cheerfully and humorously."  Similarly, the 11 January article  said that Yang had "walked around" in a Shenzhen park for "more  than half an hour."   Since January 1993, when Xinhua reported  that Yang was "hospitalized" (21 January) for an apparent  illness, official PRC media, aside from periodic references to  the "vigorous strides" taken by Yang while walking in public,  have not been known to have commented as explicitly on his  health.  PRC media are not known to have reported on Yang's visit  to Shenzhen.  (AUTHOR:  VOSS.  QUESTIONS AND/OR COMMENTS, PLEASE CALL CHIEF,  CHINA ANALYSIS TEAM, (703) 733-6097.)  EAG/BIETZ</p>

			<p><P> March 16, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> UC IRVINE NOTEBOOK / BARBIE LUDOVISE;  </P> <P> MAKING ENDS MEET HASN'T BEEN SMOOTH SAILING FOR CREW TEAM  </P> <P> How does a collegiate crew team keep itself afloat? Financially speaking, it  can be a doozy. Just ask UC Irvine Coach Larry Moore.  </P> <P> "Contrary to popular belief, we don't do bake sales," Moore said. "Though we've  tried just about everything else."  </P> <P> This season, and recent seasons past, the Anteaters have raised funds by . . .  </P> <P>  -- Taking inventory at local department stores.  </P> <P>  -- Ticket-taking and ushering at Irvine's Crawford Hall.  </P> <P>  -- Decorating and cleaning up after a school sock hop.  </P> <P>  -- Staging all-night frozen yogurt sales.  </P> <P>  -- Passing out 30,000 flyers announcing the opening of the Bren Events Center  . . .  </P> <P> And, of course, selling candy bars and raffle tickets, as well as customized  lithographs of themselves created and signed by local artist Ruth Hynds.  </P> <P> Two weeks ago, the Anteaters made $750 filming a television commercial with  Arnold Schwarzenegger for a Japanese noodle company. The athletes could do the  commercial because the sport is not under National Collegiate Athletic Assn.  rules, according to Moore.  </P> <P> In the commercial, Arnold eats the noodles, then, rowing alone in a tiny dingy,  proceeds to blow away the entire eight-man Irvine crew.  </P> <P> Who says fund raising isn't glamorous?  </P> <P> Only three months ago, Irvine athletic administrators, searching for a way to  trim $70,000 from its budget, seriously considered dropping crew -- a  non-scholarship but partially funded sport.  </P> <P> But with the support of past coaches, alumni and former Irvine Chancellor Dan  Aldrich -- a longtime crew supporter -- the program has been given a reprieve.  </P> <P> According to Rob Halvaks, senior associate athletic director, crew will receive  a total budget -- to include coaches' salaries, travel, equipment, uniforms,  etc. -- of $40,000 this year, a $30,000 decrease from last year's total budget  of $70,000.  </P> <P> Last year, crew spent $111,000, which included its share of the Irvine budget  and money raised during the season.  </P> <P> According to Moore, the average fully equipped, eight-man boat costs about  $18,000 ($26,000 for a premium imported model). Oars are $250 apiece. Annual  travel expenses are a minimum of $12,000.  </P> <P> And the Irvine crew base dock, built 25 years ago, is in serious need of  renovation. Cost: $40,000.  </P> <P> Although crew supporters weren't thrilled with the 30% budget decrease, it was  a much better option than their only other option -- having no crew at all.  </P> <P> Former Irvine coach Duvall Hecht, who started the university's crew program in  1965, is not unhappy with the university's decision to trim the crew budget. In  fact, Hecht said the time has come for the Anteater crew alumni to come  together and support the program.  </P> <P> "It's time for the alumni to do more and to be more organized and active," said  Hecht, who, along with Aldrich and former Irvine oarsmen Bruce Ibbetson and  Paul Ryan, is beginning to organize a full-fledged alumni fund-raising  campaign.  </P> <P> "It's not right to think someone should do everything else for you. We've been  given 20 years of support from the university. It's not like they're stopping  completely. UCI is not turning us out of the nest, they're just saying we need  to help out a little more. I think it's terrific. I think we're a mature  program now, and we have some alumni who can help."  </P> <P> Ibbetson, a two-time U.S. Olympian in rowing, is the co-chairman of the  fund-raising committee, called the Irvine Rowing Assn.  </P> <P> "All the people that have been involved (with Irvine crew) understand the value  of the program and the success it brings not only to the individual, but to the  university as well," Ibbetson said. "No one wants to see that just die and go  away."  </P> <P> Especially the current Irvine crew.  </P> <P> Moore says he has yet to make his final decision of which varsity oarsmen will  fill the top boat for Irvine's season opener, the San Diego Crew Classic, March  31-April 1 at Mission Bay.  </P> <P> The varsity boat is named Myrmecophaga Jubata Irvinus, Latin for "Giant  Anteater of Irvine."  </P> <P> "About 12 different guys are being considered right now," Moore said. "And it's  a tossup between two coxswains. This is the time where I find that all of a  sudden things begin to happen."  </P> <P> Irvine has some 60 athletes out for crew this year. Of the potential varsity  members, only three are seniors. "Realistically, we hope to make the finals of  the (Pacific Coast Rowing Championships) this year," Moore said. "And getting  fifth or sixth there would be great . . . But next year looks a lot better."  </P> <P> Irvine's sailing team, the defending national champion, is the top-ranked team  in the nation, according to Sailing World magazine.  </P> <P> Last weekend, Irvine won the Trux-Ulmstead Regatta, the largest collegiate  regatta of the season, at the U.S. Naval Academy at Annapolis. "This win was  really important for us," Irvine Coach Craig Wilson said. "A lot of the other  top teams really sort of thought we wouldn't be a threat when we came east.  Last year, we won the national championship in the West (at San Francisco). So  a lot of the Eastern teams thought we wouldn't be able to handle their  conditions. They sort of wrote us off."  </P> <P> After Irvine, Old Dominion is ranked second, Navy is third and Charleston is  fourth.  </P> <P> Irvine hammer thrower Mike Morales became the first Anteater to qualify for the  National Collegiate Athletic Assn. outdoor track and field championships  Saturday.  </P> <P> The NCAA meet will be May 30-June 3 at Provo, Utah.  </P> <P> Morales, a junior, broke his school record by three feet with a throw of  203-feet 1-inch to win the event at a triangular meet at Santa Barbara. Morales  also won the shotput and discus events at Santa Barbara.  </P> <P> Freshmen Lana Banks (400 meters), Andrea Sansom (800 meters) and Sabrina Miles  (shot put) each recorded victories to lead Irvine's women's team to a 91-43  victory over UC Santa Barbara Saturday.  </P> <P> Of the 30-member women's squad, only two-time All-American distance runner Beth  McGrann is a senior.  </P> <P> Irvine notes  </P> <P> Seniors Kevin Floyd and Mike Doktorczyk were named most valuable players of  Irvine's basketball team Monday. Floyd scored 995 points in his career, ranking  No. 11th on the school's all-time list. Doktorczyk, who was named to the Big  West Conference's second team, led Irvine in scoring (15.9 points) and  rebounding (7.8) this season. Sophomore forward Jeff Herdman, of Mission Viejo  High School, was named Irvine's shooter of the year. Herdman made 42 of 82  three-point attempts (51%) and led the nation in three-point shooting in  mid-February. Other award winners were Ricky Butler (newcomer of the year), Rod  Palmer (hustle award) and Don May (most inspirational).  </P></p>

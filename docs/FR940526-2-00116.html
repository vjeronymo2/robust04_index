			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=4 --> 6.3&blank;Miscellaneous Expense Data Collection Procedures <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Medical care items were surveyed consistent with the approach used in the Goods &amp; Services component. For quality-control purposes, Runzheimer used its in-house research staff to conduct much of this survey. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The following medical-care items were priced in each allowance area and in the Washington, D.C., area: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Nonprescription pain reliever. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Prescription drugs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Vision check. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Dental service. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Doctor visit. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Hospital room. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Health insurance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Runzheimer computed a Medical Care subcategory price index for each item in each allowance area by comparing each local average price with the Washington, D.C., area average prices. These indexes were combined using weights derived from the CES to compute a Medical Care subcategory index for each allowance area. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=4 --> 6.4&blank;Miscellaneous Expense Survey Results <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Appendix 12 contains the results of Runzheimer's data collection and index calculations. As the appendix shows, the relative costs of the majority of the items in the Miscellaneous Component are based on surveyed prices. Therefore, the Miscellaneous Component index reflects living-cost differences among areas. The cost of only two items_life insurance/pensions and contributions_does not differ among areas. Although these two items together have a significant weight, one should keep in mind that the Miscellaneous Component has the smallest weight of the four components. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 2.2 describes how the Miscellaneous Expense component indexes are combined with the other component indexes to derive the final index for each area. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

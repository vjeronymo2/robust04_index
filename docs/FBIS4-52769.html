			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Today's Comment" column by Thlang Ambal: "By Being </F> Indecisive, The War Will Not End"]    [Text] The domestic policy of the Kingdom of Cambodia  remains complicated. It is neither liberal nor non-communist.    We have made this complaint because the king -- the revered  shade of the people -- still hesitates to dissociate with the  Khmer Rouge [KR] communists. Therefore, our internal policy  seems to be in the middle point between liberalism and a killing  field. This is similar to being on the abyss of death.    The formula that the king has proposed, such as allowing the  KHmer Rouge to share power in the government, is not one to  bring about peace. Neither is the formula for dividing Cambodia  into three parts. The one on for reelection to seek the winners  in order to establish peace is a formula that will only lead to  a more serious war.    The failure of the war against the Khmer Rouge, which  control  only 10 percent of the territory, was caused by His Majesty's  indecisive policy.    The only formula for achieving peace is to be decisive  toward  the communists, to stand firm on the side of the enemies of  communism who are always ready to help us. If we stand firm on  just one side, we will not regret even death.    If we agree to let the Americans help us sincerely, like  good  friends, Thailand, which also depends on the Americans, will  certainly not dare help the Khmer Rouge. This will be a chance  for the Khmer Royal Armed Forces to totally crush the Khmer  Rouge.    It is better to take just one side than both. In this  matter, former Marshal Lon Nol was very brave. He resolutely  sided with the Americans. It is better to take just one side  than wavering, which only causes endless misery to the people.    Observers of internal politics say that if we reject the  Khmer Rouge, stop recognizing them, and turn to the free world  countries for help in strengthening our army, the war will  certainly end very quickly.    By being indecisive, one cannot be a leader and the war will  not end.</p>

			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / On patrol in the heart of republicanism: Jimmy Burns joins British troops on their daily duties on the streets of west Belfast Peace seemed far removed from the minds of the soldiers of 42 Marine Commando yesterday as they made their way nervously through the back streets of republican west Belfast. Around midday, a company of about 40 men split into teams, some on foot patrol, some in armoured Land Rovers, and zigzagged through the Springhill estate, not far from the home of Sinn Fein president Mr Gerry Adams. The Catholic west of the city is an area of high unemployment and entrenched political allegiances. The area resonates with symbols. A republican flag flies over a building site; a mural proclaims: 'You can kill a revolutionary, but you can't kill a revolution' over portraits of Che Guevara and James Connolly, one of the republican leaders executed by the British after the 1916 Easter Rising in Dublin. Along the street of flags and murals, the marines struck attitudes of disciplined aggression, covering the area in as short a time as possible in the sights of their automatic rifles. Very briefly, there was time for tourism. A soldier photographed a colleague in front of a memorial in memory of 26 dead local IRA volunteers and other civilians who had died at the hands of the security forces and loyalist paramilitaries. The memorial, dedicated to 'Irish freedom,' had been unveiled by Mr Adams. The streets were otherwise deserted except for a young man and his child standing at the open door of his small terraced house. 'This is normal for us. Not a day goes by when the Brits don't come round. I wish they'd just leave us alone,' the man said. One of the marines took an imaginary pot shot through his rifle sight and confessed to being bored. 'It's been too quiet and we've got the rest of the day left,' he said. Another tried to make conversation with an old woman but a barking dog intervened and he beat a tactical retreat, uttering a loud expletive. The marines have only recently begun their latest Northern Ireland tour, joining more than 10,000 other troops in the province. Security sources said yesterday the threat from the IRA and loyalist paramilitaries remained high in the absence of a political settlement in the province. They believe much hinges on the outcome of the Dublin-London peace initiative. It is widely accepted that the IRA will only declare an extended ceasefire if the Dublin talks lead to the making of political concessions to the nationalist community.</p>

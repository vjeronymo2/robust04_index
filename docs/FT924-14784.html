			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / Concern for wage councils increases CAMPAIGNERS for the reten-tion of the wages councils yesterday stepped up their efforts on the eve of the Tory conference speech by Mrs Gillian Shephard, the employment secretary, David Goodhart writes. Mrs Shephard is not expected to announce the abolition of the councils - which set minimum pay rates for nearly 10 per cent of the workforce - in today's speech, but campaigners against abolition are convinced, as a result of recent correspondence with her, that she will include abolition in this autumn's employment bill. Ms Mo Mowlam, shadow minister for women, published a report arguing that wages councils had been an important force for pay equality. Mrs Shephard has written to the Equal Opportunities Commission pointing out there was a clear body of research demonstrating 'the relationship between higher pay and fewer jobs'.</p>

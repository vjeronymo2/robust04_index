			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / Inheritance tax record 'a scandal' Inheritance tax imposes a higher real burden today than when it was introduced by Labour 20 years ago, says the Country Landowners Association. In a Budget brief to Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, the association said it was a scandal that a government committed to low taxation and cascading wealth through generations should have increased the burden of inheritance tax on middle-range estates. The association, whose members include owners of large farms and country estates, said that the 40 per cent rate was one of the highest in the world.</p>

			<p><P> September 12, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VAN DE KAMP'S FILES FOR BANKRUPTCY UNDER CHAPTER 11  </P> <P> After 75 years of serving up goodies to generations of Southern Californians,  Van de Kamp's Holland Dutch Bakers has filed for bankruptcy law protection.  </P> <P> The privately held company continues to operate out of its landmark Dutch-style  bakery uilding in Glassell Park, northeast of downtown Los Angeles, but has  laid off more than 100 employees and owes back pay to many that remain, union  representatives said Tuesday. Company officials are asking the unions to make  concessions to keep the firm going.  </P> <P> The bankruptcy filing was brought about by several factors, including slow  summer sales, high labor costs and some extraordinary losses last year because  the change to a new computer system disrupted deliveries, said David A. Gill,  bankruptcy lawyer for Van de Kamp's.  </P> <P> Calls to Van de Kamp's President Robert Schott and its owner, Simon S. David,  were not returned Tuesday. David also owns a Carson-based real estate firm  called Interstate Consolidated Industries.  </P> <P> The baking company's unions had another explanation for Van de Kamp's problems.  </P> <P> "It's been run into the ground by the present management," said Bill Walton,  president of Bakery, Confectionary &amp; Tobacco Workers Union Local 37, which  represents most of the unionized employees. "It's a sad story because Van de  Kamp's is a good company and a good name."  </P> <P> Kenneth Young, an attorney for the Teamsters union, which represents another 60  employees at the company, said, "There's no doubt that, if the current  management stays in, the company will be out of business maybe in a matter of  weeks."  </P> <P> Gill said management has projected that it has enough money to continue  operating the company. Despite the unions' harsh words, "Our principal secured  creditors and the unions are being most cooperative in keeping the company  alive," he said.  </P> <P> In a Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition filed Aug. 31, Van de Kamp's listed assets  of $15.03 million and liabilities of $42.7 million. Under Chapter 11, a company  continues to do business but is protected from its creditors while it works out  a plan to pay its debts.  </P> <P> The company's largest creditors are Security Pacific National Bank, which is  owed about $5.5 million, and the Internal Revenue Service, which is owed about  $2.5 million.  </P> <P> Van de Kamp's laid off about 125 of its nearly 500 employees late last month,  just before the bankruptcy petition was filed, Walton said. About 140 employees  are owed two weeks pay, he said.  </P> <P> Gill said Van de Kamp's is meeting its current payroll, and U.S. Bankruptcy  Court Judge Robin L. Riblet has given the company authority to pay some of what  it owes employees. When a company is operating under Chapter 11, the court must  approve all major expenditures.  </P> <P> The company is seeking temporary relief from its collective bargaining  agreements, including suspending contributions to the employees' medical and  dental plans and eliminating vacation pay and sick leave pay, Young said.  </P> <P> Riblet has given the company and the unions until Friday to negotiate some sort  of settlement. Riblet has indicated that she will grant a 30-day suspension of  the contracts if no other agreement is reached, he said.  </P> <P> "Obviously, the employees are very discouraged and very angry," said Young, the  Teamsters' attorney. "The company is 75 years old, and they have employees that  have been there 25 or 30 years, who grew up with the company."  </P> <P> Van de Kamp's Holland Dutch Bakers, with its trademark blue windmills, was  founded in 1915 by brothers-in-law Theodore J. Van de Kamp and Lawrence L.  Frank, uncles of California Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp. The Van de Kamp  family sold its interest in the company more than 20 years ago.  </P> <P> In recent years, Van de Kamp products have been sold mostly in supermarkets.  </P> <P> A separate company under different ownership produces Van de Kamp's frozen  foods.  </P></p>

			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / The Conservatives in Bournemouth: Farm tenancies to be revived The government is to legislate to revive the market in farm tenancies and provide more opportunities for the start of new farming enterprises. Mr William Waldegrave, agriculture minister, said a bill would be launched early in the parliamentary session which opens next month freeing new tenancies from the succession obligations imposed by the last Labour government. Mr Waldegrave described the 1976 legislation, which gave new rights to the children of tenants, as arguably the most damaging measure this century to young farmers and new entrants to farming. Mr Waldegrave said the new legislation would permit farmers and landowners to 'make agreements to suit each other'. The government had acted in response to representations by the National Farmers' Union, the Country Landowners' Association, the Tenant Farmers' Association and young farmers. He said 'both sides' agreed that the new legislation would result in more tenant farms becoming available, attract 'new blood' and offer a chance of reversing the decline in the tenanted family farm. Responding to attacks by a succession of constituency representatives on the scale of fraud and corruption in the Common Agricultural Policy, he promised that Britain would make reform 'central' to future developments in the European Union.</p>

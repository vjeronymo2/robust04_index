			<p>940418 FT  18 APR 94 / People: Boonstra's light switch Philips, the Dutch electronics group, has tapped yet another high-flyer in marketing to strengthen its board and bolster its return to profitability. The company, traditionally strong in inventing products but not always as successful at selling them, will appoint Cornelis Boonstra, former president and chief operating officer of Sara Lee, the US-based food and personal products group, to the head of its lighting operations in the summer. Boonstra, a 56-year-old Dutchman, will also join the management board and look after activities in the Asia-Pacific Region. Boonstra, whose abrupt departure from Sara Lee in January came as a complete surprise, is scheduled to replace Einar Kloster, who is stepping down from lighting in July to return to his native Norway. Significantly, however, Boonstra will be given a place on the board, expanding its membership to six directors. Kloster, a scion of Norway's Kloster shipping family who spent more than 30 years with Philips, never belonged to the management board, though he did sit on the wider group management committee. The appointment of Boonstra, whose 'heavy-weight' status as a top US corporate executive puts him in the running as a potential heir to Jan Timmer, Philips' president, is part of the group's search for marketing expertise. The move also extends the trend at Philips towards giving top jobs to outsiders with extensive international experience. Earlier, Pierre Everaert, a Belgian-born naturalised American, was coaxed away from the chairmanship of Ahold, the Dutch food retailer with several supermarket chains in the US. Philips also recently announced that Floris Maljers, chairman of the Dutch arm of Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch soap-to-margarine manufacturer, will become chairman of the group's supervisory board, a position usually filled by retired Philips executives.</p>

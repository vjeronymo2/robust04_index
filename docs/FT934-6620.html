			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / Big groups seek power price curbs Large companies yesterday demanded tighter electricity price controls after an academic study suggested that Britain's power consumers were being overcharged by Pounds 545m a year. The Energy Intensive Users Group said the report by Brunel University showed the Pounds 1bn-plus annual distribution profits of the regional electricity companies in England and Wales were twice the level that could be justified in a risk-free monopoly business. The group is asking Offer, the electricity regulator, to rein back the 'profits bonanza' in its forthcoming review of distribution price controls. Brunel's report concluded that rates of return of 6.6 per cent on new assets and 4.4 per cent on existing assets were appropriate for the power distribution businesses. The Chemical Industries Association, which commissioned the report, said the actual rate of return in 1992-3 was 9.2 per cent, resulting in profits of Pounds 1.04bn, against the Pounds 497m which could be expected from a 4.4 per cent return. Mr Doug Rodger, the association's executive director for business, said that if the 4.4 per cent return rate were applied, electricity prices would fall about 3 per cent. Brunel's report recommends significant changes to use-of-system charges, including more consistency and openness in the regional distributors' charging mechanisms. It says use-of-system charges should be more cost-reflective. As currently constituted, the charges penalise customers who use the distribution networks more efficiently. Mr Ian Blakey, chairman of the Energy Intensive Users Group, said the post electricity privatisation price rises for large users contrasted with developments in continental Europe where prices had remained static. Mr Rodger said reductions of 25 per cent to 30 per cent were needed for large users to bring prices into line with the continent.</p>

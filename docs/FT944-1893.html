			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / Down with the lottery]: Britain's new game of fantasy finance will do far more harm than good The national lottery is fantasy finance. It ranks with fantasy football, another television game, and fantasy fornication, enjoyed by viewers of Bumwatch and similar programmes. It is a leisure industry created to exploit our sole remaining unprivatisable asset, our national imagination. It is a tax on the poor derided by the rich, a machine for the creation of a spurious sense of self-satisfaction for the pathetic boobies who toss their coins into its maw. There is nothing of worth in this crap game, no net gain for charities, no work of art saved or building erected that could not have been financed by less preposterous means, no true promise of glory for the millennium, no benefit to anyone save perhaps the shareholders of Camelotta Suckers, plc. You will have gathered that I do not wholeheartedly admire the gamble so many millions of our brothers and sisters have been seduced into taking. Right first time. You will not catch me buying a ticket. Anyone who goes for a 14m-to-1 shot is simple; that so many do is a nuisance. I queued to pay for a Christmas present in WH Smith last week and found after 10 minutes that it was the 'lottery only' line. The same double-take frustrated me when I tracked down one of Britain's dwindling collection of main post offices to have my seasonal gift weighed. Two large chains of newsagents, WHS and John Menzies, have been reported as expressing concern about the disrupting effect of long lottery queues in their stores. The rake-off is only 5 per cent, which must be compared with what ought to be higher margins on sales of tangible goods such as magazines, stationery, and confectionery. Maybe retailers will profit one day. We shall see. They must count against business lost the gain in customers drawn into their shops by the urge to waste money. There can be no calculations until after Christmas. Charities will certainly lose. Donations will fall by Pounds 172m a year, according to a survey carried out for the National Council for Voluntary Organisations. The lottery masters predict a handover of Pounds 136m from their proceeds. That leaves good causes Pounds 36m short. Wait, the merchants of fools' gold will say. These are only estimates. Maybe the numbers will turn out more favourably. Only Camelotta Suckers can believe that. Anyone else who does is not thinking. Maybe? Maybe the rail privatisation will go smoothly. Maybe the board of British Gas has demonstrated a fine grasp of fair salary structures. Maybe Mr Tony Blair will become a socialist. We know what will happen to charities. The evidence is there. A state lottery was introduced in Ireland in 1987. Last year Irish charities were asked about its effect. Some 87 per cent said they had lost out. The rest of the scheme is a swindle. Charities constitute one of five groups that will share the 28 per cent of punters' payments set aside as conscience money. The other four - the arts, sports, the national heritage and the 'millennium' fund - have been promised that the treasury will not claw back their lottery income by reducing allocations from the national exchequer. Talk about suckers] This is a government promise, like April 1992's 'no new taxes'. Let us be generous. Say the treasury allows the lottery pot a few years' free run. What then? Stephen Dorrell has asked for ideas from readers of The Sun. 'Do you play football or hockey . . . ?' asks the heritage secretary. 'How would you fancy new, fully-equipped changing rooms?' Perhaps wheelchair access to local historic buildings or refurbishment of the local art gallery? Mr Dorrell has no shame. 'It is not too far-fetched to believe,' he writes, 'that new indoor tennis courts paid for by the National Lottery could provide the next British Wimbledon champion.' In the immortal words of hucksters everywhere, he appends the warning, 'some applications will be lucky, others will not'. Our Mr Dorrell is one of the better ministers in John Major's cabinet. He is not a natural born con-man. It is a pity he has been given so demeaning a task. Perhaps he is carried away by the supposed glamour of the idea, as was the BBC when it allotted prime time to the draw, thus producing one of the most humiliating programmes it has ever transmitted. Happily, it has come a cropper, ratings are down, and the time for second thoughts has arrived. Others apparently having second thoughts this week were the 'XXX's', the reportedly Moslem family whose main breadwinner scooped just about Pounds 18m. This led to a comedy of pretence, as the lottery promoters sought to show that they would stick to their undertaking not to disclose the name of winners who preferred anonymity. They went to the high court for an injunction. The tabloid papers do not like that. They printed and lavishly illustrated everything they could dig up about the newly-rich individual, save his name, then had the injunction removed. It is delightful when thieves fall out. On this occasion those who conspire to steal our common sense, Camelot and the tabloids, staged a convincing quarrel from which, no doubt, both profited in the form of greater dollops of the notoriety they so avidly seek. The question of the week became: should winners have the right of privacy? The answer: no, not really, but Camelot must be seen to be rigorous in its efforts to maintain any contractual obligation it may have to protect winners from discovery. As to our 'lucky' northern family, we cannot yet be certain that it will bless the day its numbers came up. Games of chance, according to the Koran, are abominations devised by Satan. 'They ask you about drinking and gambling,' says the holy book. 'Say: 'There is great harm in both, although they have some benefit for men; but their harm is far greater than their benefit'.' Drinkers may demur, but, as to the lottery, the Islamic view is sheer common sense.</p>

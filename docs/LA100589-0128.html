			<p><P> October 5, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> A bill approved by the Senate Finance Committee would give more than 100 years  of amnesty to fraternal groups, taverns and convenience stores for past-due  levies under a little-known tax on liquor retailers. Protests over the tax had  mounted after a Pennsylvania Elks lodge got a $9,000 bill for 50 years of  non-payment. The measure would prohibit the federal government from collecting  unpaid balances and penalties on the 123-year-old tax if they accrued before  Jan. 1, 1985, according to Sen. John Heinz (R-Pa.). Although the tax has been  on the books since 1866, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms says that  up to 40% of retailers had never heard of it until the agency began a vigorous  collection effort last year.  </P></p>

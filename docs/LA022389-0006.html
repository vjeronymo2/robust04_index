			<p><P> February 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FPPC JOINS LAWMAKER IN URGING 8-BILL ETHICS PACKAGE  </P> <P> The state's often criticized political watchdog agency, the Fair Political  Practices Commission, joined forces Wednesday with a crusading freshman  legislator to propose a comprehensive package of ethics legislation.  </P> <P> The eight-bill ethics package, the most sweeping to be introduced in the  aftermath of the FBI's investigation of Capitol corruption, would, among other  things, ban the pervasive practice of legislators accepting expensive gifts and  honorariums from special interests.  </P> <P> FPPC Chairman John Larson told reporters that he believes the Legislature is  finally "in the position to act" on political reform. He contended that  lawmakers are not inherently unethical but are bedeviled by a system in which  there is "a lot of temptation" to do wrong.  </P> <P> "It's hard for people to turn down things that are offered," Larson said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Financial Disclosure  </P> <P> In addition to banning gifts and speech-making fees, the FPPC-backed bills  would beef up financial disclosure requirements and lock the political  "revolving door" that allows legislators and Administration officials to move  between government and lobbying jobs. Top Administration officials and  legislators could not lobby the Legislature for one year after leaving their  offices.  </P> <P> The legislation also would close a loophole in the Political Reform Act of 1974  that prevents prosecution of elected state officeholders involved in conflicts  of interest.  </P> <P> Two other bills included in the package but not yet endorsed by the FPPC would  ban fund raising in non-election years and prohibit members of the State Board  of Equalization from voting on tax cases involving campaign contributors.  </P> <P> Much of the FPPC's legislative agenda is being carried by Democratic  Assemblyman Ted Lempert, 27, of San Mateo, who won his seat last November by  running against the Sacramento "system" -- even as his campaign was being  partly underwritten by Assembly Democrats.  </P> <P> The fact that Larson and the FPPC would leave the fate of its ethics package to  a first-term lawmaker with little clout underscores the difficulties faced by  political reformers in the Capitol and the sensitive nature of the ethics  debate itself.  </P> <P> Assembly Democratic leaders, particularly Speaker Willie Brown, want to give  Lempert, who was the first Democrat in this century to be elected from his  largely Republican district south of San Francisco, a chance to make good on  his campaign promises to help reform the political process.  </P> <P> But the leadership has given Lempert no assurances that any of his bills will  pass. Moreover, Brown and other legislative leaders from both parties have  taken liberal advantage of large speaking fees, free trips and gifts that would  be banned by the legislative package.  </P> <P> According to FPPC figures, the 120 members of the Legislature received nearly  $3.2 million worth of gifts and honorariums in a three-year period ending in  1977. Speaker Brown alone collected more than $161,000 in gifts and speaking  fees during 1987, including expense-paid trips to Austria, Great Britain,  Ireland and Japan.  </P> <P> "I've let (the leadership) know what my proposals are but they haven't given me  a firm commitment one way or the other," Lempert sheepishly told reporters.  "There has been a lot of talk, a lot of people saying this is the time to get  something through. Hopefully we will be able to surprise some people."  </P> <P> The FPPC's decision to adopt a high profile on the ethics issue follows a  period in which it increasingly has been accused of dealing timidly with  legislators. It also represents somewhat of a turnaround for Larson, who took  office in 1986 convinced that the watchdog commission should spend more time  educating politicians and less time investigating their activities.  </P> <P> On Wednesday, Larson said he thinks the system has gotten out of control. "Most  people who make $50,000 or $60,000 a year don't expect others to give them  $1,000 gifts or $1,000 speaking fees," he told reporters. "It appears to the  public that (special interests) are getting something for their money."  </P> <P> A number of lawmakers have introduced their own ethics bills in hopes of  softening the perception of wrongdoing triggered by the FBI's raid last August  on the Capitol offices of four legislators and two aides.  </P> <P> None of these bills will be set for a vote until the Assembly's Committee on  Ethics makes its own recommendations, which is not expected until shortly  before the Legislature adjourns this fall.  </P></p>

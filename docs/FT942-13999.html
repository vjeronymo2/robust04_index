			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / Southern lines in latest round of BR sell-offs British Rail's South London and Sussex Coast routes are among the latest franchises to be put up for sale under the government's privatisation plans. The seven routes announced yesterday are the second round of sell-offs and also include the Anglia route network, Cardiff valleys, Merseyrail, Midland main line, South and West Wales and the West Coast main line. At the same time, a private-sector consortium planning a bid for a loss-making part of BR's freight operations said it had recruited a third member. The Port of Felixstowe has joined P&amp;O Distribution, part of the P&amp;O shipping group, and Russell Davies, a privately owned transport group, in their bid for Freightliner, which handles container traffic. With six passenger routes due to be sold in 1995, the franchises unveiled yesterday would allow the government to reach its target of privatising at least half of the BR network by April 1996. Mr Roger Salmon, franchising director, said it was a 'challenging timetable'. These routes have been chosen because they are self-contained and are not likely to see passenger and revenue projections upset by big construction projects such as the Channel tunnel rail link. One factor influencing the order in which routes are privatised is the speed with which managers prepare their own sets of accounts and demonstrate their ability to adapt to the contractual arrangements. Mr Salmon is still working out the terms under which he would offer franchises and the extent to which management teams would assume a degree of risk. 'I want a clear proposition which I can put to serious buyers,' he said. 'The main issue is how we split the risk.' Yesterday's announcement leaves 12 franchises to be sold, probably during 1997. The bid for Freightliner, which made a loss of Pounds 38m on turnover of Pounds 70m, is expected to involve tough negotiations on the level of track-access charges to be paid, as well on the purchase price. Freightliner is thought to pay between Pounds 20m and Pounds 25m a year in track charges to BR at present. The bidding consortium believes it can make considerable efficiency savings as well as marketing the container service more effectively. But it also expects the government to compromise on the level of track charges. People, Page 14</p>

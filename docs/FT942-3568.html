			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / KPN beats market on first day Koninklijke PTT Nederland, the partially privatised Dutch telecommunications and postal company, staged a moderate rise on its first day of trading in Amsterdam yesterday. The shares, priced at Fl 49.75 last week, opened at Fl 50.50 and quickly rose to a high of Fl 50.70 before falling back to close at Fl 50.20. The premium was more pronounced for private investors, who had been offered a discount of Fl 2.50 per share up to 75 shares as an incentive to take part in the largest share launch in Dutch history. Nearly 60 per cent of the shares on offer were taken up by foreign institutions. Trading was active, with more than 17m shares changing hands, a new record for a day's trading in one stock in Amsterdam. The rise in KPN's shares ran counter to yesterday's lower trend for Dutch equities. The government of the Netherlands sold 138.15m KPN shares - a 30 per cent stake - raising Fl 6.9bn (Pounds 2.5bn). A second tranche of KPN shares is expected to be sold by the end of 1997. The European Options Exchange in Amsterdam also launched options trading in KPN yesterday, the first time in the Netherlands that options and equity trading in a new issue has taken place simultaneously. The share issue was nearly three times subscribed. Applications from private shareholders were honoured in full up to 75 shares, with a sliding scale above this level. Some 188,500 private shareholders took part, of whom 31,000 were KPN employees.</p>

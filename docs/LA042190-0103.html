			<p><P> April 21, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOLF ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> DOUGLASS-COODY INCREASE LEAD TO 6  </P> <P> Dale Douglass and Charles Coody birdied six holes in a row and nine of their  last 11 Friday to expand their lead to six strokes after two rounds of the  Legends of Golf tournament at Austin, Tex.  </P> <P> The runaway leaders combined for a 10-under-par 62 and completed 36 holes in  121, a record 23-under par in the 13-year-old better-ball event. The record was  122, set by Don January and Sam Snead in 1982 at Onion Creek, a par-70 course.  </P> <P> Douglass and Coody broke that mark with two eagles, 20 birdies and a lone bogey  in two trips over the par-72 Barton Creek course, which is being used for the  first time this year.  </P> <P> Eleven of those birdies came Friday, with Coody accounting for six and Douglass  five. Most came on a six-in-a-row string beginning on the eighth.  </P> <P> "We're tickled to death," said Coody, the 1971 Masters champion, who did the  bulk of the work in a first-round 59. "It's another nice score, but we didn't  play particularly well in some spots."  </P> <P> But some spectacular putting helped them increase their advantage. Coody made a  40-footer for par on the 16th hole and Douglass birdied the last two holes with  putts of more than 30 feet.  </P> <P> "The putts are continuing to go in, but we can't count on that continuing for  two more days," Douglass said.  </P> <P> Defending champions Al Geiberger and Harold Henning are in second place.  Geiberger scored an eagle-3 as he and Henning matched the leaders' 62 and  reached the halfway point at 127, 17-under par but six behind.  </P> <P> Jim Gallagher Jr. posted three birdies and a bogey for his second consecutive  round of 70 and a one-stroke lead over a bunched-up field at the midway point  of the Greater Greensboro Open at Greensboro, N.C.  </P> <P> Possibly because of the high rough at Forest Oaks Country Club, most players  failed to make any ground on par, despite favorable weather.  </P> <P> Four golfers were at three-under-par 141, seven were at 142, 10 were at 143 and  another 10 were at 144.  </P> <P> In all, 32 of the 155 players who started the tournament shot par or better, an  unusual experience for a course that generally yields low scores.  </P> <P> The cut was at 147, and that eliminated Curtis Strange, who had a 150, to end a  streak of 17 tournaments in which he had survived the first two days. Payne  Stewart, who won the Heritage tournament last weekend, also was eliminated with  a 148.  </P> <P> For a time, it looked as if Phil Blackmar would begin a charge, climbing to  six-under through 15 holes. But his tee shot at 16 landed in a fairway bunker  and led to a double-bogey six.  </P></p>

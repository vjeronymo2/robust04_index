			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / Survey of Building For Asia's Future (20): Difficult period  -South Korea: Finance despite ambitious plans to increase investment in infrastructure - needs to slow down the overall rise in construction output which it has blamed for the doubling of the country's annual inflation since 1985. Restrictions on the issue of building permits for private residential and commercial development have been introduced in a bid to reduce activity. Controls which had been expected to be lifted in the spring have been extended. Many people believe they will remain in force at least until the end of the year - such is the difficulty of cooling the overheated construction sector. Private development, dominated by housebuilding, has accounted for about 60 per cent of construction output in recent years. The government's aim is to restrict real increases in output, after allowing for inflation, to between 3 per cent and 4 per cent between now and 1996. But current forecasts are that total construction output will rise by 7 per cent in real terms this year. Since 1988, annual construction output has risen by 69 per cent, to account for about a fifth of GNP last year. Construction workers' wages almost quadrupled during the same period while GNP rose by 26 per cent. Mr Lee Kun Kyong, director of overall planning division at the Korean Economic Planning Board, says the increase in Korean inflation to about 10 per cent last year was due in a large part to the rapid rise in construction output and wages which created labour shortages and forced other industries to increase wages. The government has asked companies to restrict pay increases to 5 per cent this year. Investment emphasis will now switch from housebuilding - 2m homes were constructed between 1988 and 1991 - to state- and local authority-led spending on infrastructure. Taxes, however, will have to rise if spending targets are to be met. The special task force established by the president to identify priority projects has recommended increased taxes on petrol and diesel to make up a potential investment shortfall of 10 trillion won by 1996. Korea has some of the cheapest petrol and diesel prices in the world. Raising taxes would be very unpopular and might be difficult to achieve in an election year. Programmes will also depend upon the ability of state-owned corporations to raise domestic and international loans. These would be guaranteed by the government and would be repaid out of income when projects such as the Yong Jong do international airport and the Seoul Pusan high-speed rail link start operating. About half the cost of the railway and about a quarter of the cost of the airport is expected to be met from domestic and international loans. Financing the vast development programme proposed by the South Korean government therefore will be difficult.</p>

			<p><P> February 17, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> WARMER TEMPERATURES FORECAST NEXT WEEK;  </P> <P> CLOUDY BUT DRY WEATHER EXPECTED FOR WEEKEND  </P> <P> High cloudiness and some patchy fog along the coast should be the worst the  weather gets in Orange County through the weekend, forecasters said Thursday.  </P> <P> Although an approaching upper-level trough will deepen the marine layer and  bring slightly cooler weather to Southern California today and Saturday, the  National Weather Service said no rain is expected "at least through the first  of next week."  </P> <P> Meteorologist Pat Cooper of WeatherData, which provides forecasts to The Times,  said there is a "very slight chance of drizzle" today and Saturday, but she did  not expect it to materialize.  </P> <P> "It all depends on how deep that marine layer gets," she said, adding that  after Saturday, when onshore winds will give way to breezes coming from inland,  "it should warm up just a little."  </P> <P> Monday and Tuesday, she added, should be sunny and warmer, in Orange County as  well as the rest of the Los Angeles area.  </P> <P> The National Weather Service said Los Angeles' high temperatures should be in  the low 60s today and in the upper 50s Saturday. Southland readings should  range from 58 to 73 Sunday through Tuesday.  </P> <P> Thursday's Los Angeles Civic Center high was 66 degrees after an overnight low  of 43. The high relative humidity was 80%, and the low was 33%.  </P> <P> The mountains and deserts will have the same high cloudiness, with high  temperatures at the mountain resorts of 44 to 50 today and 36 to 46 Saturday.  Maximum readings in the high deserts should be 58 to 66 today, 52 to 62  Saturday. In the lower deserts, the highs will be 68 to 75 today and 64 to 70  Saturday.  </P> <P> The surf is expected to be 2 feet high along beaches in Santa Barbara, Ventura  and Los Angeles counties and 3 feet along shorelines in Orange and San Diego  Counties.  </P></p>

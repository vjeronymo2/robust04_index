			<p>910507 FT  07 MAY 91 / Arts: Kyung-Wha Chung - Barbican Hall There are not that many chances to catch Kyung-Wha Chung in performance these days and so a solo recital is all the more valuable. For her appearance in the Barbican's Celebrity Recital series on Saturday the violinist had chosen a programme entirely of sonatas by Beethoven, though not the favourite 'Spring' Sonata, which was perhaps fortunate on one of the most wet and chill spring holiday weekends in recent memory. The evening had a quite different atmosphere from the last violin recital I attended at the hall, the one given by Anne-Sophie Mutter last autumn. These are two artists with musical personalities poles apart: Mutter deriving all her strength from a deep inner calm, Chung edgy and intense, a player on a short fuse. You can almost see the physical tension build up, as she crouches over the violin, ready to pounce on the next phrase. The whole recital tingled with an electric intensity. Chung finds it difficult to relax and play even the most lyrical movements without all that nervous energy pushing its way to the surface. The concentration never lapses and she has a way of ending phrases with such a powerful spark of electricity that one senses the charge flowing on unabated through the silence until she plays again, picking up the current where she left off. In Stephen Bishop-Kovacevich she has found a pianist who in many respects makes an ideal partner, ready to match his violinist's fire, but skilfully able to channel her energies into performances that have depth as well as surface energy. Between them they gave involving accounts of two of the Op. 30 Sonatas. The A Major was youthfully alert; the fierce C Minor was driven along with demonic intensity, as though pursued by the Furies. To follow these with Beethoven's thoughtful, nostalgic last Sonata, Op. 96 in G, made a well-balanced programme. Chung worked hard here to tame her demon within, introspectively tapering away the ends of phrases, introducing mellow colours in the slow movement, though it is difficult to imagine any soloist failing to respond to an opening chorale as deeply felt as was Bishop-Kovacevich's. Theirs is a partnership that could profitably be pursued further.</p>

This week he was making a final pitch for support in  Belgium,  the Netherlands, and Greece. On 9 March, when the Committee of  the Regions (COR) holds its first meeting in Brussels and the  189 members vote for their president, Blanc, a French MP, the  president of Languedoc-Roussillon and mayor of the tiny commune  of La Canourgue, will learn whether his personal odyssey has  been successful.    But even before it emerges belatedly from the womb, the new  committee Blanc seeks to lead seems a weakling child. The COR  was designed to give the regions a voice in EU policy-making  under the Maastricht Treaty. But it has been so watered down  since first conceived that critics rate it the equivalent of a  popgun when it comes to firing off shots at Commission President  Jacques Delors and his merry men, not to mention EU governments.    It has so many potential faults that some fear it could  retreat into paralysis. The 189 members have been appointed in  national delegations, ranging from 24 for large EU countries to  six for Luxembourg.    Alongside any chauvinistic differences lies the ideological  divide. The COR is likely to be dominated by the centre Right,  although the socialists will be the largest political grouping.    But the biggest divide is likely to be the almost equal  split  between representatives of local authorities and those of  regions, with their widely different powers and roles. For  instance, the prime minister of North Rhine-Westphalia with its  18 million inhabitants and a gross domestic product larger than  seven EU countries, may be less than content to sit down and  argue the point with local mayors and councillors.    Blanc faces tough competition for the post of president.  Charles Gray, a cheerful Scottish Socialist who was previously  head of the EU's largest local authority, Strathclyde, has  written personally to all members announcing his candidacy.    Luc Van den Brande, the minister-president of Flanders,  which  under Belgium's new Federal Constitution enjoys considerable  legislative powers, including the right to conclude  international treaties, is another challenger. Finally, the  contest became a four-way fight when Pasquall Maragall, the  widely respected Socialist mayor of Barcelona for the past 12  years, entered the fray.    There is even speculation that Jordi Pujol, the Catalan  leader whose support for Felipe Gonzalez is keeping the minority  Socialist Spanish Government in power, may throw his hat in the  ring at the last minute, claiming that he alone has the  political stature to make the early days of the COR a success.  Amid these manoeuvres, Germany, the most federal EU member, is  ignoring this battlefield and targeting instead the post of  secretary-general, which is permanent and likely to be the seat  of power. Presidents change every two years.    To many it is a mystery why such experienced politicians  used  to wielding power at home should wish to become the figurehead  of a body which enjoys neither legislative nor budgetary powers.  Indeed, the COR is a far cry from the powerful body which  Germany initially sought.    Despite support from Belgium, Italy, Spain and the European  Commission, Germany's original concept of establishing an organ  to represent regional interests at the European Union level for  the first time was considerably weakened during the Maastricht  negotiations. To save money and curb its influence, the COR has  been grafted on to the existing EU advisory body, the Economic  and Social Committee (ESC).    That shotgun marriage is resented by both partners. It will  lead to quarrels over staff and money and has sparked fears in  the largely invisible ESC, a forum for industry, business, trade  union and consumer views, that it will be eclipsed by the more  political COR. Both are working for an early divorce, possibly  in 1996 when the Maastricht Treaty is reviewed.    The COR has had a far from auspicious start to life. Last  year EU government leaders decreed that it should meet by 15  January. That date was missed because of local elections in  Portugal and various administrative difficulties and at least  four others were pencilled in before agreement was reached to  meet on 9 and 10 March. Despite the doubts, the Germans,  Belgians and Spanish are treating the COR seriously. Their  delegations are almost entirely composed of senior regional  ministers.    The COR has a purely advisory role. Under Maastricht,  governments must consult it on any legislative initiative in  five areas. But already the European Commission has decided to  canvass its views in other areas of obvious interest to local  and regional authorities, such as voting rights in local  elections and immigration and asylum policy.    Whether governments will listen to these views is another  matter. But all the presidential candidates agree that only by  putting their full political weight behind carefully crafted  opinions will the COR's members be taken seriously. Many,  particularly the Germans, Spanish and Belgians, will use their  own national channels to ensure these views are listened to by  governments.    In many ways, the creation of the COR and EU treaty  recognition of local and regional government is inevitable.  Regionalism is a powerful force in many EU countries. About  half the legislation adopted by the EU is ultimately implemented  by regions and local authorities. If regions are involved in  the decision making, it should, say the COR's supporters, be  easier to ensure those laws are effectively applied.    After the traumas of the Maastricht debate exposed the  credibility gap between Europe's governments and EU institutions  on the one hand and citizens on the other, many now see regions  and local authorities as a means to bridge the divide. The  Committee of the Regions is on probation. It has just two years  before its role is reviewed in which to demonstrate to its  critics and supporters why it should be taken seriously.  <H5>  Structure of the Committee </H5>   The Committee of the Regions first meets in Brussels on 9-10  March. It has 189 members, plus an equal number of alternates,  appointed by European Union governments for four years.    Germany, France, Italy and Britain have 24 members each.  Spain has 21, Belgium, Greece, Netherlands and Portugal have  12, Denmark and Ireland have nine, and Luxembourg has six.    Budget for 1994: ECU12 million ($13.5 million).    Membership ranges from regional ministers and presidents to  local councillors and mayors of small villages and communes.    The president is to be elected by the members at the first  meeting.    The secretary general is to be appointed by senior Committee  members.    The COR was established under the Maastricht Treaty to give  EU regions a voice in policy-making. Its role is purely  advisory.    Governments must consult the COR in five specific areas:  economic and social cohesion, including the ECU13 billion to be  spent on special EU regional projects over the next six years;  trans-European networks; public health; culture; and education  and training. In addition, the European Commission will consult  the Committee on other subjects conceived to be of regional  interest.</p>

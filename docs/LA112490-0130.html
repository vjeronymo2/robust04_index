			<p><P> November 24, 1990, Saturday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Deficits Loom in 30 States: At least 30 states face budget deficits because of  the rising cost of services, falling tax revenues and slackening consume  spending, according to surveys by the National Assn. of State Budget Officers  and the Boston Globe. The deficits range from $42 million in Tennessee to $1  billion in New York.  </P> <P> Consumers are spending less, and the less they spend, the more likely  businesses are to lay off workers. State governments also have trimmed their  payrolls. Job losses, by both public and private employers, are adding to state  spending, as unemployed workers sign up for state benefits and more families  join welfare rolls. Such layoffs have depressed states' third major source of  revenue: personal income taxes.  </P></p>

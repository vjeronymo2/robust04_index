			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / Government Bonds: Treasuries show slight gain as dollar stalls US Treasury bonds were finishing with slight gains yesterday after tracking the dollar's movements in the foreign exchange markets. Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  5/32 at 99 15/32 , with the yield slipping to 7.538 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was up  1/16 at 99 27/32 , to yield 6.192 per cent. For the second day, there was no fresh economic guidance to push prices out of their tight range. Traders again focused their attention on the dollar, which recovered some lost ground against other leading currencies in the early going, only to slip back in the afternoon. The reaction to the greenback's early improvement was favourable, though restrained. By midday, securities across the maturity range showed modest gains in light trading. Activity picked up in the early afternoon, when strong demand surfaced for a Treasury auction of Dollars 17.25bn in new two-year notes. Bonds extended their gains when the issue was awarded with a yield of 6.27 per cent, a little lower than expected. But the rally was quickly aborted, partly due to the dollar's inability to hold its early gains. The market's timidity after the successful two-year sale did not bode well for today's auction of Dollars 11bn in five-year securities. European government bond markets got off to a weak start yesterday as traders remained wary in the absence of any economic data. But they recovered in the afternoon due to a technical 'squeeze' which forced dealers wanting to cover their short positions to chase bond prices higher. The release today of US durable goods orders data for July and news from Germany on inflation in August could provide the markets with a fresh direction, analysts said. However, they said volume was likely to remain thin until the end of the holiday season. 'There is no fundamental reason for investors to get involv-ed,' said Mr Sanjay Joshi, chief economist at Daiwa Europe. The main casualty of the day was the Italian government bond market, which fell heavily at the opening on a newspaper report which appeared to suggest that the government was considering a rise in the withholding tax on government short-term bills and certificates to 15 per cent from 12.5 per cent. On Liffe, September Italian government bond futures lost 1 1/2 points to the day's low of 97.54 in reaction to the interview with Mr Filippo Berselli, under-secretary at the finance ministry. But they recovered to trade around 98.33 in late afternoon, down 0.47 point on the day, after the official said that the government had no plans to raise the tax. Mr Julian Jessop, international economist at Midland Global Markets, said that in spite of yesterday's confusion, a rise in the tax was not out of the question. Indeed, such a move could well be accepted by the market if it was presented as part of a decent package of measures aimed at tackling the budget deficit. In any case most overseas investors did not pay the tax, he said. News that the Bundespost was issuing DM2.5bn worth of 10-year paper did not thrill the bund market but prices ended higher on the day due to technical short-covering. On Liffe, the September bund future stood 0.23 point higher at 91.46 in late trading, off the day's low of 90.96. Some dealers were hopeful that better-than-expected inflation data would provide some relief. A rise in the yearly rate to 3 per cent from 2.9 per cent had already been discounted by the market so a flat result could well produce a recovery, they said. The firmer tone in bunds and a minor rebound in sterling helped UK gilts stage a late rally although the long end did better than the short end of the yield curve. On Liffe, the September long gilt future rose by 1/8 point to 100 7/8 in later trading, off the day's low of 100 5/32.</p>

			<p>940829 FT  29 AUG 94 / World Bond Markets: Tokyo The rise in short-term rates hurt the Japanese government bond last week, and the yield on the No 164 10-year benchmark closed up 11.5 basis points at 4.685 per cent. With institutional investors taking profits ahead of the September book closing, a further rise in yields is likely, while further indications of economic recovery are also expected to hurt the bond market. This week, the July industrial production figures, released Wednesday, are expected show a stronger performance than the original government projection, due to demand spurred by the hot summer weather. However, Salomon Brothers in Tokyo sees the technical factor - book-closing manoeuvres - and the seasonal rise in yields in the summer wearing off in the near term. As investors turn their attention to economic fundamentals, the compound yield on the benchmark will move back towards 4.3 per cent, says the broker. The argument against higher long-term yields in the near future is that inflation remains low and private machinery orders are below the troughs of the previous two economic cycles. Worries over extra bond supply and the rise in US bond yields seem overdone, due to the lack of correlation of such factors with Japanese government bond yields in the past.</p>

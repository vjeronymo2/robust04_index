Medvedev and S.K. Lopukhov under the rubric </F> "Information Sciences"]    [Text] Vsevolod Nikolayevich Medvedev completed the  VIA [Military Engineering Academy] imeni F.E. Dzerzhinskiy, and  is a doctor of technical sciences, professor and academician at  the International Engineering Academy in the field of  information sciences.    Sergey Konstantinovich Lopukhov completed the VAGSh of  the VAF [Military Academy imeni Frunze], and is a specialist in  the field of information sciences and management, a candidate of  military sciences and chief of an institute.    The dissemination of information technology in the armed  forces is the process of the creation, broad-scale incorporation  and application in various fields of activity of the armed  forces, under any conditions, of methods, system and means of  obtaining, gathering, processing, storing and using information.    A certain base of information technology has taken shape in  the armed forces, including automated systems of  command-and-control of troops (ASUV) and the computer centers of  staffs, as well as the computer capacity of the NIIs  [scientific-research institutes], VVUZs [higher military  educational institutions] and institutions of the armed forces.  The facilities, elements and command posts of the troops whose  officers have an affect to a certain extent on the combat  capabilities of the armed forces have been equipped with  automated systems first and foremost. The level of information  technology is considerably lower in the lower echelons of  command and control, supporting structures and in the social  realm.    The dissemination of information technology in the armed  forces as a whole is higher than average for the national  economy, since means of artificial intelligence have been  adopted more actively in the armed forces. An analysis of the  state of information technology in the armed forces shows, at  the same time, that its level does not conform in full to  contemporary methods and means of waging battle and the  requirements arising therefrom.    The principal shortcomings in information technology in the  armed forces of the Russian Federation are:    a sharp lag in information technology of lower levels  of command and control and, as a consequence, the absence of a  real information base;    the adoption of various hardware and software that are  not compatible;    the insufficient level of the capabilities and  characteristics of the computer technology being used, and the  low degree of saturation of subunits and services with modern  computer hardware;    the insufficient utilization in the armed forces of  contemporary achievements in the field of new information  technologies, methods of mathematical modeling and artificial  intelligence.    The topicality of information technology for the armed  forces  is explained by the growing role of information and the  necessity of reducing the time for the making of well-founded  decisions for their command and control under the new military  and political conditions, which envisage cutbacks in  conventional and strategic offensive weapons.    The necessity of information technology for the armed forces  is conditioned by the marked increase in the flows of  information in the command-and-control elements of the armed  forces and the value of the information, the increased  significance of the level of awareness of officers and the  well-foundedness of the decisions they make.    The dissemination of information technology in the armed  forces defines new views of the development of arms and military  hardware (VVT) and their robotization and intellectualization,  as well as improvements in the system of the command-and-control  of troops (forces) and weapons, and envisages the creation and  application of new information technologies and means of  information technology, the formation of an information  infrastructure for the armed forces, and the creation of  specialized information facilities for the efficient utilization  of information in all spheres of their activity. More than 50  percent of the time of the command-and-control cycle in the  armed forces of the United States, according to the estimates of  foreign specialists, is spent on the gathering, summary and  analysis of various information, while the making of decisions  is accomplished based on the use of only a small percentage of  the available information.    The principal directions and aims of the dissemination of  information technology in the armed forces are:    --in the field of military construction, the  fuller utilization of information resources for the scientific  substantiation of armed forces structures, their necessary size,  sophistication, development prospects and support, through the  broad-scale incorporation of modern means of information  technology for the accelerated use of the achievements of  science and technology in the interests of the armed forces,  predicting the military-political situation and performing  measures for the preparation of the armed forces and the country  as a whole to repel aggression, based on the development of  multifunctional information-management systems;    --in the field of armed combat, increasing the  effectiveness of the development of plans for the employment of  the armed forces, reducing the times and raising the quality of  decision-making in preparing for operations, and providing a  flexible response to changes in the military-political situation;    --in the field of command-and-control of the armed  forces, increasing the operativeness, reliability and  concealment of the command-and-control of troops (forces)  through the adoption of improved means of automation;    --in the field of supporting the troops, raising  the qualities, completeness and operativeness of all types of  support for the troops, under any conditions, through the  widespread and comprehensive incorporation of means of  information technology and new information technologies, and the  creation of favorable conditions with the aim of supporting the  everyday activity of units and subunits in peacetime for the  organized and timely conduct of operations under conditions of  the combat environment;    --in military-scientific activity, raising the  effectiveness of the fulfillment of scientific-research work on  the basis of equipping the subunits (units) for military  scientific information with the latest means of information  technology, uniting them into information networks, priority  research of problems in the preparation and waging of modern  operations and combat activity connected with the increasing  influence of information technologies, intensification of the  creation of new means of armed combat and command-and-control of  troops (forces) on the basis of qualitatively higher information  support, substantiation of efficient forms and methods of combat  preparation of the troops, and optimization of the ways of  achieving the required characteristics of arms and military  hardware;    --in the field of military education, military training  and indoctrination, a radical rise in the quality of  training of military specialists on the basis of efficient  information support for the tasks of training personnel,  creating an information-technological base for the restructuring  of military education through a deepening of scientific  research, the intensification and individualization of training,  and adaptation to the abilities of the trainees and the  activation of their creative potential;    --in the field of routine activities, raising the  quality of decision-making in the process of everyday activity  of the subunits, units and institutions of the armed forces, the  performance of garrison and guard duty, the escort of military  freight, the observance of regulation order and the  reinforcement of military discipline;    --in the military-legal and social realm, the  information technology of the armed forces pursue the aim of a  substantial rise in the quality of information-legal support for  the everyday activity of the troops, improvements in lawmaking  activity, and assurance of a greater level of awareness on  questions of social protections for servicemen and their  families.    The dissemination of information technology, along with the  development and improvement of traditional information  technologies, presupposes the adoption into the active practice  of the armed forces new information technologies that support  the automated resolution of poorly formalized tasks in various  fields of activity of the armed forces, including by a user who  does not have special training in the field of computers. The  new information technologies are the foundation for resolving  applied tasks in the command-and-control of troops, the creation  of robotized weapons systems, and the support of the everyday  activity of the troops, services, and the training of personnel.    The work on the dissemination of information technology in  the armed forces of the Russian Federation is being held back  for a number of objective reasons--the uncertainty of the paths  and stages of the reformation and development of the armed  forces and the incomplete nature of the development of the State  Program of Information Sciences for Russia, on the one hand, and  the fact that the principles and sources of financing of the  Program of Information Sciences for the armed forces has not  been resolved, on the other.    Analysis shows that the substantial development of means of  computer technology and information technology (SVTI), a  reduction of several times over in mass, dimensions and power  consumption and an increase in reliability by one or two orders  of magnitude will be required under the new conditions. Domestic  technologies for the development of SVTI still do not ensure the  rapid attainment of the indicated characteristics. One reason  for this situation is the technical policy that was pursued in  our country in the recent past--a preference for copying foreign  models. The creation of new computers in the Unified Series (YeS  computers), the System of Small Computers (SM computers) and  personal computers (PEVM) has proceeded and is proceeding along  that path. Primarily foreign-made computer hardware is being  used as a result to equip the staffs, command-and-control  elements (posts) and institutions of the armed forces of the  Russian Federation in the development and adoption of new  automated information systems, which is forcing significant  expenditures from the state budget. And until market-competitive  computer hardware is produced in the Russian Federation, those  expenses will increase owing to the necessity of replacing  functionally and physically obsolete series-produced models of  the YeS and SM computers.    The directions for the dissemination of information  technology in the armed forces also encompass priority problems,  within the framework of which the following tasks should be  resolved in the near future:    the gradual creation of a telecommunications  environment for the armed forces and its link-up with nationwide  communications and data-transmission systems, and the further  development of communications equipment;    the development and incorporation of base  problem-oriented systems, software and hardware for the  structuring of local and global information and computer  networks;    the fastest possible equipping of armed forces staffs  and organizations with base means of information technology and  personal computers, advanced communications and  telecommunications gear and improved organizational techniques  as the foundation for the adoption of "paperless" information  technologies;    the improvement of methods and tools for the  development of software and the use of CASE technologies,  without which progress in the creation and adoption of  subsequent generations of automated systems and ASUVs is  impossible;    assurance of the technical, information, linguistic and  program compatibility of the means of information technology;    improvement of the system of training, retraining and  skills enhancement of military specialists in the realm of  information technology;    the creation of standardized, advanced means of  information technology with a regard for the requirements of  ensuring the security of the information.    The strategy of information technology for the armed forces  and plans for the performance of the priority operations should  be defined in the Conceptual Framework for the Dissemination of  Information Technology in the armed forces and the Program of  Information Technology for the armed forces. Its realization  will occur under conditions of grave economic crisis in the  national economy as a whole, with all of the consequences  arising therefrom. The information technology policy for the  armed forces should inevitably be considered within the context  of the socio-economic policy of the state, reflecting the  specific features of the transition of the country to new  methods and mechanisms for the management of the national  economy under conditions of the emergence of a market economy.    The aspect of the management of this process from within  should exist alongside the state aspect of managing information  technology in the armed forces. Those areas of financing, in  other words, that will have the maximum impact under the  concrete conditions of the realization of the Program should be  defined within the framework of the amounts of financing  allocated by the state and the restrictions defined by law.    The specific nature of the armed forces does not permit the  Program to be fundamentally open for the participation of the  plans of various organizations on a competitive basis.  Considering that competitive selection is the most effective  means of formulating programs, and allowing that the involvement  of the civilian sector will make it possible to reduce expenses  to a substantial extent, however, the analysis and ranking of  all draft Programs by the degree of their openness is being  proposed, orienting most of them toward realization in both the  military and the civilian spheres, thereby ensuring the partial  or full recouping of the initial expenditures. The possibility  appears therein of preserving the strong scientific collectives  of military organizations through the credit financing of  additional projects in armed forces information technology.    The enterprises and organizations that are the consumers of  SVTI are not only not upgrading their computer capacity, but are  trying to get rid of existing capacity so as to reduce overhead;  that is, a policy of gains for the moment is being pursued. The  paramount development of the priority areas stipulated in the  Program of Information Technology for the armed forces of the  Russian Federation is required in particular in this regard,  providing a sharp rise in the quality of the computer hardware  being produced, out of the whole range of which only a few  directions merit consideration at the given moment (some  materials-intensive parts--the housings, boards, power sources  etc.) that could easily be reproduced under foreign  technologies. The backwardness of our microelectronics  technology is well known. The situation is aggravated by the  breakup of economic ties among the former union republics. About  50 percent of the enterprises in this field have remained on the  territory of Russia, and just 25 percent of the capacity of the  former USSR went to the republics. This need not necessarily  lead to a stoppage of production, but the output of modern and  complex computer hardware can be set up only after a certain  time interval and, most likely, only with the aid of foreign  partners.    The unification of the fragmented information-management  systems of the branches of the armed forces into a unified  system for the Ministry of Defense, provision for its  interaction with the information systems of the bodies of state  administration and, in particular, with the information systems  of the apparatus of the President and the Security Council, is  an urgent task for the armed forces of the Russian Federation  under prevailing military-political conditions. The material,  scientific and technical basis for this work should be improved  computer hardware and software support. The following basic  principles should be taken into account when structuring the  conceptual model for the unified information-management system  (YeIUS):    minimization of the material and financial expenditures  for the creation of the YeIUS;    the maximum utilization of available systems of  command-and-control, computers, communications and  data-transmission systems and scientific and technical  developments;    centralization of access to information contained in  the information and computer centers of the branches of the  armed forces and other command-and-control points;    coordination of information flows in the YeIUS being  created and the systems integrated with it according to uniform  requirements;    the creation of support points for the gathering,  study, depiction and analysis of data;    assurance of the basic principle of the  command-and-control of troops--the centralization of  command-and-control at all levels.    The information system being created within the apparatus of  the Ministry of Defense and General Staff of the armed forces  could be used as the foundation for creating this YeIUS.    The principal requirement toward the YeIUS is providing  information to all elements of command-and-control and  administrative leadership of the Ministry of Defense.    The accomplishment of the tasks enumerated above is  impossible without the creation of scientific, technical,  organizational and financial foundations of the  command-and-control system and the coordination of operations in  the realm of armed forces information technology. The following  measures would be expedient to pursue in these areas, in our  opinion:    1. A staff coordinating element--a Committee on Information  Technology for the armed forces--should be created under the  General Staff, answering directly for the resolution of issues  in the dissemination of information technology in the armed  forces.    Two independent elements could be formed under the Committee  for Information Technology of the armed forces: an Expert  Council and a Council of Chief Designers. The Expert Council  should be composed, as a rule, of leading specialists in the  field of information technology from the scientific-research  organizations of the Ministry of defense, while the Council of  Chief Designers should include representatives of the General  Staff of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation,  organizations in the defense sectors of industry and the  scientific-research organizations of the Russian Academy of  Sciences associated with the development of information  technologies and systems for military purposes.    2. It is essential to determine the General Customer and the  sources, principles and procedure for financing the work under  the program of Information Technology for the armed forces.    3. The creation of centers for the certification and funding  of software are also best created in order to provide quality  expert analysis of plans in the field of information technology  for the armed forces, assessments of the quality level of  information technologies being developed and systems and  individual pieces of equipment in information technology, for  the purpose of ensuring the compatibility of the means of  information technology being employed in the armed forces, and  on that basis the efficient making of financial expenditures for  the development and acquisition of the means of information  technology, as well as arms and military hardware that uses  information technologies.    The problem of the dissemination of information technology  in  the armed forces is thus becoming a priority one today,  determining both the look of the armed forces of the Russian  Federation and the principles for its combat application. The  economic expenditures for the realization of the Program of  Information Sciences will be recouped over a short time through  the marked increase in the efficiency of the performance of  defensive tasks by the armed forces of the Russian Federation.

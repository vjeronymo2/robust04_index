			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Pawel Wronski: "MON Proposals--Calls for a </F> Commander"]    [Text] According to National Defense Minister Piotr  Kolodziejczyk, the Polish Army needs a chief commander. He does  not know whether the commander will be subordinated to the  Ministry of National Defense [MON] or directly to the president.  Yesterday, the government adopted a draft of changes in the  Army prepared by MON.    The document entitled "Defense Problems and Military Aspects  of the Polish Republic's Security Policies" was debated by the  government during a secret meeting with the participation of  President Lech Walesa and General Tadeusz Wilecki, chief of the  General Staff. After it is approved by the president and the  Council of Ministers, the draft will be submitted to the Sejm  before the end of May.  <H5>  What Kind of Commander? </H5>   The draft says that the civilian defense minister will cease  being the Army's direct commander. A post of chief commander  will be established who will be responsible for training and  mobilization. He is supposed to be in charge of land forces,  air forces, the Navy, and the General Staff.    It is not known whether the chief commander will be  subordinated directly to the president or to the defense  minister. Minister Kolodziejczyk did not hide the fact that the  problem is of constitutional importance. "We leave the  resolution of this issue up to the politicians," he said.    According to Kolodziejczyk, the Sejm will find it easier to  approve the version under which the chief commander would be  subordinated to the minister. If the commander were to be  subordinated to the president, one would have to include that  function in the Constitution and make the commander responsible  for the Army's combat readiness. "The coalition will not agree  to tinkering with the Small Constitution while a `big  constitution' is still not in place," the MON chief explained to  journalists.    Up to now, it has seemed that the Belweder has striven to  have direct supervision over the Army and that the minister  supports these plans. But Minister Kolodziejczyk said yesterday  that the president's position on this issue is "very pragmatic."  "He is eager to establish the kind of system of commanding the  Army that would contain a safeguard protecting against  destabilization and sudden political changes," Kolodziejczyk  added. As an example, he cited the year 1992, when a conflict  occurred between the president and Minister Jan Parys.    "So the point is for the president to have supervision over  the chief commander?" asked confused journalists. "My  understanding was the opposite of that," Kolodziejczyk replied.  <H5>  What Kind of Guard? </H5>   The Belweder-promoted idea of establishing a National  Security Council as the chief organ of state security has been  postponed indefinitely. The argument was that, as Kolodziejczyk  explained it, one would have to "tinker with the Constitution."    Instead, the MON draft envisages the establishment of a  National Guard, of which the basis would be formed by several  thousand troops of the Internal Affairs Ministry's Nadwislanskie  Units. But the guard would be subordinated not to the  president, as the Belvedere wanted, but to civilian defense  (that is, to MON) and would provide assistance during natural  disasters, among others.  <H5>  What Kind of Army? </H5>   The document contains a list of legal acts concerning the  Army, which the Sejm should adopt in the immediate future, as  well as a report on the Army's technical condition. According  to the minister, the Army's technical condition is "dangerous,"  and Poland may lose its credibility. "Shortly, nobody will  simply appreciate us as a partner," the minister warned.</p>

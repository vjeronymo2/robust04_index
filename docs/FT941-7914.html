			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / IG Metall aims low in Lower Saxony action The decision by IG Metall, the German engineering union, to call a strike ballot in the state of Lower Saxony was dictated almost entirely by tactical reasons, union officials confirmed yesterday. More than anything else, the move underlines the extreme hesitancy with which the union is moving towards a strike, in the midst of the sharpest recession since the war and rapidly rising unemployment. It also indicates its desire to keep such action small-scale and geographically limited. "We do not want a big social conflict,' Mr Klaus Zwickel, the union leader, has said repeatedly. Gesamtmetall, the employers' federation, is much more sceptical. 'By avoiding total confrontation, and choosing a place where the pressure is not real, it suggests the action is more of a ritual than reality,' Mr Werner Rieck, the federation spokesman, said. Lower Saxony only has 90,000 engineering workers at some 230 companies, and the union would initially only call out 10,000-20,000, assuming the strike ballot votes at least 75 per cent in favour of strike action, which IG Metall takes for granted. In addition, the state's engineering companies are less dominated by suppliers of the motor industry, and other highly inter-related engineering activities, which would cause a rapid knock-on effect from strike action. IG Metall wants to avoid such effects because they could cause a backlash against the strike from fellow workers. Under new labour legislation, workers laid off or put on short-time working because of strike action do not qualify for any relief payments. Lower Saxony is also important for the union for two other vital reasons. In the first place, it is the home base of Volkswagen, the motor giant which has agreed a wage deal with the union along precisely the lines IG Metall wants from the engineering industry as a whole: a cut in working hours (to a four-day week) in exchange for job security. In the second place, the choice will immediately politicise the struggle, because state elections are due on March 13, one week after the strike is set to start. For their part, IG Metall officials are increasingly convinced that the employers do not want a rapid settlement, but are prepared to face a strike, in the hope of winning and forcing through a very different wage deal for the current year. It would be little more than a loose framework for plant level bargaining, with big moves to make working time more flexible - including longer hours, as well as shorter. Both sides believe there will be at least one final effort to reach a settlement, probably after the strike ballot has taken place on March 1-3. It gives them both a last chance to head off the stoppage in Lower Saxony, now scheduled for March 7. The danger for them both is that even if it starts small, the action could spread to the entire northern coastal region.</p>

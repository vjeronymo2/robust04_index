			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Today, on the eve of the Ukrainian Supreme  Council session, the Ukrainian president held a meeting with  people's deputies. Addressing those present, Leonid Kravchuk  said:    [Begin Kravchuk recording] [passage omitted] As for the 26  June elections, there is no common point of view on this issue  among the people at this point. An opinion is widely held by  power structures, local authorities, political circles, and  working teams that it is not expedient to hold the elections for  president as well as heads and deputy heads of local councils at  this time. This position was also endorsed in an address by a  group of deputies to the people and the president of Ukraine.  Since it was the Supreme Council that made a decision on early  presidential elections and the election of local councils, only  the Supreme Council can rescind it. As the president and a  presidential candidate in the next presidential elections, I  consider it necessary to explain my position on the June  elections to the deputies and some proposals concerning this  issue.    The situation that has take shape as a result of the  elections for president and local councils has three aspects --  political, economic, and legal. The political aspect. As you  know, some time ago, I actively supported the intention to hold  early presidential elections, seeing it as a way to assuage  political tension in the country. However, at this very time,  there is a great risk that the political campaign will not only  fail to soothe this tension, but hasten destabilizing processes  as well as the polarization of political forces and their  confrontation. An intensive campaign to elect the state's  leader will only step up the political fight, while today, we  need accord and mutual understanding to carry out socioeconomic  changes and emerge from the current crisis. Perhaps, it is not  by coincidence that many countries, especially in the CIS,  conclude agreements on civil peace, accord, and joint efforts to  preserve the state. This is of extraordinary importance for  Ukraine and presents a chance for saving the state. One should  take into consideration the arrangement of political forces in  the country and distinctive features of its regions, which would  inevitably divide people on the grounds of their attitude toward  presidential candidates. It is already clear that those  divisions will assume very acute forms and become an obstacle to  civil accord. A serious threat to state-building is the vague  status of local governments. The June elections are supposed to  determine an utterly new option for the Ukrainian state system.  Oblast and rayon councils receive the status of state bodies,  or to be more precise, a new and imperfect status of local  self-government bodies. As a matter of fact, it is an attempt to  introduce a federal type of state system because oblast councils  are given legislative powers. Their heads are elected directly  by the oblast's population and cannot be replaced without its  consent -- of course, if the established principles of  expressing people's will are respected. [passage omitted]    Supporting broad economic independence of the [Ukrainian]  regions, I am not going to use it as an excuse for dividing the  unified unitarian state into separate parts. The state's  federalization, unmatched by clearly defined constitutional  norms, well-considered current legislation, and mechanisms for  relations between the center and the hinterland, will make  society unmanageable. By the way, experience shows that it will  take years, not one month, to create legislation and adopt the  Constitution allowing Ukraine to become a federal state. I am  convinced that such large-scale transformations can only be done  based on a new constitution. In this particular case, I invoke  our national experience. Everyone knows that contradictions  between Ukraine and the Crimea were caused by the fact that the  Constitution does not specify relations between the country as a  whole and its autonomous territory. Now, we are faced with the  threat of spreading this kind of tension to all Ukrainian  oblasts, which may trigger a political crisis. So there are  serious grounds to believe that the June elections, in spite all  good intentions, can lead to abrupt changes in society and put  the state-building process in jeopardy. I am confident that one  should at first adopt relevant constitutional principles and lay  the legal base, and then launch political reforms. [passage  omitted] [end recording]</p>

			<p><P> February 15, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT : JAZZ / DIRK SUTRO: CONNORS, HENDERSON TAKE A DETOUR BACK  TO JAZZ ROOTS  </P> <P> Drummer Norman Connors and singer/bassist Michael Henderson did some of their  most important work as pioneers of electric jazz/rock/funk fusion in the '70s.  But in the '80s, they found success as purveyors of the music known in the  industry as "quiet storm," the soft, romantic R&amp;B of singers like Whitney  Houston, Anita Baker and Luther Vandross.  </P> <P> This Sunday, Connors and Henderson bring their bands to Smokey's in Mission  Valley for shows at 7:30 p.m. and 10:30 p.m. Lest jazz fans think there's  nothing in it for them, Connors said the live dates are much different than his  honey-dripping self-produced albums.  </P> <P> "My direction is jazz, similar to Quincy (Jones)," he said. "I come from a jazz  background, I studied jazz and classical music. We always play some jazz. I  always start off the show doing Coltrane's 'Naima,' Miles (Davis), Herbie  (Hancock). Then, when the singers come out, we play our vocal hits."  </P> <P> Connors' pre-fusion jazz work was on the edge. He worked with Archie Shepp,  Jack McDuff, Jackie McLean, Sam Rivers and Charles Erler before joining Pharoah  Sanders' group in 1971. His pioneering fusion album was the 1972 "Dance of  Magic" with Hancock, Stanley Clarke, Ron Carter, Hubert Laws, Gary Bartz,  Airto, Ron Carter and Hubert Laws.  </P> <P> Although his last album, "Passion," includes several of the pulsing, romantic  ballads that have brought him commercial success, there are also tunes like the  title track, in which Marion Meadows' electrified, Contrane-like soprano sax is  layered over dreamy, funk rhythms.  </P> <P> Connors has always had great singers in his groups. His current band features  Spencer Harrison, a baritone with a voice Connors described as "somewhere  between Peabo Bryson and Jeffrey Osborne," and Gabrielle Goodman, a former  backup singer for Roberta Flack whose early training was in jazz.  </P> <P> Henderson and Connors made their last album together -- "You Are My Starship"  -- in 1977. It went platinum.  </P> <P> Some of Henderson's most intense jazz training came during his seven years with  Miles Davis. Henderson grew up with the gritty sounds of Detroit, and by the  mid-'60s, was one of the top session players during the "Golden Era" at Motown  Records. He has toured with Stevie Wonder and Aretha Franklin, and played with  Marvin Gaye, the Temptations, the Supremes and the Four Tops.  </P> <P> Henderson and Connors' best known hit together was their recording of  Henderson's song "Valentine Love."  </P> <P> How will the evening unfold?  </P> <P> "Michael's group will play, then I'll play. At the end, we'll all get together,  like a gumbo soup," Connors said.  </P> <P> San Diegans most often hear Ron Satterfield as half of the successful local  band Checkfield, whose music has become a mainstay of light jazz and adult  contemporary radio. But Satterfield is also an accomplished straight-ahead jazz  man, as he'll be proving Sunday and Monday nights through March 26 at the  Marine Room in La Jolla.  </P> <P> Satterfield and top local flutist Holly Hofmann are using a variety of  material, including Hofmann's compositions, lots of Antonio Carlos Jobim and  several Frank Sinatra songs.  </P> <P> Satterfield plays several instruments, but for these dates, he's bringing only  his guitar and voice.  </P> <P> Checkfield's new album, "A View from the Edge," featuring Satterfield and  partner John Archer, is due out March 1. Hofmann's next, titled "Further  Adventures," and using Mike Wofford on piano, Sherman Ferguson on drums and Bob  Magnusson on bass, is also due in March.  </P> <P> Last time he was here, temperamental sax man Gato Barbieri blitzed the  Bacchanal with a set that leaned too heavy on ear-shredding volume, too light  on musicianship. Barbieri, who played free jazz with Don Cherry before finding  a more Latin sound, appears once again at the Bacchanal this Friday night.  Depending on how he reacts to the idea, Barbieri may be joined on stage not  only by his band, but by the Japanese artist Rocco, who is visiting San Diego  and who often paints large, spontaneous murals to the accompaniment of live  jazz.  </P> <P> For Grammy night next Wednesday, the Catamaran Resort Hotel's Cannibal Bar will  present the awards program on a large screen television, with local jazz man  Hollis Gentry interjecting some live music. The Catamaran has been hit hard by  last year's demise of KSWV-FM (102.9), "The Wave." The club had been drawing  crowds of up to 300 for its regular jazz nights hosted by KSWV deejay Art Good,  promoted heavily on "The Wave." Good is back hosting the occasional "Jazz Trax"  nights with his former employer, KIFM (98.1), and business is much slower,  according to Catamaran general manager George Harrington. The Catamaran  originally left KIFM's "Lites Out" jazz club circuit to become the only club  with a regular jazz night promoted by KSWV. With KIFM again, the Catamaran  can't get its old Wednesday night "Lites Out" slot back -- it was given to the  Del Mar Hilton. Harrington is crossing his fingers that the Hilton will "go  away" so he can officially rejoin the "Lites Out" circuit, with its  commensurate crowd-drawing radio promos.  </P> <P> RIFFS: Mark your calendar now for Elario's list of coming jazz heavies: Feb.  21-25, Red Rodney; Feb. 28 to March 11, Scott Hamilton and Dave McKenna; March  28 to April 8, Art Farmer; April 11 to 15, Harry (Sweets) Edison; April 18 to  May 6, Papa John Creach; May 9-13, Charlie Haden's Quartet West, featuring  Ernie Watts; May 16-20, Freddie Hubbard; June 6-10, David (Fathead) Newman;  June 13-17, James Moody; June 27 to July 1, Anita O'Day.

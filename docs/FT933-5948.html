			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / Life under Bush better than it seemed: What lies behind the biggest upward revision in American GDP figures in 20 years LIFE WAS better than it seemed during the Bush years. That, at least, is the conclusion of federal statisticians who today announced one of the biggest upward revisions to US gross domestic product in 20 years. According to the new figures, the recession of 1990/91 was rather a mild affair, with gross domestic product falling only 1.6 per cent in real terms from peak to trough, compared with a previous estimate of a decline of 2.2 per cent. The recovery that began in the second quarter of 1991 was a lot stronger than previously suspected with real GDP growth averaging 2.4 per cent at an annual rate rather than 2 per cent. For the three years from the fourth quarter of 1989 to the fourth quarter of 1992, real growth was 55 per cent stronger than previously estimated: an average annual rate of 1.4 per cent rather than 0.9 per cent. The most striking revision was to 1992. In the year to the fourth quarter of 1992, the economy grew by a robust 3.9 per cent in real terms. Yet these were the months when candidate Bill Clinton successfully portrayed George Bush as a president who had failed the nation economically. In the final quarter of last year, the economy surged ahead with real growth at an annual rate of 5.7 per cent, rather than the 4.7 per cent previously reported, the swiftest growth since the end of 1987 when the Reagan 'boom' was still underway. The most important factor in the revisions was large upward adjustments to the figures on consumer spending on durable goods other than vehicles - for example furniture, household equipment and clothes. These revisions in turn mainly reflect new information from the Census Bureau which has just updated its series for retail sales, an exercise undertaken every five years. The other main upward revisions were for corporate expenditure on non-residential fixed investment and for state and local government spending. The re-writing of economic history did not just affect GDP. The new figures contradict claims that personal incomes stagnated during the Bush years. After allowing for inflation, personal disposable income grew at an annual rate of 2.2 per cent between the fourth quarters of 1989 and 1992, not 1.3 per cent as originally estimated. Corporate profits were also revised up sharply for each of the past three years. In some sectors the revisions were huge. For example profits made by financial companies were revised up by 38 per cent in 1991 and 42.5 per cent last year. It seems that banks, savings and loans institutions and life assurance companies were all financially stronger than previously estimated. Last, Americans were a bit more thrifty than economists thought. The personal savings rate last year was 5.3 per cent, not high, but better than the 4.8 per cent at first estimated. The statistical revisions also cast new light on the surge in growth at the end of last year. To a considerable degree it reflected the bringing forward of income from this year to avoid the expected increase in personal taxation in President Clinton's first budget. Statisticians had expected some Wall Street companies to bring forward bonuses to avoid higher top rates of tax this year. They therefore made allowance for an extra Dollars 1.5bn in accelerated bonus payments. It now appears that tax avoidance was a national phenomenon affecting scores of different industries. The latest estimates indicate that bonus payments to the tune of Dollars 19bn (0.3 per cent of GDP) were brought forward from this year and paid in the final months of the Bush administration. The swollen bonus payments significantly distorted the personal income figures and help explain why real consumer spending on durables grew at a staggering annual rate of 13 per cent in the final quarter of last year. The biggest puzzle raised by the revised figures is why public perceptions of the economy were so weak in recent years. The conventional wisdom is that it reflects the lack of job creation. But this is only a partial answer because the jobs figures have also been revised recently to show a smaller drop during the recession and a stronger rebound during the subsequent recovery. The current jobless rate of 6.8 per cent is not high by international standards, or by US standards for much of the 1980s. The answer seems to lie in dashed expectations. Even after the revisions, growth since the recession has averaged less than 2.5 per cent at an annual rate, a far cry from the rocket-like acceleration of growth experienced in nearly all the previous post-war US business cycles.</p>

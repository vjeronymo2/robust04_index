			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Peter Grolig: "Yugoslav Mafia Financed War"] </F>   [Text] The war in the former Yugoslavia does not just cost  blood and lives; enormous sums are being spent to be able to  continue the killing. The financiers of this madness get their  money partly from crime -- and Austria is playing an important  role as a country where the crimes are being committed and as a  switching station.    Thus, for months members of the Task Force for Combating  Organized Crime (EDOK) in the Interior Ministry, with the help  of domestic and foreign security authorities, has been pursuing  a gang of Serbs who have, so to speak, become heirs to the  infamous "Yugoslav Mafia."    Crimes, which usually are drowned in statistics, have  suddenly became particularly important, because the perpetrators  were able to afford luxurious life-styles because of break-ins,  car smuggling, protection racketeering, drug trafficking, arms  dealing, as well as pick-pocketing and robbery, but a large part  of the money gained in this way was passed on to Belgrade -- to  Serbian politicians and military, it has emerged from  interrogations.    Particularly coveted were "noncash means of payment": Since  1992, one of the bosses of the gang said, he had taken over  about 1,500 bank and traveler cheques stolen all over Europe.  Per month! Female couriers smuggled the loot across the  international borders.    Mafia experts in Milan forged the signatures and turned the  cheques into money, using forged Serbian, Czech, and Italian  personal documents. Just for this one branch, Zajim Sabanagic,  33, established special "acquisition" and "utilization  structures," among others in Belgium, Germany, France, and  Austria. His painstaking accounts of the criminal deals would  have "been a credit for any bank" (an investigator).    A total of 1,500 cheques (value about 3.5 million  schillings)  were recovered in one go. The damage (only in this field) is  estimated to be at least 100 million schillings.    An interesting detail gained from the interrogations: When  the officials asked Sabanagic about his accounts, two of which  were known through surveillance, he pretended not to know  anything. "Then we will send the money that we found to Bosnia,"  the policemen bluffed. The Serb confessed and promised to help  making good the damage with "his" assets.    "We have managed to land the biggest blow so far against  organized crime," enthused Walter Pretzner, head of EDOk, which  was founded only a year ago. His summary of 35 arrests and 150  reports to the police:    Crimes involving more than 20 million schillings have been  solved. They include 20 cases of car smuggling, robberies (a  bank robbery in Vienna as well as a brutal attack on German  campers in France), and 40 break-ins in villas -- for instance  the one in the villa of Vienna Court President Guenther  Woratsch, when, among other things, a gun was stolen at  Christmas 1992. In this connection, a search is under way for  Ratko Bjelobaba, 36, who also cashed cheques, and Goran Sojic,  28. Inquiries sent to the Belgrade police have produced no  results.</p>

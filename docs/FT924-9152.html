			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / Thai group to invest Dollars 1bn in Guangdong A Thai conglomerate announced yesterday it had signed a deal to undertake a Dollars 1bn forestry and pulp and paper project in southern China's Guangdong province, in what it said was the largest Thai investment so far in China, writes Victor Mallet in Bangkok. Soon Hua Seng group (SHS), an unlisted company which boasts of being the biggest rice and tapioca exporter in the world, signed an agreement with the state-controlled Forestry and Paper Mill Co of Shanwei City to plant trees and build wood chip and pulp and paper plants which will eventually employ 4,000 people. SHS said it would start planting eucalyptus and acacia trees next year on 32,000 hectares of land to be rented from the Shanwei government. Construction of the wood chip plant would begin in 1997 or 1998, and the building of the pulp and paper factory would start in 1999. Production was expected to start in 10 years.</p>

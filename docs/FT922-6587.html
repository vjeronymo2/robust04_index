			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Political lobbying over Midland takeover gathers steam - MPs with a specialist or constituency interest are lining up behind Hongkong / The battle for Midland WITH competing attractions like Maastricht, Olympia &amp; York and the Maxwell pensioners, the battle for Midland is not at the top of most MPs' agendas. Nevertheless, the lobbying offensive mounted by the protagonists is beginning to bear fruit. MPs with constituency interests are starting to think through the possible local consequences of what is proposed. Meanwhile, those whose special interests include financial services are considering the ways in which this case will affect competition, employment and merger regulation. Among the first group are a large number of MPs fearful that a Lloyds Bank takeover of Midland could produce significant job losses in their constituencies. Some of these have signed an early day motion supporting Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corporation's plans which was tabled at Westminster by Mr Jacques Arnold, the Conservative MP for Gravesham and a former Midland employee. In all, 61 Tory, Labour and Plaid Cymru MPs have backed the motion. Of these, it is Labour MPs in Sheffield like Mr Richard Caborn and Mr Clive Betts who articulate perhaps the most pressing local interest. Midland is now the biggest private-sector employer in the erstwhile steel capital of the world. Some 1,750 of the bank's 2,500 local staff are employed in the type of head office functions that are perceived to be vulnerable in the event of a Lloyds takeover. Mr Caborn says luring Midland 'gave a confidence to the city that has enabled it to attract other financial institutions'. According to Mr Betts, 'the worrying thing is that there has been no discussion about the implications in Sheffield'. Lloyds, which admits that 20,000 jobs might be lost - the vast majority, it claims, on a voluntary basis - if it took over Midland, retorts that it would take the best from both banks. Midland employees in Sheffield would be retained if their performance warranted it. The bank further contends that retrenchment is inevitable and ongoing in 'overbanked' Britain. It would be better for this process to unfold on a planned rather than a haphazard basis, as it argued at a recent meeting with a small group of senior Tory backbenchers. Hongkong Bank - which has arguably adopted the more aggressive tactics in these early lobbying exchanges - is now attempting to build on these expressions of support by circulating material detailing where a Lloyds-Midland merger would damage competition by causing branch closures. Its advisers have unearthed 28 constituencies - including those represented by Mr Michael Heseltine, President of the Board of Trade, Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour party leader, and Mr Douglas Hogg, junior foreign office minister  -which they say contain towns faced with a 'prospective monopoly' of bank branches since they currently boast only one Midland and one Lloyds outlet. Lloyds and Midland between them own more than 50 per cent of bank branches in nine postal areas or counties, including Gloucestershire, Warwickshire and West Glamorgan, the material claims. Lloyds discounts the research on the grounds it is inaccurate, makes no reference to other financial outlets such as building societies, and does not indicate whether Midland proposes closing any of the branches mentioned anyway under its own plans. Midland is also attempting to rally Westminster support to the Hongkong banner by encouraging its employees to write 'from your home address' to their local MPs urging them to sign Mr Arnold's early day motion. 'Using your own words, expressing deep concern as a Midland employee on what the Lloyds approach would mean for jobs and customer choice, you should ask your MP . . . to sign Early Day Motion No. 39,' a letter signed by Mr Brian Pearse, chief executive, and addressed 'Dear Colleague', advises. 'If your customers offer to assist, you can suggest they might like to take the same course of action.' However, some MPs who support Hongkong see shortcomings in making a stark distinction between the two sides' proposals in terms of future employment prospects. 'The employment argument is a weak one,' says Mr Tim Devlin, the Conservative MP for Stockton South and a signatory to the Arnold motion. He says Britain has 'far too many' bank branches and staff. 'The argument has got to be on competition; if Lloyds and Midland go in together that will reduce the number of mainstream banks.' Mr Peter Viggers, the Tory MP for Gosport, has singled out the regulatory aspects of the present position as a cause for concern, calling for both sets of proposals to be examined 'under the same jurisdiction'. Although his stance on this mirrors that of Lloyds, Mr Viggers says he is not taking sides 'at this point'. He says a number of colleagues 'feel dissatisfaction' that the Hongkong bid is being examined by the European Commission.</p>

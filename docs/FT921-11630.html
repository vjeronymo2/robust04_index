			<p>920130 FT  30 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: WH Smith Even by their own long-term standards, shares in WH Smith have been unusually strong of late. Since last May's Pounds 148m rights issue, they have beaten the market by 30 per cent and are at their highest ever against the retailing sector. Judging by yesterday's interim results and increased dividend, the market has been right to put a premium on the group's defensive characteristics. The question is whether Smith will maintain its rating once the economy picks up. Granted, the interim figures depended heavily on the rights issue cash, which brought down the interest charge to less than Pounds 3m against five times that in the same period last year. The underlying trading performance was still respectable, particularly in the WH Smith chain itself. The only real worry remains Do It All, which may complete its integration just in time for a price war among the big chains. With recovery in the housing market still a distant prospect, it may be left to the group's other specialist retail brands to make the running. Investors might deduce that although Smith is as well positioned to prosper as any of its high street rivals, the shares look fully valued.</p>

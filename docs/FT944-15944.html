			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: For those with a special affinity to plastic - A look at the growth of credit cards from organisations seeking a more personal touch What do the plastic contents of your wallet say about you? Are you a Porsche driver? A Burberry wearer? A Manchester United fan? A Sunday Times reader? Perhaps a a National Trust member or a supporter of the Canine Defence League? For the past few years, letter boxes throughout Britain have been stuffed with mail shots offering colourful credit cards that proclaim your attachment to an organisation or a brand name. Hundreds of these 'affinity' cards are available in the UK. They cover every conceivable kind of organisation: charities, professional bodies, trade unions, universities, newspapers, motor manufacturers, and amorphous interest groups such as anglers, gardeners and golfers. Affinity cards work just like normal Visa or Mastercards and are issued by banks, but their designs are specific to the organisation concerned and made attractive so that holders are encouraged to use them. Many carry no annual fee, or waive it if the card is used more than 10 times a year or for spending more than Pounds 1,500 or Pounds 2,000 annually. Some, particularly from the smaller issuers, have lower interest rates than standard bank credit cards. MBNA's annual percentage rate is 17.9, or 13.9 per cent on cash advances. Beneficial Bank's rates vary from 17.5 per cent (Law Society and Institute of Directors) to 21.9 per cent (Manchester United and British Sub Aqua Club). Charities have been particularly active in promoting affinity cards because they provide an extra source of revenue, even though the sums involved are not large. Typically, a charity (or other organisation) will receive about Pounds 5 when a supporter signs up, then 0.25 per cent of what is spent. So, if someone spends Pounds 500 a month, the charity will get Pounds 1.25, or Pounds 15 over the year. This is not a great deal - but the charity does also get a mailing list of very sympathetic names. The range of affinity cards in the UK has not yet reached the scale of the US, where a quarter of credit cards involve some affinity or partnership arrangement. Some American towns even have their own cards to bring in non-tax income, and middle-aged rockers can pay for their CDs with a Rolling Stones credit card - complete with lips logo. The UK is catching up rapidly, though. Those who are proud to wear their political colours on their sleeves - or in their pockets - are well catered for. The Royal Bank of Scotland runs the Conservative party credit card, while the Co-operative Bank juggles with both the Liberal Democrats and the Labour party. Plaid Cymru and the Scottish National party have yet to join the plastic society. Design is important. The University of Cambridge card (Beneficial Bank) carries a picture of the Senate House, the only building used by all university members - a picture of one of the colleges would have alienated graduates of all the rest. Likewise, the Jaguar card has a striking picture of the big cat rather than a specific model, and the MG Owners' Club card is illustrated with a vintage car. The success of an affinity card depends not only on how many potential card-holders a group has but also on how keen they are to be associated publicly with the group. This could vary: as the proud owner of a Tottenham Hotspur Visa card, (Beneficial Bank), you might think twice about using it near a rival ground. Some cards are aspirational: you do not necessarily have to own a Burberry coat or Porsche car to be able to flash its logo around on a credit card. And a few offer extra perks. The Bank of Scotland entices applicants for its gardeners' card with a free seed catalogue. Holders of Burberry Visa cards (MBNA) earn points towards a discount on their next purchase, while applicants for Toyota or Lexus cards (MBNA) get the chance to win a new Toyota Corolla car. The 35 trade union cards offered by the Bank of Scotland charge a lower interest rate than the bank's other affinity cards but, in return, the unions forego the usual Pounds 5 donation for each new card-holder. The Ford Barclaycard and GM Card (HFC Bank) are slightly different - they are 'co-branded' commercial cards, rather than affinity cards. Their aim is to promote brand loyalty by letting users earn substantial rebates on new Ford or Vauxhall vehicles.</p>

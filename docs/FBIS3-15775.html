			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Journalist Arkadiy Dubnov incorporating telephone </F> interview with Haji Akhbar Turajonzoda, former head of Tajik  Muslims, in Tehran; date of interview not given: "Tajik  Opposition Reaches Mutual Understanding With Russian Diplomats  But Not With Russian Military"]    [Text] The Tehran meetings between Tajik opposition  leaders and Anatoliy Adamishin, Russian first deputy foreign  minister, were successful.    The first round of talks between the Tajik Government and  the  opposition will take place in Moscow. The subsequent rounds are  due to be held in Iran and Afghanistan in order to give due  credit to the efforts of these countries, which have assisted  national reconciliation in Tajikistan. In addition, their  observers, like observers from Russia, Pakistan, and the United  Nations, are due to attend the talks themselves. The leader of  the Tajik opposition delegation will be Haji Akhbar Turajonzoda,  former head of the Tajik Muslims.    On behalf of the Russian leadership Adamishin guaranteed the  delegation members' complete safety during their stay in Moscow.  But opposition leaders are concerned for the safety of their  families living in Tajikistan, especially bearing in mind that  they themselves have been declared state criminals by the  Dushanbe authorities.    The interlocutors agreed that for the duration of the talks  a  moratorium must be imposed on hostilities both on the  Tajik-Afghan border and inside Tajikistan.    But the plans of the command of the CIS coalition  peacekeeping forces in Tajikistan to hold military exercises in  the near future on the territory of the unique "Tiger Gully"  nature reserve and to carry out deterrent actions against the  population of the Garm group of districts in the republic are  being seen by the opposition as an attempt to wreck the talks.    I contacted former spiritual leader Turajonzoda by telephone  in Tehran and asked him a few questions.    [Dubnov] We know about your statement that you do not aspire  to political power in Tajikistan and that the new transitional  coalition leadership must include professionals untainted by  participation in the armed struggle of Tajiks among themselves.  Can you see such people in the current Tajik leadership?    [Turajonzoda] I have no doubt that there are now such decent  people in the Tajik Government. This question was not discussed  in the meetings with Mr. Adamishin.    [Dubnov] Will you be able to guarantee control over  opposition gunmen in order to observe the truce for the duration  of the talks?    [Turajonzoda] I can give an absolute guarantee. This is  where we differ from the Dushanbe regime, which even now is  incapable of coping with its own armed formations in  Kurgan-Tyube Oblast.    [Dubnov] How do you assess the role of Russian diplomats and  military personnel in the Tajik-Tajik truce?    [Turajonzoda] We are very grateful to the Russian Foreign  Ministry for the meeting held in Tehran. We were ready for it  even during the last eight months. Russia has finally  recognized its own interests and its historical place in the  region, and we fully recognize its geopolitical importance here.  Friendly relations with democratic Russia, where human rights  and ethnic minorities' rights are respected, are entirely in our  interests.    As regards the Russian military, we very much regret that  some of them are not interested in a peaceful solution to the  Tajik problem and are even trying to sow discord among  opposition forces in Tajikistan. In doing so they are possibly  pursuing their own aims. Mr. Adamishin also recognized in  conversations with us that military personnel in Tajikistan  often exceed their functions, and confirmed instances of their  interference in the intra-Tajik conflict.    [Dubnov] How soon can the Tajik-Tajik talks take place?    [Turajonzoda] That must be determined by the UN secretary  general's special representative; we are ready to begin them at  any time.</p>

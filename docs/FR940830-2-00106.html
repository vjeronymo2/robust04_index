			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The banking industry expects that stored value cards will be used in many other types of transactions in the foreseeable future. Pilot projects are under way for use of stored value cards with merchants, in vending machines, and at laundromats. While the stored value cards in use today are often paper with a magnetic stripe, these cards are generally expected to be made of more durable material and function through an internal integrated circuit, or ``chip,'' and are often referred to as ``smart cards.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The comments dealing with this subject suggested that EPS could unlawfully maintain its monopoly in access to regional ATM networks, or extend its geographic scope, through regulations on the stored value feature of hybrid ATM/stored value cards issued by members of its ATM network.These commenters suggested that the proposed Final Judgment could contain various restrictions on the ability of EPS to issue such regulations. <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Citicorp suggested that the defendant could block entry of competing smart card networks by imposing technical restrictions (presumably covering communications format, hardware or software) on MAC members that create incompatibilities between their ATMs and non-MAC smart cards. Citicorp notes that EPS currently uses a smart card technology different from some competing smart cards. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A similar situation could have, but did not, arise with respect to ATM cards when they were introduced in the 1970s. There is no inherent reason to believe that such a situation will arise with respect to smart cards. While Citicorp's observations may be correct, detailed regulation of smart card operations and technology is not necessary or possible at the present time. As discussed below, if anticompetitive practices develop as smart cards are introduced, action can be taken at the appropriate time. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section IV.H of the proposed Final Judgment prohibits EPS from restricting the branding of ATMs with the marks of networks in addition to MAC, and likewise enjoins EPS from restricting the branding of ATM cards with the marks of multiple networks by banks in certain states. A later clause in Section IV.H provides that, ``notwithstanding the preceding, Defendant *&blank;*&blank;* may restrict the branding of access cards that contain an integrated circuit computer chip with a stored value function.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The effect of this clause is to exclude the branding of the stored value function from the injunction against restrictions on multiple branding of cards. EPS may, within the limits of antitrust and other applicable laws, restrict the branding of ``stand-alone'' stored value cards (cards having no ATM functions) and the stored value function of ``hybrid'' ATM/stored value cards. EPS may not, however, restrict the branding of stand-alone ATM cards or the ATM functions of hybrid cards, nor may EPS defeat the injunction against restrictions on dual branding by converting ATM functions to integrated circuit technology. <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  The clause is necessary since in its absence paragraph IV.H could be interpreted to enjoin EPS from restricting the branding of both the stored value function and the ATM functions of hybrid cards. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> For purposes of the proposed Final Judgment, it is irrelevant whether the ATM functions in a card are carried out by a magnetic stripe or an integrated circuit. The obligations of EPS are not affected by the method of ATM access. The clause permitting restrictions on the branding of stored value functions is limited to chip-based stored value functions because that was the limit of the exception EPS sought. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Any other construction would lead to results not intended by the proposed Final Judgment. As discussed in the Competitive Impact Statement, the goal of Paragraph IV.H of the proposed Final Judgment is to ensure that MAC member depository institutions can participate in non-MAC ATM networks in practice as well as in theory. To that end, EPS must permit a member's ATM cards to function in the other networks in which that member participates; EPS cannot block these cards from functioning in multiple networks. In general, cardholders are aware of such multiple network functionality primarily because their ATM cards carry the brands of the relevant networks. If the clause were interpreted to allow EPS to restrict the branding of both the stored value and the ATM features of hybrid ATM/stored value cards, the result would be that these hybrid cards would function as ATM cards in another network (as required by the proposed Final Judgment) but would carry no brand for that network. Cardholders would thus be unaware of their ability to access this network, and would not use the card for that purpose. This result_cards with ``hidden'' functionalty_was not intended by either party to the proposed Final Judgment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The United States is not aware of any current multiple branding restrictions on stand-alone stored value cards or the stored value function of hybrid ATM/stored value cards in the MAC network. Nothing in the proposed Final Judgment, or any other document filed by the United States in this action, should be interpreted as evidencing a conclusion by the United States that such restrictions would or would not be a violation of the antitrust laws. Contrary to the observation in a comment filed by Chemical Bank, the proposed Final Judgment does not give EPS the ``right'' to issue such regulations; rather, EPS continues to be bound by the antitrust laws and any other applicable laws. If such regulations are issued and prove to be an antitrust violation, they can and would be challenged at the appropriate time. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. POS Issues <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Comments filed by MPS, Money Station and an anonymous source argued that the proposed Final Judgment should apply to access to point-of-sale (``POS'') network services as well as access to regional ATM network services. <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  As previously noted, the investigation conducted by the United States concluded that EPS had unlawfully maintained a monopoly in access to regional ATM network services in certain geographic areas. It did not determine whether EPS had market power in POS services, or whether the conduct of EPS in relation to its POS network business constituted an antitrust violation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> POS terminals are generally located in the establishments of merchants. They accept an ATM card and, using the ATM network or a parallel POS-only network, access the cardholder's account to transfer funds to the merchant's account. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As explained more fully in the Complaint and Competitive Impact Statement, MAC has maintained its monopoly in access to regional ATM network services in part by preventing the use of third party processors by its member depository institutions. It is the understanding of the United States that EPS does not forbid the use of third party processors in its POS network. <FOOTCITE>41</FOOTCITE>  Moreover, although the comments noted that EPS was a significant supplier of POS network services and suggested that it might exercise its strength in this area to maintain its monopoly in access to ATM network services, none of the comments indicated that EPS was taking any action of this type. <FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>  Nevertheless, the proposed Final Judgment does not, as argued by Money Station, leave EPS ``free'' to place restrictions on the use of POS services by MAC members. Rather, EPS is bound by the antitrust laws and other applicable laws. If the conduct of EPS in the provision of POS network services constitutes an antitrust violation, it can and would be challenged at the appropriate time. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> MPS compared the fees charged by EPS to and for the use of third party processors in its POS network with the cap set by the proposed Final Judgment on fees to and for the use of third party processors in its ATM network. While the comment noted that fees were higher in the POS network, this in and of itself does not establish that third party processors are unable to operate in the POS network, nor does it establish that EPS has monopoly power in access to POS network services. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Money Station noted that EPS could conceivably forbid MAC members to join other POS networks, or that it could forbid the use of third party POS processors by its members. While such conduct could constitute an antitrust violation, there is no allegation that EPS has taken such action. The United States is not prepared to speculate as to whether EPS will issue regulations on the use of POS network or processing services by its members, nor upon the content of any such regulations. Such regulations can be challenged if and when they are instituted. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

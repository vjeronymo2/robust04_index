			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 10 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Premier Li  Peng said today that no matter how the international arena  changes, China will uphold the five principles of peaceful  coexistence and develop friendly relations and cooperation with  the rest of the world.    Li Peng made the remark here while delivering a government  work report to the annual session of the Eighth National  People's Congress.    China will always be a reliable force for the preservation  of  regional and world peace and will never seek hegemony, Li added.    In his report, the premier elaborated on the current  international situation, the relationship between China and  other countries and China's principled stands on many major  international issues.    On the international situation, Li Peng said that the world  is moving increasingly towards multipolarity. In general, the  international situation is becoming more relaxed, and  development is now a more prominent issue. Economic interest is  becoming a primary consideration in international relations.  Peoples around the world share a common aspiration for the  relaxation of tensions, cooperation, development and progress.    However, the world is far from tranquil. The major tasks for  the international community are still to maintain world peace  and promote economic development, Li added.    He said, "in this complicated and changing international  situation, China has unswervingly pursued an independent foreign  policy of peace and has made fresh progress in its diplomatic  work. It has continuously expanded its friendly relations and  cooperation with other countries, and its prestige has steadily  grown. It has played an important role in maintaining world  peace and promoting economic development."    Recalling the further strengthened good-neighborly relations  with surrounding countries, the premier said the friendship  between China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has  grown. The mutually beneficial cooperation with Japan, Russia  and the Republic of Korea has been steadily expanded. China has  also made new progress in its relations with countries in  Southeast, South and Central Asia.    At the same time, Li said, China's friendly relations and  cooperation with other Asian countries and with the great number  of developing countries in Africa, Latin America and the South  Pacific have developed further.    Li Peng said that relations between China and the West  European countries and the European Community have again been  improved. Sino-German relations have entered a new stage of  development and a new chapter has been opened in Sino-French  relations. There are broad prospects for economic cooperation  and trade between China and the west European countries, and so  long as the two sides work together, bilateral relations between  China and each of those countries will continue to grow.    Normal and stable relations between China and the United  States not only serve the fundamental interests of the two  peoples but also contribute to peace and stability in the  Asia-Pacific region and in the world at large, Li Peng said.    He said, "we should consider these relations from a global  perspective, looking beyond this century. We maintain that  differences should be settled through dialogue on the basis of  mutual respect. So long as the principles stipulated in the  three Sino-U.S. joint communiques are strictly abided by and  efforts are made to enhance confidence, reduce trouble, expand  cooperation and avoid confrontation, Sino-U.S. relations will  continue to improve and expand."    As a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council, Li Peng  said, China has actively participated in international affairs  and played a positive role in such matters as settling  international disputes through peaceful means, protecting the  environment and promoting social progress.    China stands for expanded economic cooperation and trade,  enhanced South-South cooperation and North-South dialogue. It  advocates the complete prohibition and destruction of all  weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear weapons, proposes  that all nuclear powers conclude a treaty undertaking not to be  the first to use such weapons and supports the effort to  conclude a comprehensive test ban treaty through negotiations,  Li Peng said.    China does not engage in the arms race, nor does it  participate in any military bloc or seek a sphere of influence.  It supports the idea of conducting dialogues on matters of  security and cooperation in Asia and the Pacific and has made  contributions to that end.    Li Peng pointed out that no matter how the international  arena changes, China will not swerve from its position of  upholding the five principles of peaceful coexistence, nor will  it change its policy of developing friendly relations and  cooperation with other developing countries.    "Ours is a diversified world. It is essential for countries  to recognize the differences in their social systems,  ideologies, cultures, traditions, national characteristics and  religious beliefs, to respect each other, cooperate with each  other for their mutual benefit and develop state-to-state  relations on the basis of the universally recognized norms.    On human rights issue, Li said China values human rights and  is willing to discuss the matter with other members of the  international community on the basis of mutual equality.  However, it will never allow anyone to interfere in its  internal affairs under any pretext. The Chinese Government  supports the latest resolution adopted by the United Nations  Commission on Human Rights denouncing certain countries for  putting pressure on the developing countries in this regard.    He said the Chinese people will continue to work together  with all other peoples around the world to establish a new  international political order and a new international economic  order that are just and equitable, to maintain world peace and  to promote common development.</p>

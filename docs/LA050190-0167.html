			<p><P> May 1, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> U.S. MAY PLACE IRAQ BACK ON LIST OF TERRORIST NATIONS  </P> <P> The Bush Administration will consider returning Iraq to its list of countries  that sponsor international terrorism, Secretary of State James A. Baker III  told Congress today.  </P> <P> Baker said Iraq's efforts to develop a nuclear program are "particularly  disturbing."  </P> <P> Iraq was removed from the list in 1984.  </P> <P> "I think we have to take a look at this issue, and we will be taking a look at  this issue," Baker told a Senate appropriations subcommittee a day after the  State Department's annual report to Congress on terrorism.  </P> <P> That report cited six nations for sponsoring international terrorism, including  Syria and Iran, which won praise from President Bush on Monday for their help  in the release of American hostage Frank H. Reed in Lebanon.  </P> <P> Countries on the list are denied advanced American technology and U.S. support  for various international bank loans. In addition to Syria and Iran, the list  includes Libya, Cuba, North Korea and South Yemen.  </P> <P> Sen. Bob Kasten (R-Wis.) told Baker that whatever the Administration's  decision, he will promote legislation in Congress to put Iraq on the terrorism  list.  </P></p>

Gervin also told the officer he "did not  want to commit suicide," the police report stated.  </P> <P> Spur Coach Larry Brown said he had tried to get Gervin out of retirement a  month ago.  </P> <P> "They tell me you have got to hit rock bottom before they can make you better.  Maybe this is what it's going to take for Ice to get straight," Brown said.  </P></p>

			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / The GATT Agreement: Confusion over Section 301 powers on services The extent of curbs placed by the new world trade accord on unilateral action by the US was the subject of conflicting statements yesterday. In particular, confusion arose over whether US Section 301 retaliatory powers could be used against financial and audio-visual services specifically exempted from fair trade obligations under the Uruguay Round services accord. US officials said the administration could continue to take unilateral reprisals against unfair trading practices in services exempted from the general services agreement obligation to give equal market access to all trading partners, known as Most Favoured Nation treatment. On Tuesday, at the end of their final negotiating marathon, Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, and Sir Leon Brittan, European Union trade commissioner, said that after failing to settle disputes on audiovisual and financial services, both sides would be taking MFN exemptions in these sectors. The EU later argued that because these services are covered by the Uruguay Round general services agreement, the US would in future be barred from taking unilateral action. Since MFN exemptions are contained in country schedules (part of the Uruguay Round services accord), these were effectively sheltered from Section 301 attack. Gatt officials share this interpretation. 'The US can't challenge MFN exemptions under Section 301,' said one. 'The country schedules are an integral part of the Uruguay Round deal.' 'If the EU tables an exemption and the US accepts that, I don't see the US has a leg to stand on,' said another. The EU has taken several exemptions from MFN treatment in the audio-visual sector, most importantly for its system of broadcasting quotas reserving the majority of TV programming for European productions. The US, on reflection, decided there was no need for it to do so, officials said. Mr Kantor said on Tuesday the US would also be taking exemptions for audio-visual services, but in the end decided not to do so, officials stated. US officials say an MFN exemption simply removes the obligation of countries to conform to non-discrimination rules, but does not protect it from challenge that its practices are unfair. 'An MFN exemption doesn't mean a country can do what it likes,' a US negotiator declared. 'There's nothing in the services agreement that bars us from using Section 301.' That already requires the administration to seek recourse under multilateral dispute procedures where available. The new streamlined Uruguay Round disputes settlement procedure will cover services (and intellectual property) for the first time, obliging the US to route more disputes through multilateral procedures. But 'if a country has an MFN exemption we wouldn't have recourse under the services agreement', so unilateral action would be possible, the US official added. Further multilateral talks on maritime services will be held along with continuing ones on financial services, as agreed by Mr Kantor and Sir Leon on Tuesday, trade officials said. The shipping talks, like those planned for basic telecommunications, are set to end in 1996.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Elections Failed a Third Time in </F> Kaisiadorys"]    [Text] Of the 38,900 voters in the Kaisiadorys electoral  district only 1,878 or 4.8 percent came to vote a third time for  the sole candidate running for Seimas, A. Visockas, chairman of  the Socialist Party. The candidate received 1,312 votes, or 70  percent of those participating. The inhabitants of Pravieniskiai  were the most active: of 300 voters, 227 gave their votes to A.  Visockas. Voting took place in all precincts, although some  electoral commission members refused to take part in the  elections, and no substantial violations of the electoral law  were found.    A. Zilinskas, secretary of the Main Electoral Commission,  reported these facts as well as the preliminary voting results  to reporters yesterday. The commission plans to receive all the  official election documents today. They will then be verified.  Correspondence ballots from abroad have also not yet been  received (about 18 are expected). But the conclusion is already  clear: a Seimas member has not been elected for the Kaisiadorys  electoral district -- the election simply did not take place.  This "pleasure" cost about 50 thousand litas.    The fourth round of elections in Kaisiadorys should be held  in half a year, in November.</p>

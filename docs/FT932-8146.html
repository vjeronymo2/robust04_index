			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Sticking to the border - A look at the European expansion of Swiss retailer Migros Crossing borders has become second nature for many businesses, but not for retailers. Companies that have exported a successful retailing formula are few, while the list of failures, including the UK's Marks &amp; Spencer in Canada and France's Printemps in Japan, is depressingly long. Now, a new generation of retailers is trying again. Last December, Tesco of the UK bought the 92-store Catteau chain of supermarkets in northern France. Two months later, Kingfisher, the UK retailing group, acquired Darty, France's largest electrical retailer. Ahold of the Netherlands, Aldi and Tengelmann of Germany, and Promodes and Carrefour of France are among those which have built up the proportion of their sales in other European markets to more than 30 per cent. The latest to join this trend is Migros, one of Europe's most powerful retailers, but up to now active only in Switzerland. A federation of 12 co-operative societies, the company is building supermarkets in France and Germany and is committed to taking a leading position in the Austrian grocery market. Its progress will be watched closely by other European retailers, after its large success in Switzerland, where it has 23 per cent of the food market. It buys more than 20 per cent of Switzerland's annual agricultural production and, in line with its founder Gottlieb Duttweiler's policy of reducing prices by cutting out the middleman, it manufactures about a third of what it sells in its own factories. Moreover, its method of expansion may prove a model. Having carefully studied the failures of others, Migros believes the key to success, in food retailing at least, is to stick at first to the regions around one's home base. It also decided not to open its own stores in Austria, but rather to form joint ventures with existing local retailers. Eugen Hunziker, president of the Migros federation, acknowledges the biggest mistake most retailers have made in cross-border ventures has been underestimating the differences from their home market. Successful retailing involves delivering the right goods and services to the local customer. But differing tastes, cultures and climate mean the demands of customers vary considerably in different parts of Europe. Moreover, different legislation in areas, such as opening hours, planning restrictions, VAT and minimum wages, can make operating conditions very different in foreign markets. Even within the US where there are no significant linguistic or cultural borders, national retailers, such as Safeway and A&amp;P, have been unable to keep pace with regional specialists, argues Hunziker. The challenge, he says, is defining which regions belong together. Switzerland, for example, has three cultures clearly separated from one another. Yet Migros succeeds in all, by carefully targeting its products and offering them at aggressive prices. Migros management knows its supermarkets are appreciated beyond Switzerland's borders. German, Italian, French and Austrian consumers regularly cross the border to shop in its stores. Besides awareness of the potential pitfalls, Migros' cumbersome democratic decision-making process within the co-operatives had previously acted as a brake on cross border expansion. But the pressure has now become irresistible. The group has limited potential for growth at home and needs more outlets for its manufactured products, including confectionery, pasta and hygiene products, if it is to remain competitive. With the creation of a single market in the European Community it looked as if expansion into neighbouring countries could be approached gradually and painlessly. Migros first dipped its toe in the water last year, launching two supermarket projects in the French suburbs of Geneva and another in a German suburb of Basle. Then in December a majority of Swiss voted against joining the European Economic Area (EEA), an expanded free-trade zone with the EC. That meant that exporting from Switzerland would continue to be difficult and the group would need a secure base somewhere within the EEA. The obvious solution was to go to Austria. Austria will be a member of the EEA as well as having easy trade relations with Switzerland through the European Free Trade Association. In March, Migros made a series of deals that would give it access to about a quarter of the Austrian grocery market at a cost estimated by outside analysts at more than SFr200m (Pounds 88.4m). It acquired the chain of 112 Familia supermarkets based mainly in the western Austrian province of Vorarlberg from the Zumtobel group. It then formed two joint ventures with Konsum, Austria's largest supermarket chain. One venture, in which Migros will have a 75 per cent controlling interest, will manage the Familia supermarkets and Konsum supermarkets in Vorarlberg. It will have estimated sales of SFr200m and employ around 1,500 people. The other, in which Migros has only a 25 per cent stake, brings together 78 Konsum supermarkets throughout Austria and the Familia shops outside of Vorarlberg. It would have annual sales of Sch12bn (Pounds 690m) and employ around 4,000 people. Even expanding reasonably close to home, though, can lead to complications. News of the joint ventures provoked an outcry from Austrian trade unions, which claimed Migros' policy of manufacturing so much of its own goods would mean the loss of thousands of jobs in Austrian manufacturing. Hunziker dismisses the idea that Migros is going to divert Konsum and Familia's existing supply and distribution networks to its Swiss sources, although it is analysing the Austrian stores in detail to see which of its own products it can sell, and how it can best take advantage of its international procurement potential. 'We didn't go into Austria on our own, but looked for co-operation. We can't transfer Migros philosophy and policy wholesale. The Austrians will tell us what we can and cannot do,' he says. With that type of attitude, Migros may stand a better chance than some of its precursors of making a success of its cross-border ventures.</p>

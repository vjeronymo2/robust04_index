			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Marian Krzaklewski, chairman of the </F> Solidarity Trade Union, by correspondent Barbara  Madajczyk-Krasowska; place and date not given]    [Text] [Madajczyk-Krasowska] The prime minister promised  you that the government would withdraw its support for the  proposed "popiwek" [enterprise tax on above-normative pay] act,  but the very next day deputies representing the prime minister's  party submitted a new popiwek bill to the Sejm's attention. They  explained this move by saying that they did not consult with the  prime minister on their decision because he left for Germany  before they had a chance to talk with him. Do you feel cheated?    [Krzaklewski] The prime minister has made it clear to the  whole of society, and not just us, that his declarations cannot  be treated seriously. I do not know whether this scenario was  actually preplanned--that is, whether the prime minister  intended to announce the withdrawal of his support for the  popiwek act in public one day, and to have his deputies submit a  government bill for a new popiwek act the next, but, whether or  not it was, this sort of strategy is dishonest and it  compromises the government. It could also suggest that the prime  minister has lost control of his own party and, by the same  token, has lost his credibility with us. In any case, the point  is not only that the National Commission was cheated, inasmuch  as its members had left Gdansk with very little hope that a  dialogue with the government was still possible. The National  Commission regarded the prime minister's declaration with much  reserve anyway, and it decided not to suspend the protest action  while awaiting the implementation of the said declaration.  Moreover, we never received a positive reply to any of our  remaining stipulations.    [Madajczyk-Krasowska] Which ones?    [Krzaklewski] The ones concerning energy prices, taxation,  citizens' enfranchisement, and a 40-hour workweek. In other  words, stipulations mainly concerned with ensuring an increase  in families' real incomes. It is inconceivable that we should  have a situation in which the 1994 gross national product is on  the increase, but the working people's family incomes keep  falling. The government rejected our recommendations that energy  price increases be reduced to the level of inflation. In a  clever move, it spread the increases over three successive  stages, which is why people have not felt their full effects  yet, but, because of that operation, the increases will be  higher than originally announced. Similarly, families have not  yet felt the impact of the changed taxation bands. For example,  people who earn a comparatively large amount will soon enter the  second taxation band. If, as a result of the "married couple"  assessment of tax liability, which includes their spouses, it  turns out that their income tax does not exceed the 33-percent  threshold, they will still not get back the advance  payment--reduced by the inflation rate--until the second quarter  of the following year. Because of this kind of regulation, we  demand the chance to assess family incomes on a current basis,  determining from such assessment which families should be  automatically receiving family income supplement. Social unrest  is increasing, and, if it does not explode today, it is bound to  in August or September, with greatly magnified force.    [Madajczyk-Krasowska] But is your stipulation to enfranchise  society not belated and unrealistic, in any case? After all,  workforces of enterprises under privatization receive their  allocated shares according to the terms and provisions of the  "Enterprises Pact." As a result of this form of privatization,  many employees become millionaires, not to say billionaires.    [Krzaklewski] Like the night guard at Bank Slaski. The  enfranchisement demand is not belated and is still perfectly  relevant today. People feel the injustice of the uneven  opportunities more and more acutely. Those citizens who have the  luck to be working in enterprises that are being  privatized--even if the privatization is of a pathological  nature--have a chance of becoming richer than they were before.  Others, who have been contributing to the creation of the  state's assets, have no such chance at all.    [Madajczyk-Krasowska] Those who have received their shares  will not give them back now.    [Krzaklewski] Their shares should be treated as prepayment  on  account of the universal privatization scheme. If they exceed a  certain set limit, they will get no more shares in the future.  We want to see 50 percent of the inventoried State Treasury  assets distributed among all citizens in the form of  privatization bonds. After two or three years, the owners will  be able to exchange the bonds for shares in banks and companies  or, for example, use them to purchase homes within company  housing schemes. Certain preferential terms should be reserved  for employees of the privatized enterprises because they had  taken an active part in the creation of their assets.    [Madajczyk-Krasowska] But such decisions require fundamental  changes in the entire system.    [Krzaklewski] Indeed, the system does need to be changed.    [Madajczyk-Krasowska] If Solidarity-based governments failed  to introduce significant changes in the system, how do you  expect the present postcommunist parties to do it?    [Krzaklewski] I most emphatically deny that they were truly  Solidarity-based governments. They were governments composed of  people who had once belonged as members to the Solidarity trade  union, were experts attached to it, or were otherwise associated  with it on political grounds. These people created their own  political parties, with specific programs and ideologies. But  they should not be associated with a trade union. None of these  parties has ever realized the Solidarity program. It is high  time to put an end to the formulation "Solidarity governments."  Let me remind you that, if you do not count the resolution in  support of the president in the election, Solidarity has never  officially resolved to promote or sponsor the authorities in  power after 1989.    [Madajczyk-Krasowska] What about the "protective umbrella"  extended over the first Solidarity-based government?    [Krzaklewski] That was an umbrella over the whole of Poland.  After all, as early as 1990, there were several dozen strike  actions, and, in the following year, their number grew to  several hundred. Through the end of 1993, we had more than 1,000  strike actions. Would you still maintain that we were extending  a protective umbrella over the government? Remember that we  started coming out in protest much earlier than the  postcommunist trade unions.    [Madajczyk-Krasowska] Rumors circulating among certain  Solidarity activists have it that the latest demonstration and  the wave of recent strikes were inspired by President Lech  Walesa.    [Krzaklewski] This is arrant nonsense! The last time I had  any direct contact with the president was before the Zielona  Gora congress.    [Madajczyk-Krasowska] But, during the Warsaw demonstration,  the Solidarity leadership did its best to ensure that the  marchers did not go to the Belweder.    [Krzaklewski] We did not want to dilute our action by  introducing a whole variety of issues and slogans. We wanted to  show that our goal was to secure increases in families' incomes.  In the past few days, the president interpreted our protest  correctly. His veto of the popiwek act was not exclusively a  gesture in the direction of private companies. It came as a  result of pressure exerted by our union, and that is why we  expressed our thanks to the president.    [Madajczyk-Krasowska] Meanwhile, the Nonparty Bloc in  Support  of Reforms [BBWR], which is the president's organization, has  been boasting that it was the first to support your strike  actions.    [Krzaklewski] The first organization that offered us its  support was the center-right parties' secretariat. However, we  would like to be effectively supported by politically strong  parties--and these are lacking at the political center and on  the right. Consequently, we are waiting for a strong party,  whose program and ideology will not be at odds with Solidarity.  I am afraid that we might have a long wait ahead of us.    [Madajczyk-Krasowska] It so happened that Professor  Zbigniew Religa, BBWR chief, offered to represent you  politically before your meeting with the president. What are you  going to answer if, say, the president promises to supports your  demands but, in return, stipulates that you support him in the  presidential election?    [Krzaklewski] We cannot even consider such an eventuality,  and we will not enter into any political compacts with  anyone--not even the president--because we are not a political  party. All we can do is negotiate a certain contract on the  basis of which the president would support our demands. On the  other hand, making promises of support for the president on  behalf of all of our members would be dishonest of us. People  will support him but only when he has fulfilled their  expectations. We would be very glad to see the president achieve  successes because people would then live a better life.  Recently, we learned that, apart from the right to veto  parliamentary bills, the president has a rather limited range of  powers because a peculiar hegemony of two parties has arisen in  parliament, and this enables them to approve virtually any bills  they want.    [Madajczyk-Krasowska] It was members of the public who chose  them.    [Krzaklewski] But the same number of people voted for the  parties and political groups that are outside parliament now.  Does Mr. Kowalski, who voted for the groups that did not pass  the parliamentary threshold, have different constitutional  rights from Mr. Nowak, who voted for the parties that passed the  5-percent threshold?    [Madajczyk-Krasowska] In that case, why did the leaders of  the former groups, including also Solidarity, not give Kowalski  a chance by creating a joint coalition? After all, the National  Trade Union Accord [OPZZ] did enter a coalition with the  Democratic Left Alliance [SLD].    [Krzaklewski] Before the election, we campaigned for  creating  a block of combined votes in favor of the Solidarity electoral  list, but each of the possible parties was convinced that it  would obtain the required 5 percent of votes on its own. It is  also worth remembering that some parties were hostile to us. To  tell the truth, the only offer of support came from the  president.    [Madajczyk-Krasowska] But you rejected it.    [Krzaklewski] That was in order to demonstrate that  Solidarity as a union will not enter into any political compacts  with any party or parties. If we did, it would be a decision of  grave consequences for a union as pluralistic as ours. On the  other hand, the BBWR electorate is in the main associated with  the liberal and neoliberal orientations as regards the economy.    [Madajczyk-Krasowska] What political and economic system do  you want?    [Krzaklewski] We want a system that will combine market  economy with cooperation and that will constitutionally  guarantee a dialogue between social partners, a dialogue  conducted according to the rules of social solidarity. You could  provisionally call it a market-and-social-solidarity system.    [Madajczyk-Krasowska] Is that not a utopian vision? After  all, this world is marked by conflict between groups of opposing  interests.    [Krzaklewski] They come into conflict and thus drag the  world  into a crisis. Nowadays everybody is asking what kind of system  we should have.    [Madajczyk-Krasowska] People have always asked this  question.  We know that only a democratic system based on political parties  can withstand major crises.    [Krzaklewski] Are we in Poland supposed to copy the mistakes  made by those who refuse to put their efforts into creating a  more stable political system, in which the principle of social  solidarity would be the rule?    [Madajczyk-Krasowska] Do you suggest a third way?    [Krzaklewski] Yes. World confederations of trade unions are  of a similar opinion, too. Such a program was presented by  Solidarity at the latest World Labor Organization congress.    [Madajczyk-Krasowska] Who is supposed to realize it?    [Krzaklewski] It must be written into the constitution of  the  Third Republic.    [Madajczyk-Krasowska] Do you sometimes dream of a return of  Solidarity as it was in 1980?    [Krzaklewski] There will never be another Solidarity like  that because the situation is very different now. At that time,  we were fighting to regain our national independence and to  return to fundamental moral values. We were involved in the  creation of a democratic system that would not be dominated  solely by the free market and monetarism but would include  ethical values.    [Madajczyk-Krasowska] Do you know even one country where  moral values are placed at the top of the agenda?    [Krzaklewski] In other words, you mean paradise. Even if we  cannot build such a paradisiacal country in this world, that is  no reason to give up our hopes and ambitions. We must strive to  improve the system, and we must protect people from being  marginalized because otherwise they will cease believing in just  and fair political and economic action and become irresponsible.  After all, neofascist groups are already beginning to gain  momentum in both the West and the East.    Poland and other postcommunist countries are now facing the  risk of building a capitalist system on the basis of dishonestly  accumulated capital. A significant proportion of present  businessmen are people who amassed their wealth only because  they were, for example, communist functionaries or financial  criminals who escaped being caught and brought to justice after  1989. If such negative tendencies prevail in the future, we will  move in the direction of the system of capital oligarchy--that  is, the stage South American countries had attained in the  1950's and 1960's. Seventy percent of national assets will be in  the hands of 10,000 or so citizens. We are at this moment at the  crossroads of a struggle for our system.    [Madajczyk-Krasowska] How do you propose to introduce a  better system? With the help of strikes, demonstrations, or  perhaps a revolution?    [Krzaklewski] We want to change the law and make a clean  break with the legislative system obtaining in the Polish  People's Republic [PPR] as well as the consequences of that  system; we also want to enfranchise all citizens. We believe  that there is a need for a decisive break with the previous  system by means of such moves as, among other things, the  introduction of a vetting law and a decommunization law, which  would condemn past structures instead of people.    [Madajczyk-Krasowska] You blame all mistakes on  Solidarity-derived parties, but, at the same time, you form very  extensive coalitions with them for the purpose of local  self-government elections. Is your anticommunist crusade  supposed to justify even those coalitions you form with the  parties that previously tried to restrict your rights?    [Krzaklewski] We do not form coalitions but, at the most,  enter into contracts in support of individual candidates. On the  whole, Solidarity Trade Union does not take part in its own  right in local self-government elections.    [Madajczyk-Krasowska] When are you going to meet with the  president?    [Krzaklewski] The date of our meeting depends on the  president's choice. We regret that the president signed the  Budget Act before meeting with us; many of our stipulations  could be realized through complementary budget-related  parliamentary acts and regulations. We wanted to explain to the  president that it is not at all necessary to introduce  fundamental changes in the budget in order to meet our demands.    [Madajczyk-Krasowska] Do you have an alliance with the  president?    [Krzaklewski] We do not. We have formal relations with him.    [Madajczyk-Krasowska] Will you allow yourselves to be  exploited by the president?    [Krzaklewski] You cannot view our meeting with the president  in terms of one side losing and one side gaining in the  exchange. It is the country that is supposed to gain. That was  what we were talking about during our meetings with the  president last year.    [Madajczyk-Krasowska] What if the president were to dissolve  parliament in fulfillment of his threats? Would you support him  then?    [Krzaklewski] The president cannot dissolve parliament just  like that, on his whim.    [Madajczyk-Krasowska] What if he were to resort to the use  of  power?    [Krzaklewski] That would be tantamount to fascism! We will  not lend support to such moves even in relation to a parliament  led by communists. The democratic system must be respected even  if it has given birth to an "ugly duckling." After all, we have  fought for that system--and we are still fighting for it.</p>

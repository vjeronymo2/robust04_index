			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / FT Guide To The Week Monday 7 Clinton presents his budget The Clinton administration is due to send its 1995 budget to Congress. President Bill Clinton (left), intent on reducing the federal deficit below Dollars 180bn in the coming fiscal year, has said that nine of his 14 cabinet-level agencies will have to get by on less. The greatest interest lies in which programmes get cut and which spared. The European Parliament holds a plenary session in Strasbourg (to Feb 11). MEPs are expected to debate the much-delayed Schengen agreement on open borders, progress on the European Union enlargement negotiations, and the Herman report on a possible European constitution. EU foreign ministers meet in Brussels. Greece chairs the first EU foreign ministers' meeting of its six-month presidency (to Feb 8). Items include former Yugoslavia; efforts to improve trade relations with Russia, Ukraine and the Baltic states; new rules on the use of trade weapons; and relations with troubled Algeria. CFA franc France's president Francois Mitterrand and prime minister Edouard Balladur are to meet the leaders of the 13 west and central African countries forced to devalue their common CFA franc by 50 per cent in January. It was the first change in parity for the communaute financiere africaine franc since 1948. Discussions take place in in Yamoussoukro, Ivory Coast, after the funeral of the West African country's late president, Felix Houphouet-Boigny. Thorp in court Greenpeace, the environment pressure group, and Lancashire County Council make their final attempt to challenge the UK government's decision to grant a licence to the Thorp nuclear reprocessing plant at Sellafield, Cumbria, north-west England. The verdict of the judicial review in the High Court in London will be final. Thorp's critics are worried about radioactive emissions. The government announced its decision to give the go-ahead to the Pounds 2.8bn plant before Christmas. The licence came into effect on January 17. Maxwell musical injunction UK attorney-general, Sir Nicholas Lyell, is to apply for an injunction to stop the curtain rising on Maxwell: The Musical, a West End show chronicling the life and times of the late Robert Maxwell. Fears that the show might prejudice the criminal trial of the late publisher's sons, Kevin and Ian, have prompted the action. Holidays Taiwan (markets closed). Tuesday 8 US health reform plan The US Congressional Budget Office is due to deliver its verdict on the financial soundness of the Clinton administration's proposed reforms of the health care system. The House Ways and Means Committee also holds its first hearing on the plan and will discuss the budget office cost analysis. US-Japanese trade The American Chamber of Commerce in Japan is to send a delegation to Washington to call for the opening of Japanese markets ahead of Friday's summit between Japanese prime minister Morihiro Hosokawa and US president Bill Clinton. UK inflation The Bank of England's quarterly inflation report will be examined for indications of the authorities' attitude towards base rate cuts. The inflation picture has improved since the last report in November, so the tone is expected to be upbeat. However, international interest rate developments have reduced the likelihood of a UK rate cut. EU enlargement European Union foreign ministers continue their meeting in Brussels. The main topic on the agenda will be the state of the enlargement negotiations with Norway, Sweden, Finland and Austria. Officials are trying to meet the March 1 deadline for completing the talks. Works councils The European Commission is due to approve a plan which dilutes earlier proposals for mandatory elected works councils in about 1,500 pan-European companies. Employers have objected to any mention of minimum requirements for consultation. Trade union organisations, however, are unhappy at what they see as a U-turn by the Commission. Azerbaijan's president, Gaidar Aliyev, visits Turkey. The trip will demonstrate a warming in relations after disagreement over the proposed Azeri pipeline project and last year's ousting of pro-Turkish former president Abulfaz Elchibey. Armenia's president, Levon Ter Petrossian, makes the first official visit to the UK by a president of the Republic of Armenia. President Ter Petrossian will meet the Queen, prime minister John Major and foreign secretary Douglas Hurd (to Feb 10) . The aim of the visit is to strengthen political and economic ties between the two countries. Saleroom A doll, 64 cm high, is expected to sell at Sotheby's in London for between Pounds 150,000 and Pounds 200,000. The doll is unique, as Kammer and Reinhardt, its German manufacturers, apparently made just this one mould in 1909. The previous auction record for a 20th century doll is Pounds 90,200. Holidays Taiwan (markets closed). Wednesday 9 Japan's economic forecast The Japanese government is due to decide its economic forecast for the fiscal year 1994.

The Ministry of Finance is expected to announce the draft 1994 national budget by Thursday. Scott inquiry Sir Robin Butler, Cabinet Secretary and head of the UK Home Civil Service gives evidence to Scott inquiry into arms exports to Iraq. The judge will take evidence today and for the rest of the week from Sir Robin, who as cabinet secretary, is responsible for the conduct of civil servants. He is expected to be pressed for his views on ministerial accountability and the responsibility of officials to carry out orders which may go against government guidelines. UK Sunday shopping The shops bill, which liberalises trading laws in England and Wales, may be sabotaged by an alliance of Labour and Conservative MPs. Ministers fear that die-hard Tory supporters of the Keep Sunday Special campaign will back a Labour amendment guaranteeing double time to shop workers. The government fears other groups would seek similar statutory protection. City of London Winning People, a report commissioned by city institutions and the City and Inner London North Training and Enterprise Council, is due to be published. It concludes that unless there is a change in management practices, the City risks losing its position as Europe's premier financial centre. Desperately seeking Oscar Hollywood opens for Oscar business with the nominations for the 66th Academy Awards. Spielberg's Schindler's List is firm Best Film favourite, having won top honours at the run-up award sprees. If Spielberg himself misses out on Best Director - which would be Hollywood keeping to its anti-wonderboy custom - Jane Campion (The Piano) may change history by becoming a woman winner. Other bookie's favourites: The Piano's Holly Hunter for Best Actress and any of an army of Britons for Best Actor. Among them, David Thewlis (Naked) and double-threat performers Daniel Day-Lewis (The Age Of Innocence, In The Name Of The Father) and Anthony Hopkins (The Remains Of The Day, Shadowlands). Holidays South Korea, Taiwan (Chinese New Year's Eve). Thursday 10 Hosokawa starts his US trip Japanese prime minister Morihiro Hosokawa leaves for Washington to meet US president Bill Clinton (to Feb 12). Their session in the White House on Friday will be the climax of an intense week in US-Japan relations, centring on trade issues. The US expects Japan to make big concessions, agreeing to set numerical targets for the penetration of US goods and services into the Japanese market. Japan has shown little sign of budging. US economy The assumptions and projections underlying the Clinton administration's budget pronouncements on Monday are laid bare in the report of the president's Council of Economic Advisers. Elf privatisation Deadline for buying shares in the privatisation of the French oil group Elf Aquitaine. The price of FFr385 (Dollars 65) per share was set last week. Elf is the largest company to be sold so far in the programme to divest the state of 21 publicly owned concerns. Bosnia talks Peace talks between the three warring parties are due to resume in Geneva under United Nations-European Union mediation. The three sides appear to expect no halt to hostilities, so the meeting, if it takes place, is likely to focus more on confidence building-measures than the future borders of Bosnia's partition. Brittan in Turkey Sir Leon Brittan (left), the European Union commissioner for external economic affairs, arrives in Turkey for two days of talks. The discussions will cover Turkish-EU relations and progress towards a customs union, which is due for completion in 1995.

Since November, Cusani has declined to go to the witness stand.

Strike in Portugal Public sector unions have called their second 24-hour strike in less than three weeks to protest at the government's 1994 pay offer of 2.5 per cent, against forecast inflation of 6 per cent.

			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / Kinnock pours scorn on 'complacent' PM MR NEIL KINNOCK yesterday signalled a fresh readiness to hold Mr John Major personally responsible for the government's failures, claiming that his monument would be 'the longest recession since the 1930s'. In a speech that echoed Labour's 1964 slogan of '13 years of Tory misrule', the Labour leader claimed that the government had 'no new policies, no fresh ideas and no positive solutions'. His keynote address to Labour's annual local government conference in Blackpool was also squarely aimed at tarnishing Tory efforts to project a 'softer' image in the run-up to the election. In a series of scornful attacks, he repeatedly portrayed Mr Major as deluded, complacent and out of touch. Taking up a recent reference by the prime minister to people sleeping rough, he said Mr Major's withdrawal of benefits from people aged 16 to 18 when he was social security minister meant he himself was 'the architect of cardboard city'. The Tories sought to pre-empt the occasion by challenging Labour to use the conference to spell out its own local government plans. Mr Michael Heseltine, environment secretary, used his first setpiece press conference of the pre-election campaign to launch a broad attack which included assaults on the cost of Labour's plans and the behaviour of Labour councils. Mr Kinnock countered the attacks on Labour councils' records by claiming that authorities under his party's control had persistently topped the leagues for the provision of a wide range of public services. He turned to the government's economic record, arguing that the government had squandered Pounds 100bn in North Sea oil revenues and Pounds 34bn in privatisation proceeds. 'They have run through more taxes than any British government has ever taken from the British people in history,' he said. 'At the end of it all, they have higher unemployment, wider poverty, run-down services, closed industries, greater insecurity and homelessness.' As a result, the UK was enduring skill shortages alongside mass unemployment, a trade deficit in a slump and a collapse in investment in an oil-rich economy. Speaking confidently to some 800 delegates, Mr Kinnock concentrated his speech on the Tory record. He argued that 'investment must come before tax cuts', and said the Tories had promised a thriving enterprise economy but had delivered only a weakened economy deep in recession. 'They promised a classless society, a society at ease with itself, but they have made a society that is scarred by poverty, by disadvantage and by insecurity. They have had their chance.'</p>

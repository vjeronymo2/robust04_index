			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / Rolls decline at independent schools PUPIL NUMBERS at independent schools have fallen for the first time in nine years, with boarding schools bearing the brunt of the decline, according to figures released yesterday by the Independent Schools Information Service. The survey shows that fees have risen an average 12 per cent from last year  - nearly three times the rate of inflation  - taking average boarding fees to Pounds 8,625 a year and day fees to Pounds 3,774. Fees at Headmasters' Conference schools, the independent sector's elite, average Pounds 9,522 a year for boarders and Pounds 4,014 for day pupils. The number of private-school pupils fell only 0.2 per cent. In January 475,288 pupils were attending 1,364 schools affiliated to the information service. The number of boarding pupils is sharply down  - by 4 per cent on the year, making a total fall of nearly 11 per cent in three years. Girls' schools and prep schools are hardest hit. The number of boarders at the 243 schools affiliated to the Girls' Schools Association fell 4.9 per cent, and there was a 6.4 per cent fall at the 523 members of the Association of Preparatory Schools. Mr David Woodhead, director of the information service, said the survey showed the resilience of independent schools in the trough of recession. According to the survey almost a quarter of pupils receive help with fees  - a 6.4 per cent rise on last year  - with most of the help coming from schools themselves. Mr John Patten, education secretary, yesterday launched a drive to recruit 75,000 school governors amid concern about the unwillingness of professional people to take on the increasingly onerous duty of overseeing and managing schools. The current demand for governors is caused by the ending later this year of the four-year terms of governors appointed after the 1988 Education Reform Act. Launching a nationwide 'Schools Need Governors' campaign in London, Mr Patten urged the business and education communities to make common cause in the running of schools.

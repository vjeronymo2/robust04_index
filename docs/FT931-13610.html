			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / International Company News: Texaco declines to Dollars 313m after charges SPECIAL charges resulted in fourth-quarter 1992 net profit at Texaco, the US energy group, declining to Dollars 313m, or Dollars 1.11 a share, from Dollars 324m, or Dollars 1.15, in the corresponding period of 1991. Revenues for the quarter were down marginally at Dollars 9.7bn, against Dollars 9.75bn. For the whole of 1992 Texaco's net profit slumped 45 per cent to Dollars 712m or Dollars 2.37 per share. However, this figure included a Dollars 300m charge for changes in accounting principles. Revenues for 1992 were Dollars 37.7bn, down from Dollars 38.3bn in 1991. Mr James Kinnear, outgoing Texaco chief executive, said that beyond special charges, the decline in 1992 profits occurred primarily from soft market conditions for refined products, crude oil market conditions and a generally difficult business environment. But he added that Texaco realised cash savings of about Dollars 500m in 1992 from reductions in operating and overhead expenses. Texaco said its fourth-quarter operating income before taking the charges was Dollars 416m, up from Dollars 295m in the last quarter of 1991. Despite tax benefits of Dollars 40m, the fourth-quarter net profit was depressed by special charges, including a special write-off of Dollars 34m caused by property damage from a fire at Los Angeles refinery and Hurricane Andrew. In addition, there were Dollars 58m of payments for staff severance and Dollars 64m for charges associated with asset-writedowns and reserves for environmental clean-up matters. On Wall Street, Texaco's share price declined Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 58 at the close.</p>

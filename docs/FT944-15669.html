			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / Survey of International Telecommunications (22): The Jason Project Advanced communications are linking students and scientists, half a world away, in less than half a second, in the Jason project, a pioneering concept in interactive 'distance learning.' Pictured above is the EDS information management centre at Plano, Texas, where satellite signals are monitored. Next February, half a million students and school-children will be able to watch scientists in a live exploration of the crater of Kilauea, one of the world's most active volcanoes, on the island of Hawaii. This year, in other Jason ventures, children at UK schools were able to follow 'live' exploration of the rain forests, reefs and caves of Belize in Central America.</p>

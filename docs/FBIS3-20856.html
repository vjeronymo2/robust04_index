			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Michal Kudernatsch: "Our Satisfaction Is Growing </F> Only Slowly"]    [Text] According to older sociological investigations,  significant fears regarding the consequences of the economic  reform that have been initiated prevailed in this country as of  1990. General feelings of insecurity were on the rise until June  1991, when they culminated--a mere 11 percent of the population  at that time considered its economic situation to be  advantageous. Since that time, the satisfaction factor among the  people is showing a rising trend. The most recent November  investigations conducted by the Sociological Institute of the  Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic and by the Center for  Empirical Research (STEM) on "economic expectations and  attitudes," contains proof of this: Their situation is  characterized as being favorable today by every fourth household  and virtually 73 percent of the population believes that the  economic and political changes will provide subsequent  generations with a better future than that which the communist  regime could provide them. That is not altered in the least even  by the finding that one-half of our fellow citizens continues to  designate its standard of living as being lower than it was  prior to November 1989.    The creation of a democratic framework is the fundamental  goal and, at the same time, represents the means of the reform.  That postulate is also accepted by the majority of the  people--71 percent of the citizens of the Czech Republic  thought, in November, that society was developing in the proper  direction and 63 percent even agree with the contention that the  establishment of the foundations for democracy has already  succeeded. Nevertheless, in this country the inclination toward  a totalitarian method of thinking continues to survive. More  than half of the population (53 percent) continues to agree with  the statement that "it would be better for our country if,  instead of discussions on various methods for solving the  current situation, there were a firm hand and someone to clearly  say what should be done."    We even find a similar "discrepancy" between the continuing  high support for the government, which espouses the ideas of  economic liberalism, and the actual orientation of the majority  of society, which is increasingly paternalistic. Whereas in June  1992 48 percent showed preference for the social market model,  in which the state exerts a substantial influence over the  economy, today that number has already risen to 59 percent. In  contrast, ideas of a free market, in which the state is involved  only to a minimum extent, is espoused today by only one-third of  society (36 percent), which is 11 percent less than was the case  last year in June.    Despite an overall high standard of living, significant  social and economic differences are a characteristic feature of  the market economy. At first glance, even here it seems that our  society is prepared for this situation. The majority of people  agree with the claim that it is correct for "truly capable  people to have lots of money, even millions" (75 percent) and  that "differences in salaries should be even increased" (66  percent). At the same time, however, eight out of 10 people  think that, in our country, "people grow rich primarily through  dishonest methods." At the general sociological level, it can,  therefore, be stated that in our society certain prejudices and  embitterments against rich people continue to be strongly  rooted. Incidentally, that conclusion is confirmed even by yet  another finding of the investigation: a strong inclination  within society toward paternalism.    An almost banal answer exists to the question why Czech  society frequently adopts paradoxic and confusing attitudes  toward economic issues: The reason lies in the gradual profiling  of disparate social strata, which can be demonstrated, in a  simplified manner, by noting the difference between latent  paternalism and liberalism. (These attitudes are designated as  being latent because not a single one of them is openly  proclaimed, but is, rather, the result of the analysis of  responses to substantive questions.) We briefly define  paternalism as over-reliance on the role of the state, even in  areas of social and economic life which are primarily the  responsibility of the individual. In the investigation,  paternalism was therefore characterized by positive responses to  questions such as: Should the state officially set prices more  vigorously, should it assure everyone who wants to work a job,  or whether the state should guarantee people a place to live? By  contrast, the liberal orientation stresses the role of the  individual in all spheres of life and, in the investigation, is  characterized, for example, by the agreement with the contention  that "everyone is primarily to blame for their own poverty."    Data obtained in this manner indicate that, in our country,  some 59 percent of the population are inclined toward latent  paternalism, whereas 41 percent are inclined toward latent  liberalism. And if we compare the data with the previously made  statement--that six out of 10 people prefer the so-called social  version of the market economy--then we find that virtually 80  percent of those who favor the social market economy actually  visualize this concept as being the directive functioning of the  state--much as we know it from the past.    Not even the question as to the extent to which the  paradoxic  views of people and their inclination toward latent paternalism  or liberalism are determined by their political orientations is  without interest. The respondents in the investigation,  therefore, were tasked to list their political orientation. The  results indicate that a large portion of the people tend to  identify with the political center. However, that group is not  characterized by any kind of more compact orientation and their  views are somewhat unclear and frequently confused. (And that is  not to even say anything about the fact that 33 percent of the  people with paternalistic views consider themselves to be  rightist in their orientation.)    A significant finding which has been statistically confirmed  is also the fact that as "paternalists" as well as "liberalists"  these people have their own socioeconomic hinterland, so to  speak. Of course, there can be no talk of a unilateral "class"  determinism, but, nevertheless, a certain connection between the  attitude and the social anchoring of an individual is  discernible from the investigation. The entrepreneurial and  managerial layer, for example, is characterized by its liberal  attitude, whereas the cooperative sector is paternalistic. Much  the same is true of property: The more property a person owns,  the greater the inclination toward liberalism. However, in  addition to economic aspects, it is also possible to find  additional statistically significant factors here which tend to  influence the formation of views. In the liberally oriented  group, younger people and people in their middle years up to 45  tend to predominate. Also, education is important: Virtually 74  percent of the respondents with a basic education are  paternalistic in their orientation, whereas 57 percent of people  with advanced school education are liberal in their orientation.    Despite the fact that attitudes toward the reform are  reflected in the social structure of society, it would be  misleading to claim that this involves rigidly separated blocks.  In other words: The investigation indicated that the differences  are not so great as to enable us to say that the conflict  between paternalism and liberalism is a dispute between the poor  and the rich and that it thus seriously threatens the stability  of the Czech Republic.</p>

			<p><P> June 6, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SUDDEN CELEBRITY PUZZLES FREEWAY ORDEAL SURVIVOR  </P> <P> In the two weeks since the tale of his gritty four-day vigil along a freeway  median drew national attention, hit-and-run survivor Juan Francisco Camacho  remains bewildered over the outpouring of public sympathy in cards, letters,  checks and offers of employment, from Alaska to North Carolina.  </P> <P> The wall above his hospital bed -- where the 20-year-old Mexican migrant worker  will remain in traction for months to come -- is filled with notes and  hand-drawn pictures from well-wishers, including a letter from former President  Reagan.  </P> <P> Each day, nurses bring new stacks of mail to add to the more than 100 letters  and packages he has received -- including collective notes from preschool  classes in Arizona and Northern California, as well as an offer from a local  man to fly Camacho's mother to San Diego from his hometown in southern Mexico.  </P> <P> Scripps Memorial Hospital in La Jolla has even begun a trust fund in Camacho's  name to handle the many checks and money orders still pouring in.  </P> <P> But Camacho, a shy man who speaks no English but still finds a way to flirt  with the nurses on his floor, has grown weary of the constant press intrusion.  Last week, as a photographer from a Florida-based tabloid positioned Camacho's  arms and head, the usually easygoing man finally placed his hands over his face  as if to say, "The photo session is over," nurses said.  </P> <P> Now, a "No Visitors" sign hangs on the door of his room. Lack of privacy is one  of the prices Camacho has paid for his new-found and unsolicited fame.  </P> <P> "For a while, he was getting bothered all the time by reporters and television  cameras, wanting pictures of his wounds and all the emotional insights of what  he went through," said Adelaida Bernas, a nurse who supervises Camacho's care.  </P> <P> "He's embarrassed the way they're exposing his medical problems. He doesn't  speak English, so the only way he can deal with it is cover his face with his  hands or a newspaper."  </P> <P> Said another nurse: "A lot of reporters are like little gnats, they're so  pushy. But he wasn't going to be intimidated -- especially by a woman  photographer."  </P> <P> Camacho entered the national spotlight last month after he lay near death in  the brushy median of Interstate 5 in Oceanside for four days, as hundreds of  thousands of motorists passed by without noticing him.  </P> <P> At the end of his 92-hour saga -- in which the delirious Camacho drank water  from a roadside sprinkler and several times thought he heard the telephone  wires overhead answering his calls -- he was spotted by a motorist after  crawling from the cover of thick oleander bushes and back onto the road  shoulder.  </P> <P> Camacho, who suffered a shattered pelvis, broken arm and shoulder and internal  injuries, was trying to cross the busy freeway shortly before dusk one Saturday  when he was apparently struck from behind by a hit-and-run driver. When he was  rescued by paramedics the following Wednesday afternoon, his body was wracked  with infection. (His hospital bills -- estimated by doctors to be in the  hundreds of thousands of dollars -- are being paid by Scripps.)  </P> <P> Nearly a month after his ordeal, Camacho still cannot understand why so many  Americans have become fascinated with his gutsy efforts to stay alive. Those  who have come to know him say that, as an undocumented laborer living at a  rural, makeshift campsite since his arrival in the United States four years  ago, Camacho's everyday existence has been a tale of determined survival.  </P> <P> Suddenly, however, he's become an object of attention for reporters from more  than a dozen newspapers, magazines and TV stations -- all of whom want to tell  the painful details of a struggle that played itself out within an arm's reach  of one of the world's busiest freeways.  </P> <P> "To him, he did nothing that he considered heroic," said Terri Marquez, a  Spanish-speaking nurse's aide who has interpreted interviews for Camacho and  still visits him regularly.  </P> <P> "The life he has led in the migrant camps the past few years has taught him how  to be a survivor, how to find water, go without food. So surviving is nothing  new to him.  </P> <P> "He just doesn't understand why he's become such a celebrity. It's not just a  language barrier, it's a cultural barrier as well."  </P> <P> Although his infections and resulting fever have blurred Camacho's memory of  the details of his ordeal, he has nonetheless struggled -- time and again -- to  answer reporters' questions.  </P> <P> "He told me that so many people want the details of what was going on in his  mind during those long days and nights," Marquez said. "But he's frustrated. He  says, 'How can I tell them how I felt if I'm not sure of the words myself?' "  </P> <P> Along with the intrusion, there is a positive side to all the attention,  Camacho acknowledges: the cheery get-well cards and letters that just keep  coming, from Maine, Nevada, Missouri and British Columbia -- places Camacho had  never even heard of.  </P> <P> They come written in both Spanish and English. Some have religious overtones,  others include checks and a word of good luck. Children have written endearing  letters full of pictures of stick men meant to represent Camacho lying by the  roadside. Still other letters offer jobs and sundry rays of hope:  </P> <P> "Please come to Alaska, go to adult school and get a good job," one letter  reads. "Employers in Alaska want courageous people like you."  </P> <P> Another letter responded to earlier reports that Camacho had yet to tell his  sickly mother back home in Oaxaca of his ordeal: "Call your mother," the male  writer advised. "Even though she's sick, she still worries and cares about you.  I mean, if I care about you, imagine how she feels."  </P> <P> The letter Camacho most cherishes came from Reagan, who drew from his own  mishaps to offer a note of hope: "This is a difficult time for you; however,  from personal experience, we have found that your burden can become lighter if  you trust in the Lord and in those who care about you."  </P> <P> The letters, Camacho says, are bright spots that balance out the nightmares he  still has about the incident. He plans to answer each of them in person.  </P></p>

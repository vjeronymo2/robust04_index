			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / International Company News: CHH brothers step down after shift in control THE TWIN brothers Richard and Ken Carter, who built Carter Holt Harvey (CHH) from a small family company into New Zealand's largest forestry group, are stepping down, writes Terry Hall in Wellington. This follows the sale by Brierley Investments (BIL) of a 16 per cent stake in CHH - half BIL's shareholding - to International Paper, the large US forest products group. Under the agreement, International Paper is to take over management control of CHH. Under management changes, Mr Selwyn Cushing, a BIL director, is to replace Mr Richard Carter, CHH executive chairman. Mr David Oskin, a senior vice-president of International Paper, becomes managing director and chief executive of CHH.</p>

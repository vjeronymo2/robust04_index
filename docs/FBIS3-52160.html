Our correspondent Hayim Hecht reports that  a Finance Ministry team will depart for Paris tomorrow. It is  possible that the heads of the delegations, Finance Minister  Avraham Shohat and the PLO's Abu-al-'Ala' [Ahmad Quray'], will  arrive in Paris toward the end of the week.    At the opening of today's cabinet meeting Prime Minister  Yitzhaq Rabin spoke with great firmness against the way in which  the Palestinians are conducting the negotiations. The prime  minister said he is willing to resume the Taba talks only on the  basis of the understandings reached in Cairo. Mr. Rabin said  that Israel is in no hurry, and that the Palestinians should  start sweating now. According to Rabin, over the last few days  it has transpired that we cannot count on oral understandings  with the PLO leaders, and henceforth he will demand that all the  understandings reached with them be written down.    Earlier today Prime Minister Rabin and Foreign Minister  Peres  held an hour-long private meeting. The prime minister also held  consultations with various security services elements, and this  afternoon these consultations will continue.</p>

			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Haemocell loss marginally lower The delay of US regulatory approval for its S350 blood filtering process held back annual results at Haemocell, the maker of medical and surgical equipment. The USM-quoted company had hoped that approval would be granted towards the end of the year. Sales rose from Pounds 295,000 to Pounds 676,000, but expenses related to preparations for the US launch and general product development resulted in a marginally reduced loss of Pounds 1.69m (Pounds 1.75m). Losses per share were 9.9p (11.6p). US approval was granted for the drug on October 6, since when a 1-for-4 rights issue has been launched to raise Pounds 6.1m to cut debt and for working capital.</p>

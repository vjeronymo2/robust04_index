			<p><P> November 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FISHING NOTES: CHANGING SEASONS SIGNAL ROCK COD ACTION IN DEEP WATER  </P> <P> Seasons change and so do the species of fish anglers will be trying for in the  fall and winter.  </P> <P> With surface fish not as plentiful, the most sought-after will be rock cod.  </P> <P> Anglers will be bringing out stout rods and big reels to fish depths from 150  to more than 600 feet.  </P> <P> Another popular method is to bounce a heavy jig on the bottom or use the  five-hook ganion with a lead weight of a pound or more.  </P> <P> There are more than 50 species of rock fish that can be brought to the surface.  Among the most popular are the salmon grouper, ling cod, red snapper and the  cow cod, which, when caught deep, floats to the top.  </P> <P> Although rock fish will represent most of the catches, all landings will  schedule combination surface and bottom fish trips.  </P> <P> There are many rock spots in the South Bay and outer islands.  </P> <P> The angler who ventures out on a cod trip for the first time will discover all  the cellar dwellers are considered excellent eating.  </P> <P> With a good supply of squid, all indications point to a good white sea bass  season.  </P> <P> King Harbor Marlin Club member Jerry Austin has added to the club's  tag-and-release program again.  </P> <P> Fishing from his boat Geronimo and using only eight-pound test line, he hooked  a marlin and, after setting the hook, battled the jumper for two hours and 27  minutes before it came alongside the boat so Austin could insert a tag and  release it.  </P> <P> The estimated weight was 130 pounds. This catch brings the club's total to 40  for this season.  </P> <P> With the marlin season winding down, the weigh station at Avalon has been  closed for the year by Rose Cadman, who has been weighing marlin for 22 years.  </P> <P> Cadman said a weigh-in season record was established, as she counted 393,  shattering the mark of 333 set in 1967.  </P> <P> She said this figure doesn't count the marlin released.  </P> <P> South Bay Catches: Gary Budd of Gardena, fishing aboard the Southern Cal, used  cut squid to hook the whopper of the week, a ling cod that weighed 33 pounds.  </P> <P> Gene Gorlack of San Pedro, on a two-day trip aboard the Top Gun, caught the  jackpot fish at San Clemente Island, a 24-pound yellowtail pulled out of the  kelp.  </P> <P> Larry Hera of West Los Angeles, fishing aboard the Sea Spray at Rocky Point,  won the jackpot with a 17-pound white sea bass.  </P> <P> Frank Gasper of San Pedro, on the Shogun at Catalina Island, caught an 18-pound  yellowtail.  </P> <P> Marie Ellis of Lomita, fishing aboard the Hitless Miss at the oil rigs, caught  a 14 1/2-pound salmon grouper.  </P> <P> Fish Reports: The bonito and sculpin bite at Rocky Point continues. Santa  Monica Bay has been best for some good-sized halibut.  </P> <P> Rock cod fishing has been rated good for both shallow and deep-rock areas.  </P> <P> At Marina del Rey Sportfishing: The Betty O rock cod special fished the  Rockpile and anglers sacked 270 rock cod and 10 ling cod.  </P> <P> The Del Mar trip to Sunset Beach garnered 125 sculpin, 35 calico bass and seven  halibut.  </P> <P> The Happyman ventured on two half-day trips to Santa Monica Bay and returned  with 28 halibut and 40 sculpin.  </P> <P> At Redondo Sportfishing: Anglers on the Sea Spray, fishing Rocky Point, scored  with 284 sculpin, 72 calico bass and six halibut.  </P> <P> The Redondo Special anglers on the morning half-day trip landed 320 sculpin and  93 calico bass.  </P> <P> The Blackjack rock cod trip to San Clemente Island resulted in a wide-open  whitefish count of 220, plus 50 sheepshead.  </P> <P> The Isle of Redondo barge accounted for 495 mackerel and 41 rockfish.  </P> <P> At 22nd Street Landing: The First String worked the west end of Catalina Island  for a catch of 206 bonito, 100 blue perch, 12 calico bass and nine sheepshead.  </P> <P> The Monte Carlo half-day trip to White's Point resulted in a bonito bite of  155, plus 41 calico bass.  </P> <P> The Daiwa on a two-day rock cod trip to Cherry Bank returned with 236 reds and  16 cow cod.  </P> <P> At L.A.

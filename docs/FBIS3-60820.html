			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITIM] </F>   [Text] The security forces have stopped hunting for Fatah  fugitives in the Gaza District who murdered Israelis and  Palestinians, under an agreement reached between senior Fatah  leaders in the district and IDF [Israel Defense Forces]  commanders in the region.    An IDF source confirmed the report, adding that it was  forced  upon the army, and that some IDF officers in the field are  furious with the agreement.    At a meeting held two weeks ago, the two sides agreed the  IDF  would completely halt its pursuit of armed Fatah fugitives,  including those known to have committed murder. According to  the agreement, the IDF agreed there would be no active pursuit  of these fugitives, but that if they happened to be caught, they  would be arrested by the security forces.    It was agreed brothers 'Umar and Rajih Abu-Sittah, believed  to have murdered, among others, Shaya Deutsch of Kfar Yam in  Qatif Bloc last March, would have to hide in one place and not  walk the streets. The IDF agreed not to pursue them despite the  fact that they are suspected murderers.</p>

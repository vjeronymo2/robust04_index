			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Gatt chief warns on ratification Mr Peter Sutherland, director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, said yesterday that the process of ratifying the Uruguay Round trade accords was 'definitely moving in the right direction' but warned that stated intentions had yet to be reflected in concrete results. Just 26 of the 125 countries taking part in the Uruguay Round have ratified or concluded 'domestic processes'. Most have been waiting on the 'Quad' group of leading traders, the US, the European Union, Japan and Canada, none of which has yet ratified. The accords, including establishment of Gatt's successor, the World Trade Organisation, are due to take effect on January 1 next year. Speaking to a meeting of the WTO preparatory committee, Mr Sutherland said the meeting on October 25 would be a 'watershed'. That is when he hopes to fix the date and agenda for the implementing conference, planned for December, which will formally decide when the WTO is established. Asked to report on how ratification procedures were going, all four Quad members expressed confidence ratification would be completed by the January 1 deadline. Mr Booth Gardner, US ambassador to Gatt, said the administration would submit legislation soon and expected a vote before Congress recesses on October 15. The EU, struggling to surmount a complex legal dispute over respective responsibilities of the executive Commission and member states on trade issues, said it was still committed to the January deadline. Mr Jean-Pierre Leng, EU Gatt ambassador, expressed confidence the process would be completed in good time. This is despite the fact that no accord has yet been reached on an EU code of trade conduct, which would obviate the wait for a ruling by the European Court. The Japanese government expects approval of implementing legislation during the special two-month Diet session due to start on September 30. Canada plans to introduce legislation next month. Also yesterday, Mr Andras Szepesi of Hungary, chairman of Gatt's contracting parties, said he would begin consultations early next month on the future head of the WTO. The decision, for which a consensus is needed, must be endorsed at Gatt's annual meeting in December. Mr Szepesi confirmed that the Brazilian candidate, Mr Rubens Ricupero, was standing down. The three declared contestants are outgoing President Carlos Salinas de Gortari of Mexico, Mr Renato Ruggiero of Italy and Mr Kim Chul-su of South Korea.</p>

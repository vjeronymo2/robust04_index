			<p>910513 FT  13 MAY 91 / Savouring the first taste of democracy 'SAVE DEMOCRACY, change society' says a slogan scrawled on a wall in Kathmandu. It has been just a year since the people of Nepal marched through the streets demanding multi-party elections and a new constitution to limit the power of their monarch, King Birendra Bir Bikram Shah Dev. Yesterday, 11m of the Himalayan kingdom's 18m people went to the polls to exercise their new rights. Voters lined up hours before polling stations opened at 8am, with many then waiting hours to vote. 'I am voting for the party that I like,' said a 77-year-old woman. Beaming with pride, she added: 'This is the first time I have voted in my life.' The two main parties in the race for parliamentary seats are the Congress party and the Nepalese Communist party, former partners in the interim coalition government which has ruled for a year. In Kirtipur, on the outskirts of Kathmandu, voters queued at the local Hindu shrine doubling as a polling station. 'I am very, very happy to vote, even if I have to wait in the queue for five hours,' said Surendra, 22, a business student at the local college. He said he voted for the Congress party, but he stood with arms linked around his friend, Ram, 20, who says he voted for the Communists. 'This town will divide half for Congress, half for the Communists,' said Ram, 'but it will not cause any problems. The elections decide only the parliament and not our relationships. The government may not last, but friendships will.' More than 75,000 policemen and 100,000 soldiers were called out to guard polling stations. Soldiers armed with submachine-guns patrolled the streets in armoured vehicles, despite a promise from the government to deploy troops only in the event of violence. Shops in all of the big cities were closed for election day and the streets of the capital were virtually empty, in stark contrast to the frenzied days of campaigning that led up to the election. For weeks Nepal has been besieged by party vehicles, blaring slogans and playing Nepalese folk music 24 hours a day. Walls, buses, trees, and houses are covered with colourful drawings of the various party symbols - cows, trees, suns, and fish  - as well as Nepali and English graffito asking for voter support. Mr Krishna Prasad Bhattarai, the prime minister and leader of the Congress party, toured the country in an army helicopter for four days before polling. Throughout Nepal engineers set up computers, facsimile machines and high-speed printers in preparation for voting. Mr Anders Koldby, a Danish consultant whose government contributed Dollars 1m of computer equipment to the Nepal Election Commission, said: 'Our biggest problem is that only 50 districts have telephones. In the other 25 districts, we are trying to run fax machines by battery.' The election commission now has 26 computers and 50 districts have fax machines. Mr Neel Kantha Uprety, co-ordinator of the computer division of the Election Commission, said the problem was to convince people they could work with the equipment. 'Some are afraid to touch a computer. They see it as a magic box. It's a whole new world for us.'</p>

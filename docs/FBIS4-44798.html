			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Jean-Pierre Casamayou: "GKN (Great-Britain) </F> Gains Control of Westland"--first paragraph is AIR &amp;  COSMOS/AVIATION MAGAZINE INTERNATIONAL introduction]    [Text] The diversified British group succeeds in  taking over the helicopter manufacturer after gaining control of  over 54 percent of its stock.    It took the GKN group over one and a half months of fighting  on the stock exchange to win its takeover bid for the Westland  helicopter manufacturer. It had to raise its offer to about 5  billion French francs [Fr] before the last institutional  shareholders would agree to sell their shares so that GKN would  own 54.4 percent of the Westland stock. Westland's Fr3.8 billion  of aeronautical activities will therefore be consolidated with  GKN's activities, forming a diversified group worth a little  over Fr25 billion in sales, including Fr3.6 billion in the  defense sector.    At present, the GKN group, which achieved sales of Fr21.3  billion in 1993, is not very active (5 percent) in the defense  field. This small activity involves light armored vehicles of  the Warrior family (700 units manufactured so far), and Saxon  wheeled vehicles (146 units manufactured). Its main activities,  however, lie in the field of mechanical automotive equipment (53  percent), agricultural equipment (18 percent), industrial  services (15 percent), and distribution (9 percent).    GKN's interest in the helicopter manufacturer dates back to  1988, when it took over 22 percent of the capital held by Fiat  and Hanson, during the "Westland affair." This also gave it a  chance to appoint two directors on the Westland board. Early  this year, United Technologies, the parent company of Sikorsky,  sold its 18.7-percent interest, so that GKN then owned 47  percent of the stock. The group then launched its takeover bid,  which was said to be hostile because Alan Jones, the Westland  chief executive officer, wanted above all to retain his group's  independence.    Actually, after the events of 1988, the Yeovil helicopter  manufacturer recovered quite well. It drastically reduced its  costs (at the cost of 2,000 layoffs) and doubled its backlog of  orders (to Fr12 billion). In 1993, its profits increased by 60  percent (Fr260 million), with sales of Fr3.8 billion, thanks in  particular to sales of spare parts for its base of 1,000  machines in operation. It even achieved a small feat, achieving  sales of Fr2.5 billion on the helicopter market (with a Fr250  million profit) while delivering only four units! As for its  prospects, they rest essentially on the EH-101 transport  helicopter, which it will start delivering in 1996 and for which  the potential market is estimated at 750 units; and on the  Apache combat helicopter that Westland will manufacture under  license if it is chosen by the government.    With Westland among its assets, the GKN group will  strengthen  its defense pole and constitute a consistent line of military  products well placed on the post-cold war markets: rapid action  relying on high-speed (air and land) vehicles. Moreover, this  acquisition should enable the new group to obtain some tax  benefits, and to have a better debt-equity ratio and a complete  line to offer during industrial compensation negotiations.</p>

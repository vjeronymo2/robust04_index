The MQSA requires the establishment of a Federal certification and inspection program for mammography facilities; regulations and standards for accrediting bodies for mammography facilities; and standards for mammography equipment, personnel, and practices, including quality assurance. This regulation, which amends two previously published interim rules, modifies and adds to the definitions previously set forth. In addition, the interim rule provides a mechanism to request permission to meet alternative requirements, other than those previously set forth, if the proposed alternative requirement is at least as effective as the existing quality standards in achieving quality mammography services for women. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  The interim regulation is effective October 1, 1994; written comments by December 29, 1994.

Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The MQSA (Pub. L. 102&hyph;539) was enacted to establish minimum, national quality standards for mammography. The MQSA requires that, to provide mammography services legally after October 1, 1994, all facilities, except facilities of the Department of Veterans Affairs, must be both accredited by an approved accrediting body and certified by the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) (the Secretary). The authority to approve accreditation bodies and to certify facilities has been delegated by the Secretary to FDA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The MQSA was passed on October 27, 1992, in response to statistics on the prevalence of breast cancer across the United States. Breast cancer is now the most common cancer, and the second leading cause of cancer deaths among women. According to the 1992 projections by the American Cancer Society, there would be 180,000 new cases of breast cancer among women in the United States in just that year. Of these new cases, it was estimated that approximately 46,000 of these women would die from the disease. The lifetime risk of developing breast cancer is increasing. In 1992, breast cancer affected 1 in 8 women in their lifetime as compared to 1 in 11 in 1980, 1 in 14 in 1960, and 1 in 20 in 1940.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Early detection of breast cancer, typically involving physical breast examination and mammography, is the best means of preventing deaths that result from breast cancer detected at an advanced stage. The value of undergoing mammography screening is that mammography can detect cancers that are too small to be felt through physical examination (palpation). Mammograms can detect breast cancer up to 2 years before a woman or her doctor can feel a lump. In addition, these early stage cancers can be 90 to 100 percent curable (Ref. 1).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, according to the General Accounting Office (GAO), a mammogram is one of the most difficult radiographic images to read. It must have optimal clarity for the image to be interpreted correctly. If the image quality is poor or the interpretation is faulty, the interpreter may miss an incipient cancerous lesion. This could delay treatment and result in an avoidable death or mastectomy. Further, it is equally true that poor images or faulty interpretations can lead to a false positive diagnosis, which produces needless patient anxiety, costly additional testing, and painful biopsies when normal tissue is misread as abnormal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

The promise to bring Crimea back into the  ruble area under the Russian umbrella, abandoning the ruined  Ukrainian economy to itself, will be short-lived, they say, in  view of Moscow's indifference and [Ukrainian President]  Kravchuk's hostility. So he will soon be a president with no  powers, like the queen of England.    But Yuriy Meshkov does not seem at all like a queen. And  Crimea is not reminiscent of England. It is much more like  Karabakh, Georgia, and the Moldovan lands of the Dniester, where  offended and desolate men have been attacking each other, first  in the elections and the referendum, then with ultimatums, and  last with hatred and weapons, in order to defend their own  "sacrosanct" rights.    [Cucurnia] Mr. President, you said today that soon the  citizens of Crimea will be summoned to a referendum on  independence. You went on to explain that you do not intend to  take the republic out of Ukraine and that there will be no  territorial problems. In our country we say that you cannot eat  soup and blow on it at the same time. How do you intend to  reconcile these two positions?    [Meshkov] The status of an independent republic is not an  end  in itself. We have only one wish: to salvage ourselves. That  is, to set our economy back on a sound footing. If in order to  do so it is not necessary to modify Crimea's status, then we  will not do so. But if anyone tries to obstruct us, then we will  be forced somehow to guarantee our autonomy in the economic  field.    [Cucurnia] Do you mean that you reserve the right to leave  Ukraine?    [Meshkov] I personally do not see the need for it, but the  political situation is very complex and unpredictable, precisely  because of the disastrous economic situation. In our country  there is no longer any stability, there is so much crime, so  much disintegration and poverty that social explosions and  revolts cannot be ruled out, and we must defend our citizens.    [Cucurnia] At your news conference you said that you want to  turn Crimea into a bridge between Russia and Ukraine. But apart  from the deafening silence on Russia's part and Kravchuk's  attempts at reconciliation, the whole of western Ukraine rejects  the very idea of your independence. Do you not think that  somebody will try to blow up your bridge?    [Meshkov] The experience of the former Soviet republics has  set in motion some obscure and ambivalent mechanisms, a mixture  of centrifugal thrusts and hopes of reintegration.  Unfortunately the former prevailed in the initial phase and  paved the way for a tide of nationalism in the lands of the  former USSR. Leadership groups came to power that have  neglected economic problems, since they were busy with gaining  and retaining power. Those who were most keen to break the  bridges and to isolate themselves, such as Ukraine, have  suffered the most. Crimea's territorial problem is certainly  not the most serious problem that Ukraine has to face, keeping  in mind the fact that even outside Crimea feelings have changed  and many people long for what they have lost.    [Cucurnia] Mr. President, according to the official figures,  over a million people voted for you yesterday. How many of them  do you think voted for a reunion with Russia?    [Meshkov] The nostalgia that we all feel for that stable and  secure past that we knew is perfectly understandable; the memory  has not disappeared from our awareness. Just as communist  ideology has not disappeared. It is wrong for the international  economic structures to lay down the law, without taking account  of the situation and minds of the people who make this economy  function. And people now are being forced to choose: Behind us  we have left a secure world that turned into decline and poverty  when we were promised a market economy. Whether to move forward  toward these horrors, or to rebuild a decent life? Those who  voted for me do not want a return to communism, but they do want  to reform the economy and to restore everyone's fundamental  rights. We give priority to the rights of the citizens, not  those of the state. The state must concern itself with the  people, and not vice versa. But if the international community  abandons us, unless it tries to influence the decisions adopted  by Kiev, which has shown itself to be incapable of economic  management, unless Ukraine's brutal actions are discouraged, the  situation in Crimea could really become red hot.    [Cucurnia] But are you aware that Crimea is surrounded by  the interests of two nuclear powers, Ukraine and Russia, not to  mention Turkey, which has promised support to the Tatar  minority, who hail from these lands?    [Meshkov] I feel the full burden of the responsibility that  I  have shouldered. These are hard and embittered times. I am  perfectly well aware of the gravity of the situation, especially  since I learned that the director of the CIA devoted his report  to the issue of the elections in Crimea. But nobody will  understand our problems and the fact that Crimea's internal  structure rules out the explosion of conflicts. The only thing  that could provoke these people is economic collapse, in which  case social processes will become impossible to control. But we  have no internal ethnic or religious conflicts or any  nationalist movements seeking justice against history. Russia  and Ukraine have always been good neighbors. The only serious  problem is the Black Sea Fleet, and Ukraine should have the  courage to admit that it is Russian and indivisible.    [Cucurnia] What about the Tatars, who opposed your elections  with all their strength?    [Meshkov] I am disappointed about the statements by their  leader Mustafa Dzhemilev [name as received], who has said that  he cannot rule out armed resistance by the Tatars for a solution  of their national problems. This really is too much.  Fortunately, the Tatar intelligentsia and a large proportion of  the people do not agree with these statements. Be that as it  may, it cannot influence the Crimean citizens' legitimate desire  to build a viable future.</p>

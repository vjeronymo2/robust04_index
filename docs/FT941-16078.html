			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / Management: Change is not enough - Christopher Lorenz on calls for a revolution among managers Richard Pascale, scourge of the complacent and prodder of the timid, is acting as 'facilitator' at a workshop of senior executive teams from 16 leading multinationals, including Black &amp; Decker, British Airways, BP, Monsanto, Nissan and Unilever. He listens to them patiently for several hours as they enumerate a string of seemingly impressive improvements that their companies have introduced in the past four years: in customer responsiveness, total quality, cost reduction, supply management, European organisation and teamwork. Only occasionally does he interrupt to ask a question. But it is almost always a variant of the same phrase: 'Are any of these really breakthroughs?' The executives shuffle sheepishly, having heard Pascale speak earlier in the day about the need for corporate 'transformation'. Eventually one bursts out: 'I don't believe in breakthroughs - fast incremental change is what gets results.' The other participants laugh awkwardly, some in relief, others because they know that Pascale, in spite of his politeness, is disappointed in them. Some later admit privately to disappointment with themselves. This episode, at a recent three-day meeting at a hotel near Arundel in southern England, epitomises the discomfort that many managers feel at the power of the challenging gospel according to this Californian teacher, writer and consultant: that, for many large companies in today's viciously competitive world, change is not enough - nothing short of a revolution will save them. With executives from troubled IBM and Kodak in the audience, the point should not need ramming home. But it does, because it is unpalatable, even frightening. Pascale explained why in an article in the latest issue of the Harvard Business Review, written with a colleague, Tracey Goss*. 'What many chief executives are missing is that incremental change is not enough for many companies today. 'Managers groping about for a more fundamental shift in their organisations' capabilities must realise that change programmes treat symptoms, not underlying conditions. These companies do not need to improve themselves, they need to reinvent themselves.' 'Reinvention is not changing what is, but creating what isn't,' Pascale continues. 'A butterfly is not more caterpillar or a better or improved caterpillar; a butterfly is a different creature.' One of Pascale's problems in motivating managers such as those at the Arundel meeting of the Inter-Company Productivity Group - its activities are far more ambitious than its name suggests - is that precious few large companies measure up to his definition of 'reinvention' and 'transformation'. On a conspicuously short list of European paragons he cites British Airways and Shorts, the Belfast aircraft and missile maker. Europcar, the rental chain, and the European arm of Haagen-Dazs ice cream are also trying to reinvent themselves, he says. In the US he points to Ford, Intel, part - but not all - of General Electric, and, above all, Motorola, which, by sustaining its reinventive capacity, has been able to compete in a succession of different industries over several decades. The reasons for the scarcity of 'reinvention' cases are not hard to find, Pascale says ruefully. He enthuses a company's top managers into embracing the gospel of transformation, only to find them backing off when they discover how conflict-ridden and wrenching the shift can be. Normally very discreet, Pascale has been known to castigate the heads of AT&amp;T, Whirlpool and one BP division for getting cold feet when what he calls 'executive reinvention' became too painful for the people at the top. Beneath this surface drama lies a more fundamental challenge: that, in order to reinvent itself, a company must alter what Pascale calls 'its context - the underlying assumptions and invisible premises on which its decisions and actions are based'. Rather than just concerning itself with new types of 'doing', he continues, it must alter its 'being' - its inner nature. That is not the same thing as its culture, it is deeper and more active. Lest anyone thinks he has converted to the mumbo-jumbo of New Age spiritualism, he hastens to point out that the Japanese recognise the differences between doing and one's inner being (kokoro) in their everyday speech. On more familiar ground for westerners, he cites the difficulties other US retailers have had capturing what he calls the 'magic' of Nordstrom, a remarkably successful but controversial store chain based in Seattle. Its rivals 'don't seem to realise that Nordstrom sales people live its motto of 'Respond to Unreasonable Customer Requests',' he says. To most staff at competing stores, such a principle means that the customer comes first - within reason. Customer demands must be met - unless they are ridiculous. But at Nordstrom each ridiculous request is an opportunity for an 'heroic act' by an employee - like the San Francisco woman who got up early one morning to fetch a pair of shoes in my size from a different branch several miles away. Faced with the painful need to reinvent who they and their companies are rather than just what they do, it is not surprising that most senior executives decide to take the seemingly easier route of incremental change. This involves what Pascale calls 'trying harder', going 'back to basics', and searching for 'improvement' techniques. Until recently Pascale used to condemn this 'fork in the road' decision as leading, more often than not, to 'stagnation and decline'; the diagram he used in presentations said as much. But at Arundel and other meetings in the past few months he has removed those three words from the slide. He fears they may demotivate companies which, having achieved considerable improvements through conventional means, could suddenly find they have laid the foundation for a quantum leap into 'reinvention'. Coming from an evangelist as thoughtful as Pascale, such a shift in conversion tactics is understandable. But it risks muddying his message. The organisers of the Arundel meeting report that some participants have since said that 'we don't want to be told 'you've done very well, keep on taking the medicine'. We want more powerful treatment, even if it's painful'. *HBR Nov-Dec 93. Reprint 93603. Fax (USA) 617-495-6985. Previous articles on corporate creativity appeared on Oct 4 and 15, and Nov 17.</p>

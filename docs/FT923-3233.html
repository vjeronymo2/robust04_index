			<p>920914 FT  14 SEP 92 / Survey on Mauritius (7): Names are not much to go by - Michael Holman reviews the political scene IF NAMES were anything to go by, Mauritius is governed by an alarming alliance of two radical parties clinging to discredited ideologies. But the Mouvement Socialiste Mauricien (MSM) is not socialist, no more than the Mouvement Militant Mauricien (MMM) is militant. The labels hark back to past enthusiasms, for the MSM/MMM coalition led by Sir Anerood Jugnauth, the prime minister, advocates a market economy and straddles the political centre. Nor does the opposition Labour Party, headed by Dr Navin Ramgoolam and in alliance with the Parti Mauricien Social Democrat (PMSD), offer a radical alternative. Although he is not short of ammunition with which to attack the government, Dr Rangoolam makes clear his support for the economic formula that has proved so successful in Mauritius. 'However, the economy is running into serious difficulties but government has run out of steam,' says the son of the late Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam, the first prime minister of Mauritius who led the island to independence from Britain in 1968. 'The export processing zone needs more investment in higher technology, skills training has been inadequate. And on the environment government has been all talk and little action.' Dr Ramgoolam, 45, who qualified as a doctor at Dublin and is on his way to becoming a barrister, saves his most passionate criticism for three issues: the government's decision to opt for republican status, alleged failure to crack down on drugs, and the conduct of last September's general election. The result was a resounding victory for the MSM/MMM alliance: 57 assembly seats to Labour's three - a lopsided reflection of the 56 to 40 per cent shares of the votes cast. 'It was blatantly rigged,' claims Dr Ramgoolam, amid counter charges by government. The Labour Party has taken its case to court. Dr Ramgoolam is especially critical of the government's decision to make Mauritius a republic, formally enacted on the independence anniversary, March 12. 'I support the move in principle, but there should have been a referendum,' he argues, and expresses especial concern that that government may end the recourse to the Privy Council as a final court of appeal. 'We need this constitutional safeguard,' says Dr Ramgoolam. He takes heart from the recent village council elections which, he argues, showed a swing against the government. The results are difficult to interpret, for candidates do not stand under the political partys' banner. But coupled with recent rumblings from the unions, pushing for wage increases, they may serve as a warning against complacency to Sir Anerood, enjoying his 10th year in office. His lengthy tenure owes much to skilful political footwork, ending one alliance and embarking on another - the latest being with the MMM, based on a bargain struck in July 1990. Sir Anerood turned to Mr Paul Berenger, the key figure in the MMM, which the two men helped found in 1970. The Mouvement swept to power in the 1982 election, winning all 60 mainland seats (the island of Rodrigues has two assembly members). But nine months later Sir Anerood and Mr Berenger parted company. The differences between the two men involved personality rather than policy. In his short tenure as finance minister Mr Berenger began the implementation of the economic reform programme, followed through by Sir Anerood after he left the MMM to create the Mouvement Socialiste Militant, the party he leads to this day. Although Dr Prem Nababsing, the deputy prime minister, heads the MMM, the enigmatic Mr Berenger remains the key figure in the party. Unlikely ever to become prime minister by virtue of his Franco-Mauritian origins  - an electoral liability on an island where 52 per cent of the 1.1m population are Hindu, and 17 per cent Moslem - he can play the role of kingmaker. Whether the alliance can hold remains to be seen: 'Breaking and forging coalitions is a political way of life in Mauritius', says one veteran observer. The main reason is not hard to find. As Dr Ram Mannick, a UK-based Mauritian academic comments in his book, Mauritius: The Politics of Change*, there is very little to choose between the various parties: 'Consensus politics rules the day,' he notes. This principle accounts for one of the island's strengths - stability. But as Dr Mannick pointed out: 'The danger is that politics becomes opportunistic - a game to get into government rather than a debate over policy issues.' 'Real problems might be forgotten,' he warns, 'while politicians struggle for positions.' *Dodo Books, Mayfield College, East Sussex TN20 6PL</p>

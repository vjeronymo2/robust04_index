			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: compiled by </F> Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy; edited by Vladimir  Shishlin]    [Text] President Akayev pins great hopes on broader  economic cooperation with Japan and on greater Japanese  investment in specific projects.    Akayev told Japanese Ambassador Kiji Watanabe during the  ceremony of the presentation of credentials, that since the  first days of independence, Bishkek and Tokyo had been  maintaining relations of trust and friendship. "No other  country helps us more than Japan in promoting economic  restructuring and the reorganization of the banking and  communication systems," he said.    On the same day, Kyrgyz Prime Minister Apas Zhumagulov met  with Japanese businessmen to discuss the role of Japan in the  economic restructuring program. He proposed that Japan invest  in the Kyrgyz defense, machine-building and agriculture-related  industries.    Zhumagulov said that only about 8 percent of Kyrgyzstan's  hydro-energy resources were used, and that Japan's participation  in the construction of small, medium and big hydro-power plants  might benefit both countries.    As an example of bilateral cooperation he referred to the  plant for the production of semiconductors which is being built  in the south of Kyrgyzstan. This plant is expected to  manufacture 1000 tonnes of poly-and mono-crystal silicon a year.    Zhumagulov told Interfax that relations between Kyrgyzstan  and Japan were broadening and that he expected much of the  Kyrgyz-Japanese committee for economic cooperation, which is to  meet in Tokyo next November.</p>

The resolution replaces the earlier order that allowed to  waive import duties on certain categories of goods. The duty  will vary from 15 percent to 20 percent depending on whether the  exporter country has a free trade agreement with Latvia, Osis  said.    The lowest tariff is levied on raw materials, which are  being  brought in to supply the local industry.    Imported products that can be made on the spot will be taxed  45 percent, Osis said.    The tariffs are tailored to protect the domestic market, the  minister noted. Simultaneously, Osis conceded, the tariffs  increase alone is unable to protect the Latvian market. Latvia  should also improve the tax collection mechanism and customs  control, he said.    The new tariffs take effect 30 days after their publication  in the LATVIJAS VESTNESIS newspaper.    In other actions, the Cabinet gave the go-ahead for the  liquidation of a series of profitless state-run enterprises and  adopted the order for repayment of excise taxes on diesel fuel,  which were earlier paid by Latvian farmers in accordance with an  erroneous government resolution.</p>

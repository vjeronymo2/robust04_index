			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / Survey of International Hotels (7): Feeling at home - North America Imagine coming home after a hard day at work to a round of cocktails in your sitting room, then lighting a fire in the hearth and relaxing, looking out over a garden courtyard. Perhaps later in the evening you order the week's groceries by telephone, and fix a light supper. In the morning the day's newspapers will be delivered free to your door, and you look forward to sharing a cooked-to-order breakfast, also free, with your neighbours. If this does not sound exactly like home, that is because it is increasingly the way US hoteliers make travellers feel at home away from home. Do not be deceived by the perks, because this treatment is considered 'limited service', and can be far less expensive than full-service hotels. For business travellers required to make long sojourns at a single location this trend is particularly good news, because rock-bottom prices become even lower for extended stays. A large part of this trend is the proliferation of 'all suite' hotels, which offer separate living and sitting rooms, and often a mini-kitchen. This arrangement is a boon to women business travellers who appreciate having a separate bedroom and meeting area, and to families who can take advantage of fold-out couches in sitting rooms and 'kids stay free' policies to trim vacation costs. After 11 years of consecutive losses, the US hotel industry made a profit in 1993, thanks to aggressive cost-cutting and a turn to no-frills properties catering to travellers' budgets and comfort in equal measure. Recovering from record Dollars 5.2bn in losses in 1991, the US hotel industry is clawing its way back. Mr. Bjorn Hanson, chairman of the National Hospitality Consulting Group from the international consulting firm Coopers &amp; Lybrand, says that big debt restructuring, tax relief, and significant reductions in management costs have earned the industry some breathing room. He estimates that debt restructuring alone will save the industry some Dollars 2bn a year. But he believes that return to profitability will not result in significantly more hotels, but in smarter marketing strategies. His data show that for each dollar of revenue, a hotel earns 75 cents profit per room. In food service, a hotel makes only 18 cents profit on each dollar of restaurant income. As a result, new hotels, mostly in suburban locations, are leaving out in-house restaurants and the lobby bar, and asking guests to visit nearby restaurants for dinner. The savings are so great to the hotels that management usually throws in a complimentary breakfast for guests' convenience, and in some cases a free afternoon cocktail hour. The strategy is catching on quickly. Smith Travel Research reports that nearly 50 per cent of new hotel rooms which opened in the US in 1992 were suites, appealing to the more up market traveller and another 14 per cent were moderately-priced limited service hotels. Large US hotel chains, still operating flagship full-service properties, are diversifying under separate brand names into all-suite, all-suite extended-stay, and economy class reduced-service chains. Often the big operators are buying existing hotels and coverting them to the suite concept, with substantial cost savings. The leader in the suite hotel concept is Embassy Suites, with 109 properties in 31 states, and international hotels under development in Bangkok, Thailand and in Mexico. Owned by Memphis-based Promus, Embassy Suites caters to upscale business and leisure travellers. Two-room suites, two telephone lines, mini-kitchens, free breakfast and cocktails are standard at the properties, which are priced according to location but average between Dollars 99 to Dollars 115 per night. Other expanding all-suite chains include Guest Quarters Suite Hotels, and Crown Sterling Suites. The extended-stay segment of the all-suite hotel market is dominated by Residence Inns, property of international hotelier Marriott. Residence Inn offers studios with 50 per cent more room than the normal hotel room, and at least 75 per cent of the rooms include fireplaces. Free breakfast and cocktail hour and free local telephone calls are standard, while services like grocery shopping, meal delivery, and laundry are also available. Marriott has 179 of these properties scattered around the US. Promus is also competing for the long-term visitor, with its Homewood Suites offering similar amenities. The industry's definition of 'extended stay' is five or more nights. However, Marriott research shows that the average stay is 13 nights, and that international visitors stay an average of 26 nights at its Residence Inns. Prices range from Dollars 75 to Dollars 105 per night and are lower for longer stays. The US has a proliferation of budget motel chains, often strung out under the glare of freeway lights close to airports and suburban shopping areas. However, a new generation of economy hotels has arrived. These generally have the benefits of new construction, with spacious rooms, key-card security, and cheerful lobbies where generous free breakfasts are served buffet-style to guests. Owned by the larger hotel chains, these properties usually allow children to stay free; allow three or four adults to stay at a two-person rate; and offer special price packages for senior citizens. Managed to appeal to low-budget business travellers and leisure travellers on their way to vacation destinations, these hotels are typically priced between Dollars 40 and Dollars 50 per night. Marriott's Fairfield Inn and Promus's Hampton Inn hotels are typical of this class. Both these chains were started in the mid-1980s. Hampton Inn now has 376 hotels in 44 states, while Fairfield Inn has more than 130 properties in 37 states.</p>

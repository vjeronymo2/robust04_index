			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Brussels, Jan 8 (AFP) -- Deputy Belgian Prime  Minister Guy Coeme has been implicated in a corruption scandal  over a 225 million dollar army helicopter contract, according to  a leaked judicial report published by newspapers here Saturday  [8 January].    The probe says Italian constructor Agusta won the contract  by  offering a 413,000 dollar bribe to Coeme's Socialist Party, and  links the payment with bitter party infighting and the still  unresolved killing of former party boss Andre Cools.    Coeme, defence minister when the contract for 46 helicopters  was signed in 1988, faces a grilling by deputies Thursday during  a session to discuss the lifting of his parliamentary immunity.  He denies any wrongdoing.    However, the report by investigating magistrate Veronique  Ancia says "promises -- concerning the purchase of the Agusta  helicopters which was a Defence Ministry affair -- (were made)  of payments to the Socialist Party."    Ancia concludes that the 1988 contract was tainted by  numerous "injustices...and forgery."    Coeme is alleged in the report to have rejected out of hand  a  bid by German firm MBB without consulting the country's  financial watchdog, and to have cut short the examination of the  two other bids, by Agusta and the French firm Aerospatiale.    An Agusta consultant quoted in the Ancia report said Coeme  "decided to speed things up in order to avoid a lower bid from  Aerospatiale."    The report also implicates Guy Spitaels, the then Socialist  Party chief and current head of the Walloon (French-speaking)  regional government, and Socialist Senator Guy Mathot, saying  they "could be accomplices and jointly (responsible for) the  corruption of a minister."    The probe began after Cools, a former minister and Socialist  Party boss, was gunned down in July 1991.    According to the Ancia report, Cools was sidelined from the  Agusta deal and the pay-off promised by the Italian constructor,  the money going being siphoned off "following a move by the  three Guys" -- Coeme, Spitaels and Mathot.    Shortly afterwards, Cools tried to oust Spitaels as party  leader, the report noted.</p>

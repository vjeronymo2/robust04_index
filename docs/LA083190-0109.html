			<p><P> August 31, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WALLY'S WORLD HAS BECOME UNSETTLED;  </P> <P> BASEBALL: JOYNER'S KNEE IS HEALING, AND HE HOPES TO PLAY AGAIN BEFORE THE  SEASON ENDS. BUT ARE THE ANGELS IN HIS FUTURE?  </P> <P> He will play again, probably within three or four weeks. Of that much Wally  Joyner is certain.  </P> <P> "It's a setback, but with time it will heal itself and there will be no  residual side effects," Joyner said of the broken kneecap that has idled him  since July 11.  </P> <P> A few minor details must be settled before he picks up his first baseman's  glove again. One is ensuring that the tedious healing process is complete. Only  last week was Joyner permitted to begin riding an exercise bicycle and to do  isometric exercises to strengthen the muscles around the knee. And, although  trainer Ned Bergert said there's no reason he can't return this season, Joyner  said the knee still won't allow him to do strenuous work.  </P> <P> "I haven't seen any regressions, and that's helped me continue to keep my  sanity, because over the past six, seven weeks I've lost my sanity a couple of  times," he said. "One of the reasons why is my optimistic outlook. If somebody  says, 'Four to six weeks and you'll be OK,' I say, 'I'm going to be ready in  four.' The way I look at it now, the worst possible thing is that I can't play  any more this season. I look at it that way so if I come back with a week or  two left, that's a bonus."  </P> <P> When he does play again, there's another detail to be decided: What uniform he  will be wearing. It's becoming increasingly likely that if Joyner does play for  the Angels again, it would be only briefly and only to showcase him for a trade  the club has been trying to make.  </P> <P> The maturing of first baseman Lee Stevens during Joyner's absence makes Joyner  logical trade bait. His numbers and age (28) are good enough to bring a rich  return, perhaps in a deal to fill the Angels' need for a power-hitting third  baseman or an everyday second baseman.  </P> <P> "There's no sense in getting worried until something happens," Joyner said of  the notion that he has played his last game as an Angel. "It's not up to me. It  could hurt me in the long run if I said I enjoy playing here, and it could hurt  me if I said I didn't. It's up to the Angels to make that decision and to make  the moves. I've done it too many times and been disappointed too many times  making the first move."  </P> <P> This has been a year of disappointments for Joyner, who traces his injury to  being hit in the right shin by a pitch from Milwaukee's Chris Bosio on May 15  and damaging the knee by not walking properly on that leg. Joyner continued to  play on the injured knee until a stress fracture was diagnosed.  </P> <P> "Prior to the injury, I was doing well. It might have been my best season. It  could have been easily," said Joyner, who peaked at .318 on May 24 and was  hitting .268 with 41 runs batted in -- second on the club to Lance Parrish's 44  -- when he was placed on the disabled list on July 16. "But we'll never know."  </P> <P> Joyner's disappointment began last winter with a salary dispute, another in a  series of showdowns with the club. After his standout 1987 season, when he hit  .285 with 34 home runs and 117 RBIs, the Angels renewed his contract for 1988  at $340,000 after acrimonious talks. He settled shortly before an arbitration  hearing in 1989. And he went to arbitration last February to get the $1,750,000  he sought instead of the Angels' offer of $1,225,000. He will be eligible for  free agency after the 1991 season.  </P> <P> "I've never been bitter, just disappointed," Joyner said. "Arbitration doesn't  bother me at all. The negotiations don't bother me. It's the negotiations  before getting to arbitration that get me. It's frustration and more  frustration. But this is not the right time and it's not my place to talk about  that now. It's kind of hard for somebody on the disabled list to talk about  what his future with the team is."  </P> <P> He expects the future to hold many changes for the Angels, and one of those  changes could be the permanent installation at first base of Stevens, who has  done a creditable job in Joyner's absence. A solid defensive player who is  streaky at the plate but has power, Stevens is hitting .239 with 20 RBIs in 41  games. Stevens has had exactly half as many at-bats as Joyner did in 83 games,  310-155, so comparing their statistics is not unreasonable.  </P> <P> Stevens has hit five homers and scored 20 runs, which compares favorably to  Joyner's eight homers and 35 runs scored, but Joyner has more than twice  Stevens' totals of hits (83-37) and doubles (15-5). Joyner also strikes out  less, 34 times to 45 by Stevens.  </P> <P> "Obviously, he has replaced me and he plays first, but I think he's done me a  favor by playing well because there's been less pressure on me to hurry back,"  Joyner said.  </P> <P> "I know my injury is not career-ending, career-threatening. Wherever I'm  playing next year, I'll play like Wally Joyner. Hopefully, it will be for the  Angels. If not, I'll make the adjustments."  </P></p>

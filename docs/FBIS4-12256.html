			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mahmud Bakri] </F>   [Excerpt] AL-SHA'B has learned that approximately 160  senior military commanders in the Algerian Army are secretly  working with the Islamists. According to diplomatic reports,  these commanders are planning to deal a crushing blow to the  pillars of the regime in Algeria. Approximately 40 percent of  the Algerian Army's equipment and weapons has reached the hands  of Islamists between November of last year and this February.    A recent report by the U.S. State Department affirms that  the  Islamists' control of the Algerian regime would shatter  stability in the Mediterranean, Red Sea, and Arab Gulf regions.  The report expresses extreme concern at the prospects of the  Islamists' reaching power in Algeria, particularly because the  Algerian Army has proved to be extremely weak and divided before  them. The report stresses that the Algerian Army will fall  under the control of the Islamists in the next six months. The  report does not rule out the possibility that the Islamists  could rule Algeria by next year.    The report stresses the need for rapid intervention to  rescue  Algeria from the "fundamentalists" and giving the U.S. fleet in  the Mediterranean specific prerogatives to monitor the situation  and intervene immediately should conditions become unfavorable  to the government. Accordingly, reports indicate that the U.S.  Defense Department (the Pentagon) has been instructed to prepare  a plan on the various political and military possibilities in  Algeria in the coming stage and the U.S. role to deal with them.  The U.S. report stresses that the Islamists' control of the  country will be harmful to U.S. security in the Mediterranean,  Red Sea, and the Arab Gulf. [passage omitted]</p>

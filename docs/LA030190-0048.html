			<p><P> March 1, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> U.S., JAPANESE FIRMS WILL JOINTLY BUILD HOUSING DEVELOPMENT IN ESCONDIDO  </P> <P> Housing developer Leisure Technology announced Wednesday that it has entered  into a partnership with Tokyo-based Hazama USA Corp. and a consortium of three  other Japanese contractors to develop an adult community in Escondido.  </P> <P> The development is one of several housing projects recently taken on by  Japanese contractors, said Kenichi Iwao, preconstruction manager at Hazama,  which has its U.S. headquarters in Los Angeles. The Escondido deal is the  second housing project Hazama has entered into since it began doing business in  the United States in 1984.  </P> <P> Hazama, a subsidiary of Tokyo-based Hazama Corp., has since become involved in  15 development projects, including office and industrial buildings and hotels.  But the Escondido venture and a project in Long Beach, on which construction is  to begin in May, are Hazama's first housing ventures.  </P> <P> Ground breaking on the first phase of the 525-unit Escondido project, called  Leisure Oaks Escondido, is scheduled in June and will include 175  single-family, detached homes for people 55 and older.  </P> <P> The project will be similar to but smaller than Leisure Technology's 1,650-unit  Ocean Hills development in Oceanside. It will feature a 17,000-square-foot  recreation center, a nine-hole golf course, a junior Olympic swimming pool,  tennis courts and a neighborhood clubhouse.  </P> <P> The development, in the Jesmond Dene area in north Escondido, has been  challenged by slow-growth advocates in the city for 4 1/2 years, and has yet to  receive final approval from the City Council. Although the project has been  scaled down from its original 765 units, the council is still suggesting  significant revisions.  </P> <P> Among the objections raised by council members was the age restriction, with  one council member objecting to the "graying" of the community.  </P> <P> Iwao said Hazama and other Japanese contractors are exploring real estate  investments other than office buildings and hotels because of the economic  conditions in the United States.  </P> <P> "In the downtown areas, especially in Los Angeles, there is an oversupply of  office space. (Demand) is not growing at this moment, and people are not  looking to expand into the offices and move into new buildings," Iwao said.  "Also, there is too much risk involved in the hotel business."  </P> <P> The housing market, however, despite the recently flat sales in Southern  California homes, provides a much brighter outlook for development because of  projected continued population growth, he said.  </P> <P> "In the housing market, the growth ratio is much higher, especially in Southern  California due to the Pacific Rim tie-in. We expect a lot of the Japanese and  Asians coming to this market as well, as the Eastern people moving in," Iwao  said.  </P> <P> Iwao pointed out that Hazama's joint venture with Leisure Technology is neither  the first nor the largest housing venture by Japanese firms.  </P> <P> The Takamaka Corp. has already begun building in Palm Springs, and Kajima, one  of the largest Japanese contracting firms, has a residential project under way  in Las Vegas, Iwao said.  </P> <P> He said that, although housing prices in some parts of Southern California have  increased substantially, houses in inland areas and the San Diego area are more  affordable.  </P> <P> Hazama USA is the lead Japanese investor in the project, with 23% equity  interest. Other investors include Starts International California, Matsukyu USA  and N. Hasegawa. Los Angeles-based Leisure Technology, which will retain a 50%  equity interest, is the largest nationwide developer of "active adult"  retirement communities.  </P> <P> Chief Financial Officer John Kilduff estimated that revenues from the 525-unit  venture will reach $200 million over five years, but said he could not quote  the cost of the project, only that it will be "something less than" the  projected revenue. Prices for the houses have not been released.  </P> <P> The five-year project is the second venture Leisure Technology has engaged in  with Japanese firms. Last March, the firm entered a $71-million joint venture  with Nisshin Steel Co. to develop 44 full-service retirement communities over  the next 15 years, including the expansion of Leisure Technology's Ocean Hills  development in Oceanside.  </P> <P> "We had made a strategic decision that, if the company was to grow in the  future, one of the ways to do it was to go into joint ventures," Kilduff said.  "We were introduced to Hazama, and there was a commonality of interests. We  have been and continue to be very impressed with their local management."  </P></p>

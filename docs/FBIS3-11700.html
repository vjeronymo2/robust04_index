A diplomatic spokesman told the DPA that Foreign Minister  Roberto Robaina will accept an invitation extended to his  government to participate in the meeting, in which issues common  to the area will be discussed. The Third Conference of Central  American Nations and the Caribbean Common Market (Caricom) will  discuss the progress achieved in the development of democracy in  the area and a regional cooperation program. According to the  source, Cuban Foreign Minister Robaina expressed his interest in  participating in a forum like the one in San Jose, and he was  pleased with the invitation extended to Cuba.    The conference, originally scheduled for the end of March,  was postponed by the Costa Rican Foreign Ministry until April,  at the request of the Caribbean countries, which claimed they  had problems with their ministers' agendas.    Concerning Robaina's possible visit to Spain, the diplomatic  source said it could occur in May. However, he said the exact  date must be adjusted by the two countries' foreign ministries.  The source reported the chief of Cuban diplomacy plans to tour  Central America during the first half of April, but the details  and itinerary have yet to be defined.</p>

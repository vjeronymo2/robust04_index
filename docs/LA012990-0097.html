			<p><P> January 29, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> DEMOCRATS EXPECT HOT DEBATE; HOLLINGS CALLS BUDGET 'FRAUD'  </P> <P> President Bush's $1.23-trillion budget drew a skeptical response from several  Democrats in Congress today with one senator describing it as "another fraud"  and a House leader calling for scaling back the President's defense proposals.  </P> <P> While Democrats who control both houses of Congress were careful not to dismiss  the budget out of hand -- in past years they had often characterized Reagan  Administration budgets as "dead on arrival" -- they predicted a brutal debate  over spending priorities.  </P> <P> "They continue to jimmy the figures," Sen. Ernest F. Hollings (D-S.C.), a  high-ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee, said of the Bush proposal.  "It's another fraud."  </P> <P> "I think it's a stand-pat budget. I don't think it's a budget that really meets  our needs," said House Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri.  </P> <P> House Speaker Thomas S. Foley of Washington emerged from a White House meeting  and immediately predicted a "larger reduction" in defense spending than Bush  has proposed.  </P> <P> "There'll be a debate about defense; there's no question about that," said  Foley, making note of the changes under way in Eastern Europe that would allow  the United States to scale back its military presence.  </P></p>

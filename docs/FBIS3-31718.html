			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Civic Democratic Alliance [ODA] rejects the  attempts to change the Constitution of the Czech Republic that  were made earlier this week at the meeting of the Chamber of  Deputies. ODA Deputy Chairman Daniel Kroupa spoke about this  today.    [Begin Kroupa recording] The ODA rejects these attacks  against our Constitution and considers it fundamental to ask if  all parties voting for the Constitution feel committed to defend  it against attacks by extremist forces. We think that the  attempt to remove the Senate from the Constitution and  incorporate into it elements of direct democracy are aimed at  creating favorable conditions for these extremist forces taking  power.    In this respect, I wish to comment on the matter of  referenda. You all know well that the ODA has consistently  opposed this institution, pointing out that it disturbs our  constitutional balance of power. Just now, when our parliament  is debating the proposal of introducing referenda into our  Constitution, in Slovakia the referendum might be used to take  away the citizens' right to elect. This in fact is the substance  of Mr. Meciar's proposal to strip disobedient deputies of their  mandate by means of a referendum. It is an almost classical  illustration of how direct democracy can be used as an  instrument to liquidate democracy as such. [end recording]</p>

			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / IADB to play wider role in Latin America THE InterAmerican Development Bank closed its annual meeting in Hamburg yesterday with every prospect of an expanded role in Latin America during the 1990s. Government shareholders from the Americas and outside the region gave broad support to a rise in the bank's capital. A Dollars 22.5bn increase in capital agreed in 1989 runs out at the end of this year, and negotiations are expected over the rest of this year about a further increase. Yet it was also clear that the IADB's role is expected to change. It is likely to focus more on the private sector following privatisation in much of Latin America and governments' increased reliance on the private sector for infrastructure development. The bank does not lend directly to the private sector at present. Some shareholders suggested that 5-10 per cent of its capital should be devoted to private sector infrastructure lending. In total, about half of its lending will go on infrastructure, the quality of which deteriorated badly in the 1980s. Further effort by the bank in social sectors was called for, notably poverty alleviation, health and education. The US also urged the bank to help moves towards 'good government', such as improving the judicial system. According to Mr Enrique Iglesias, IADB president, discussion about a capital increase centred on a figure of Dollars 30bn-Dollars 40bn. This would allow the bank to continue to lend at the current Dollars 7bn-a-year rate. Talks on capital replenishment resume in May in Montevideo, when the thorny issue of increasing the shareholding of the bank's government shareholders from outside the region will first be confronted. An increased non-regional share means the US will have to cut its stake in the bank, something it has strongly opposed. The Peruvian minister of finance, Mr Jorge Camet, said talks with commercial banks expected to begin in June over a debt restructuring would explore ways of using foreign debt as a means of payment for the privatisation of large state-owned assets. The government expected to privatise some 40 companies of this year, he said.</p>

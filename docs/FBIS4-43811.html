			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Finance Minister Theo Waigel by </F> Editor in Chief Rainer Nahrendorf; place and date not given:  "Setting a Fixed Date for the Abolition of the Solidarity  Surcharge Would Lack Sense"]    [Text] Duesseldorf -- As Finance Minister Theo Waigel said  in an interview with HANDELSBLATT, it is true that strong  economic growth is yielding more money for the state's coffers,  but the amount is still not as much as was envisaged under the  original financial plan for 1995. The new taxation estimate,  which is based on a 3.9-percent nominal growth this year and 4.4  percent in 1995, will result in a budget deficit of between 9  and 10 billion German marks [DM] compared to May 1993 estimates.  The deficit is primarily the result of the 1993 recession.    It must now be included in the 1995 budget and compensated  for by revenue from privatization, the continuation of overall  spending cuts, savings in expenditure on personnel based on  moderate wage settlements in 1994, strict adherence to the  expenditure moratorium, as well as the consistent pursuit of a  consolidation course.    Strong economic growth will not release the federal  authorities from the obligation of having to consolidate the  budget. As of 1995, the fund for the repayment of inherited  debt as well as taking over the debts of the federal and former  GDR railroads will present enormous challenges. The liabilities  stemming from taking over Trust Agency debts have been taken  into account in the budget plans for 1995. Waigel does not  envisage any other risks.    Expenditure on interest rates and liabilities in the social  services field make a strict continuation of the consolidation  course imperative.  <H5>  Debt </H5>   Waigel rejects the constant accusations that he is solely  responsible for the debts of DM2 trillion. It is going too far  to burden him with the laender and municipal authority debts  totaling DM600 billion. The same applies to the DM300 billion  debt that already existed in 1982 toward the end of the  socialist-liberal coalition and was transferred to Finance  Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg. Waigel said: "And I am not  ashamed of the DM600 billion of state debt prompted by German  unity."    To reduce the high level of taxation and state expenditure,  it is necessary to keep the increase in the budget below the  nominal GDP growth rate. In Waigel's opinion, this goal must be  pursued over the entire upcoming parliamentary term. The 1994  federal budget has already resulted in nominal reductions for a  whole series of individual budgets. This will continue in a  similar form in the 1995 budget.    Only a strict consolidation course will result in a  reduction  in the net borrowing. This is not only necessary to fulfill the  Maastricht Treaty criteria, but also in view of interest rate  trends on the capital markets. No other expenditure programs  would be possible. Waigel said: "If a new expenditure priority  appears in one place, then is must be compensated for by  financing elsewhere." The government has been successful over  the past few years with this principle, and it must continue to  adhere to it.    The principle also applies in the case of formulating the  joint CDU/CSU [Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social  Union] election program. The proviso attached to all the points  contained in the program is the availability of finance. After  1995, the highest priority is the use of all possible room for  maneuver to reduce taxes and ancillary wage costs. Higher  taxation must be accepted over a certain period of time, because  of the historic event of unification. However, this should not  be some kind of permanent state of affairs, or the growth that  has been achieved will be lost.  Solidarity Surcharge    If the liberals want the solidarity surcharge to be limited  to a set period of time, then they are calling for more than is  possible in economic terms at the present time. Waigel gave  assurances that he wants to do something about income tax rates  and then about the solidarity surcharge. He said he was in  favor of an annual review of the solidarity surcharge and a  reduction as soon as that is possible. However, it would be  unrealistic to set a date for canceling the solidarity  surcharge, which will be collected as of 1 January 1995. The  revenue from the solidarity surcharge will be necessary to  service the fund for the repayment of inherited debt to the tune  of almost DM40 billion.    Waigel warned against reducing the taxation burden at the  price of increasing the net borrowing. This would prompt  negative reactions from the markets and possibly from the  Bundesbank, too. Frankly, if higher interest rates were the  result, that would be a disaster.    The example of the United States, which lowered taxes in the  hope of achieving higher revenues, is instructive. It did  indeed lead to an improvement in the economy, but also to an  enormous budget deficit at the same time. In any event, Waigel  does not underestimate the value of tax cuts as a means of  introducing dynamism into the economy. The economy is  influenced by medium-term goals and psychology.    That is why the fixed period consolidation course undertaken  by the coalition was so important. The coalition started  pursuing consolidation in the recession and was now accelerating  it through the federal consolidation package and the savings,  consolidation, and growth package. Waigel pointed out that the  capital markets had been relieved of quite a burden as a result  of consolidation and the introduction of the solidarity  surcharge as of 1995. This has made it easier for the  Bundesbank to make decisions and has led to the relatively low  interest rates. Medium-term tax cuts are also part of this  long-term orientation.    In the future, the Bundesbank will also continue to pursue  a taxation policy oriented toward growth, performance, the  family, and medium-size businesses. Apart from continuing with  the tax-free status of the minimum wage within the framework of  a system of taxes based on performance and the simplification of  taxation, a further focus of attention will be an improvement in  the general conditions under which companies operate and thus in  the framework conditions for jobs. Waigel includes among these  points a reduction in corporate tax, the exemption of the tax on  nonrevenue wealth in the new laender beyond 1995, as well as the  principle of transferring to the country of origin the levying  of value-added tax in the European Union [EU]. The introduction  of this principle will mean that deliveries of goods within the  community will essentially be treated as domestic deliveries.  <H5>  Taxation Rates </H5>   The reduction in corporate tax within the framework of the  law on safeguarding Germany's future as a center for business as  well as lowering the taxation of income from business activity  to 47 percent were considerable successes, said Waigel. He  conceded that this differentiation of taxation rates was not  attractive from the viewpoint of the overall taxation system.  However, in view of the reductions in the transfer payments to  the eastern laender that were instituted at the same time, it  would not have been acceptable for big earners in show business,  sports, and politics to pay less tax.    The tax relief on savings for medium-size businesses has not  been pursued by the SPD [Social Democratic Party of Germany] as  Oskar Lafontaine told HANDELSBLATT (the issue of 10-11 June  1994). In fact, during the mediation process on safeguarding  Germany's future as a center for business, the SPD did more to  prevent the introduction of the tax relief on savings on 1  January 1994. It will not come into force until 1 January 1995.    In its taxation and budget policies, the coalition  government  has always sought to maintain a social balance. The solidarity  surcharge will preserve that balance. Until now, the costs of  German unity have to a large extent been borne by so-called  "better earners." The "better earners" have been wrongly drawn  into a discussion that is wrong. Waigel said: "I have not seen  any signs of a lack of justice." Waigel pointed to the  progressive taxation rates and the increase in the tax on  private wealth. If one looks at the solidarity surcharge rates  for earners of low, medium, and high incomes, then one can see  that a social balance has also been retained in this area.    The abolition of the solidarity surcharge called for by the  SPD and its replacement by a 10-percent supplementary charge for  gross incomes above DM60,000/DM120,000 (single/married) would  impose a further burden on self-employed higher earners and  would thus be counterproductive.    Waigel asked at what level the incomes of better earners  really start. If one takes the figures given by Mr. Scharping,  namely, an income of DM50,000 for single people, one is already  in the average-income bracket. If one considers Scharping's  statement to a French newspaper on how the supplementary charge  is to provide as much revenue as the solidarity surcharge, it  would have to already apply to gross incomes above DM44,000 in  the case of single people and DM88,000 in the case of married  couples. In net terms, that is, after the deduction of all  taxes and dues, it would mean about DM2,300 in the case of  single people.    If one wanted to excuse 80 percent of taxpayers, then there  would be a budget shortfall of about DM7.5 billion. That is why  SPD demands for a supplementary charge are lacking sense in  fiscal terms. The SPD's fiscal and tax policies have made the  party lose credibility and that rebounded on it at the elections  last Sunday [12 June]. Waigel pointed out that the solidarity  surcharge had been approved with votes from laender governed by  the SPD.  <H5>  Valuation Rates </H5>   On the question of inheritance and wealth taxes, Waigel said  he wanted to wait to see what the Federal Constitutional Court's  position is on valuation criteria. Essentially, he considers it  right to retain a form of revenue-based taxation and not to  introduce valuation criteria based on market rates. If the  Federal Constitutional Court decides that the 1964 valuation  criteria are no longer valid, it might also be possible to  achieve a settlement in keeping with the constitution using  differentiated surcharges. However, the federal authorities,  laender, and municipalities should not attempt to obtain higher  revenues through new criteria for the valuation of land holdings.    In Waigel's opinion, a carbon dioxide energy tax should  impose a further burden on the economy. He said that the  conditions for the introduction of a carbon dioxide energy tax  were that taxes would not be raised, that there would be  competitive neutrality, which means that Germany should not  introduce such a tax by itself, and that it could be used to  direct a specific ecological course, that is to say, no forms of  energy containing carbon dioxide should be exempted.  <H5>  Taxation of Interest </H5>   Waigel stressed that the harmonization of interest rate  taxation in Europe would be a main focus of attention for the  German EU presidency, which begins on 1 July of this year. Now  that a liberalization of the movement of capital within the EU  has been achieved, it must be ensured that no new competitive  inequalities arise as a result of the differences in the  taxation of revenue from capital assets. Different systems are  used within the EU; in some countries there are notification  systems and in others taxation at source.    Waigel is seeking a settlement based on the principle of  subsidiarity, a settlement that would essentially leave each  country's national taxation system untouched, but would, at the  same time, make it impossible to evade the obligation to pay  tax. This does not amount to trying to square a circle, but can  easily be achieved. Member states that have a notification  system would be able to retain it and place such information at  the disposal of member states with a deduction of tax system.  On the other hand, countries using a system based on the  deduction of tax must ensure that deductions are also made in  the case of EU foreigners. Waigel said that he did not think  that off-shore places such as the Channel Islands posed a great  problem.</p>

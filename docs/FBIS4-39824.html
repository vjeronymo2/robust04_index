			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Kazakhstan President Nursultan Nazarbayev by </F> Vitaliy Portnikov in the "Leader" column: "Nursultan  Nazarbayev: `There Is No Need To Look for What Is Not There.'  The Kazakhstan President Wants To Remember Only the Good  Things" -- place, date not given]    [Excerpts] [Portnikov] Nursultan Abishevich, the full  text of your project on creating a Eurasian union has been  published. Has there been any initial response to this document,  and, generally, what sort of response do you expect knowing the  reaction that your initiative has provoked?    [Nazarbayev] There has been some reaction from the  international democratic movement in Russia. Mr. Smirnov,  organizing committee chairman, sent a cable advising that on 18  June a special forum will be held in support of this  undertaking. Today there was a phone call from Sergey Shakhray  who congratulated me, saying that he had read the full text in  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA: Thanks to NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA for that. He  fully approves of the text of this project and proposes to hold  a special conference on the 14th that will be attended by  leading politicians of Russia, including leaders of the Federal  Assembly. My deputy chief of staff and the deputy premier in  charge of these matters will go there. Prior to this there was a  conversation with Eduard Shevardnadze, to whom I had earlier  sent the document, and he stated his support. This seems to be  all so far but still not much time has passed; some people  thought that I just made an impromptu statement in Moscow  speaking before chief editors in Moscow University. But in  fact, this is an idea I have been contemplating for a long time.  No one can be content with the CIS that we have today. Some  400 documents that are not being implemented. I am not saying  that the CIS is not serving its purpose and that it must be  disbanded. It must be good to have something rather than  nothing. But the CIS is moving in one direction, and life in  another. Now there are 65 posts on the border between Russia  and Kazakhstan which look very much like border checkpoints, not  customs houses, and I want to issue an edict unilaterally  removing all customs barriers in the direction of Russia. I  propose to put in place normal supra-national coordinating  bodies. There should be no fear that sovereignty will be lost,  and so forth. It is generally believed that common sovereignty  is superior to each separate sovereignty of a particular state,  and that it is more useful. If there is a Eurasian Union  Executive Committee empowered to oversee the implementation of  our documents; if there is a body empowered to apply sanctions  for failure to observe an accord; if there is a real common  economic space; and if we lift customs barriers, multinational  companies and joint ventures will emerge, and producers will  find their own way around. It is only essential not to choke  off this way to them. [passage omitted]    [Portnikov] After your meeting in Ashkhabad [Ashgabat] with  Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk and then after your official  visit to Kiev; following your meeting in Ashkhabad with Eduard  Shevardnadze, and then after your contacts with him in Moscow,  some observers and politicians got the impression that a new  axis of states, as it were, is being created, setting themselves  somewhat against the growing influence and pressure from Russia.  On the other hand, there are your contacts with your Central  Asian colleagues. Regional integration here is also perceived  in Russia as an alternative to the processes under way in the  CIS and around Russia. To what extent do you think this  perception is correct?    [Nazarbayev] I know about such talk. Some time ago the  question of a Baltic-Black Sea belt was aired very broadly. I  would like to say that Kazakhstan must never, and will never,  engage in any intrigues against Russia. This does not respond  to its historic or strategic interests. These interests are  that Kazakhstan should have a friendly, close relationship with  Russia, based on mutual trust. This is a strategic goal. None  of us here has any objection when, say, Boris Yeltsin begins to  work with Poland and Germany and a certain belt is being created  there. As far as concerns our efforts, jointly with Uzbekistan  and Kirgizia [Kyrgyzstan], to create a single market space,  lifting all customs barriers (people are only grateful to us for  that), we are thus setting a good example. And, to avert any  talk to the effect that we are forming a certain belt, let us  form a Eurasian union. This is an open and fair proposition.    [Portnikov] You seem to have pretty good contacts with  Ukraine, and still it is obviously not a candidate for the  Eurasian Union....    [Nazarbayev] If someone does not get into the Eurasian  Union, this does not mean that we should not have a good  relationship with that party. We have extensive economic  contacts with Ukraine. We have an extensive economic interest  there. And they too have a big interest in Kazakhstan. There  is a similar interest on the part of other countries, and we are  developing trade relations with Iran; our trade with Turkey is  growing fast; and our trade with China has grown 250 times in  two and a half years. Therefore I want to state quite  unequivocally: It is wrong to suppose that Nazarbayev,  Kazakhstan, seeks to create some bloc, one not very friendly  toward Russia. This will not happen; one should not look for  what is not there. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Volodymyr Chikalin: "Nobody Can Prohibit Loving </F> Ukraine"]    [Text] As has already been reported, the fifth congress of  the Ukrainian Officers' Union [SOU] has taken place. Some  observers predicted it could be the last congress, however,  similar forecasts were voiced prior to all the previous  congresses. As Mykola Rerikh once said: "The loftier the idea,  the more dogs bark at it."    The fifth congress, unlike previous ones, was held in an  everyday atmosphere which is understood, because the Army, like  the rest of society is living through hard times. When times  get hard, people concentrate on the most acute problems.    The Ministry of Defense leadership did not attend the  conference, which demonstrated its attitude toward the SOU. On  the eve of the congress, the ministry discussed whether  delegates should be permitted to arrive in Kiev. However, some  commanders had concealed the cable with the permission to hold  the congress and a group of deputies failed to show up. Those  who arrived said: "Banning the SOU is like banning love for  Ukraine." When I was listening to their speeches, I became more  and more assured that the strengthening of the national Armed  Forces had become the primary goal in these people's lives.    The union is currently being blamed for involvement in  political activities. However, is it not politics to implement  the national policy of safeguarding Ukraine's security? Or why  not grant officers a right to express their opinions regarding  reform in the Army? Yet, the military command believes that  every serviceman can only express opinions regarding his post.  Thus, a squad commander can only speak on behalf of his squad  and not meddle in the company's affairs. Those officers  refusing to live in accordance with the  cobbler-should-stick-to-his-last principle are risking the lose  of their posts and ranks. This information was made public at  the congress -- Colonel Serhiy Dudko was relieved of duty for  sending a report on embezzlements of military property to a  local newspaper. Even generals are being persecuted for  "dissidence." Not long ago, General Major Oleksandr Rol, deputy  chief of staff of the Ukrainian Air Force, expressed his  viewpoint on reform of the Air Force speaking to a VECHIRNIY  KYYIV correspondent. For this, he fell into the Staff's and  Council of Ministers' disgrace. Persecution of "dissidents" is  under way at all levels.    I met a former colleague of mine who is now a military  reporter, and he said: "When I visit a military unit and people  learn that I am a reporter, they run away from me."    Not all the officers put up with this kind of mentality  prohibiting independent thinking. Speaking at the congress, SOU  Deputy Chief Hryhoriy Omelchenko said: "We must leave this  conference hall having relieved ourselves from our slave  mentality. Without this, one cannot be a genuine patriot."    The congress demonstrated that not all the members of the  union withstood the test. Some people backed out after  abandoning hope of resolving social problems, others simply got  scared in the face of reactionary command's attack. There was  not a single regiment, battalion, or similar level commander  among the delegates. Delivering a revision committee's report,  Volodymyr Tymofeyev pointed out that the number of retired  officers in the union is twice as large as that of active ones.  Retired officers are even chairmen of some oblast  organizations. When the union was being formed that situation  was easy to account for -- people had nothing to lose. However,  when the union was registered and entered the history of the  Ukrainian Armed Forces as one of the most active forces  supporting their development, a decrease in the number of union  members gives ground for thought. I have already named some of  the causes of the situation, but some demand separate  consideration. Among SOU members, 85 percent are represented by  Ukrainians, while the number of Ukrainians in the Armed Forces  is much smaller. This is why delegates discussed the issue of  reviewing personnel policy. Colonel Tsymbalyuk and Captain  Second Rank Khryshchuk emphasized that the command is trying to  ban SOU representatives from working in certification  committees. The same opinions were voiced in the speech by Rukh  Chairman Vyacheslav Chornovil, who added that without reforming  personnel policy we cannot build a national army capable of  guaranteeing Ukraine's independence.    Deputy Defense Minister Volodymyr Mulyava also spoke on  working under new conditions. He called upon delegates to  expand SOU's influence in all spheres of Army life. In his  opinion, in the future the union should be transformed into a  general association of officers and noncommissioned officers.    The words "concrete measures" were not used at the first  four  congresses, because at that time, a program was being drafted.  Not abandoning this line, the fifth congress paid more  attention to resolving current problems, in particular, the  union members' image as a model in combat training and social  activities. Colonel Tretetskyy, chief of a unit's psychological  service, said in this respect: "We used to have 17 officers in  our organization; only 12 are left today, but they are real  fighters for the cause of building Ukraine's Armed Forces. We  are determined to serve as a model for others to follow. This  opinion found its reflection in the resolution of the congress.    Today, when our Army is experiencing hard times, officers'  personal examples play a very significant role. Here are a  couple of examples demonstrating how difficult it is for the  military to perform their functions. The Army receives only 33  percent of necessary financing and even lacks money to pay  servicemen's wages in timely fashion. Thus, it is no wonder  that the Defense Ministry has recently bought only one T-80 tank  produced in Kharkov. Shortages of fuel and spare parts have had  a negative impact on training of airmen and led to the  resignation of 170 young pilots. However, it takes a lot of  determination to unselfishly serve the motherland in these  conditions. The fact that the union appealed for personal  examples means that the organization will see better times. The  more difficult the situation in the Army, the higher its rating  among the people. Today, 62.5 percent of Ukrainians have  confidence in the officers' corps, while among farmers this  figure reaches 83 percent. The people rely on its defenders for  the protection of their most cherished values--freedom and  independence. This gives the Army strength and inspiration.</p>

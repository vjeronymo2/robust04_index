			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / GM chief urges compromise to spur trade talks Mr John Smith, president of General Motors, yesterday called for compromise in the stalled trade talks between the US and Japan, which he said were causing uncertainty in the foreign exchange markets. 'Somewhere along the line we need to reach some form of compromise to take these trade talks forward,' Mr Smith said in Tokyo. His comments came as US and Japanese trade negotiators failed in talks this week to agree on how foreign access to Japan's vehicle and parts markets could be improved. The chief executive of the world's largest carmaker noted that the framework trade negotiations were important in helping foreign companies make progress in Japan but added that 'the strengthening of the yen against the dollar has done more to level the trade playing field between Japanese and US companies than all of the rhetoric and policy initiatives of the previous 20 years'. Mr Smith warned that 'the fact that the US-Japan trade imbalance has deteriorated despite the high-profile diplomatic talks. . . has not gone unnoticed by the Congress and the public'. Consequently, 'if Japan fails to open its markets more, then I believe the yen will continue to strengthen to the detriment of Japanese exporters'. GM had benefited significantly from the yen's sharp appreciation, Mr Smith indicated. The company has seen component sales to Japanese companies, for example, rise substantially over the past year and expects in four years to double its 1993 sales to Japanese companies of Dollars 800m (Pounds 512m). GM also saw a 27 per cent increase in sales of cars and trucks in Japan in the first six months of this year, to 17,400 units, of which about 8,000 units were made in North America. This compares with 31,958 units for the whole of last year.</p>

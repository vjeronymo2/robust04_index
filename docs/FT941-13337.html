			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Pressures different in a small company Sir, Mr Grant-Wilson (Letters, January 22), commenting on Peter Bonfield's Personal View (January 19), is, I think, a little out with his statement that 'very few successful chief executives in business operate with more than 10 direct reports'. The vast bulk of senior executives in business are, of course, running small businesses, not uncommonly large ones like Mr Bonfield's Fujitsu subsidiary, ICL. The great majority of these are owner-proprietors, sole traders or lone directors of their own limited companies. With varying degrees of equanimity, such senior executives operate with many more than 10 'direct reports': sales prospect contacts, customers, bank managers, VAT inspectors, trading standards officers, solicitors, accountants, direct employees, subcontractors, taxmen, customer accounts departments (chasing payments in), creditors (postponing payments out), suppliers (chasing delivery), advertising, office equipment/supplies, computer and telecoms salesmen, 'red tape' government departments, journalists, etc. I estimate this to be at least 60 different 'directs' to/from whom the small business executive must 'report' in any week. If the FT were to run more 'If I were a government minister . . .' Personal Views, it might be a good idea to ask those running small businesses to contribute, rather than relatively unrepresentative, and unpressurised, big-company senior executives. The paucity of the latter's 'direct reports' must make the average business director/proprietor wonder what they do all day. Then again, the small businessman's spouse would doubtless be even more amazed. Any housewife - sorry, house-spouse - must surely have to consider, decide on and operate with more 'direct reports' in any normal weekday morning than the prime minister or any (large or small) business executive copes with in a week. Come to think of it, weren't the management techniques of those responsible for housekeeping the basis for the brand of 'UK Ltd' management promoted by Baroness T?

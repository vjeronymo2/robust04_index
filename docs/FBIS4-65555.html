			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Judith Waintraub: "Rocard the Victim of Unfair </F> Competition"]    [Text] Although Philippe de Villiers' candidacy the  European election may prevent the Right from being cut off from  its anti-European electorate, the multiplication of lists on the  Left follows a rationale of pure competition. The division of  roles is being carried out at the expense of the Socialists, who  are not managing to find their role in the campaign.    Thanks to the slogan dreamed up by Jacques Seguela --  "Europe, yes, but with solidarity" -- the Socialist Party [PSF]  hoped to reconcile what is irreconcilable: loyalty to the  historical ideal of the Left and rejection of the reality of a  Community which this same Left has largely helped to construct.  The Socialists' aim was to win forgiveness for Maastricht  without repudiating their convictions, arouse enthusiasm while  integrating the Euro-skepticism of a large section of their  electorate, and to promise to repaint the liberal Europe of  business in Socialist colors. This is a difficult task which  the multiplication of lists has gradually turned into an  impossibility for Michel Rocard.    And yet, the PSF first secretary tried to protect himself  against dangers of which he was fully aware. He took on the  role of prophet of doom, in keeping with his natural vocation.  His is a role of realism and critical statements. Bernard  Kouchner [former Socialist minister] has the role of dreamer.  The most famous of the "French doctors" was to give the  Socialist list a historical dimension. The intellectuals' plot  hatched by Bernard- Henri Levy is likely to deprive the PSF of  this breath of fresh air. The indignation expressed yesterday by  Jean Glavany, its spokesman, bears witness to the painful shock  felt by the Socialists who thought they were protected from such  an outrage.    Of course, the humanitarian card is not out of date.  Bernard- Henri Levy, even with the backing of Andre Glucksmann  and Edgar Morin [French philosophers], is still less credible  than the former minister [Kouchner]. If only he were there to  provide his own defense. At Rue de Solferino [PSF  headquarters], they hope that Bernard Kouchner will return from  Rwanda quickly enough to meet urgent electoral needs and deter  his intellectual friends from carrying out their evil plan.    This position must be held. This is all the more vital for  the Socialists, because they face competition on all other  fronts. Michel Rocard's efforts to rally the Left's  anti-Europeans have not enabled him to drown the deafening  statements of his rivals. The prime minister, who tried to  inaugurate his reign behind the scenes, wanted to launch the  European election campaign in the poorest districts.    Unfortunately, the working class voters only have eyes for  Bernard Tapie! He does not bother with speeches on Europe. He  talks to "the people," as Rocard likes to say, about what  interests them, and the first secretary cannot even fight him  face-to-face. Francois Mitterrand would be offended and Jack  Lang [former Socialist minister] would certainly make that known.    Michel Rocard cannot even give in to systematic opposition.  The "other policy" is represented by Jean-Pierre Chevenement  [former Socialist minister] or the Communist Party: left-wing  voters are spoiled for choice. And, above all, the tone of  protest does not suit the advocate of "telling the truth," be it  on Europe or anything else. You cannot change who you are.</p>

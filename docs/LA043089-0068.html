			<p><P> April 30, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> AFRICA FACES ALARMING NEW PARADOX: RECORD HARVESTS, RECORD HUNGER  </P> <P> Much of Africa will have above average or even record harvests this year, as it  did last year. But many Africans are still going hungry.  </P> <P> The surge in food production, due chiefly to improved weather conditions,  highlights what one World Bank official describes as the paradox of "full  silos, empty stomachs."  </P> <P> Big harvests are not helping poorly paid or jobless city residents who cannot  afford to buy enough food, even if prices fall slightly. And in rural areas,  many small farmers who cannot grow enough for their families lack the money to  buy extra food.  </P> <P> Thus, even as many experts seek ways to further boost Africa's food production,  a smaller number are looking for ways to boost incomes to help the hungry poor  afford decent diets.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Consumption Declining  </P> <P> According to the World Bank, nearly one-fourth of Africa's population -- more  than 100 million people -- do not get enough to eat. Food consumption per  person has been declining for most Africans since 1980, the bank says.  </P> <P> Large-scale famine continues in southern Sudan, due to a five-year civil war.  War also hampers farm production in at least three other countries -- Angola,  Mozambique, and Ethiopia.  </P> <P> But elsewhere, "The basic part of hunger (in Africa) is an income problem,"  says G. Edward Schuh, a former economic aide to Presidents Gerald R. Ford and  Jimmy Carter, and ex-World Bank director of agriculture and rural development.  "It's basically a poverty problem."  </P> <P> There is a growing recognition among experts of a poverty-hunger link. In a  recent issue of the publication Africa Report, World Bank vice-president for  Africa, Edward Jaycox, said: "Hunger is not mainly caused by transitory  droughts or crop failures or interruptions in the market. . . . Rather, chronic  food insecurity is caused by poverty. . . . "  </P> <P> </P> <P> Income Declining  </P> <P> Per capita income has been declining in Africa for several decades, falling by  25% since 1980, Jaycox says.  </P> <P> "We cannot treat the hunger problem as (only) a food supply problem," says  Sholom Reutlinger, a World Bank official.  </P> <P> World Bank President Barber Conable has called for more efforts to help the  poor afford more food. But for now, most World Bank and other aid efforts  remain directed at boosting food production rather than income.  </P> <P> Diverting more international and African attention to incomes will not be easy,  Reutlinger says. Larger farmers and equipment manufacturers push to keep the  focus on increasing crop production. And donors and African bureaucracies are  long accustomed to such a focus, he says.  </P> <P> Reutlinger and other specialists interviewed support efforts to boost food  production. But, they say, with the improved harvests, now is a good time to  try harder to find ways to help more people afford the food already available  in their countries.  </P> <P> </P> <P> New Programs Urged  </P> <P> They call for such programs as:  </P> <P> * Hiring small farmers in the off-season to build rural roads and bridges and  paying them with vouchers that can be exchanged for food.  </P> <P> Malawi has begun such a program, and the World Bank is considering helping fund  it. If such programs are not run during the slack farming season, however, they  may pull farmers away from regular farm work, one expert says.  </P> <P> *Paying rural children with food for each week of school they attend.  </P> <P> This would help many families by reducing their expenses on food, and would  encourage school attendance, says Schuh, now dean of the Humphrey Institute of  Public Affairs at the University of Minnesota. A few programs like this have  been launched in schools in India, but he is not aware of any in Africa, Schuh  says.  </P> <P> Schuh says the more common types of aid to farmers also help feed the poor. For  example, assisting export-crop farmers through government programs such as  credit and improved roads often leads to their hiring more labor, giving the  laborers more income.  </P> <P> And government aid to farmers growing staple food crops also helps the poor by  reducing food prices, he adds.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Inadequate Storage  </P> <P> The challenge in Africa this year is what to do with the bumper crops already  in or expected. Storage facilities in most countries are inadequate.  </P> <P> Where storage is available, Reutlinger suggests that the local governments buy  the surplus and use it to pay for work projects carried out by the poor.  </P> <P> Dean Schuh says countries should export what they cannot use or sell, and save  the foreign exchange that is earned to import food during lean years.  Cumbersome as that may sound, it would avoid losses of food in storage to  rodents and insects, he says.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Potential for Growth  </P> <P> Africa has the potential to produce enough food for its people, says Curtis  Farrar, a World Bank expert on agriculture.  </P> <P> And although he acknowledges that a continuing high population growth rate --  Africa's is the highest in the world -- could offset production increases,  Farrar says the growth rate is almost certain to slow. It will slow as incomes  and education rise along with urbanization and couples have fewer children.  </P> <P> Some experts are not so optimistic. Family planning programs in Africa have  made some progress but no major gains so far.  </P> <P> Farrar is executive secretary of the World Bank's Consultative Group on  International Agricultural Research, which has several research centers in  Africa.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Dominant Crop  </P> <P> No "green revolution" is likely to happen in Africa the way it did in Asia in  the 1960s, Farrar says. Africa lacks the kind of single dominant crop that Asia  (rice) had, he explains.  </P> <P> But some crops are showing major potential. Sorghum production has doubled in  some parts in recent years, and has more potential. Local crops such as cow  peas are also showing significant promise, he says.  </P> <P> Improved corn seed has tripled yields in Ghana, Zimbabwe, and Kenya, says  Michael Cowlinson, a social scientist at CGIAR headquarters in Washington. Such  increases have been accompanied by more effective use of fertilizers, better  planting methods, and local research, he says.  </P> <P> But Farrar and Cowlinson point to a weak link in efforts to boost food  production: In most of Africa, long-range research is inadequate. They also  cite lack of focus and coordination among donor nations aiding agricultural  production efforts.  </P></p>

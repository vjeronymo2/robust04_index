			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / Christopher hails Mideast accords 'The Arab-Israeli conflict, one of the most long-standing and most intractable conflicts of this entire century, is drawing to an end,' Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, said triumphantly yesterday after he met Israeli leaders on the first day of a Middle East shuttle. Mr Christopher's optimism reflected the rapid pace of the Middle East peace process as Israel and Jordan opened their first talks in the region yesterday, marking the beginning of a week of intense US-Arab-Israeli diplomatic activity. The Israel-Jordan negotiations came as Israeli and Palestinian delegates opened a new round of talks in Cairo and Mr Christopher arrived in the region for meetings with the leaders of Israel, Jordan, Syria and Egypt. Mr Christopher will shuttle among Middle East capitals seeking to further Israeli-Syrian peace process, start talks on economic co-operation and regional integration and prepare for next Monday's summit in Washington between King Hussein of Jordan and Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli prime minister. The optimism may prove to be misplaced in a region which has often defied prediction and has been in a state of war for almost half a century. However, Jordanian and Israeli delegates who opened talks in a tent in the Arava desert yesterday said they had had a 'very fruitful' day and expected to announce results today, particulalry on one of the key issues - demarcation of the disputed border. Both sides said there were difficult obstacles to overcome but said they were determined to reach solutions to the other two issues - water resources and security - and finalise them in a treaty of peace. 'The prospects for peace are good,' said Mr Elyakim Rubinstein, head of the Israeli delegation. The bilateral talks conclude tomorrow and the process moves to the Jordanian side of the Dead Sea where Israel, Jordan and the US are to discuss economic projects such as regional tourism, connecting electricity grids and perhaps a transnational oil and gas pipeline. The US, expected to fund many of these projects, is considering paving a road between Israel and Jordan via Eilat. Mr Shimon Peres, Israeli foreign minister, who on Wednesday will become the highest Israeli official ever to visit Jordan publicly, said yesterday: 'The main point is this peace will create unprecedented economic opportunities.' Mr Peres also said Israel and the Palestinians were determined to press ahead with peace efforts despite Sunday's bloody clashes in the Gaza Strip. 'There's always a place for fear and there's always a place for regret but that won't take away the necessity to go forward,' he told Israel radio. The Israeli-Syrian track has been deadlocked for nearly three years over the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights but Israel recently accepted Syrian sovereignty over the area.</p>

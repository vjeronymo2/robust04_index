			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: MPs urge same deal for pools as lottery THE national heritage select committee yesterday appealed to the government to ensure that football pools and the new national lottery would operate 'on a level playing field'. The committee rejected the arguments of Mr Peter Brooke, the national heritage secretary, that football pools were a game of skill rather than effectively a lottery and therefore not entitled to similar treatment. The committee recommended that the lottery, which will have a top prize of more than Pounds 1m a week, and the pools be treated equally in the way they are marketed and sold. The pools, for example, should gain the right to advertise on television, to market their products in the same way as the lottery and to roll up jackpots from one week to the next - at the moment all prize money has to be distributed in the week it is received. The committee, chaired by Mr Gerald Kaufman, Labour MP for Manchester Gorton, said 90 per cent of pools players used the same numbers every week, so that the pools were in effect a lottery rather than a game of skill. 'In the committee's view the similarities between the pools and the national lottery are substantial. It is essential that the two should operate on a level playing field.' Mr Malcolm Hughes, managing director of Vernons pools, welcomed the report. He said he hoped the government would take note of what both supporters and opponents were saying. The committee recommended that the headquarters of the Office of the National Lottery be located in the Liverpool area because that was where job losses in the pools industry would hit hardest. The MPs said it was 'imperative' that the money allocated from the lottery to the arts, heritage, sport, charities, and the millenium fund for projects marking the year 2000, should not be regarded as substitutes for public funding. It said it would also like the National Heritage Department to monitor the possible impact of the lottery on charities to make sure they did not lose out overall. The second reading of the National Lottery Bill is scheduled for Monday. Mr Brooke said when he published the bill that about Pounds 1.5bn tickets could be bought each year, generating Pounds 14m of prizes each week and about Pounds 350m a year for good causes.</p>

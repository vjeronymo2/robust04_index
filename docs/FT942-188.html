			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / Covent Garden's 18-year drama: Developments at the Royal Opera House which have attracted criticism High above the stage at the Royal Opera House in London's Covent Garden, technicians tread carefully around tangles of ropes, lights and cables in the fly gallery, where systems for lifting scenery on and off the stage are co-ordinated. A lot of the equipment has been operating since 1901. 'Bits and pieces are cobbled together all the time to keep us running,' said Mr John Payne, head of external affairs for the ROH development office. For the past 18 years, the opera house has been trying to secure public funding and planning permission to modernise its facilities. Tonight the opera house's latest redevelopment scheme - an estimated Pounds 150m reconstruction project to replace outdated equipment, improve public access, and modernise the backstage and front-of-house facilities - will come before a meeting of the planning and transport committee of Westminster City Council. It has been a drawn-out battle for the opera house, which has faced strenuous objections from local groups and statutory bodies which believe the plans do not suit the conservation status of Covent Garden. Since it decided to overhaul the site, the opera house management has come up with at least four 'masterplans' and has already received permission from Westminster City Council for two previous proposals. The scheme on the table tonight is a major revision of what has come before. Most significantly, the highly controversial proposals to build commercial offices to fund the project have been abandoned after Stanhope Properties advised the opera house board that the plan was no longer attractive because of the decline in the property market. But the scheme does contain highly-contested proposals to demolish four buildings on Russell Street, near the Covent Garden market piazza, and plans to take down half of the cast-iron Floral Hall to build a new foyer. The abandonment of commercial office space is being claimed as a victory by some groups of objectors - but they are still unhappy with the design of the latest proposal. 'We welcome the fact that at last we have a scheme which is more akin to what we have been campaigning for all along,' said Mr Jim Monahan, chairman of the Covent Garden Community Association planning committee. 'But we are intensely depressed by the present design, which is banal and does nothing for the area's conservation status.' Save Britain's Heritage, the Georgian Group and the Royal Fine Art Commission have reservations about the new scheme, though English Heritage is supportive. However, Westminster City Council planning officers have recommended that planning permission for the revised scheme be granted. One, Mr Gordon Chard, said: 'The changes are substantially for the better.' The opera house believes the new plans, which will include 100 additional seats and cost savings from more efficient equipment, will generate about Pounds 7m a year in extra income. The scheme also contains changes in design details, including a five-metre reduction in the new fly tower - which is now to be 43 metres high - and improved disabled access. The board plans to use extra revenues to make the opera more accessible to people traditionally unable to afford tickets. It will also designate Pounds 2m for a sinking fund to maintain and replace new facilities. Even if the opera house gets the go-ahead at tonight's meeting a start to the work still depends on adequate funding. Some Pounds 60m could be provided from retail units incorporated in the back of the building erected in 1981. Mr Jeremy Isaacs, general director of the Royal Opera House, hopes to obtain some funding - about Pounds 50m - from the Millennium Fund, sponsored by the National Lottery, although this is not assured.</p>

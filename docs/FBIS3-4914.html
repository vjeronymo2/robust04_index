The Education Ministry said 1,135 of the 1,330 teachers  reinstated in their former profession had reported to new  assignments across the country.    Of the rest, 159 will be assigned to schools during the  current semester and the remaining 36, who are either members of  city or county education boards or involved in lawsuits, will be  given jobs when their board tenure expires or when their cases  are cleared up.    Among the 1,419 teachers expelled for union activities, 89  were not reinstated for refusing to grant government officials  an interview, for not taking a refresher course or for vowing to  continue in the union, the Ministry said.    In Seoul, 454 of 508 sacked teachers have been reinstated  and  reported to some 340 schools in the capital area.    But most schools are expected to avoid placing these  teachers  in charge of a class for fear of the influence they, as former  unionists, may have over students.</p>

"Then I excused  the seniors and we addressed next season. A lot more guys walked out than what  the papers said we were losing. Reading the papers, I figured the whole team  was back.  </P> <P> "We had a better team when we started the meeting because a lot of guys were  not there when we ended it."  </P> <P> Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Boomer Esiason has a clause in his contract that  prohibits him from doing a television show or writing a book or newspaper and  magazine articles.  </P> <P> "I'm not allowed to write books," Esiason told reporters at the Super Bowl in  Miami this week. "I'm not allowed to host my own television show. You have the  Dan Marino Show down here; we're not allowed to have the Boomer Esiason Show.  I'm not allowed to sponsor a newspaper article or ghostwrite a magazine  article.  </P> <P> "I am allowed to go skiing. I'm allowed to go sky diving. What that shows us is  they're more afraid of me hurting myself with my mouth than they are with my  skis or my parachutes."  </P> <P> When shooting broke out in Miami Monday night, Joe Wellisch, who has season  tickets to the Miami Heat's basketball games, was warned by his wife not to go  to the game against the Phoenix Suns, which was eventually called off.  </P> <P> "My wife called me from Chicago and said, 'Don't go.'

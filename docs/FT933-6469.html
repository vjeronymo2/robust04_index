			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / Arts: When anatomy classes paid off - Scottish figurative painting alive and well Serious students of contemporary Scottish painting are enjoying an aestas mirabilis. North of the border, there are two important retrospectives, of Peter Howson at the McLellan Galleries in Glasgow (reviewed by Mary Rose Beaumont in July) and of Steven Campbell at the Talbot Rice Gallery in Edinburgh. The festival city, despite its official disdain for the visual arts, also offers non-representational work by Scottish artists at the College of Art. Those confined to London may take comfort, however. The Angela Flowers Gallery has organised an excellent survey of Scottish painting which fills both its East End branches until September. The strength of the show lies in the range of work, which goes beyond the generation which broke through to fame in the 1980s, to include work from both older and younger graduates of the four Scottish art schools, Glasgow, Edinburgh, Dundee and Aberdeen, and some of their teachers. As a student at Edinburgh College of Art I often found its academic discipline - life, still life and anatomy classes were compulsory - and the unquestioning acceptance of painting for painting's sake hard to bear. Eventually, however, I came to love the life class, and the absorbing struggle with that endlessly difficult task, the representation of the human figure. Many of the artists in this exhibition continue in this tradition, and their confident use of the figure is striking at a time when it is widely assumed to have ceased to be part of the contemporary artistic vocabulary. Also notable is the wide range of expressive purposes the figure is made to serve. John Bellany, father of the present generation of Scottish magical realists, fills large, semi-autobiographical, semi-mythical canvases like 'Bounteous Sea,' 1993, with a cast of sloe-eyed beauties both real and imaginary. Steven Campbell invents an impossible yet strangely familiar story-book world in work such as 'The Sadness of Swiss Peasants on the Rhine,' 1989, where some sinister meaning lurks close to the deceivingly light-hearted surface. The tradition of realism, drawing from the life, permits Jock McFadyen and Henry Kondracki to explore the city streets, capturing their inhabitants with humour and painterly dash. Peter Howson also uses his studies of street life as a basis for his enormous mythological canvases. Margaret Hunter and Gwen Hardie, who both studied with Georg Baselitz after their training in Scotland, make close examination of the figure central to their work. While in 'Woman with Apron,' 1992, Hunter's figure is stripped down to a primitive essence at its centre, Hardie moves ever closer to the body (usually her own), until in 'Unto Me,' 1992, details - in this case about three quarters of a face - become huge abstract forms rendered in blobs of paint applied with sponge or fingers. For June Redfern, in canvases such as 'Two Songs II,' 1992, large, usually female, figures articulate a psychological or spiritual space, brought alive by those other Scottish preoccupations, the importance of colour and the handling of paint. 'Painterly' was a term of praise in my time and must remain so, for there are few works here which do not merit it. Even those artists who have moved away from direct rendition of image on canvas to use their skills for different ends - the explorations of natural processes such as 'HDE 226868' by Glen Onwin, for example, or 'Symbol Stone,' 1983, by Kate Whiteford, reveal both their skill at and pleasure in mark making and textural richness. The purely abstract works are perhaps the weakest in the show, not quite far enough removed from their inspiration in landscape in the case of Buchan and Shanks or rigorous enough in their presentation of colour (Colombo, Maclean) to travel far from the merely decorative. Their handling of paint, however, as should be expected from the heirs of Peploe, McTaggart and Gillies, is unfailingly impressive. Alan Davie shows the usefulness of image to anchor abstraction, even though the eclecticism of his magpie hoard of symbols ultimately weakens their effect. Scottish painting is far from perfect. I still find myself baulking at its self-centredness, the narrow path from sketchbook to canvas, the reliance on a limited vocabulary of images - some drawn from the glorification of a brutal culture - and their repetition to the point of cliche. But these are generalisations, and this is a show of individuals, each of whose work demands attention, and the culmination of whose efforts over the last 30 years has led to the development of a body of work which grows ever more impressive with the passage of time. Scottish Painters, Flowers East and Flowers East at London Fields, 6 August until 12 September. Flowers East, 199/205 Richmond Road, London E8 3NJ. Tel 081 985 3333</p>

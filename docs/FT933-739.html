			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / Victorian canal restored for tourists A Victorian canal which was a financial disaster, attracting only eight fare-paying barges in its entire working life, has been restored as a tourist facility, Jim Kelly writes. The Pounds 28m project, which straddles the Ulster border, received funds from the European Regional Development Fund's Interreg programme, designed to promote co-operation between divided communities. The Ballinamore and Ballyconnell Canal, which links Northern Ireland's Lough Erne to the Irish Republic's River Shannon, was opened in 1860 but abandoned in 1869 because of competition from the railways. The 40-mile waterway has been cleared and rebuilt and the 16 locks fitted with computerised hydraulics. Mr Terry McGovern, marketing manager for the company marketing the waterway, said it was expected to attract in particular German, Swiss, Dutch and French tourists on cruising holidays and anglers from Britain.</p>

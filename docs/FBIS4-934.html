			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jono Waters] </F>   [Text] Johannesburg April 20 SAPA -- Thokoza was quiet on  Wednesday [20 April] morning following two days of violence  between residents of the East Rand township and hostel dwellers.    An National Peacekeeping Force [NPKF] spokesman said there  had been no shooting overnight. Five people died and more than  40 were wounded in Tuesday's running battles between the two  groups.    The Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP], which demanded the  withdrawal of the NPKF by 5 PM on Tuesday, was sticking to their  demand despite the political settlement reached on Tuesday for  the IFP's participation in next week's election.    IFP Transvaal Political Director Themba Khoza said the NPKF  must be removed "as quickly as possible" and replaced with the  Internal Stability Unit. "This is a confrontational situation,  they definitely have to remove the NPKF."    The Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] on Wednesday  cancelled their planned "Operation Access" tour of East Rand  townships "due to the excessive violence and unrest". The IEC  established "Operation Access" to help those parties promote  their election manifestos in townships that feel they cannot  campaign freely.</p>

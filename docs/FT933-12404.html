			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Unionists deal blow to Ulster dialogue THE government's under-standing with the Ulster Unionists appeared last night to have dealt a severe blow to prospects of renewing an inter-party, cross-border political dialogue on the future of Northern Ireland. Repeated government denials that a deal had been struck to secure Unionist support in Thursday night's critical Commons votes were greeted with scepticism at Westminster. Mr Seamus Mallon, of the mainly nationalist SDLP, said: 'I think the talks are dead.' The Newry and Armagh MP added: 'If we go into future negotiations we will need to be very clear whether we are dealing with the government or whether we are dealing with the Conservative and Unionist party.' The understanding itself appeared to consist of a vague undertaking by the nine Ulster Unionist party MPs that they would look sympathetically at supporting the government in times of greatest need. In return the government would lend a sympathetic ear to their views on issues such as setting up a Northern Ireland select committee and restoring accountable democracy to Ulster. One Unionist MP said privately that the understanding had been set up at a meeting between Mr John Major and Mr James Molyneaux, Ulster Unionist leader, earlier this month. There was a hint in yesterday's Commons debate that a select committee might indeed be a part of such an accord. This came when Sir Peter Emery, chairman of the Commons procedure committee, reminded MPs that the body had 'recommended for some time that Northern Ireland should have a select committee dealing with their affairs'. Last night the Rev Martin Smyth, Unionist MP for South Belfast, said he expected changes soon. 'We expect the prime minister to govern us properly. Therefore we want a select committee in the very near future,' he said. Publicly, Unionist MPs were attributing their support for the government to a 'co-ordinated campaign' by Mr John Hume, SDLP leader, and the Dublin government to promote Labour's ideas for joint British-Irish sovereignty for the province. Mr John Taylor, UUP MP for Strangford, said the possibility of the Unionists voting with Labour was 'crumbling' more than a week ago. Mr Hume yesterday described the Unionists' theory as 'balderdash', a view echoed by Irish officials who insisted there was no 'hidden agenda'. Irish officials said privately yesterday that they remained 'cautiously sceptical' about Mr Major's denial. The circumstances surrounding the vote had done 'nothing to help UK/Irish relations'. One Irish official said: 'We don't like Northern Ireland being used as a chip in a poker game at Westminster.' The Irish embassy described as 'complete moonshine' suggestions that Irish officials, the SDLP, and the Northern Ireland Office had in recent days been in secret talks aimed at developing the idea of joint British-Irish sovereignty over the province. The Northern Ireland Office repeated Mr Major's denial of a deal and said it still hoped for political progress in the province. Meanwhile, the events appeared to have given fresh momentum to a whispering campaign within the parliamentary Labour party against Mr Kevin McNamara, its Northern Ireland spokesman. One Labour front bencher said yesterday he would be 'surprised if Mr McNamara stayed in the long term', adding: 'You cannot see him as a secretary of state.'</p>

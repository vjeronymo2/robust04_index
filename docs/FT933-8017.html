			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / Balancing act in the pipeline: Disruption would accompany the break-up of British Gas. Is it politically acceptable? Mr Michael Heseltine, UK secretary of state for trade and industry, has had plenty of holiday reading heaped on him by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. But while yesterday's 2,000-page report contains a clear set of recommendations on how to deal with the monopoly of British Gas, he now has to judge whether they are politically acceptable. In this, he will have to weigh the government's deep-seated commitment to greater competition against the disruption that is bound to accompany the largest company break-up seen in the UK. There will be implications for domestic gas prices - always a highly sensitive subject - and for the wider energy balance where the future of coal is already at stake. Above all, he and his ministerial colleagues are keen for a solution that brings to an end the bitter squabbling between British Gas and its regulator, Ofgas, which has overshadowed the company since privatisation in 1986, and which triggered the monopoly inquiry in the first place. The clarity of the commission's report is both its strength and weakness. It is forthright about the anti-competitive effect of British Gas's dominance of all segments of the gas market, and about the remedies that are needed: British Gas must be made to sell off its supply business, and barriers must be lowered to allow more competitors to enter the market to supply households and other small consumers. Mr Graeme Odgers, commission chairman, said the present structure of British Gas's business 'is unable to provide the necessary conditions for self-sustaining competition'. The report is also a carefully crafted document. It sets out a timetable of events extending over nine years in a logical progression, leading from today's highly regulated environment to one in the year 2002 where the gas market is totally free. But some events are also designed as counterweights to others to keep disruption to a minimum. Thus, British Gas is allowed various price benefits to compensate it for the dismantling of its monopoly. However the commission's craftsmanship also makes it harder for Mr Heseltine to play around with the recommendations. If he only wants to accept part of them, or tries to change them, the whole package risks falling apart, rather like a Chinese puzzle. Will he, for example, accept the most dramatic recommendation: that British Gas be made to divest itself of its trading activities by 1997? This goes much further than most observers had been expecting because of the huge costs and practical difficulties in dismembering an industry of this size. It even exceeds the demands contained in a special report prepared by a number of British Gas's would-be competitors and Coopers &amp; Lybrand. They called for the separation of British Gas's activities into subsidiaries rather than a complete break-up. Logic, insofar as it is any guide, suggests that Mr Heseltine will agree to a break-up. The government is keen to stimulate competition. It has also been bombarded with criticism for transforming a string of utilities - from British Telecom to the electricity generators - into something approaching private sector monopolies. The monopolies commission gives it the opportunity to correct the problem in one sector. Mr Heseltine could still opt for the lesser course proposed by the Coopers report. But the commission is emphatic that this would not achieve the desired objective of creating true competition. It also asserts that the cost of break-up - Pounds 80m annually - is less than British Gas has been warning of, and would in any case be offset by lower prices as a result of increased competition. He also faces some tricky issues in the abolition of British Gas's monopoly of the tariff market for small consumers. Although the way forward should be clear to a free-market government, opening up any utility market to competition is fraught with problems. Under the present arrangements, a minority of British Gas's customers - the top third - pays more for its gas and subsidises the majority. This pricing structure would be swept away by competition, meaning, as the commission tactfully puts it, there would be 'winners and losers'. The 'postalised system', which currently ensures that all consumers pay the same no matter how much it costs to transport the gas to them, would also be sacrificed, so remote consumers would pay more. There are also technical and social problems in deregulating gas: who would be responsible for ensuring that the system operated safely, and who would supply the disadvantaged segments of the population? If the commission report has a weakness, it lies in its failure to address these difficulties. 'These are matters for the regulator,' Mr Odgers said yesterday. It would be easier for Mr Heseltine to deal with the commission's proposals if the government was not already embroiled in controversy over the imposition of value-added tax on home heating, and the long-running row over the run-down of the coal industry. Both these issues have shown that there are few better ways that the government can stir public ire than by interfering with the energy industry. It was already clear yesterday that the Labour party is ready to pounce on any move which suggests that little old ladies might be left shivering in the cold. There is one way Mr Heseltine could modify the recommendations to make the package as a whole more politically acceptable. The commission took the view that the costs of the restructuring should be loaded on to the consumer rather than British Gas's shareholders. This was because it believed that the company's profitability should be enhanced to enable it to attract investment - and presumably win British Gas's support for the package and help it fatten up the trading business for divestment. Mr Heseltine could redirect a portion of these costs on to British Gas itself, which would have the double advantage of keeping prices down for the consumer and ensuring that costs were being shared. Apart from the consumers and shareholders, a third constituency that needs to be catered for is the group of potential competitors. Unless the arrangements are sufficiently attractive, they will not participate and the whole exercise will fail. With its forthright emphasis on opening up the market, the report went down well with this group yesterday. Mr Edward Trafford, marketing director of Mobil, one of the largest suppliers of gas from the North Sea, commended the commission for 'good thinking' in the recommendations. 'They put British Gas on a level playing field. The timetable might be a bit faster but at least they've shown us the horizon we're heading for.' For British Gas itself, the report marks the beginning of a period of deep uncertainty, both over Mr Heseltine's intentions and, assuming he accepts most of its recommendations, the future of the gas business as it settles into its new shape. The hazard it faces is that Mr Heseltine will take the politically easier route of accepting only those parts of the report that profit the consumer without giving British Gas the countervailing benefits. However, it seems unlikely that Mr Heseltine can afford to be too selective as he pores over the recommendations. The question of whether more competition needs to be injected into the gas market is hardly at issue any more. The report has identified the two main defects of the gas business: the conflict of interest inherent in British Gas's control of all aspects of gas supply and transportation, and the effect of the lack of competition on prices and service standards. The question has now moved on to how best to deal with these defects. The Department of Trade and Industry was being studiously uncommunicative yesterday about its views on the report. But ministers have already indicated that they want a 'manageable' solution to the British Gas problem. By this they mean an outcome that satisfies most of the concerns of most of the interested parties. That is no small task. But the commission's report has clarified many of the issues in this most complex of monopolies, and pointed to the possible answers.</p>

			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / Hedge fund muscle sized up The financial resources deployed globally by highly leveraged hedge funds could exceed the size of the UK government bond market. Large and medium-sized hedge funds have an estimated Dollars 40bn-Dollars 45bn under management, according to MAR Hedge which tracks more than 100 large funds. But they exert a far greater impact on financial markets than their nominal size would suggest because they are so highly leveraged. Based on the MAR Hedge figures, if the funds have an average exposure of 10 times their nominal value, then they would account for global market exposure of close to Dollars 500bn. To put this in perspective, the total size of the UK government bond market is about Pounds 220bn, according to BZW. One head of bond trading in London said he believes that hedge funds' leveraged positions in the government bond markets total around Dollars 120bn at present. Heavy selling by hedge funds, particularly of European government bond futures, has driven down the markets in the past fortnight. Concern about these activities has prompted central bankers to launch inquiries about banks' exposure to hedge funds. While informal estimates put the total number of hedge funds at 800 to 3,000, many of these are relatively small and not widely followed. Ms Lois Peltz, managing editor of MAR Hedge, said that industry estimates of money under management range up to Dollars 100bn. Ms Nicola Meaden who runs Tass Management, a fund database service, estimates that the top 10-12 hedge funds 'probably have about Dollars 30bn under management'. These funds include Mr George Soros's Quantum Fund, the biggest of the hedge funds. The degree of leverage varies between funds, so that market exposure ranges from twice to 20 times their nominal size. By buying bond futures, for example, hedge fund managers can create highly leveraged positions in the fixed income markets, which can then drive prices in the cash market.</p>

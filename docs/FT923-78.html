Fiat's fortunes have prospered under Agnelli, but with the domestic economy souring and Fiat's share of the domestic car market now in steady decline, L'Avvocato, as he is known, may have decided he could hardly bend Fiat's rules which forbid anyone who is 75 during his term of office from standing for re-election.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["NG" report under the "In Brief Rubric: "Irina Khakamada </F> is for the Military"]    [Text] State Duma Deputy Irina Khakamada supports the  recommendations of the enlarged session of the Russian  Federation State Duma Defense Committee on increasing defense  spending to 55 trillion rubles from the 37.1 trillion that  figure in the draft Russian Federation budget currently under  discussion in the second reading. This sum could ensure that  the cost stays at the 1993 level in the actual implementation of  the budget. The Defense Committee's amendment did not go  through, however, at its first reading. Explaining her  position, Mrs. Khakamada said this is the minimal cost needed to  preserve the armed forces' combat effectiveness, maintain  important defense products, and carry through military reform.  The position on the question is a matter of principle for me,  she stated. It is the direct function of the state and one of  its main duties to increase the country's defense capability, as  well as to solve the social problems of servicemen and of their  families, even if there is a budget deficit. This constitutes  the fundamental difference between keeping defense outlays at  the necessary level and deficit financing of inefficient sectors  of the national economy. Sustaining the army even at the cost  of a budget deficit makes the state stronger in the final  analysis, whereas uncontrolled spending of funds dictated by the  lobbyists of various sectors only weakens it.</p>

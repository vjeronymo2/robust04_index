			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["14th Anniversary of Heroic Kwangju Popular Uprising </F> Marked" -- KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, May 24 (KCNA) -- Mass rallies took place  in different parts of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea  to mark the 14th anniversary of the heroic Kwangju popular  uprising.    Mass rallies were held on May 22 and 23 in North Pyongan,  South Hwanghae and Kangwon Provinces and Kaesong municipality.    Senior officials and representatives of workers,  agricultural  working people, youth and students and men of culture in the  Provinces and municipality spoke at the rallies.    The speakers said the Kwangju popular uprising in May 1980  was a massive armed uprising in which the entire Kwangju  citizens turned out and made a decisive resistance to the  fascist violence in order to terminate the colonial domination  of the U.S. imperialists and the military fascist rule and to  achieve democratisation of the South Korean society and the  reunification of the country, and a just anti-U.S., anti-fascist  democratic resistance.    The desire of the valiant Kwangju resistance fighters for  independence and democratisation of the South Korean society  still has not been realized owing to the colonial enslavement  policy of the U.S. imperialists, they noted.    They stressed that in order to overthrow the Kim Yong-sam  puppet regime and realize the desire of the martyrs of Kwangju,  the South Korean students and people should wage vigorous mass  struggles in all places to scrap such fascist laws as the  "National Security Law", dissolve all the repressive machines  and establish a true democratic government.    They stressed the need for the people of all segments of  South Korea to turn out to check and frustrate the colonial  domination and interference of the United States and get the  U.S. Forces and nuclear weapons withdrawn from South Korea.</p>

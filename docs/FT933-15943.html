			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets: Muted response to Buba rate cut Poor economic news from the US, political uncertainty in Japan, and a weak response by senior European bourses to the first Bundesbank key interest rate cuts in more than two months, restricted the FT-Actuaries World Index to a token gain, of 0.1 per cent in local currency terms, last week. On Wall Street, the Dow was flat in advance of the week's economic data, beat a minor tactical retreat on Thursday's drop in the NAPM index of industrial activity, and tumbled after Friday's rise in the national unemployment rate. The losses in equities, however, were restrained by an improvement in the domestic bond market. Japan's equity market, similarly, started with a recovery as the ruling Liberal Democratic party showed resilience in municipal elections in Tokyo. However, after that it faltered, fluctuated and faltered again on a bribery scandal in the construction industry, and renewed political uncertainty ahead of the Japanese general election in 12 days' time. The Bundesbank rate cuts were the first since April 22. Bourses had anticipated them, although 50 basis points off the discount rate, against a 25-point cut in the Lombard, was more than most analysts had expected. Unfortunately, although a number of other European central banks cut their rates too, the depth of the German discount rate cut rebounded against equity markets as economists decided that the Bundesbank was now unlikely to come back with another rate cut until September. The most interesting performances last week were put in by Belgium and the Nordic bloc in Europe, and by the Pacific markets excluding Japan. After peaking in April, Belgium suffered along with other strong currency markets as the Bundesbank's interest rate policies were hamstrung by the costs of integrating eastern Germany and its wariness of domestic inflation. However, says Ms Rachael Rowe of Kleinwort Benson, Belgium delivered an outstanding performance in June as two domestic interest rate cuts in as many weeks drove the market to an all-time high. 'The next Bundesbank rate reduction is not expected until after the summer recess,' says Ms Rowe, 'but the Belgian desire to reduce rates in concert with the Dutch should drive the market higher'. Finland was the outstanding performer of the week with an 8.6 per cent gain, taking its local currency appreciation to 46.3 per cent this year. Helsinki was the prime mover in a Nordic bloc rise of 2.5 per cent; but Hoare Govett notes that the market was not permanently on the upgrade, falling 8.8 per cent during the month to June 25 and underperforming continental Europe by 6.2 per cent. Performance around the Pacific Rim has been taken almost for granted in the past quarter, as fund managers have tried to escape from the grinding poverty of US equity returns, the slowdown in Japan and the fear that Europe had seen all of its gains in virtually the first three months of 1993. But Australia, which has been lagging behind, came close to the front of the pack as the gold bullion price put on another spurt and gold shares rose 17.8 per cent.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                           MARKETS IN PERSPECTIVE  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                  % change    % change in                   % change in local currency**   sterling**  USDollars**               1 Week  4 Weeks   1 Year  Start of  Start of    Start of                                           1993      1993        1993  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Austria       -1.26    +4.95    -5.82     +9.22     +4.50       +4.05 Belgium       +2.34    +8.98   +12.69    +16.44    +11.57      +11.09 Denmark       +1.78    +7.38    -0.63    +21.49    +17.29      +16.79 Finland       +8.61    +2.97   +64.67    +46.29    +35.41      +34.84 France        -0.36    +4.33    +4.84     +7.13     +3.55       +3.11 Germany       +0.42    +3.19    -4.43    +10.31     +5.80       +5.34 Ireland       +3.57    +4.45   +26.18    +35.26    +20.32      +19.80 Italy         +1.44    +4.44   +35.61    +30.44    +25.16      +24.62 Netherlands   +0.36    +4.98   +13.76    +15.01    +10.34       +9.86 Norway        +2.18    +3.62   +10.23    +16.88    +12.97      +12.48 Spain         -0.04    -0.93   +12.26    +21.33     +7.84       +7.38 Sweden        +1.75    -0.24   +21.56    +11.41     +2.48       +2.04 Switzerland   +0.51    +3.57   +25.16    +15.57    +12.69      +12.20 UK            -0.91    +1.01   +17.23     +2.09     +2.09       +1.65 EUROPE        -0.02    +2.61   +12.87     +8.93     +6.07       +5.61  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Australia     +3.57    +1.03    +1.67    +10.65     +8.05       +7.58 Hong Kong     +2.64    +0.40   +13.72    +31.59    +32.09      +31.25 Japan         +0.09    -4.77   +23.94    +19.91    +38.25      +37.66 Malaysia      +3.82    -1.46   +42.08    +25.46    +28.03      +27.48 New Zealand   +2.24    +2.24    +9.46    +12.50    +19.38      +18.86 Singapore     +2.97    -2.46   +13.76    +16.83    +18.60      +18.09  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Canada        -0.99    +1.25    +9.08    +12.58    +11.61      +11.14 USA           -0.21    -0.79    +8.80     +2.48     +2.92       +2.48 Mexico        +1.99    +3.53    +4.16     -8.49     -8.25       -8.64  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- South Africa  +2.98    +5.52   +13.66    +33.03    +40.55      +39.95  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- WORLD INDEX   +0.08    -1.16   +13.70     +9.78    +13.74      +13.27  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- ** Based on July 2nd 1993.

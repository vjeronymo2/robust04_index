			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Statement by Roman Czerwinski, under secretary of state in </F> the Ministry of Industry and Trade, as noted by Aleksander  Malkiewicz: "On Defense Industries, There Will Not Be Factory  Liquidations"]    [Text] By now, several months have passed since the  Ministry of Industry and Trade decided on the restructuring and  ownership transformations of the defense industry. The trade  unionists striking last 3 February demanded that [the  government] increase to 5.5 trillion zlotys [Z] its orders  placed with the defense industry, provide funds for  restructuring its enterprises, raise wages, offer reimbursement  for the funds spent on maintaining readiness for wartime  production during the years 1990-93 and for the equipment  exported to the former USSR, and, last, that it reduce the  number of countries to which it has embargoed arms shipments.    ``Recent Sejm legislation has made it possible to operate  defense-industry enterprises on the basis of laws governing  joint-stock companies rather than state enterprises. At the same  time, I wish to emphasize that the minister of industry and  trade wants to execute on his own the provisions of the Law on  the Privatization of State Enterprises rather than leave them to  the minister of ownership transformations. That is because it is  the duty of the latter minister to not just privatize but also,  among other things, to sell enterprises [to private investors],  whereas our minister is going to utilize the new law on  ownership transformations at defense-industry plants in order to  restructure these plants while, at the same time, retaining them  under the control of the State Treasury. Now that this law was  passed by a large majority in the Sejm, we at the ministry are  preparing to utilize this instrument as effectively as possible  immediately after it takes effect.    ``Let me remind you that, in the past, we isolated a group  of  enterprises to be classified as arms-industry enterprises. The  26 such enterprises that have by now been partially converted to  single-person Treasury companies [an intermediate stage of  privatization] have been divided into enterprises manufacturing  ammunition and classical weaponry, radioelectronic and optical  equipment enterprises, aviation enterprises, and artillery and  armor enterprises. The principal premises of the restructuring  and development programs are to apply equally to all of these  groups.    ``Another instrument that we have already been effectively  utilizing since last June is the conclusion of civil-law  agreements between enterprises and companies, on the one hand,  and the State Treasury, represented by the minister of industry,  on the other, to offset the cost of maintaining unused  productive and technological capacities of the arms industry. We  have increased the industry's exports markedly--by as much as 40  percent compared with 1992--although I must regretfully admit  that we have not yet reattained the 1989 level of our exports.  We assume, however, that we shall break that record if not this  year then the next, owing to the improving situation on the  world markets. We also pay great attention to sponsoring the  development of new civilian products; here the Committee for  Scientific Research provides us with considerable support by  funding 50 percent of the related targeted projects.    ``By 31 March, the effects of the new law on the financial  restructuring of banks and enterprises should become tangible.  Some of our enterprises have been able to sign agreements under  that law. We expect the worst-performing among defense-industry  enterprises to sign such agreements with their creditors, which  means that not only our ministry but also the banks will  consider positively the possibilities for the restructuring and  further management of that industry.    ``We also have new declarations, new instruments that will  be  applied this year. At the ministry, we are trying to increase  the number of government loan guarantees provided. Altogether,  about Z25 trillion is earmarked in the budget for such  guarantees, and, at its next meeting, the Council of Ministers  will consider, among other things, providing such guarantees for  the Mielec Transportation Equipment Plant. Moreover, providing  them also for the Hydral Transportation Equipment Plant in  Wroclaw is currently under discussion at our ministry. Others,  too, are helping us. Thus, the minister of foreign economic  relations is trying to get more funds to spend on promoting  [foreign sales of the products] of the four above-mentioned  arms-industry groups. Hence, this also concerns interministerial  cooperation in certain domains rather than cooperation among  discrete enterprises.    "In connection with the discussion of programs for social  protection, the Sejm is currently considering a law on so-called  preretirement benefits; that law will especially apply to  arms-industry enterprises because they are located in regions of  greatest unemployment. We shall not at the same time try to  utilize the Z2 trillion allocated to us by the World Bank for  the social protection of the employees of shut-down plants.  Under our program, in classifying 31 enterprises as  arms-industry ones, we were guided by the principle of mergers  instead of shutdowns. Thus, none of these enterprises will be  closed."</p>

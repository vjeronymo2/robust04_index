The meeting will be the first to bring  together the four leaders at the centre of the unfolding  political drama.    It is understood the chaos that racked central Johannesburg  on Monday triggered the urgent attempt to bring the leaders  together.    ANC Secretary General Cyril Ramaphosa and Minister of  Constitutional Development Roelf Meyer left a scheduled  Transitional Executive Council management committee meeting on  Monday afternoon to join the IFP's Joe Matthews and the  kwaZulu's Ben Ngubane for talks on the summit.</p>

			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] The Spanish daily press has demonstrated  a growing interest in environmental issues. Leading newspapers  such as EL MUNDO, EL PAIS, DIARIO 16, and CINCO DIAS report  regularly on this topic. The two latter sources have added  weekly environmental supplements titled "Biosphere" and  "Environment" respectively. The following are environmental  issues being reported prominently in the Spanish press.  <H5>  Environmental Complaints Viewed </H5>   A 26 March article in EL PAIS notes that one-third of all  complaints received by the Public Defender's Office in 1993 were  related to the environment and of these 90 percent focused on  noise pollution. Margarita Retuerto, acting public  defender/ombudsman interviewed by EL PAIS, criticized Spain's  legal track record on the environment. Retuerto said that Spain  currently "lacks the legal framework" to properly handle  environmental pollution cases and is at a further disadvantage  due to its "disjointed and dispersed bureaucracy." Aside from  noise pollution, citizens complained about "environmental  pollution, insufficient protection for open spaces and  waterways, and demanded the right to have greater access to  environmental information." According to the Public Defender's  Office, the number of environmental complaints rose steadily in  1993, pointing to citizens' increased awareness.  <H5>  ENDESA Case Profiled </H5>   According to a 1 February commentary in CINCO DIAS by Maria  A. Gonzalez, attorney and director of the Praxis Environmental  Consulting firm, a current environmental case before the courts  involves the National Electric Power Company (ENDESA). ENDESA's  Teruel-based power plant is charged with spreading acid rain  throughout a large forested area in El Maestrazgo, a mountainous  district of the Castellon and Teruel provinces in eastern Spain.  Approximately 200,000 hectares of forests in the El Maestrazgo  region were ravaged with damages estimated at around 10 billion  pesetas ($73 million). A 22 February article in CINCO DIAS by  Arturo Cenzano reports that legal proceedings began six years  ago and involve ENDESA's president Feliciano Fuster and three  other executives. Fuster has been sentenced to pay a fine worth  5 billion pesetas ($36.5 million). The prosecutor has asked for  one-year prison sentences for these individuals, which has  angered environmental groups demanding longer sentences. A 26  March article in EL PAIS reports that ENDESA has already begun  taking steps to reduce pollution stemming from its Teruel power  plant. According to this article, in March 1994, Juan Manuel  Eguiagaray, Minister of Industry and Energy announced that  ENDESA would spend 23 billion pesetas ($167.9 million) to reduce  sulfur dioxide emissions.    In her CINCO DIAS commentary, Gonzalez points to the  difficulties inherent in determining guilt when several  potential polluters are involved in a single case. Further  difficulties arise when it comes to verifying and substantiating  relationships between the causes and effects of pollution. In  some cases, the cumulative effects of pollution cannot be  ascribed to a single factor, but rather to a variety of causes  that are completely unrelated. For example, in March 1993 CINCO  DIAS published the findings of the Center for Environmental  Studies on the Mediterranean (CEAM), which exonerated ENDESA of  sole responsibility for causing acid rain in Castellon. The  report blames two petrochemical complexes in southern France and  the Piombino region in central Italy for spreading sulfur  dioxide emissions in the Castellon district.    Cenzano's article notes that the ENDESA lawsuit has caused  anxiety among people who depend on jobs created by the  Teruel-based Electric Power Company. The Aragon Employers  Association is concerned because ENDESA created 6,400 jobs in an  area that has been struggling economically. According to  Cenzano, members of the Employers Association defend ENDESA on  the grounds that the company has been a proven leader in the  fight against environmental waste by investing upwards of 30  billion pesetas ($219 million) over the past few years.  <H5>  Companies Seek Information on Environmental Issues </H5>   The Center for Documentation and Information on Industry and  the Environment (CIDIMA), located in Madrid, offers Spanish  companies a wide range of information on environmental concerns  and legislation, according to a 15 March report in CINCO DIAS by  Ana Hernando. The center, which opened in February 1994, is  located at and under the direction of the School for Industrial  Organization (EOI). CIDIMA director Jesus Santa-Olalla, who was  interviewed by CINCO DIAS, believes the center's customers will  be small and medium-sized businesses that lack access to  information on environmental standards. During its first month  in operation, CIDIMA was primarily consulted by companies  concerned about violating environmental standards,  service-oriented companies, retailers, and a vast number of  private and public institutions focusing on environmental  issues. Most requests focused on EU [European Union]  environmental standards and nonpolluting or "clean" technologies.    CIDIMA maintains contacts with similar centers in France,  Germany, Denmark, and the United Kingdom for informational  exchanges. For instance, the center has an ongoing agreement  with the British Library. CIDIMA is currently busy setting up  branches in several of Spain's autonomous communities so that  environmental organizations within these areas can distribute  CIDIMA services. EOI's board of directors is now considering  establishing a CIDIMA branch in Seville, because it believes  "this city could well become a springboard for providing CIDIMA  services to South America." Negotiations are now under way with  the Argentine Government to set up a branch in that country.    To set up CIDIMA, EOI invested 50 million pesetas  ($365,000),  which also happens to be CIDIMA's projected annual budget.  Santa-Olalla noted that at first companies felt "threatened by  the large investments needed to equip businesses with  environmentally sound technologies." Now, however, corporations  are changing their attitudes and realizing that in the long run,  the effects of environmental improvements will help them  "generate larger profits and make their products more  competitive."  <H5>  Large Investments Needed To Adapt to EU Standards </H5>   In the 15 March CINCO DIAS Ana Hernando quotes estimates of  between 1.5 and 3 trillion pesetas ($10.9-21.9 billion) that  would be needed to adapt Spanish industries to EU environmental  standards. Reportedly, the chemical sector will require the  largest investment. This sector will absorb an estimated 39  percent of the financial aid available through the European Fund  for Economic Compensation to introduce more environmentally  sound technology. The energy sector will require an investment  of 31 percent, the automobile industry 9 percent, and the  construction industry 5 percent of the European Funds' financial  assistance. Economic forecasts calculate that the Spanish oil  industry will have to invest more than 500 billion pesetas  ($3.65 billion) during the next seven years to safeguard the  environment.    The Ministry of Industry and Energy plans to promote  projects  and technologies geared toward reducing pollution levels. By EU  standards, the environmental sector in Spain remains a fledgling  one, since Spanish companies in this sector account for only 3  percent of EU's total market for the environmental industry. By  the year 2000, however, the environmental industry in Spain will  grow to around 50 trillion pesetas ($365 billion).</p>

Should we  rejoice?    Let us leave in parentheses the fact that the edict of 24  December 1993 was promulgated only on 29 January 1994. Let us  note that this event is remarkable by the fact that the  government itself finally recognized its debt to the depositors.  But it is in just this pleasantness that questions begin and  end. And the first one: Why is the sum of compensation  (threefold) so laughably small?    But it is necessary to find even this money somewhere.  Where? If even in a number of oblast and regions there is  nothing with which to pay wages. Where did this number  "threefold" come from? I would like to pose these and a number  of other questions to people who have some connection with the  edict. Someone worked on it, which means that someone will  implement it. But I was not successful in getting any kind of  information on this from either the Central Bank, the Savings  Bank, or the Ministry of Finance. Employees of the Central Bank  said that "for us this edict is like snow on our heads."    The document turned out to be just the same unexpected snow  for the Society for Defending the Interests of Bank Depositors  (the name of the Society speaks for itself). At their request,  deputy V. Mukusev raised the issue of indexing deposits at the  Supreme Soviet and the corresponding law was adopted. Then  representatives of the Society "passed it by" the Constitutional  Court, which recognized the justice of their demand. Now in  connection with the president's edict a statement was adopted at  the Society's meeting, which states, in part:    "The president's edict No 2292 is insulting to us not only  because of the miserly nature of the proposed compensation, but  also by the means of finding the money, the proposed sale abroad  of precious metals and precious stones from the State Reserves  of Russia. We state that any processes squandering the wealth  of Russia are unacceptable as a source of money for compensating  the depositors. Therefore we call upon the RF Federation  Council to take control of the State Reserves of precious metals  and precious stones. We are ready to show in open discussion  that a noninflationary method for restoring the old savings of  our co-citizens exists."    Using similar slogans, having united with Movement for  Social  Justice, the Society will picket the central board of Sberbank  on 10 February. Society co-chairman Valeriy Akinin considers:    "Several variants for resolving this problem exist. There is  even similar foreign experience. It's only necessary to want  it. A government which will undertake the task of reimbursing  the full volume of savings will guarantee itself a minimum of 70  million votes (one for each depositor) in any elections. Elena  Sannikova, a member of our Society, has worked out a program for  a noninlfationary restoration of the money, and in the near  future we will send it to the government."    But while the arguments about the forms and size of  compensation payments are going on, Sberbank has set about  fulfilling the president's edict. Maria Kasatkina, an employee  of the Sokolniki Sberbank reported:    "Despite the fact that the money promised under the edict  has  not been transferred to Sberbank's account, we are beginning to  pay compensation from the money we have in our own account.  First to be compensated will be pensioners and invalids, who  will need to have the corresponding cerfication, passport, and  savings book. Compensation will be paid to the remaining  categories of citizens starting on 1 July. According to the  depositor's wish, the money can be moved anywhere, transferred  to another account or paid in cash. However, opening  non-interest deposit accounts for paying for housing and  communal services, which is mentioned in the president's edict  and in Sberbank's directive sent to its branches, is not  provided for."    The Sberbank workers asked me: "Write about this so that  people won't get excited, so that there won't be any panic or  agitation."    Really, what is there to be excited about? In the Sberbank  closest to my house, dinnertime was approaching. The bank was  empty. Perhaps the time I chose was unfortunate--TV was showing  the film "Simply Maria" at the same time.</p>

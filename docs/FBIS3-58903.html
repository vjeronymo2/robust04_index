			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel has  called on the Asian countries to give German companies easier  access to their markets. The Federal Government expects  conditions comparable to those existing for Asian products and  businesses in Germany, the FDP [Free Democratic Party] chairman  said today in opening a conference attended by 21 German  ambassadors in Bonn. He promised "political support" for German  companies, which want long-term involvement in Asia. The  promotion of economic interests in the region has priority in  Germany's Asian policy.    In Kinkel's view, Germany and Europe should have access to  the growth markets of Asia in order to retain their  competitiveness. "We are faced in our country with the challenge  of achieving a necessary thrust for modernization through  restructuring and innovation." More intensive contacts on a  political level are also required, however. On the grounds of  their economic strength, the major Asian states are in the  process of asserting their right to have a say internationally .    Kinkel said the Bundeswehr would continue to be involved "in  an appropriate manner" in international operations in the  region, as in Cambodia most recently. Bonn would also comment  in future on gross violations of human rights in the region.    The main points of future German Asian policy are to be set  out at the three-day conference, which is also attended by  German industry representatives.</p>

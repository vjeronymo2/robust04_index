			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / Survey of Indonesia (14): Diplomatic row highlights sensitivity to criticism - Manuela Saragosa reviews foreign policy in the context of the region A diplomatic row between the Philippines and Indonesia earlier this month highlighted once again Indonesia's sensitivity to criticism from abroad about human rights abuses in East Timor - but also hinted at the fragility of political unity within the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean). Relations between Indonesia and the Philippines became decidedly uncomfortable in May. The question of East Timor, always a thorn in the flesh of Indonesia's foreign policy, was at the centre of a diplomatic spat between the two countries which are usually content to march under Asean's banner of solidarity. It started when the University of the Philippines, based in Manila, agreed to host the Asia Pacific Conference on East Timor. In the argument which followed, an angry Mr Ali Alatas, the Indonesian minister for foreign affairs, threatened to break off diplomatic relations with the Philippines if the Filipino government did not ban the conference. A diplomatic envoy sent expressly from the Philippines did his best to explain that his government had no constitutional power to prevent the conference from taking place because it was organised by non-governmental organisations. Asked if the incident could damage relations between the two countries, Mr Alatas responded: 'It could be a possibility.' The conference went ahead anyway, but Indonesia's lamentations were not completely without effect. The Filipino government tried to bar foreign academics and human rights campaigners attending the conference from entering the country; in a number of cases it was successful. 'The whole affair was very embarrassing,' a Jakarta-based diplomat says. It was embarrassing for the Philippines, which felt obliged to succumb to Indonesian pressure, and it was embarrassing for Indonesia because of the criticism which followed. The Philippines and Indonesia accused one another of interfering in each other's domestic affairs. ( The pillars of Asean rest on promises by its member states - Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei and the Philippines - not to meddle in each others' politics.) The problem, as one Asean official sees it, is the 'differing levels of tolerance for political openness within Asean member states.' In Indonesia people do not have the right to assemble freely - government approval is needed for gatherings attended by five or more people - but the Philippines is a struggling democracy where freedom of assembly is guaranteed by the country's constitution. The manner in which Indonesia handled the incident was in direct contrast to its usual policy of keeping a low profile - and in contrast, too, to its highly applauded efforts in attempting to negotiate a settlement in the Cambodia conflict. As the row over the conference unfolded, Indonesia was accused of bullying a friendly neighbour. More to the point, the incident also demonstrated the lengths to which Indonesia will go to defend its stance on policy towards the former Portuguese colony. The irony is that the noisy protests made by the Indonesian government gave the conference worldwide publicity and brought East Timor back into the headlines. Besides, it clashed with Indonesia's earlier policy of guaranteeing more openness about the East Timor issue, in what it hoped would 'promote understanding of the problems in the region.' Earlier this year, foreign journalists were invited on a government-sponsored tour of the region. The aim was to demonstrate how much money had been spent by the Indonesian government in improving East Timor's infrastructure and building schools and hospitals. As Mr Irawan Abidin, director of information at the ministry for foreign affairs, put it: 'Indonesia's sincere intent to give substance to the freedom won by the people of East Timor is reflected in its continuous efforts to accelerate the social, economic and political development of East Timor.' However, the film footage of the Dili massacre of November 1991, which showed the military shooting into a crowd of unarmed independence demonstrators, is still fresh in many people's minds. What the Indonesian government does not appear to have anticipated, in its objections to the Manila conference, was the bad publicity it would earn. Indonesian newspapers bewailed the fact that attempts to stop the conference helped develop it into a media blitz which portrayed Indonesia as the 'bad guy' member of Asean. One speaker invited to attend the conference, Mrs Danielle Mitterrand, the wife of French President Francois Mitterrand, accused the Indonesian government of exercising 'tyrannical pressure' on her not to attend. Critics say that Indonesia's outrage at the holding of the conference only lent credence to human rights activists' accusations that the Indonesian government is tyrannical and authoritarian. That is exactly the kind of reputation the government is trying to shed now that it is becoming more tolerant of public debate. There is growing irritation in government that the only time Indonesia makes the headlines abroad is on matters relating to East Timor. Meanwhile, Asean officials are anxious to point out that this kind of dispute between member states is not unusual. In the past, for example, there have been territorial disputes between Thailand and Malaysia which have eventually been resolved. 'It is not unusual to see something like this happening in Asean,' says an official. 'But it is certainly not the end of Asean.' Officials say that Asean, which was set up in 1967 to provide a forum for economic co-operation, could not afford to break up over an argument between two member states, even if their policies differ significantly. In an increasingly competitive economic environment, 'Asean realises that it has to stick together,' the official says. The diplomatic row between Indonesia and the Philippines may have been intense, but it was very short-lived. By mid-June, two weeks after the end of the East Timor conference, President Suharto assured a Filipino senator that he supported 'traditional relations of friendship' and senior officials in Manila were quoted as saying that relations between the two countries were back to normal. But it remains to be seen how Indonesia will react if further conferences on East Timor take place in the south east Asian region. Mr Murdiono, the Indonesian state secretary, said that a representative of the Filipino government promised there would be no more conferences on the subject, but senators in the Philippines claim to be unaware of this promise. Indonesia's handling of the East Timor conference may have been a veiled warning to neighbouring countries to steer clear of sensitive issues in the country. In the meantime, critics say that the affair has done little to improve the government's reputation.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [State of the nation address by President Eduardo Frei </F> Ruiz-Tagle at the opening of the 1994 congressional period in  Valparaiso -- live or recorded]    [Excerpts] [monitored in progress] ...and has been built  during our democratic life. I have come to this Congress with  an open and confident spirit. I am not unfamiliar with  Congress. I came from it. I know its virtues and limitations.  The presidential system of government believes Congress is a  place for real encounter and cooperation. Great Chilean  congressmen have contributed under that political system.  [passage omitted]    What is the basic idea this president wants to convey to  this  sovereign assembly at the beginning of his administration?    I have come to assert that Chile has a great historic  opportunity. I have come to invite the country to take this  opportunity. I have come to explain how the government hopes to  take advantage of this opportunity in the immediate and near  future. Taking an opportunity means recognizing it. Our great  writers and historians have taught us that Chile had other  opportunities in the past. One of them is very well known  because when it was not taken, it meant a long history of  national frustrations.    The people feel great bitterness when they lose their  opportunity and have to wait for a long time for a new one. An  opportunity is not a miracle as a result of a plan or the magic  or force of a political boss. An opportunity is the result of  work by all the people which sometimes does not come true  because of disagreements among their leaders or because the size  of the projects is not up to the circumstances. This is when  the sacrifice of the people can become useless and forgotten.    I am deeply convinced that a powerful series of national and  international factors have opened a great opportunity for us.  Chile has grown over the past 10 years at an average rate of  over 6 percent a year, which is unusual in the history of Chile.  During this period, our exports increased at a rate of over 9  percent, inflation decreased from an average 20 percent per year  in the second half of the 1980's to an average 13 percent during  the last two years. These achievements were made along with a  historic reduction of unemployment, which dropped from an  average of over 17 percent in the last decade to about 5 percent  in the last few years.    Our great hope in the future, however, lies in increasing  our  savings and investments. During recent decades, the savings  rate never surpassed 18 percent of the GDP, in the last few  years it has risen to about 22 percent. In the last couple of  years, the investment rate, which traditionally never reached 20  percent, has risen to between 25 and 27 percent. This is  unprecedented in the last 50 years of Chilean economic history.    This economic growth will be accompanied by a greater social  determination through a decrease in poverty levels and an  increase in production. This was the start of an era in which  we have achieved economic growth with equity. If we are able to  maintain this trend in the next 10 years, our country will  certainly have reached the threshold to overcome  underdevelopment.    World transformations have opened new horizons for our  expectations of economic growth and a new political, cultural  and social agenda. The internationalization of the economy is a  reality today. We face the challenge of exporting all goods and  services with comparative advantages to all countries throughout  the world. Soon there will come a time when our traditional  economy will probably continue to grow and, at the same time, we  will perfect the current comparative advantages and thus achieve  proper margins of competitiveness of new goods and services.    The new post-Cold War international agenda is ambivalent. On  the one hand, the conflict that characterized the second half of  this century -- which during peak political tensions  internationalized intrinsically local issues as we Chileans know  too well -- is categorically over. On the other hand, we are  simultaneously witnessing the opening of new expectations of  altruism with new threats of barbarism.    The end of bipolarity has done away with rigid dogmas that  characterized our recent past and allows for a wider, more  diversified, and richer discussion of the options available at  all social levels. The globalization of communications and an  increasing interaction, however, challenge our identity. We  need to critically assimilate the global culture that surrounds  us through our own development.    If our social, political, and economic coexistence become  cosmopolitan without an adequate hierarchical order, our  Republic runs the risk of becoming a true Tower of Babel. To  assume this historic opportunity, we must prioritize subjects,  objectives, and challenges; and thus center our country's energy  on the needs of our people. This should be achieved by  concentrating our efforts in those areas which have a greater  impact on the quality of life of all Chileans.    We have defined three great tasks that must be assumed with  a patriotic attitude because beyond being the specific duties of  the administration in power, the future of all Chileans depends  on these national objectives. They are: the consolidation of  our economic development, eradication of extreme poverty, and  establishment of a modern labor code; the design of effective  and all-encompassing health and education systems able to meet  the demands of a fast-growing society; and lastly, the insertion  of Chile into the international scenario.    In the last few years, Chile has conquered a privileged  position among countries with developing economies. This  constitutes a solid basis upon which to build the country all  Chileans desire. We are determined to continue to build and  expand this path toward development on the basis of equity and  stability. The success achieved in the recent past compels us  to redouble our efforts in the immediate future.    This year, we experienced an economic adjustment process  that  will result in an economic growth of about four percent and an  estimated inflation rate of 11 percent. Today's sacrifices,  however, are an investment for the future. We will be  inflexible in our struggle to curb inflation because it  constitutes the worst tax to burden those fellow citizens who  live off a salary or wage.    This is a high priority task for my administration. In the  past few months, we have already adopted measures to decrease  high spending. We will not curb the inflation rate by resorting  to the easy alternative of decreasing the exchange rate because  it will undermine our exports.    There will be no economic growth without effort and  sacrifice. We will achieve a greater economic growth only if we  are able to significantly increase our national investments and  savings. This compels us to be more austere both at the private  and public levels by avoiding spending, which many times is  justified, and thus increase our savings and finance investments.    Continued high economic growth demands constant efforts to  strengthen savings and investments and their effectiveness is  strongly tied to development and the expansion of the financial  market. We are committed to implementing the new capital  markets law promptly. We hope to achieve a reasonable and  timely solution to the debt of private banks with the Central  Bank through the adoption of responsible measures that will not  undermine the Central Bank's patrimony.    The government, which will persevere in its efforts, will  use  the savings and investment fiscal policy, the commercial policy,  and production incentives, as tools to achieve the following  goals: 1) To curb inflation so that during my administration we  may achieve single-digit inflation comparable to that of  successful economies; 2) a real economic growth of no less than  5.5 percent during my administration so that by the year 1999 we  may increase the current per capita income of $3,160 to about  $4,400. This represents a 38 percent increase at today's  current values; 3) a more dynamic job market to increase the job  and labor force by 2.5 percent per year; 4) a production  increase that will average about 3 percent per year. Although  this is demanding, it will allow economic growth on a more  equitable basis; 5) a gradual but systematic increase of real  salary levels to substantially increase the real salary of  workers during my administration; 6) a significant increase in  consumption levels of low-income families in line with the new  sustainable opportunity pattern [patron de oportunidades  sustentables] which is designed for them; 7) a continuation  of our commercial opening process by expediting the  internationalization process of the financial and investment  fields to considerably increase our competitive levels. [passage  omitted]    Throughout history, Chilean foreign policy has always  abided by the following main principles: Firm respect for  international law, the peaceful solution of conflicts,  international cooperation, support for democracy, and friendly  relations among all nations.    Within the current international context, compliance with  these principles is evinced by the active and dynamic support  given to the internationalization of Chile's economy through  what we call diplomacy for development.    With this encouraging attitude in mind, we have defined  three  main targets for our country's foreign policy. First, we will  seek to further internationalize the Chilean economy through  alliances and agreements which will give us a better chance of  becoming part of an increasingly interconnected world. Our  second objective is to improve our relations with our main trade  partners throughout the world, while fostering an atmosphere  conducive to the strengthening of democratic stability,  especially in Latin America. Our third objective will be to  selectively participate in initiatives to attain peace, foster  democracy, increase respect for human rights, and implement  development and social fairness throughout the world.    We will act in keeping with certain guidelines and policies.  Our country fully supports the principle of open regionalism  and believes that regional agreements are the appropriate  mechanism to expand trade and investments. We believe these  agreements should ultimately seek increasingly free world trade.  This approach allows us to unilaterally open our economy, sign  bilateral agreement, and actively participate in multilateral  negotiations.    Our foreign policy will give priority to our ties with other  Latin American countries. Latin America has again become one of  the world's most economically dynamic areas. Economic  integration and complementariness are, thus, more necessary than  ever. We would like to contribute to the shoring up of an  atmosphere of peace, dialogue and mutual trust among the  countries of this region. With this objective in mind, we will  implement a policy based on constructive rapprochement, and  physical and economic integration. This year, we expect the  court of arbitration will issue a ruling that will end the  dispute [with Argentina] over Laguna del Desierto, thus reducing  pending border disputes to the minimum.    Our evaluation of the results of bilateral agreements Chile  has signed so far with Mexico, Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, and  Venezuela, is very positive. These agreements and our domestic  policies that seek to further open our economy have contributed  to make more dynamic our commercial relations with other Latin  American countries. We will continue to negotiate with Ecuador,  and we hope that our talks with Peru and Brazil will make more  headway than they have so far.    We are especially interested in our relations with the  Common  Market of the South [Mercosur] to which Chile's two main Latin  American trade partners belong. In the coming months, Chile  will propose to Mercosur a mechanism which, without requiring us  to become a partner in that common market, will pave the way for  the establishment of a free trade zone in the region.    We are aware that in the medium term, it will become  necessary to find a regional framework to reconcile the many  partial agreements that various countries have reached among  themselves. The Latin American Integration Association [ALADI]  should provide us with the proper legal foundation for an  integration policy, and provide the main scenario for  multilateral action to the point of becoming a true Latin  American trade forum.    Chile will support efforts to make the Rio Group the common  representative for Latin America at global debates. This group  must expand its economic scope, especially to join forces  against protectionist measures which threaten our development.  The Rio Group must resume its initial quest for political  agreements to tackle pending problems related to peace, security  and coexistence in Latin America.    Our Latin American policy must be fully compatible with our  drive for greater participation in world markets. My  administration will give priority attention to the negotiation  of bilateral or multilateral agreements aimed at the attainment  of this objective.    We want to broaden our bilateral agenda with the northern  countries. With the U.S. Government, we recently made the  political decision to begin negotiating a free trade agreement  which could be either bilateral or multilateral by having Chile  join NAFTA. My administration views negotiations for this kind  of agreement as a priority.    This does not mean just any agreement will be attractive to  us. It is very important to coordinate negotiations and properly  weigh the impact of the various elements such as the opening of  the goods and services market, trade regulations, mechanisms to  resolve disputes, intellectual property, investments,  environment, labor affairs, and other issues that an agreement  of this kind involves. Only through a joint effort by the entire  country will the negotiations have a positive outcome for Chile,  and pave the road for other Latin American countries.    Europe is also an important target for our foreign policy.  The EU is the world's largest common market, and continues to  be one of Chile's main commercial partners. Furthermore, our  country has excellent political relations with the European  countries. These relations are based on deep-rooted common  values and this has prompted a significant flow of cooperation  and investment. We have things in common that we want to  develop and thus strengthen commercial ties with the EU and its  members and to soften the impact of protectionist tendencies  that harm Chile. We are prepared to negotiate -- either  bilaterally or multilaterally through the Rio Group -- a  partnership with Europe that will give stability to our  commercial and financial operations.    Chile's foreign policy also seeks to increase the opening  toward the Asian-Pacific countries. The Pacific Basin is bound  to be one of the main scenarios of the future world. In October  this year, we will join the Asia Pacific Cooperation, APEC, thus  crowning our efforts to tighten bonds with that part of the  world. Our presence in the Asian-Pacific region is, however,  not strong enough yet. The Chilean Government can create  favorable conditions and establish the necessary contacts, but  it is up to private entrepreneurs to make use of these  facilities daringly and creatively if we truly want to make  Chile Latin America's outlet to the Pacific. [passage omitted]    The protection of the environment and natural resources is  yet another priority of my administration. Our work to protect  the environment will abide not only by the provisions of the  Constitution and of the Basic Law for the Environment; we will  also take several other steps. The state will be given  effective legal, economic, and administrative tools to include  protection of the environment in the policies for each sector.  For this the administration will strengthen the National  Environment Commission [Conama] and the appropriate regional  commissions.    This year we will develop and implement the rules and  regulations for the evaluation of the environment, which the  Basic Law for the Environment calls for, and the regulations  that will allow us to set environmental standards. We will  improve the people's environmental awareness through formal and  informal education methods aimed at fostering  environment-conscious behavior patterns. For this, we will  train over 1,200 monitors over the next three years.    The administration will promote environmentally sustainable  technological development. Along those lines, we are already  implementing a program of subsidies for technological upgrading  aimed at reducing by 60 or 70 percent the consumption of  industrial components that harm the ozone layer by the year 1996.    We also want to develop consultative mechanisms for the  citizenry and the productive sectors concerning the drafting of  environmental policies and instruments. The administration is  already in touch with these sectors in its effort to create the  above mechanisms. This effort will be strengthened soon through  the establishment of a communications center under the Conama  umbrella, and by involving social agents in the adjustment and  implementation in Chile of the Rio-21 environmental agenda.    We will actively involve public agencies that have a role  to play in the preservation of the environment in solving  administrative problems and in training and the allocation of  resources. To accomplish this, we have the invaluable support of  a World Bank program which is already operational.    We will implement a program to control water and air  contamination, for which the appropriate standards will be  established. The administration will also encourage financial  companies to support worthwhile environmental projects. For  this, the administration will expedite technological upgrades  and allow the companies to comply with regulations by providing  the lines of credit to finance the necessary investments.    We will support the environmental efforts of the  municipalities for which instructions have been issued to  develop the necessary instruments for better and more effective  management of urban, industrial, and dangerous waste. We will  also strive for a more effective use of energy. As part of our  planning of the use of energy, and in keeping with our  international commitments, we have prepared a list of gases  related to the greenhouse effect. We will also improve the  national wildlife reserve system, coastal zoning, and marine  reserves. [passage omitted]    The future of our nation is safeguarded by a nonpartisan,  coherent national defense policy designed in consensus by  democratic institutions. No particular problem will deflect us  from these guidelines. In matters of national defense, the  administration will assume its pertinent role of strategic and  political leadership. To this effect, it will strengthen and  streamline the existing defense institutions. It will promote  the adequate modernization of our Armed Forces by granting them  a stable budget based on strategic criteria, and by assuming the  challenge of reorganizing them in keeping with the demands of  the international and regional scenarios.    We want all citizens to be aware of the privileges and  duties  that the task of national defense entails. We will actively  promote the involvement of civilians, at the academic and  technical level, in the development of the Armed Forces and in  national defense matters. The administration will promote this  national awareness through a National Defense Report to be  issued in one year. This report, which will be available to all  citizens, will explain in detail the objectives and tools of our  national defense.    My administration has decided to fully occupy Chilean soil,  sea, and air spaces. We will consolidate and integrate our  domestic borders and will effectively occupy our lands. To this  effect we will study the initiative that the Chilean Army has  promoted in this regard within the vast concept of the  regionalization and national development programs.    Moreover, when I opened the Month of the Sea, I proposed a  series of initiatives for the development of a sea policy. In  addition, the Navy has made important contributions to  developing sea resources, which constitutes a new privileged  space for development opportunities.    We need an organization to promote these initiatives and to  coordinate the activities of those organizations dealing with  sea-related activities. In view of this, within a six-month  period, the government will establish a National Oceanic  Commission that will be in charge of overseeing the effective  occupation of the sea, the safeguarding of Chilean rights, and  the balanced exploitation of sea resources.    The administration is also closely following the vast  prospects for the peaceful exploitation of space:  communications, weather forecasting, and environment. In view  of this, it will study the Chilean Air Force's proposal to  create a national space institute.    Our challenges in the defense area will be based on the  pillars of knowledge to promote the commitment of citizens and a  national defense policy for a safe future. [passage omitted]    There will be no sustainable development for our fatherland  if we are unable to establish well-designed and effective  political institutions that are recognized by all as just and  legitimate. There are countries with successful economies that  have been ruined by faults in their political systems. There  have also been countries with truly legitimate political systems  that have seen their development frustrated because of the  explosion of longstanding social conflicts, or because of their  inability to draft a coherent security and defense policy.    My administration has proposed that the constitutional  reform  be discussed within the broader framework of the state reform  and modernization program in order to adjust it to international  changes at the economic, international affairs, and political  levels. This is not a question of minorities or majorities or  an issue concerning the imposition of the will of one group over  that of the other. By definition and essence, this is an issue  of consensus.    I want to be perfectly clear on this issue. I propose,  therefore, a frank, open, and constructive proposal. I believe  everyone must admit that there are a large number of issues in  the current constitutional order that lack consensus. No matter  on which side of the fence you are standing -- among those who  defend the current constitutional order or those who criticize  it -- we must admit that this constitutional order lacks the  consensus it should and needs to have.    There is a lot of contradictory criticism in Chile about the  electoral system, the municipal order, the manner in which  mayors are elected, the limits and procedure for controlling  legislative elections, or how the Senate is formed. Moreover, a  series of proposals and initiatives are circulating on  inabilities and incompatibilities in regional council reforms.    It is neither practical nor ethical for our country to  exhaust these issues in rigid political struggles without  implementing this reform. On this basis I urge you to adopt a  futuristic outlook, one of rapprochement through dialogue, and  one that seeks constructive solutions in congress and in the  political parties' debates.    Let us overcome stagnation because this only helps to  aggravate problems. Let us not use this issue to point out the  differences between government and opposition parties. Let us  not adopt a narrow-minded attitude by only proposing reforms  based on either government or opposition power strategies. Let  us not center our discussions on ideological issues or try to  seek personal attention. If we avoid these temptations, we will  be able to have a constructive debate instead of one that will  increase our differences.    More specifically, more than centering our discussions on  authoritarian enclaves to safeguard democracy, we must face the  challenge of defining what kind of congress we need for Chile;  and of establishing a municipal order that heeds the current  national needs, seeking democracy at the municipal level,  decentralization, efficient administration, and ethicality.    Within this context, my administration is working on two  constitutional reform bills which we will soon submit to  Congress. The first is inspired by the idea of having an  expeditious and modern congress with truly democratically  elected members.    In view of this, we will be proposing reforms in the  following areas. First, the reform of the electoral system,  establishing one that will guarantee reasonable results based on  the principle of one citizen, one vote, and reflecting the  representativity of main opinion trends, contributing to  political stability and long-term governability.    We are also open to reforms that will increase the  effectiveness of legislative work, expedite paper proceedings,  and make less bureaucratic the drafting of bills.    In this regard, the government proposes to do away with the  differences between ordinary and extraordinary congressional  terms. Moreover, it proposes reforms seeking to make joint  committees more efficient and expedite proceedings in the  drafting of laws. We are willing to introduce reforms to the  Constitution that will increase the supervisory duties of the  Chamber of Deputies.    A modern congress must offer guarantees to congressional  minority blocs so that they can exercise their supervisory  duties in an effective and responsible manner. This  presupposes, under terms to be specified, a decrease in the  number of legislators needed for the establishment of  investigating committees [applause], but it also guarantees the  responsible exercise of supervisory duties so that no one  shielded by legislative immunity may undermine the honor and  dignity of people without being punished. [applause]    A constitutional reform, like the one we aspire to implement  in Congress, cannot exclude the case of designated senators.  The proposal of this amendment does not presuppose an adverse  judgement against the persons who are today exercising these  duties. My administration is convinced that the Senate must be  formed on the basis of the will of the people. [applause]    The second constitutional reform draft bill to which we are  devoted is that concerning municipal government. This  administration is willing to discuss an amendment that will  allow the direct election of mayors. The approval of this  reform compels us to carry out an exhaustive discussion of the  overall modernization of the municipal administration system,  which presupposes the study of several interrelated issues.    Let us consolidate our institutions on the basis of national  objectives. We need coherent and overall democratic operational  objectives at the regional and municipal levels. Let us keep in  mind that what is at stake here is the competence and the  essential resources needed to achieve an equitable balance  between the municipalities and regions of our country.    There is another issue I would like to comment on, which  affects the quality of politics, the administration of the  state, and our entire society. I am referring to ethics and  morality.    Chile is a country with an honorable tradition of public  service. We must safeguard and protect this moral patrimony.  Though they are of course serious, the recent reports of  irregularities and abnormalities cannot compel us to say that we  are facing a situation of systematic or rampant corruption.    Nonetheless, we must be prudent and safeguard our fatherland  with a view to the future. We also cannot ignore that drug  trafficking and other illegal transactions are dangers that are  looming over our fatherland.    In view of this my administration is determined to increase  the quality of life of our citizens by reasserting the moral  values that are essential for public servants; by improving the  social control of government leaders; and by increasing openness  in the exercise of political duties and in the interrelation  between political and economic power through a more effective  handling of public assets and institutions.    The lack of public ethics is the result of an uncontrolled  exercise of power, and ambiguous responsibilities. In view of  this we must define responsibilities, and what is legal and  illegal in public life. This is a consensus that must be  achieved with the ultimate objective of restoring a new national  public ethics code.    The promotion of morality presupposes the achievement of a  national consensus because public ethics affect private business  and public administration alike. In view of this, we have  promoted and established the National Public Ethics Committee,  encompassing all the branches of government and representatives  of civilian society. Its objective is to draft guidelines  which, once introduced through administrative and legislative  measures, will be clear guidelines for preventing and punishing  behavior that is not in keeping with ethics and morality. We  will have specific results in this regard within a couple of  months.    We will continue to work relentlessly, but calmly and  diligently, in the same manner in which we have written the  history of our nation.    My government will comply with its duty in this area. By  the end of this millennium, we either will or will not have  taken full advantage of the historic opportunity we have  received from the nation, with the unprecedented circumstances  existing in the world today.    One of the most common ways of undermining the strength and  drive of the national plan is by hiding behind group interests.  The relative situation of neglect affecting any given group,  within the context of various production and service sectors,  will be corrected only through a persevering, effective, and  coherent policy. There is no other way of reversing the  historical process that provoked the weakening of that sector.    Each Chilean must be aware of what this new opportunity is  all about. We must find ways to stop opportunists, hasty  populists, and those who are still longing for polarization and  violence. Each Chilean should know that political stability is  an essential condition for economic growth. Everyone,  especially the lower income sectors, must know the extent to  which social development is dependent on economic growth. The  poorer, humbler people can still tell between those who seek  progress and those who only instigate useless disputes.    Ending an era in which ideologies prevailed cannot generate  a  void entailing a lack of ideologies or ideas. Drawing on the  nation's spiritual strength, we must build a common democratic  foundation. This foundation, which ought to be based on  ethical-legal principles, must promote a culture upholding  responsibility. This foundation should be taught in schools,  families, and through the media, as well as in churches and in  other national spiritual centers, so that it may be legally  binding for everyone.    The country must reaffirm its resolve to act with the  strength of its old pioneers. The country requires new efforts  and new tasks, without which the national plan will lose  strength. Civic friendship and a conciliatory spirit are the  driving forces behind this new opportunity. The desire to  search for agreements has been one of our major achievements in  our coexistence in recent years. This desire may thus not be  conceived as a mere truce, or as a ruse to block the action of  the opposition. To search for agreements is to promote  understanding rather than confrontation; it means to understand  that development requires stability; it entails awareness that  politics is built on confidence, which gives way to constructive  behavior. It means to understand that no agreement will bring  adverse effects on those who promoted it, but that it will  rather bring legitimacy and glory upon those who promoted it.  [applause]    In this spirit I urge everyone to look, without pause, for  basic agreements concerning the rules of the political and  economic games and broad cooperation among the branches of  government. Let us be aware of this opportunity. We have the  chance to humanize politics. Let us all make sure that our  legitimate democratic disagreements stay on a suitable course.  We have made much progress, but let us not fail at such a  decisive moment for our economic expansion and political  consolidation. [passage omitted]    The nation must display sound, calm optimism in order to  continue treading this historic path. By the end of the next  decade, the resolve of each Chilean will have made a great  nation from this small community. [passage omitted]    Seventy days ago I solemnly pledged here to respect the  Constitution and the laws, and to work for the greatness of the  fatherland. Today, complying with the desire of our people,  without arrogance, with happy humbleness, with resolve, courage,  and strength, I am committed to leading our country on the path  leading to this great opportunity. May God enlighten me in this  great task. Long live Chile! [applause]</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Roundtable discussion with Tsutomu Hata, foreign minister </F> and deputy prime minister, and commentator Naoki Tanaka, both in  NHK's Tokyo studio, and Akira Yamagishi, chairman of the  Japanese Trade Union Confederation (Rengo), and Osamu Uno,  chairman of the Kansai Economic Federation, via relay from  Osaka; from the "Sunday Discussion" program moderated by NHK  commentator Takashi Yamamoto -- live]    [Excerpts] [Yamamoto] Good morning.    [Hata] Good morning.    [Yamamoto] I understand, Mr. Hata, you have long said that  you had no intention of becoming a politician. However, Mr.  Hata, you are now going to become the chief executive running  the state administration. How do you feel at the moment?    [Hata] Well, in my career as a politician, I have always  tried to challenge my own destiny. In greeting the new  situation, I once again keenly feel that heavy responsibilities  will rest on my shoulders. Frankly speaking, this is how I feel  now. [passage omitted on discussion of various issues such as  early enactment of budget bill, dual power structure, tax  reform, and Hata's relationship with Ichiro Ozawa]    [Yamamoto] As foreign minister, Mr. Hata, you have been  directly engaged in dealing with Japan-U.S. relations. You must  have a better understanding of the points at issue than anyone  else. Do you have any plans to make new proposals for taking  concrete measures to reduce the trade surplus or deal with other  issues?    [Hata] First, it has just been mentioned that Japan-U.S.  relations are deadlocked at this moment. I discussed this issue  with Mr. Gore, and also with U.S. Trade Representative Kantor in  Marrakech recently. We have agreed that each of our two  countries has now come to realize wherein lie the points at  issue and major differences in our awareness, and at the same  time we have come to understand well what each other has to say.    However, as has been pointed out just now, it will take some  time to arrive at a conclusion because these issues involve  individual sectors. In this sense, frankly speaking I felt that  they are concerned with macroeconomic issues, too. Therefore,  as has just been pointed out, there exist such problems as what  measures should be taken to expand domestic demands and to  promote imports. However, I feel we should not believe that  measures for expanding domestic demands or promoting imports  should be taken merely for the purpose of reducing the trade  surplus. On the contrary, if we tackle these issues from the  viewpoint that these measures will also contribute to the  improvement of the people's livelihood, I am sure we will be  able to win understanding, and even the other side's  understanding.    As has been mentioned, these measures should be applicable  also to other areas such as European and Asian countries. If  they should be applicable merely to issues existing between  Japan and the United States, a question will then arise: Why  was it necessary for GATT talks to be held recently? I believe  that in tackling these issues, attention must be paid to these  factors. [passage omitted on Tanaka's remarks on increase in  investment]    [Tanaka] Incidentally, there is an item on deregulation in  the recently-signed document on the items for confirmation in  establishing the new coalition administration. However, the  expression seems to indicate retrogression as compared with the  statement in the Administrative Reform Outlines [ARO] published  last February. It merely says that market revitalization should  be promoted through extensive easing of excessive economic  regulations. No mention was made on the original ARO statement  which says economic regulations should be abolished in principle.    Does this indicate that there is retrogression in the ARO  principle because of various factors such as bureaucrats'  influence or pressure from individual industrial organizations?    [Hata] No. It is so stated as a brief expression but I  believe there is no such influence or pressure. As a cabinet  member, I have stated my views at various meetings, including  panel sessions on this issue sponsored by industrial circles on  some occasions. Executives of some industrial organizations  have even called for implementing deregulation, maintaining that  they are now determined because they understand that in easing  or abolishing economic regulations, some circles are bound to be  hit hard but that a society genuinely filled with vitality can  never be created without overcoming such difficulties. In fact,  just recently I made these remarks at a meeting held about a  week or 10 days before my tour to Marrakech. [passage omitted  on Uno's remarks on administrative reform]    [Yamagishi] I also have something to say. I agree with  your opinion. After all, it is not good for the future of Japan  if it continues to be the only nation in the world with a huge  trade surplus. It is necessary for Japan not only to cut its  trade surplus but also to promote a shift from an external  demand-oriented economy to a domestic demand-oriented one.  Japan is called a nation with high nominal wages but low real  wages. Why is this so? It is because commodity prices are high  in this nation. In particular, housing and food prices are very  high compared with those in Europe and the United States. It is  a stark fact that price gaps exist between Japan and other  countries. The government needs to promote thorough  deregulation to rectify the price gaps. Mr. Hata just explained  the policy platform agreed upon by the ruling parties. I  receive this platform positively because I believe it has been  formulated based on the agreement on the abolition of economic  regulations reached when the Hosokawa cabinet was inaugurated.  But it will not be easy to promote it. It is certain that  bureaucrats will strongly oppose deregulation. In that case,  the prime minister will be asked to exercise leadership.    I recently met with a senior official of the ruling  coalition  who is a defector from the Liberal Democratic Party. He said  that at the change of cabinet, the new prime minister should  obtain letters of resignation from bureaucrats such as  administrative vice ministers so that he can dismiss them if  they do not give devoted service to the cabinet. I sincerely  hope Mr. Hata will exercise powerful leadership.    [Yamamoto] Let us again hear Mr. Hata's resolve to exercise  leadership as prime minister.    [Hata] I totally agree with what all of you have said. I  met with the chief cabinet secretary and others this morning.  In the meeting, they said nothing would change unless the new  cabinet promotes deregulation. They expressed anxiety about the  future of Japan's society and economy, and asked me to seriously  consider what they said. We are fully aware of what you have  pointed out. We also know from experience what will prevent the  government from promoting deregulation. Keeping in mind what  you have said, we will exercise leadership.    [Uno] I am glad that Mr. Hata agrees with us about  deregulation. There is another issue coupled with deregulation.  That is decentralization of political power. It has been said  that the number of regulations should be cut through  deregulation, and that of the remaining regulations, those which  are related to people's living should be enforced by local  governments. What is important in promoting decentralization is  to clarify the roles to be played by the central government,  local governments, bureaucrats, and the private sector. The  government's tasks include tackling diplomatic, security, and  financial issues. I hope the government gives more effort to  this task. Other issues which can be handled by the private  sector or those related to people's living should be taken care  of by local governments. I sincerely hope the government will  promote decentralization by all means. I believe the former  Hosokawa government was considering enacting legislation for  deregulation. Also, ruling and opposition parties unanimously  adopted resolutions on decentralization at both the upper and  lower houses last June. Thus, I hope the new cabinet will  continue efforts for decentralization.    [Yamamoto] Now, we will move on to the Korean peninsula  issue. Mr. Uno earlier used the word Hokusen. It is not the  right name. The correct name is the Democratic People's  Republic of Korea. Well, we have outlined the main points of  the coalition parties' fundamental policies. One of them is  that they would abide by UN policies on the Korean issue. Does  this mean that the government will give all-out cooperation to  the United Nations if it decides to impose economic sanctions  against North Korea?    [Hata] Generally speaking, yes. However, it is said that  the United Nations wants to settle the issue through dialogue  while being considerate to the DPRK. I should not comment  further on this matter.    [Tanaka] The issue of Japan's cooperation with the United  States and the ROK [in time of emergency] was also talked about  at the coalition parties' policy meeting. But, the discussion  became complicated because the Social Democratic Party of Japan  [SDPJ] wanted to include China in the cooperative ties between  Japan, the United States, and the ROK. Eventually, an agreement  was reached to drop China. Does that mean the coalition does  not want China to be involved in critical matters of security  because the United States and the ROK are involved? Was the  priority order revealed, so to speak?    [Hata] No, I do not think so. We are allies bound by the  Japan-U.S. Security Treaty and U.S.-ROK Security Treaty. As I  have been saying, China has the strongest influence over the  DPRK when it comes to the issue of nuclear arms development.  China does not appreciate the existence of nuclear weapons on  the Korean peninsula. After all, we must have discussions with  China. I think the meeting did not adopt a resolution on this  issue but a chairman's statement was announced instead because  of China's influential power.    [Tanaka] Japan and the United States talked about the issue  of North Korea's suspected nuclear arms development when Les  Aspin, then U.S. secretary of state, visited Japan last fall.  Of late, William Perry came to Japan and you had discussions  with him on the nuclear issue. Was the U.S. secretary of  defense very much worried about the North Korean nuclear issue?    [Hata] Well, I do not think the situation on the Korean  peninsula is such that war can break out at the slightest  provocation. However, North Korea has to accept the  International Atomic Energy Agency's inspections to dispel the  suspicion. Otherwise, the suspicion will continue to grow in the  international arena.    The United States has deployed Patriot interceptor missiles  in South Korea to be prepared for possible attack from North  Korea. We are preparing for the worst. Fundamentally, however,  we want to settle the issue through dialogue.    [Tanaka] Is the U.S. Government saying that Japan should  clarify how it will deal with the issue of North Korea's  suspected nuclear arms development?    [Hata] No. The United States clearly understands that Japan  will deal with the issue within the scope of the Constitution.  Also, it is said that the United States is highly assessing the  fact that Japan is holding discussions with China and other  countries to settle the issue. Therefore, we think that the  United States and Japan clearly understand each other's stand.    [Yamamoto] It is possible that the United States and the ROK  may want Japan to stop the remittance of money to North Korea  even if the United Nations does not decide to impose economic  sanctions against North Korea. Can you comment on this?    [Hata] The United Nations still has not taken up the issue  of economic sanctions as a topic of discussion. Therefore, we  should not talk about something that is an assumption based on  assumptions. Also, I am still only a foreign minister.  Generally speaking, however, we will deal with the situation,  if anything should happen, within the scope of the Constitution.    [Yamamoto] One of the fundamental policies states that the  government will be prepared for an emergency case. Does the  emergency case mean military action?    [Hata] North Korea is saying that economic sanctions will be  considered as a de facto declaration of war against it.  Probably, discussions were made within this context.    [Tanaka] Do you think Japan will have no choice but to take  further action to confine North Korean nuclear weapons if the  United States says, after the United Nations adopts a  resolution, that it has no choice but to assume a clearer stance  to confine North Korea's nuclear weapons?    [Hata] Well, I should not comment on this matter either.  Generally speaking, however, some countries in other regions are  succumbing to the temptation of possessing nuclear weapons.  Therefore, the nuclear issue, if North Korea has actually  developed nuclear weapons, will have an impact on these  countries. Not only the United States but also European  countries are interested in the issue of North Korea's suspected  nuclear weapons development. Japan, in particular, is North  Korea's neighboring country so we just cannot take it easy. We  have to say that North Korea, no matter what, should not be  allowed to develop nuclear weapons.    [Yamamoto] Now, I would like to ask you about imminent  issues. Do you think it is difficult to make a large-scale  cabinet reshuffle because budget deliberations have to start  soon?    [Hata] It is hard for me to comment on this matter because I  am not yet prime minister. Generally speaking, the most ideal  way is for the ministers who were involved in mapping out the  budget draft to deal with this matter. However, since we will  be forming a coalition cabinet, I think we have to listen to the  opinions of each party. We will deal with this matter by taking  these factors into consideration.    [Yamamoto] As we have been discussing, the next  administration will be confronted with many important tasks.  Therefore, some members of Shinseito are of the opinion that you  should have a strong cabinet lineup.    [Hata] Every party has different opinions within itself. I  think the current cabinet is composed of prominent people.  However, there are different movements in each party.  Therefore, we need to have a firm understanding of the  situation to deal with the important tasks if we continue to  remain in power.    [Yamamoto] The leaders of all coalition parties, except for  the SDPJ, are in the cabinet. Do you think [SDPJ Chairman]  Murayama will join the next cabinet?    [Hata] Again, I can only give you a general opinion. If we  become a governing party, then...[changing thought] Originally,  we agreed that party leaders would become cabinet members. If  they are cabinet members, then we can meet each other every day.    [Yamamoto] You can have a party leaders' meeting every day?    [Hata] That's right. In that sense, I may ask Murayama to  join the cabinet. However, the SDPJ may have its own idea.    [Yamamoto] Do you want him to join your cabinet?    [Hata] Judging from previous examples, I think you can say  that.    [Yamamoto] The Hosokawa cabinet had some problems with the  chief cabinet secretary. What do you think of the role of chief  cabinet secretary?    [Hata] It is desirable if the chief cabinet secretary shares  the same views as the prime minister.    [Yamamoto] You mean he should play a role of supporting the  prime minister?    [Hata] Yes. The chief cabinet secretary is the prime  minister's spokesman.    [Yamamoto] They should be on intimate terms.    [Hata] That's right.    [Yamamoto] Does that mean the chief cabinet secretary will  be selected from among the Shinseito members?    [Hata] Well, I still am not prime minister yet. I can only  answer you in a general way on this matter too.    [Yamamoto] You will also have to select a new foreign  minister, your successor. It is a very important post. Do you  think factions will be an important factor in selecting your  successor?    [Hata] I do not think so. We are in the coalition so that I  should make no bones about such things. However, we need to  choose a suitable person for the post.    [Tanaka] I heard that many current ministers will remain in  their posts. If that is so, then are you going to ask your  ministers to take a clear leadership role to promote  administrative reform? As has been said before, your cabinet  will be calling for free economic activities, in principle, and  thereby allowing the private sector to display its own vital  power. Are you going to tell your ministers to play a  leadership role at each critical moment?    [Hata] Needless to say, I have to do that if I am in such a  position. As I said earlier, this is an issue which can be done  only at the time of administration change. No zoku [group of  people concerned with specific issues] exists, and members share  the same intention when a new administration is formed.  Therefore, that will be a good change to do what you have just  said. Also, a direction for decentralization of the government  can be set only at that time.    [Tanaka] The voters will critically evaluate your cabinet  lineup. As prime minister, are you going to tell your ministers  how you will evaluate their performance? Did any prime minister  give such an instruction to his cabinet members before?    [Hata] When I became agriculture, forestry and fisheries  minister, I was told to do everything as I wished because I had  been doing what I was expected to do.    [Tanaka] Are you going to say the same thing to your  ministers?    [Hata] If I become a prime minister, I will ask my ministers  to do their best.    [Yamamoto] Since politics is changing significantly, some  people, needless to say, may say that the new administration  should listen to the people's opinions as soon as possible.  What do you think of holding a general election?    [Hata] During the previous general election, the voters  criticized the closed nature of politics. Another thing is that  they wanted to see changes in Japanese politics. Somebody said  earlier that nothing has changed. Well, the LDP became an  opposition party and former opposition parties became ruling  parties. I suppose it appeared strange to the people at the  beginning. However, when you look around coolly, you will note  that things are changing significantly.    [Yamamoto] Does that mean that the next election will be  held under the new system? It will not be held under the  current medium-sized precinct system?    [Hata] Fundamentally, I do not think that we should not  restrict the prime minister's right to dissolve a cabinet. In  this sense, it is possible that a general election can be held  under the current system. However, we survived the previous  election so that we have a general idea of what the people want.  We need to respond to people's expectations. It is not the  time to think about dissolving the cabinet now. [passage omitted  on remarks by Uno and Yamagishi]    [Yamamoto] Somebody said earlier that you should make a new  ministerial post in charge of international relations. What do  you think of this proposal?    [Hata] Again, I have to speak on the assumption that I am in  the position of forming a new cabinet. Anyhow, it will be  difficult to do so if we have a double power structure. I know  that some people are of the opinion that I should create the new  ministerial post. However, I still do not have a clear plan for  forming the new post.    [Yamamoto] The time is up. Thank you very much for being  with us today.</p>

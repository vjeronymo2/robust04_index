			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / International Company News: Pirelli plans sale of Condumex stake PIRELLI, the troubled Italian cables and tyre manufacturer, has decided to sell for Dollars 140m its 30.4 per cent stake in Condumex, the principal channel for its Mexican operations, to Grupo Carso, the fast-growing Mexican industrial group controlled by Mr Carlos Slim. The sale is part of Pirelli's rationalisation plans to offset losses caused mainly by its failed bid last year for Continental, the German tyre manufacturer. Although Pirelli is reducing fixed investment in Mexico, it has reached a broad co-operation agreement with Grupo Carso which will assure the Italian company privileged status as a 'preferred supplier'. Pirelli will become a long-term supplier of technology and products in the cables sector through Condumex. Grupo Carso is now the largest shareholder in Telmex, the recently privatised national telephone company which is committed to a significant expansion programme over the coming years. Ilva, the Italian state steel group, has sold a 5 per cent stake in Siderca, Argentina's largest seamless steel tube manufacturer. The sale, mainly placed privately by Morgan Stanley with US and European investors, raised Dollars 75m. Ilva retains some 6 per cent in Siderca, the third largest company capitalised on the Buenos Aires Stock Exchange.</p>

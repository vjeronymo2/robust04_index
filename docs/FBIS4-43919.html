			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "nh": "Gaddum: Germany Is Following the Path </F> of Convergence"]    [Text] Frankfurt, 18 Jun -- Despite the current  difficulties, Germany, together with other countries, is in the  process of fulfilling the Maastricht criteria for convergence  within the appropriate period. However, it is already clear  that, in view of the two potential dates for entering the third  stage of the Economic and Monetary Union [EMU], the later date  of 1999 seems more realistic, Bundesbank Vice President Johann  Wilhelm Gaddum said at the Konrad Adenauer Foundation in New  York. The monetary side of the Maastricht Treaty is an  absolutely solid basis for a lasting and stability-oriented  monetary policy in a monetary union. If one takes into account  that a European central bank can influence exchange rate policy  far more than any central bank at the moment, some public  expressions of dissatisfaction with the Maastricht Treaty are  more difficult to understand. At the moment there is no reason  to doubt that the antiinflation consensus of the member states  will be consolidated.    Gaddum stressed that the economic advantages of monetary  union are not exhausted with eliminating exchange rate risks and  avoiding transaction costs. Of far greater importance is the  promotion of economic cooperation, which emanates from the  contents of the Maastricht Treaty and the anticipation of its  introduction. In making an economic evaluation of the European  integration project, one must not overlook that the only  alternative, namely staying at the current status quo, would  certainly not be without problems and tension. The  globalization and professionalization of the money and capital  markets will continue to pose considerable problems and demands  for the central banks. A purely national orientation cannot  necessarily be seen as a viable strategy for the future, Gaddum  said.</p>

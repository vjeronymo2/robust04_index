			<p><P> November 23, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> COMICS DRAW JUICE FROM BIG ORANGE;  </P> <P> THE ORANGE COUNTY CRAZIES' LATEST REVUE TAKES HILARIOUS AIM AT SOUTHERN  CALIFORNIA FOIBLES.  </P> <P> No matter how bad things are, there's always hope if you can laugh.  </P> <P> So there must be hope for Orange County, because the Orange County Crazies are  generating a lot of laughs with their third and latest revue, "It's Not Easy  Bein' Orange."  </P> <P> Under the direction of Cherie Kerr, this intrepid troupe of 12 comics takes  aim, in a series of 16 skits, at our Southern California foibles. Many of the  targets are well-chosen, and even though the writing sometimes misfires, the  audience never escapes with less than a smile.  </P> <P> And sometimes the jokes are killers.  </P> <P> There's a skit about women addicts hooked on shoulder pads that is hugely  funny, not only in design, but in execution by Dee Dee Hanson and Lauri  Johnson. Hanson seems possessed -- her face is a seismograph of demonic delight  as she stuffs some very unlikely padding into her bulging jacket. And Johnson  has the furtive, hangdog look of one exhausted by her fashion excesses.  </P> <P> Johnson and Hanson have other shining moments as tacky lounge singers and heads  of state, where they are ably abetted by Lori Sidwell, Martina Lestico, Anji  Limon and, especially, LizAnne, who creates a deliciously sentimental Imelda  Marcos and an unsightly but ever-hopeful dating-service candidate.  </P> <P> The gentlemen aren't quite as on target as the ladies, although the Dudes skit  excels for pure foolishness, and Bob Harker, Ron Ruhman and Michael Lipoma make  for three very silly surfer boys. Lenny Fox, who opens the show as a wistfully  singing orange, brings some sly fun to his impersonation of Walter Cronkite.  Jon Cianci's plastic face and oversized amiability translate hilariously into a  sleazy judge and a nerd on the make, while Matt Liffreing helps start the show  with a bang as a freeway-blowout victim stymied by automated phone service.  </P> <P> But the Crazies are a company first, and as a company, they are hard-working  and likable, a various and well-matched assortment of people who want to make  you laugh. And do.  </P> <P> Kerr's contribution to their success is probably off the meter, as she produces  and directs the show and writes much of the material. The musical interludes of  Alan Axelrod keep it all moving to rock-'n'-roll time.  </P> <P> After "It's Not Easy Bein' Orange" closes on Dec. 15, the troupe has a new  revue coming in early '91 entitled "Orange on a Hot Tin Roof." Hmmm. Sounds  like something that should stick around.  </P> <P> 'IT'S NOT EASY BEIN' ORANGE'  </P> <P> An Orange County Crazies production of an original satirical revue.

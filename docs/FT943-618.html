			<p>940928 FT  28 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Eastern Electricity in Pounds 160m power plant order Eastern Electricity has ordered a Pounds 160m gas-fired power station for King's Lynn, Norfolk, in one of three moves announced yesterday which, it said, underlined its strategy of becoming a leading independent electricity generator. The company is spending Pounds 10m to take full ownership of the 360MW Peterborough power plant, of which it already has 50 per cent. It has also reached agreement to buy part of the output of the Schooner gas field in the North Sea. The investments in the 340MW King's Lynn station, which it will wholly own, and the Peterborough plant will give Eastern about 2 per cent of the electricity generation market. The projects could take gearing to about 30 per cent in 1995-96, although this may vary depending on how Eastern finances them. The company is currently cash neutral. Eastern said yesterday that following completion of the King's Lynn station at the end of 1996, the gross assets of its generation division would be about Pounds 450m. It expects King's Lynn and Peterborough to contribute about Pounds 40m to pre-tax profits in 1997. Last year it made pre-tax profits of Pounds 177m. The King's Lynn project is a further disappointment for the coal industry following an announcement last week by a group of companies, including Midlands Electricity, that they are building a 750MW power station on Humberside. The King's Lynn power station, to be built by Siemens, is likely to displace about 1m tonnes of coal a year. Mr Doug Swinden, group strategy director, said that the project would provide a good return on the investment even if the price in the electricity wholesale pool were to remain at current levels. The peak effect of the station on group gearing would be 12 per cent in 1995-96 and this would then fall because of the station's cash generation. The acquisition of 50 per cent of Peterborough from Hawker Siddeley Management, a BTR subsidiary, will bring Pounds 175m of non-recourse debt on to the group's balance sheet. It will increase gearing by 21 percentage points in 1994-95. Peterborough made operating profits of Pounds 3.9m and pre-tax profits of Pounds 840,000 in the six months to March after starting full operation in December. Eastern expects to buy about Pounds 200m of gas from the Schooner field from Shell and Esso over the nine years from the autumn 1996.</p>

			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / The Edinburgh Summit: Paradoxes along the Maastricht road to Emu ECONOMIC and monetary union was the most important goal of the treaty of European Union agreed by leaders of the European Community a year ago at Maastricht. It is now among the least plausible. Emu was envisaged as the last of three stages, the first of which was a 'hard' ERM, with universal coverage and few, if any, exchange rate realignments. The ERM's current disarray may not preclude a move to some kind of Emu by the end of the century. But it does render almost impossible the earlier belief in the staged transition to Emu by all, or even most EC members. In view of its significance, it is perhaps surprising that strengthening of the ERM will not be found on the agenda of the Edinburgh summit. This is supposedly for fear of reviving anxiety in already fragile markets, but probably because agreement on reform is inconceivable. The planned path to Emu has become less credible, for three reasons. First, the treaty has not been ratified and, following the Danish referendum last June, may never be. Second, even citizens of the two pivotal countries of the European Community give far from whole-hearted support to Emu. The French voted in favour of the Maastricht treaty by the narrowest of margins. A majority of Germans display marked hostility to the notion of surrendering the D-Mark. The Bundestag has insisted that it will examine whether the pre-conditions have been met before Germany moves into any Emu. Third and most important, after almost six years with only one technical realignment, two major currencies - the Italian lira and the pound sterling  -have been forced out of the ERM. The Spanish peseta has been realigned twice and the Portuguese escudo once. Considerable pressure has also been imposed upon the Irish punt, the Danish krone and even the French franc. The ERM is, to the Bundesbank's delight, an adjustable peg exchange rate system once more. Its most stable element is a D-Mark zone covering Germany, the Benelux and Austria, which is not even a member of the Community. Formally, this alteration in the operation of the ERM does not rule out the Maastricht path to Emu. The treaty demands only that, prior to a decision on whether it can be included in Emu, each currency should observe 'the normal fluctuation margins provided for by the ERM for at least two years, without devaluing against the currency of any other member state'. There is still time for this requirement to be satisfied. Nevertheless, the presumption that a hardened ERM would lead smoothly to an EC-wide Emu has been exploded. The ERM has gone awry because the European economy has done so. After seven years of growth in the EC economy at 2.5 per cent a year or more, EC-wide gross domestic product grew by only 1.3 per cent between 1990 and 1991, is likely to grow by much the same amount between 1991 and 1992 and again between 1992 and 1993. Community-wide unemployment has also risen, from 8.4 per cent of the labour force in 1990 to 9.8 per cent in October 1992. There are three main reasons for the slowdown in the European economy. The first and least important is what has happened over the past several years to the global economy, principally to the US. The second reason is 'local difficulties' in major EC countries, other than Germany, principally too much private debt in the UK and too much public debt in Italy. The third and most important reason has been German unification. A real appreciation of the D-Mark was required, to facilitate absorption of resources within the German economy. The mistake of the rest of the EC was to fail to realise the implications of the Bundesbank's refusal to tolerate higher inflation. A D-Mark realignment or, better still, temporary flotation of the D-Mark would have been a superior method of bringing about the needed adjustment than deflation elsewhere in Europe. The aim of the past three years has been to harden the ERM as a step towards an Emu that would bind Germany, both politically and economically, into a European union. The paradoxical outcome has been to weaken the ERM and make more probable either no Emu at all or a narrow one, totally dominated by Germany.</p>

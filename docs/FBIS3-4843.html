Tokyo has no time to waste in settling growing economic  frictions with the U.S., International Trade and Industry  Minister Hiroshi Kumagai said in an interview with KYODO NEWS  SERVICE.    Kumagai said the basic framework of the Japan-U.S. ties as  "a  mutually important partner" remains unchanged.    The only change is that the alliance has become  "symmetrical"  after the end of the Cold War structure, the trade minister said.    The two countries have come to regard each other as "a  competitor" as economic issues were brought under a spotlight in  the absence of military and political issues as seen during the  Cold War era, he explained.    Under this relationship, "adjustment of economic interests"  by both parties naturally gets "more conflicting and intense,"  Kumagai said.    Kumagai confirmed that Japan-U.S. economic ties have become  worst amid slow progress in opening Japan's markets and the  unabated trade imbalance lopsidedly in favor of Tokyo.    In order to mend the soured ties that got more conspicuous  following the aborted trade "framework" talks in February, Tokyo  should urgently devise a way to "assuage the U.S. frustration  and the uneasiness," Kumagai said.    But he said Japan should not seek a breakthrough via such  ways as accepting a numerical target to gauge imports, noting  the step is unacceptable in terms of principle.    Kumagai said that for Japan to leave unattended its  "strikingly big" current account surplus would not be in the  interest of the U.S. and the global economy.    He said the situation cannot be explained just by the widely  used argument that the U.S. trade imbalance was attributed more  to problems involved in its investment and savings balance.    The biggest task facing Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa  after its first cabinet shakeup expected shortly is to formulate  viable and effective plans both in macroeconomic and  microeconomic fields, Kumagai said.    Tokyo, if it fails to handle the trade issue with the U.S.  properly, would most likely face "a barrage of sanctions,"  undermining the basic framework of the bilateral ties, Kumagai  said.    But he added Tokyo should not accept numerical targets by  succumbing to "threat of sanctions" used by some advisers within  the administration of U.S. President Bill Clinton who believe  in the "heterogeneity" of Japan from other major countries.    "Both parties have already confirmed where the summit of the  mountain is," he said. "Where to start climbing is what Japan  and the U.S. are groping for at present."    As one approach to break through what he terms "the  deadlocked ties," the trade minister endorsed the recent  proposal by the Foreign Ministry for setting nonbinding "effort  goals" in macroeconomic fields.    The proposal calls for reducing the ratio of Japan's current  account surplus against gross domestic product (GDP) to 2.8  percent for fiscal 1994 from 3.1 percent estimated in the  previous year.    Kumagai said Tokyo should clarify its stance that the 2.8  percent figure is not anything like ones subject to sanctions in  the event of the goal's failure to meet.    On auto trade issues, one of the most contentious and  thorniest points under the framework talks, Kumagai renewed a  call for the Japanese auto industry to compile a voluntary plan  to expand purchases of U.S.-made auto components and automobiles.    The trade minister said he understands that the auto  industry  has reasons to reject unreasonable requests from U.S. and other  foreign countries. But this does not mean the industry should  always keep a posture of not listening to them from the  beginning, he said.    The private sector "grows old enough" to work out ways to  settle trade problems on their own, he said.    The positive stance shown on this point by the auto industry  last week represents "a step forward" toward the ideal  situation, he said.    Kumagai said the trade ministry will also step up efforts to  improve a situation in government procurement, citing the area  as where the government has reach.    On possible U.S. sanctions against Tokyo over cellular phone  trade, Kumagai said Washington must be receiving "some signals"  from Japan indicating its willingness to solve the problem.    But he declined to comment on what kind of reaction the U.S.  is showing to Japan in response to its signals ahead of the  March 17 deadline for listing sanctions.    Kumagai said the Hosokawa administration was able to "honor  three of four bills" drawn by the previous government of Kiichi  Miyazawa--the Uruguay Round, rice market opening and political  reforms.    The other issue of ways to spur the economy is what Hosokawa  should do urgently now, he said.    Formulation of economy-boosting measures containing the  politically sensitive tax cuts and hikes is beyond control of  bureaucrats, the trade minister said.    These issues are exactly what would require a political  decision, he added, indicating the government should map out a  comprehensive tax reform within this year in line with the  coalition accord.</p>

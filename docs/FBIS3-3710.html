			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Zhengzhou, March 21 (XINHUA) -- Central China's  Henan Province has become the first choice of foreign investors  beginning to eye the vast interior of the country for more  economic opportunities.    At present, partly foreign-funded enterprises total 2970 in  Henan and actual investment used has reached 600 million U.S.  dollars.    Foreign capital has poured into the province from more than  50 countries and regions of the world. Investment scale has  been further enlarged.    Seventy percent of Henan's total joint ventures boast  foreign  capital investments from 5 to 30 million U.S. dollars.    Apart from funding the booming industrial and service  sectors, more and more foreign investment has been directed  toward infrastructure projects.    Zhengzhou Nissan Motor Co., Ltd., jointly funded by Japan,  Thailand and China, has become one of the province's biggest  profit-earners after introducing advanced technology and  management experience.    A large agricultural province with very few foreign-funded  enterprises only several years ago, Henan has rapidly expanded  its economic opening-up in recent years.    Rich natural resources, abundant agricultural products, an  ample labor force and preferential policies in utilizing foreign  investment have effectively pushed Henan to the forefront of  economic activities in inland China.    Henan's economic growth was six times the country's average  in the year 1993, which was also faster than that of the  developed coastal provinces. Its export trade volume also  topped that of interior provinces last year.</p>

Late yesterday, Carabinieri police acted on 12 preventive  custody warrants issued by magistrates in Reggio Calabria in  charge of the investigation into the Messina judges and  unidentified businessmen and Mafia gangsters opened last year.  The investigation, still under way, is based on testimony  provided by organized crime figures in custody who have turned  state's evidence.    The charges against La Torre, in retirement since December  last year, refer to his work when he was an assistant judge on  the Messina criminal appeals court. Judiciary sources said  today La Torre was allegedly corrupted by Messina Mafia clans in  exchange for issuing light sentences from the criminal court  bench and that Mancuso is thought to have worked to the benefit  of gangsters while they were detained.    In addition to the word of informants, said these sources,  the Reggio Calabria magistrates also possess documents  pertaining to the charges.    Aside from the Messina judges, arrested in their homes, two  of the 12 warrants could not be served because they were issued  for known Mafia figures still at large. Six others were  delivered in jail to suspected members of Messina Mafia families.</p>

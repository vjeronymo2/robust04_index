			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Hanson bucks bad news Internationally traded conglomerate Hanson saw its shares ignore some disappointing news and forge ahead as investors finally noted their recent underperformance. The company announced that it had been forced to drop the planned flotation of US toy maker Ertl because of poor stock market conditions. The news put paid to hopes that it would raise some Dollars 200m for a 63 per cent flotation. However, a large line of some 8m shares which had been washing around the market was finally cleared, and several specialists pointed out that the Hanson share price had underperformed the broad market by 7 per cent over the past quarter. Investment houses have been expressing their confidence ahead of full-year figures due next Thursday. Company broker Hoare Govett was in Scotland talking to investment institutions following a positive review and Lehman Brothers was discussing a buy note with clients. Hanson gained 4 at 237p, with turnover reaching 12m, the heaviest among leading issues.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Ivan Ivanov] </F>   [Text] Moscow January 24 TASS -- Russian Prime Minister  Viktor Chernomyrdin tried to dispel predictions that the  economic policy of the new government may result in  hyperinflation and said that the tough financial policy will  continue. He also hinted that the government may agree with  producers and trade unions on a temporary price and wage freeze.    "The tough financial policy will not be eased to any degree.  Let nobody count on that", Chernomyrdin told reporters before  leaving for Omsk on Monday.    "No radical turns are planned" in the course of reforms, the  prime minister said and added that the government would adhere  to the programme of transformations which was adopted last  August and approved by the president.    "Nobody has changed the programme of reforms which was  adopted last August 6 and approved by the president. No changes  were introduced to it when (Yegor) Gaydar came to the government  in September 1993. He accepted it and agreed with it",  Chernomyrdin said.    He also said that he does not plan to fully abandon  monetarist approaches to reforms. "But time has come to use also  non-monetarist methods in solving our economic problems",  according to the prime minister.    The latter include, in particular, agreements between the  government, trade unions and producers on fixing prices and on  "establishing for a certain period of fixed wages", according to  the prime minister.    "There are many other ways capable of improving the  situation", he added, but did not elaborate.    The prime minister denied press reports about his  contradictions with the president and said he had no  disagreements with Boris Yeltsin either on the course of reforms  or on the personnel policy in the government.    "I always agree the main, basic directions of the work of  the  government with the president. He has to know them and will  know them", Chernomyrdin said.    He objected to attempts to discredit the new Russian  Government even before it began to work and added that the main  part of the government had been preserved.    He also denied allegations that he faced opposition in the  government during 1993. "I am not a schoolboy. I would not  tolerate it. If they mean Gaydar and Fedorov, I believe they  had no problems working with Chernomyrdin", the prime minister  said.</p>

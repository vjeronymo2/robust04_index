He has added this was made  possible thanks to the recent visit by Alexander Watson,  assistant secretary of state for Inter-American Affairs. Camet  has also said the January inflation rate reached 1.8 percent and  that there will be salary raises in 1994.

The food sector grew by only  1.1 percent. Murillo said this prompted a compensatory effect in  the January inflation rate, which reached 1.84 percent.

The  representatives of such international corporations as Maruven  Inc., Mitsui, and Sauder Peru Copper Corporation have declined  to submit bids, because they have claimed the $75-million base  price was too high.

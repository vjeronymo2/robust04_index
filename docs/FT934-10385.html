			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Wm Low edges ahead to Pounds 21m - Growing competition behind food retailer's sluggish growth WM LOW, the Dundee-based food retailer facing growing competition from both discount chains and superstores, yesterday reported a modest 2.4 per cent increase in full year pre-tax profits boosted by two new store openings. Pre-tax profits edged up from Pounds 20.6m to Pounds 21.1m in the 52 weeks to September 4. Turnover increased by 6.4 per cent to Pounds 447m (Pounds 420m) mainly reflecting the opening of the new stores. However, on a like-for-like basis sales grew by just 0.5 per cent. The group acknowleded that several factors limited growth during the year including consumers' down-trading to cheaper products, low inflation and 'increased price competition in all sectors of the market and the continuing increase in new forms of food retailing.' Nevertheless, Mr Philip Spicer, chief executive, emphasised that despite these tough new trading conditions the group had been 'squeezed not squashed.' However, static or falling store volumes resulted in higher operating cost ratios both in the branches and in head office. As a result, net operating margins in the second half were 5.1 per cent compared with 5.9 per cent in the same period last year but 0.3 per cent ahead of the first half. Operating profits increased to Pounds 22.1m (Pounds 20.6m) but interest costs jumped to Pounds 992,000 (Pounds 1,000 interest receipts) after capitalising Pounds 2.32m (Pounds 3.03m) of interest on borrowings incurred to finance the group's development programme. Capital expenditure for the past year was Pounds 41.7m but is expected to be scaled back to about Pounds 29m this year. This expenditure will be partly offset by the estimated Pounds 9m proceeds from the sale of a retail park development and other disposals. The group ended the year with net borrowings of Pounds 55.5m, equivalent to gearing of 33 per cent. Earnings per share edged ahead to 28.52p (28.22p) and the proposed final dividend is held at 5.7p making an unchanged total of 8.4p. The shares fell 6p to close at 154p. COMMENT Wm Low is being squeezed at both ends of the fast changing retail food sector in the group's traditional heartland. The deep discounters like Shopright are going head-to-head on price while the superstore operators like Sainsbury, which are expanding in Scotland, can overwhelm on range. Although capital spending is being slowed pre-tax profits this year could fall to about Pounds 17m producing earnings of about 18.2p and a prospective p/e of 8.5, a significant discount to an already battered sector.</p>

			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / White House begins fightback against Whitewater allegations The White House yesterday began a fully fledged assault on the Republican party, charging that it was exploiting the Whitewater affair to cover up its own political shortcomings. Mr George Stephanopoulos, the senior presidential adviser, said on breakfast television of the Republicans: 'They can't run on the economy, they can't run on healthcare, they can't run on welfare, they can't run on crime, so they're trying to exploit this issue.' However, picking up arguments used by vice-president Al Gore on Sunday, Mr Stephanopoulos conceded that the White House damage control team 'created a lot more damage than it controlled'. The leading member of that team, Mr Bernard Nussbaum, the White House legal counsel, announced his resignation at the weekend. But Mr Stephanopoulos added that the president had ordered full co-operation with the independent Whitewater counsel, Mr Robert Fiske, and had created 'fire walls' to prevent even the appearance of improper consultation between the White House and departments of government. 'We're going to get back to work on the big issues, and let the special counsel do its work,' he said. This message was also conveyed on television by Mr 'Mack' McLarty, the White House chief of staff, and Mr Paul Begala, another presidential adviser. Yesterday, one prominent Republican, Congressman Jim Leach of Iowa, also warned his colleagues about loose talk of forcing President Bill Clinton from office, implicit in a weekend interview by Senator Phil Gramm of Texas. Mr Leach said: 'I think it would be very inappropriate to put forth the notion that the presidency is in jeopardy.' Mr McLarty said he did not think either the president or Mrs Hillary Rodham Clinton were aware of the controversial meetings between officials from the White House and the Treasury at which the investigations into the failed Madison savings and loan institution, at the heart of the Whitewater affair, were reportedly discussed. Mr Stephanopoulos insisted these briefings were perfectly routine. Mr Roger Altman, the deputy Treasury secretary, had previously held similar sessions with congressional staff and the media, he said. These sessions was first disclosed by Senator Al D'Amato, the New York Republican, members of whose staff attended Mr Altman's meetings, Mr Stephanopoulos said. Mr Joel Klein, Mr Nussbaum's deputy, has ordered White House officials to destroy nothing related to Whitewater until it is determined what is relevant to Mr Fiske's inquiries. But Mr Stephanopoulos conceded that a 'heavyweight', preferably with extensive governmental experience, was being sought to succeed Mr Nussbaum. A frequently mentioned name is that of Mr Charles FC Ruff, a former federal attorney. Editorial Comment, Page 21</p>

			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / International Company News: Unilever freezes managers' pay UNILEVER, the Anglo-Dutch consumer products group, said yesterday that it is to freeze the maximum pay scales of its 2,000 managers and assistant managers based in the Netherlands. The move reflects similar wage measures at some other Dutch companies and uncertainty about the outlook for the domestic economy. The company said that the wage freeze would be limited to managers in the Netherlands and would not be extended to staff at either its British arm or in other parts of the world. Of Unilever's 2,000 managerial staff in the Netherlands, around 600 will be directly affected by the freeze because they already receive the maximum salary in their scale. The other 1,400 managers will receive an as yet undetermined salary rise. Unilever has a total Dutch workforce of 9,500. A Unilever spokesman said that maximum pay scales for managers may be raised later in 1993, depending on the economic conditions in the Netherlands and the pay trend for similar jobs at other companies. Pay scales for Unilever's Dutch managers are normally raised on January 1. The spokesman said that the freeze 'has nothing to do with the situation at Unilever itself'. Last week, Unilever reported a 4 per cent increase in third-quarter net profit in guilder terms and an 8 per cent rise in sterling terms.</p>

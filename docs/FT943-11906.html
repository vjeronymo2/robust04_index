			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / Klockner investment cleared The European Commission yesterday decided not to block aid from the city-state of Bremen to Klockner Werke's steel mill. It argued that Bremen's investment in the rescue plan was 'identical' to that of a private investor. The Commission also ruled that capacity cuts to have been made at Klockner could be abandoned in exchange for the closure of a subsidiary of Arbed, the Luxembourg steel maker. Arbed is one of a group of companies which, together with Bremen, formed a consortium to rescue the bankrupt Klockner steel mill. The two decisions are likely to be viewed suspiciously by non-subsidised producers which have argued that the Bremen plan amounted to state aid.</p>

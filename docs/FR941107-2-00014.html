			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Foreign Market Value <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Surrogate Country Selection <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In accordance with section 773(c)(4) of the Act, we must, to the extent possible, value the factors of production in one or more market economy countries that (1) are at a level of economic development comparable to that of the non-market economy country, and (2) are significant producers of comparable merchandise. There are no countries economically comparable to Ukraine that are significant producers of magnesium. Accordingly, we considered as potential surrogates countries that are economically comparable that produce comparable merchandise. In these investigations, we have determined that aluminum should be considered comparable merchandise. Although the material inputs used to produce magnesium and aluminum are different, according to both U.S. Bureau of Mines and Department of Commerce experts, aluminum is comparable to magnesium in that both (1) are light metals in terms of molecular weight; (2) are electricity-intensive products; (3) are produced using an electrolytic process, and (4) share some common end uses ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  dye casting). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We have determined that Indonesia and Egypt are both economically comparable to Ukraine ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> see <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  October 21, 1994, Memorandum from the Office of Policy to the File.) In addition, both countries are significant producers of aluminum. Because we were able to obtain more information from Indonesia than from Egypt, we have used Indonesia as our primary surrogate. However, we have resorted to Egypt for certain surrogate values where values in Indonesia were either unavailable or out of date. We have obtained and relied upon published, publicly available information, wherever possible. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Factors of Production <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In accordance with section 773(c)(1), we used factors of production as the fair value benchmark for the U.S. price of sales of Concern Chlorvinyl-produced merchandise by Gerald Metals and MG Metals. In the case of U.S. sales of Zaporozhye-produced merchandise for which we did not receive factors of production data, a BIA margin was assigned using the higher of (a) the highest adjusted alleged margin cited in our initiation notice or (b) the highest margin calculated for a sale of Concern Chlorvinyl-produced merchandise. The factors used to produce pure magnesium include materials, labor, and energy. To calculate FMV, the reported quantities were multiplied by the appropriate surrogate values for the different inputs. (For a complete analysis of surrogate values,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> see <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  our calculation memorandum.) We then added amounts for factor overhead, general expenses and profit, the cost of containers and coverings, and other expenses incident to placing the merchandise in condition packed and ready for shipment to the United States. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To value the raw materials, we used publicly available information from Indonesia in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> UN Trade Commodity Statistics (``UN Trade Statistics <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> '') for January through December 1993 and the 1992  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Indonesia Foreign Trade Statistics. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  No adjustment for inflation was necessary since the 1993  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> UN Trade Statistics <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  for Indonesia reported data for a portion of the POI. For values taken from  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Indonesian Foreign Trade Statistics, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  we made appropriate adjustments to account for inflation. For one energy input, we used data from the 1992  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> UN Trade Statistics <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  for Egypt since the unit value from the 1993  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> UN Trade Statistics <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  for Indonesia was based on an extremely small quantity and appeared to be aberrational. The 1992 Egyptian value for this input was inflated to the POI. For one raw material, we used information from the petition as best available information because we were unable to find a value in either Indonesia or Egypt. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To adjust material input values to account for source-to-factory freight, we used Indonesia freight rates from a 1991 cable from the U.S. Embassy in Jakarta. ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Certain Carbon Steel Butt-Weld Pipe Fittings from the People's Republic of China <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (57 FR 21058, May 18, 1992). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To value labor amounts for production and packing, we used labor data for Egypt, as reported in the International Labor Office's  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 1993 Yearbook of Labor Statistics <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  because the labor value available for Egypt was more up-to-date (1987) than was the labor value available for Indonesia (1986). We adjusted labor wage rates to account for inflation using world price indices for Egypt as reported in the International Monetary Funds'  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> International Financial Statistics (IFS). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To value heavy oil and diesel fuel, we used 1993 data for Indonesia from the Energy Information Administration's International Energy Annual. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Although we are unable to adjust these values for taxes included in the published prices, they are the only data found for heavy oil and diesel fuel in Indonesia. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To value electricity, we used information for Indonesia from the Asian Development Bank's 1993  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Electric Utilities Data Book for Asian and Pacific Region. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because we were unable to find surrogate values for factory overhead from either Indonesia or Egypt, we used factory overhead rates from the petition. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We used the statutory minima of ten percent for selling, general and administrative expenses and eight percent for profit because no surrogate country information reflected percentages for those amounts that were above the statutory minima. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To value packing materials, we used data from the 1993  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> UN Trade Statistics <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  for Indonesia. Because information for certain packing materials was incompletely reported, we were unable to calculate a unit factor value for these materials. Therefore, we included data from the petition to account for the cost of these packing materials. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

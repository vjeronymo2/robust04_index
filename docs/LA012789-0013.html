			<p><P> January 27, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TOWER PAID $763,777 BY DEFENSE COMPANIES SINCE 1986  </P> <P> Secretary of Defense nominee John G. Tower disclosed Thursday that he has  received $763,777 in consulting and lobbying fees since 1986 from six defense  contractors but said that he has severed all ties to the firms and that his  decisions as defense secretary will not be swayed by past affiliations.  </P> <P> "There will always be people who will suspect anyone who has been formerly  associated with the defense industry," Tower acknowledged at the second day of  his confirmation hearings.  </P> <P> The former Texas senator promised to "bend over backwards" to avoid even the  appearance of a conflict of interest, and he said that he would remove himself  from decisions that could result in a former client's being suspended or barred  from doing business with the federal government. But Tower said he would  participate in other actions involving those firms.  </P> <P> He said also that he would take no part in Pentagon decisions on an Air Force  reconnaissance plane known as C-Fin, for computerized flight information  system. He had lobbied for the $100-million program on behalf of the LTV  Aerospace &amp; Defense Co., a subsidiary of Dallas-based LTV Corp., which paid  him $246,860 for his services from June, 1986, to December, 1988.  </P> <P> Tower said he had resigned on Dec. 1 as a consultant to the six firms and  insisted that he retains no financial interest in any of the companies. The  defense contractors are LTV, Martin-Marietta Information Systems, Rockwell  International Inc., Textron Inc. and the Washington consulting firms Hicks  &amp; Associates and Jeford-McManus International Inc.  </P> <P> According to Tower's financial disclosure forms, released Thursday, the former  chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee earned $528,200 in 1988 in  addition to his income from defense lobbying and consulting.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Did Non-Defense Work  </P> <P> The payments came from consulting contracts with non-defense firms, including  British Aerospace Inc., which paid him $104,166, and Maxwell Communications,  which paid him $153,334. In addition, he received tens of thousands of dollars  in payments for serving on corporate boards, writing and lecturing.  </P> <P> Tower testified Thursday that he had served primarily as a "sounding board" for  his defense industry clients on broad "political or strategic" issues, rather  than obtaining information on specific contracts. He said he gleaned  information from former colleagues in Congress, from officials of the Defense  Department and from other lobbyists around Washington.  </P> <P> He said that he was aware of allegations of illegal traffic in sensitive  military information arising from the federal "Ill Wind" investigation into  corruption in Pentagon weapons-buying, but he declared that all of his  activities were "within the bounds of law and ethics."  </P> <P> "It's just a general information-gathering process but never doing anything  that was illicit or soliciting classified information or highly sensitive  information from anybody in government," Tower said.  </P> <P> He acknowledged, however, that the Ill Wind investigation has uncovered a  "substantial problem" with illicit traffic in sensitive Pentagon data that must  be addressed "swiftly and decisively."  </P> <P> The federal inquiry already has yielded several indictments and guilty pleas  from companies and consultants involved in defense contracting, and the  investigation is continuing.  </P> <P> Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh, in a letter to the committee, said that the Justice  Department had found no evidence that Tower was implicated in the procurement  scandal.  </P> <P> Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, which  is considering the Tower appointment, said he is troubled not by the fact that  Tower had served as a defense consultant but by the number of firms for which  he had worked.  </P> <P> He suggested that, if Tower were to remove himself from decisions involving all  of his former clients, he could not function as secretary of defense.  </P> <P> Tower replied that the law requires him only to sever all ties to the firms and  told the panel: "I will have to stand primarily on my reputation as an honest  public servant."  </P> <P> Tower said he would support stronger "revolving door" legislation barring  public officials from going into highly paid industry jobs immediately after  leaving government; and he indicated support for a bill to require consultants  doing business with federal agencies to register and list all of their clients.  </P></p>

I view proposals for seeking a solution through military  strikes with a "great deal of skepticism," the chancellor said  at a conference on security policy in Munich today. It is also  difficult at present "to decide who is more culpable."    Kohl again warned the Croatian Government against further  aggravating the civil war in the Balkans. He regretted that the  Croatian Government had so far not made "the necessary public  statements." Those who change borders by violent means cannot  count on the Federal Republic to give aid for reconstruction  after the war.</p>

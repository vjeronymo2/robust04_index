Gro Harlem  Brundtland and her fellow prime ministers from Sweden, Finland,  and Austria have their sights set on a joint meeting with the  Parliament's elected representatives. The meeting is expected  to take place in Strasbourg on 19-20 April.    The timing of this obvious and unorthodox charm offensive on  the part of the applicants has not been chosen by chance. For  the meeting will take place immediately before the Parliament is  timetabled to approve the outcome of membership negotiations on  4 May and give the decisive go-ahead for EU enlargement. Some  260 of the Parliament's 518 members must vote "yes" to new  members.    The aim behind meeting the European Parliament deputies is  to  increase pressure on them so that they do not slow down EU  enlargement. By their mere presence the applicant nations'  prime ministers will also signal their interest -- not something  which today's EU members lavish on the Parliament.    "A stroke of genius from the applicants," one source at the  Parliament told AFTENPOSTEN. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / Survey of Devon (10): Less cream, more jobs - North Devon is working hard to promote itself THERE IS more to North Devon than cows, Clovelly (the area's most photographed picture postcard village) and cream teas. This is the cri de coeur coming from local councils, pulling out all the stops to encourage new industry to come to the region. The growth in unemployment in North Devon, according to its Member of Parliament, Nick Harvey, is the highest of any 'travel to work area' in the country. In fact, no big industrial companies have started up here since 1984, when the region lost its assisted area status. A reversal of this decision, which local organisations now urgently seek, would unlock the door to government help for new and existing companies, offer a carrot for others to come to the area, and give an entree to European funds for improving infrastructure. Geographically, north Devon (which is covered by two district councils, North Devon and Torridge) stretches from Bude on the Cornish border in the west, to Lynton in the north and Okehampton in the south. It is a small-business community. 'One of our problems, when it comes to attracting manufacturing industry, is that we're seen by too many people as the place where people come for a holiday, and we're not known for what else we have to offer,' says Mr Eric Dancer, managing director of Dartington Crystal, one of the larger employers. He believes, too, that the area is insufficiently competitive with other counties in what it has to offer, and he is forming a West Country development agency to attract new money in a coordinated way, identifying unemployment black spots and the action needed to improve them. It will also provide an umbrella for all the organisations at present involved in requesting assisted area status. If people contemplate coming to Devon, Mr Dancer says, they will now find that the local community district council and industrial associations will work overtime to make them welcome. Mr Bob Hall, North Devon District's chief executive, is committed to industrial development. He has just appointed Mr Peter Lyons as the council's first economic development officer, 'A year ago,' Mr Hall says, 'we saw a local pharmaceutical manufacturer - then American-owned, and employing 460 people - announce it was closing down. With a 15 per cent increase in long term unemployment in the area, and several other companies shedding jobs, this was a spur for us to get involved in economic development. We now have 30 to 40 acres of industrial estates lined up and ready to go.'( In fact the company was saved by a management buy-out.) Peter Lyons comes from a background of industry, not local government. 'I didn't want anyone from local authority,' says Bob Hall. 'I wanted someone who had held senior positions in business and manufacturing. What we have to do now is get the message through that north Devon is not as remote as some people think, that we're actually keen on seeing development and growth. With a budget of Pounds 50,000 it would be unrealistic to say we're going to make a huge impact, but we are committed to it and people should come and see what we have to offer.' What does the area have to offer prospective companies? A skilled and willing work force with a history of good industrial relations; available sites; low costs; a college providing training opportunities for local employers and small business start-ups; a pleasant environment, and improved road transport brought about three years ago with the opening of a new link road from the M5 to Bideford - although it is still necessary to improve the county's north/south road links. A project further to the south is Torridge's twinning with North Finistere in France. This is aimed, says Richard Brasington, the chief executive, at hard-headed commercial development, with both sides learning from each other's expertise in the industry and tourism fields. A shop in Finestere is already selling Devon products, seminars will be held this month and next in both countries - and Torridge has run a course of French lessons for those taking part. Links are being formed, too, with Rugen in North Germany, an Objective l Area in European regional development policies. 'Such a tripartite link,' Mr Brasington says, 'will potentially give us greater access to European funding for infrastructure development here.' He accepts the paradox that the area might be spoilt by bringing in industrial development, 'But we're a hundred light years away from that. We could comfortably establish six large new industries on industrial estates in and around our district without making any impact on the environment, and as sites are already allocated, it wouldn't be a question of encroaching on the countryside.' Mr David Pinney, the district planning officer, says the council will help if troubleshooting is needed with the water and highway authorities, and will act for companies as much as it can. 'It's all about positive planning and making things happen. If we can't get the economic side right, we can pick up and go home.' A company that has got it right and employs a large number of local people is Appledore Shipbuilders, acquired in 1972 by Langham Industries whose managing director at Appledore, Mr Jim Wilson, has raised a Pounds 12m turnover in 1972 to Pounds 28m last year. But it has lost big orders because of difficulty in financing guarantees and lack of government support. It really gets to me that this government doesn't take a more patriotic stance to help its citizens,' Mr Wilson says. Whatever the government is not doing, north Devon is certainly committed to encouraging manufacturing industry into its area. Peter Lyons would like it to have a single common identity to cover both tourism and industrial development promotion. 'We must think up something direct and meaningful and produce better publicity material for targeting overseas companies,' says Mr Lyons. 'We have to go out there with something to say.'</p>

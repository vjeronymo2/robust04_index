			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / Brazil and IMF put off stand-by accord talks SCHEDULED negotiations between Brazil and the International Monetary Fund over targets for the country's stand-by accord have been put on hold until the government can implement cost-cutting measures. Brazil has been unable to meet targets for cutting the public deficit laid out in the agreement, signed in January. A good bill of health from the IMF is fundamental for implementation of Brazil's accord with international creditor banks, since IMF funds are needed to supply part of the collateral for the debt repayment scheme. The government has offered a fiscal reform package, including a tax reform and simplification proposal and a series of constitutional amendments that President Fernando Collor de Mello says are needed before the administration can seriously reduce public spending. These efforts are hindered by the country's political crisis, as a congressional inquiry into corruption charges against the president's campaign treasurer may lead to efforts to impeach Mr Collor. Meanwhile, Mr Collor has asked the 'silent majority' to demonstrate its support for him by wearing the colours of the country's flag tomorrow . But a recent opinion poll in Sao Paulo, by Data Folha, showed that 65 per cent rated the president's performance in office bad or terrible, opposed to 12 per cent who characterised it as excellent or good. However, the apparently desperate gesture comes as a growing number of observers are predicting that Mr Collor can weather efforts to impeach him.</p>

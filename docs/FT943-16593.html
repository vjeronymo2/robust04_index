			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / Management: Desert Island Manager - Julia Cleverdon The 44-year-old chief executive of Business in the Community, the charity which under the presidency of the Prince of Wales seeks to involve companies more closely in the community, would not enjoy a lonely sojourn on a desert island. Renowned for her organisational skills and strong sense of purpose, she has too much to do to sunbathe on a beach. How would you keep yourself occupied? 'It would be a very great strain. I would probably turn to gardening, getting vegetables into straight rows. I would need to have some feeling of achievement - I could not go to bed and sleep well after a day just lounging on the beach.' How would you cope with loneliness? 'I would say my prayers and reflect on my family and comfort myself with a marvellous range of memories about them and my friends.' What additional item would you need for your beachside office beside a fax and a telephone? 'I can have a fax and a telephone? Well, that changes things. I would try to be in touch with people who are doing things. I would be ringing up the entrepreneurs who have come through our Community Enterprise awards, asking them how they were making a difference to their local communities. An additional item you say? I would have a dictaphone to try out my speeches because I normally never have time to plan them.' If you could take one person who would that be? 'My husband, John Garnett. The other person I would like to take would be my grandfather, James Windsor Lewis, a vicar of Aberdare in South Wales in the 1930s. I never met him but my mother says I am very like him, not least in the way we arrange our finances. He was a great taker-up of causes. I would love to talk to him.' One luxury? 'Photographs spanning the years of all the family and my children, Charity and Victoria.' One film? 'Four Weddings and a Funeral. I roared with laughter, after having had a former marriage myself.' One book? 'Trollope, Anthony rather than Joanna. Can I take the whole of his Barchester Chronicles? I adore the politics and the factions. They mirror the world that Business in the Community has to tread through. Life does not change.' Some music? 'Stirring Mozart operas, I think. I listen to one a week on my exercise bike which I use every morning.' How would you like to be remembered if you were unable to get off the island? 'As somebody who tried to invest in people. One of the most important leadership roles is to grow people. It is very much like gardening. You tend them and apply fertiliser. But sometimes you have to prune to make them grow stronger.'</p>

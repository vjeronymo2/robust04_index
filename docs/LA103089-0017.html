			<p><P> October 30, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NHL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> FUHR IS STILL SHARP DESPITE LAYOFF  </P> <P> Grant Fuhr was well-rested and eager to begin his season Sunday night at  Montreal, but his Edmonton teammates were very weary.  </P> <P> Although Fuhr showed early in his first game that he is still an outstanding  goaltender, the Oilers squandered a 2-0 lead and were beaten by the Canadiens,  5-4.  </P> <P> It was the fifth game in eight nights for the Oilers and they finished the trip  at 1-2-2.  </P> <P> Fuhr, who announced his retirement before the season, then changed his mind,  underwent an appendectomy just before the season began and missed the first 11  games.  </P> <P> The Canadiens didn't waste any time putting the 27-year-old Fuhr, a key figure  in the Oilers' four Stanley Cup championships, to the test.  </P> <P> Shortly after the opening faceoff, Sylvain Lefebvre went in alone, but Fuhr  made a fine glove save.  </P> <P> Rookie Martin Gelinas and Jari Kurri scored to give Fuhr a 2-0 lead. The  Canadiens scored twice in the last two minutes of the first period to get even.  </P> <P> It was 3-3 before Russ Courtnall scored on a power play at 8:23 of the third  period.  </P> <P> Buffalo 4, Boston 3 -- Clint Malarchuk is making the two goaltender system work  for the Sabres.  </P> <P> Malarchuk stepped in Friday night after No. 1 goalie Daren Puppa gave up four  goals in eight minutes and played brilliantly.  </P> <P> He came back in this game at Buffalo to play brilliantly for 55 minutes. The  Bruins scored twice in the last five minutes to make it close, but the Sabres  held on for their fourth victory in the last five games.  </P> <P> Boston scored first, but the Sabres scored four quick goals in the second  period.  </P> <P> Malarchuk had 38 saves, including two difficult ones after the Bruins pulled to  within a goal.  </P> <P> Chicago 1, Washington 0 -- The Capitals are playing excellent defensive hockey,  but they suddenly have no offense.  </P> <P> Trent Yawney scored in the first period at Chicago and the Capitals, 0-5-1 in  the last six games, lost their second consecutive 1-0 game.  </P> <P> The Blackhawks regained first place in the Norris Division.

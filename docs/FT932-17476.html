			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / Property package agreed for East THE German government yesterday agreed a compensation package for tens of thousands of people whose property was confiscated by the Nazis, or the communist regime in the former east Germany. The draft bill, which took nearly two years to draw up, will be debated in the Bundestag, or parliament after the Easter recess. However, it is likely to be referred to the constitutional court. Under the bill, those seeking compensation will be paid out of a fund supervised by the finance ministry. The fund, totalling DM12bn, will be financed in part by a tax on those who manage to get their property back. Over 1.1m claims on 2.5m land titles have already been registered. Fewer than 15 per cent of the claims have been settled. The delay in agreeing a final draft, and in settling property rights in general in eastern Germany has held back foreign investment and developers in the region, even though foreign investors have, under certain conditions, priority over restitution claims. Those who property was confiscated between 1935 and 1945, and between 1949 and 1990, can obtain compensation or claim restitution. No help is allowed for property expropriated by Soviet forces between 1945 and 1949.</p>

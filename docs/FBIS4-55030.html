			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Party leaders have drawn the first conclusions  from yesterday's election round. Kata Peli Nagy went to a press  briefing by the Socialists.    [Peli Nagy] To preserve, to renew, and to surpass -- these  are the guidelines for the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP]  after its partial victory yesterday; that is, to preserve the  values of the past four years and to achieve what the previous  government forgot to accomplish. So there will be no big  clearout, or even a little one. This was confirmed by Zoltan  Gal, leader of the MSZP parliamentary group.    The intention behind these tactics, according to the party,  is that the position of the left has to be consolidated during  the next four years and this can only be accomplished through  successful governing.    Talking about the more and more pressing coalition  questions,  Imre Szekeres confirmed that a decision will only be made after  the second round. However, he listed four criteria which will  form the basis of negotiations. The most decisive factor in  choosing partners will be to establish an agreement about the  first six months' government program, about the structure and  style of the new government, and on whether the other partner  will be able to accept that negotiations will have to be carried  out with the civil and interest protection organizations.    Szekeres announced that the MSZP does not regard Gabor  Kuncze, Viktor Orban, Laszlo Surjan, Jozsef Torgyan, or Peter  Boross as prime minister candidates of the MSZP. Even in case  of an absolute majority they would like to unite the country's  best forces. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / Haitian military's assets protected The US government will unfreeze the assets of the leaders and supporters of Haiti's military coup now that many of them are going into exile in Panama and the US. Washington also announced that as part of the arrangement to get coup leader Lt Gen Raoul Cedras to leave Haiti, it would rent his home and beach villa for at least a year with payment made in advance. US officials denied they were pampering coup leaders and their families. 'Our intent was to make Cedras' departure as smooth as possible and to hold down the level of violence,' Mr Stanley Schrager, US embassy spokesman, said in explaining why the US paid for two charter aircraft, one to take Gen Cedras and his immediate family to Panama on Wednesday and another to take 23 other relatives and associates to Miami, in addition to leasing his property in Haiti. The US military will thus be protecting Gen Cedras' property, preventing the kind of looting and destruction that happened at the home of former police chief Michel Francois when he fled to the Dominican Republic last week. Four US amoured vehicles were stationed outside Gen Cedras' home keeping away a jubilant crowd that danced and sang songs in support of exiled president Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who is to return to Haiti tomorrow. The assets of the coup leaders, which one US official said were 'tens of millions of dollars', were frozen in mid-1993 as the US increased pressure on the military to leave power. Some of the funds were raised through smuggling operations controlled by the military which circumvented the international economic embargo imposed on the country. Other assets, according to testimony given to the US Senate in early 1994, were acquired through drug smuggling operations overseen by the Haitian military. President Aristide had been given access to some of the money during his three years in exile, using it to bankroll extensive lobbying efforts in Washington.</p>

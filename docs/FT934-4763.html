			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / Observer: Not beyond our ken It's a good job you can't judge a book by its cover. Otherwise the rushed-out analyses of the UK Budget from James Capel, Credit Lyonnais Laing and UBS economic research units should by rights have been binned immediately. The UBS cover shows a tattered Ken Clarke trumpeting 'Hey Big Spender' - hardly appropriate given the nature of the measures he announced. James Capel's glossy goes in for a Christmas feel, with Ken as Mr Scrooge being handed - inappropriately enough - a piece of paper with VAT on it. But at least they escaped the wild fantasy dreamed up by the team at Credit Lyonnais; that shows Ken as Freddy Kruger, the cinematic monster who has knives in place of fingers, with the caption 'Nightmare on Downing Street'. Given City and public reaction to the Budget, far from presenting John Major with a nightmare, Ken seems to have offered him the chance of his first full night's sleep in ages.</p>

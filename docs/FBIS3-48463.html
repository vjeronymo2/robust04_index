The article quotes the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il as  saying:    "Our party is an invincible revolutionary party, which has  performed immortal feats in accomplishing the revolutionary  cause of chuche, enjoys unquestioned trust of the popular  masses, is united as steel-like ranks and is possessed of rich  experience and tested veteran leadership ability."    It further says:    The iron will and tested leadership ability of our party is  clearly displayed first of all in confidently leading our people  along the road of socialism, upholding the revolutionary banner  of the chuche idea under any circumstances.    It is a steadfast faith and will of our party to carry the  socialist cause to completion, holding aloft the banner of the  chuche idea, neither hesitating nor taking a step back, whatever  complicated situation may be created and whatever trial we may  face. Drawing a proper lesson from the collapse of socialism in  some countries and decisively refuting the abuses hurled by  riffraffs at socialism, our party is vigorously advancing toward  a bright future by displaying wisdom and bravery in turning  misfortune into bliss. It has developed and completed the  socialist idea of chuche and firmly armed the popular masses  with it and strengthened the driving force of the revolution,  the integral whole of the leader, the party and the masses, to  resolve all the problems arising in the revolution and  construction with its strength.    The iron will and tested leadership ability of our party in  leading the socialist cause of our era to victory is also highly  displayed in firmly defending the dignity of the country and the  gains of the revolution, boldly meeting the challenge of the  imperialists and reactionaries.    Last year, the moves of the imperialists and reactionaries  to  isolate, stifle and crush our Republic got more vicious than  ever before, which carried the situation in our country to the  extreme pitch of strain. When a touch-and-go situation was  created in which a war might break out any moment, Comrade Kim  Chong-il, our supreme commander, took a decisive step of  declaring a semi-war state to the whole country, all the people  and the entire Army and called upon all the people to meet the  challenge of the enemy in the revolutionary spirit and militant  stamina as was displayed in the grim fatherland liberation war.  Thanks to this principled and resolute struggle of the party,  our people and the officers and men of the People's Army could  boldly meet the challenge of the enemy and smash his aggressive  moves and honorably defend the dignity and security of the  socialist motherland.    The iron will and tested leadership ability of our party is  also displayed in vigorously leading the revolution and  construction to a constant upswing with grand aspirations and  ideal and without slightest stagnation and standstill.    It is our party's steadfast stand to continue the revolution  till imperialism will have been wiped out and the victorious  flag of socialism will be flying higher on this land. Hence,  our party is pushing ahead with the three revolutions,  ideological, technical and cultural, keeping a tight hold on  them, and is firmly defending the revolutionary principle, the  principle of socialism, under whatever circumstances.    Unprecedented miracles are being wrought and innovations  effected and grand monumental creations adding lustre to the era  of the Workers' Party are rising up in great number in our  country under the wise leadership of our party.    Today our party is exalting its pride of being a great party  leading the socialist cause along an ever-victorious road with  iron will and tested leadership ability entirely because it has  the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il at its head.</p>

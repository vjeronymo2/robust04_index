			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / Sport: Man who counts the champ's cash - Boxing Three years ago Panos Eliades had never been at a boxing match. Two years ago the Greek-Cypriot accountant would never have dreamt of flying to Las Vegas to watch Evander Holyfield regain the world heavyweight title from Riddick Bowe. Last month Eliades scarcely batted an eyelid when a deranged parachutist missed him by inches and landed in the ring during the Ceasar's Palace title fight. After a couple of years as the backer and financial manager of World Boxing Council heavyweight champion Lennox Lewis, almost nothing surprises a man whose day-to-day business as one of London's biggest insolvency practitioners makes him not unfamiliar with human vagaries. 'My accountancy colleagues couldn't believe I'd ended up being involved with boxing. You've normally got to be a semi-hoodlum cum ruffian to have the credentials to be a boxing promoter,' chuckled Eliades in the partnership's offices, an elegant Bloomsbury townhouse. However unconventional his hobby, like the rest of his profession, Eliades can add up. He is deep in negotiations to mount a Holyfield / Lewis fight next spring. It would be a heavyweight watershed, unifying the World Boxing Association and International Boxing Federation belts held by Holyfield with the WBC crown held by Lewis. It has the potential to be the richest bout in boxing's history. In sporting dollars it is a Superbowl. MGM are pitching hard for the fight to mark the March opening of its new hotel / casino complex. Its gaming area, wider than a 15-lane highway, will be the biggest in Las Vegas, and is expected to gross Dollars 305m (Pounds 205m) in the first year of operation. 'The Unification fight could be worth as much as Dollars 54m,' calculated Eliades. The final values will depend on pay-per-view income from the HBO cable tv network, but Lewis would be guaranteed Dollars 10m, with Holyfield earning 50 per cent more. As a co-promoter Eliades would be looking for a profit on the event and, as manager, 30 per cent of Lewis's purse - before expenses such as training camp, air fares and hotel bills. 'Don't just look at one fight. There could be three in a year and then you're looking at Dollars 15m annual gross profit which is good for any small business,' Eliades enthused. 'The figures in boxing are just enormous. 'Tyson is coming out of jail in 18 months. If Lennox can fight him whilst holding three belts, it will be the biggest ever . . . . Dollars 100m. Even the the nuns will watch that one.' Of course, one of the fascinations of boxing is the difficulty of getting even the most obviously desirable fight to the ring. Before the Holyfield / Bowe fight could happen a contender named Michael Moorer with a contract to fight Holyfield had to be paid Dollars 1.5m to step aside. It could cost treble that to make Moorer step aside a second time. There is also the sub-plot of one Michael Bentt. A first-round straight right to the jaw of Tommy Morrison on an October night in Tulsa earned Bentt the cardboard crown of the World Boxing Organisation's heavyweight title. Bentt was born in the south London suburb of Dulwich before moving to Jamaica aged six. With Lewis being British-born and London-based, the tabloid sports pages will soon be shrieking for an all-British 'unification fight'. After not having a heavyweight champion for a century, the land of the Marquess of Queensberry now has two. The painstaking human embroidery of making the deals is down to Eliades. 'A lot of boxing deals are never completed because the ego of the individual gets in the way. They are unqualified megalomaniacs,' he said, with the disarming frankness which has made him a breath of fresh air in boxing. 'There are disc jockeys acting as boxing promoters. I work on a handshake. People in the fight game say I'm mad. In boxing you can't even rely on a contract, let alone a handshake.' How, then, did such an innocent abroad find himself in such a position? As Eliades himself agrees, one has more chance of being struck by lightning than of 'owning' a British world heavyweight champion. Lewis was brought to Britain from his then home in Canada under an arrangement and contract instigated by financier Roger Levitt, recently convicted of a multi-million pound City fraud. Eliades was a neighbour and business acquaintance of Levitt. 'Levitt is one of the greatest salesmen you could find. Sand to the Arabs. I knew nothing about boxing, I'd never been to a fight. I wouldn't recommend it as a business venture to any client of mine and I didn't want to buy the contract. But I did, as a favour to Roger, who desperately needed out.' Eliades calculated his initial exposure at Pounds 200,000. By the time Lewis fought Razor Ruddock at Earls Court a year ago, the sum had swelled to Pounds 1.6m. 'I'll never forget it when Lennox knocked him out in the second round, I knew we were on the road to financial recovery,' he said. 'Being a liquidator / receiver, my job is to be pessimistic, not optimistic. I'm pleased to recover my outlay. Profit doesn't usually come into it. With hindsight it's been a fantastic investment but somebody up there must like me to let it turn out like this.' The boxer and the accountant make an unlikely pair, not least because Lewis is a foot taller than the diminutive Eliades. But it seems to work. 'When he steps out of line, he gets a slapping,' confides Eliades, tongue in cheek. 'Being world heavyweight champion sometimes he wants things done yesterday, but he's only a normal human being as far as I'm concerned. 'All this yes-champ, no-champ is the end. It did for Tyson and a lot of others in the past. When you earn Dollars 10m in one night its easy to start drifting away from reality.' One project the pair are committed to is a commercially-funded and run London school for inner-city teenagers who have been in trouble with police and other authorities. Team Solo will have pupils' fees paid by local authorities. Lewis hopes to spend around a day a week at the Hackney premises, which open next spring. 'We hope to make money from it but that's far from the only reason,' said Eliades. 'Most of these kids in trouble are black and many lack any kind of role model. Lennox hopes to provide that.' If he makes it past Holyfield next spring, Lennox Lewis will be in many ways a unique world heavyweight champion. British, preferring chess to night clubs, takes his Mum to training camp with him, and a manager whose cheques arrive on time. Boxing will never be the same again.</p>

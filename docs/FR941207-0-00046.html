This action requires inspections to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> detect cracking in certain oil coolers, and replacement of cracked coolers with serviceable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> coolers. The amendment also provides for termination of the inspections by installing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certain reworked and re-identified oil coolers. This amendment is prompted by reports of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cracking in the welded seams of certain oil coolers. The actions specified in this AD are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intended to prevent loss of engine oil due to cracking in the oil cooler, which may lead to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a forced shutdown of the engine.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Effective December 22, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of December 22, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comments for inclusion in the Rules Docket must be received on or before February 6, 1995. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 94&hyph;NM&hyph;199&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The service information referenced in this AD may be obtained from Jetstream  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Aircraft, Inc., P.O.

The CAA advises that it has received reports of cracking in the welded seams of certain engine oil coolers that are cooled by ram air. Investigation revealed that these oil coolers were welded  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incorrectly during the manufacturing process. These defective welds have been isolated to oil coolers manufactured by Normalair-Garrett Limited and having part numbers (P/N) 8248C000, 8439C000, and 8714C000. Such cracking, if not corrected, could result in loss of engine oil, which may lead to a forced shutdown of the engine.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Jetstream has issued Service Bulletin ATP&hyph;79&hyph;23, dated August 26, 1994, which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> describes procedures for repetitive detailed visual inspections to detect cracking in certain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engine oil coolers that are cooled by ram air. This service bulletin also describes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures for replacement of cracked oil coolers with serviceable oil coolers. The CAA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> classified this service bulletin as mandatory in order to assure the continued airworthiness  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of these airplanes in the United Kingdom.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Jetstream has also issued Service Bulletin ATP&hyph;79&hyph;24&hyph;10360A, dated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> September 4, 1994, which describes procedures for rework and re-identification of oil  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> coolers having P/N's 8248C000, 8439C000, and 8714C000, that are manufactured by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Normalair-Garrett Limited.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This airplane model is manufactured in the United Kingdom and is type  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certificated for operation in the United States under the provisions of section 21.29 of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable bilateral airworthiness  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the CAA has kept the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FAA informed of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the CAA, reviewed all available information, and determined that AD action is necessary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other airplanes of the same type design registered in the United States, this AD is being  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issued to prevent loss of engine oil that may lead to a forced shutdown of the engine.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This AD requires repetitive detailed visual inspections to detect cracking in oil coolers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> having P/N 8248C000, 8439C000, or 8714C000, and replacement of cracked oil coolers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with serviceable oil coolers. Installation of oil coolers that have been reworked and re-identified terminates the requirement for repetitive detailed visual inspections. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> actions are required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletins described  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> previously.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As a result of recent communications with the Air Transport Association (ATA)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of America, the FAA has learned that, in general, some operators may misunderstand the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> legal effect of AD's on airplanes that are identified in the applicability provision of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> AD, but that have been altered or repaired in the area addressed by the AD. The FAA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> points out that all airplanes identified in the applicability provision of an AD are legally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subject to the AD. If an airplane has been altered or repaired in the affected area in such a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> way as to affect compliance with the AD, the owner or operator is required to obtain FAA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approval for an alternative method of compliance with the AD, in accordance with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paragraph of each AD that provides for such approvals. A note has been included in this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> final rule to clarify this requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

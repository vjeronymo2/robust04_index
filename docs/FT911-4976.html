			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / Parliament and Politics: Lambeth connection Labour MPs were last night pursuing Mr John Major, the prime minister, about his residential connections with Lambeth - the London borough where he made his political debut as a Conservative councillor. In a cryptic response to a question in the Commons Mr Major explained that at the relevant time he had lived 'directly opposite' 14 Templar Street, the address said to have been attributed to him in the electoral register for the period. He said that by living opposite 14 Templar Street he had 'fully met' the qualification required by those seeking to become a local councillor. Just over 70 district health authorities replied to the survey carried out last month.</p>

[Begin Czerwinski recording] This does not mean that 51  enterprises have been closed down. It means that military  production has been moved from those enterprises, or will be  moved from them. Why do we have to do this? Well, there was a  time when our armaments industry was geared to production not  just for our army but also for the army of the Warsaw Pact. The  needs of that army, the needs of a global conflict and the  provisions for such a scenario were very, very much higher than  they are in the present defense doctrine, which only envisages  the defense of the country.    We do not intend to privatize this sector. We want to retain  proprietry control over these enterprises. Of these 31  enterprises 10 to 12 are in very good financial shape, a further  10 are improving. [end recording]    The minister imparted the information that the Ministry of  National Defense [MON] had, and has no intention of buying the  Czech Albatros training and combat aircraft instead of the  Polish Iryda aircraft. Let me remind you that two days ago the  MON refused to buy the 36 commissioned Irydas produced by  WSK-Mielec. The refusal was explained by, among other things,  the fact that these aircraft were not the training and combat  versions the ministry ordered and that their price was not  competitive enough.    The Mielec Solidarity spokesman announced that there will be  a protest regarding this matter.    [Begin unidentified Solidarity spokesman recording] I know  that Minister Kolodziejczyk is not opposed to the Iryda plane.  All that was said was that a training plane was not, at the  moment, needed by the army. I knowing the Iryda plane, and I  know that it is a training and combat plane. Following my  meeting with deputy minister Kuriata, Minister Pol intends to  meet Minister Kolodziejczyk. The problem, of course, is: Where  to find the means to purchase the plane?

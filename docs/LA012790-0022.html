			<p><P> January 27, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOCCER AGAIN TREATED AS SECOND-CLASS CITIZEN  </P> <P> The way the U.S. Soccer Federation has handled the current contract situation  with the players of the U.S. national team is typical of the treatment of  soccer in this country for years.  </P> <P> Congratulations to Paul Caligiuri and David Vanole for standing up to the  federation. They are two reasons why the team is going to Italy this summer.  Another sorry chapter in the history of American soccer.  </P> <P> PETER BARKS, Manhattan Beach  </P></p>

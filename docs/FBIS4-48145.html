			<p>BFN     [Text] The Lesotho Government delegation and  representatives of the Royal Lesotho Mounted Police yesterday  reached an understanding that the police representatives should  advise the striking police to go back to work and that their  demand for a 60 percent salary increase was not (?affordable)  for the government.    This follows negotiations between the two sides of the  strike  action by Lesotho Police for an increase of 60 percent in  salaries and 100 percent increase in allowances. Other features  of the understanding between the two sides were that the issue  of allowances was already being addressed by the government that  vehicles at the Ministry of Home Affairs should be returned to  the ministry.    The understanding also noted that representations by the  police did not accommodate the army and its officials. It was  agreed that any outstanding issues should be attended to through  the normal government channels. The negotiations between the  two sides were held in a very cordial atmosphere.</p>

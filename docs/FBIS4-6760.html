			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 22 (YONHAP) -- Defense Minister Yi  Pyong-tae declared Friday that the government would never allow  the formation of a private grouping within the military.    The declaration was contained in Yi's ministerial command  letter No. 3 to commanders and staff officers of brigades and  above. The missive was entitled "Solidarity and Harmony for  Stability of the Armed Forces."    The regular personnel reshuffle carried out earlier this  month involving top Army posts has rooted out "the problems  related to private organizations," the defense minister said.    Yi was referring to the April 16 shake-up in which eight  Army  generals who belonged to "Hana-hoe," a private organization,  were forced to retire.    Hana-hoe, formed by former President Cho Tu-hwan and his  group of Army officers, was instrumental in catapulting Cho into  power by helping to stage "a coup d'etat-like" action on Dec.  12, 1979, following the assassination of President Park Chung-he.    A kind of old-boy network, Hana-hoe reportedly wielded great  power within the military and meddled in the nation's politics  under the administrations of former Army generals.    But Kim Yong-sam, who was inaugurated as the country's first  civilian president in February last year, has systematically  purged politically minded members of Hana-hoe and other private  organizations in the military.    In his letter, Yi said, "if anyone was found to have formed  or attempted to form a private organization, he would  immediately be picked out and expelled from the Armed Forces.    "This basic principle will be applied to all forms of  private  organizations," he added.    All commanders, therefore, should carry out their duties  lest  any private organization hamper the solidarity or reduce the  combat capabilities of the Armed Forces.    Officers should make no further attempts to create a private  group. Even the term "private organization" should not be  mentioned in the military, Yi emphasized.    He said all officers, including those who once belonged to  private groups, should employ their abilities fully to serve the  country and their fellow Koreans.    Noting that talk about creating a private organization  always  stems from unfair promotion practices, Yi said promotions must  be based on an officer's ability as seen from three viewpoints  -- those of commanders, fellow officers and subordinates.</p>

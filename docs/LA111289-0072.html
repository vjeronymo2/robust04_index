			<p><P> November 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE CONSEQUENCES OF PORNOGRAPHY ARE TOO EXTENSIVE TO IGNORE;  </P> <P> LAW: THE CONSUMER OF OBSCENITY CONTRIBUTES TO THE THE DEGRADATION OF  INDIVIDUALS, HUMAN LOVE AND SOCIETY.  </P> <P> Recently, an indictment in Alexandria, Va., was brought to our attention. The  charges involved a group of men who had plotted to kidnap or purchase a young  boy for the purpose of sexually molesting, torturing and then murdering him.  The twist was that these men planned to film the whole ordeal for the sexual  pleasure of other like-minded citizens -- and for profit. They were producers  of what is often referred to as a "snuff" film. The tape-recorded words of one  of these men note, "I wanna do it one time before I die." The man was said to  be willing to find a boy as young as 12, but one who was 13 or 14 was "more  along my lines."  </P> <P> One is tempted to gasp, then shake off the feeling of shock and horror by  reassuring ourselves that the view expressed is that of an infinitesimal  minority, and try to forget it. Sadly, however, the consequences of hard-core  and child pornography are too extensive to ignore. Their cost to individuals  and to society is measured daily in our sexual-abuse rates. In America at least  one of four women is sexually assaulted in her lifetime. Conservative estimates  put the number of molested children at more than 1 million per year.  </P> <P> Behind these horrendous statistics of abuse are movies like "Bleed, Little  Girl, Bleed," "Young Girls in Heat" and "Kiddie Killer" that stimulate  fantasies of sexual mayhem. Understandably, the sad facts of sexual violence --  whether in the production or consumption of these illegal materials -- are  never mentioned in the sales pitches that hard-core vendors use to sell their  products.  </P> <P> As a nation that prides itself on defending the human rights of people  everywhere, we need a collective determination to eliminate hard-core and child  pornography. And such determination is not a challenge to the First Amendment,  which we affirm; opposition to obscenity and child pornography falls within the  protection of our Constitution.  </P> <P> Lately, we seem to have reached a national consensus on fighting the spread of  addictive drugs. There are, unhappily, many similarities between the realities  of illegal drugs and the realities of illegal pornography. With each purchase,  the "casual" cocaine user contributes to the murderous assault on Colombian  society and to escalating drug-related crime in the United States. Elected  leaders, at home and abroad, face death threats from cartels because addicted  Americans, through their purchases, provide money for hired assassins. So too,  in the world of hard-core and child pornography: With each purchase, the  "private" consumer of obscenity contributes to the victimization of other human  persons and the degradation of individuals, of human love and of society.b  </P> <P> To speak of obscenity and child pornography as we are doing here raises First  Amendment concerns for many people. It is a concern that we welcome, because we  are religious leaders who cherish and defend the First Amendment as the basis  of our religious freedom, as well as our freedoms of speech, assembly and  press.  </P> <P> But we need to point out that the First Amendment does not protect obscenity or  child pornography. The Supreme Court has ruled time and again that obscenity  and child pornography are categorically excluded from constitutional  protection. Why? Because they exist at the cost of another human person's  dignity and well-being, and in the worst cases, life.  </P> <P> Obscenity and child pornography, we might note, are not the only forms of  speech standing outside First Amendment protection. We are all aware that  libel, slander and the proverbial yelling of "Fire" in a crowded theater are  also prohibited.  </P> <P> The Justice Department has been criticized for its growing attention to this  issue in prosecuting obscenity and child pornography. In many cases, these  criticisms are the cry of an $8-billion to $10 billion-per-year "industry" that  is feeling the effects of appropriate government action. As persons committed  to human dignity and the common good, we are grateful for the Justice  department's efforts and diligence, and we believe most Americans share our  gratitude.  </P> <P> We believe that our nation is inherently opposed to the degradation or abuse of  any group of citizens. If we continue to pretend that illegal pornography is  just harmless "fun," we will do so at the expense of our national ideals. If we  ignore the abuse, degradation and victimization that occurs daily in the world  of hard-core and child pornography, we will do so at the expense of our  humanity, our conscience as a society, and most of all, at the expense of our  collective desire for a country that affirms the dignity of each person.  </P> <P> We believe that just as all people need to stand together to fight racial  discrimination, illegal drugs and other social evils, so now we must also stand  together against illegal pornography. It must stop; we must and can make it  stop, and the time to act is now.  </P></p>

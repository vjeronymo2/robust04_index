			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / PO management declares battle against status quo: Andrew Adonis talks to the chief executive about his determined drive for change Mr Bill Cockburn, the Post Office's outspoken chief executive, vowed yesterday to strike hard at the Treasury to gain greater commercial freedom for the Royal Mail in spite of the collapse at Thursday's cabinet meeting of plans to privatise the industry 'We're fighters not quitters,' the ebullient Mr Cockburn said of himself and his senior management. He dismissed out of hand calls for him and to stand down because of the high profile he and Mr Michael Heron, the Post Office chairman, had taken in Mr Michael Heseltine's campaign to win over Tory backbenchers to the cause of privatisation. Mr Cockburn is determined to sustain momentum behind the current Post Office review and to gain the Royal Mail greater commercial freedom. He wants in particular to slash the levy - estimated at Pounds 213m next year - which the Post Office has to pay the Treasury out of its profits. Anxious that the status quo should not become the inevitable consequence of continued inertia - as some on the Tory right might like, to prove they were right about privatisation - Mr Cockburn cited the government's July green paper, which came out in support of selling off 51 per cent of the Royal Mail but also listed areas where greater commercial freedom could be given if the Post Office remained in the public sector. Mr Cockburn said: 'We urgently need to squeeze as much juice as we can out of those bits of the green paper, on a case by case basis. Slow decline need not be the consequence of the decision to drop privatisation, but it will be unless we make real headway on this.' With pre-tax profits last year running at Pounds 306m, the Treasury levy takes the lion's share of the Post Office's spare cash. The levy has been rising sharply - up from Pounds 182m last year to Pounds 226m this year. Mr Cockburn said: 'This can't continue. We will be saying to the government: 'If you bleed us white, we will not be able to deliver a first class postal service.' That must mean leaving us with more of our profits to re-invest.' He pointed to a green paper paragraph which states that even if the Post Office remains in the public sector, its existing Treasury levy could be 'effectively set as a dividend in relation to prospective profitability'. Since the levy is about twice as large as a reasonable dividend payment, that implies a cut of about half for next year, leaving the Post Office with about Pounds 100m extra for investment. Mr Cockburn will have no difficulty spending the extra cash. 'We are planning to invest around Pounds 350m in the coming year, but to keep our existing service modern - with better sorting facilities and the like - we need to be investing between Pounds 80m and Pounds 100m more.' Talks with Mr Heseltine and the Treasury start in earnest in the next few weeks. Mr Cockburn will be citing two other suggestions in the green paper: That the Post Office could be freed from its overall capital spending limit. That the existing efficiency target for Royal Mail could be replaced by a direct control on prices, allowing the business to keep more of the gains from greater efficiency - although in practice price restraints would be bound to follow unexpected efficiency gains. Gaining greater control of money is only one of the changes sought by Mr Cockburn. He sees freedom to engage in joint ventures, and to develop new lines of business, as equally vital. He said: 'We are not saying we want to set up a chain of Royal Mail ice cream shops but we do need to be able to move into other areas of the communications industry, and have to be allowed to make purchases and forge joint ventures, on a case by case basis.' Some of the new activities envisaged by Mr Cockburn are core even to the existing mail business, such as trunk airline distribution systems to deliver international mail more efficiently. Others concern new communications technologies, notably electronic mail and printing systems enabling the Royal Mail to take on combined printing and delivery contracts for the corporate sector. Mr Cockburn cites the example of Sweden Post, the state-owned Swedish post office, which has bought concerns engaged in the electronic mail field. 'We must be able to provide our customers with a one-stop shop service, and be allowed to get into the new communications world.' For Mr Cockburn the progress of British Telecommunications is ever more galling. Barely a week passes without BT, which used to be part of the old Post Office, announcing a joint venture or an international scheme. By contrast the Royal Mail still needs government approval for all investments of more than Pounds 20m.</p>

			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / Finance and the Family: First for savings - Trusts top insurance Unit and investment trust savings schemes offer far better returns than their life insurance counterparts. Over 10 years, the pay-out on the top-performing unit trust was more than double that of life-related policies. A survey in Money Management magazine asked fund management groups to provide returns based on premiums of Pounds 50 quoted net of all charges. Savings schemes allow those who cannot afford to put in large, lump sums to gain exposure to equities through small, regular investments. They have been a feature of life plans for over 100 years but are a far more recent innovation for collective funds. The higher-charging structure of life policies contributes to the significant difference in returns. The top-performing fund for both unit trust savings plans and maximum investment plans (MIPs) - the standard type of long-term, unit-linked investment life policy - over 20 years is M&amp;G Recovery (not shown in the table); but investors in the unit trust received Pounds 152,159 after 20 years compared with Pounds 124,645 in the MIP. If they had chosen the best-performing endowment policy (Tunbridge Wells Equitable), they would have seen a pay-out of only Pounds 64,635. Comparison between collective and life policies is difficult, though. Unlike collective funds, endowments will provide some life cover and returns are tax-free. The latter is is not the case with collective funds unless they are held in a personal equity plan. Moreover, there are huge variations in performance between different management groups. The best unit-trust in the UK growth sector over 10 years  -Fidelity Special Situations - paid out almost double the amount offered by Save &amp; Prosper Special Situations, the lowest performer. Top-performing unit trusts tend to be specialist funds. Gartmore Hong Kong is a single country fund to which few widows and orphans are likely to have been attracted. A fairer comparison for a with-profits endowment, which is a broadly-based fund aiming for low volatility, might be with the UK general unit trust sector. Even here, though, the unit trust returns are better. Pay-outs from the top-performing endowments over 10 and 20 years (Swiss Life and Tunbridge Wells Equitable) were Pounds 12,312 and Pounds 64,635 but M&amp;G Midland &amp; General, the best UK general unit trust over both periods, provided returns of Pounds 14,390 and Pounds 135,220. Interestingly, the survey showed that the top unit trust savings scheme bettered those of investment trusts over five and 10 years, although the reverse was true over 20 years. Lump sum investments usually show outperformance from investment trusts. Since much of this has been due to a narrowing of the discount, investors in savings schemes have not benefited to the same degree. Investment trust savings schemes are also far fewer than unit trusts. The survey also covers five-year results for Pep regular savings plans. Re-invested gross income boosts the performance of Peps compared with collective funds outside them. But the gross income effect is negligible on overseas funds with lower yields.

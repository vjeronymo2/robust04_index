			<p>921019 FT  19 OCT 92 / International Company News: Pre-tax loss at Nokia deepens to FM277m NOKIA, the Finnish telecommunications and electronics group, has reported deeper pre-tax losses to FM277m (Dollars 59m) for the first eight months, compared with FM205m a year earlier. However, the figures disguise a strong improvement in the group's performance in the second four months of the year, when it achieved taxable profits of FM3m, compared with losses of FM229m for the same period a year before. Sales for the first eight months rose to FM9.96bn from FM9.55bn, underpinned by an 8 per cent rise in sales from May to August. Mr Jorma Ollila, Nokia president, said the turnround in the company's performance got under way in May. He attributed it to strong growth in sales and profits in both the mobile phones and telecommunications divisions, and to last November's 12 per cent devaluation of the markka. The problem area remains the group's consumer electronics division, which made a 'substantial' loss due to the recession and price competition. Mr Ollila said Nokia would earn an operating profit for the whole year, wiping out in the final four months the FM152m operating loss incurred in the first eight months.</p>

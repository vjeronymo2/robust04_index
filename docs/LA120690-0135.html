			<p><P> December 6, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TORRES SEEKS SUPER PANEL FOR WATER CLEANUP  </P> <P> State Sen. Art Torres announced Wednesday that he has introduced legislation to  create a regional "super agency" to oversee cleanup of the San Gabriel Valley's  severe ground water pollution, one of the worst problems of its kind in the  West.  </P> <P> In addition, at a South El Monte news conference, Torres (D-Los Angeles) said  he submitted a bill Tuesday to create an annual $20-million "superfund" to  finance cleanup of ground water contamination throughout California, including  the San Gabriel Valley.  </P> <P> A key issue in the region's lingering pollution problem is that no single  governmental agency has the ability to finance or supervise the cleanup, which  could cost hundreds of millions of dollars.  </P> <P> Torres said the legislation is needed because governmental and water  authorities "have been floundering."  </P> <P> Local water agencies, including the newly created Main San Gabriel Basin Water  Quality Authority, maintain that they could take the lead if they were granted  additional powers.  </P> <P> Linn E. Magoffin, head of the Main San Gabriel Basin Watermaster, which  oversees water rights in the valley, said of Torres' super-agency plan: ". . .  He has gone too far. His bill is a club. He's going to pound people into  submission. Based on my 40 years in the water business, it's not going to  work."  </P> <P> But Maxine Leichter, head of the water quality committee of the Sierra Club's  Angeles Chapter, said the legislation "is absolutely essential."  </P> <P> Earlier this year, a task force organized by Assemblywoman Sally Tanner  (D-Baldwin Park) and Rep. Esteban E. Torres (D-La Puente) recommended such  legislation.  </P> <P> "The citizens of the San Gabriel Valley deserve this kind of legislation,"  Esteban Torres said. "And I hope (Sen. Torres) will . . . shepherd it through."  </P> <P> But Tanner, who has long discussed the possibility of submitting super-agency  legislation, on Wednesday said she was stunned. "Totally politically  motivated," she said of the bills by Torres, who is running for the Los Angeles  County Board of Supervisors.  </P> <P> One bill calls for the super agency to be led by a 13-member board to be made  up of representatives including those appointed by water districts and the San  Gabriel Valley Assn. of Cities. The superfund would be financed by a tax on  industries and businesses.  </P></p>

			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): Aluminium price hits 4-year high Bullish charts and fundamentals, together with a quickening in the rate of depletion of London Metal Exchange warehouse stocks, yesterday combined to drive aluminium prices to four-year highs. The three months delivery position at the LME closed at Dollars 1,707.75 a tonne, up Dollars 36.25 on the day and Dollars 56.50 on the week. Traders told the Reuters news agency that rising physical demand for aluminium world-wide could mean that stocks of the metal would fall faster than had been expected. This view was supported yesterday morning when the LME revealed that stocks of aluminium in its warehouses had fallen by another 55,150 tonnes to 2,190,500 tonnes. That followed the announcement on Tuesday of a 22,150-tonnes fall and took the draw-down from the mid-June record to about 460,000 tonnes. Aluminium's strength stiffened the sinews of other LME contracts, most of which had drifted lower early in the day. Three months copper, after initially being helped up to Dollars 2,494 a tonne by merchant buying, sank back to test support at Dollars 2,480, where it held, closing Dollars 8 down on the day at Dollars 2,481.50 to show a total loss on the week of Dollars 53.50. The gold price resumed its slide at the start of the week but steadied a little later. It ended little changed yesterday after eagerly awaited US inflation data failed to give a lead in either direction. The closing level was Dollars 387.60 a troy ounce, down Dollars 5.10 on the week but Dollars 2.10 above the six-week low touched on Tuesday. After a week of erratic trading, in which the market was highly sensitive to any reports of rain in Brazilian growing areas, London Commodity Exchange coffee futures finished on a down-swing. The January position fell Dollars 93 yesterday to Dollars 3,505 a tonne, down Dollars 18 on the week but Dollars 155 above Wednesday's low. The US-based Weather Services Corporation said light showers were possible yesterday in the coffee-growing states of Parana and Sao Paulo, Reuters reported. Otherwise it thought that the hot, dry weather that has been discouraging selling on the futures market would continue. At the International Petroleum Exchange this week all eyes were focussed on the Iraq-Kuwait border, although dealers were in some doubt about what the market response should be in the event of an attempted invasion. An Iraqi defeat resulting in a change of regime, it was suggested, could lead to an early end to sanctions and might therefore be bearish for the oil market; while a withdrawal might prolong Saddam Hussein's regime and leave the return of Iraqi oil exports a remoter prospect than before. In the end the market seems to have decided that peace was bearish. The IPE's December contract, which had spiked to Dollars 17.33 a barrel on Monday, sank below Dollars 16 as tension eased. Efforts to wrap up a new world rubber pact failed after 10 days of UN-sponsored meetings here, the final assembly was told yesterday, reports Reuters from Geneva. Chairman Peter Lai said more negotiations were planned for Geneva starting February 6, 1995, provided all parties and the UN Conference on Trade and Development agreed to hold the third round. The existing 1987 agreement, due to expire on December 31, was likely to be extended by another year at a council meeting of the International Natural Rubber Organisation on November 28-December 2 in Kuala Lumpur, Mr Lai said.  -------------------------------------- LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS  -------------------------------------- (As at Thursday's close) tonnes  -------------------------------------- Aluminium        -55,150  to  2,190,500 Aluminium alloy      -40  to     25,520 Copper            +3,600  to    337,100 Lead                -800  to    367,775 Nickel              +180  to    146,772 Zinc                -575  to  1,235,100 Tin                 -295  to     31,640  --------------------------------------</p>

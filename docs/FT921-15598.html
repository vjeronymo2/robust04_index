			<p>920109 FT  09 JAN 92 / Ravenscraig to close with 1,200 job cuts BRITISH STEEL yesterday sounded the death knell for steelmaking in Scotland by announcing it would close its Ravenscraig complex in Lanarkshire by September with the loss of 1,200 jobs. Mr John Major, the prime minister, said he wished the company had been able to meet a pledge it gave in 1987 to keep the plant open until 1994, while Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, accused the government of walking away from the people of Lanarkshire. The plant's future has been in doubt since last year when its hot strip rolling mill was closed with the loss of 700 jobs. The area around the plant has been hit by almost 4,000 steel-related job losses in the past two years and unemployment is expected to climb to almost 20 per cent. People in nearby Motherwell and workers at the plant reacted with sombre resignation to the news of the closure. The government responded to the closure by announcing that it had decided to designate Lanarkshire as a special enterprise zone and was seeking the necessary European Commission agreement to the move. Businesses setting up on these specified sites will avoid rates and corporation tax for a 10 year period. Setting up the zone will involve spending about Pounds 50m in addition to the extra Pounds 15m the government is spending in north Lanarkshire this year and Pounds 25m pledged for next year. Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary, said it should secure 7,500 new jobs in the area over 10 years. The Ravenscraig plant has been politically controversial since 1959 when the Conservative Macmillan government decided it should be developed to form the hub of a manufacturing area making ships and vehicles. Despite investment of more than Pounds 400m in the 1970s, when the complex employed 13,000, Ravenscraig has been vulnerable to closure throughout the past decade. The closure is British Steel's most aggressive response yet to the UK recession. It is likely to make a loss of between Pounds 80m and Pounds 100m this year as a result of lower steel demand, increasing competition from imports and a steep fall in prices over the past two years. The company also disclosed that the recession had forced it to postpone plans for a Pounds 100m investment in a continuous casting machine at its Llanwern plant in South Wales. The plan to expand Llanwern's capacity was one of the main justifications the company gave in 1990 for the closure of the Ravenscraig hot strip mill. The main steel plant left in Scotland, the Dalzell plate mill, has had a question-mark over its future since last July when the company announced it planned to build a new plate mill at Lackenby on Teesside, in north-east England. The Hunterston deep sea port will also be closed with the loss of about 50 jobs. Mr Lang said British Steel's decision was 'hugely disappointing' though it could not have come as a complete surprise to anyone aware of the recent steep fall in British Steel's profits. He said he had pressed Sir Robert Scholey, the British Steel chairman, to make public his assessment of market conditions which justified breaking his undertaking to keep Ravenscraig open until 1994. Trade union leaders at the plant reacted with resignation to the closure. 'There was an inevitability about it,' said Mr Willie Twaddle, senior works convener at the plant, 'even though we were guaranteed to 1994.' Mr Donald Dewar, shadow Scottish secretary, said the closure was the result of 'British Steel's misjudgment and malice compounded by an abdication of all responsibility by this government'.

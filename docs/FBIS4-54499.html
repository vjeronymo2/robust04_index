			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ivan Bielik and Stefan Hrcka: "Partly Disclosed </F> Party Finances"]    [Excerpts] Bratislava -- Yesterday's second day of the  30th meeting of the National Council of the Slovak Republic  [NRSR] ended prematurely, owing to a deputies' boycott. Ludmila  Muskova (Movement for a Democratic Slovakia, HZDS) told the  plenum shortly after 1600 that deputies for the HZDS and the  Slovak National Party [SNS] had been discriminated against at  yesterday's meeting of the parliamentary culture committee  because they did not receive background documentation for a  discussion on the statutes of the Slovak Television Council.  [passage omitted]    Subsequently, a part of opposition deputies did not present  themselves during a vote and NRSR Deputy Chairman Peter Weiss  (Party of the Democratic Left, SDL), who chaired the meeting,  had to declare the meeting closed because Parliament did not  have a quorum.    At the outset of its meeting yesterday, the NRSR took note  of  the Slovak Prosecutor General's report on the state of legality  in 1993. [passage omitted] Subsequently, deputies decided with  final validity on the fate of the NRSR law of 18 February 1993  on the payment of the state compensatory allowance and child  allowances. The fate of this law has been undecided for more  than a year after, on 1 March 1993, then Prime Minister Vladimir  Meciar returned the law to the NRSR for another discussion  because it did not place families under the obligation to  furnish evidence of the level of their income. On 22 February  1994 the Slovak Constitutional Court confirmed the validity of  the law's return and Parliament therefore discussed the law anew  yesterday. Opening the debate on the law, Minister of Labor,  Social Affairs, and the Family Julius Brocka (who, as deputy,  had submitted the original draft) said that, at the time of its  submission, the aim of the bill was to speed up the drafting of  a new, more equitable, and more specifically targeted law on  child allowances. According to Brocka, the government has  already prepared the draft of such a new law and the law of 18  February 1993 has therefore lost justification and Parliament  should reject it. After polemical statements by some opposition  deputies, the NRSR finally abolished the returned law. [passage  omitted]    After the lunch break, the plenum elected by secret ballot  Jozef Kosnar (SDL) as chairman of the NRSR National Economic and  Budget Committee and Bohumil Kacmar (Democratic Union of  Slovakia, DEUS) as chairman of the NRSR Committee for  Agriculture, Forestry, and Water Management. Stefan Kvietik  (National Democratic Party-New Alternative) became chairman of  the NRSR Committee for Education, Science, and Culture, after  Marian Andel (SNS) failed in the vote. Parliament also elected  new members of its commission that deals with the problems of  the Gabcikovo-Nagymaros system of hydroelectric power projects.  Jan Weis (SDL) was elected chairman of the commission and Jan  Krivcik (Christian Democratic Movement) and Jozef Prokes (SNS)  were elected commission members.    Subsequently, at a closed meeting, the deputies assessed a  report on the submission of political parties' and movements'  annual reports on their financial management in 1993 and agreed  with its being made public. Of the 54 registered parties and  movements, 13 failed to submit their annual reports to  Parliament. [passage omitted covered by referent item] The  report states that, in contravention of the law, several  political entities did not announce the names of donors who had  donated one-time gifts with a value of more than 10,000 korunas  or a total of more than 50,000 korunas in the course of the  whole year. Parliament's report did not specify, however, which  parties did not meet this obligation. [passage omitted]    After the discussion of annual financial reports, Parliament  was supposed to vote on supplementing the parliamentary  commission for supervising the activity of the Slovak  Information Service. Because of the incident described above,  however, the meeting was suspended and is to continue today.</p>

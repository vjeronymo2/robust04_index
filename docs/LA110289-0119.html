			<p><P> November 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> QUAKE ROAD REBUILDING PUT AT $1.5 BILLION;  </P> <P> HIGHWAYS: CALTRANS WARNS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THEY MAY HAVE TO FEND FOR  THEMSELVES. PLAN OUTLINED TO COMPENSATE NIMITZ FREEWAY VICTIMS.  </P> <P> Caltrans Director Robert K. Best on Wednesday said it will cost about $1.5  billion to rebuild state and local roads damaged in the Bay Area earthquake and  outlined a proposal to compensate victims of the Nimitz Freeway collapse.  </P> <P> Best, testifying before a special hearing of the state Senate Transportation  Committee, said the federal government will cover at least half and probably  more of the state's rebuilding expenses.  </P> <P> The rest will have to be paid by California taxpayers, either through a  temporary sales tax increase to be considered by the Legislature today or out  of funds already earmarked for highway construction statewide.  </P> <P> Local governments, which will be faced with an estimated  $300-million-to-$500-million road repair bill from the earthquake, may have to  fend largely for themselves, he said.  </P> <P> Best said it will also cost the state between $300 million and $500 million to  complete a program to enable every state highway to withstand the strongest  earthquake imaginable.  </P> <P> It is crucial, Best said, for the state to move quickly to spend the emergency  federal aid because any funds spent in the next six months will not have to be  matched by the state. He asked the lawmakers to pass legislation that would  waive laws and regulations that can delay the design and construction of  freeway projects.  </P> <P> That request was opposed by the Sierra Club and the city of Oakland. But Best  promised that Caltrans would not abuse that authority if it is granted.  </P> <P> "If we are allowed to expedite, that doesn't mean we are going to slap on the  blinders and put our heads and noses down to the center line and just roar,"  Best said. "We will be going through a type of process that involves the local  governments, involving environmental groups and other interest groups that  legitimately have something to be said."  </P> <P> In other comments to the committee, Best gave the first details of the  Deukmejian Administration's proposal to offer victims of the Nimitz Freeway  collapse compensation outside of the courts' civil liability system.  </P> <P> He said the survivors and the heirs of those killed should be given the choice  of suing the state or applying for payments through a simplified claims system  that could include arbitration.  </P> <P> Best did not concede that the state would be legally liable for the collapse.  He said the courts found the state not responsible for the deaths of two people  killed in the collapse of a bridge in the 1971 Sylmar earthquake in the San  Fernando Valley.  </P> <P> But Sen. Bill Lockyer (D-Hayward), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee,  said he believed that the disaster could cost the state "hundreds of millions  of dollars" in legal judgments or settlements.  </P> <P> Lockyer said the state would have a "very weak defense, if anything at all," if  it is sued for the deaths and injuries on the Nimitz.  </P> <P> To keep the matter out of the courts, Best said the Deukmejian Administration  will ask the Legislature to enact the special reimbursement system, which would  be aimed at providing quick payments without the need for lawyers, who often  collect 30% or more of court-awarded liability judgments.  </P> <P> "What we are dealing with here is not a liability question but earthquake  relief," Best said. "Otherwise, you are dealing with people who may have  suffered very severe personal damages and the only mechanism open to them would  be the very arduous, time-consuming and, to some degree, uncertain tort  recovery system."  </P> <P> Best said he envisions a program under which the state would compensate victims  immediately for minor costs, such as the replacement of damaged vehicles or  lost income. Larger claims would be deferred for a short time and settled  through an arbitration process.  </P> <P> Providing quick and easy settlements for victims, Best said, would be "more  important than providing an open-ended liability scheme for people to try to  take advantage of."  </P> <P> In the Oct. 17 earthquake, with a 7.1 magnitude, the upper deck of the Nimitz  Freeway collapsed onto the lower roadway. Officials now say that 41 people died  in the collapse.  </P> <P> Engineers have offered a number of theories for the freeway's collapse, but the  leading explanation centers around failure of joints connecting the upper and  lower columns.  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 7, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'TOUGH LOVE'  </P> <P> Obviously, P. Lucius Sladek Jr. and Frank L. Burke, whose Dec. 24 letters  blasted Bill Cosby, have had radically different experiences with dishonest  and/or addicted children than I have had.  </P> <P> Having seen "open-minded and understanding" parents give unlimited support and  love in a frustrating and fruitless effort to help offspring salvage their  lives, I feel I can comment knowledgeably on the subject.  </P> <P> My well-meaning parents' never-ending efforts to help those who "strayed from  the mold" have drained and disrupted four generations; one after another, the  children and grandchildren were affected by the tumultuous household.  </P> <P> It is not easy to use the "tough love" method, but the survival of a whole  family must be considered.  </P> <P> M. ATTEBERRY  </P> <P> Torrance  </P></p>

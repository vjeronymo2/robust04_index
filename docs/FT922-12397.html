			<p>920418 FT  18 APR 92 / Arts (Radio): Annie Lennox tells all IT WAS Ladies' Week across the channels last weekend. On Radio 1 on Saturday, Annie Lennox 'told all'; we heard about her baby, but most of 'all' concerned her new album, Diva, and her old albums, when she was half of The Eurhythmics. Radio 2, also on Saturday, presented the immortal Joyce Grenfell, who had more to talk about and talked better - however she talked, for she had a great repertory of English voices, despite being brought up in America. She was my next-door neighbour in Chelsea, where her assimilated English everyday voice could suggest any one of her stage voices as necessary. And late on Monday, Radio 4 had Adelaide Hall in the first of six programmes. I can recall her from the 20s, a Broadway star, later a Paris cabaret star. Electronics works miracles with the human voice, and although she is nearly 90, we can still hear something like the same sound, - though like Joyce Grenfell, she too has grown English. Both Radio 3 plays this week were revived in memory of dead participants - a formula that might too easily sentence us to old-time revivals a dozen times a week. On Sunday, The Ballad of Peckham Rye, by Muriel Spark, with music by Tristram Cary, recalled Christopher Holme, the director, who died last year. Under his direction, it had won the 1962 Italia Prize. When Spark's Dougal Douglas (Frank Duncan) moves to Peckham Rye, disturbance breaks out at every level of local society. It's all treated frivolously, even if concerned with such serious things as blackmail, business, assault or romance, and it is not surprising that Dougal claims to be the Devil. Some metrical dialogue is sung, but there is nothing like a real song. It was fun with no cultural objective, and yes, it was nice to hear once-familiar voices like Denise Bryer and Vivienne Chatterton. But on Tuesday another memorial play, Visitors, the first play by Terence Hands, who died last year in an accident, brought very much less fun. Originally transmitted in 1984,it imagines the delusions of a senile man confined to a wheelchair (Harry Andrews, admirable as always), veering from romantic fantasies to a vision of death. It seemed sentimental and unconvincing. Listeners who like to be reminded what they enjoyed when they were younger may have a splendid time with Radio 2 next week (not that Radio 2 doesn't spend a fair time in that territory). Lunchtime Saturday, The Goon Show; Sunday (part of The Vintage Years) the Billy Cotton Band Show; Tuesday, George Formby - George Formby, Junior, that is, not the one they used to see when they were on leave from the trenches. On Tuesday, though, Radio 4 did a feature about a possible immortal we hardly know about, the Trabant motor-car. In A Legend on Wheels, Oliver Walston told how it was to buy a Trabant in East Germany and drive it to Cambridge. To be frank, one didn't learn much about the car, except that it has a two-cylinder two-stroke engine with the fuel-tank sited above it, a 'notchy' gearbox with four forward speeds and reverse operated from the steering-column. This was more like a Dylan Winter adventure than a motoring feature. The emphasis was on the awkward gear-change, the blue clouds emitted when the choke was in, the humiliation of being passed on the Autobahn at the 90kmh top speed. You might think that it would have the salutary effect of dissuading people from wanting to own one of these unfriendly motors. Not at all. Walston, having driven his home to Cambridge, set out at once to buy more - a station-wagon, a military version, and a de luxe edition with a Volkswagen engine.</p>

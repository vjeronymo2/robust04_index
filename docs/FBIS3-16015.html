He emphasized that  at the moment, Moscow is engaged to a greater extent in material  and technical provisions for the Black Sea Fleet. Disruptions  in supplying the fleet are due to the economic state of both  Ukraine and Russia.    The Black Sea Fleet commander evaluated the morale of  personnel as satisfactory and capable of ensuring the completion  of tasks set for the fleet. "This was tested in the  Georgian-Abkhazian conflict," said the admiral.    According to information from the Black Sea Fleet press  center, Admiral Eduard Baltin agreed with the assertion of the  television journalists that the fleet's dual subordination is an  unusual phenomenon in world practice. In his opinion, such a  situation does not create any problems for officers, as the  latter are subordinate to the fleet's command. However,  problems sometimes arise for the command.    The Black Sea Fleet commander expressed the hope that the  presidents of Russia and Ukraine will solve the problems of the  fleet in the near future, proceeding from the military-political  tasks facing it: "I am currently subordinate to two  presidents," stated the admiral, "and I concur with them on all  of my operational actions. As for some of the high-ranking  military, I have gotten used to some dissatisfaction on their  part. I think that the presidents will make the right decision,  taking into account the military-political situation and  economic possibilities. In my opinion, Russia and Ukraine do  not have great differences, and those that they do have will be  resolved by political means."</p>

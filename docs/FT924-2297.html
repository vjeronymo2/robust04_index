			<p>921214 FT  14 DEC 92 / The Edinburgh Summit: Good news for Nordic applicants - Enlargement NORDIC governments welcomed the decision to start the process of EC enlargement early in the new year. Formal negotiations are expected to begin with Sweden, Austria and Finland by the end of January and with Norway within a few months. 'The outcome of Edinburgh strengthens our chances of becoming a member of the European Union in January 1995,' Mr Carl Bildt, Sweden's prime minister, said yesterday. His trade minister, Mr Ulf Dinkenspiel, who will lead Sweden's negotiation, added: 'Conditions have improved radically. . . . We will have entry terms in good time to put to a referendum in 1994.' However, a poll published yesterday indicated that as many as 50 per cent of Swedes oppose membership, with 33 per cent in favour and 17 per cent uncommitted. Strongest hostility was among people aged 16-29 and blue-collar workers. Opinion remains more favourable in Finland, where a majority back membership. But in Norway attitudes are hardening strongly against EC entry. In the latest survey 54 per cent said No and only 30 per cent Yes.</p>

			<p><P> December 31, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> BUSH NEW YEAR'S EVE LOW-KEY  </P> <P> President Bush plans to spend a quiet New Year's Eve with his wife, his  daughter and two of his grandchildren at Camp David, the White House said  today.  </P> <P> The Bushes have not invited any outsiders to ring in 1991 at the presidential  retreat in the Cacoctin Mountains of Maryland about 60 miles from here, aides  said.  </P> <P> The President went to Camp David before Christmas. He has remained there  throughout the holidays, coming back to Washington only for one day to handle  paperwork. Bush plans to return to the White House on Tuesday.  </P> <P> Aides said they had no idea whether Bush will stay up until midnight.  </P> <P> Bush's low-key New Year's Eve is a sharp contrast from the parties that former  President Ronald Reagan annually attended in Palm Springs, Calif. The  celebrity-studded events were hosted by publisher Walter H. Annenberg.  </P></p>

The new acts of violence took place in Fortul, Arauca  Department, where five soldiers were killed, and in La Guajira,  where the rebels burned two tractors and one bus. The body of  Laureano Restrepo Rodriguez, a former councilman and ADM-19  debate chief, was found in a rural area of Yumbo, Valle  Department. The guerrillas released Tomas Devia Lozano and  Jorge Carmelo Perez Alvarado, candidates to the House of  Representatives, and Alejandria Mayor Jaime Alonso Cano, Sumapaz  Mayor Guillermo Leal, Santo Domingo Mayor Davisnel Delgado, and  Santo Domingo Council Chief John Jairo Duque. The Simon Bolivar  National Coordinating Board [CNGSB] had kidnapped all of them.  Boyaca Conservative leaders Hernando Torres Barrera and Victor  Manuel Buitrago and political leaders Vicente Lozano Fernandez  and Carlos Silgado Rodriguez still remain in the hands of the  guerrillas.</p>

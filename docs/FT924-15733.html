			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / Letter: When traders become 'speculators' - and who are they anyway? (1) Sir, Must we continue to endure the nonsense of hearing politicians and commentators describe currency fluctuations in terms of perverse speculators who undermine policies of virtuous governments and mount bloodthirsty attacks on weak currencies? Traders deal to make money or avoid losses, not to make expensive political points. It makes sense to sell a currency down to the level indicated by the fundamentals, but dealers have no incentive to sell below this point. Equally, pension funds and other investment institutions would be risking justified criticism if they failed to get out of currencies which appeared overvalued on the fundamentals. They have no patriotic duty to incur losses to maintain the currency at a particular level. Politicians who are fond of extolling the virtues of the free market are often less than enthusiastic when market forces deliver results which are not to their liking. Traders then become 'speculators' and enterprise becomes 'greed'. The French finance minister has even reminded us of the dire fate of speculators during the revolution. He would be better advised to threaten the return of the guillotine for supporters of such market distortions as the CAP. Until a single currency becomes economically and politically feasible, markets should be allowed to do their job.

			<p>930927 FT  27 SEP 93 / Job fears fall despite rising unemployment FEARS by British workers that they could lose their jobs over the next 12 months have slightly abated, according to the latest monthly survey by MORI for the Financial Times. Fear of redundancy or becoming unemployed appears to have decreased over the past few weeks, in spite of two successive monthly increases in unemployment and the possibility of job losses in the public sector because of the government's decision that any pay increases there must be funded by increased productivity. Anxiety over the possibility of redundancy peaked in July, according to the survey, when 51 per cent of those in work said they were either 'very concerned' or 'fairly concerned'. The downward trend began in August when 47 per cent expressed this view. However, in the period up to September 20 the figure had fallen to 43 per cent of all workers. Any increase in confidence could flow through to the housing market because job-loss fear is believed to restrain people from taking on big new financial commitments. The groups which had become more optimistic by changing their viewpoint most over the month were young people, women, part-time workers and people living in the north of England. The most anxious were the middle-aged, men, full-time workers and unskilled manual workers. Mr David Martin, editorial director of Industrial Relations Services, the independent pay and conditions group which commissioned the survey, said: 'The recent rise in the published unemployment figures, and the possible impact on public-sector jobs because of the public-sector pay freeze, have not apparently adversely affected individuals' fear of job loss.' MORI interviewed 992 adults in full- and part-time work. UK unemployment will continue to rise during the final months of this year before falling in 1994, according to the latest forecast from National Westminster Bank. The recent slowdown in economic growth has reversed the downward trend in unemployment, says Mr David Kern, NatWest chief economist. Registered unemployment fell for four consecutive months earlier in the year but has since risen by 4,300 in July and 5,800 in August. Mr Kern expects unemployment to rise by a further 20,000 this year, leaving the total 50,000 short of its January peak, but then fall by 125,000 in 1994, with the largest proportional falls occurring outside the south-east. The NatWest forecasts imply a modest fall in the unemployment rate, as a percentage of the workforce, to 9.9 per cent by the end of next year from the current level of 10.4 per cent.</p>

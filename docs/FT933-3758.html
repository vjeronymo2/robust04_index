			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / Finance and the Family: Group's Japan debut A NEW Japanese smaller companies investment trust is the first offering from the recently merged Henderson Touche Remnant fund management group, writes Philip Coggan. It aims to take advantage of what managers expect to be a Japanese economic recovery in 1994-95 and of a re-rating of Japanese small company shares. The manager of the new trust, William Garnett, already runs an offshore, open-ended fund - Henderson Horizon Japanese smaller companies - which was second in its sector over the five years to September 1 (source: Hardwick Stafford Wright). The trust is hoping to raise between Pounds 30m and Pounds 100m. The offer will consist of ordinary shares at 100p, with warrants attached on a one-for-five basis. The minimum investment will be Pounds 2,000. Applications for shares must be received by October 14 and dealings open on October 22. The existence of the warrants, which will trade separately, is a device designed to deal with the discount problem. Shares in investment trusts often trade at a discount to net assets. That makes it hard to launch an investment trust since, allowing for costs, investors are being asked to buy new issue shares at a premium. But the warrants will have a value which should compensate investors for any discount which occurs. The annual management fee will be 1 per cent, and 75 per cent of the management and interest costs will be charged to the capital account. Initial expenses will be capped at 4 per cent.</p>

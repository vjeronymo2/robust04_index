			<p>BFN     [Text] An IDF [Israel Defense Forces] soldier was killed,  a second soldier sustained moderate wounds, and two others were  lightly injured this afternoon by terrorist fire directed at an  IDF unit in south Lebanon. Our Army affairs correspondent Yariv  Ben-Yehuda reports:    [Begin recording] [Ben-Yahuda] Sergeant No'am Simha, 21,  from  Kibbutz Rosh Haniqra was killed this afternoon in south Lebanon.  Three other soldiers were wounded, one moderately and two  lightly. The casualties were soldiers in the Nahal Brigade who  were part of a convoy that was making its way to the outpost at  Beaufort Castle. The supply convoy consisted of a water tanker,  several trucks, and armored personnel carriers.    The road leading to the outpost is very steep, rising 700  meters above sea level. Before they reached the outpost, when  most of the unit was making its way on foot, the terrorists  fired antitank Sagger missiles and mortar bombs at the convoy  and the outpost. One of the soldiers was killed by a missile  and three others were wounded, one moderately and two lightly.    Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin reacted to the incident, saying  it was a painful incident but did not mean an exacerbation of  the tension on the northern border.    [Rabin] Unfortunately there was an incident, but this is not  an exacerbation of the situation. I cannot say that it deviates  from other incidents to date, only that the outcome is more  painful.

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Commentaries by Aleksandr Kinsburskiy of "Vox Populi" and </F> Sergey Turanov of the Economic News Agency]    [Text]    [Kinsburskiy comment:] The VP-AEN Service, in  accordance with NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA's order and with its  participation, begins its quarterly determination of the 50  leading and most successful Russian businessmen, indicating  their ranking (from 1 to 50) and the average rating which  establishes each one's "economic weight."    A preliminary list of 100 names included the managers (as of  15 April) of the largest commercial organizations--banks,  exchanges, funds, joint-stock companies, trading houses,  insurance companies, joint ventures, and so forth.    The extent of these entrepreneurs' influence was determined  by 50 experts--economics commentators of the leading mass media,  economists and analysts from scientific and information centers,  the managers of public economic organizations, and analysts from  a number of commercial structures. A 10-point scale, where "10"  is the maximum and "1" is the minimum evaluation of each  businessman, was used, taking into account their contribution to  the buildup of Russia's new market economy and economic power,  and the amount of capital under each one's control. A list of 50  leading Russian businessmen was compiled, based on their average  rating, in April 1994.    In analyzing the published list of leading Russian  businessmen, it should be taken into account that among the 100  "contenders" suggested for the experts' evaluation there were  mainly managers of the so-called new economic subjects. In other  words, in conformity with the intention of the survey, managers  in the state sector were not included in the preliminary list;  nevertheless, they continue to exert considerable influence in  the formation of Russia's new economy and they have vast  material and financial resources at their disposal. For this  reason, primarily representatives of banking and financial  circles, as well as trading and middleman capital, took part in  the "economic Olympics." Managers of enterprises that could be  included in the "production" category, such as S. Fedorov (9),  N. Bekh (10), V. Kadannikov (11), and others, make up no more  than 15 to 20 percent of the list.    At the very top of the "pyramid"--the first four places--are  financiers and bankers. But on the whole, representatives of  financial capital make up more than half of the most successful  businessmen. About one-third are stockbrokers and contemporary  traders.    Not all the experts were able to evaluate the economic role  of each person. In this connection, it is interesting to note  that V. Gusinskiy not only headed the list of leading Russian  entrepreneurs, but he was the only one to receive an evaluation  by the 50 experts--a unique case. The economic power of other  businessmen was determined with difficulty by one to 18 persons:  V. Vinogradov, M. Khodorkovskiy, V. Neverov, S. Fedorov, and K.  Borovoy by one person and V. Guchnik by 18 persons. It follows  from this that the role of those named above in building up the  Russian market is quite well-known.    [Turanov comment:] Rating Russian businessmen is a  very difficult task because of the lack of reliable information  on their incomes and the financial status of the firms they  head. The opinion of experts obviously was based mainly on the  image of the entrepreneurs and facts about the enterprises'  activity reported in the mass media, as well as on "lobby"  information. Nevertheless, the experts were equal to the task:  in my opinion, the results of the survey accurately reflect the  rating of the elite of Russian businessmen, both by personnel  and by firms.    The pattern of "elite" enterprises is completely in keeping  with the boom in banking activity in Russia--over half of the  leading businessmen are managers of major banks. Because of the  lack of development of the commodity futures market and stock  markets, just two commodity exchanges (the MTV of Yu. Milyukov  and the RTSB [Russian Commodity and Raw Materials Exchange] of  K. Borovoy and A. Vlasov) and two stock exchanges (the MMFB  [Moscow International Stock Exchange] of A. Zakharov and the  MTsFB [Moscow Central Stock Exchange] of B. Pankin) made the  list. The number of stockbrokers in the next list may be even  smaller--K. Borovoy is now engaged in the sale of commercial  projects in the "Molniya" NPO [scientific production  association].    Aside from banks, exchanges, and production, trading, and  diversified enterprises, the list also includes an insurance  company (ASKO, G. Duvanov), a telecommunications firm (RELKOM,  A. Soldatov), and an investment fund (A. Fetisov), as well as  firms engaged in the art business (the Dyagilev-Tsentr of Yu.  Lyubashevskiy), firms working in the financial markets  (Brokinvestservis, I Safaryan), and real estate (S.I. Realty, A.  Vulfov). Managers of the major auditing and advertising firms  did not make the list, although several candidates were  suggested for the experts' attention.    The three "whales" of Russian business were represented by  several persons--"Menatep" (M. Khodorkovskiy, L. Nevzlin, and V.  Surkov), "Germes" (V. Neverov and G. Keselman), and the RTSB.  They and the overwhelming majority of leading entrepreneurs are  in business in Moscow. Other cities are represented by six  individuals (N. Bekh of"KamAZ," V. Kadannikov of "AvtoVAZ," I.  Nakhmanovich of "AvtoVAZbank," O. Kantor of the "Yugorskiy"  Bank, I. Baskin of "Garant," and R. Kadyrov of the "Vostok"  Bank, although persons who were not Muscovites made up roughly  20 percent of those in the initial list. Such a low evaluation  of regional business is evidently objective and traditionally  associated with the concentration of financial and production  capacities in the capital.    It may be noted that the overwhelming majority of leading  businessmen, including leaders in the list, are not investing  large sums in building up their own image. It is acquired by the  large advertising campaigns mounted by firms headed by them.    The published list indicates the current rating. An analysis  of its dynamics will be no less interesting. Evidently, there  will be fewer average changes in the businessmen's rating than  the politicians' rating. They may be linked with the startup of  important projects and major advertising campaigns.</p>

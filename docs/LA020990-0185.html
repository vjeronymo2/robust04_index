			<p><P> February 9, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P. M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> AGRICULTURE WANTS BEE IMPORTS  </P> <P> The Agriculture Department wants certain import restrictions relaxed so honey  bees and bee semen can be imported from New Zealand.  </P> <P> James W. Glosser, head of the department's Animal and Plant Health Inspection  Service, said today that New Zealand "is free of, and has adequate defenses  against, honey bee diseases and parasites and undesirable species of honey  bees, so our import restrictions can now be removed."  </P> <P> However, Glosser said the proposed rule change would allow only non-stop  shipments from New Zealand to ensure the health of bees and semen entering the  United States.  </P></p>

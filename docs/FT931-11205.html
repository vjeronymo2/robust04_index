			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading HOPES of a cut in interest rates in both the UK and Germany, along with speculation that Denmark and France may leave the ERM, helped reverse Tuesday's decline in stock index futures, writes Joel Kibazo. But for a brief decline in the first 15 minutes of trading, the March contract on the FT-SE which opened at 2,839, moved ahead on the interest rate hopes and talk of the ERM withdrawals, pulling the underlying cash market sharply forward. Buying at the higher levels was seen throughout the day and was further boosted by a strong Wall Street and March finished at 2,889, a jump of 52 on the previous day's close and at a 17-point premium to the underlying cash market. Turnover was a reasonable 9,735 contracts by the close. In traded options, turnover improved on Tuesday's levels to reach 31,794 lots against 25,119. The FT-SE 100 option saw business of 11,877 trades. Among stock options, it was Hanson that led the league table. It had traded 2,064 contracts by the close. It was followed by Thorn EMI with turnover raeching 1,301 lots. Bid speculation in TSB ensured that the options had a busy day. Some 1,187 lots were dealt in TSB with the June 180 calls the busiest series with a total of 700 lots. Glaxo which traded 1,184 contracts and British Aerospace in which 1,101 lots were dealt were also busy.</p>

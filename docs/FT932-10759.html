			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Terror cover bill set to pass swiftly THE BILL which gives legal backing to the government as a 'reinsurer of last resort' in cases of terrorist attacks against industrial and commercial property in Great Britain started its progress through the Commons yesterday and will be published today. Since the Baltic Exchange bombing in the City of London in April last year the government has pledged to pay the difference in cases where the insurance company cannot meet a legitimate claim in full. The explosion at Bishopsgate last month prompted the government to speed the bill through parliament. The legislation has all-party support and is expected to go through all its Commons stages next Thursday.</p>

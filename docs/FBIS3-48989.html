			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] President Ion Iliescu met with a delegation of the  Romanian Social Democratic Party [PSDR] at Cotroceni Palace  today. The PSDR delegation consisted of Messrs. Sergiu Cunescu,  Constantin Avramescu, Radu Gheciu, Radu Dumitrescu, and Emil  Putin. Today's meeting was also attended by Ambassador Traian  Chebeleu, presidential adviser and spokesman of the presidency,  and Mr. Paul Dobrescu, presidential adviser.    After the meeting, PSDR President Sergiu Cunescu made the  following statement:    [Begin Cunescu recording] We presented our viewpoint on this  declared desire to conclude a political pact. We said that a  political pact can only be achieved between political forces  that are sincerely interested in moving along the road of  reform. We did not discuss issues related to the formation of a  new government but only to putting together a new parliamentary  majority. This parliamentary majority should only consist of  the groups from the Democratic Convention [CDR] and the  parliamentary group of the Social Democracy Party of Romania  [PDSR]. Since these two alone cannot put together a  sufficiently broad and stable majority, which should not be at  the mercy of several deputies who may occasionally decide to  change sides, we believe that another important parliamentary  group should also participate in this effort, namely the  Democratic Party (National Salvation Front) [PD(FSN)], which one  can count on as a reformist group. We cannot rely on other  groups if we want to achieve this kind of stability; maybe one  could take into consideration certain individuals from the  Romanian National Unity Party [PUNR].    Therefore, if this new parliamentary majority is put  together, we could proceed -- with this majority and the  respective parties -- to negotiate a political pact that  contains the principles and main actions for a more stable  political activity in the future. If such a pact can be  eventually achieved, then a second part should follow, namely  negotiations on a social pact with the important social factors  in our country, particularly the trade unions, students, and  other social sectors. Therefore, we are talking about two  documents: a political one, to be concluded among parties, and  a social one, to be concluded with the trade unions. There are  possibilities for reaching this goal, if the current majority  party shows the political will to move along these lines. In  order for this to happen, the majority party must accept certain  new things and other attitudes than the ones it is practicing  today.    The discussions also focused on the statements made  yesterday  by PDSR Executive President Adrian Nastase, who outlined his  conditions for such a pact. He raised the issue of the  observance of the Constitution. We agree with his point and  have always said that -- although we did not vote in favor of  the Constitution for various reasons -- we will observe it,  literally. As you know, we are in favor of a parliamentary  republic. The second condition he raised was the need to  observe the republican form of state. Again, we have no  objection to that, since we are republicans -- that is, we are  in favor of a parliamentary republic. Third, he raised the  astounding issue of the return of the nationalized houses to  their owners. He should not have raised this issue, but since  he did, we also discussed it and stressed that we will support a  law on restoring the nationalized houses to their owners, but  that this law will not be able to solve all cases from the very  beginning, just the most blatant cases. The situation should be  further dealt with gradually by successively promulgating new  laws that ensure that the tenants are never at a disadvantage  and are secure in their homes. All instances should be dealt  with individually in keeping with the justification and strength  of each case.    We also discussed various other political issues. We stated  that we plan to stand by our overall principles and will remain  faithful to the CDR, since we believe in it and actually  initiated it. From the various notes the president took of our  conversation, we hope that he retained many of our ideas and  that the two aforementioned pacts can be achieved.    We did not raise the issue of the government, which can be  an  outcome of later endeavors. The main thing is to put together a  new parliamentary majority. [end recording]</p>

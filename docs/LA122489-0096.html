			<p><P> December 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLD TIGHTENS ITS GRIP ON THE EAST; FUEL SHORTAGES PERIL SOME AREAS  </P> <P> Frigid weather chilled the Eastern half of the nation Saturday, overwhelming  homeless shelters, slickening roads with snow and keeping utilities and fuel  companies scrambling to meet the demand.  </P> <P> The continuing cold and accompanying snowstorms have been blamed for at least  80 deaths in 17 states and the nation's capital.  </P> <P> The Energy Department reported that the weekend cold snap has stretched the  nation's energy system to the maximum and created "spot shortages" of heating  fuels along the East Coast.  </P> <P> In Texas, three utilities had to institute "rolling blackouts" because they  couldn't keep up with demand for power, with Houston most seriously affected  with 150,000 without service.  </P> <P> Other utilities asked customers to conserve power and shut off service to some  commercial clients, and heating oil and propane were high-priced and in short  supply in some areas. Power was also in short supply in Virginia and Florida.  </P> <P> The harsh weather also forced homeless people into shelters in major cities,  sending many into transportation terminals and bank automatic teller machine  lobbies to seek warmth.  </P> <P> In the lobby of a Manhattan bank, young homeless men wrapped in ragged blankets  slept on a floor littered with garbage to escape temperatures that hovered  around 6 degrees. City officials said 9,197 people were housed overnight in  municipal shelters.  </P> <P> In all, 30 cities from Texas to Alabama established new record lows for  December.  </P> <P> The Red Cross in Miami prepared to open three of its hurricane shelters to  provide a warm haven for the region's homeless, and city officials planned to  open Bobby Maduro Miami baseball stadium, in a move that could provide shelter  for hundreds of stranded people.  </P> <P> The airports in Jacksonville and Gainesville closed Saturday because of  ice-covered runways and several flights in and out of Tallahassee were  canceled.  </P> <P> Record low temperatures gripped parts of Tennessee as the mercury dropped to 8  degrees below zero in Nashville, smashing a 117-year-old record of 10 below.  </P> <P> The morning low of 11 degrees at New Orleans was the lowest temperature ever  recorded there, as was a low of 2 degrees below zero at San Angelo, Tex.  </P> <P> Along with the hopes for a snowy Christmas in Georgia came a rash of traffic  accidents on snow-slickened and ice-covered roads and warnings to motorists  from state transportation officials who urged people to stay at home.  </P></p>

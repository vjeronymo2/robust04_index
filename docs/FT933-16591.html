			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / International Company News: COB punishes chiefs at Metrologie THE CHAIRMAN and former chairman of Metrologie International, the French information services group, have been fined by the Commission des Operations de Bourse, the Paris stock market watchdog, after an investigation into movements in its shares. Mr Alain Fraiberger, chairman of Metrologie, and Mr Roger Haddad, his predecessor, have been fined FFr300,000 (Dollars 52,219) and FFr350,000 respectively. They are the largest of the FFr950,000 in fines imposed by the COB on senior executives of Metrologie. The COB began its investigation following sharp fluctuations in Metrologie's share price at the end of 1991. It has criticised Metrologie executives for selling shares in the company in 1991 prior to the publication of a gloomy announcement about the company's financial performance. Metrologie said that Mr Fraiberger was appealing against the COB report.</p>

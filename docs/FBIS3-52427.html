			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Cairo, 4 Jan (MENA)--The Arab League has expressed  concern over a provision in the recent agreement between the  Vatican and Israel on respect for the de facto situation of the  holy places in the occupied territories.    In a statement released today, the Arab League said it is  afraid that this might be interpreted as an acknowledgement of  Israel's occupation of the Palestinian territories. It  emphasized the special standing Jerusalem enjoys in the Arab and  Islamic worlds.    The following is the Arab League's statement today on the  recent agreement between the Vatican and Israel on diplomatic  recognition between the two countries:    Although it regards establishing diplomatic ties and signing  agreements between states as a their right to sovereignty, the  Arab League General Secretariat believes that such agreements  should not ignore international legitimacy resolutions or  (?cause) injustice to third parties' inalienable and legitimate  rights.    In this respect, the League's general secretariat is eager  to  recall Jerusalem's special standing in the Arab and Islamic  worlds, an established fact that has been asserted by the Arab  League's numerous resolutions on all levels.    Regarding the provision in the agreement between the Vatican  and Israel to respect the de facto situation of the holy places  in the occupied territories, the Arab League secretariat general  expresses its extreme concern lest this would be interpreted as  recognition of the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian  territory. If we take into consideration that the Vatican has  always adopted a firm stand consistent with the resolutions of  the United Nations and international legitimacy on the question  of rejecting Israeli sovereignty over the holy city and not  changing its historic and cultural status, this new position  demands that we emphasize our eagerness that this should not  affect the status of Jerusalem. Jerusalem is an extremely  sensitive issue for all the believers in the world. There is no  doubt that based on its long history, which has been  characterized by objectivity and fairness regarding the issue of  Jerusalem, the Vatican will take all these factors into  consideration so that peace and stability can be restored in the  city of peace so it can remain a glowing symbol of coexistence  and tolerance among the heavenly religions.</p>

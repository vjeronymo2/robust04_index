			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / International Company News: Email to pay Dollars A326m for NCL businesses EMAIL, the Australian white goods and building products group, is to pay ADollars 326.5m (USDollars 220.3m) for a number of buildings products businesses from National Consolidated (NCL). NCL, part of the troubled Adsteam group, said the sale price, which was subject to adjustments, would yield the company a book profit of about Dollars A132m. This would be used to reduce borrowings. The NCL divisions, which have been on the market for some months, include a number of prominent building product brands. Email said the businesses acquired were expected to have sales of Dollars 310m, and earnings before interest and tax of Dollars 28m. The businesses to be sold are Dorf Industries, Ogden Industries, Whitco, Aluminium Extrusions, Australian Die Castings, Luke &amp; Singer, and Extruded Metals. The deal will lift Email's turnover to around ADollars 1.8bn. The effect on profitability and earnings per share is expected to be positive from the beginning, Email said.</p>

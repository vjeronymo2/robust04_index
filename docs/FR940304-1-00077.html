			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> When these rates were applied to Whirlpool Corporation's estimates, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resulting weighted-average, real, after-tax rate incurred by consumers in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appliance purchases was approximately 6 percent. The Department, then, used 6  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent for the consumer discount rate in the analyses, with sensitivities at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4 and 10 percent. The Department believes that this range of discount  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sensitivities will capture the real, after-tax rates that consumers encounter  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in financing the purchase of an appliance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department recognizes however, that there remains considerable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> uncertainty in this estimate of the average consumer discount rate. There are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> numerous possible financial interactions that could be involved in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purchase of an appliance. For example, a credit card purchase could be paid  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in full within the customary billing grace period, thereby being exempt from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> finance charges, and, in effect, resembling a cash purchase. This would tend  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to put downward pressure on the weighted-average range of purchase financing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> choices. On the other hand, a cash purchase may actually be financed,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indirectly, by an increase in credit card debt. This would tend to put upward  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pressure on the weighted-average range of purchase finance rates. Furthermore, this analysis does not take into account varying consumer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> perceptions of the value of reducing current consumption in favor of longer-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> term financial gains. For these reasons, the Department continues to solicit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> data that might provide a more complete basis for the derivation of a consumer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discount rate used in these analyses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Furthermore, while financing rates may indicate the direct financial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impact to consumers of an investment in increased efficiency, they do not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reflect either other types of investments available to them, or varying  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consumer perceptions of the value of reducing current consumption in favor of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> longer-term financial gains. For example, what value of energy savings does a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consumer need to receive from an investment in an energy efficient  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> refrigerator in order to justify reducing savings, increasing debt, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> delaying the purchase of other consumer goods?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The costs of consumer financing does not indicate whether there are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> similar investment opportunities, available to most consumers, that produce  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> higher rates of return. For example, are there home improvements or other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> investments that could be made by most consumers that would have higher rates  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of return than an investment in an energy-efficient appliance? Also, a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consumer discount rate based on consumer financing expenses does not fully  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> account for the risks of individual consumer investments in improved appliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> efficiency. For example, the actual rates of return experienced by individual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consumers may vary widely depending on energy prices, appliance usage and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> useful life.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some have argued that implicit discount rates estimated through an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> examination of actual consumer purchases of appliances and related consumer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment would be a better basis for the consumer discount rate used under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this program. Various studies have indicated that these implicit discount  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rates range from 3 percent to as high as 100 percent (or more) for certain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appliances. However, because implicit discount rates are based on actual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consumer purchase behavior, they also reflect the extent to which the numerous  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> potential market failures in energy efficiency investments occur, such as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inadequate information, conflicting owner/renter incentives, and second party  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (builder/contractor) purchases. One of the major reasons why Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appliance efficiency standards were originally established was to overcome  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these market failures regarding investment in energy efficiency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Consequently, DOE does not believe unadjusted (i.e., not corrected for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> potential biases) discount rates derived from actual consumer behavior should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be used in evaluating the economic impact of proposed standards on consumers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This conclusion appears to be supported by court rulings affecting the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program. In  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Natural Resources Defense Council  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Herrington,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 768 F.2d 1355,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1406 (DC Cir. 1985), the court stated that ``the entire point of a mandatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program was to change consumer behavior'' and ``the fact that consumers demand  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> short payback periods was itself a major cause of the market failure that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Congress hoped to correct.'' The Department believes that the intent of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> legislation which established the appliance standards program is to achieve  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> energy savings which are being foregone because of market failures which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distort consumer decision-making (and behavior) from investing in energy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> efficiency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, if information were available on the implicit discount rates  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> revealed by consumer decision-making in the absence of any significant market-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> failure biases, it might provide a better basis for the discount rates to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used in assessing the impacts on consumers of proposed appliance efficiency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards. Another approach might be to examine the rate of return consumers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would require from other fixed investments of comparable risk and liquidity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department solicits information on the results of any analyses that could  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> support the derivation of discount rates using either of these approaches.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

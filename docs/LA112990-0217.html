			<p><P> November 29, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: ROSEMEAD;  </P> <P> REPAIRS FOR DEAD OWNER  </P> <P> City officials are going ahead with plans to make about $3,000 in repairs to a  home although the owner is dead.  </P> <P> The City Council Tuesday voted 3 to 0 to solicit bids for the work on Helen  Wetherbee's home because she had complied with all the other requirements of  the city's "Handyman Program."  </P> <P> Wetherbee died a week ago, a program official told the council. "They wanted to  just be sure this thing got fixed once and for all," City Manager Frank Tripepi  said.  </P> <P> The repairs include repairing a patio roof and relocating a rain gutter,  Tripepi said.  </P> <P> Wetherbee applied about six weeks ago for assistance from the program, which  uses community block grant funds to provide home improvements for senior  citizens and handicapped residents who are financially or physically unable to  make the repairs.  </P></p>

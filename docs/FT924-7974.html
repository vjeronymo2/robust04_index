			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / The Autumn Statement - Comment: Chancellor tries to start recovery - Financial Times, Editorial Comment POLITICALLY, the chancellor of the exchequer did himself and his party some good yesterday. But he did so in intriguing ways. The spending package was resoundingly un-Thatcherite, for example, both in the appalling state of the public finances revealed by the chancellor and in its detail. It was full of gimmicks to help industry and the housing market, both causes close to the heart of Tory backbenchers. To add to their relief, careful news management had led many to expect more spending 'cuts' than were delivered. The element in the package most likely to cause political trouble is the ceiling of 1 1/2 per cent on the increase in public sector pay. Even complaints over this should be containable when things are as grim for the private sector as they are now, and are likely to remain. The problems lie elsewhere, in the bleak state of the economy and the certainty that managing the public finances will become hugely difficult, unless the UK economy recovers far more vigorously than now seems likely. Mr Lamont's macroeconomic policy judgments are defensible. In cutting interest rates by a further 1 percentage point, he has focused the policy loosening where, given the problem of the debt overhang and the long period of monetary stringency, it was best to do so. As for fiscal policy, he has continued to abide by the increases to spending plans made in more confident days, while doing nothing yet to increase revenue. The result: a public sector borrowing requirement, excluding privatisation receipts, forecast at 7 1/2 per cent of gross domestic product this year and probably at over 8 per cent in 1993-94. These numbers are horribly realistic. What the chancellor offers is certainly not fiscal stringency. The plans allowed for a real increase in total general government expenditure of just under 4 per cent between 1992-93 and 1993-94 and even for a real increase of 2.3 per cent in the new control total, supposed to exclude the cyclical element. The stringency is postponed to next year: the control total is supposed to rise by about 1 per cent a year in real terms between 1993-94 and 1995-96. The stringency also follows profligacy: total expenditure is expected to rise by 12 per cent in real terms between 1990-91 and 1993-94, while GDP will probably have fallen. No wonder the public finances are in a dismal state. The public finances are not all that looks dismal. What a difference eight months - and an election - can make to economic forecasts] In March, the Treasury forecast growth of 1 per cent in GDP in 1992 and of 3 per cent in GDP in the first half of 1993. Now it says GDP will fall 1 per cent in 1992 and rise by only 1 per cent in the whole of 1993. Even growth between the second half of 1992 and the second half of 1993 is forecast at a mere 1 1/2 per cent. This is a forecast for a recovery that will feel like recession, coming after a recession that feels like depression. Nor is only the outlook for growth disturbing. In March, the Treasury forecast a current account deficit of 1 1/2 per cent of GDP in the first half of 1993. Now, despite far lower expectations for the growth of domestic demand, the current account deficit is forecast to be 2 1/2 per cent of GDP in 1993. These all too plausible figures emphasise the importance of export-led growth and the risks in stoking up domestic demand via more fiscal stimulus. The prospects for a sustained and balanced recovery depend overwhelmingly on the response of inflation to the devaluation. The Treasury is optimistic on this score, forecasting the retail price index (less mortgage interest) up by 3 3/4 per cent in the year to the fourth quarter of 1993 and the producer price index up by 4 per cent. But wages matter most. If the gain in competitiveness is to be maintained, the real cost of labour must fall. The government has taken the bold step of limiting the rise in public sector pay settlements to 1 1/2 per cent. The private sector has to follow suit. If the private sector does not do so, the government may find its action on public sector pay a serious error. The chancellor notes that public sector earnings have risen by 20 per cent over the past two years, while those in the private sector have risen by only 13 per cent. But public sector pay had previously lagged behind that in the private sector. The government has now made itself the direct target for all protests about low public sector pay. If public sector pay lags too far behind the private sector's over the next year or two, there will be enormous pressure for a catch-up in the future. In the details of what the chancellor has proposed are various actions to lift the gloom of recession. Noteworthy among them are the temporary increases in first-year capital allowances for plant and machinery; the allocation of Pounds 750m to buy up empty properties for social housing; the release of Pounds 1.8bn in local authority capital receipts; the abolition of the car tax; and extra export credits. None of this is likely to prove immensely important. Nor is any of it particularly objectionable. But some of it represents a move towards the sort of short-term tinkering with taxation that would have been anathema during the Thatcher era. The inclination to match any powerful lobby with a fiscal goody needs to be resisted. More welcome is the determination to maintain ongoing capital spending. The chancellor and the chief secretary have reason to be pleased with the new top-down control over public spending if it has allowed them to keep within the earlier total for next year, admittedly a generous one, and impose sensible priorities on the allocation of spending as well. In the longer term, the most important innovation - apart from the new procedure for control over spending, the new control total and the new unified procedure for spending and revenue decisions, to be introduced next year - is likely to be the scope for a private role in public infrastructure spending. 'The key question,' says the Treasury, 'is whether the private sector is genuinely assuming risk.' The Treasury is right. This should not be public borrowing by the back door. Yet, in the end, it will not be for the details of public spending - and for the absence of the feared 'shock horror' cuts - that this Autumn Statement will be remembered. The question is whether the chancellor has crafted a package capable of delivering a recovery that will start to heal both the economy and the wound in the public finances. With the ratio of public spending (less privatisation receipts) to gross domestic product at 45 1/2 per cent of GDP and the PSBR, similarly defined, rising to some 8 per cent of GDP, the British public sector looks Italianate. Even with reasonable recovery, the prospects for the public finances look worrying and the spending rounds to come horrendously difficult. Without it, they look disastrous. The government is reduced to hoping that this time devaluation and monetary easing will lead to the kind of long-term economic improvement that has failed to occur so often in the past.</p>

			<p><P> August 19, 1989, Saturday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> INSECT REPELLENT MISUSE BLAMED ON LYME DISEASE  </P> <P> The fear of catching Lyme disease from tick bites is causing people to use  insect repellents in potentially harmful ways, the Environmental Protection  Agency reported Friday.  </P> <P> The EPA, which regulates the pesticides used in insect repellents, said misuse  of repellents could result in adverse skin reactions, headaches, mood changes  and possibly even convulsions or unconsciousness.  </P> <P> Only a "small number" of reports of ill effects have been received, but they  have prompted "concern that fear of Lyme disease or the use of repellents for  other biting pests may result in misuse or overuse of these products," the  agency said.  </P> <P> Cynthia Georgeson, a spokeswoman for S. C. Johnson Wax, manufacturer of the  insect repellent Off, said the company endorsed the EPA advisory because "it's  very important to have people continue to use these products properly."  </P> <P> The widely used insect repellent accounts for about 70% of the repellent  market.  </P> <P> Georgeson said that, because of the widespread publicity surrounding Lyme  disease, which is transmitted by deer ticks, sales of repellents are expected  to be about 10% higher this year.  </P></p>

He stressed in his report that Russia intended to  further maintain the Black Sea Fleet in a proper condition as  one of the most efficient armed units for the defence of its  southers borders. We shall do our utmost for turning Sevastopol  into the main base of the Russian Black Sea Fleet, Grachev said.    The Russian defence minister confered on the officers, who  showed especially good performance, the military ranks, that  were due to them, earlier than planned before. These included  the commander of the Cheleken, the hydrographic vessel that  transported hydrographic equipment from Odessa.    Grachev had to cool the temper of some angry officers at the  meeting. For instance, Colonel Lobov from the Air Force of the  Black Sea Fleet said that pilots intended to leave no planes to  the Ukrainian side, to take off without permission and fly to  Russia.</p>

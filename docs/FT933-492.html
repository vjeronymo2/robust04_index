			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / Venezuela natural gas pipeline explosion kills 51 A NATURAL gas pipeline exploded along a busy highway near Caracas yesterday, killing at least 51 people and injuring 15 while they sat in morning rush hour traffic, the Venezuelan National Guard said, Reuter reports from Caracas. National Guard Commander Vinicio Barrios, appearing yards from the charred wreckage of vehicles, told reporters that rescue workers counted 51 dead and 15 injured. The toll included 33 people incinerated in a bus that was stuck in traffic next to the pipeline that blew up about 40 miles west of Caracas, Miranda state civil defence official Cesar Leon said. 'The blast occurred over an area of 200 yards,' Mr Leon said. 'All of the people who were in this perimeter died instantly.' Construction crews using heavy machinery to dig up the ground accidentally struck the pipeline, causing a leak, according to one firefighter. Corpoven, the affiliate of state-run oil company Petroleos de Venezuela, said safety valves immediately shut gas through the line, preventing further damage. However, nearby homes were evacuated for fear of further explosions. Earlier officials had said the blast was the result of a crash between a car and a truck that had skidded into the pipeline.</p>

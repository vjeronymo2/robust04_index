			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Time for companies to ring the changes - Businesses have not caught up with increased consumer confidence over telephone use The telephone, as a marketing tool, has come of age. This may seem strange, given that the 'phone has been around for about 100 years and looks like old technology next to interactive superhighways and all the other communications developments on the horizon. But it is only now, according to a study* on 'phone potential for business in the UK by the Henley Centre forecasting group, that telephone technology 'has finally reached critical mass in terms of consumer confidence, use and attitudes towards it'. The trouble is, reports Henley, that businesses have not caught up with this development in 'teleculture': they continue to make customers hang on, subjecting them to unwanted music and then 'ping-ponging' them between departments. First Direct, Next and Direct Line are among the exceptions to have seen the potential for telephone-based businesses, says Henley. In the financial services sector alone, previous studies have suggested that as many as 30m calls a year are abandoned by customers who get fed up with waiting or who are met with unhelpful staff. Melanie Howard, Henley's head of direct marketing studies, says: 'The amount of business companies are throwing away must be enormous. We found, for example, that only 14 per cent of people would definitely call back if they couldn't get through when responding to an advertisement.' Overall, Henley reports that interviews with 500 senior managers across a range of sectors show 'there is little evidence that despite spending an estimated Pounds 10bn per annum on telephone contact, in sales, marketing or customer service functions, and employing nearly 1m dedicated telephone staff, that any more than a few companies are experiencing the real benefits reported by the more advanced users - increased customer loyalty, revenue maximisation and a competitive edge'. Evidence that the 'teleculture' has finally arrived among consumers in the UK ('phone usage in the US is about four times greater) comes from group discussions and interviews with 1,000 consumers conducted in March for Henley. As would be expected, professionals and more affluent households are more likely to enjoy using the 'phone and employ it to buy goods and services. However, individual attitudes to the 'phone cut across socio-economic groupings and are more significant in predicting usage, found Henley. Four distinct groups were identified: Telephiles, who make up 47 per cent of consumers, are confident and frequent users of the 'phone to do business. They are relatively positive about being called by companies, as long as they can see something in it for themselves. They agree more than other groups that they would buy again from a company that keeps in touch, that companies should check to find out if customers are satisfied and should ask consumers for their opinions of new products and services. Telephobes, 16 per cent of 'phone users, use the 'phone as little as possible and are more likely to be younger and more downmarket. Fewer of them work full time. They are particularly negative about receiving calls from companies. Functionals, 15 per cent of the market, do not positively enjoy the 'phone as much as telephiles but are confident and prepared to use it socially, at work and to obtain goods and services. Two-thirds of this group were men. Protectionists, 22 per cent of users, are, says Henley, 'people who are generally positive about using the telephone but who do not want a two-way relationship with businesses'. They see little value in companies keeping in touch with their customers or seeking their opinions, whether through the 'phone or not. Businesses greatly overestimate the resistance among consumers to the telephone, says Henley, and there is even evidence that dislike of 'cold calls' is receding. Nearly three-quarters of users say that getting an immediate answer on the 'phone is top of their list of priorities, yet most companies - even those with teams to deal with customer queries, and who are using advanced equipment or special telephone numbers - continue to put all calls through their general switchboards. Overall, Henley finds that, while consumer demand for good telephone services is high, customers' expectations are low. 'This suggests that businesses can relatively easily improve the service they provide over the 'phone, and to do so would have a very positive impact on consumers.' *Teleculture 2000.

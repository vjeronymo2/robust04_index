			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] With the conclusion of the latest multilateral  trade negotiations (the Uruguay Round), Japan is now committed  to giving foreign rice exporters minimum access to the Japanese  rice market beginning in 1995. Now, the United States has  informally asked the Japanese Government that American-grown  rice account for 40-60 percent of rice imported under the  minimum access arrangements. This was disclosed on 3 January by  a source familiar with Japan-U.S. trade negotiations. The  United States, which is trying to increase its exports of rice  to Japan, is believed to have made the informal request with the  aim of securing a long-term share of the Japanese rice market.  The government does not want to adopt a country-by-country  quota system for fear of drawing criticism from other rice  exporting nations. The United States is expected to press hard  for its demand in the future and the Japanese Government is  likely to face difficulties in dealing with the U.S. demand.    Japan has committed itself to partially opening its rice  market. It will have to import about 400,000 tons of rice, or 4  percent of domestic rice consumption, in 1995 and increase  imports to about 800,000 tons, or 8 percent of the domestic rice  consumption six years later.    The Uruguay Round multilateral trade agreement decided to  delay the enforcement of tariffication for six years and to  adopt a "special exception" under which minimum access would  increase. It is said strong pressure from the United States was  behind the decision.    The U.S. Rice Millers Association (RMA) and American rice  exporters point out that "the price of American-grown rice is  relatively higher than Thai rice and that American rice may not  sell on the Japanese rice market." The prevailing view among  the RMA and American rice exporters is that it would be  advantageous for American rice exporters to secure an export  quota to Japan for six years and use this to increase their  share of the market.    The acreage of rice paddies in Arkansas and California where  medium- and small-grained rice (the Japonika variety) is grown  has expanded since Japan decided to partially open its rice  market and enthusiasm in the two states for exporting rice to  Japan is gradually growing.    The request from the U.S. Government is said to be like a  country-by-country quota under which each exporting nation is  allotted a fixed quantity which Japan will import. The Japanese  Government, however, does not like the idea.    A source at the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and  Fisheries said: "We cannot set a country-by-country rice import  quota in writing and notify each rice exporting nation of it."    The Japanese Government is believed to take such a dim view  of the U.S. request after concluding that, "if Japan proposes  adopting a country-by-country quota system in multilateral trade  negotiations, it could not avoid facing criticism from such  major rice exporting nations as Thailand and Australia."    Under the current stable food control system, the government  is obliged to manage the rice that is imported under the minimum  access arrangements.    A spokesman for the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and  Fisheries said: "We will make a comprehensive decision on which  countries Japan should import rice from after examining the use  and price of rice and the capabilities of the rice exporting  nations involved."    Some government officials, however, take the view that given  the past history of bilateral trade negotiations, Japan will  have no choice but to accept the U.S. demand.</p>

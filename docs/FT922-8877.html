			<p>920511 FT  11 MAY 92 / European Bonds: UK and French easing test accepted ERM wisdoms LAST week tested some accepted truths about the behaviour of European bond markets in the exchange rate mechanism. The UK and French governments both managed to ease monetary policy despite continued pressure for higher rates in Germany. Admitedly, the UK gilts market was rather churlish in response to Tuesday's  1/2 -point cut in UK base lending rates. Bond prices fell by a similar  1/2  point on the day at the 10-year maturity as investors took profits. The French market was kinder to it's government, which reduced the reserve requirements imposed on banks, also allowing them to cut base lending rates by  1/2 -point. Bond yields at the 10-year maturity were 8.61 per cent by the close on Friday, from 8.75 per cent at the start of the week. Both governments were able to engineer an easing of monetary conditions without sending shock waves through the bond or foreign exchange markets. Despite the initial bout of selling, gilts prices and sterling closed higher on the week. The French franc remained comfortably within its ERM limits. This seems to contradict the received wisdom that Germany now sets interest rates for the rest of Europe. There was certainly little prospect of Germany cutting interest rates last week. the Bundesbank's key measures, is running well above the target range. Consumer price inflation may have peaked, but it will only decline slowly from here on. The latest round of wage settlements are higher than the authorities would like to see. Indeed, there were sighs of relief on Thursday when the Bundesbank council opted not to raise rates. Analysts warn against reading too much into the events of last week and buying into French OATs and UK gilts on expectations of sharply lower rates and bond yields. The consensus among economists was that the French and UK last week exhausted any leeway they had to ease monetary policy and push bond prices higher. Little wonder that the French prime minister, and former long-serving finance minister, Mr Pierre Beregovoy, opted not to sanction a cut in the Bank of France money market intervention rate - the most direct method of easing monetary conditions. By reducing reserve requirements, he helped to cut the cost of credit in France's sluggish economy, yet kept money market conditions fairly tight. Last year, Mr Beregovoy was caught cutting the intervention rate before the markets thought such a move was justified. Rates were promptly put back up. He was clearly keen not to repeat the experience. This realism may also explain the muted reaction of the gilts market to last week's cut in rates. Many economists forecast just one more cut in UK interest rates before the year end. This is reflected in the UK money markets, where interbank funds are changing hands a shade above the new 10 per cent base lending rate at all maturities. On a more positive note, European bond yields do not look to be moving any higher. Investors appear unwilling to push German 10-year bund yields above 8 per cent. French 10-year yields now appear to have retreated decisively from the 8.75 per cent level tested in March and April.</p>

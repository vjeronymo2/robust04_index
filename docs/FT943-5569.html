			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / International Company News: Montedison simplifies Finagro investment Montedison, the Italian industrial conglomerate, plans to take direct control of Eridania Beghin-Say, its agro-industrial subsidiary, by absorbing Finanziaria Agroindustriale, the vehicle for the group's Eridania shares. The merger will further simplify the structure of the sprawling empire inherited by the new board of Ferruzzi Finanziaria (Ferfin), Montedison's parent, following last year's near-collapse of the group. The structure contains some 1,800 companies, many of them dormant investment vehicles. Finagro is quoted on the Milan stock exchange, but nearly 95 per cent of its shares are owned by Montedison or Ferfin. It controls just under 50 per cent of Eridania, which is quoted in France and Italy, but some 63 per cent of the voting rights. If the operation is approved at a special Montedison shareholder meeting in October, Finagro's few remaining shareholders will be offered Montedison shares in exchange for their holdings. Montedison also plans to absorb four tiny financial subsidiaries which house part of the group's Finagro stake.</p>

			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / World Trade News: German industry ridicules US stand on Airbus US CRITICISM of the European Airbus programme for unfair competition and hidden state subsidies was bluntly rejected in Germany yesterday as both hypocritical and absurd. At the same time, the German aerospace industry is calling for more state support as a 'strategic industry', and condemned its own government for inadequate planning and erratic decision-making. The twin onslaught from the German Aerospace Industry Federation came as the chief executive of Deutsche Aerospace Airbus, Mr Hartmut Mehdorn, revealed that 70 per cent of the company's 23,000 workforce would be put on short-time working in the coming months. According to Mr Wolfgang Piller, president of the German Aerospace Industry Federation, the real level of US government support for its own civil aviation industry was far greater than in Europe, and European governments should adopt similar programmes, He accused the US Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) of discriminating blatantly against European manufacturers, such as Airbus, in its registration system for new aircraft, charging foreign manufacturers for a service it provided free to the US industry. He also said the FAA introduced new safety regulations and other requirements just at the moment when new European aircraft had to be registered, forcing them to comply with rules not imposed on existing US aircraft. At the same time Mr Piller, also general manager of Deutsche Aerospace, roundly attacked his own government for its lack of a coherent aerospace programme, and for erratic and unpredictable planning of its defence spending. His sharp criticism was delivered at a review of the dismal prospects for the German aerospace industry in particular, and the world industry in general, at the publication of the German federation's annual report. He estimated that both turnover and employment in the German aerospace industry, Europe's fastest growing, had fallen by 10 per cent in 1992. Employment in the industry had dropped from 95,000 to 80,000 in the past two years. In the defence aviation sector, it was impossible to plan ahead because of the erratic nature of budget cuts, Mr Piller said. The principal target of his attack was Mr Volker Ruhe, the defence minister, who is at loggerheads with the industry over his attempts to cut back the European Fighter Aircraft programme. Mr Piller accused Mr Ruhe of behaving as if the EFA project was not an international agreement, and as if he could simply issue orders to the German industry alone. All the contracts were agreed with the other three partners, Britain, Italy and Spain.</p>

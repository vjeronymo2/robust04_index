In that way Italian  Popular Party Secretary [PPI] Mino Martinazzoli replied to  questions about how he viewed the outcome of the upcoming  elections. "I feel irritated because attempts are being made to  convince the Italians that there are only two competitors.  However, the discussions going on within both alignments  exactly serve to outline the reasons of our existence. The  Italians are not as careless as one thinks, and they are not  stupid either."    The PPI secretary also talked about the document signed by  the centrist leaders protesting against the treatment that TV  programs have reserved for their position: "I signed it with  unruffled indignation. If they showed the Italians what is  happening behind the doors, they would understand the deception  that ongoing. If someone put stockings in front of a TV camera  as a filter, it means that he is ready for a performance, and  not for a dialogue with the people."</p>

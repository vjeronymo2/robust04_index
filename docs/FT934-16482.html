			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Instant judge of value Sir, I was surprised to learn from your article on the coffee price war ('Fight over a hill o' beans', October 1) that expensive adverts for Nescafe Gold Blend cost as much or more per jar than the coffee beans. However, my colleague's reaction to this news was instant: 'That seems fair enough. The adverts are better than the coffee.' David Carter, 7 Abbey Road, Cambridge CB5 8HH</p>

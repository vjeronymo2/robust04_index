			<p>920224 FT  24 FEB 92 / UK Gilts: Prices up slightly despite weak data THE PUBLIC sector borrowing requirement figures released last week confirmed what the gilt market already suspected: the government's deficit for the full financial year is likely to top Pounds 12bn. January's figures may have shown a net repayment of Pounds 3.7bn, but they came against a background of steadily deteriorating government finances. So far, however, the market has remained relatively sanguine at the prospect of burgeoning government borrowing, and has already discounted an 'electoral' budget in which the government gives away some Pounds 3bn to 4bn in tax cuts. Because of this, the likelihood is that the PSBR will rise to at least Pounds 24bn in fiscal 1992-1993. Last week the market failed to react adversely to the steady stream of bad economic news delivering blows to the government. Prices over the week crept slightly upwards, with a consequent small decline in yields. The 10 per cent Treasury bond maturing in 2001 rose nearly  1/4 point on the week, closing on Friday night at 103 23/32 , yielding 9.37 per cent. The longer-dated 9 per cent, conversion stock (type-B) due in 2011 rose  7/32 to 98 to yield 9.14 per cent. The tolerance of the market to the weak economic data - which may reduce the Conservatives' chances for re-election - stems from long-term optimism over inflation. As Mr Nigel Richardson of SG Warburg Securities says: 'The inflation background is winning out at the long end. The PSBR is an onerous level of funding but it is offset by the background of extremely good inflation.' Headline inflation, as measured by the retail prices index, is 4.1 per cent, while core inflation, as measured by the price of manufactured goods at the factory gate, is 4.5 per cent - its lowest level for 3 1/2 years. As lower wage settlements feed through into the inflation rate, many economists believe that headline inflation will fall below 3 per cent by the end of the year. All this is encouraging for gilts at the long end. However long-term optimism is being clouded by short-term uncertainty, and there are several reasons why there is a need for caution in the market. First, there is the question mark over the election, which looks increasingly likely to take place on April 9. An opinion poll on Friday put Labour four points ahead of the Conservatives, a lead which, given the recent run of poor economic news, could become a trend. The market feels concerned about the prospects of a Labour government, arguing that it could lead to higher inflation in the long term. Secondly, overseas investors avoided the UK gilts market last week, fearful perhaps of the government's more open endorsement of fiscal reflation and the political uncertainty. Meanwhile, the question on everyone's mind during the week concerned the Pounds 1.25bn tranche of 9 per cent Treasury tap stock due in 2012, which the Bank of England issued on February 10. So far only about half of the stock has been sold. The remainder continues to cause mild indigestion, failing to attract buyers. On Friday the market was almost one point off the tap level after a second week of failing to break through. Mr Simon Briscoe, senior UK economist at Greenwell Montagu, says the haste with which the Bank issued the tap helps explain why the market is finding it difficult to make short term progress. 'One feels that the recent healthy appetite for all sterling bonds from the overseas sector could have caused the Bank to misjudge the current buying interest of the domestic institutions,' he says. If it is still there in another two weeks, the Bank will have to withdraw the stock or cut its price. After all, it has to get on with its funding requirements and cannot afford to wait around for ever.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava, April 23 (CTK) -- "We favour  negotiations on the creation of pre-election blocs. However, I  think that the forming of a political party from in the long  term and from the viewpoint of the stabilisation of the  political scene is more important than a pre-election campaign,"  Chairman of the Democratic Union of Slovakia (DEUS) Jozef  Moravcik told journalists today.    Moravcik, who is also Slovak premier, was speaking after the  assembly where DEUS was established through a merger between  Moravcik's Alternative of Political Realism (APR) and the  Alliance of Slovak Democrats (AD) of former foreign minister  Milan Knazko.    Knazko, who was elected first deputy chairman, said that  DEUS  was oriented towards Liberal International and hoped to become a  full- fledged member in a short time. DEUS' closest partners in  the Czech Republic are the Free Democrats (SD) of former  Czechoslovak Foreign Minister Jiri Dienstbier, he added.    Today's merger conference was attended by leading  representatives of Slovak political parties with the exception  of the opposition Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) and  the Slovak National Party (SNS). The conference was also  addressed by representatives of liberal parties from Hungary,  Poland and Austria.    Moravcik said that in connection with the agreement that no  political leaders would be represented in the coalition  government, the DEUS statutes say that during his time in the  government he would be represented in the leadership of DEUS by  Knazko.    Asked if DEUS would adhere to the screening law while  composing its election list of candidates, Moravcik answered  that an amendment to the law had been initiated. This would  concern people who were forced to sign collaboration agreements  with the StB secret police due to their profession, though they  did not operated in the section aimed "against domestic  enemies". As an example, Moravcik gave workers in the arms  industry. "If the screening law is valid, we will observe it,"  he added.    The screening law, adopted by the Czechoslovak Parliament in  1991, bans people linked to the former communist-run StB secret  police, high Communist Party officials and members of People's  Militia from high government and economic posts until 1996.</p>

			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / Rebels call a halt to fighting after Rwanda victory The rebel Rwanda Patriotic Front yesterday claimed victory in Rwanda's bitter civil war and declared a ceasefire after taking the last government stronghold, Gisenyi, in the north-west of the country. The rebel leader, General Paul Kagame, said his forces had advanced as far as the French protection zone in south-western Rwanda but would not go beyond positions they now occupied. The RPF, dominated by members of the minority Tutsi tribe, named a Hutu, Mr Pasteur Bizimungu, as president of what it says will be a broad-based government of national unity. His selection is an evident attempt to reassure Rwanda's Hutu majority that they have nothing to fear under the new regime. The RPF is due to install the new government in the capital, Kigali, today, as remnants of the former Rwandan government and army join the exodus of Hutus into neighbouring Zaire. Up to 1m refugees, mainly Hutus, have fled Rwanda in the past week for fear of RPF reprisals following the slaughter of hundreds of thousands of Tutsis during the chaos in Rwanda of the past three months. As a long-time member of the RPF, Mr Bizimungu is not expected to inspire confidence among supporters of the late Hutu president, Gen Juvenal Habyarimana. The new prime minister, Mr Faustin Twagiramungu, is also a Hutu. But real power will almost certainly remain in the hands of General Kagame, the military commander who formed an army of Tutsi exiles in 1990 to fight the Habyarimana dictatorship. The RPF is understood to be offering government posts to those members of the old ruling party who are not implicated in the killing of Tutsis in the wake of Gen Habyarimana's death in an air crash in April. The new government's chances of getting diplomatic recognition abroad are high, particularly since a special UN adviser on human rights has claimed that the former government was involved in directing the massacre of Tutsis. The US has given representatives of the old government five days to leave and their bank accounts have been frozen. Moves are afoot in the UN to expel the Rwandan representative on the Security Council. 'The UN will have little choice but to deal with the new government,' Ms Alison Desfoges, a consultant with Human Rights Watch Africa, the US-based human rights group, said yesterday. 'But the international community will also be in a strong position to exert leverage over the RPF, as the new government will be heavily aid-dependent.' The British charity Oxfam called yesterday for an urgent relief operation on the scale of the 1940s Berlin airlift to prevent the flight of Rwandan refugees turning into a humanitarian disaster. Oxfam said an airlift was the only way to provide the 500 tonnes of supplies needed each day. President Bill Clinton said the US was sending another Dollars 19m (Pounds 12.2m) in aid for Rwanda relief, bringing the US contribution up to Dollars 139m for the year. In Brussels, EU foreign ministers announced plans for humanitarian aid worth Ecu173m (Pounds 136m) for Rwandan refugees.</p>

			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Royal Life regular premiums down 26% Royal Life, the life assurance subsidiary of Royal Insurance, yesterday announced a 26 per cent fall in regular premium sales for 1992. The company blamed this decline to Pounds 56m on lower sales of mortgage-related products as a result of the depressed residential housing market. Total sales were up by 34 per cent from Pounds 293m to Pounds 392m, but the increase was accounted for by the company's newly-launched single premium with-profits bond, which raised Pounds 144m. Total single premiums, including the with-profits bond, rose by 55 per cent to Pounds 336m. Mr David Parry, managing director of Royal Life, said he was 'very encouraged' by the 1992 new premium figures, and added that a 'major restructuring' within the company had been completed. The share price remained unchanged on the day at 285p.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with National Defense Minister Mehmet Golhan by </F> Nedret Ersanel on 8 April; place not given]    [Text] [Ersanel] Enrollment in the Army is an issue  concerning your ministry that is being widely debated in public,  particularly the situation of Open University students. Have  you started to enroll these students in the Army? They claim  that they are being treated unfairly compared with other  university students.    [Golhan] We are given the freedom to act within the law.  Nowhere does it say that the military service of these students  must be deferred. Those students who are not registered in  universities where attendance is mandatory do not have the right  to have their military service deferred. During the first years  of the Open University, however, the National Defense Ministry  granted it the same rights as other universities as a privilege,  because there was no need for more soldiers. It was the right  thing to do. In time, however, our sources shrank. There was a  shortage in the number of soldiers. The number of absentee  conscripts reached almost 250,000. When the public heard of this  situation, some 30,000 youths enrolled in the Army. As of  February this year, the deficit figure is below 210,000. Now,  we do not want to call up our youths in the Open University  while the conscription absentees are showing up to enroll.  However, I want to tell you about a survey we conducted. Some  82,000 Open University students had to repeat classes twice. We  cannot have that. We did not call them up this term, but we may  do so in August or November by calling up those who had to  repeat classes more than others. The Open University is not  perturbed by students having to repeat classes, because that is  its source of revenue. At this stage, we have not called up  these students, except for those who came voluntarily.    [Ersanel] Do you find this way of calling up students  democratic? Will you call all of them up eventually?    [Golhan] We are a constitutional state, a state of law. I  cannot do otherwise. I hope that we will not have to lean on  the students too much and that the shortage will be covered by  the absentees' showing up. We need 30,000-40,000 enrollments  every conscription period. We cannot take any more anyway.  Even if all the 82,000 come, we cannot take them. We do not  have the place to put them. The number of conscripts we need  now are coming to us. In fact, even if all the absentee  conscripts show up, we cannot take them.    [Ersanel] Are you considering new measures such as extending  the length of military service, payment instead of military  service, or extending the scope of discharge?    [Golhan] These issues will continue to remain on the agenda  for some time. At this stage, however, we are not considering  extending the length of military service. I do not know what  the conditions will be in the future. We are not considering  payment instead of military service at this stage, but we might  in the future. It is a matter of time. Let me say one thing:  We will eliminate the noncommissioned officers in time.    [Ersanel] Is there a change in Turkey's defense concept?    [Golhan] Our neighbors are involved in an arms race. They  are also trying to get hold of, find, and acquire nuclear  weapons. Therefore, we must keep the Turkish Armed Forces at a  certain level of power. We hear criticism to our right and to  our left. We maintain the same priorities in our defense  concept. Our neighbors to the south -- let me not say who they  are -- are in the race for nuclear arms. At the moment, they do  not have nuclear arms, but they have long-range missiles that  can hit Ankara. We must take our measures.    [Ersanel] How?    [Golhan] We must not lag behind them; that is all I can say.  If those who covet our land know that we lack the necessary  weaponry, they may become aggressive. Let me say this: Turkey  is the most powerful military force in the region, except for  the missile issue. Unlike other countries, we do not violate UN  resolutions.    [Ersanel] Germany displayed a harsh stand in connection with  the weapons it gives to Turkey being used in the southeast. How  do you view this?    [Golhan] The problem is this: We bought some weapons from  Russia. They are very similar to the German weapons. Foreign  press members who were in the southeast confused the two. They  said that the weapons were German-made and made a big noise  about it. We received a letter from the German defense minister  today in which he thanks us. We are going to buy weapons from  Germany on the basis of our defense industry cooperation. He  says he will be of assistance. Foreign Minister Kinkel's message  is along the same lines.    There are many PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] members in  Germany. They are friendly with the press, and they have money.  It is they who spread the rumor that Turkey is using these  weapons. Of course, we must not forget that there will be  elections in Germany soon.    First, they alleged that we were using the weapons against  the Kurdish people in the region. Then they said we should not  use them against the PKK. What else do they want? Are there  only German weapons in the world? I can use my U.S.-made or  Russian-made weapons.    [Ersanel] The United States has been talking recently,  especially in meetings held in Turkey, about a "political  solution" to the Kurdish problem. You participated in those  meetings. You held your most recent contact with the Americans  in connection with this issue last Thursday. What is this  "political solution" mentioned by the United States and, in a  way, by the West?    [Golhan] Look, until two years ago, we heard the HEP  [People's Labor Party] and then the DEP [Democracy Party]  deputies talk about a "political and democratic solution." What  is this solution? They said there cannot be a solution with  military force. All right, what is the solution? They do not  say.    Behind this solution implied by our friends and certain  circles is a separate and independent Kurdish state. The idea  of a federation lies behind this political solution. That is  the meaning. The Kurds have free elections, free trade, the  right to settle and work anywhere in the country. What other  rights do they want? These are the rights I have, too. Do  people who speak Kurdish have a problem?    [Ersanel] Earlier, Assistant U.S. Secretary of State Oxman  also talked about a political solution. So, is what the U.S.  officials mean no different from what you are saying?    [Golhan] Yes, what they say is no different from what I am  saying. Charles Freeman, assistant U.S. secretary of defense,  came to me on Thursday and said: "The PKK is certainly a  terrorist organization." He said: "Europe will also realize  this one day."    [Ersanel] Did he say what he means by a political solution?    [Golhan] No. The aim of the political solution is a  federation. Let me tell you that frankly.</p>

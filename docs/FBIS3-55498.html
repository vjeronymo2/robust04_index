			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Nikolay Morozov] </F>   [Text] Bucharest January 10 TASS -- Russia was not  conquered as a result of the disappearance of a bipolar  geo-political system. As before it remains a powerful state, a  great power which is only passing through a difficult stage,  apparently, just as other East European countries, Romania's  Defence Minister Lieutenant-General Niculae Spiroiu emphasised  in an interview with ITAR-TASS. According to him, it concerns  the selection of a new social, political and economic system by  the people of Russia, and it does not at all mean that Russia  has lost some kind of battle.    As far as ensuring security is concerned, after the  disintegration of the Warsaw Treaty Organization its member  states were left in a vacuum. That why it was natural for them  to strive to improve their state of affairs. A kind of  competition started to join NATO, the minister said. I presume  that at the NATO summit in Brussels a decision will be adopted  within the American initiative network of "partnership in the  name of peace" and provide these states certain support in the  sphere of security, Spiroiu noted. This initiative will be a  step ahead, according to him.    Russia's apprehensions in connection with the widening of  NATO are very well understood by us, the head of the Romanian  defence department indicated. That is the reason why we  consider that Russia should participate in programmes of  cooperation with NATO. If Russia is not included in the new  structures of security, then they will not get the needed trust  in them and will not become sufficiently effective. The Russian  Federation cannot be excluded from this process. There is a  need to create a system of equal security for all in which  Russia will acquire its place and role corresponding to its  importance. Any kind of discrimination would only lead to  suspicion, tension and potential hot spots of instability, the  Romanian defence minister said.</p>

			<p><P> August 30, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MARIJUANA PLANTATION FOUND NORTH OF MALIBU  </P> <P> A total of 1,621 mature marijuana plants up to 16 feet tall were chopped down  and removed Wednesday from a secluded, heavily camouflaged field at the foot of  a steep hill in the Santa Monica Mountains, sheriff's deputies said.  </P> <P> The discovery of the plants was made Tuesday afternoon on a steep slope about  300 yards below Saddle Peak Road near Stunt Road after deputies fielded an  anonymous call tipping them off to the illicit plantation, Sgt. Bob Stoneman  said.  </P> <P> Deputies got the call Monday, but aerial and foot searches of the area in the  canyons about 5 miles north of Malibu Beach at first missed the plants, which  were covered by camouflage cloth, Stoneman said.  </P> <P> "It appears to be a sophisticated operation that has been going on for some  time," Stoneman said.  </P> <P> Crews chopped down the plants, and a sheriff's helicopter airlifted bundles out  of the mountains to a fire station in the Malibu hills, Stoneman said.  </P> <P> No suspects were in custody.  </P></p>

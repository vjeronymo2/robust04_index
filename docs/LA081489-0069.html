			<p><P> August 14, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WPPSS PLANS NEW $450-MILLION BOND OFFERING;  </P> <P> UTILITY WILL REPLACE HIGH-INTEREST INSTRUMENTS BEFORE DEFAULTED ISSUES SETTLED  </P> <P> Whoops. It's back.  </P> <P> WPPSS -- the Washington Public Power Supply System, biggest municipal bond  defaulter in history -- plans to return to the bond market for the first time  since it failed to make good on $2.25 billion in bonds in 1983.  </P> <P> Next week it expects to sell $450 million in bonds that will replace  high-interest bonds used to fund construction of two incomplete nuclear power  plants.  </P> <P> Some investors burned by the bad WPPSS bonds are a bit miffed that WPPSS, which  gained the pronunciation "whoops" after its infamous default -- is refinancing  bonds before it settles all claims over the defaulted issues.  </P> <P> "I just think it's a foolish move," said C. Richard Lehmann, who founded the  Bond Investors Assn. in Miami to provide advice to holders of WPPSS bonds and  other defaulted issues.  </P> <P> "The whole purpose of the refinancing is to save interest. It seems to me that  it would behoove them to clear the air" on the old bonds first, he said. "I  think it's going to have a financial effect on the interest rates they're going  to have to pay" on the new bonds, he added.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Big Savings Estimated  </P> <P> WPPSS officials say, however, that it would be foolish to continue paying  double-digit interest rates on the existing bonds for WPPSS nuclear units 1 and  3. They say they hope to float the new bonds in the 7% range.  </P> <P> WPPSS, a consortium of utilities formed to build five nuclear plants, estimates  that it will save an average of $70 million to $80 million a year over the next  30 years through the refinancing.  </P> <P> Bond experts predict that WPPSS will have to pay a penalty in the form of  higher interest on the bonds because of the default. They say the bonds may  yield about a quarter basis point more than similarly rated bonds, according to  the Bond Buyer, which called the bond sale the deal of the year. A basis point  is one-hundredth of a percentage point.  </P> <P> Last week, Moody's Investors Service gave a rating of "A" to the new bonds,  which it considers an upper medium-grade rating on a scale that runs from Aaa  to D.  </P> <P> Moody's said its rating is based on the fact that the bonds are backed by the  Bonneville Power Administration, a federal agency that sells power in the  Northwest. The BPA will finance the bonds through revenue that it receives from  selling power generated by hydroelectric plants in the Northwest.  </P> <P> In addition, a change in the federal bankruptcy code last year clarified that  WPPSS' units 1 and 3 are insulated from any legal claims against units 4 and 5,  the ones that defaulted, in the event of a WPPSS bankruptcy filing.  </P> <P> Standard &amp; Poor's Corp., the other major credit rating concern, last year  reinstated its AA-minus rating on units 1 and 3 as well as unit 2, which is  operating. The rating is a degree higher than Moody's.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 250-Page Statement  </P> <P> Heather L. Ruth, president of the Public Securities Assn., the main trade group  for the municipal bond industry, said the fact that WPPSS is returning to the  bond market indicates that its advisers feel enough time has passed since the  default for the supply system's bad reputation to have faded.  </P> <P> "If they weren't WPPSS they would have refunded much sooner," she said.  </P> <P> Despite WPPSS' history, expectations are that the bond issue will have no  trouble finding buyers.  </P> <P> "I suspect it's going to be a good deal," Ruth said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 16, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: MISSION VIEJO;  </P> <P> 20,000 EXPECTED AT ST. PATRICK'S PARADE  </P> <P> A St. Patrick's Day parade that started because of a $10 bet celebrates its  21st anniversary Saturday, and organizers are predicting that 20,000 people  will attend the event.  </P> <P> The Mission Viejo St. Patrick's Day Parade began in 1970 when one community  resident bet another that no more than 200 people would join an Irish march  down one of the community's main thoroughfares.  </P> <P> More than 2,000 people showed up that day, however, and the parade has become a  staple of South Orange County's St. Patrick's Day festivities.  </P> <P> "Practically every kid in South Orange County has been in that parade at some  point or another," said John Ben, a longtime Mission Viejo resident and one of  the parade's organizers. "It's become quite a tradition."  </P> <P> This year's parade will take off at noon Saturday from the corner of Alicia  Parkway and Olympiad Road and proceed toward Lake Mission Viejo, where it will  wind up near the shore. More than 6,000 marchers are expected. The Disney  cartoon character Roger Rabbit will be this year's grand marshal.  </P> <P> Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, Shriners, equestrian groups, high school bands, floats  and local dignitaries are among the 148 entries in the parade. Prizes will be  awarded for the best band and for other categories. The group deemed most  humorous will receive the parade's prized Leprechaun.  </P> <P> "Everybody's Irish for the day," Ben said. "We've got a real good Irish flavor  here in Mission Viejo."  </P></p>

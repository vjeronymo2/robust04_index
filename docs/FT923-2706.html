			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / Money Markets: Rates rise sharply THE BULLISHNESS that dominated Monday's trading in both the sterling cash and futures markets was reversed yesterday as sterling slumped to a new post-ERM entry low of DM2.7800 against the D-Mark. The pound's fall pushed rates in the sterling cash market up to levels which could be incompatible with 10 per cent base rates for long. There were rumours last night that clearing banks were in discussion with the Bank of England. The one-month sterling cash rate finished at 10 1/2 per cent on the offered side, up from a previous close of 10 3/16 per cent. Clearing banks are currently lending money at 10 per cent, but if the rate at which they borrow from each other stays at the 10 1/2 per cent level for long they will ask the Bank to signal a rate rise. Three-month money, an important indicator of where the market thinks rates are moving, ended at 10 3/4 per cent on the offered side,  1/2 percentage point up from the previous close of 10 1/4 per cent on Monday night. One clearing bank dealer said that the UK government could probably withstand a rise in UK base rates this week, but that all would depend on the outcome of the French referendum on Sunday. However, in the longer term, he felt that the UK's economic problems would leave sterling weak. The December short sterling contract dropped 65 basis points from its previous close, bottoming out at 89.09. This was still above the record low of 89.00 that it reached on August 25, but discounted a full percentage point increase in base rates. Because the tension in the markets came in the afternoon, traders were relaxed about removing the Pounds 950m shortage forecast in the morning. The Bank of England bought Pounds 5m of Band 1 Treasury bills at 9 7/8 per cent, Pounds 5m of Band 3 bank bills at 9 3/4 per cent, Pounds 43m of Band 4 bank bills at 9 per cent and Pounds 20m in a repurchase agreement at 9 15/16 per cent. The forecast was revised to Pounds 900m and the Bank purchased Pounds 9m of Band 1 bank bills, Pounds 28m of Band 3 bank bills and Pounds 19m of Band 4 bank bills. In the afternoon, the Bank bought Pounds 200m of Band 1 bank bills, Pounds 1m of Band 3 Treasury bills, Pounds 13m of Band 3 bank bills, Pounds 1m of Band 4 Treasury bills, Pounds 27m of Band 4 bank bills, and Pounds 600m in a repo.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Salvador Rico] </F>   [Text] Some PRI [Institutional Revolutionary Party]  members might join those who have already abandoned the tricolor  party.    Others, "fed up with handpicked candidates [dedazos] and  decisions adopted by party leaders [palomazos]," are organizing  new movements to demand internal democracy.    These are two sides of the tricolor party's current reality.    After the defection of four important PRI members --  Demetrio  Sodi de la Tijera and Miguel Basanez in the Federal District;  Rodrigo Moreno Rodriguez in Guanajuato; and Guillermo del Rio  Ortegon in Campeche -- forecasts hold that other PRI members  will leave their party given their disagreement with the way in  which Senate candidacies were recently decided.    Regarding the increase in internal demands for  democratization, PRI representatives for 12 of the capital's 40  districts yesterday announced the creation of a Citizens Liaison  and Consultation Board [Coordinacion de Enlace y Consulta  Ciudadana], which essentially strives for truly democratic  selection of tricolor party candidates to the Chamber of  Deputies.    The new group's coordinators -- Oscar Hidalgo, Jose Manuel  Mota Lopez, Jose Luis Guerra, and Ricardo Palacios -- said "PRI  members are fed up with handpicked candidates and decisions  adopted by party leaders."    They warned that if there is no democratic selection of  candidates for the posts of deputies and assembly members in the  Federal District, the consequences will be not only the  resignation of many activists but also a considerable decrease  in votes for the PRI on 21 August.    They said both PRI activists and sympathizers participate in  the new organization.    Jose Luis Guerra reproved the fact that candidacies are  decided by the leadership, without taking into consideration the  rank and file.    He protested: "Those of us who work with the rank and file  are not taken into consideration. We are the ones insulted  every time we knock on doors."    Leaders of the Citizens Liaison and Consultation Board,  which  has ties with Democracy 2000, announced they will submit a  proposal to the PRI's leadership in the Federal District, whose  president is Manuel Jimenez Guzman. The proposal is to cast  votes to elect the candidates for the lower chamber. This would  not only include the participation of party activists but also  of sympathizers, because they are the ones who usually determine  the victories.    They warned that the disagreement recently expressed by  former Chihuahua Governor Fernando Baeza Melendez might multiply  among people running for the post of Federal District deputy.    Democracy is an urgent necessity, Jose Manuel Mota Lopez  insisted, adding that if the PRI leadership and Ernesto Zedillo  truly want to honor Luis Donaldo Colosio Murrieta's memory, they  should recall what the assassinated politician said in his 6  March speech -- that PRI members do not want candidates whose  active membership surprises even the tricolor party's members.    Mota Lopez said: Zedillo must fulfill his pledge to continue  Colosio's political program.    He noted there are many members of the PRI who are deputies  or assembly members without having earned that right, who now  want to swap posts between the lower chamber and the assembly.    Many of those PRI members "have never taken a stand," Mota  Lopez added during a news conference yesterday.    He explained that in addition to the risk of more defections  and a considerable decrease in PRI votes on 21 August, this  could result in protests at the chamber and assembly facilities  in the capital.    The text of the document that formally creates the Citizens  Liaison and Consultation Board begins by stating that "a  transition process in Mexico's democratic culture is under way."    The document continues: "The armed rebellion in Chiapas,  Luis  Donaldo Colosio's death, the national stock market's ups and  downs, and the increasing insecurity which prevails since  Cardinal Posadas Ocampo's violent and still unsolved  assassination have prompted civilian society to increase its  demands for a change in the political system, above all in the  way in which the next electoral process will be handled."    "Nevertheless, high-ranking groups insist on keeping the  country in a state of political indecision and uncertainty,  without allowing opportunity for democratic transition, which is  now so urgent and necessary."    It then reasserts its immediate goal:    "The PRI should respect the statutes, declaration of  principles, and partisan action program, and it should let the  rank and file and the citizenry participate in the process of  selecting candidates for different public posts."    Jose Manuel Mota Lopez reiterated his warning about the risk  of more resignations among PRI members, commenting:    "I do not know why they are afraid of democracy."</p>

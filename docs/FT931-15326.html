			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / Cricket tour to continue despite Bombay violence THE PRESIDENT of the Indian Cricket Board insisted yesterday that the tour by the England team would not be called off despite violence in Bombay and other parts of western India. The first one-day international, due to have been played in Ahmedabad on Saturday, has been cancelled but Indian officials argue that it was just bad luck that the six-match series was scheduled to start there. They believe that the area will be quiet by February 19 when the last of the three Test matches is due to start in Bombay. The growth of international broadcasting and the accompanying sponsorship and advertising revenues has made cricket tours of India lucrative. British Sky Broadcasting, the UK satellite television company, is to broadcast all the international matches. One Indian cricket journalist estimated that revenue would pass Dollars 1m (Pounds 650,000) - from television rights, team and match sponsorship - before a ticket was sold.</p>

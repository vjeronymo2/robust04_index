			<p><P> December 7, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GIRLS' PREP BASKETBALL;  </P> <P> NO. 1 BREA-OLINDA STARTS SLOWLY, THEN ROARS PAST NO. 2 EL TORO  </P> <P> For a little more than one quarter, Brea-Olinda High School looked vulnerable  in the championship game of the Irvine Girls' Basketball Tournament at  Woodbridge High School.  </P> <P> Second-ranked El Toro led the county's top-ranked team by four points a minute  into the second half. Then reality set in. El Toro went cold from the perimeter  and Brea scored 13 consecutive points to take a 30-21 lead two minutes before  the half. El Toro never recovered and wound up losing, 75-55.  </P> <P> Most of the Wildcats' points in the decisive run came on the inside from  Jinelle Williams, a 5-foot-8 center. Williams led all scorers with 24 points  and was the tournament's most valuable player. Brea-Olinda is unbeaten in four  games.  </P> <P> The early season matchup of the county's top two teams left unanswered one  question: Can a county team beat Brea-Olinda?  </P> <P> El Toro (3-1) gave a good account of itself, staying closer than Brea's  previous three tournament opponents, who lost by margins of 28, 32 and 28.

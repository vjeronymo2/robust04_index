			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Fedor Yemchenko: "Nuclear-Powered Ship Ural Is </F> Sinking in Dock"]    [Text] Another group of specialists is coming to Moscow to  "extract" money from the state budget. This time the attack has  been made by representatives of the shipbuilding sector, to be  precise the "Baltiyskiy Zavod" from St. Petersburg.    The day before the plant trade union committee sent a  telegram to Premier V. Chernomyrdin which said: "Your  instructions to extinguish debts for work carried out on the  construction of the nuclear-powered icebreaker Ural over 1993  and the first quarter of this year are being ignored by the  ministries of finances and transport. The government's inaction  is making it impossible to continue the building of two  nuclear-powered ships -- the icebreaker Ural and the cruiser  Petr Velikiy. If your promises and directives are not binding  for ministers, then it is time you retired."    "The situation at the plant is critical," says trade union  committee chairman Vyacheslav Firyulin. "The halting of the  building of these ships will not only affect our collective.  The state will also incur enormous losses."    Of course, the "Baltiyskiy Zavod" collective's  recommendation  is not compulsory for the head of government. But it is  scarcely sensible to dismiss SOS signals.</p>

			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / Carsberg backs advocacy claim SIR Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, yesterday signalled his approval of the Law Society's latest application for wider advocacy rights for solicitors in the higher courts. Sir Bryan said the application - which was rejected by the Lord Chancellor's Advisory Committee last week - did not have, nor was likely to have, the effect of restricting, distorting or preventing competition to any significant extent. Sir Bryan said that extending higher court advocacy rights to solicitors would widen consumer choice and might lead to gains in efficiency.</p>

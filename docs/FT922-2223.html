			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Placing at 130p values Country Casuals at Pounds 22m SHARES in Country Casuals, the women's clothing retailer and designer, were yesterday placed with a variety of institutions at a price of 130p, valuing the company at Pounds 22.2m, writes Richard Gourlay. The shares will begin trading on June 25, but there is no public offering for sale. The price represented 15.9 times pro-forma earnings for the year to January. Some 8.3m of the 17.1m shares in issue were placed. The management team, led by Mr John Shannon, chairman, will be left with 32.5 per cent of the enlarged capital, while Invesco MIM, will retain a 14.4 per cent stake. Mr Shannon said he saw the flotation of Country Casuals as 'a beginning' not the end of the process begun in 1989 when Coats Viyella sold the company to his management buy-in team. He expected growth to come from continued expansion of the Country Casuals brand through more retail outlets and through the introduction of its Diffusion Sport casual wear. The company was in no hurry to expand through acquisition, but it intended to apply the same management techniques that revived Country Casuals to another brand which it would buy in the medium term. Country Casuals designs and sells tailored and knitted separates for the Pounds 7bn a year outerwear ladies market. Last year pre-tax profits were Pounds 2m on sales of Pounds 36m. Having started with debt of Pounds 10.5m, the company had positive net cash at the last year-end. Since the buy-in, trading margins have increased from 4.4 per ent to 6.1 per cent. The company will be receiving Pounds 4.6m after expenses from the shares sale.</p>

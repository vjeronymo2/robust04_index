			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / Drink: Simply the apple of their eye - Giles MacDonogh visits the Pays d'Auge to sample Calvados, the Norman apple brandy IT MAY have taken a while for the idea to sink in, but I think that even the slowest among us has realised that wine is made from hundreds of different grapes and that the grape type has a determining effect on flavour. The same applies to apples and cider, and indeed, calvados or Norman apple brandy. Ask a calvados producer what apples he uses and you will begin to wish you had not. There are as many as 600 different kinds, and a great many more must have become extinct over the past century. A traditionalist such as Claude Camut, in La Lande-Saint Leger in Calvados' best region, the Pays d'Auge, has about 25 different sorts of apple growing on his 35 hectares (85 acres). The rather more modernist Domaine L. Dupont in Victot-Pontfol still has 10 different sorts scattered over 27 hectares (65 acres). The favourites vary from property to property: Camut has at least a third of his land planted with Bisquet, but he is increasingly impressed by the Dutch Belle de Boskop. A single variety, however, would simply not do: real calvados is a blend of early ripening, mid-season ripening and late-ripening sorts; the clues to many of these lie in their names. For example a Saint Martin apple ripens in November; a Noel des Champs in December. The two schools of thought in Calvados are less divided about the multiplicity of apples going into the vats than they are about three other burning issues: the use of dwarf trees in rows to increase yields; the age of the cider to be distilled; and the use of new oak casks to give supplementary flavours to spirits marketed young. For Claude Camut the quality of the apples from the old, high-branched trees is marginally better. He agrees, however, that the yields are dramatically lower: about one third as much. The new trees also take only five years to reach maturity as against 15 for a traditionally grown tree. With incentives like these few growers now plant the old-style orchards which were considerably more attractive than the new uniform rows. In old orchards the Normandy cows also played their part: 'My cows prune the trees,' says Camut. Camut is also at the extreme right of the dispute over what age of cider to distill. He waits two years until the cider has 'settled.' Others, such as Christian Drouin, a former marketing teacher turned distiller in Coudray-Rabut, insist that the habit of distilling old cider was borne simply of the necessity of getting rid of last year's left-overs before you fermented the new season's apples. You handed over the old, flat cider to a peripatetic distiller and made some nice fresh stuff. Etienne Dupont agrees with him: old cider makes for fiery calvados. Perhaps Camut does not worry about this because he has such large stocks already mellowed by time. Numerous pre-war vintages lie in cask in his cellars and, in his opinion, his range does not really start in earnest until you reach the 40 year old. Etienne Dupont is a former banker who has clearly weighed up the whole question with a shrewd financier's mind. Both he and Christian Drouin want to make calvados which will be ready younger. Both use some new oak casks to give the spirit a kick start. Drouin ages some of his calvados in secondhand port and amontillado sherry casks. This naturally adds to the colour of the spirit and gives a fruity roundness to the calvados. All three estates make high quality hand-made spirits which are a considerable step up from the industrial production of big companies such as Pere Magliore and Boulard. Camut's calvados begins to taste increasingly of licorice as it gets older; it loses the baked-apple flavour of the younger spirits and becomes increasingly abstract. Drouin's vintages, such as 1967, 1968 and 1969, are far softer, occasionally giving off a whiff of honey and bananas. Of the new school producers I slightly preferred Dupont, whose ten-year-old has a smoky character (probably from the wood) and whose older spirits have a little note of fresh crushed almonds. A fourth producer I visited was the Swiss Herr Affentranger at the Chateau du Breuil at Le Breuil-en-Auge. The calvados from Chateau du Breuil used to be one of the best known in France when it was the property of the Bizouard family; recognisable on every drinks trolley by the distinctive, clapper-shape of its bottles. Du Breuil's calvados is perhaps the least appley of the lot, with a very dry style. The Royal even has a slight rustic note, so that one has no trouble conjuring up an image of a Normandy cow munching windfalls in the orchard.

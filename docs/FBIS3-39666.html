			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Spanish Defense Minister Julian Garcia Vargas  admitted today that he is considering the possibility of  redeploying to Sarajevo the 130 Spanish blue helmets who are in  the Bosnian city of Jablanica in response to the request for  reinforcements made by the head of UN forces in Bosnia.    The minister, who spoke to the press after the swearing-in  of  the new Army chief of staff, said that for the present, until  more precise details of the request are known, the Spanish blue  helmets will remain in the area assigned to them at present --  Herzegovina, which is quite a long way from Sarajevo.    After admitting the possibility of redeploying the Spanish  soldiers from Jablanica to Sarajevo, he explained that his first  concern is the future of the area where the Spanish blue helmets  are at present, above all the city of Mostar, which is their  responsibility.</p>

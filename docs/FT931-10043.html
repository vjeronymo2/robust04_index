			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / People: John West resigns John West has resigned as non-executive chairman of Dalgety, the food group, and of Bridon, maker of wire rope and engineered products, having just suffered a stroke. Dalgety has appointed Maurice Warren, chief executive, to succeed West, 65, who became chairman of Dalgety only last September. Richard Clothier, who had been due to become chief executive when Warren turns 60 in June, will now do so on April 1. Warren has agreed to remain chairman for the indefinite future and says the appointment will not affect his plans to become non-executive chairman of the South West Electricity Board in June. Bridon yesterday named Derek Edwards, a non-executive director of the company for the past eight years, as chairman, and Brian Clayton as chief executive. Clayton has been responsible for day-to-day executive decisions since David Allday resigned as chief executive in September. ***** John Hogan has been appointed chief operating officer of Lasmo, the independent oil exploration and production company. He replaces Joe Darby who recently became chief executive after Chris Greentree decided to step down. John Hogan has been managing director of Lasmo's North Sea operations for the past four years. At 39, he is generally regarded as one of the industry's younger generation of pragmatic managers who have to weigh more keenly the financial risks and rewards of oil exploration in a climate of persistently low oil prices. He is a qualified geologist and has worked in the industry since leaving university. With previous positions at Shell UK, Britoil and Elf, he joined Lasmo in 1981. As chief operating officer, he will have responsibility for the day-to-day management of Lasmo's worldwide operations. Hogan is succeeded as managing director of Lasmo North Sea by Russell Harvey, currently production and operations director. ***** National Home Loans, the centralised mortgage lender, has reinforced its senior management to cope with the task of administering its Pounds 2.62bn of mortgage assets and restoring its fortunes by repaying its Pounds 700m on-balance sheet debt. NHL, which came close to collapse last year because of losses on lending, has appointed two executives who left Nationwide Building Society last year. Christopher French, who was at Nationwide for 22 years, has been appointed chief operating officer of NHL. He will take over the running of NHL's operations in Solihull from Jonathan Perry, the company's executive chairman. Brian Murkin, a chartered accountant who joined Nationwide in 1979, and was divisional director of management services there before leaving last year, has become the divisional director for finance, also based in Solihull. He will back up Nigel Terrington, the finance director who now splits his time between Solihull and the treasury operations in London. NHL says the change of management does not necessarily augur a change in plans for the future of the group after it has managed to restructure and repay debt and work out bad loans in its National Mortgage Bank subsidiary. National Home Loans lost Pounds 146.4m last year after making provisions of Pounds 138.5m to cover possible bad debts.</p>

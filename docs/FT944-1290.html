			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / People: BBC tempts Channel 4 executive Caroline Thomson, Channel 4's head of corporate affairs, is to take on a powerful new job at BBC World Service. The roles of the former deputy managing director David Witherow - who retired in September - and that of Anthony Rendell, controller of strategy and corporate affairs who retires next Easter, are being combined. Thomson becomes the World Service's strategy and corporate affairs director, and will deputise for Sam Younger, recently appointed managing director of the World Service. Thomson, who began her career as a BBC trainee in 1975 after studying history and economics at York University, joins the World Service at a time when it is committed to launching new services, while its government grant is declining in real terms. She worked on a range of BBC radio and television programmes, including Analysis and Panorama, before joining Channel 4 in 1984 as commissioning editor for finance and industry. She said although it had been exciting working for Channel 4 'after 11 years it is time for a new challenge'. She is the daughter of Lord Thomson of Monifieth, former chairman of the Independent Broadcasting Authority.</p>

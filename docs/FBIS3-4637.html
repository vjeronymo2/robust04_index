			<p>Language: <F P=105> Cambodian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Khieu Samphan, head of the Party of </F> Democratic Kampuchea by unidentified station correspondent;  dated 25 February -- recorded]    [Text] [Correspondent] My respects to your excellency Mr.  Chairman. We, representatives of the Voice of the Great  National Union Front of Cambodia [VGNUFC], are very happy that  you have granted us this interview. As you know, the Anlung  Veng Front's Command and the Democratic Kampuchean National Army  [NADK]'s High Command have already informed our compatriots that  on 24 February 1994, our NADK completely smashed the fourth  large-scale military operation of the Vietnamese communist  puppets and the two-headed government on Anlung Veng  battlefield. Our entire compatriots are very pleased with this  news. We would like your excellency to tell us about the future  developments of the situation.    [Khieu Samphan] I would like to thank you, VGNUFC  correspondents. Actually, this large-scale military operation  to destroy Anlung Veng has been the military campaign of the  Hanoi Vietnamese communists, the Vietnamese communist puppets,  the two-headed government, and the evil alliance to destroy and  compel Democratic Kampuchea [DK] to accept their three points  and thereby to destroy the five-point uideline of His Majesty  the King, to oppose the king himself, to destroy the hope for  national reconciliation, and to eliminate our Cambodian nation  and people. They have already launched four large-scale military  operations. The crushing of those four large-scale military  operations, particularly the fourth on 24 February, is a very  big defeat suffered by the Vietnamese communists, the Vietnamese  communist puppets, the two-headed government, and the alliance.  It is a victory of our entire people and of the forces  supporting the king's five-point national reconciliation plan,  and of peace-loving countries in the world.    What will the future situation be? Will the Hanoi Vietnamese  communists, the elements that they have installed, the  two-headed government, and their alliance stubbornly carry on  the Vietnamese war of aggression, continue to oppose the king  and his five-point guideline for national reconciliation, and do  their utmost to eliminate the Cambodian nation and people?    I am firmly convinced that if they continue to do so, they  will certainly suffer even more serious defeats. This is  because, it is very clear that the two-headed government's  forces have suffered heavy casualties in the defeat at Anlung  Veng. Presently, the two- headed government's troops routed at  Anlung Veng, [words indistinct]. We do not know how many of  them [words indistinct] in the jungle and died because of the  lack of food and water, particularly at this time of the year  when water sources become scarce. Most importantly, those who  continue the Hanoi Vietnamese communists' war of aggression and  who oppose national reconciliation will certainly be opposed and  condemned even more strongly by the Cambodian nation and people.    At a time when the Vietnamese communists have amassed tens  of  thousands of square kilometers of Cambodia's territory from the  Dragon's tail [area in Mondolkiri Province] down to Kampot  Province, as well as her seas and continental shelf, at a time  when they continue to send more Vietnamese settlers into  Cambodia with numbers already reaching four million [words  indistinct] a second Kampuchea Kraom [former Cambodian territory  now in Vietnam], at a time when our people have to undergo  hardship and suffering [passage indistinct], the two-headed  government has done nothing to resolve these grave problems. It  has instead tried hard to continue fueling the Vietnamese war of  aggression to eliminate our nation and people (?and) DK  resistance forces.    Can the Cambodian nation and people accept such a situation?  Make no mistake about it. Our nation and people are not  ignorant. They are fully aware of who is responsible for their  current misery and suffering. No one can deceive them as they  have seen with their own eyes and are the victims of such a  hardship and suffering.    1. They can see clearly that the continued misery and  suffering of our nation and people come from the fact that the  aggressor Hanoi Vietnamese communists have continued their  aggression and occupation of our country through the state power  that they have installed since 1979. The aggressor Hanoi  Vietnamese communists are behind this state power and have  continued to control and guide this state power, carrying on  their war of aggression through this state power, sending more  Vietnamese nationals to Cambodia in line with their strategy to  annex Cambodia through a demographic war, and so forth.    2. They also know that it is because some foreign powers  together with the Vietnamese communists have attempted to  eliminate the Cambodian people and oppose the national  reconciliation and the king.    3. They know that it is because this two-headed government  which is only the by-product of the aggressor Hanoi Vietnamese  communists and their evil alliance and (?stays in the iron cage)  of the Vietnamese communist puppets.    These are indeed the causes of the misery and suffering of  our nation and people who can no longer tolerate them.    Look at the countryside, what is the situation there? The  most outstanding development is that our people have risen up  and mutinied against the Vietnamese puppets' village and commune  administration to liberate their villages and communes. They  have mutinied not just to seize back their farmlands, cattle,  rice, and food, but also to oppose the war to eliminate the  Cambodian nation and people.    In Phnom Penh and other provincial towns, students and  teachers have staged demonstrations. The people whose land and  houses were appropriated have also staged demonstrations. Those  puppet troops and Para [Khmer People's National Liberation  Frong] and FUNCINPEC [National United Front for an Independent,  Neutral, Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia] soldiers have also  mutinied against the war to eliminate their own nation and  people. They have turned their guns against the evil  ringleaders and deserted their ranks, even hundreds at a time.  Some who can no longer make a living have turned to rob traders  and customers in markets. Some homeless soldiers have tried to  settle anywhere they can. There have also been bloody  repressions and so forth.    What does all these mean? Is this not a signal that our  nation and people are no longer able to endure?    What are the causes of the defeat suffered at Anlung Veng by  the Vietnamese communist puppets, the two-headed government, the  Vietnamese communists, and their evil alliance? Are they [words  indistinct]?    I think that it is necessary to give this matter very  careful  consideration. I do believe that after careful consideration, we  can see that it is because the DK enjoys the participation of  the entire nation and people in the struggle as it has always  stayed with them. To fight against the DK is tantamount to  fighting against the entire nation and people; therefore, the  latter has to join in the struggle both in the countryside and  in the cities. In such a situation, it is certainly not tanks  or artillery that is decisive.    [Correspondent] We would like to thank your excellency Mr.  chairman for this clear explanation to our compatriots. With  such a situation, what do you think about its solution?    [Khieu Samphan] The DK party's stand is well-known to  everyone, that is, national reconciliation in line with the  king's five-point policy. On this matter, I would like to speak  on the following two issues.    First: As far as the foreign powers who have interfered in  Cambodia's internal affairs and opposed national reconciliation  and the king's five-point policy guideline are concerned, is it  not about time for them to reconsider their position? Is it not  better to reach a solution that will enable Cambodia to regain  peace and national reconciliation in line with the king's  five-point political guideline, thus enabling Cambodia as well  as the whole of Southeast Asia to live in peace and their  relations to prosper on the basis of peace and mutual benefit?    Second: Concerning Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh and  the other FUNCINPEC leaders, I would like to sincerely propose  that you reconsider your current stand.    Have your highness and the other FUNCINPEC leaders been  aware  of what our nation and people have thought about your activities  in the recent past? People from all walks of life have  expressed their deep regret and have been wondering why  FUNCINPEC leaders have fallen into the bad policy of the  foreigners, have become friends with the henchmen of the  Vietnamese, have embraced the Hanoi Vietnamese communists, and  have waged war against their own Cambodian nation and people.  How have the FUNCINPEC leaders been misled by those with  Vietnamese minds and the Vietnamese communists themselves into  massacring their own fellow ANKI [National Army of Independent  Cambodia] and FUNCINPEC forces? They regret this so deeply.    If you are now aware of the fact, will you continue to  listen  to the foreigners or will you instead turn to listen to the  king's advice and heed the call of our nation and people?    I do believe that it is not too late yet. Our nation and  people are waiting for you and will not fail to support you.  Our nation and people want only peace and national  reconciliation.    His Majesty the King has issued the five-point policy  guideline because he is aware of the grave and explosive  situation in our country at present both in terms of national  and social issues. His five points come from his very careful  consideration. As he himself has been very close to our nation  and people, he understands the wishes of our nation and people  better than anyone.    Our entire Cambodian nation and people support the  five-point  political guideline of His Majesty the King. They want to see  all national forces reconciled and united both within the army  and in the government. They want to see all national forces  joined in one national army, that is within the framework of the  Khmer Royal Armed Forces. They want to see a genuine national  government so that there would be enough national forces to  tackle national and social issues, small and big alike.    The DK party fully supports His Majesty the King's  five-point  political guideline. I would like to stress here again that the  DK party does not want to eliminate any force or any  personality. But, the DK party will never allow anyone to  eliminate it.    The current situation clearly indicates that our nation and  people will not allow anyone to eliminate Democratic Kampuchea  or to continue to oppose national reconciliation.    In brief, I would like to say that the only way out is  national reconciliation in accordance with the king's five-point  political guideline.    [Correspondent] We would like to thank your excellency for  your explanation to our compatriots. We wish you happiness and  successes in your noble patriotic mission. Thank you.</p>

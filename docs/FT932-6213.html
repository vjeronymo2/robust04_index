			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / Britain attacked over bias against trade unionists BRITAIN WAS condemned by the International Labour Organisation yesterday for failing to provide effective legal protection for workers facing discrimination by employers because of trade union activities. This follows a complaint to the Geneva-based organisation in 1991 by the Trades Union Congress about a number of trade unionists who were unable to find a job or were dismissed for being on a recruitment blacklist compiled by the Economic League, an employer-funded organisation. The organisation's freedom of association committee ruled that Britain had breached convention 98 on the right of unions to organise without discrimination against their members, which it signed in 1949. The judgment has been ratified by the organisation's governing body. ILO conventions are not legally enforceable, but countries are not compelled to sign them and ministers will be embarrassed by the judgment. Yesterday's ruling is the ILO's ninth judgment against Britain since 1979 for breaching conventions of good labour practice. The organisation said in a statement that it was urging the government to extend an express protection in law against blacklisting or other forms of discrimination against workers who belong to trade unions or have been active in them in the past. It said: 'All practices involving the blacklisting of trade union officials or members constitutes a serious threat to the free exercise of trade union rights, and in general governments should take stringent measures to combat such practices.' The TUC had alleged that a number of workers had been unable to find work or had been dismissed by employers shortly after being hired because they appeared to be on a blacklist of militant trade unionists compiled by the Economic League. In response the government said the workers concerned had their rights fully covered by the 1990 Employment Act, which makes it unlawful for an employer to refuse to employ somebody because of being a trade unionist. It added that workers who felt victimised could use the civil law to gain redress. The government also pointed out that the activities of the Economic League were not unlawful. Mr Norman Willis, TUC general secretary, said yesterday that he had written to the new employment secretary Mr David Hunt urging him to act on the ILO decision. The TUC also intends to appeal to the organisation about the controversial new amendment that was rushed into the government's Trade Union Reform and Employment Rights Bill last week after its committee stage in the House of Lords. This amendment allows employers to discriminate against trade unionists by denying them pay increases if they refuse to sign personal contracts of employment. The TUC regards this as a serious threat to union rights. Mr Willis wrote to Mr Hunt: 'Following the logic of today's decision from the ILO, Britain would be committing a further violation of ILO convention 98 if it passed into law the amendment introduced into the bill earlier this week.'</p>

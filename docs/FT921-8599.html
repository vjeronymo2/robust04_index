			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Trilon Financial profits boosted to CDollars 109m for year TRILON Financial, a key holding company of the Peter and Edward Bronfman interests of Toronto, posted a sharp jump for 1991 profits because of better results by its financial services and property management affiliates. Earnings were CDollars 109m (Pounds 52.1m) or 74 cents a share, up from CDollars 59m a year earlier on revenues of CDollars 5.7bn against CDollars 6.2bn. London Insurance, one of Trilon's two biggest holdings, contributed CDollars 59m, unchanged, and Royal Trustco returned to profitability. Its earnings of CDollars 107m included CDollars 21m from an asset sale and its dividend is still not covered fully by profits. Moody's is reviewing Royal Trustco's long-term debt and may lower its rating. 'The review will focus on long-term earning capacity in relation to potential asset quality problems,' said the agency in New York. RT carries a single A-3 rating on its senior debt. Moody's also pointed to the impact of the recession in Ontario on RT's domestic business. Senior RT management told analysts in Toronto this week that the company's high level of non-performing loans in the past two years was due to the north America and UK recession. DBRS, one of Canada's two credit agencies, lowered its rating on O&amp;Y First Canadian Place debt from A-high to single A. The company owns the Reichmann Brothers' flagship Toronto office complex, which now has a 28 per cent vacancy rate. DBRS also reduced ratings on the bonds of several upper Olympia &amp; York Developments subsidiaries.</p>

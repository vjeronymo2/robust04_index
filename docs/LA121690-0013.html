			<p><P> December 16, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BABY BOOMERS RUNNING IN PLACE  </P> <P> If one considers popular beliefs that fuel ambition, one sees that most people  associate higher levels of authority with higher levels of pay. In fact, it is  more or less a universal managerial dogma in this country.  </P> <P> Even though, intuitively, it seems an obvious principle, it is not necessarily  rational. It stands in opposition to the market principle of supply-and-demand.  The market value for a particular type of supervisor may be lower than for the  employees he supervises. So organizations often create unnecessary credentials  or work-experience requirements to justify higher pay.  </P> <P> The traditional system incorrectly presumes that supervisorial and management  skills are of greater value to the organization's effectiveness and  profitability than are the skills being supervised. The value of a skill in one  organization may far exceed the overall market value for that same skill. And  the contribution of a supervisor is often measurable and less than the overall  market value for that skill. But, of course, an organization needs to at least  match the market or lose its employees.  </P> <P> It may be time that the rule of higher authority/higher pay change in the big  corporations. When it does, then "dead-ending" will no longer warrant  discussion.  </P> <P> W. SNOW HUME  </P> <P> West Hollywood  </P></p>

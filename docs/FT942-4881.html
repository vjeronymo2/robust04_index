			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / EU farmers try to come to terms with the new political landscape: The industry is deep in debate - and intensely worried - about the longer-term future of agricultural policy Mr Jean-Claude Debaudre, a Normandy dairy farmer, will be voting in this week's European elections to stop a foreign invasion. 'The borders are a sieve. Products like meat are coming into western Europe from Poland and the Czech Republic without health checks,' says Mr Debaudre, who is also president of the Normandy farmers' union. 'Sanitary conditions are very different in eastern Europe and they're putting those in western Europe at risk. We want real frontiers, on price and safety grounds.' Low-cost east European producers are not the only targets at which he wants his MEP to take aim. Currency fluctuations following the breakdown of the European monetary system have created 'distortions' in competition between member states, he says. While British farmers enjoyed a 60 per cent rise in their incomes last year, prices for French wheat producers dropped by up to a quarter. That is why Mr Debaudre favours a single currency, or at least tighter regulations. 'Farmers are very concerned about this. We want our candidates to commit themselves to it.' Short-term inequities, perceived or real, are high on the agenda at farmers' meetings with prospective MEPs. In both Britain and Denmark, for example, producers claim bitterly that they alone stick by the rules, filling in mountains of forms to comply with increasingly complex farm policies agreed in Brussels, while competitors elsewhere in the EU cheat and get away with it. But the elections also come at a time when the industry is deep in debate - and intensely worried - about the longer-term future of agricultural policy. Mr Jens Jakob Jakobsen, a large dairy farmer with 112 cows in Gangsted, northern Denmark, is arranging a series of farm visits for his local Euro-candidate, Ms Karen Riis Jorgensen. Farmers on the surrounding hills are much more interested in the election than people unconnected with the land, he believes. 'How can we say we don't care when so much of our future is set in Brussels?' His neighbours will turn out in force to talk to Ms Jorgensen, but they do not expect the young lawyer to have all the answers. 'Who can tell what will happen, even in the next six months? We're all a little uncertain about the outcome of common agricultural policy reforms and the Gatt,' Mr Jakobsen explains. The 1992 reforms of the CAP introduced direct payments to farmers as compensation for cuts in price support. This made the size of the subsidies more transparent and highlighted the cost of the CAP, which this year amounts to Ecu36.5bn (Pounds 28bn), or half the total EU budget. Pressure is on for further reductions in support when the reforms end in 1996, and farmers know it. Many also believe the sharp decline in the agricultural workforce - which has dropped by 26 per cent in the past decade - has lessened their lobbying power. Even in member states like Ireland, where nearly 14 per cent of the labour force is still farm-based, producers are aware they can no longer take taxpayers' money for granted. There are strains within the industry. Professor Wyn Grant, a specialist in agricultural policy at Britain's Warwick University, says that about a third of EU farmers are efficient enough to feel they could compete if subsidies were reduced or eliminated. 'The others recognise they would be forced out of business if subsidies did not continue,' he says. That split in their constituency helps explain why some farming organisations have produced European election manifestos demanding open-ended support from the taxpayer, while others accept the need for radical reform. For Mr Sjoerd Miedema, who runs a computerised dairy operation with 60 cows in Friesland, the Netherlands' main dairying region, the question is: what kind of reform? Given the high costs he faces to comply with environmental regulations, he does not want subsidies to be limited to keeping inefficient producers on marginal farmland. 'You'll get all kinds of farmers doing it as a hobby,' he says. 'That's not producing real money for the rural economy.' Mr Liam Foley is also an efficient dairy producer, but he farms in County Cork and is a senior official in the Irish Farmers' Association. The priority in Ireland, he says, is to concentrate payments on preventing rural decline. He will be voting with one eye on New Zealand, where agricultural subsidies were withdrawn virtually overnight in 1984. Fear that the Gatt deal liberalising world trade will eventually force the EU into open competition with highly efficient, low-cost food exporters is uppermost in many Irish farmers' minds. 'The large, efficient Irish producer could live with that, but the 35,000 dairy farms in Ireland would quite quickly be reduced to 10,000 in a totally free market,' he says. 'New Zealand dairy farms have an average herd of 160 cows. The average in Ireland is 25 to 30 cows. The social consequences are very, very serious for this country.' He is also worried about the impact on peripheral member states if east European countries join the EU. 'The Germans are the main contributors to the EU budget and it will be more beneficial for them to contribute to the economies of the east,' he says. 'That will mean far less money from the EU coming into a country like Ireland through structural funds.' If subsidies are to continue as a way of propping up rural economies, then Mr Foley expects public pressure to ensure that environmental conditions are attached to them. Mr Willy Gorlach, the German agriculture spokesman for the Socialist group in the last European parliament, argues that support should be targeted at farmers who adopt less intensive, 'greener' methods. Standing for re-election, Mr Gorlach attacks the way the current CAP reforms oblige farmers to leave 15 per cent of their arable land idle as 'set-aside' while allowing intensive crop-growing to continue on the remaining 85 per cent. 'It's not just the farmers' task to produce food,' he says. 'People should recognise that farmers have to produce the landscape, they have to protect nature, they have to protect our drinking water. As long as prices for food products fall because of overproduction, we need payments for farmers so they can respond to society's demands for landscape and nature.'</p>

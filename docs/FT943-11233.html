			<p>940801 FT  01 AUG 94 / Confidence rises at tin mine Britain's last operating tin mine, South Crofty, near Redruth in Cornwall, had by the weekend been promised only Pounds 300,000 towards the Pounds 1m it must raise this week under the terms of a survival package agreed with the government. Nevertheless, the management was optimistic. Mr Howard Midwinter, a director of South Crofty, said: 'After a slow start, things are picking up. We have moved from being optimistic to confident that we can make it.' Mr Kevin Ross, managing director, made an emotional appeal to investors on June 29 to provide up to Pounds 1.8m for South Crofty, which can trace its roots back for 400 of the 2,500 years that tin has been mined in Cornwall. He revealed that, if the mine could raise the minimum Pounds 1m to ensure its survival for another 18 months, the government would write off loans totalling Pounds 23.4m. Also the RTZ Corporation, which sold South Crofty and its sister mine Wheal Jane to management and employees in 1985, would forgive loans of Pounds 7.7m. The loans are interest-free but their presence on the balance sheet makes it hard for South Crofty to raise money. South Crofty employs 260 people - most of them have taken regular cuts in pay to help the mine survive so far - and produces about 2,200 tonnes of tin a year. The share sale prospectus shows a pre-tax loss of Pounds 42,000 on turnover of Pounds 6.5m last year compared with a profit of Pounds 79,000 on Pounds 6m of sales in 1992.</p>

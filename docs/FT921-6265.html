			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / International Company News: Management reshuffle at Bank Austria BANK Austria, Austria's largest bank, is pushing through a big top management reshuffle following heavy losses at the bank's London and New York branches. The bank, formed through the merger of Landerbank and Zentralsparkasse last year, announced on Wednesday that two managing board members, Mr Manfred Drennig and Mr Konrad Rumpold, would step down immediately, while Mr Herbert Cordt, former board member, would leave his post as manager of an energy subsidiary. Mr Helmut Zilk, Vienna's mayor and chairman of the bank's supervisory board, said the bank might demand financial restitution from the three men. Bank Austria has already announced plans for a Sch5bn (Dollars 431m) charge against 1991 profits, because of losses in the UK and the US. The takeover of the British leasing company, Sovereign, in 1990 could alone cost the bank Sch1bn. An internal report contends that Landerbank officials should have known that Sovereign was effectively bankrupt at the time. The three managers were responsible for Landerbank's foreign business in the 1980s. The move removes all Landerbank executives from the board and leaves the management of Bank Austria in the hands of former Zentralsparkasse personnel. Other Austrian banks are also facing huge losses from foreign loans made during the 1980s. Critics say the banks were poorly prepared for this business and did not apply adequate supervision of their foreign branches.</p>

			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / International Company News: Honda put under credit review by S&amp;P THE credit rating of Honda, the Japanese car group, was yesterday placed under review for a possible downgrade by Moody's, the international credit rating agency. The move was expected, following last month's announcement by Standard &amp; Poor's that it is reviewing the credit ratings of Honda, as well as Nissan and Toyota, because of poor domestic demand and the damage to export price competitiveness inflicted by the yen's strength. Moody's gave similar reasons for reviewing Honda, which reported a 41 per cent profits fall in the year to June. Honda's exports form a higher proportion of total sales than is the case for Nissan and Toyota. The agency said it would examine the group's ability to use its US and European plants to offset the erosion of its price competitiveness outside Japan. It would study the implications of this strategy for Honda's domestic manufacturing and employment base and assess the outlook for new car launches.</p>

			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / Finance &amp; The Family (The Budget and You): Waiting game - Married couples WOMEN will have to wait to be certain that they will benefit from one of the measures in Norman Lamont's Budget. His proposal to allow the transferability of the married couple's allowance has not made it into the Finance Act and so cannot become law under the present government. The change was not due to take effect until April 6 1993 in any case, so there should be time for it to be enacted if the Conservatives are re-elected. And Labour would probably implement the provision, if it wins. Despite the introduction of independent taxation in 1990, the husband has continued to receive the married couple's allowance - hence its description by some working wives as the male chauvinist allowance, to use Lamont's quip. Under Lamont's Budget proposal, married couples would choose who should receive the allowance, or split it equally between them. If they did nothing, the husband would continue to receive it. At the moment, the allowance cannot be transferred to the wife unless the husband's income is less than his total allowances (when he would be unable to use it). The allowance is Pounds 1,720 for the 1991-2 tax year. This rate remains unchanged for 1992-93. If you are a married working woman, should you elect to receive the allowance? The one case in which it would be clearly to your advantage to do so is if you are a higher-rate taxpayer and your husband is being taxed at 25 per cent. This is because the threshold at which you are taxed at a higher rate will be raised. Few couples are in this situation, though. Only 2.47 per cent of higher-rate taxpayers are married women. Inland Revenue figures for 1991-92 show there are 1.62m higher-rate taxpayers, of whom only 40,000 are wives. Many of these are likely to have husbands who are also higher-rate taxpayers. So, the number of couples who would find the change of material benefit to them is small. If, however, both husband and wife are in the same tax band, splitting the allowance between them would mean that the base from which they are taxed will become level. At the moment, the husband benefits more than the wife, since he gets more tax relief. By splitting the allowance, the wife would be better off - but it will make no difference to the couple's collective income. Where the husband is in a higher tax band than the wife, a couple will be better off if he continues to receive the allowance. The declaration can be made on a form which tax offices are expected to issue in the summer, if the law is enacted by the new government. Wives would be able to claim half the allowance by right. The arrangement made would hold until another declaration was made, and the change in allocation would take place at the start of the following tax year. Married couples who are claiming a higher allowance because one or other is more than 65 would only be able to transfer a maximum of Pounds 1,720.</p>

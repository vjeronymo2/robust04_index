			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article] </F>   [Text] Jose de Castro, a Mozambique National Resistance  [Renamo] official heading his movement's preparations for the  electoral process, told NOTICIAS that it was in a gesture of  goodwill that his party granted three out of 13 available seats  in the STAE [Elections Administration Technical Secretariat] to  all political parties excluding the Mozambique Liberation Front  [Frelimo].    The STAE is made up of 50 members, 50 percent of which are  from the government, 25 from the United Nations, and the  remaining percentage for all political parties excluding Frelimo.    Jose de Castro said the unarmed opposition parties are  ungrateful when they demand seats in the STAE, since during the  debate on Electoral Law they said they renounced their right to  fill the seats in that electoral organ in favor of the  government.    Jose de Castro stated that Renamo fought for those seats  and,  today, the unarmed opposition parties are demanding the seats we  fought for until we achieved victory. They are ungrateful. He  added that the unarmed opposition should recognize the efforts  made by Renamo, beginning with the negotiations in Rome, through  the donors' conference, and up to the multiparty conference, to  defend the interests of the unarmed parties in the process of  the country's democratization.    He said that Renamo is surprised by the attitude of these  political parties. Recognizing their political immaturity,  however, we are going to grant them only three seats.    Castro said that he had already foreseen a controversy over  this issue. And for this reason, he presented to the government  a draft list with 13 members.    He said, we do not see any problem with this. We will have  to sacrifice three of our members in STAE in favor of the  unarmed opposition.    Meanwhile, a source from the unarmed opposition parties  yesterday told our reporter that he is not happy with the three  seats granted by Renamo, and he thinks Renamo should grant a  minimum of four seats.    Confronted with this situation, Jose de Castro said Renamo  has done its best and it will not do the impossible.    He said, we have granted them three seats, this is all we  can  do.    Meanwhile, the unarmed opposition seems to be a little  divided, because Wehia Ripua, leader of Pademo [Mozambique  Democratic Party], who was questioned on the issue, said his  party is not interested in having seats in the STAE or the  National Elections Commission.    Ripua said that, for Pademo, the most important thing is  ensuring that these electoral organs operate fully so that the  unarmed opposition parties, which are the less privileged in  this process, operate normally. Why should there be a  controversy over this process? Pademo is against this.    The unarmed opposition is expected to meet soon to map out  its strategy over this issue.</p>

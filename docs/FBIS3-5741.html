			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 10 KYODO -- French Trade Minister  Gerard Longuet on Thursday [10 March] criticized Washington's  retaliatory trade policy against Japan. The global community  regards Japan's huge trade surplus as "a problem" for the world,  but resorting to steps like Super 301 is an "overreaction,"  Longuet said.    Longuet made the remarks in his meeting with his Japanese  counterpart Hiroshi Kumagai.    France and other European countries are against trade  policies accompanied by sanctions, Longuet said. "Such a step  is unlikely to solve problems on a long-term basis."    Kumagai said Japan will not leave unattended the soured  economic ties with the United States following the breakdown of  trade "framework" talks in February.    Longuet called for global economic cooperation with Japan in  such fields as automobiles, aircraft and energy. He also  proposed Japan and other Asian countries step up cooperation for  industrial development.    Kumagai shared the view with the French trade minister, who  arrived Tuesday for a visit lasting through Sunday.</p>

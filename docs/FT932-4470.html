			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / People: From Capel to headhunting James Fergusson, who resigned from James Capel in April, has picked up his first non-executive directorship, as chairman of headhunters Stephens Consultancies, run by chief executive and founder Fiona Stephens. 'Fiona picked up the phone quick as a flash as soon as she heard I was leaving' says Fergusson, 50, adding that the two have known each other for 20 years. While, as a fresh-faced headhunter, he would be too discrete to say so, Capel is presumably a longstanding client of Stephens. Fergusson resigned from his position as managing director after what he calls a 'little row' with Capel parent Hongkong Bank group. Capel had incurred losses of up to Pounds 16m on an eastern European venture capital fund, New Europe Hotels, shares in which were sold mainly out of New York; Fergusson had been in charge of Capel's international operations. Following New Europe, the bank was anxious to keep a low profile in the US, Fergusson explains. 'They regarded us as a bit aggressive - though I think the rules of the game in the US are a bit different.' He says that at 50, and with four youngish children, he would not have wanted to put in long City hours for much longer. Stephens, meanwhile, was looking for a chairman for the first time. 'It was felt the business had got very large and it was necessary to bring some sort of discipline to bear,' says Fergusson. He adds that, in his one day a week, he will fulfil 'a mildly executive role'. The specialised headhunter operates in New York and Hong Kong as well as London and Edinburgh. For Fergusson, who joined Capel in 1969 as a food analyst, says that his next ideal job would be on the board of a food manufacturer planning to go public in the next two to three years.</p>

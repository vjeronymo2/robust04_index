			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Move on Wm Low awaited Bid fever was mounting in the food retail sector yesterday with strong hints that J Sainsbury, Britain's biggest supermarket group, would launch its much-vaunted bid for Scottish retailer William Low shortly, perhaps this morning. Low, which is already subject to a Pounds 154m agreed offer from Tesco, saw its shares surge as the speculation grew, ending the session 12 ahead at 280p on turnover of 3.1m. The market was divided over Sainsbury's potential tactics, some specialists predicting a blockbusting 300p-a-share offer to knock Tesco out of the frame. Others were suggesting a 'no-lose' scenario for Sainsbury, whereby the group would make a spoiling bid above Tesco's 225p-a-share which would either force Tesco into a counter bid at a higher price, or deliver Low's at a reasonable one. Sources close to Tesco said that the company would respond robustly to any Sainsbury offer and that a bidding war appeared inevitable. 'Tesco do not like losing,' said one well-placed source. The prize of William Low would give the winner critical mass in Scotland, where both are under-represented. Sainsbury shares traded erratically on the rumours, ending the day a penny down at 410p. Tesco added 3 1/2 to 240p.</p>

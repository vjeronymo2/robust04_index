			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Mexico City, 27 Dec (NOTIMEX) -- Mexico today  promulgated the Border Ecological Cooperation Commission  [Comision de Cooperation Ecologica Fronteriza] and the North  American Development Bank [Banco de Desarrollo de America del  Norte] that will start operating on 1 January 1994 with the  implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement  [NAFTA].    The decree promulgating the agreement between the two  countries established that the goal of the commission and the  bank is to support the protection and upgrading of the  environment at the U.S.- Mexican border.    The agreement creating the two institutions was approved by  the Chamber of Senators on 16 December and was promulgated today  through its publication in the federation's official newspaper.  The text of the agreement underscores the importance of  preserving, protecting, and improving the environment for the  sake of present-day and future generations and the urgency of  addressing ecological problems at the U.S.-Mexican border. The  United States and Mexico agreed to create the commission and the  bank within the framework of NAFTA, which includes Canada. The  U.S. Government promulgated NAFTA on 8 December.    The agreement underscores the need to establish an  ecological  infrastructure at the border, especially in contaminated areas,  as well as the need to treat sewage water and solid waste, among  others. The agreement states that the commission's goal is to  support the preservation, protection, and improvement of ecology  at the border area to increase the well-being of the people of  Mexico and the United States. The commission will also  cooperate, as required, with the North American Development  Bank, other national and international institutions, and sources  of private investment capital in the development of ecological  infrastructure projects in the area.    The commission will participate in the drafting,  development,  implementation, and supervision of those projects and will  analyze the financial or environmental feasibility of such  plans, and will evaluate the economic and social benefits of  ecological infrastructure projects in the area.    The commission will have a directorate, two managers, that  is, a general manager and a deputy general manager, an advisory  council, as well as the officials and personnel it requires to  carry out its duties. It will also have legal status and full  power to sign contracts, purchase and transfer personal property  and real estate, and start legal procedures.    The commission will issue a yearly report on its operations  in Spanish and English that will be drafted by the general  manager and approved by the directorate. Copies of the report  will be available to the people of the two countries. The  commission will be in operation until one of the parties decides  to withdraw, and this party is able to do so six months after  filing a written request.    The North American Development Bank will finance projects  certified by and at the request of the commission and will be  assisted by the commission in the achievement of its goals and  fulfillment of its duties. In carrying out its duties the bank  will use its own capital, funds obtained in financial markets  and other available resources, and will promote the investment  of public and private capital in companies and activities with  ecological purposes.    The agreement states that the bank will have initial capital  of $3 billion divided into 300,000 shares, each one with a  nominal value of $10,000, and they will be at the disposal of  the parties. Of that total, there will be $450 million in  paid-up shares [liberadas] and $2.550 billion in not fully  paid-up shares [pagaderas]. The agreement states that Mexico  and the United States each will own [suscribiran] 22,500 paid-up  shares and 127,500 not fully paid-up shares for a total of  150,000 shares each and a grand total of 300,000 shares between  the two.</p>

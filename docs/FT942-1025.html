			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / Any other business? Wider and deeper Union on the cards: European leaders did make progress on non-Dehaene matters Although the Corfu summit ended in ill-tempered chaos because of EU leaders' failure to agree on a successor to Mr Jacques Delors, they did, amid the Ionian splendour and balmy weather, get some work done. The summit set an agenda for further 'widening' of the EU to east and south, and set in train preparations for 'deepening' integration at the 1996 Maastricht review conference. In the follow-up to the Delors White Paper on jobs, competitiveness and growth, endorsed by last December's Brussels summit, the heads of government signed up to a balanced package of 'an open economy. . . geared to solidarity': flexible labour markets and deregulation on the one hand but, on the other, assured finance for trans-European infrastructure and a 10-gun salute for the elected works councils in pan-European companies that all member states except the UK agreed to set up last week. The summit began by putting in place four more building blocks in the construction of post-communist Europe. The leaders of Austria, Finland, Sweden and Norway signed their accession treaties to the Union, aimed at bringing them in next year. Austrians this month approved entry in a referendum, but the three Nordic countries still face difficult plebiscites on membership this autumn. The summit conclusions therefore devoted praise to the newcomers, 'in the vanguard of the efforts to promote environmental and social protection, transparency and open government, areas considered essential by a large part of the Union's citizens' in this month's Euro-elections. The EU was self-critical of its own feeble measures on open government, stating that these 'require further elaboration'. The partnership and free trade agreement with Russia signed at Corfu, described by British Prime Minister John Major as 'the most comprehensive agreement ever concluded between the Union and any other country', followed the similar agreement signed with Ukraine in Luxembourg last week. Unexpectedly, the 12 put a figure, of Ecu500m (Pounds 385m), on the aid they are willing to provide Ukraine to shut down the Chernobyl nuclear plant and replace them through the completion of three (rather than, as expected, five) nuclear reactors already under construction. The controversial plan is placed in the framework of 'adequate safety standards', effective measures on electricity pricing, energy saving and alternative energy sources, and the ratification of the Vienna convention on nuclear liability. The Ecu500m looks like the opening EU bid, to encourage the US and Japan to stump up serious funding for the plan at next month's Group of Seven summit in Naples. Third, the summit welcomed the membership applications this spring from Hungary and Poland, and affirmed that the association agreements with these two countries and the Czech and Slovak republics would be used to propel them towards entry. The summit approved a similar agreement with Slovenia, and set itself the goal of extending this umbrella eventually to the Baltic states. Fourth, and to the satisfaction of the EU's Greek hosts, the summit stated that 'the next phase of enlargement of the Union will involve Cyprus and Malta', subject to the resolution of the Cyprus conflict. This is also subject to success in the 1996 constitutional review of EU decision-making, presented at Corfu as a precondition for further enlargement. To this end, the summit created a 'reflection group' to begin work in June next year on 'the weighting of votes, the threshold for qualified majority decisions, number of members of the Commission' and any other reform 'deemed necessary to facilitate the work of the (EU) institutions and guarantee their effective operation in the perspective of enlargement'. The main participants in this group will be named by foreign ministers of the 12 and the Commission president. But Germany and the Benelux countries overcame British and French objections to letting in the European Parliament, two representatives of which 'will participate in'  - rather than merely 'be associated with' - the group's work. Mr Kohl wants Mr Delors to chair the group, a move likely to be resisted by the UK should the outgoing Brussels chief assent. In the White Paper discussion, the summit called for all increases in productivity to the end of the century to be ploughed back into investment and jobs, and more effort to reduce non-wage labour costs. Shifting some of these costs on to the environment reappeared on the EU wish-list, with the summit 'taking note' of the still stalled EU discussion on carbon and energy taxes. The conclusions endorsed a fast-track approach to liberalising energy and telecommunications networks. It also agreed on a priority list of 11 trans-European transport links, including high-speed train links across the channel, through Austria's Brenner pass, and from France south to Spain and Italy and north to Germany. A list of energy projects will be studied further. The controversy over raising additional EU funding for these predominantly privately or nationally funded projects appears more or less resolved. The summit 'confirms that measures will be taken - if proved necessary - in order that priority projects do not run into financial obstacles that would jeopardise their implementation'. This victory for Mr Delors was followed by two others: the reaffirmation of the EU 'social dimension' as an indispensable corollary to the single market; and the deal to name a minister in each member state responsible for co-ordinating all aspects of information technology development, a main theme of the white paper. The deregulators, led by Germany and the UK, got their task force as well. This will do a cost-benefit analysis of not only EU but national legislation to weed out obstacles to jobs and competitiveness. But it will be run by the Commission and can be expected to focus strongly on national red tape. Looking forward to the successive German and French EU presidencies, the summit endorsed the Franco-German call for a global strategy to combat racism and xenophobia in Europe, with a timetable running up to next June's summit. The conclusions draw a veil over the Delors succession crisis, but note that the recent Euro-elections gave clear warning that 'the Union will be judged by its citizens' on the strength of the measures it takes to defend their jobs and security.</p>

In  recent years, the technology in gene rearrangement has shown  remarkable progress. It is in such technology that much is  dependent on producing microorganisms and plants that can be  applied to preserving the environment. The symposium consisted  of lectures, research reports, and panel discussions by  experienced scholars in genetic engineering. Debates in depth  were made on the applications of microorganisms and plants  towards environmental preservation and the values it held for  environmental influence.    A keynote lecture titled ``We are depending on the genetic  engineering technology for plants'' was given. Professor Akira  Watanabe of University of Nagoya, Bio-Molecular Question &amp;  Answer Research Center said, ``The genetic engineering  technology centered around the field of food application has  progressed. With the completion of the laboratory wing, we are  depending on the exploration of new fields in the genetic  engineering technology''.    The research presentations continued with ``The development  of plants that can resist air pollution'' (Kuro Kondo, ditto  Research Center, New Bio Product Evaluation Study Team Aggregate  Research Official), ``The purification of trichloroethylene  pollution using microorganisms'' (Osami Yagi, ditto Research  Center, Water Environmental Quality Research Project Leader),  and four other research reports on the present state of  biotechnology in environmental preservation were presented.    In addition, in the panel discussion of ``The public  acceptance of microorganism utilization for environmental  control'', the degree of public penetration of genetic  engineered bio-products that are on the market and also  biotechnology itself were discussed. It has been generally  acknowledged that our countrys knowledge of biotechnology has  been affirmative and interesting comments from the panel such as  ``In Japan, we do not see as much resistance to products that  have been genetically engineered as in Europe or the United  States. Also the oppositions are not as philosophical (as the  Europeans)'', and ``Dont forget that Japan was the first country  to use genetically engineered detergent'', were being reported.</p>

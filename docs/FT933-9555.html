			<p>930809 FT  09 AUG 93 / International Company News: Thai farming group rises to Bt337m for quarter CHAROEN Pokphand Feedmill (CPF), the main Bangkok-listed agri-industrial and aquaculture company of the multinational CP group, has announced a rise in second-quarter net profits, to Bt337.48m (Dollars 13.5m) from Bt293.08m in the same quarter last year. A poor first quarter, however, has left first-half net profits at only Bt493.10m, compared with Bt596.65m in the the first half of 1992. Stockbrokers in Bangkok are wary of reading too much into the figures because of the complex links between the group's public companies and its large private interests. However they say prawn feed sales were hit earlier in the year by disease in Thai prawn farms. The chicken feed business has suffered from sharp falls in the export price of frozen chickens over the last 18 months, partly as a result of increased competition from China.</p>

			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Reward only demonstrated talent Sir, Executive remuneration has been put firmly back in the public eye. At the heart of this subject lies the need to understand what executives are there for. As Edward Lawler suggested (Management: 'New logic is here to stay', January 28), the value that people add justifies their pay. Executives need to add to shareholder value - hence Reuters' scheme ('Pioneering package from Reuters', February 1). Unless executives' rewards are tied to the quality of their decisions in satisfying this need, we should not be surprised that they can earn more money while company performance stagnates or declines. PA Consulting Group's recent survey on executive rewards found that chief executives who actively subscribe to the notion that executive pay should be closely aligned to shareholder interests are from companies with a market to book ratio 50 per cent higher than those where shareholder interest is not a significant determinant of executive pay. Other results from the survey indicate the simplistic orthodoxy of 'paying the market rate' goes hand in hand with significant under-performance. Shareholders should only pay for demonstrated talent, not the hope or illusion of talent. Such talent makes the best choices in the allocation of the company's financial, human and technological resources. The tragedy is that good executives have inadequate incentive to utilise their talents to the full. Executive remuneration will remain a hot potato until it is firmly based on demonstrated added value. Something-for-nothing share options and other paraphernalia of the current orthodoxy do not satisfy this criterion.

			<p><P> August 28, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GROUP TO ABANDON CRIME-RIDDEN AREA;  </P> <P> URBAN DECAY: THE L.A. COUNTY MEDICAL ASSN. HAS PUT ITS HEADQUARTERS NEAR  MACARTHUR PARK UP FOR SALE, CITING DRUG ADDICTS WHO HAVE TAKEN OVER THE AREA.  </P> <P> Besieged by panhandlers and drug addicts, the Los Angeles County Medical Assn.  has put its 58-year-old headquarters building near MacArthur Park up for sale.  </P> <P> The sprawling 130,000-square-foot facility, which houses the Regional Poison  Control Center and a library of rare medical books, employs 85 people and  covers two-thirds of a city block near the crime-plagued corner of Wilshire  Boulevard and Westlake Avenue.  </P> <P> "Our members and employees are being attacked," said Dr. Gary Krieger, chairman  of the board of trustees for the nonprofit organization of 10,000 physicians.  "We've already literally turned our parking facility into a fortress and have  armed guards on duty at all times.  </P> <P> "In talking to growth experts about the future of development in this area,"  added Krieger, "there is no reason to believe it will change appreciably any  time soon."  </P> <P> The loss of the association, one of the last major employers left in the  vicinity of MacArthur Park, is a further erosion of the economic base in the  Westlake community.  </P> <P> In July, the owners of a MacArthur Park landmark restaurant, Edward's Steak  House, closed the establishment, driven out, they said, by crime and drug  trafficking.  </P> <P> The medical organization's decision to move comes two weeks after a personal  plea from Councilwoman Gloria Molina to forestall the sale until city policies  to upgrade the community with new street lights and street and alley  maintenance, among other things, can begin to take effect.  </P> <P> But officials of the association said the three buildings that make up the  outdated facility are in desperate need of at least $4 million in repairs.  </P> <P> Beyond that, the officials fear that Molina wants to maintain the area as a  low-income refuge for immigrants and small shop owners, which could stymie any  plans to redevelop the property to attract high-end businesses and tenants.  </P> <P> As it stands, the streets and alleys surrounding MacArthur Park have become a  haven for up to 600 crack cocaine addicts driven out of the 30-acre park  grounds by law enforcement officials on horses, bicycles and on foot.  </P> <P> Dr. Richard Corlin, a trustee for the association, said the decision to leave  was not an easy one.  </P> <P> "I'm as concerned about low-income housing and restoring the business element  as she (Molina) is," Corlin said. "But unfortunately, her policies overlook  certain economic realities."  </P> <P> Molina could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> Gutierrez said that despite some business problems in the area, there are many  improvements, ranging from a community task force to identify and remedy  neighborhood ailments to beefed-up police patrols. These, and other efforts,  however, will take time, she said.  </P> <P> The trustees of the association voted May 9 to put the property up for sale but  held off on going public with the plan until now.  </P> <P> "Nearly every building on our street is up for sale," said association staff  member Brad Kuiper. "Heck, we may not even be able to sell this place."  </P> <P> Added association spokesman Bob Calverley: "There are a lot of people in this  neighborhood who can't leave and I feel sorry for them. The vast majority of  those who live here, however, are not crack addicts; they are working people  who just can't afford to move."  </P></p>

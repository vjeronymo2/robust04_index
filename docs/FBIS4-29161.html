			<p>BFN     [Text] Australia has warned the South Pacific to improve  its economic performance in a speech in Sydney by Pacific  Affairs Minister Gordon Bilney. In Australia's first policy  statement on the Pacific since the end of the Cold War, Mr.  Bilney warns that donor countries cannot continue giving aid if  Pacific island governments don't pursue high economic growth.  Mr. Bilney said past policies had not worked despite large  injections of aid and growth is still low, unlike comparable  Caribbean economies. Mr. Bilney said the South Pacific must  urgently face problems like population explosion and  deforestation to avoid a nightmare vision of mass unemployment,  urban slums, and lawlessness. Among the most controversial  areas in Australia's policy advice is selling off indebted  national airlines and filling up land, which are generally held  in commune to attract foreign investment.</p>

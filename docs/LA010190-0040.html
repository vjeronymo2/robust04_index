			<p><P> January 1, 1990, Monday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> RIVERSIDE TEEN-AGERS HELD AFTER 125-MILE CHASE IN STOLEN CAR  </P> <P> A 14-year-old Riverside boy was arrested early Sunday after leading police on a  125-mile, high-speed chase in a stolen car before finally running out of gas  north of the Santa Clarita Valley, authorities said.  </P> <P> The youth's 16-year-old girlfriend, a passenger, also was taken into custody  following the chase, which began about 1:45 a.m. in Riverside, said Sgt. Mark  Lunn of the California Highway Patrol.  </P> <P> Riverside police attempted to stop the 1987 blue Mazda 323 after spotting the  stolen vehicle at Washington Street and Overlook Parkway, Lunn said. But the  car sped away, heading north on Washington Street, Lunn said.  </P> <P> The pursuit continued to the westbound Riverside Freeway, where the California  Highway Patrol took over the chase, which proceeded north on the Santa Ana  Freeway at speeds of up to 110 m.p.h.  </P> <P> The chase continued through the San Fernando Valley and into the Santa Clarita  Valley, where the couple left the freeway and headed west on Templin Highway,  then north on The Old Road before running out of gas about 3 a.m., Lunn said.  </P> <P> The two were arrested on suspicion of grand theft auto, possessing stolen  property, evading arrest, being a minor in possession of alcohol and for not  wearing seat belts, Lunn said. The boy also was arrested on suspicion of being  an unlicensed driver, Lunn said.  </P> <P> The boy told authorities that he stole the car before picking up his girlfriend  at her Riverside home to go for a ride, Lunn said.  </P> <P> The youths, whose names were withheld because of their ages, are being held at  Sylmar Juvenile Hall, he said.  </P></p>

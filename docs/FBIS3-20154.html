The clash started when gunmen, fleeing after throwing a bomb  at the election office of the pro-Islamic Welfare [Prosperity]  Party, fired on police, who urged them to surrender. One of the  gunmen was killed, the others fled.    Five other people, including a 12-year-old boy, were killed  and 26 were wounded in the last couple of days in several  assaults on party offices and candidates in the run-up to  Sunday's nationwide municipal elections.</p>

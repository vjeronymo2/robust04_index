We know of the government's intentions to arm paramilitary  groups to hinder the movement, but we will remain alert, Lara  added.    Lara was interviewed while heading a protest march. He also  said the National Assembly of Health Employees will conduct an  analytical and scientific study to determine the causes of the  death of patient Miriam Catalina Rodriguez de Alvizurez outside  the emergency ward of Roosevelt Hospital.    Lara said he agrees with other union leaders who have said  the president of the Republic and the Army commanding general  are directly responsible for the patient's death.</p>

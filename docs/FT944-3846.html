			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / Minister rejects 44-tonne trucks The government yesterday rejected a recommendation to increase the maximum size of trucks to 44 tonnes. Some 44-tonne trucks used in road-rail operations are already allowed on the roads and a House of Lords committee had recommended an overall increase for all vehicles from the current 38 tonnes. But Mr Steven Norris, transport minister, turned down the recommendation, saying that 'while there would be some savings in lorry numbers, the effect that 44-tonne lorries would have on existing rail freight and the intermodal services through the Channel tunnel still needs detailed evaluation'.</p>

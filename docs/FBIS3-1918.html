			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "News" program] </F>   [Text] Economic Minister P. K. Chiang stated on Tuesday [2  March], when answering questions from lawmakers in the  Legislative Yuan, that to ensure economic development, raise  industrial competitiveness, and lower production costs, the  Economic Ministry is clear about the state of relations between  the two sides of the Taiwan Strait and will keep the ties more  or less at the present level. However, Chiang said that serious  discussions must be carried out on point-to-point direct  navigation links and even in an across-the-board opening of  navigation and aviation links in the future. However, Chiang  stressed that since the opening of navigation links between the  two sides is covered in the medium- term-part of the national  unification guideline, any research done on this issue and the  results coming from them should be forwarded to the Mainland  Affairs Council for reference. He said that the result will be  help to policy makers when the time comes for further opening up  of ties between the two sides.</p>

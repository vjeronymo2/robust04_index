			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / Delay in shares report may hit Archer's hopes The Department of Trade and Industry is still waiting for the inspectors' report into the share dealing in connection with which Lord Archer, the former Conservative deputy chairman, was named. Lord Archer had hoped that he would be cleared before the coming reshuffle, enabling the prime minister to bring him back into the government. The department has acknowledged the need to settle the affair as soon as possible. However, in reply to a written question from Mr Robin Cook, Labour's trade and industry spokesman, the department is expected to say today that it has still not received the inspectors' report. It is expected to reveal that informal discussions have taken place between the department and the inspectors. The department believes it was unfortunate that Lord Archer's name was leaked and would like to clear the best-selling novelist as soon as possible if, as expected, the report shows no wrongdoing by him. But ministers are determined that no pressure should be brought on the inspectors to conclude their report before they are ready. That means Lord Archer may have to wait until after the reshuffle before being cleared. Such a delay would undermine his chances of joining the government. He was widely believed to be a candidate for a junior ministerial post, such as sports minister. The investigation, launched in February, centres on share dealing in Anglia TV before an agreed takeover bid which sent shares soaring. Lord Archer's wife, Mary, is a non-executive director of Anglia. The department has refused to discuss details of the inquiry but it is understood to involve a single transaction involving 30,000 shares and a profit of about Pounds 50,000. In a Commons written answer yesterday Mr Neil Hamilton, trade and industry minister, said seven reports by the department's inspectors completed since 1983 had never been published.</p>

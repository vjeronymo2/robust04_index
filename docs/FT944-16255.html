			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / Lottery rapped on fundraising efficiency A leading fundraiser has attacked the National Lottery as one of the least cost-efficient ways of raising money for good causes ever devised. The attack came from Mr Henry Drucker, former director of Campaign for Oxford, which raised Pounds 341m in the biggest philanthropic campaign ever undertaken by a British institution. Mr Drucker, a visiting professor at the London School of Economics, told the Royal Society of Arts that after prizes, taxes, costs and promoters' profits, just 25 per cent would go to the good causes. A survey for the National Council of Voluntary Organisations in 1992 suggested that there could be an annual loss of donations of Pounds 428m to the lottery. Religious, educational and medical charities had been excluded in favour of the five nominated beneficiaries - the arts, charities, a millennium fund, national heritage and sport. The National Lottery also represented a centralising of power, he added. Mr Drucker said: 'One donor (the state through its instruments) will decide the allocation of a much-increased proportion of the charities' support.' ICL, a member of the Camelot consortium that will launch the National Lottery on November 19, said it was on schedule to install about 10,000 terminals and train 37,000 retail staff for Monday November 14, when tickets go on sale.</p>

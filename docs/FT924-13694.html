			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / International Company News: Sprint goes ahead as volume of calls rises SPRINT, the third-largest long-distance telecommunications group in the US, yesterday reported an 18.5 per cent increase in third-quarter net income, helped by record long-distance volume and operating income. Net income was Dollars 115m, or 52 cents a share, on revenues of Dollars 2.33bn, compared with income of Dollars 97m, or 44 cents a share, in the same period last year on revenues of Dollars 2.21bn. The latest figures excluded a Dollars 6m charge for the early retirement of debt. Long-distance operating income was Dollars 94m, up from Dollars 90m a year ago, mainly because of increased revenues, which grew 6.2 per cent from the third quarter of 1991, to Dollars 1.43bn, and 3.9 per cent, compared with the second quarter of this year. Long-distance use was up 6.9 per cent on a year ago and 3.2 per cent compared with the second quarter. The company attributed the increases to 'marketing and product strengths and operational improvements developed over the last several quarters'. For the nine months, the group reported net income of Dollars 309m, or Dollars 1.40 a share, compared with Dollars 269m, or Dollars 1.23 a share in 1991.</p>

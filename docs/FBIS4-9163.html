			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "an" and "knysz": "Cease-Fire at the Top; </F> Neither Rosati Nor Borowski for Finance Minister?"]    [Text] During yesterday's meeting with the deputies'  club of the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD], Lech Walesa agreed  to the introduction of deputy ministers from the coalition to  the Defense Ministry [MON], the Internal Affairs Ministry [MSW],  and the Foreign Ministry [MSZ]. But he did not change his mind  on Rosati.    Up to now, the president has successfully resisted attempts  by the SLD and the Polish Peasant Party [PSL], who want to have  their deputy ministers in the so-called Belweder ministries. "We  cannot have a situation where every coalition will have its own  ministers," Walesa repeated yesterday.    SLD leader Aleksander Kwasniewski responded: "Does that mean  you have nothing against this coalition's presence in MON, the  MSZ, and the MSW?"    "You are taking shortcuts," Walesa defended himself. But, in  the end, he gave in and agreed to coalition deputy ministers  being in MON and the MSW, but "using the MSZ as a model." That  means that political deputy ministers from the SLD and the PSL  will join MON and the MSW, but they will not administer the  ministries.    The SLD did not manage to get anything done regarding  Rosati.  Walesa reminded them again that Professor Dariusz Rosati, who  is being promoted by the SLD for finance minister and deputy  minister for economic affairs and who was rejected by the  president, used to be on the governing board of the Foreign Debt  Service Fund. "Do you want people to go around and say that he  got the post to cover up the affair?" the president yelled.    Marek Borowski, deputy chairman of the SLD club, asked the  president bluntly: "Rosati is an honest man. Will you sign his  nomination?" "I am not pressuring you [the SLD], so don't  pressure me, either. If we are to return to anything, it should  be you [Borowski]," Walesa replied. He also admitted that "even  though I had quite a few disputes with Borowski, as far as his  expertise is concerned, there are no reservations."    While talking with GAZETA WYBORCZA, Kwasniewski did not rule  out that, in this situation, the SLD might give up Rosati, but,  until talks with the PSL, Rosati continues to be the coalition's  candidate. "Of course, I would like Borowski to be finance  minister, but you just don't enter the same river twice,"  Kwasniewski explained. Another SLD politician said it is not  very likely because Pawlak does not get along with Borowski.    We asked Borowski whether he would like to be finance  minister again. "There are at least six reasons for which I  would not agree. For now, it is enough to list one of them--no  offer has been made to me," Borowski replied.</p>

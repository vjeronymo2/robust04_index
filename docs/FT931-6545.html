			<p>930301 FT  01 MAR 93 / Letter: A voting system that leads to capricious election results Sir, Edward Mortimer's defence of the single transferable vote (Foreign Affairs, February 24) was ironically given the headline 'Vote to break the bosses'. Ironically because, in fact, one of the effects of the STV is actually to strengthen political 'bosses'. STV encourages the development of a client system in which individual politicians nurture their electorate, often in direct competition with politicians in their own party and often in ways which more closely represent 'pork-barrel' politics than we would believe could be acceptable. STV is also extremely complex. As the Irish general election showed, it can often take weeks for the final result to be known. Further, as the Plant Report showed, STV is 'capricious' with the elimination process, throwing up results which are clearly not the ones intended by the electorate. STV therefore does not have a clear link between voters' intentions and final outcome - which ought to be the prerequisite of any electoral system. In short, STV is neither proportional, nor simple, nor conducive to party discipline or to effective constituency representation. It is difficult, in fact, to find a good reason even to consider it.

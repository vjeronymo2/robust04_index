			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The ninth extraordinary summit of the Economic and  Monetary Union of West Africa [UEMOA] took off this morning in  our capital. A little before 1000, President Nicephore Soglo of  Benin, Mahamane Ousmane of Niger, Abdou Diouf of Senegal, Alpha  Oumar Konare of Mali met on the ninth floor of the Central Bank  of West African States building around the current chairman of  the Union, Burkinabe President Blaise Compaore. Cote d'Ivoire  is represented at the summit by Prime Minister Daniel Kablan  Duncan, and Togo is represented by Economic and Finance Minister  Doh Franck Fianyo.    Since mid-morning, the heads of state of the UEMOA are  discussing the new body which will be charged with channeling  the aspirations for integrated development of the seven member  countries. Two months after the CFA franc devaluation, it is  necessary to merge the experiences of all the states and to  establish some general code of conduct. The tension strongly  expressed by various parties must be interpreted as the natural  expression of the general disarray which followed the Dakar  measure.    According to Nicephore Soglo, in a memorandum making the  rounds in the corridors of the conference, to cope with this  measure each state must be ready to give the full measure of its  national intellect, its work, its courage, its self-denial, and  its high sense of sacrifice.    The combination of efforts at the national level goes  hand-in-hand with the contribution of development partners.  This explains the presence of French Cooperation Minister  Michel Roussin, the representatives of the World Bank, and the  IMF. The issues relating to backup measures will be reviewed.  UEMOA states will ask their Western partners to accelerate the  release of funds under the structural adjustment facility. From  Paris, in particular, the UEMOA states would like to know to  what extent the promised annulation of the debt will be  effective. Today, it is difficult to prejudge the results of  the Ouagadougou meeting but a collective option will be  affirmed: the need to work individually and collectively to  reinforce the economic fabric. This is how the interministerial  council sees the light at end of the tunnel for the member  states. Soumaila Cisse, the Malian minister of finance and  economy, spoke about the devaluation.    [Begin Cisse recording] Our heads of state have signed in an  absolutely responsible manner and the finance ministers must  assume responsibility for the devaluation and take the  corrective measures required. We have a duty to communicate and  explain to our workers and all the social strata of the  population so that things turn out well. This is what I refer  to as assuming responsibility. Assuming responsiblity means  having all the people behind the leaders of the African states  in order to take up the challenge that has been given to us. At  the time when other zones are meeting -- the European Community,  the North American Free Trade Area, bringing together the United  States, Canada and Mexico -- we must unite and reinforce our  cohesion, or else there will be no future. This is what I mean  by assuming responsibility for our situation. [end recording]</p>

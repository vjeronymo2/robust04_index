Ex-pressman Choe Ung-mo in Chongno District of Seoul said  that the New Year address of the respected president gives a new  hope and confidence to the South Korean people who are looking  up to the North under the people-centred politics as a beacon of  hope. He further said:    "His New Year address is a declaration expounding the  historical truth that anthropocentric socialism is sure to win.    "This is a heavy blow to the imperialists and the group of  traitors who are frantically trying to stifle socialism in the  North, clamouring about `end' of socialism."    Kwak Chong-to, a worker residing in Mapo District of Seoul,  said:    "Every sentence of the New Year address, especially the  respected president's manifestation of a resolute position that  pressure or threat will have no effect on the DPRK and the  United States must see all the facts squarely and behave with  circumspection makes us once again feel more keenly how strong  the political and military power of the North is in the  international arena."    Dissident Yi Sang-ho in Kwangju said:    "The respected president, considerate of the ardent desire  of  the fellow countrymen for reunification, reclarified in his New  Year address that the country should be reunified by means of  confederacy. The proposal for reunification through  confederation is the most fair and realistic supreme proposal."    Min Chong-nan, a housewife in Pusan had this to say:    "Upon hearing that respected President Kim Il-song in his  New  Year address said the reunified country must be handed down to  the generations to come, I could not go to sleep all the night  through. Though I was a weak woman, I will devote everything to  the sacred cause of anti-U.S. national salvation and  reunification."</p>

			<p><P> April 23, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> MARINERS HOLD OFF ATHLETICS, 5-2  </P> <P> The Seattle Mariners came out of spring training believing they were a better  team than the one that finished sixth in the American League West last season.  </P> <P> They didn't expect to challenge the Oakland Athletics, but they did expect to  improve on 73-89.  </P> <P> After opening with a victory over the Angels, they lost eight of nine games.  </P> <P> But on Sunday, Jeffrey Leonard and Ken Griffey Jr. each drove in two runs and  Erik Hanson gave up six hits and struck out seven in 6 2/3 innings as the  Mariners beat the A's, 5-2. The victory gave Seattle a split of the four-game  series.  </P> <P> Griffey, batting .373, went five for eight with a homer and six RBIs the past  two games against Oakland.  </P> <P> "I just wanted to go out and forget about last year," said Griffey, who was  three for 20 against Oakland last season and two for 15 against the Angels.  </P> <P> Seattle's victory came against an Oakland lineup filled with reserves. Regulars  Rickey Henderson, Mark McGwire and Dave Henderson all got the day off.  </P> <P> "They didn't have their starting nine out there," Hanson said, "but everybody  here's a big leaguer, so it doesn't matter who they send up. They're all in the  big leagues."  </P> <P> Oakland Manager Tony La Russa, whose club was nearly no-hit two nights ago by  Brian Holman, left the series impressed by the Mariners.  </P> <P> "They're going to be tough; they've got a good thing going," La Russa said.  "Hanson's got a good fastball. He was able to get strikeouts. He's got a good  changeup, but he didn't have to use it much."  </P> <P> Texas 10, New York 4 -- The final score doesn't show it, but former Dodger Tim  Leary turned in another solid performance for the Yankees.  </P> <P> Leary's own error with two out in the first inning at Arlington, Tex., allowed  Harold Baines to come to the plate and the designated hitter socked a three-run  home run.  </P> <P> Leary, who struck out eight, allowed only one other hit until he was removed  after Gary Pettis singled with two out in the seventh and Texas leading, 3-2.  </P> <P> The Rangers scored two in the seventh and Mike Stanley hit a three-run homer in  the eighth to make it a rout. Rafael Palmeiro also homered in the eighth, both  of the home runs coming off bullpen ace Dave Righetti.  </P> <P> The Yankees, after winning four of five, have lost five in a row.  </P> <P> Although he gave up 11 hits in 7 1/3 innings, Kevin Brown joined teammate Nolan  Ryan with a 3-0 record.  </P> <P> Cleveland 5, Chicago 2 -- Cory Snyder hit a two-run home run in the fifth  inning at Cleveland, but that was not the big news.  </P> <P> Indian shortstop Felix Fermin, in his 655th at-bat, finally hit his first home  run. It came off relief pitcher Donn Pall for the final run in the seventh  inning.  </P> <P> Bud Black gave up five hits, but just one earned run before needing help in the  ninth inning.  </P> <P> Kansas City 7, Toronto 1 -- Most pitchers don't enjoy facing the talent-laden  Blue Jays, but Kansas City right-hander Tom Gordon is making a habit of beating  them.  </P> <P> With Bo Jackson hitting his first home run, a two-run smash in the first  inning, Gordon improved his record to 4-0 against the Blue Jays. He gave up  five hits and struck out nine in seven innings.  </P> <P> "Maybe I just concentrate more when I face these guys," Gordon said. "They've  got such a strong lineup. If there's one guy on their team who gives me  trouble, it would be George Bell."  </P> <P> Bell hit his fourth home run for the Toronto run in the sixth. He has hit 17  home runs against the Royals.  </P> <P> Baltimore 3, Detroit 2 -- Detroit pitchers issued 12 walks in this 12-inning  game at Baltimore.  </P> <P> The last, by bullpen ace Mike Henneman, came with the bases loaded and nobody  out to force in the winning run.  </P> <P> Craig Worthington's double, an intentional walk and a bunt single loaded the  bases against Henneman.  </P> <P> Boston 4, Milwaukee 2 -- The Brewers' club-record string of 31 consecutive  scoreless innings ended in the third inning at Milwaukee and they lost in the  11th on a two-out, two-run single by Jody Reed.  </P> <P> Ellis Burks singled in the run in the third that ended the Red Sox scoreless  string at 22 innings.  </P> <P> Lee Smith pitched three scoreless innings to get the victory for the Red Sox,  who tied it in the eighth on Dwight Evans' second home run of the season.

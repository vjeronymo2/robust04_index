			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / UK Company News: StanLife grows unit trust side Standard Life Fund Management, the unit trust company, starts business today following the decision by Standard Life, the UK's largest mutual life insurer, to buy out Halifax Building Society, its former partner in the business. Halifax Standard Trust Management looked after two trusts, Income Advantage and Global Advantage, with 68,000 customers and funds of more than Pounds 300m. The new company will also offer a UK equity growth trust, which was marketed through Standard's other unit trust company. Developing the new wholly owned company could lead to a more fundamental re-structuring of Standard's unit trust subsidiaries.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Vesti" newscast] </F>   [Text] The media and the authorities should have one  another's best interests at heart, if both of them are Russian.  But the journalist proposes, while someone else disposes.    [Milyanchikov] It looks as though Russia's leaders remember  Russian Television only on days that are critical either to the  country or to themselves personally. At such times, a live  relay from a rally can be organized, a necessary program can be  broadcast, and people can even work nights.    But, during the rest of the time, the Russian TV and Radio  Company -- set up, I remind you, at the instigation of Boris  Yeltsin for the fight against Gorbachev -- turns out to be  superfluous.    Today, at any rate, at a meeting of the company's leaders at  the Finance Ministry, it became clear that Russian TV is only  hindering the government. It asks for money. But there is no  money for it. The state company, which is totally dependent on  the state, will only be given half of the money needed, and most  of that will go on paying the communications engineers.    This means that the amount of broadcasting will have to be  almost halved. Many programs will disappear -- "K2", "Program  A", "The Best NBA Games", the Disney cartoons, "Santa Barbara",  and the Monday thrillers. The company no longer has any money  with which to buy them. Thousands of people who trusted Boris  Yeltsin in 1990 and who left the then rich Ostankino for the  disordered life of Russian TV will be dismissed.    Today, in the office of General Director Anatoliy Lysenko,  arguments have already been heard about what is to be cut and by  how much. [video shows meeting in progress, unidentified man  speaking].    [Unidentified speaker] I see this simply as the death of the  channel. Well, we are now trying to find something, but, in  general, the president's decree talked about reduction -- and it  has to be viewed as a kind of therapy, the shedding of a small  amount of broadcasting -- but today we can already see that it  is not therapy. It is surgery. It is amputation. It is the  amputation of state television.    [Milyanchikov] A similar fate awaits Radio Rossii.</p>

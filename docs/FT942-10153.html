			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / Employers call for industrial strategy Britain lacks a long-term agenda to develop technology and industry, and the Treasury is taking too complacent a view of recovery, the Engineering Employers Federation said yesterday. A federation report, published before the government's white paper on competitiveness which is due on Monday, says the trade deficit and the consumption/investment imbalance will not be solved merely by recovery. Mr Graham MacKenzie, federation director-general, said: 'There is an urgent need for strategic decisions.' Manufacturing is receiving good support from the government, the report says, but it is critical of the lack of strategy for energy and transport infrastructures. Action for Growth and Competitiveness. EEF, Broadway House, Tothill Street, London SW1. Pounds 10 to non-members.</p>

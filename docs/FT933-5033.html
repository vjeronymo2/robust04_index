			<p>930906 FT  06 SEP 93 / Survey of Reinsurance (1): Reaping the whirlwinds - New capital is flowing into the reinsurance industry, writes Richard Lapper. But as the markets absorb the cost of a series of recent largescale disasters, they are under continued pressure to raise premiums and to limit the scope of cover AS REINSURERS MEET in Monte Carlo today for their annual rendezvous, investors are showing an almost feverish interest in their industry. Yet in spite of the flow of new capital into the catastrophe market in Bermuda and to a lesser extent in London, international markets are still short of capacity, following the increase in both the number and scale of catastrophe losses in recent years. Bermuda has been the biggest beneficiary of the surge in investor interest, with more than half a dozen new companies, specialising in catastrophe reinsurance, choosing to base themselves on the island in recent months. The biggest new venture is a company, called Partner Reinsurance, launched a week ago by Swiss Re, the world's second biggest reinsurer, John Head, the US investor, and other institutional investors. The three original shareholders have invested Dollars 255m and intend to raise a further Dollars 500m from US, European and Japanese equity markets. Mr Walter Kielholz, a director of Swiss Re, said the aim of the project was to 'generate as much new capacity as possible'. Earlier this summer investors - ranging from insurers and reinsurers such as American International Group, General Re and USF &amp; G, brokers such as Johnson &amp; Higgins and financial houses such as Goldman Sachs - announced backing for four separate ventures with a combined capital of more than Dollars 1bn. The biggest of these - Tempest Reinsurance - is expected to have up to Dollars 500m in capital, while International Property Catastrophe Reinsurance Co, backed by AIG and others, is capitalised at Dollars 300m. In another move Mid-Ocean, a venture started by Marsh McLennan and JP Morgan last year with capital of Dollars 350m, raised a further Dollars 250m through an initial public offering in New York. Separately it emerged in August that both SCOR, the French reinsurer, and Centre Re, now controlled by Switzerland's Zurich Insurance, are both considering new Bermuda-based catastrophe reinsurance subsidiaries. In London, two US insurance companies have announced plans to launch new subsidiaries, dedicated to the catastrophe reinsurance market, while Benfield Group, a fast growing reinsurance broker, is expected to launch a new reinsurance company in the autumn with about Pounds 50m in capital, while Australian investors are preparing to inject ADollars 300m into a new Sydney-based facility. This influx of capital will ease capacity shortages but it is unlikely to be sufficient to depress rates, which have risen strongly since 1989 following a series of multi-billion pound insurance losses. The impact of hurricane Andrew last year, which left losses of more than Dollars 15.5bn and was the biggest ever US catastrophe loss, underlined the increasing scale of catastrophes in recent years. Mr Alan Badanes, who specialises in insurance mergers and acquisitions with Chase Manhattan, says that even after the most recent announcements in Bermuda, the amount of new money is still dwarfed by the volume of capital which has left the industry in recent years. 'Any way you look at it there is a big hole to fill. In terms of raw supply and demand this means prices should hold up for the next few years,' says Mr Badanes. In London, underwriters and brokers expect the extra capacity will allow them to stabilise covers and rates at present levels. They stress that at least as far as the 1994 renewal season is concerned most Bermudian underwriters are following the rates set by underwriters in London. Mr Richard Keeling, underwriter with Murray Lawrence syndicate 362, and a leader of reinsurance business in London, says that some buyers of catastrophe covers, from Australia, for example, could even face rate increases. But he hopes that increases will be avoided elsewhere. 'With a bit of luck we can stabilise the catastrophe product.' Mr Keeling is expecting the most substantial rate increases in the market for risk excess covers, which cover the peak exposures of a ceding company. Rates in the risk excess market vary by as much as 500 per cent. 'The market has got to a point where it needs to be repricing the product.' The 'hardening' is likely to be as pronounced in the proportional market - where reinsurers assume a set percentage of exposures in return for the same percentage of original premium less a ceding commission. Europe's biggest reinsurers are still not satisfied that rates have been increased to adequate levels. Last year the withdrawal of Munich Re and some of its European rivals from some markets increased capacity shortages and spurred further rate increases. Munich Re excluded some catastrophe risks from policies in the hurricane-prone Caribbean, for example, and refused to cover terrorism in policies sold to UK insurers, following the IRA bomb attacks of April 1992. This latter move caused confusion in the UK industry and, in spite of the establishment of a new government-backed reinsurer, Pool Re, many of the country's businesses are now not protected from terrorist incidents. Dr Fedor Nierhaus, a management board member at Munich Re, says that original rates for earthquakes and storms are still too low in almost all markets and that commercial lines business is still heavily underpriced, hinting that further tightening could be on the way. 'We have taken the view that we can't follow these inadequate original rates any longer. We can only agree a separate reinsurance price. If we cannot get an adequate price we must reduce coverage,' he says. Reinsurers are likely to press for the introduction of loss participation clauses and lower commissions on proportional business. Reinsurers could also insist on new restrictions to the wordings of proportional treaties, including caps on catastrophe exposures. Caps have been introduced in most American proportional treaties over the last 12 months, according to Standard &amp; Poor's, the US rating agency. Dr Nierhaus says Munich Re intends to press for similar changes elsewhere and says that reinsurers will be unable to give 'unlimited cover for each loss event'. The company will 'pursue this limitation. It is a matter of fundamental importance,' he adds. Underwriters in London now expect other European reinsurers to follow suit, a development which could leave some European insurers with problems. 'This is very serious especially for French and German insurers who have no idea about the size of their exposures,' said a Lloyd's underwriter. These companies will come under more more pressure from their reinsurers to provide more detailed information to their reinsurers detailing their exposures to storm and other catastrophe risks. One other implication is that hard pressed and financially weak direct insurers may be unable to use proportional treaties to bolster their capital. The proportional market could also see some other changes with European underwriters of liability and motor business refusing to offer unlimited cover except where it is a legal requirement to do so. A leading London broker says that reinsurers successfully pushed through these changes during the Australian renewal season at the beginning of July, although they were less successful in the South African market. Overall, though, current developments seem likely to reinforce the recent trend in the market for reinsurers to carry a greater proportion of exposure on thir own books, rather than syndicating them widely with dozens of reinsurers sharing a small part of each contract. 'The flight to capital and the flight to quality will continue,' says Mr Badanes. 'Rather than 70 different reinsurers all taking small lines on one reinsurance contract, there will be fewer but larger companies and larger lines.' Mr Michael Palm, executive vice-president of Centre Re, believes 'a smaller market made up of larger players' is emerging. 'Pricing and terms will be controlled by the large and well capitalised companies,' he adds.</p>

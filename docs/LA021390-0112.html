			<p><P> February 13, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOOD MANNERS IN THE '90S;  </P> <P> WHAT'S A POLITE PERSON TO DO IN THE AGE OF FAX AND AIDS?  </P> <P> Dear Amy:  </P> <P> Help!  </P> <P> On second thought, make that: Help, please!  </P> <P> Ms. Vanderbilt, you must be turning over in your grave because of the problems  that polite society is suffering as we enter the '90s.  </P> <P> I mean, as manners go, I'm not exactly a model of decorum. (I take special  pleasure in cutting off Camaros on the freeway). But even I know there should  be a better way of congratulating your second husband on the birth of his first  child from his third marriage than just looking embarrassed and saying, "Gee,  you told me you'd had a vasectomy!"  </P> <P> Or writing to all your friends in one fell swoop by using the recall button on  the personal computer. Or telling a potential sexual partner to use a condom by  strategically leaving a dozen boxes of Trojans next to the Champagne in the  refrigerator. Or wrestling with the complexities of call-waiting by shouting  "Hang on!" or murmuring "Sorry, this new caller is richer than you, Mr.  Murdock."  </P> <P> Just consider, for instance, the contretemps I found myself in just trying to  write this story. I was chatting on the phone to New York etiquette arbiter  Charlotte Ford when suddenly I heard a "beep" and Miss Manners (a.k.a. Judith  Martin) was holding on call waiting from Washington.  </P> <P> "Uh, what do I do, Charlotte?" I asked in a panic.  </P> <P> "It's easy," she replied, soothingly. "I think that whoever's on the phone  first when call-waiting comes in takes precedence. Tell the other person you'll  call them back."  </P> <P> Hmmm, logical enough. So I clicked back to Martin.  </P> <P> "Judith? I've got Charlotte Ford on the other line, and she says I should stay  on the phone with her and call you back. Does that sound OK?"  </P> <P> Miss Manners paused a moment to consider.  </P> <P> "Absolutely," Martin purred.  </P> <P> What I need, Amy, is a definitive guide to all this stuff. Something to keep  right by the bedside to govern matters of a sexual, or nonsexual, nature. It's  no good to find out the proper way to act after the fact. By then my social  life is going to degenerate into watching reruns of "Facts of Life."  </P> <P> But wait, what are these packages on my desk? Could it be that America's  foremost etiquette experts have been working overtime to establish polite  parameters for the '90s?  </P> <P> Some of these books are from the usual suspects: Judith Martin, Letitia  Baldridge, and Charlotte Ford. But, suddenly there are new names making waves  in the manners business. After all, who better than Sidney Biddle Barrows of  Mayflower Madam fame to solve such bedroom dilemmas as: Do you make eye contact  at an orgy? (No.) Do you use your lover's toothbrush? (Yes.)  </P> <P> "My literary agent thought up the idea," Barrows confides. "Most people think  sex is inherently not very polite, and certainly not something one talks about  unless one absolutely has to. But etiquette is a way of romancing between men  and women. And now that we're not jumping into bed with someone, we need  something like this to drag out the courtship a little longer."  </P> <P> All the authors attempt to create a new code of etiquette for a new time. Let's  see, Amy, how do I explain it? Men are sometimes women. A child can have four  different mothers. Answering machines talk to one another.  </P> <P> As social arbiter Letitia Baldridge notes, "Manners comprise everything in our  human relationships, all the things that we do all day long and the way we  interrelate with people. And if any of these things change, then we want to  change with them."  </P> <P> That's why Baldridge, the former chief of staff during Jackie Kennedy's stint  as First Lady, has written her "Complete Guide to the New Manners for the  '90s." (Remember her, Amy? In 1978, four years after your death, she updated  your etiquette book. Then Tish decided she was a big enough name to go it  alone.)  </P> <P> Baldridge, who cheerfully dispenses advice on what a pregnant bride should wear  and whether it's polite to send a dinner invitation through the fax machine, is  convinced that manners are making a comeback in the '90s. "You bet. I see it in  my mail, I see it in the people I lecture."  </P> <P> But why? "We became very self-obsessed in the '80s when the philosophy was  'succeed, make money and spend it.' And I think it's time to stand back and  start spending as much energy thinking about other people."  </P> <P> I thought, at 646 pages, Baldridge's book would be le dernier cri. Yet, it's  beaten hands down in sheer heft and chutzpah by fellow Washingtonian Judith  Martin's latest opus, released in November and entitled grandly enough, "Miss  Manners' Guide for the Turn-of-the-Millennium." The syndicated columnist takes  742 pages to impart her wit and wisdom on contemporary quandaries from the  decline of the nuclear family to the rise in women in the workplace.  </P> <P> Are things really that bad to warrant so much space? "Certainly," Martin  sniffs. "We have such a long way to go to get to some place approaching  civilization."  </P> <P> It's her view that American society is coming to the end of a generation-long  experiment that started in the '60s when the baby-boomers decided just to chuck  existing rules of behavior and be themselves.  </P> <P> "This is what I call the Jean Jacques Rousseau School of Etiquette," Miss  Manners relates. "The problem being that in our natural state we're not all  that livable."  </P> <P> In addition, Martin sees our current social situation complicated by two main  factors: technology -- the fax machine and answering machines weren't  ubiquitous a decade ago -- and sex. Not only are sexually transmitted diseases  a topic that must be addressed these days, but so is sexual etiquette in the  workplace.  </P> <P> "The very simple rule that takes care of most of these problems -- that gender  is simply not relevant in the workplace -- is a very difficult concept to get  across. Because once you realize that, then the questions of who goes through  the door first and who pays for lunch are very easily settled by rank and  position."  </P> <P> OK, OK, already. I'm beginning to feel like I've spent the last month locked in  a finishing school. Luckily, that King of the Quip, P. J. O'Rourke, has come to  my rescue with his "Modern Manners: An Etiquette Book for Rude People,"  published in paperback this spring.  </P> <P> Written with enough churlishness to make "The War of the Roses" look like a  lovefest, this guide contains such ungentlemanly advice as how to falsify a  family tree and how to commit polite crime. And among the many '90s questions  answered is my personal favorite: how many pierced earrings to wear?  </P> <P> "Start with the number two and add one earring for each of the following  phrases that accurately describes your life: bulimia, drug dependency, sexual  promiscuity, from Queens, boyfriend in a band," O'Rourke writes. "Now, subtract  one earring for each of the following phrases that you answer yes to: I just  took my LSATs, my parents are on their way for a visit, I have a church wedding  coming up."  </P> <P> Still, Amy, this book's overall effect is to make me want to slug its author.  Maybe that's one reason why O'Rourke didn't bother responding to the plaintive  message I left on his Washington answering machine.  </P> <P> Compare that to the Mayflower Madam's behavior. She was only too willing to be  interviewed about this month's "Mayflower Manners," which describes itself as  an "Etiquette for Consenting Adults." Of course, Barrows is the very picture of  politeness as she delves into such uncharted territory as: Is it rude to rip an  exotic garment off a woman? (It depends on how much the thing costs.) Or when  two people meet through personal ads, who is the host? (Whoever placed the ad.)  Or even whether there are basic principles of etiquette that apply to the  menage a trois. (No one should show favoritism.)  </P> <P> Barrows, of course, believes she's providing a valuable public service. "I  don't think you'll find anywhere in the other books the proper etiquette for  treating a call girl or escort service. And I don't think you'll see too many  pages on how to behave at an S &amp; M party in a club or a private home.  </P> <P> "A lot of people think, 'Ugh, an etiquette book' and think of Letitia Baldridge  and all that dry, ponderous stuff," says Barrows, defending her lighter touch.  "That's what makes my book fun."  </P> <P> But it wasn't fun at all when a seemingly simple question about AIDS drew  Barrows into a national controversy recently and one gay activist group in New  York City claimed the Mayflower Madam had made a major faux pas.  </P> <P> The question was: "If a host invites a known carrier of AIDS to a dinner party,  should he so inform his other guests?"  </P> <P> Barrows responded: "Yes. Most people will know that they cannot contract the  disease by being seated at a dinner table with a carrier. But it is a courtesy  to all to let them know ahead of time."  </P> <P> As a result, Barrows was "disinvited" to the premiere of a movie, while her  publisher, Doubleday, was asked to issue an apology.  </P> <P> Using language not printable in a family newspaper, Barrows fumed that she had  been the victim of a setup by "a very radical gay group that's always looking  for media attention. How could I be disinvited to something when I was never  invited in the first place? This whole thing is so personally upsetting to me I  can't tell you. It's a real nightmare."  </P> <P> As for what to do in the situation, Barrows still sticks by her advice. "I have  a huge number of gay friends and every time I've ever been invited anywhere I  was always told if there was somebody with AIDS who was going to be there. Not  because these people were trying to warn me. But because they wanted other  guests to have an extra level of sensitivity."  </P> <P> On the other hand, both Baldridge and Martin didn't see the necessity for  telling anyone anything. "At most respectable dinner parties," notes Miss  Manners, "there wouldn't be any activity where you would catch AIDS so I don't  see why you should have to tell people."  </P> <P> But etiquette arbiter Charlotte Ford professed some confusion as to what to do.  "Hmmm. Such a tough situation," she murmured. "I think there are certain people  who don't care, and there are other people who would be just devastated if they  were at a party with someone who had AIDS."  </P> <P> Her solution, she decided, was simply not to invite the person with AIDS to  dinner -- which AIDS support groups say is also wrong.  </P> <P> So who's right, Amy? I honestly don't know. The only thing I'm certain of is  that by next week, next month, next year, another social phenomenon will create  another conundrum for etiquette experts.  </P> <P> And, Amy, you won't be here to help us through it.  </P> <P> </P> <P> What's the office etiquette when men and women work together?  </P> <P>  JUDITH MARTIN: The very simple rule that takes care of most problems is that  gender is simply not relevant in the workplace. Once you realize that, then the  questions of who goes through the door first and who pays for lunch are very  easily settled. It should be settled just as if it were an all-male workplace  -- by rank and position.  </P> <P> CHARLOTTE FORD: If I was a woman and invited to dinner by a male colleague, I  would certainly say, "Let's have lunch first." I just wouldn't be available for  dinner.  </P> <P> P.J. O'ROURKE: Anyone who has good manners on the job probably won't have that  job long. Courtesy does not belong in the workplace.  </P> <P>  How do you ask a man to wear a condom?  </P> <P>  LETITIA BALDRIDGE: You can say to him, "I'm very sorry, but if you don't use a  condom, there's just no way we can be together." You can then give him some, or  tell him where the nearest drugstore is, or tell him, "Let's have dinner  another night," and send him away.  </P> <P> MARTIN: If you know the person well enough to make that necessary, you ought to  be able to say anything. What amuses me is when people shift into prudery. If  you are on intimate terms with somebody, surely you can ask them intimate  questions.  </P> <P> FORD: I'd be a little bit embarrassed and a little bit shy and say, "Listen, I  hope you've taken some sort of protection because I don't want to contract any  diseases, and I'm sure you don't either."  </P> <P> SYDNEY BIDDLE BARROWS: It is not seemly, nor necessary, to smile on the first  date and say, "Love your dress. By the way, will you be giving me a fatal  disease?" Instead, allow time to pass -- that's what these dates are for, after  all. By the time sex seems a possibility, you will have necessarily both  crossed that line beyond which these sensitive issues may be discussed.  </P> <P>  If you're giving a dinner party and invite someone who has AIDS, should you  tell your other guests?  </P> <P>  BALDRIDGE: I don't think you tell anybody that the person has AIDS. Because  frankly the guests are not catching AIDS from that person. It really isn't  relevant.  </P> <P> MARTIN: It depends on the activity of the dinner party. At most respectable  dinner parties, there wouldn't be any activity where you would catch AIDS, so I  don't see why should have to tell people. Would you tell your guests that one  of them had cancer? But if you were giving an orgy, I think you should tell  people.  </P> <P> FORD: I don't know that I would invite somebody to dinner knowing they have  AIDS, simply because I think it would make everybody very uncomfortable. But I  think it all depends on the situation. If you are going to do that, I think you  have to be very careful how you do it and whom you invite.  </P> <P> BARROWS: Yes. Most people will know that they cannot contract the disease by  being seated at a dinner table with a carrier. But it is a courtesy to all to  let them know ahead of time.  </P> <P>  What is the proper way to use your answering machine?  </P> <P>  BALDRIDGE: The best way is to record as short a message as possible, 15  seconds, and be very business-like and be very up.  </P> <P> MARTIN: The telephone is a very rude instrument. Monitoring calls on the  answering machine is polite. People somehow put the onus of politeness  mistakenly against people who do not accept all calls at any time. There is  nothing wrong with picking and choosing.  </P> <P> O'ROURKE: With judicious use of answering machines, a love affair can be  conducted without the bother of ever talking to the loved one.  </P> <P>  Is it polite for a mother to breast-feed her baby in public?  </P> <P>  BALDRIDGE: Definitely not. Anyone looking over, especially any man,  immediately starts to conjecture about the size and shape of the breast.  </P> <P> MARTIN: No. In some countries people breast-feed on the street, but it is not  done properly in the United States, and the argument that it is a natural thing  bears no weight with me.  </P> <P> FORD: I've always said that whatever a mother wants to do is her business. The  only thing is, I think you should do it in private. Go to an airport area not  populated by people, go into another room in someone's house.  </P> <P>  If a child has several sets of parents because of divorces, how do you decide  who should come to school on parents' day?  </P> <P>  BALDRIDGE: It's up to the child to decide whom he or she wants. The child  should ask that parent to come and then apologize to the others and explain why  they weren't asked.  </P> <P> FORD: It all depends on the relationship between the adults. Forget the  children. It's the adults that set the mood for whatever the function's going  to be. It's very, very hard, but somebody's got to bite the bullet.  </P> <P> MARTIN: That is incredibly complicated. I'd say parents, their mates and  assorted other people who want to be involved. I was president of a school  board where we didn't realize for a long time that it was offensive to send out  questionnaires where it gave only one line for "mother's name" and "father's  name." So we would put four lines under each for families to do what they  liked. So those things have had to be adjusted.  </P> <P>  What is the worst new breach of entertaining etiquette?  </P> <P>  BALDRIDGE: Some people feel that they should turn on their TV sets even at  dinner parties. I've seen guests leave the table to go and watch their favorite  football game in the library.  </P> <P> MARTIN: The understood social contract whereby the host sets the terms of the  contract and the guests can take it or leave it has broken down miserably.  People now consider an invitation to be the opening of negotiations. You tell  me what you're serving for dinner, and then I tell you this is going to kill  me, or you tell me who the other guests are and then I decide if I want to  accept. And heaven forbid if you try to set a dress code.  </P> <P> FORD: Hosts who ask guests to take their shoes off. You have to respect your  host's wishes. But as somebody said, if their carpets are that good, why do  they ever have any guests?  </P></p>

			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Cocoa pact settlement remains out of reach TWO WEEKS of talks between cocoa producing and consuming countries on a new price-stabilising international agreement are set to end inconclusively today. The 45 countries taking part in the United Nations-sponsored talks will return to Geneva in February for a fourth and final attempt to conclude an accord to replace the 1986 pact, which expires in September 1993. The past fortnight has seen a significant narrowing of the gap between producers and consumers on the maximum amount of cocoa that could be withdrawn from the market to help defend whatever price range is set by the agreement. Consumers have now proposed 330,000 tonnes, up from 300,000 tonnes when the meeting began. Producers have asked for 380,000 tonnes, down from 600,000. But, despite some movement on both sides, the gulf between producer and consumer price proposals remains dauntingly wide. And there has been virtually no progress on the thorny issue of financing the new accord. On Monday, producers proposed a price band of SDR1,180-1,770 a tonne with a median price of SDR1,475, down from a median price of SDR1,820 at the start of the meeting. Consumers raised their price offer by just SDR50 last week to a median price of SDR1,050 in a price band of SDR840-1,260 a tonne. Conference delegates said yesterday that consumers had some modest flexibility to raise their price offer but this went nowhere near to satisfying producer demands. The offer already surpasses the current market price for cocoa, equivalent to about SDR815 a tonne. On financing, producers want equal contributions from the two sides via a levy system. However, the European Community, at the insistence of Britain, the Netherlands and Germany, continues to press for funds to come from existing assets in the first instance. These assets comprise mainly arrears of contributions to the present agreement by producers, notably the two biggest, Ivory Coast and Brazil, and the 240,000 tonnes of cocoa held in the buffer stock. The EC, which accounts for 40 per cent of world consumption, is the most important consumer at the Geneva talks, in the absence of the US.</p>

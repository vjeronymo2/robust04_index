			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / Babangida names Nigerian cabinet NIGERIA'S military President Ibrahim Babangida swore in a new cabinet yesterday, leaving unchanged the important portfolios of oil, finance and foreign affairs, Reuter reports from Abuja. General Babangida, who has pledged to hand over political power to elected civilians by the end of this year, trimmed the cabinet's size to 20 from 27 and merged some ministries in a cost-cutting exercise. The retention of Mr Jibril Aminu, current Opec president, as petroleum minister, Mr Abubakar Alhaji, as finance minister and Mr Ike Nwachukwu, as foreign minister, indicated business as usual in Nigeria. Two cabinet newcomers were also sworn in: Mr Clement Akpangbo, head of the Nigerian Bar Association, who becomes justice minister, and Mr Sam Oyovbaire, who heads a merged information and culture ministry.</p>

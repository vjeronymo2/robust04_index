Urban Backstrom sends out conflicting signals. MANADENS AFFARER  has mapped out the network that surrounds and influences the new  chairman of the Bank of Sweden.    The hotel owner's son from Visby has sat down on the Central  Bank throne. Nearly 2 meters tall and wearing a dark suit, he  welcomes everyone as his guest.    He likes business, both theoretical and practical. That  interest has led him to doctoral studies in both economics and  advanced tax planning.    The selection of a Moderate under secretary of state to  succeed Bengt Dennis was controversial, and the SDP [Social  Democratic Party] registered a protest. But on the surface, he  will become everyone's friend, probably including even the SDP  in the long run.    Few people know what he is hiding under that well-pressed  surface. Probably a happy mixture of a kid with a zest for life  and a single-minded climber with sharp claws.    Politics is a belated discovery for Backstrom. It is true  that he was student council chairman at the secondary school in  Granna, but he was not an active member of the Moderate Party.  Nor was he one when Georg Danell recruited him to be a  nonpolitical member of former Moderate Party Chairman Gosta  Bohman's staff.    Despite his stints with the Association of Share Investors,  the Consensus Brokerage Firm, and the Mollberg Hotel in  Helsingborg, it was at the Government Office that the new  chairman of the Bank of Sweden got his training. But there was  integrity there, and he was not regarded as a typical political  commissar.    At Consensus, however, the tone was different.    "Backstrom was a thoroughly political CEO and favored his  old  buddies," says one of those who was fired.  <H5>  Economists </H5>   Urban Backstrom became an interest rate dove as opposed to  the hawk Dennis following an article in EKONOMISK DEBATT. That  earned him praise from, among others, LO [Swedish Federation of  Trade Unions] economist Dan Anderson. Backstrom reportedly  listens quite openly to both Anderson and his colleague P.O.  Edin.    The most natural partner for dialogue in that network is  Lars  Jonung, professor of economics at the Stockholm School of  Economics and economic adviser to Carl Bildt.    Backstrom also listens to Hans T. Soderstrom, associate  professor of economics at the School of Economics and, since  1985, president of the SNS (Industrial Council for Social and  Economic Studies), and Lars Calmfors, a professor of  international economics at Stockholm University who is active at  the Lindbeck Institute. Ingemar Hansson, financial adviser to  Anne Wibble in the Ministry of Finance; Lars Heikensten, senior  economist at the Trade Bank; and Johan Myrman, professor of  economics at the Stockholm School of Economics, are other  heavyweights.    A couple of Bohman's former associates know the new chairman  of the Bank of Sweden well: Jan Herin, senior economist at the  SAF [Swedish Employers Confederation], and Ulf Jacobsson, senior  economist at the Federation of Swedish Industries.    Ebba Lindso is also one of Backstrom's trusted friends. She  was formerly CEO of Transferator but is now in business for  herself and sits on a good many boards of directors. She is also  the KDS [Christian Democratic Party] economic expert.  <H5>  Mentors </H5>   Lars Tobisson is party secretary and the Moderate Party's  gray eminence. Backstrom has a lot to thank him for. Tobisson  trained him and helped him in his career.    During his days in the Riksdag, Backstrom was rapporteur for  Staffan Burenstam-Linder, then chairman of the Moderate Party's  finance and tax committee. Burenstam-Linder, a former minister,  is currently rector of the Stockholm School of Economics and  chairman of the board of governors of the Bank of Sweden. He is  probably another person that the 39-year-old chairman of the  Bank of Sweden will turn to. Backstrom was senior economist for  the Association of Share Investors in 1985 and 1986. In fact, he  ran the operation together with the association's pugnacious  managing director, Lars-Erik Forsgardh. Like Backstrom,  Forsgardh has a background in the hotel business: He was CEO of  the Skogsgard Hotel in Sodertalje from 1979 to 1984. Backstrom  and Forsgardh have a great deal in common and still see each  other.  <H5>  Family </H5>   His father and mother, Sven-Ake and Maj Britt Backstrom,  first operated the main hotel in Visby and then bought the  tradition-rich Mollberg Hotel in Helsingborg.    The Opera Cafe in Stockholm was the model for the Mollberg  in  the Backstrom era. But the style was a little more feudal. Among  other things, it was considered desirable for the maids to  curtsy to the owners. And thrift was the watchword at the  Mollberg. Beer was a mixture: half new tap beer and half old  foam from the bench under the bar.    Both parents thought it was great to have a son who worked  for Gosta Bohman.    When Sven-Ake Backstrom fell ill, his son moved in as  assistant manager from 1983 until 1985, when the hotel was sold.    Urban Backstrom tried to get the personnel to take more  responsibility -- once he was well established. Once, for  example, they ran out of rose wine and a waiter came to ask what  to do. The answer was lightning quick: "Mix red and white."  Fortunately, the boss was not always obeyed.    Backstrom is married to Eva, a stewardess with SAS. They  live  in a detached house in downtown Djursholm. They have two  children -- Catarina, 11, and Filip, 7 -- a housemaid declared  on their income tax return, and a dachshund named Hugo. In the  summer they like to travel or stay in his mother-in-law's  apartment in France.  <H5>  Bank of Sweden </H5>   The network at the Bank of Sweden is an unwritten chapter.  Thomas Franzen, deputy chairman of the bank, was considered a  dark horse. But as soon as Backstrom took over, he urged Franzen  to stay on and accept another term when the old one expires in  May. This despite the fact that Franzen has been largely  responsible for formulating the Bank of Sweden's interest policy  since the late 1980's -- the very period that Backstrom has  criticized.    As these lines are being written (at the end of January),  Backstrom is already looking for a successor to the other deputy  chairman, Claes Norgren, the newly appointed head of the Finance  Inspectorate. The bank's extensive international contacts make  it necessary to have three people at the top.  <H5>  Banking Industry </H5>   The banking crisis gave Backstrom access to everyone in bank  management. And he feels as comfortable with Bjorn Svedberg and  Peter and Jacob Wallenberg at the Scandinavian Private Bank as  he does with Hans Dahlborg and Jacob Palmstierna at the Northern  Bank or Tom Hedelius and especially Arne Martensson from the  Trade Bank. Naturally, the same was true with Gabriel Urwitz and  Per Lundberg of the former Gota Bank.  <H5>  Business World </H5>   Backstrom has close professional contacts with Fredrik  Lundberg, chief stockholder and CEO of Lundberg Enterprises.  They met each other in 1990, when Lundberg's Ostgota Private  Bank bought out Consensus. The deputy CEO at Consensus at the  time was Urban Backstrom, and he quickly became CEO. Fredrik  Lundberg now lives a stone's throw from Backstrom.    Another Lundberg man, Per Welin, deputy CEO of Lundberg  Enterprises, was on the Consensus board of directors when  Backstrom was CEO.    Arne Martensson, CEO of the Trade Bank, and Backstrom met  each other in the fall of 1991. They have close and complicated  contacts. Martensson was once a member of the Moderate Party's  advisory group.    Another person that Backstrom esteems in the business world  is Melker Schorling, the young and recently appointed CEO of  Skanska who was formerly CEO of Securitas.    Sten Westerberg is the member of the Liberal Party who was  under secretary of state under Gosta Bohman (Moderate Party).  Following a banking career, he is now in business for himself.  He is considered talented and creative, and he has lunch with  Backstrom from time to time. In the ministry, Westerberg  succeeded Lars Wohlin, now CEO of the City Mortgage Bank. Wohlin  is a quick-witted man who has known Backstrom since the  mid-1980's.    Olle Wastberg and Backstrom were colleagues in the Ministry  of Finance. Wastberg's current job as editor in chief of  EXPRESSEN makes him a valuable contact.  <H5>  Inner Circle </H5>   A few people outside the family are close to Backstrom.  Minister of Taxation Bo Lundgren is one of the chosen few. He  was also a candidate for the job of chairman of the Bank of  Sweden but lost the struggle. Lundgren has become an  increasingly important person to Backstrom since their days  together in the ministry. Now the two of them meet even away  from their jobs as time permits. They usually relax over a  drink, sometimes at a nightclub after late meetings, and they  play squash and badminton together.    Bo Lundgren's poker face conceals more humor than one might  imagine. Like Backstrom, he was also a member of the board of  directors of the National Debt Office and of Wine and Spirits.    Peter Egardt, Bildt's under secretary of state, is the man  who gave Backstrom the most support during the years in the  Government Office. They are good friends and meet even away from  the job. Egardt is the pivotal figure in the government, a  chain-smoker, and a tireless worker. His role as coordinator of  the four coalition parties is one of today's toughest political  jobs.    Another of Backstrom's guardian angels is Olof Ehrenkrona,  planning chief for the Cabinet Office. But they are not as close  to each other.    Arne Bjorhn was Backstrom's predecessor in the  Moderate-controlled Government Office and once a very good  friend. For a long time Bjorhn, Backstrom, and Egardt met every  month for a so-called interest rate lunch. But after Arne  Bjorhn's and his brother Gunnar's swindle at the Merchant Bank,  the relationship was put on hold. (In April 1993, the Svea Court  of Appeal sentenced Arne Bjorhn to two months in prison for  bribery and tax evasion. His brother Gunnar received a one-year  prison sentence for serious tax evasion and violation of the law  on corporations. The same scandal resulted in a 1.5-year prison  sentence for K.O. Feldt's former deputy assistant under  secretary, Thorvald Pettersson, for tax evasion and bribery.)    Arne Bjorhn once helped both Backstrom and Egardt with  extensive but legal tax planning.  <H5>  Foreigners </H5>   Backstrom is inheriting contacts in central bank circles  from  Bengt Dennis, who was chairman of the board of directors of the  BIS (Bank for International Settlements) in Basel.    Hans Tietmeyer became president of the German Federal Bank  in  October 1993 after serving as, among other things, under  secretary of state in the Ministry of Finance. The same career  was followed by Jean-Claude Trichet, governor of the Bank of  France. In Italy, Antonio Fazio recently rose to become governor  of the Bank of Italy. Fazio was previously a deputy governor, as  was Eddie George, who has now become governor of the  tradition-rich Bank of England.    Alan Greenspan, on the other hand, has been boss of the  Federal Reserve Bank since 1987. Backstrom will have more  dealings with the head of the Federal Reserve in New York, who  acts as the U.S. banking system's "minister of foreign affairs."    In Basel, Backstrom will also meet the new BIS chief, Andrew  Crockett from the Bank of England, and his predecessor Alexandre  Lamfalussy. The latter is the new head of the European Monetary  Institute, which is the embryo of the European Union's future  central bank.    Backstrom will also meet such prominent economists in  Washington as Joseph Steiglitz and Alan Blinder of Bill  Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers.</p>

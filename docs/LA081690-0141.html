			<p><P> August 16, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FLURRY OF SHOOTINGS PUZZLES POLICE;  </P> <P> HOLLYWOOD: AT LEAST 5 GANG MEMBERS HAVE BEEN KILLED IN THE LAST THREE WEEKS.  POLICE SAY FOUR OR FIVE RIVAL FACTIONS APPEAR TO BE INVOLVED.  </P> <P> Police are searching for the reasons behind a flurry of violent clashes that  have erupted between rival gangs in Hollywood, leaving at least five gang  members dead in the last three weeks alone.  </P> <P> So far, police have few suspects, and even fewer answers.  </P> <P> "All of a sudden, Hollywood has erupted on us," said Detective Michael  DePasquale of the Los Angeles Police Department's Westside anti-gang unit,  Community Resources Against Street Hoodlums, or CRASH.  </P> <P> "It is not like there are two gangs at war with each other," DePasquale said.  "It seems like numerous gangs are involved. We have no idea what is going on  here."  </P> <P> Until the latest outburst, armed clashes were relatively uncommon in Hollywood,  he said, but he noted that violence can surge without apparent reason.  </P> <P> What is troubling to CRASH unit members and authorities from LAPD's Hollywood  Division in this instance, they say, is the number of gangs -- at least four or  five -- that appear to be involved.  </P> <P> Police say they have suspects in only one of the slayings and they are trying  to determine if there is a pattern to the violence.  </P> <P> Usually there are pay-backs after each gang slaying, and an already beefed-up  CRASH unit is bracing for the inevitable. "I expect more," DePasquale said.  </P> <P> In the most recent gang clash, one youth was killed, another paralyzed from the  waist down and a third seriously injured during a drive-by shooting at 10:30  p.m. Sunday night.  </P> <P> Francisco Reynosa, 14, of Northeast Los Angeles was walking down the 600 block  of North Harvard Boulevard with some friends when rival gang members drove by  in a car, yelled gang slogans and fired numerous shots at the three youths,  according to homicide Detective Russell Kuster of Hollywood Division. He said  that Reynosa was pronounced dead at the scene and that the conditions of the  other two youths have not changed since Sunday.  </P> <P> Police have no suspects or motives in that case.  </P> <P> On Aug. 6, a 25-year-old suspected gang member was killed in an afternoon  drive-by shooting at Melrose Avenue and Harvard Boulevard. Police said they  have no arrests or suspects.  </P> <P> Two more gang members were killed in separate incidents on Aug. 3. In the  first, two groups of rival gangs were walking down Fountain Avenue near Gower  Street at about 7 a.m. when one suspect shot two gang members, killing one at  the scene and injuring the other. Police said they arrested two suspects  several hours later, one a juvenile and one an adult.  </P> <P> At 9:15 p.m. that night, rival gang members began arguing at a gas station at  Melrose and Wilton Place when one suspect shot two rivals, killing one and  seriously wounding another. Police said they have suspects in that case but  have made no arrests.  </P> <P> On July 20, two groups from rival gangs confronted each other about 5 p.m. at  the corner of Oxford Avenue and Beverly Boulevard. Gang slogans were shouted,  and one group started chasing members of the other on foot while firing at  them. One suspected gang member struck by at least one bullet was pronounced  dead at the scene.  </P></p>

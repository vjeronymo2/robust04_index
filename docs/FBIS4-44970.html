			<p>CSO     [Text] People from both the Northern and Southern Yemeni  communities in Saudi Arabia who are there either to work or are  on a visit have gathered around radios and TV sets in an attempt  to learn about the fighting that is going on in their country  between the two sides.    Although the satellite channels have played a major role in  broadcasting news about the events taking place in Yemen, radios  still remain the basic means by which they get their news and  information. The reason for this is that a great many of the  Yemenis living in Saudi Arabia cannot afford to buy satellite  dishes. However, in some of the Yemeni households where there  are satellite dishes, people have gathered around TV sets to  follow firsthand what is being broadcast by the satellite  channels.    Likewise, some owners of commercial stores have said that  there has been a noticeable increase in the demand for radio  sets.    Both Yemeni residents and visitors are worried because  telephone communications and trips by air have been cut off, and  these constitute the only means by which they can properly  assess what is going on in their country.    An official in the Yemeni Airlines Company said: "Large  numbers of Yemenis are coming to us and asking whether or not  there is a flight going to, or coming from, Yemen. Also, some  passengers are having their names put on the reservation list in  anticipation of flights starting up."    AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT met with some of the Yemeni residents and  conducted interviews with them in order to get their reactions  concerning what their thoughts have been since the war broke out  in Yemen. 'Abd Muhammad Hasan said: "I have been working in  Saudi Arabia for three years. My wife and children visited me  during the last month of Ramadan. Although our area is 400 miles  from Sanaa, the fact that telephone connections have been cut  off and flights and trips by sea have been stopped means that  the situation has deteriorated."    He added: "I thought of going along with my five colleagues  who returned to Yemen via the land route. But my health didn't  allow me to go, and I need to get well. I don't know if my  colleagues, who left Jeddah on Thursday, will be able to enter  Yemen or whether or not this door will also be closed." He ended  by saying: "What can I say? There is no power and no strength  save in God."  <H5>  I Can't Think Straight </H5>   Ahmad Yislam [name as transliterated] said: "Worry is  killing  me. I can't think straight and I can't concentrate. My brother,  mother, father, and child are all there. What can I do? I don't  know anything after the telephone connections were cut off and  trips by air and by sea stopped going to Yemen. Now all we can  do is listen to the news and follow the events and developments  of the war over the TV that one of our colleagues has in his  house after we finish work--which helps us to forget things for  a while. But our hearts and our minds are in Yemen. Really all  we can do is to humbly pray that God will put out the fire of  this war, have people come to their senses, and contain the  crisis before Yemen pays the price of the disturbances and  losses which are more costly than disputes over authority and  other interests."  <H5>  The Radio Is My Friend </H5>   'Ali Muhammad Sa'id says: "My only friend is my radio. That  is how I find out what is going on in Yemen, although I am not  convinced of the truth of everything that I hear over the radio  concerning the causes of the war. Yemen is too big to have  someone try to divide it or exploit it for personal reasons.  Whatever the disputes may be, they should not end up being  fought with bullets, bombs, and missiles. The only place where  brothers should wage their disputes is the negotiating table.  This is the only place where these circumstances and tensions  can come to an end without bloodshed. After the helping hands of  our Arab brothers have been extended, the Yemenis themselves  have to step in and stop this bloodshed, which is increasing  every day because of the outbreak of the conflict between the  two sides." He went on to say: "I am waiting to go back to  Yemen, when flights resume, so that I can be reassured about my  family and relatives--or whoever is still alive among them, I  should say. We pray to God that justice will be done and Yemen  be preserved."  <H5>  Rise in Prices and Lack of Security </H5>   Salim Nasir says: "All I know is that there has been an  increase in prices in Yemen and one is no longer safe there, and  this makes life difficult. We heard promises that there would be  an improvement in the situation and that those who were corrupt  and committed fraud with the wealth of the nation would be  punished. But all of these resolutions remained merely pieces of  paper until the war broke out. We don't know what the extent of  the effects of this war will be if it is not snuffed out right  away. Certain considerations, fears, and results must be taken  into account before it is too late. All we can do is to wait and  see what tomorrow will bring us in terms of events."  <H5>  First and Last Group </H5>   In reply to a question about what his feelings were,  Muhammad  'Abdallah said: "We have been the first and last group of  pilgrims to arrive in Saudi Arabia since the airports in Yemen  were bombarded. We are praying to God here in the Holy Mosque  [in Mecca] and in the Prophet's Mosque [in Medina] that this war  will come to an end and that all the parties start a dialogue  and be guided by reason."    After a moment of reflection, he added: "My wife and I left  our children in Yemen. We have tried to call them on the phone,  but have not been successful. Telephone communications have been  cut. All we can do is follow the news, wait, and pray."    In addition to this, a fight broke out between a number of  Northern and Southern Yemenis after an argument between the two  sides concerning the situation in their country and the reasons  for the conflict and the war. A number of people were injured,  and it ended only when a number of older people intervened to  stop the fight and to say that any victory by one of the two  sides in Yemen would be a loss for everyone, since the killers  and the persons killed, and the victors and the losers, are all  Yemenis. For this reason, it is in the interests of Yemen that  this war, which is being waged on its territory, be stopped.</p>

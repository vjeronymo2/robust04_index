			<p><P> April 29, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHURCH, SYNAGOGUE MEMBERSHIP REACHES NEW LOWS, POLL FINDS  </P> <P> The percentage of Americans who identified themselves as members of a church or  synagogue in 1988 -- 65% -- was the lowest since the Gallup Poll began tracking  such figures in 1937.  </P> <P> Church membership and attendance figures for 1988 were also unprecedented for  American Catholics:  </P> <P> * For the first time, Catholics were no more likely than Protestants to be  church members.  </P> <P> * Church attendance among Catholics reached an all-time low, with 48% saying  they had attended church in the past seven days.  </P> <P> * The historic gap between Catholics and Protestants on church attendance all  but disappeared. Catholics were only three percentage points more likely than  Protestants to attend church weekly; the gap had never fallen below double  figures before.  </P> <P> The previous low for overall church attendance was 67% in 1982. As recently as  1985, 71% of Americans claimed membership in a church or synagogue. In 1987,  69% of Americans were church members.  </P> <P> Decreases were largest among college graduates, those with less than a high  school education, adults under 30 and Catholics.  </P> <P> Church membership declined sharply among Catholics and remained fairly stable  among Protestants, so that 72% of each group claimed church membership.  Catholics have historically been more likely than Protestants to claim church  membership. In 1987, for example, 79% of Catholics and 73% of Protestants were  church members.  </P> <P> Ironically, church attendance actually increased by two percentage points in  1988, when 42% of Americans said they had attended church or synagogue in the  past seven days. While attendance declined among Catholics (from 52% to 48%),  it increased significantly among Protestants (from 38% to 45%).  </P> <P> The largest single decrease in church membership was among college graduates.  While 74% were church members in 1987, membership fell by 10 percentage points  to 64% in 1988. There was a similar nine-point decline at the other end of the  educational scale. Among those with less than a high school degree, membership  fell from 69% to 60%.  </P> <P> The membership decline was consistent by region. Membership in the East fell by  five points, to 64%; by three points in the Midwest, to 68%; by five points in  the South, to 71% and by five points in the West, to 53%.  </P> <P> Among evangelicals, those who describe themselves as "born-again Christians,"  membership fell by only one point, to 87%. Among non-evangelicals, membership  fell by three points, to 59%.  </P></p>

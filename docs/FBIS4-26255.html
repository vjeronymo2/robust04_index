			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By correspondent Zhang Zhenliang (1728 2182 5328)] </F>   [Text] Shanghai, June 16 (XINHUA) -- A 10,000-line  terminal program-controlled interchange system for international  telephone calls and a 30,000-line terminal program-controlled  interchange system for domestic calls that make up an extension  project hailed as the "giant highway interchange" for  long-distance communications were checked and accepted by the  Shanghai Posts and Telecommunications Bureau, which was  entrusted by the Posts and Telecommunications Ministry.    The completion of these two major interchange systems  increased Shanghai's total capacity for long-distance  communications interchange by 25 times over a decade ago and  upgraded the degree of full automation of its long-distance  communication to over 97 percent from 10 percent in 1985.    It has been learned that the 10,000-line terminal  program-controlled interchange system for international  telephone calls, which was operational upon completion, has been  put under a test run; while 10,000 long-distance lines of the  30,000-line terminal program-controlled interchange system for  domestic calls have been opened to communications, with the  remaining 20,000 reserved for future expansion.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas has made an  official appeal, asking to admit Lithuania to NATO. Speaking on  Lithuanian television on Tuesday, the president said he had sent  a letter to Secretary General of NATO Mr. Manfred Woerner, by  which, taking into account a parliamentary resolution, he had  officially appealed to admit Lithuania to the North Atlantic  Treaty Organization.    In his letter, Mr Algirdas Brazauskas expressed hope that  the  NATO summit, due January 10 through 11, would open possibilities  for the central and east European states to join that  organization. The president said Lithuania's standpoint toward  its membership in NATO was not aimed at confrontation with  either the neighboring countries or any other European state.    Lately the right-wing opposition has been criticizing the  Lithuanian president and the governing Democratic Labor Party  for too irresolute a position toward Lithuanian membership in  NATO.    Meanwhile, the leader of the right-wing opposition, Mr.  Vytautas Landsbergis, has expressed hope that the letter of the  Lithuanian president to the NATO secretary general will attract  attention in the West. As the opposition leader put it, then  Lithuania will stand side by side with Poland, not only on the  map of Europe, but also on the list of candidates for membership  in NATO.    Mr. Landsbergis on Tuesday made a statement falling in line  with that by the president, that Lithuania is seeking stability  and protection, and that this, in his words, is not a threat or  humiliation for anybody.    The opposition leader said Lithuania's desire to join NATO  did not run counter to the U.S. partnership for peace initiative.</p>

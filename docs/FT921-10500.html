			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / Former Inkatha Freedom party member arrives for Goldstone inquiry Mr Bgongani Khumalo, a former Inkatha Freedom party member, arrives for the second day of hearings at the Goldstone commission of inquiry into a 'third force' behind violence in black townships over the past two years. Mr Khumalo has made various claims about military involvement in training Inkatha supporters to combat African National Congress supporters. Mr Justice Goldstone, the judge investigating public violence, said on Tuesday evidence provided by the ANC and the anti-apartheid Weekly Mail newspaper had so far failed to support charges that the military was funding violence at present.</p>

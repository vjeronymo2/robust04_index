			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / Wary response to China plan Asian contractors and western equipment suppliers were yesterday pondering the opportunities offered by Chinese plans to spend as much as 700bn yuan (Pounds 81bn) over the rest of the decade in upgrading the country's transport and service infrastructure. But a degree of wariness greeted the plans announced on Wednesday by the official Xinhua news agency, which said foreign participants would be encouraged to invest in joint ventures or as sole operators for the railway, highway, waterway, pipeline and civil aviation schemes Beijing envisages. Some operators in the Chinese market noted that, while the authorities are clearly concerned that inadequate transport is holding back growth potential in the economy, large-scale national programmes announced in the past had amounted more to wish-lists than realistic shopping lists. Others, pointing to the difficulties inherent in doing business in China, added that infrastructural projects rarely offered the best returns. Companies in Hong Kong are arguably best placed to benefit from China's need for foreign participation in infrastructure development. They already dominate foreign investment in road, rail, and electric power and are important players in the mainland's emerging market for telecommunications services. In spite of peerless guanxi (connections) many have encountered difficulties at the working level. Hopewell Holdings is currently building a six-lane toll-way between Shenzhen and Guangzhou in Guangdong. The road was due to be open in June this year. By the end of the year, at best, two phases of the four-phase project may be ready. South Korean construction companies, which have been shifting their focus from the Middle East to Asia during the last decade, view China as a new lucrative market. Several proposed ventures have collapsed, however, including the construction of Dollars 10bn motorway between Hong Kong and Beijing that involved Dong-Ah Construction and Pohang Iron and Steel. Japanese banks may be thought of as a source of funding - the railway lines of northern China were constructed under Japanese authority early this century, and Industrial Bank of Japan helped to raise the necessary finance by underwriting Manchurian Railway Bonds in 1907. But one banker in Tokyo yesterday suggested that infrastructure projects such as railways and ports appear to be among the least attractive in China, as ensuring a flow of hard currency for repayment would be difficult to arrange. Most of the Japanese institutional lending has been aimed at hotel projects and joint venture companies. A China department manager at another Japanese bank, saying that 'China is an awkward place to do business and you have to be aware of the risks,' believed that infrastructural projects 'would have to be very attractive if we were to be involved.' All the same, contractors in the region are pursuing what deals they can. Korea's Dong-Ah, in spite of its other setback, signed a letter of intent with the Beijing municipality in July to build motorways, a subway and cement plant in the city with a total value of Dollars 3bn. Hyundai Engineering and Construction is bidding for a Dollars 3bn dam project on the Yellow River, which should be tendered within the next year or two. Of leading Hong Kong companies, Hutchison Whampoa owns 70 per cent of a 500bn yuan container port development at Yantian in Shenzhen, New World Development is involved in road and power station construction in Guangzhou, while Cheung Kong - which also controls Hutchison - has interests in electric power generation. Consolidated Electric Power Asia (Cepa), a unit of Hopewell which it plans soon to float, is building its second thermal power station in Guangdong. Among western suppliers which will be paying particular attention to China's spending plans are those providing railway equipment: the country aims to boost its railway network from 53,000km to 70,000km by the year 2000 and increase rolling stock capacity by 20 per cent. According to Siemens of Germany, because of China's 1.2bn population and car ownership likely to remain at relatively low levels, the country needs an extensive public transport infrastructure. China has a well developed railway equipment industry, with 33 locomotive companies and rolling-stock factories. Steam engine production at the main Datong works ceased in 1988. The main emphasis has been on diesel and electrical units. The majority of China's diesel and electric loco-motives are locally built, but imports also rose sharply in the 1980s, with foreign suppliers including General Electric of the US, Alsthom of France (now GEC Alsthom) and Electroputere of Romania. Rolling stock has been supplied from the former East Germany. Because of the strong local industry, Asea Brown Boveri, the Swiss-Swedish group, believes opportunities are more likely in supplying sophisticated components rather than complete foreign-built vehicles. Technology transfer for modern locomotive propulsion is one option. ABB has signed a letter of intent for a joint venture to produce signalling equipment, which it sees as a way for China to better use of its railway network, safely. Siemens also stresses the importance of local partnerships, and sees two key opportunities from the Chinese market. The first is in urban mass transit. A consortium including Siemens and AEG last week clinched a DM700m (Pounds 277.7m) deal to supply the trains and related electrical equipment for an underground railway in Guangzhou in the southern province of Canton. Similar projects could be available in six or seven other Chinese cities in the next five or 10 years, Siemens said. The second main opportunity is in national railway services, where China is considering building a high-speed rail network. The first step would be a line from Beijing to Shanghai, which China has already been discussing with the big western suppliers, notably Siemens with its ICE train and GEC Alsthom, which builds the TGV. Expansion of the railway network also creates export opportunities for suppliers of premium grade rails such as British Steel. The UK steel producer sold 10,000 tonnes of such rail to China last year and yesterday welcomed the planned network expansion.</p>

			<p><P> April 5, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TWA OWNER IS SAID PONDERING EASTERN BUYOUT;  </P> <P> AIRLINES: CARL C. ICAHN IS REPORTEDLY TALKING WITH CREDITORS OF THE BANKRUPT  COMPANY, BUT AN OFFER HAS NOT YET BEEN MADE.  </P> <P> As the unsecured creditors for Eastern Airlines step up pressure to sell the  carrier, Trans World Airlines owner Carl C. Icahn has resurfaced as a possible  buyer, sources said Wednesday.  </P> <P> Icahn and his associates held informal discussions recently with  representatives of Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co., financial advisers to the  committee of Eastern's unsecured creditors, said the sources, who spoke on  condition they not be identified. The talks have been preliminary, and the  notion of an Icahn bid for Eastern has not yet "ripened," one of them said.  </P> <P> Eastern spokesman Robin Matell declined comment on the matter. Icahn's office  said he was unavailable for comment, and aides at Goldman Sachs did not  immediately return phone calls.  </P> <P> Goldman Sachs reportedly told the committee recently that TWA is not interested  in bidding for Eastern, but a source close to the airline company said there is  some interest.  </P> <P> The creditors' committee, exasperated by Eastern's mounting losses, voted  Tuesday to reject the airline's latest reorganization proposal and to seek the  appointment of a special trustee to sell Eastern. The creditors have been  soliciting possible buyers behind the scenes in recent weeks, sources say.  </P> <P> Icahn, a corporate investor who took TWA private in October, 1988, appears to  have emerged as the predominant potential buyer, the sources said. They  suggested he might bid for Eastern in concert with other investors.  </P> <P> Icahn's interest in Miami-based Eastern goes back at least to September, 1988,  when members of Eastern's machinists union met with him about a possible bid.  After Eastern's filing for bankruptcy protection on March 9, 1989, and the  subsequent collapse of an attempted buyout led by ex-baseball Commissioner  Peter V. Ueberroth, Icahn was the unions' favorite to buy the strike-plagued  airline.  </P> <P> Machinists, pilots and flight attendants struck Eastern on March 4, 1989.  </P> <P> Icahn was TWA's white knight in 1986, buying the airline in a $440-million deal  to thwart an attempted takeover by Frank Lorenzo, chairman of Eastern's parent  Texas Air Corp.  </P> <P> Industry analysts have noted a potential compatibility between Eastern, which  operates mainly between the Northeast, Florida and Atlanta, and TWA, which is  strongest in transatlantic operations.  </P> <P> But Icahn backed off from Eastern last May. TWA said it needed more time to  discuss with its unions the feasibility of integrating the TWA and Eastern work  forces and was not prepared to submit a formal bid at that time.  </P> <P> Eastern, battered by the strike, continues to report losses and is having  difficulty attracting passengers. The rebuilt airline has sold more than $800  million in assets with the approval of a U.S. bankruptcy court and would now be  valued at far less than the $464 million offered by the Ueberroth group.  </P> <P> TWA has problems of its own. It recently reported a net loss of $298.5 million  in 1989.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Renate Koecher report: "Flourishing Landscapes, Wilting </F> Moods?"]    [Text] Eastern Germany received promises of flourishing  landscapes, but during the first three years of unity it was  necessary to work hard and clean up a country ravaged by  socialism and a planned economy. Now, in the spring of the  fourth year after unity, the fruits of this immense cleanup  effort are visible. Sixty-seven percent of east German survey  respondents have said that things are clearly looking up in  their immediate surroundings. Their observations are based  mainly on the comprehensive construction work in progress, the  improvements to the infrastructure, and the new shops and  factories. Only a fifth of the respondents were despondent,  claiming that nothing was changing and that there were no signs  of any improvement in eastern Germany.    The population of eastern Germany is experiencing unity  differently than are west Germans, for whom unity was mainly a  news story. Ninety-two percent of the east German respondents  and 37 percent of the west German respondents claim that unity  has changed their lives. Most of the respondents in the old  laender who said they had noticed changes painted a rather  negative picture, and many of them said that the financial  burden of unity was a major contributory factor to the  recession. The great majority of the east German respondents,  61 percent, said they had personally profited from unity, and 25  percent said they had suffered because of it. The proportion of  people in the latter category has been falling for two years,  whereas the proportion of people in the former category is  rising all the time.    What is remarkable is that many respondents mistrust their  own generally positive experience and have a more negative  opinion of general developments than is justified by the  reality. Eighty-five percent of the respondents in the new  laender are convinced that the situation of women in eastern  Germany has deteriorated as a result of unity. But in fact,  most female respondents, just like male respondents, have a  generally positive opinion. Fifty-seven percent of female  respondents said their personal situation has improved since  unity, 21 percent said their situation has deteriorated, and 16  percent see no difference.    The financial situation of east German households is  improving rapidly. Already in October 1990, 34 percent of these  households could afford to buy more than before the turnabout,  one year later 39 percent could do so, and today 47 percent of  households can afford more than they could before the changes.  On the other hand, the proportion of those suffering a decline  in their living standards is at a constant 16 percent. The  widespread view that the increased incomes have been completely  swallowed by rising costs is false. The amount of money east  German respondents claim to have at their disposal at the end of  the month after paying all their living expenses is rising from  one year to the next. The financial disparity between  households in the old laender and households in the new laender  is rapidly equalizing. Altogether, 58 percent of the  respondents in the new laender say that their economic situation  has improved over the past three years. In the old laender, only  6 percent of the respondents say their situation had improved  over the past three years, and 32 percent say their situation  had deteriorated. But that also means that despite the high  cost of unity, two-thirds of west German respondents have at  least been able to retain the standard of living they enjoyed in  1990. In 1986, 12 percent of west German respondents claimed  they could afford little, in 1990, 7 percent said so, and today  13 percent are saying so. In the new lander, 20 percent of the  respondents still say their financial possibilities are limited.  The proportion of people who say that they can only meet their  living costs with great difficulty is small, both in the old and  in the new lander, and hovers between 1 and 2 percent.    Now that freedom is here, the present has become more  demanding and the future more uncertain. Few people were  prepared for the change in interpersonal relationships that  occurred with the collapse of the Wall, especially the change to  the small social relationships that were based on a mutual  dependence and confidence that can only arise under harsh living  conditions. Eighty-seven percent of the east German respondents  said interpersonal relationships have deteriorated since unity.  Almost every other respondent also finds that the climate in  workplaces has become colder and more unfriendly than before.  Many are having trouble with the new, more sober attitude that  employees have toward their own enterprise, an attitude that has  virtually displaced the convivial tone that existed in the  workplaces of the former GDR. Many people still feel unsure and  not at home in the new system.    However, the joy brought by unification has never been taken  seriously in eastern Germany. Despite all the disillusionment  and difficulty, 56 percent of the east German population  consider unity a reason to be joyful. Only 23 percent consider  it a cause for concern. The advantages of unity are too great,  the progress in reconstructing the new laender too obvious, and  the newly won freedom too precious to be able to dampen this  joy. Pride in what has been achieved is again slowly increasing.    The Germans have become despondent over the problems  connected with restructuring and the economic slump. The  majority feared that everything was going in the opposite  direction to the one intended, and would have to be tackled in a  different way. For two years, bad news about the situation of  enterprises and growing unemployment figures clouded people's  views of the visible successes. If in 1991 most people viewed  the reconstruction in the new laender as a good performance, in  1992 many were clouded in doubt. But today, pride is growing in  the east and in the west -- 46 percent of west German  respondents and 40 percent of east German respondents consider  the reconstruction in eastern Germany a good effort. Only 33  percent of respondents disagree.    This pride has not yet spread to the whole of Germany. Both  east and west Germans are upset, thinking that their own  contribution to the reconstruction of eastern Germany has been  unfairly assessed. Eighty-one percent of the population in the  new laender is under the impression that the west has not enough  respect for their effort, and 69 percent of west Germans think  that eastern Germany has not afforded suitable recognition to  their contribution to this great work. But it is just a matter  of time before pride in the reconstruction of eastern Germany  joins the Germans again, just like it did during the postwar  economic miracle.</p>

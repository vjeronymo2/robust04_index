			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Philadelphia Fed data provide some support Wall Street Advancing technology stocks pushed the Nasdaq small-capitalisation market to record heights yesterday. Meanwhile, blue chip issues on the New York SE picked up after a mid-morning setback to post gains on the day, writes Frank McGurty. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 16.99 ahead at 3,865.14, while the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 added 1.47 at 470.89. In the secondary markets, the American SE composite inched 0.81 up to 470.63. The Nasdaq composite was a solid 4.86 ahead at 803.85, well above the all-time closing high of 800.47 set on January 31. NYSE volume came to 303.9m shares. Equity prices moved steadily ahead in early trading, supported by comforting data from the Federal Reserve of Philadelphia. Its March business outlook survey showed a moderating growth trend in the region, and a significant decline in prices paid by manufacturers. The news set off a flurry of buying in the benchmark 30- year Treasury bond, which had rebounded in the previous two days on a series of data suggesting inflation was in check. But the long bond's rally could not be sustained. As a result, equities gave back most of the morning's modest gains. The second turning point came in the early afternoon, when the blue chips moved forward ahead of today's 'triple witching' expiration of stock options and futures. The Nasdaq remained in positive territory all day, largely on the strength of computer stocks. Lotus Development surged Dollars 5 3/4 to Dollars 85 1/2 on announcing a marketing and development agreement with AT&amp;T. Dow component Caterpillar jumped Dollars 3 1/4 to Dollars 119 1/2 . The heavy equipment maker said it would rehire 1,000 workers because of better than expected demand for its products. AMR, parent of American Airlines, shed Dollars 1 to Dollars 63 after warning that it expected a loss greater than Wall Street's estimate of 24 cents a share. UAL, United Airline's parent, retreated Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 129 1/4 amid uncertainty on the prospects of a proposed employee buyout. Brazil Shares in Sao Paulo closed one per cent down after volatile trading awaiting the outcome of Brazil's debt talks with foreign creditor banks and amid caution about congressional talks over the government's economic plan. The Bovespa index, after touching 13,625 and 14,400, ended at 13,938, off 146 points on the day. On Wednesday the index rose 4.2 per cent. Canada Continued buoyancy in base metal and energy shares helped to take Toronto to another strong close, in spite of turmoil in Canadian debt markets. The Canadian dollar tumbled sharply, pressuring bonds but assisting Toronto commodity shares. The TSE 300 index added 17.6 at 4,543.3 and rises led falls by 475 to 331 after volume of 78.1m shares.</p>

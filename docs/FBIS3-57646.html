			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Aleksandrova] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 27 Jan -- "Russia has rejected the  post-August reform version" -- this was the main result of the  parliamentary elections in the opinion of Gavriil Popov,  chairman of the Russian Movement for Democratic Reforms [RMDR].  He said this today at a news conference devoted to the second  RMDR Congress due to be held on 29 January.    The former mayor of Moscow believes that with the  implementation of the "shock therapy" policy, a westernist  version of reform had been chosen, of which the essential  elements became the dissolution of the USSR and annihilation of  Russia's military-industrial capacity, in which the West had an  interest. He called "shock therapy" a "model for the complete  destruction of the country and its subordination to  international monopolies." In the opinion of Gavriil Popov,  neither the Gorbachev nor the post-August concepts of reform  have solved the main problem for Russia -- the transition to a  postindustrial society, and therefore the country is faced with  the "task of developing a third model for the period of  transition." He insists that the development of "a Russian  model for the post-industrial society" requires "gigantic work,"  which may be done only as a result of the unification of the  centrist forces in Russia.    The RMDR leader believes that there is no need to create a  fuss about the new government. In his opinion, it is a  "caretaker government for a year-and-a-half, the task of which  is to purify the country of the extremes of a westernist policy."    Analysing the reasons for the defeat of the RMDR in the  elections (the movement failed to gather the five percent of  votes necessary to enter parliament), Gavriil Popov gave as one  of the reasons the unsuccessful attempts to form an electoral  coalition with other parties. "We did not expect that Russia  would reject the westernist policy right away," he said, adding  that this was the main strategic mistake of the RMDR. The  movement's congress will be devoted to the results of the  elections and the elaboration of the RMDR's tactics and strategy.    Gavriil Popov said that accusations being made against him  of  corruption in his time as mayor could only be explained by the  fact that after August 1992 he had "come out against the line  being taken by the Russian Government."</p>

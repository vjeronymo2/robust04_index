"Now that North Korea has welcomed Mr. Yi's visit to  Pyongyang, we will discuss the matter with the government,"  party spokesman Pak Chi-won said on Saturday afternoon.    Pak said his party will also consult with many people on  Yi's  possible visit to North Korea since he said inter-Korean matters  require very prudence. [sentence as received]    The spokesman further said his party wishes to take the  occasion to call on both sides of Korea to stop trying to use  the inter- Korean question for their political gains and to  strive to promote genuine reconciliation and unification.    The North KOREAN CENTRAL NEWS AGENCY, monitored here,  reported earlier in the day that Yang Hyong-sop, chairman of the  Supreme People's Assembly, said in a statement the North would  welcome it if Yi Ki-taek visits Pyongyang.</p>

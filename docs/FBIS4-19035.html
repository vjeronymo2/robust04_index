			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Livia Klingl: "External Coercion in the Age </F> of CNN"]    [Text] At the very last moment, the West escaped a blatant  disgrace by attacks on Serbian positions near Gorazde. One  simply could not afford to permit the Serbs to overrun the  Muslim enclave and UN "security zone," which is crammed with  refugees.    However, the question arises why the Serbs were able to  soften up the city for two weeks in full view of the United  Nations, without the West awakening from its lethargy. And why  certain statements played down the danger for the lives of  64,000 encircled people toward the public, while internal UN  papers warned against the dangerousness of Serbian attacks.    The assumption is obvious that the West would have actually  liked to "sacrifice" Gorazde to the Serbs, since eastern Bosnia  was recognized as Serbian long ago. An enclave is a source of  continuous controversies and cannot be administered. If it had  inconspicuously disappeared, there would be one problem less in  the abysses of the Balkans. However, in the age of CNN, such  cynical calculations cannot be maintained without harming one's  own reputation.    However, as a result of NATO's latest signs of life, the  initiative continues to be on the side of those who want --  literally -- to pacify Bosnia. The Russians have not succeeded  in putting their Serbian brothers in their place. The United  States is halfheartedly pursuing its concept for Bosnia -- with  the main aggressors being left out. And the United Nations --  as a representative of states with different interests -- cannot  venture too far. Typical example: The UN argues that the  disciplining of the Serbs served to protect blue helmets.  Credulous individuals might have believed that the lives of  Bosnians had been at issue.</p>

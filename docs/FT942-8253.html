			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / Charges on lorry deaths ruled out The operator of the lorry which ran out of control and killed six people at Sowerby Bridge, West Yorkshire, will not face prosecution for corporate manslaughter. The Crown Prosecution Service said there was insufficient evidence against Fewston Transport, of Skipton, North Yorkshire, although the inquest into the deaths had recorded a verdict of unlawful killing. The company is due in court next week to face charges of using a lorry with defective brakes after its vehicle hit a van on a hill and crashed into a row of shops and houses. Both drivers died along with three women and a two-year-old girl.</p>

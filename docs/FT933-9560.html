			<p>930809 FT  09 AUG 93 / International Company News: Air Canada returns to black with tax rebate AIR CANADA reported its first profitable quarter in almost two years, helped by a CDollars 46m (USDollars 35.7m) fuel tax rebate, writes Robert Gibbens. The June quarter net profit was CDollars 14m, or 19 cents a share, against a loss of CDollars 129m, or CDollars 1.73, a year earlier. Operating revenues rose 2 per cent to CDollars 905m. Second quarter operating profit was CDollars 67m, against an operating loss of CDollars 35m. Air Canada said despite fewer passengers carried, it was the third consecutive quarterly gain at the operating level. The higher yield reflected success in holding down fare discounts and reducing surplus capacity. 'We are getting results from two years of cost-cutting and we are a smaller but more efficient airline,' said Mr Hollis Harris, president. The first-half loss was CDollars 279m, or CDollars 3.77, including a CDollars 80m write-down of Air Canada's investment in GPA, the aircraft leasing group, and a CDollars 64m provision for retirement expenses. A year earlier the loss was CDollars 293m, or CDollars 3.96. Operating revenues were CDollars 1.7bn, against CDollars 1.68bn.</p>

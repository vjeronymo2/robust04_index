			<p>BFN     [Text] Vilnius, May 19, BNS -- The Estonian, Latvian and  Lithuanian chiefs of general staff during a two-day meeting in  Vilnius coordinated a draft treaty on the formation of the  Baltic peacekeeping battalion.    The document is subject to initialing by the Baltic states'  premiers or even by the presidents.    Col. Gintaras Tamulaitis, the Lithuanian acting chief of  staff, told BNS the meeting also discussed the joint military  exercises planned for July. Other issues touched upon included  the next meeting of the Baltic commanders in chief,  establishment of an operational communications system between  the three states, and the activity of foreign military attaches.    Tamulaitis said the meeting was "of great benefit" and that  the three countries' representatives reached agreement in  fundamental issues concerning the Baltic battalion.    The only point of difference was Lithuania's suggestion to  prepare future officers of the Baltic battalion at a Lithuanian  training center. Latvian and Estonian representatives were of  the opinion that each country should itself train its officers.    The chiefs of general staff agreed to meet again at the end  of June.    Estonia was represented at the Vilnius meeting by Lt. Col.  Arvo Sirel, the acting chief of general staff, and Lt. Col. Mart  Tiru, the general staff head of office. Latvia's representative  was Col. Jurne Arnes, the chief of general staff.</p>

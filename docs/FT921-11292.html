			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / International Company News: General Dynamics prepares for defence cuts GENERAL Dynamics, the second largest US defence contractor, has reported fourth-quarter net earnings of Dollars 166m, compared with a Dollars 530m net loss after special charges a year ago. It said the defence spending cutbacks proposed this week by President Bush would reduce its year-end backlog of orders by less than 4 per cent. Nevertheless, General Dynamics, in common with all US defence contractors, is being hit by the sharp reduction in US weapons procurement. Its chairman, Mr William Anders, has adopted a particularly aggressive strategy to cope with the problem. This includes concentration on its core defence operations; selling off peripheral activities, such as Cessna, its business aircraft subsidiary; and returning the excess cash generated by this to shareholders. General Dynamics recently agreed to sell Cessna to industrial group, Textron, for Dollars 600m in cash. Yesterday's Dollars 166m, or Dollars 3.95-a-share, fourth-quarter earnings included Cessna, and for 1991 as a whole the company made Dollars 505m, or Dollars 12.06 a share. Excluding Cessna, the company reported fourth-quarter earnings of Dollars 66m, or Dollars 1.56 a share, on sales of Dollars 2.3bn, and 1991 earnings from continuing operations of Dollars 374m, or Dollars 8.93 a share, on sales of Dollars 8.8bn. The full-year figure included a Dollars 140m tax gain. The fourth-quarter loss in 1990 included Dollars 567m in special after-tax charges, and for 1990 as a whole the company reported a net loss of Dollars 578m after Dollars 881m of charges. Mr Anders said cash generation in 1991 had been better than expected. The company had ended the year with balances of more than Dollars 800m. It now intended to call in two debt issues: the 7 7/8 notes due 1993 and the 9 per cent debentures due 2016. This would reduce debt by some Dollars 350m in the first quarter of 1992.</p>

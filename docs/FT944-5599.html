			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Sharp rise to Pounds 4.6m at Metro Pre-tax profits at Metro Radio Group, the Newcastle-based radio station operator, almost doubled to Pounds 4.63m in the year to September 30, as advertising revenue advanced 23 per cent to a record Pounds 17.7m. The pre-tax rise from Pounds 2.37m was struck on turnover up 22 per cent to Pounds 21.6m (Pounds 17.7m) and included a Pounds 320,000 profit on the sale and leaseback of a property in Stockton. The shares only rose 2p to 406p, but Mr John Josephs, managing director, said the upturn in radio advertising had been well documented and was already in the share price. In calendar 1993, radion, the fastest growing advertising medium, took 3.4 per cent of the total UK advertising expenditure, and in 1994 was expected to approach 4 per cent. The Radio Advertising Bureau has said the figure should rise to 6 per cent in 1995. Part of these rises are because the business has got bigger, said Mr Josephs, but he reckoned that Metro was currently taking between 7 and 8 per cent in the north-east. Earnings grew to 18.6p (9.4p) per share and a final dividend of 5.15p lifts the total to 7.4p (5.5p).</p>

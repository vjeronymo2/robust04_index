			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / International Company News: Declines at machinery makers THE RECOVERY of the shipbuilding market supported earnings at Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Kawasaki Heavy Industries, the machinery makers, which have suffered from a decline in orders from the domestic manufacturing and construction industries. Mitsubishi Heavy reported an 8.4 per cent fall in pre-tax profit to Y62bn (Dollars 503m) for the first half to the end of September on a 9.1 per cent increase in sales at Y1,111.6bn, a record for the company. Shipbuilding had been a burden for Japan's heavy industrial companies until two years ago, but strong demand and reduced competition has left them with full order books and the prospect of a steady increase in ship prices in coming years. Mitsubishi reported that sales at its shipbuilding and steel structures division rose 8.4 per cent, while machinery sales were 7 per cent higher, power systems up 22.6 per cent, and aircraft and special vehicle sales were down 1.2 per cent. For the full year, Mitsubishi Heavy forecasts a 3.5 per cent fall in pre-tax profit to Y150bn on sales almost unchanged at Y2,500bn. Kawasaki Heavy Industries reported a 10 per cent fall to Y4.87bn in pre-tax profit for the first half, and a delay in the delivery of six ships was partly the cause of a 7.7 per cent fall in sales to Y359.9bn. After-tax profit was 17 per cent higher at Y4.17bn. Both Kawasaki and Mitsubishi said the recent appreciation of the yen had put the companies' export divisions under increased pressure, and Kawasaki reported a foreign exchange loss of Y3.6bn for the first half. For the year to March, Kawasaki expects a 2 per cent increase in sales to Y950bn and a 9.8 per cent rise in pre-tax profit to Y22.5bn.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Vladimiro Naranjo, magistrate of </F> the Colombian Constitutional Court, by unidentified station  announcer; place not given; from "Caracol's 0600 to 0900"  newscast--live]    [Text] [Announcer] Good morning, Dr. Naranjo. Would you  explain the procedures that will be followed in the  Constitutional Court in terms of juridical control following the  state of internal disturbance the government decreed yesterday  to prevent an important group of dangerous narcotraffickers and  others charged with subversion and terrorism from leaving prison?    [Naranjo] The procedure is established in the Constitution.  Decrees that acquire the status of legislative decrees the  government issues in exercising Article 213 are passed to the  Constitutional Court for review of constitutionality; it is an  automatic review.    [Announcer] Can the Constitutional Court analyze reasons of  advisability or nonadvisability?    [Naranjo] The Constitution is clear on attributing the  authority to evaluate the circumstances that warrant the  declaration of an internal disturbance to the government; in  other words, it is the government that supposedly has the basic  authority needed to conclude a state of internal disturbance  must be declared whenever there is a serious disruption of  public order, which in the government's opinion imminently  attempts a compromise of institutional stability, state  security, or the coexistence of citizens. The government must  determine such elements.    [Announcer] How much time does the Constitutional Court have  to make a pronouncement regarding the state of internal  disturbance? We understand that before it does so, the Attorney  General's Office must also state its position. Is that correct?    [Naranjo] Correct. The court has a regular period of 60 days  to decide. In cases of states of internal disturbance, as in  this case, those terms are reduced by one-third, or 20 days. As  you noted, the Attorney General's Office must give prior  consent. For that, there are 30 days, but by reducing this by  one-third we are left with 10 days.    [Announcer] The declaration of a state of internal  disturbance is becoming a recurrent problem to prevent dangerous  inmates from leaving prisons. Is this due to the Prosecutor  General's negligence or delayed action?    [Naranjo] I would not like to comment on that yet. As you  can understand, we must make a pronouncement on this subject,  but we cannot state our opinions at this time.</p>

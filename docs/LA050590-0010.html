			<p><P> May 5, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GUN CONTROL LEGISLATION  </P> <P> Georgia -- now there's an enlightened state. In Georgia the only requirements  for gun ownership are an assertion of sanity and a driver's license.  </P> <P> (And, of course, the price of the gun.) One then instantly qualifies for  possession of a killing weapon and becomes the proud owner thereof -- no  inconvenient waiting.  </P> <P> And that's exactly what happened when a mental patient treated for "homicidal  tendencies" bought a gun, hours after his release from a mental hospital. He  then went on a shooting spree, killing and wounding (Part A, April 26).  </P> <P> Gov. Joe Frank Harris, reacting to public furor, conceded that the shootings do  make a strong statement for gun control, at which time pragmatism apparently  struck, and in a brilliant conclusion stated, "I'm not sure any gun control  could prevent something like this from happening."  </P> <P> The good ol' boys in the NRA must jus' love Georgia to death.  </P> <P> ILENE BRISKIN  </P> <P> Beverly Hills  </P></p>

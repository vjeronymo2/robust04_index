			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / Stirling loses three pfennigs against D-Mark Stirling lost three pfennigs against the D-Mark yesterday, closing at DM2.4775. Its weakness was mainly due to the intrinsic strength of the D-Mark, following hawkish comments on German rate cuts from Bundesbank council members. But dealers said that the pound was undermined by uncertainty over the direction economic policy will take under the new chancellor, Mr Kenneth Clarke. Speculation that Mr Clarke might lean towards cutting interest rates brought UK gilt prices down a full percentage point. The FT-SE 100 index of leading industrial shares closed 14.6 points down at 2,840.7. Bundesbank resistance, Page 2; City unsure, Page 7; Currencies, Page 13; London stocks, Page 15; See Lex</p>

			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Supersonic airliner gets new go-ahead THE US government has given the go-ahead to the next stage of the programme to build a supersonic airliner to replace Concorde. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration will start work next year on the second phase to develop the air frame, propulsion and systems technologies over seven years at an expected cost of Dollars 1.2bn, Mr Lewis Williams, Nasa's director of high speed research, said yesterday at an FT conference at the Dubai Air Show. Preliminary design studies have defined the characteristics of the aircraft, planned to enter service early in the next century, which will have twice Concorde's 3,000 nautical miles range and carry 300 passengers, three times Concorde's capacity, at fare levels close to those charged on sub-sonic aircraft. Nasa began research in 1990, evaluating environmental considerations including atmospheric effects, nitrogen oxide engine emissions, noise and sonic boom. That first phase, costing about Dollars 400m, has shown the aircraft to be 'environmentally compatible', said Mr Williams. Although other government agencies, aircraft manufacturers and engine-makers in other countries are collaborating on the supersonic aircraft study, the US appears to be taking a far more active role in research. Nasa's annual high speed research budget has just been increased from Dollars 117m this year to Dollars 197m in 1994, although the agency had asked for Dollars 187m for next year. The US is keen to catch up with the European aerospace industry's expertise and experience in supersonic airliner development through Concorde. However, any future aircraft is expected to involve broad international co-operation because it is widely accepted that the market will bear only one programme.</p>

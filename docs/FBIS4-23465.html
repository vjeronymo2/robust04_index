			<p>BFN     [Text] Lagos, 6 June (PANA) -- The political temperature in  Nigeria remained high Monday [6 June] with a report that  millionaire Moshood Abiola is seeking the support of the United  States Government in his bid to be installed as president of the  West African country. Abiola; who claimed victory [word  indistinct] 12 June 1993 presidential election, which was  annulled by former military ruler, General Ibrahim Babangida,  was quoted by the Nigerian press as having requested  Washington's recognition for the government he wants to announce  before 12 June.    In the letter to the U.S. Vice President Al Gore, extracts  of  which were reproduced by three Nigerian newspapers, Abiola asked  for the U.S. Government to:     -  "Warn the military junta not to kill pro-democracy group  members, labour leaders, women, students and others who plan to  demonstrate or engage in stay at home activity".    -  "Condemn the military regime" for "arresting Ameh Ebute", a  former president of Nigeria's disbanded senate.    -  "Sustaining the ban on visas and all official contacts with  the  dictators," and    -  "Despatch a special envoy of the President (Bill Clinton) to  monitor Nigeria's final transition to democracy".        In the letter which Abiola signed as "president-elect",  published in its entirety by the VANGUARD newspaper, he said:  "It has become clear that the military regime has no intention  of relieving its gruesome oppression of the people, but rather  intends to stay in power and continue the public rape of  Nigeria's precious resources". But a spokesman of the American  Embassy in Lagos today denied comments Monday when PANA sought  clarification on the letter which Abiola reportedly wrote on 3  June to Washington. It was not clear whether the published  letter was sent directly to Washington D.C., the U.S. capital.    The United States and a number of European countries,  including Britain have imposed limited sanctions, such as visa  restrictions on Nigerian Government officials, moratorium on  official aid and suspension of military assistance, following  the annulment of the 1993 presidential election. Abiola, a  multimillionaire businessman, who ran a similar but largely  unsuccessful campaign which took him to the United States and  some European countries for 53 days in 1993, has threatened to  form a rival government to the present military regime of  General Sani Abacha. Abacha took power on 17 November 1993  following the surprise resignation of Ernest Shonekan, head of  the Babangida-appointed interim national government in the heat  of political crisis unleashed by the annulment of the 12 June  presidential election. On taking power, the Abacha regime  dissolved all political institutions including elected local  councils, national and state assemblies, and the two political  parties, the Social Democratic Party (SDP) and the National  Republican Convention (NRC). Caretaker committees have been  appointed for the local councils by the regime, which plans a  national constitutional convention to begin on 27 June ahead of  the unbanning of politics on 17 January 1995, as part of is  transition to civilian rule.    But some political associations, notably, the National  Democratic Coalition (NADECO), are opposed to the conference and  want the military to relinquish power to Abiola. The military  government has responded by saying that the constitutional  conference must go ahead and warned that trouble makers would be  dealt with. A NADECO member, Segun Osoba, a former civilian  governor of Nigeria's western state of Ogun, Abiola's home  state, was arrested Friday by security agents. The VANGUARD  reported that government was preparing treason charges against  former Senate President Ebute. He was arrested Thursday for  allegedly convening a meeting of the disbanded Senate. Ebute was  reported to have issued a statement after the meeting, asking  the military administration, which he described as an "illegal"  regime to quit.    But it appears not all pro-democracy groups are in full  support of NADECO's position, judging by press reports Monday.  A spokesman of human rights group, the Campaign for Democracy  (CD), which led a series of crippling disobedience strikes in  1993 over the annulled 12 June presidential election, is  reported in several newspapers as saying that CD's support for  Abiola's cause is conditional. "If we must genuinely restore  June 12 mandate and support Abiola, we must impose conditions,  because the SDP and NRC have failed to justify the people's  confidence. "The political class has betrayed us," Lagos lawyer  and CD member Femi Falana, said. Abiola, he said, "could no  longer form a government of national unity on the basis of the  defunct political parties... Because the parties have become  moribund while politicians have since pitched their tent with  the military government." The Nigerian Labour Congress, the  country's umbrella labour movement, is reported by newspapers to  have opposed the idea of a rival government by Abiola. The  congress' central working committee reportedly met Friday in  Lagos, and resolved that solutions to the country's current  political crisis could be achieved through the planned  constitutional conference.</p>

			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / International Company News: United faces revolt over employee ownership plan United Airlines, the biggest carrier in the US, is facing the threat of a shareholder revolt over its plans to give employees a 55 per cent controlling stake in the company in exchange for labour concessions. One of the company's biggest institutional investors, the Pennsylvania-based Vanguard/Windsor Funds, yesterday said the proposal was against shareholders' best interests and it would vote against it. The fund speaks for nearly 10 per cent of United's shares. A defeat of the employee ownership plan would be devastating for United. The airline's future strategy for fighting back against competition from low-cost carriers such as Southwest Airlines depends on the labour concessions it will produce. If the plan collapses, United is likely to axe hundreds of unprofitable short-haul domestic routes and start contracting out services such as catering and maintenance. The resulting heavy job losses could provoke a head-on confrontation with the airline's powerful labour unions. Under the plan drawn up last year, employees were to swap Dollars 4.9bn worth of labour concessions over the next 12 years for a stake of 53 per cent to 63 per cent of United's shares, depending on how the share price performed. United said the plan was the best hope for the airline, but some shareholders were concerned that if employees gained control they would put their own interests ahead of other shareholders'. That concern grew when United gave in to pressure from the pilots' union last month and lifted the employees' stake to 55 per cent to compensate them for a decline in the share price. Vanguard/Windsor Funds said yesterday the move was the last straw. United said yesterday it believed the transaction was in shareholders' best interests. The plan, awaiting approval by the Securities and Exchange Commission, is expected to be put to a vote later this month or early in July.</p>

			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / Pension rush as Italians fear cut Employees of the Italian state are rushing to cash in on early retirement pensions, for fear of cuts in the current generous system of benefits. In the first four months of this year, INPDAP, the entity responsible for public sector employees' pensions, yesterday reported it had received 29,260 requests for retirement. This compared with estimates, drawn up for budgetary purposes, of 14,580 and of 43,700 for the year as a whole. The increase has been caused by the previous government's warnings on cuts in pension benefits and the new government's election pledge to end generous early retirement pensions. INPDAP said more than 90 per cent of the requests had come mainly from people working in local government and municipally run bodies who had been in their jobs for only 20 years on average.</p>

			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / International Company News: Sharp falls at Dutch paper groups THE NETHERLANDS' top three paper and packaging groups - KNP, Buhrmann-Tetterode and VRG - yesterday released figures indicating a steep fall in profits for 1992. The three companies, which last year announced plans to merge into the second biggest paper group in Europe, after Stora of Sweden, warned of a continued deterioration in market conditions during the first half of the current year. KNP, the biggest of the three, said its profit before extraordinary items fell to Fl 79.4m (Dollars 42.6m) in 1992, down Fl 280m, on turnover of Fl 4.7bn. Including extraordinary gains and losses, the comparable figures are Fl 295m for 1991, against Fl 56.7m. Buhrmann-Tetterode saw a slight rise in turnover from Fl 5.58bn to Fl 6.3bn, but earnings halved from Fl 193m to Fl 85m. Net profits, including extraordinary results, fell from Fl 103m to Fl 50m. At VRG, profits tumbled from Fl 53m to Fl 21.5m, in spite of a sales advance of 13 per cent to Fl 3.5bn. Detailed figures are to be released by all three companies in early April. 'These are not good results,' conceded a KNP spokesman, 'but if you look at the condition of the market and the losses being turned in by our competitors, especially in Sweden, we are glad to have made a profit.' Difficult market conditions will persist in the first half. 'Despite current adverse recessionary influences,' however, the merged company expects it 'can not only maintain, but also improve its competitive position.' Nevertheless, rationalising the operations of all three groups will 'initially involve costs,' the statement added. Under the terms of the planned merger, Buhrmann shareholders are being offered one share in the new company, to be named KNP BT, for every share they own. VRG shareholders will receive 0.8 shares for each existing share. The combined group hopes to be better placed to compete in the increasingly consolidated European marketplace. The merger terms are to be put to shareholders for approval at a series of meetings scheduled later this month. The merger offer expires on March 5.</p>

			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / The Cyprus communique The Commonwealth heads of government met in Cyprus from October 21 to 25. Of the 47 countries that attended the meeting, 36 were represented by heads of state. GLOBAL TRENDS AND PROSPECTS Heads of government welcomed continued easing of global tensions and expressed conviction that the United Nations was now better placed than ever before to fulfil its role. . . They underscored the complementary role which the Commonwealth and regional organisations could play in supporting the efforts of the UN. They reaffirmed their commitment to democracy, fundamental human rights, the rule of law, the independence of the judiciary and just and honest government as essential ingredients of the Commonwealth's fundamental political values. Democracy, development and respect for human rights and fundamental freedom were inter-dependent and mutually reinforcing. Commonwealth leaders stressed the need to strengthen international security through disarmament and non-proliferation. They noted the world economy faced grave uncertainties but believed the current climate of low inflation and declining interest rates presented opportunities for economic recovery. They welcomed the broadening political consensus on market-friendly measures, combined with human resource development and poverty reduction. They acknowledged special difficulties of sub-Saharan Africa and noted the performances of many countries were constrained by weak commodity prices and deteriorating terms of trade. Big efforts were still required throughout the developing world to overcome institutional, economic and financial barriers to stronger growth; they also recognised these reforms should be supported by an appropriate blend of adjustment and external financing. They expressed disquiet at the continuing debt problems of many developing countries and called for measures to cut the debt burden to sustainable levels and for the full implementation of the Trinidad Terms. They noted with concern that official development assistance had fallen in real terms and called for action to reverse the fall in aid flows. Commonwealth leaders noted with appreciation numerous practical measures undertaken by the Secretariat to promote the Commonwealth fundamental political values, including monitoring elections in seven member states. SOUTH AFRICA Commonwealth leaders agreed that developments had marked irreversible progress to democracy. They endorsed lifting of sanctions but the arms embargo would remain until a new post-apartheid government was established with full democratic control and accountability. But the communique recognised that the process remained fragile and agreed the pre-eminent need was to help ensure a united, non-fragmented, democratic and non-racial South Africa. They agreed the Commonwealth Observer Mission to South Africa should remain in South Africa until after the election planned for April 1994 when the situation would be reviewed. MOZAMBIQUE Leaders expressed concern at recurring delays in implementing the October 1992 peace accord and called on the Renamo opposition party to comply fully with its terms, including despatch of its personnel to UN-administered assembly points. They urged all concerned to co-operate in ensuring multi-party elections are held by October 1994 and called on Renamo to co-operate with the government in the speedy completion of an election law. ANGOLA They deplored continuation of the civil war and called on Unita to end hostilities. Failure on the part of Unita to comply with UN Security Council resolutions on Angola would justify further sanctions and other measures. CYPRUS Commonwealth leaders reiterated support for the independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity, unity and non-aligned status of Cyprus. They stressed the importance of securing compliance with all the UN resolutions on Cyprus, divided when Turkey invaded the northern part in 1974. Lack of progress would prompt the Commonwealth secretary general to request the UN Security Councilto consider alternative ways to promote effective implementation of the UN resolutions. MIDDLE EAST Commonwealth leaders welcomed the agreement of September 13 1993 between the government of Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation and expressed the hope that the momentum for peace would be sustained. BOSNIA-HERCEGOVINA They expressed deep concern at the continuing hostilities and urged the international community to make all efforts to arrive urgently at a just, equitable and comprehensive political settlement based on strict adherence to Security Council decisions, international law and preservation and protection of the legitimate rights and dignity of all the Bosnian community. BELIZE Support was reaffirmed for the security, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Belize. The leaders urged Guatemala and Belize to resume and successfully conclude their dialogue.</p>

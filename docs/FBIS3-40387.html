The announcement was made by Aldo  Romano, Science and Technology Park Committee Coordinator for  the Ministry of Scientific Research, at a meeting held to  commemorate the 70th anniversary of the CNR [National Research  Council]. By the end of the year, the organizations whose  proposals have been selected will be required to submit their  general projects and the committee will see to launching the  programs immediately after.    Ministry of Scientific and Technological Research  Undersecretary Silvia Costa stated that the selection of  organizations that had requested funding had been very severe  and only 10 out of the 31 proposals presented have been  considered "buildable" projects. Undersecretary Costa also  explained that no facilities will be built to house the research  and manufactuirng activities, but that there will be  coordination among all the research institutes and companies  connected with them. If projects that necessarily call for the  construction of laboratories and plants are presented, these  will be examined very carefully by the committee.

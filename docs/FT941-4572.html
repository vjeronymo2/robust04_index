			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / International Company News: Sharp third-quarter fall for Heinz Shares in HJ Heinz, the US food company headed by Mr Tony O'Reilly, the Irish businessman, sank to a 12-month low yesterday as the company reported a sharp decline in third-quarter profits. Net income fell by 21 per cent to Dollars 128.6m in the quarter ended January 26, on turnover down from Dollars 1.77bn to Dollars 1.71bn. The shares fell Dollars  1/2 to close at Dollars 31. One reason for the downturn in net profits was an increase in the effective tax rate for the quarter from 34.4 per cent to 40.3 per cent. But pre-tax profits were also badly down, by almost 13 per cent. Heinz said a number of factors were to blame. Two profit-making companies - the confectionery business of Heinz Italy and the Near East specialty rice business - had been sold during the year, and the group's marketing expenses were 19 per cent higher than in the comparable quarter. But the biggest factor was the poor performance of the Weight Watchers business, which draws half its revenues from diet classes and half from diet foods. This suffered from unusually severe winter conditions in the US and from disruption caused by the Los Angeles earthquake, both of which kept dieters at home. Longer-term, Weight Watchers has also been suffering from a decline in the obsession with personal fitness that characterised the 1980s and from a tendency among remaining weight watchers to save money in less prosperous times by making up their own diets. On the positive side, Heinz saw volume gains in beans, ketchup, pet foods and food service products (bulk foods for the catering industry), but these were partially offset by volume declines in the Weight Watchers businesses (meetings and foods) and StarKist tuna. Earnings per share in the third quarter fell from 62 cents to 50 cents. For the nine months to January, turnover was up from Dollars 5.07bn to Dollars 5.1bn, net income rose from Dollars 326.6m to Dollars 473.9m, and earnings per share rose from Dollars 1.77 to Dollars 1.84 excluding accounting changes - though this included a gain of 24 cents a share on the sale of the two businesses.</p>

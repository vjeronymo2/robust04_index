			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / Chancellor scores inflation bull's-eye: Economists are divided over when devaluation will upset his aim IT IS RARE these days for news on the economy to comfort Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor. But yesterday's announcement that underlying inflation had conveniently dropped to the upper limit of his newly announced target of 1 per cent to 4 per cent must have prompted at least a small smile. The retail prices index excluding mortgage interest payments grew by 4 per cent in the year to September, its lowest level for 4 1/2 years. The overall index was unchanged at 3.6 per cent. Even better news for the chancellor is that both measures are expected to continue falling - at least for the time being. While economists are united in their belief that inflation is on a downward path, they are less certain about when sterling's recent devaluation will spur an increase in the rate of price rises. Mr David Walton, an economist at Goldman Sachs, says the outlook for inflation is good because the devaluation was 'superimposed on an extraordinarily favour-able base line for inflation'. He argues that prices will not move sharply upwards in response to the devaluation - as traditional models would suggest - because the economy is still in recession. Mr Walton believes that without the devaluation, inflation would have dropped below zero by 1994. 'Even after the devaluation shock, we expect retail price inflation to drop to 2.5 per cent by the end of next year, and any pick-up thereafter might be very modest,' he says. Mr Peter Spencer at Kleinwort Benson is less sure. 'Although inflation will continue to fall for the next 12 to 18 months, it will become a problem as soon as the economy recovers. There are a lot of latent inflationary pressures . . . most obviously the devaluation itself,' he says. Technical factors will ensure that the headline RPI, which includes mortgage interest payments, will continue to fall for the time being. Mortgage interest payments have a weighting of almost a fifth of the overall index so the recent reduction in base rates to 9 per cent - and any subsequent cuts - will exert a significant downward influence on it as building societies and banks reduce interest charged on mortgages. Technical factors aside, weak consumer demand and rising unemployment should ensure that the underlying rate of inflation - which excludes mortgage interest payments - will also continue its downward path. Growing joblessness will act as a barrier to consumer confidence, without which a strong recovery on the high street cannot take place. Because of that, retailers will attempt to absorb the cost of higher import prices - other than for products where demand is exceptionally buoyant, such as computer games - until they can be confident that passing the increases on to consumers will not damage sales. Professor Douglas Mc-Williams at the Confederation of British Industry says that is already happening. BMW, the German car manufacturer, for example, has not adjusted the price of its new eight-cylinder model that came on the market two months ago. Eventually, however, the devaluation will exert upward pressure on prices. Mr Spencer says: 'We believe inflation will move above 4 per cent towards 5 per cent during 1994 and certainly during 1995. The chancellor has set an extremely ambitious goal that will be difficult to meet even if he adopts a very cautious approach to monetary policy.' Higher import prices will have the most immediate impact on inflation as manufacturers see the prices of raw materials increase. That will be noticed as early as this month in the input price index for materials and fuel. In August, input prices were falling at an annualised rate of 1.9 per cent, but that trend is now likely to be checked, in spite of slug-gish world economic conditions. The output price index - which tracks the prices of goods as they leave factories - will eventually follow, but manufacturers say they intend to absorb the increases for the time being. In the high street, price adjustment will be slower, with margins continuing to take the strain. However, the RPI weights for food, drink and tobacco, household goods and clothing and footwear add up to about 40 per cent of the total index. High import penetration across those sectors would exert pressure on the index. In the longer term, higher inflation and expectations of higher inflation will exert upward pressure on average earnings as employees attempt to protect the value of their real wages. However, as long as unemployment is rising, workers will remain powerless to influence pay settlements. A higher RPI may also, in the long run, raise prices through indexation. Privatised utility prices, for example, are regulated according to a formula using the RPI. The last and most distant phase of the process would be when higher pay deals lead to a further round of price rises and a wage-price spiral begins.</p>

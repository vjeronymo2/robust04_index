			<p><P> October 6, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A VERDICT AGAINST THE CULTURE COPS  </P> <P> Eight ordinary citizens of Cincinnati have used the keen edge of common sense  to cut through the Gordian knot of our fitful and convoluted national debate  over art and obscenity. By acquitting their city's Contemporary Arts Center and  its director of charges they violated obscenity laws by exhibiting photographs  by the late Robert Mapplethorpe, they have sent a clear signal that there are  decisions a free people have no wish to delegate to the hovering officers of a  protective state.  </P> <P> One of those decisions is what does -- and does not -- constitute art.  </P> <P> The intensity of the Cincinnati signal is sure to be amplified by the fact that  no other major city in America has taken so unyielding a stand against  commercial pornography. You cannot rent an X-rated videotape in Cincinnati or  see a so-called adult magazine displayed at your local newsstand. However, you  can -- if you so choose -- go into an art museum and see whatever you deem  worth the time and effort. That distinction -- with all its high seriousness --  was drawn by four men and four women, none of whom had joined the 30,000 other  Cincinnatians who saw the Mapplethorpe exhibit.  </P> <P> In its waning days, the trial seemed to shape up as a sort of battle of the  experts. The defense called to the stand a string of art museum professionals  with unassailable academic credentials, all of whom testified to the aesthetic  importance and validity of the deceased photographer's work. Critics of their  position would hold, of course, that they are precisely the sort of cultural  mandarins who have sacrificed social morality to self-indulgent abstraction. On  the other hand, the record number of Americans who fill our art museums and  galleries each year are themselves testimony to the fact that some significant  number of us are willing to share their opinions.  </P> <P> The prosecution's expert witness was a "communications specialist" whose  services are regularly employed by large evangelical Christian organizations.  She testified that Mapplethorpe's photographs were not art because they  suffered from an "absence of human emotion." She argued further that the  pictures he took of partially clad children -- with their parents' permission  -- were child pornography because the youngsters' genitalia were exposed.  Defense attorneys attacked her testimony because her own artistic career  consisted of a stint as a songwriter for Captain Kangaroo and 30 hours of  formal art education.  </P> <P> It would be a profound mistake to construe the Cincinnati verdict as a choice  between these experts and their values. Rather, it is an emphatic insistence on  the right of every American to make distinctions for themselves according to  their own taste and conscience.  </P></p>

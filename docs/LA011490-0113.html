			<p><P> January 14, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOUISIANA GOP REFUSES TO BACK DUKE FOR SENATE  </P> <P> Louisiana Republicans on Saturday endorsed a New Orleans state senator to  challenge incumbent U.S. Sen. J. Bennett Johnston, decisively rejecting a bid  by former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke, who is now a state representative.  </P> <P> Delegates at the statewide convention picked state Sen. Ben Bagert over  Secretary of State Fox McKeithen, state Rep. Quentin Dastugue of Metairie and  Duke, also of Metairie.  </P> <P> Bagert garnered 451 votes. He was followed by Dastugue with 183, McKeithen with  99 and Duke with 52.  </P> <P> Bagert, 46, had been considered the front-runner for the party nomination after  winning commitments from more than 350 of the 540 delegates chosen at party  caucuses statewide Dec. 9.  </P> <P> The delegates elected at the caucuses, however, had not been required to  support the candidate they said they would vote for.  </P> <P> Duke, 39, won no more than 50 delegates at the caucuses and party officials  said previously that he had little support among party regulars. He said he  would oppose Johnston regardless of whether he won the GOP endorsement.  </P> <P> Johnston, a three-term Democrat, heads the Senate Energy and Natural Resources  Committee.  </P></p>

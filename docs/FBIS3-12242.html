			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tunis, 27 Feb (MENA)--A responsible Palestinian  source has stated that Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat has  informed the United States that he agrees in principle to U.S.  President Bill Clinton's proposal to send a Palestinian  delegation to Washington to hold continuous sessions with a  similar Israeli delegation to discuss starting to implement the  Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles.    The same source said that when 'Arafat received U.S.  Ambassador to Tunisia John McCarthy, he asked for some  clarifications regarding the level of the negotiating  delegations, the date for beginning the negotiations, the reason  for moving them from Cairo to Washington, and the role the  United States will play in these negotiations.    The Palestinian official added that 'Arafat informed the  United States of the need for an Egyptian presence during the  negotiations and that Egypt should play a clear role because it  has been following the negotiations since they started. It has  also been the host country, both in Cairo and Taba, ever since  the Declaration of Principles was signed.    The Tunisian paper AS-SABAH today quoted informed  Palestinian sources as saying that the Palestinian leadership is  in the process of drafting a detailed memorandum to be handed to  the U.S. Administration and the Israeli Government. The  memorandum contains several demands that need to be met before  returning to the negotiating table. The memorandum contains the  following:    1. All those connected with the Hebron massacre must be put  on trial, particularly since the Palestinian leadership has  confirmed information that the massacre was not an individual or  isolated incident as Israel is trying to show, but was conducted  with the participation and the collusion of leaders of their  Army. According to the information, there were more that 20  assailants involved in the Hebron massacre, including soldiers  and settlers.    2. That the settlers in the occupied territories be  disarmed, security settlements be dismantled, and the  settlements' extremist leaders expelled from the occupied  territories and banned from returning there.    3. That the Qiryat Arba' settlement near Hebron, which is a  bastion of Jewish extremists in the occupied territories, be  dismantled.    4. That the issue of Jerusalem be put on the agenda of the  talks and protection given to the unarmed Palestinian  inhabitants of Jerusalem against the practices of the Israeli  Army and settlers, in view of the Hebron massacre.    5. That Israel accept the entry of international troops into  the cities, villages, and camps on the West Bank, including East  Jerusalem, that are not subject to the Gaza-Jericho agreement.    6. That the timetable for the Israeli withdrawals from Gaza  and Jericho be fully honored and the Palestinian security forces  allowed to enter as soon as possible.    The same Palestinian sources pointed out that the majority  among the Palestinian leaders insists on the need to suspend the  negotiations if no "clear-cut and explicit" decision is made to  prevent the settlers' excesses and crimes. The sources noted  that the Palestinian leadership is also awaiting a clear-cut and  explicit stand from the U.S. Administration that would reflect  its credibility in cosponsoring the peace process.</p>

			<p>930628 FT  28 JUN 93 / People: Blue Circle recast prompts departure Hugh Beevor, 49, chief executive of Blue Circle Overseas, has resigned from the board of Blue Circle Industries following a decision to split the building materials group into just two principal operating divisions instead of five. Keith Orrell-Jones, who took over as group managing director last October, says that reorganising the company into two main divisions - Home Products (HP) and Heavy Building Materials (HBM) - will 'provide greater management focus and further reduce costs'. However, the reorganisation has precipitated the departure of Beevor, one of the group's most experienced executives. As boss of Blue Circle Overseas he had been in charge of the most profitable parts of the overseas cement interests. Orrell-Jones refused to elaborate on the reasons for Beevor's departure but analysts speculated that it probably had something to do with the reshuffling of responsibilities of Blue Circle's six main board executive directors. Blue Circle Overseas and Blue Circle Enterprises (BCE), which takes in the group's property interests, are being merged into HBM, which takes in all the traditional cement interests. Under the reorganisation, Tony Jackson, 59, chief executive of BCE, takes responsibility for Africa; David Lovett, 50, president of Blue Circle America, adds South America and marine cement to his portfolio; and Ian McKenzie, 55, chief executive of Blue Circle Cement, has been given all of Europe, waste management and Ockley brick. The responsibilities of Charles Young, who oversees home products, or roughly half Blue Circle's business, remain unchanged. But finance director James Loudon adds the property portfolio to his office. Orrell-Jones says that the overall co-ordination of HBM will be undertaken by himself for the time being but he does not rule out the possibility of appointing someone to do the job at a later stage.</p>

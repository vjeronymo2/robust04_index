			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / Leading Article: UK telecoms It lacked the razzmatazz of the Clinton administration's 'superhighways' rhetoric, but the vision for the future of interactive telecommunications services set out this week by the House of Commons trade and industry committee was just as arresting. The committee raised the spectre of Britain being left behind by the US and Japan if it fails to invest in taking fibre-optics into local telecoms networks. It placed the onus for building such a network squarely, and rightly, on the private sector, which is well able to finance telecoms investments. It would be a mistake to believe that the UK is in fact languishing. On the contrary, it is up with the leaders. BT's long-distance network is entirely fibre-optic, as is a high proportion of its local business connections. Cable operators are building local fibre and coaxial networks with interactive capacity across most of Britain. Within two years, as much as 85 per cent of the mainland population will be covered by cable franchises. The competition which cable operators are bringing to UK telecoms is good for customers, good for innovation and good for British Telecommunications, which remains overwhelmingly dominant a decade after privatisation. It was to encourage such competition that in 1991 the government gave an undertaking not to allow BT to carry broadcast entertainment to domestic subscribers until some time after 2001. BT claims that the ban is delaying investment it would otherwise make in local fibre-optic systems, and parades itself as the only operator able to build an integrated UK superhighway. Seeking to balance BT's claims with the needs of the cable industry for start-up protection, the trade and industry committee has proposed a timetable for ending the BT entertainment ban which would leave the company free to compete across the board by 2003. BT's claims need to be taken with a pinch of salt. It is already investing heavily in local fibre networks, and would be foolish not to do so given the range of business and domestic interactive services not covered by the ban. It would be a serious loss to the UK if steps were taken which undermined the capacity of cable operators to fund their business plans. It is nonetheless in the interests of all parties, and the country at large, that a clear timetable be established for allowing open competition in domestic entertainment. The detail of the committee's recommendation is problematic, but its broad thrust in favour of ending the ban by 2003, and earlier in places where cable companies are well-established, is eminently reasonable. It would give the UK the benefit of state-of-the-art networks and a competitive regime likely to make best use of them. The onus is now on the government to adopt that course. It cannot hide behind Oftel, the telecoms regulator. This is a matter of public policy requiring a government statement.</p>

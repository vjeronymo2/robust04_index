			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / US Budget: Battle to meet Congress limits - Clinton administration still needs to cut another Dollars 10bn of spending THE CLINTON administration faces a fight to cut another Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6.6bn) of spending and raise a further Dollars 10bn in taxes in order to squeeze its budget for next year inside limits set by Congress. The administration published details of its Dollars 1,517bn budget for the 1994 fiscal year on Thursday but, in a reversal of the usual process, Congress has already passed a budget resolution setting totals for revenues and for broad categories of spending on the basis of the outline economic plan President Bill Clinton presented in February. Mr Clinton's detailed budget stays largely within those outlines: spending shifts away from defence and government subsidies towards infrastructure investment, civilian technology, training and education, while higher taxes on companies, richer individuals and energy help to rein in the deficit. 'This plan hacks away at the deficit as a share of the economy, cutting it by nearly one half from 5.2 per cent of gross domestic product in fiscal 1993 to 2.8 per cent in fiscal 1997,' said Mr Leon Panetta, budget director. However, some of the totals have been adjusted slightly since February to correct errors during, in Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen's words, 'those midnight sessions as you're running the computers.' The administration's budget foresees spending dropping from Dollars 1,533bn this year to Dollars 1,517bn in fiscal 1994, which will begin on October 1, and then climbing to Dollars 1,820bn in 1998. Revenues are to rise from Dollars 1,251bn in 1994 to Dollars 1,530.5bn in 1998. This would allow the deficit to fall to Dollars 214bn in 1997 before starting to rise again to Dollars 250bn in 1998. The budget resolution passed by Congress, however, cuts spending by another Dollars 44bn over the five-year period to reach Dollars 1,801bn in 1998, while increasing revenues by another Dollars 27bn. It would trim the deficit to Dollars 193bn in 1997 and Dollars 202bn in 1998. Mr Panetta says the combination of the Clinton budget and Congress's adjustments will reduce the deficit by a total of Dollars 514bn over five years, compared with the levels it would have reached if no action were taken. The programme will raise about Dollars 328bn in new taxes over five years, mostly from lifting the top personal income tax rates from 31 per cent to 36 per cent for single taxpayers with a taxable income above Dollars 115,000 and to 39.6 per cent for incomes above Dollars 250,000. The corporate income tax rate would also rise to 36 per cent for companies with taxable income above Dollars 10m. A new energy tax will be levied at a rate of 25.7 cents per million British thermal units on most forms of energy, or 59.9 cents per million BTUs on oil products. Most renewable fuels, including ethanol, will be exempt, and home heating oil will be taxed only at the basic 25.7 cent rate. Spending will rise on programmes such as roadbuilding, Head Start classes for pre-school children and government research in civilian technologies such as aeronautics, magnetic levitation trains and materials science.</p>

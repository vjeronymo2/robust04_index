			<p><P> May 13, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE KRAFT VERDICT;  </P> <P> FIVE LONG YEARS: PROFILES OF THE KEY COURTROOM FIGURES IN KRAFT TRIAL  </P> <P> For some of the key figures in the Randy Steven Kraft trial, the case has  dominated their professional and personal lives for more than 5 years.  </P> <P> "I wake up at 3 o'clock in the morning thinking about the case," said Kraft  attorney C. Thomas McDonald.  </P> <P> Here is a look at some of the people most involved in the case:  </P> <P> THE JUDGES  </P> <P> Superior Court Judge Donald A. McCartin, 54. He has sent more men to Death Row  (six to date) than any other judge in Orange County.  </P> <P> McCartin is well known among both prosecutors and the defense bar for his  impatience with slow trials. He is also known for showing a quick temper one  minute and a quick quip the next. McCartin sat through most of the Kraft trial  in pain, wearing a brace because of a back injury. Still, when attorneys needed  an extended recess and when jurors began deliberating, McCartin asked for  other, short cases to hear.  </P> <P> Superior Court Judge Luis A. Cardenas, 44. Cardenas, responsible for overseeing  the defense team's spending, remains one of the most controversial figures in  the case.  </P> <P> Many in law enforcement have criticized the amount spent by the defense, which  has not yet been made public. During closing arguments, for example, the  defense lawyers staged a computer graphics presentation of moving color graphs  and charts. Some officials say the defense could have saved taxpayer money by  using cardboard instead.  </P> <P> Cardenas' most controversial ruling was his decision to seal all the defense  expenses on the case, including the salaries of the three defense lawyers. But  Cardenas said it was the only way to assure that jury selection did not occur  in the midst of public debate over the trial's costs.  </P> <P> THE PROSECUTION  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Bryan F. Brown, 47. A former California "prosecutor of the  year," Brown has succeeded in sending three other men to Death Row, including  William G. Bonin, convicted of killing four young boys in Orange County, and 10  others in Los Angeles County.  </P> <P> Brown is a supervisor in the district attorney's office. While he is highly  rated by fellow prosecutors, some defense lawyers complain that Brown plays too  much on his down-home, folksy image with jurors.  </P> <P> Brown entered the Kraft case just a few hours after Kraft's arrest, when he was  called at home to help prepare search warrants for Kraft's house and car.  </P> <P> After the verdicts Friday, many were crediting Kraft's convictions in all 16  murders to Brown's courtroom skills.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Thomas M. Goethals, 37. He has been assigned as the legal  motions specialist on the Kraft case for only about a year. But Goethals shined  during the trial, when he dramatically argued that if Kraft testified, the  defense did not have the right to limit Brown's cross-examination.  </P> <P> Sheriff's Department investigator James A. Sidebotham, 53. Brown claims that  Sidebotham was brilliant in his preparation of the three search warrants that  produced most of the evidence against Kraft.  </P> <P> Sidebotham set a record in the county for remaining on the witness stand for  most of 5 months during the search warrant hearings. The defense challenged  thousands of pieces of evidence.  </P> <P> On Friday, Sidebotham sat in the back of the courtroom and listened to the  guilty verdicts for Kraft.  </P> <P> "We've only cleared the first hurdle," he said.  </P> <P> THE DEFENSE  </P> <P> C. Thomas McDonald, 47. McDonald left the public defender's office, where he  was second-in-command, after the Board of Supervisors balked at allowing him to  take a leave of absence to take the Kraft case. McDonald is known for his fiery  courtroom demeanor. While many prosecutors dislike him intensely, he has many  supporters among the defense bar.  </P> <P> "If Kraft tells you he didn't kill anybody, then you need a lawyer like  McDonald who will say OK, 'that's our position, now let's go in there and kick  some tail,' " said fellow defense attorney Mike Horan. "Anybody who criticizes  McDonald for getting fired up about Kraft's defense is crazy."  </P> <P> James G. Merwin, 45. Although McDonald handled most of the trial, Merwin did  much of the behind-the-scenes work, such as preparing the motion to sever the  case into multiple trials, which the defense considered the most critical  issue.  </P> <P> It was Merwin who brought McDonald into the case. The two are longtime friends  who had worked in the public defender's office together.  </P> <P> Merwin impressed many courtroom observers with his closing arguments, in which  he quoted Roman history, Abraham Lincoln, and his own mother. Merwin has been  particularly sensitive to complaints about how much the Kraft defense was  costing taxpayers.  </P> <P> "I regret taking this case every time I read that I'm stealing funds from the  county," he said.  </P> <P> William J. Kopeny, 38. Kopeny also left the public defender's office to take  the Kraft case. His specialty is legal motions, and Merwin and McDonald  consider him the best at what he does. While he lost most of his motions,  Kopeny won high praise from fellow defense lawyers for his work.  </P> <P> Kopeny, a strong opponent of the death penalty, contends that it was impossible  for Kraft to receive a fair trial charged with so many counts.  </P></p>

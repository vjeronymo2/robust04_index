Iain Houston, above, has moved up to become director of marketing and structured finance in the group's corporate and institutional banking division. Houston, 44, has previously worked for the Sedgwick Group and Johnson Matthey in treasury roles, before becoming in 1988 director of marketing at Charterhouse bank - a joint initiative between Royal Bank of Scotland and Charterhouse - at the bank's capital markets division. In 1992 he became group marketing director. In a separate division of the Royal Bank of Scotland, which currently has some 24,000 staff, Keith Hodkinson, 46, right, has been appointed head of commercial banking services, responsible for the bank's commercial strategy. Hodkinson is a long-serving member of the bank, having joined the former Williams Deacons bank, based in Manchester, in 1965. His previous posts with the bank include manager of international credit control, senior manager in charge of business in Africa, the Middle East and the Indian sub-continent and, prior to his new appointment, as chief manager of international banking services.</p>

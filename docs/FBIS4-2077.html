			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, April 5 (XINHUA) -- Russian President Boris  Yeltsin has proposed a civil peace plan aimed at preventing  political violence in the country.    The Presidential Information Secretary Vyacheslav Kostikov  said that Yeltsin has submitted the accord to parliamentary  leaders, some political groups, and the press.    Yeltsin called on all political leaders and social  representatives to end confrontation and unite to overcome the  economic crisis and the intensified political situation.    He warned that the process of drafting, approving and  implementing the civil peace accord could be destroyed by the  distrust which exists among political blocs.    The six-part draft accord states that the signatories will  neither revise the current constitution nor launch any political  activities aimed at promoting early national elections.    The signatory parties will also shoulder the responsibility  for forbidding the use of violence to solve social problems.    On March 4, Yeltsin decided to sign a similar accord which  aroused controversy among Russia's political blocs.</p>

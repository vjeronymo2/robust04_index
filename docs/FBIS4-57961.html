			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mario Jovel from the "Up-to-Date" newscast] </F>   [Text] On Monday, President Alfredo Cristiani, in view of  the UN secretary general's latest observations, announced a  special commission will verify that the National Civilian Police  [PNC] is not militarized.    The president disclosed that this commission will comprise  an  Onusal [UN Observers for El Salvador] representative as well as  National Public Security Academy [ANSP] and PNC directors.    In an 11 May report sent to the UN Security Council, UN  Secretary General Butrus-Ghali states that former security corps  sergeants are in charge of PNC criminal investigations, and  members of the former antidrug unit are taking the posts of  commissioners. The report adds that ANSP graduates are  discriminated against because none of them have been appointed  commissioners. Ghali has called for these mistakes to be  corrected to avoid having the PNC become more militarized. The  president, however, rejected these assertions.    [Begin Cristiani recording] We disagree with this report.  Last week, we brought everything up to date just as we had said  we would do, including the public security topic. For the  secretary general's peace of mind, a commission is being created  to verify whether this is true. On no account have we attempted  to militarize the PNC. [end recording]    The commission that will verify the civilian nature of this  new security corps will include ANSP Director Mario Bolanos, PNC  Director Jose Maria Monterrey, and one Onusal representative.  In the same report, Ghali explains that persistent deficiencies  have been found in the training of PNC members in legal matters  and in the use of force and firearms. For the president, these  failures have an explanation:    [Begin Cristiani recording] One must remember that we are  trying to hurry and deploy the units as soon as possible and  that exclusive courses lasting six months are being given with  much effort. These courses are insufficient to create a  completely trained public security policeman. To my way of  thinking, once the PNC has been fully deployed, we need to  continue to give members courses and training. [end recording]    Likewise, Cristiani said that another special commission  will  be created to verify the enrollment of PNC members in the ANSP,  which should not surpass 1,000 members or 20 percent of the  total. According to the president, it was agreed in last week's  meeting to clear all pending matters that the demobilization of  the former security corps will continue until 31 March 1995.</p>

			<p>920526 FT  26 MAY 92 / US to send Haitians home LEGAL challenges were planned yesterday to the latest US order requiring its Coast Guard forcibly to return fleeing Haitian boat people. President George Bush issued the directive on Sunday, saying that US facilities at its Guantanamo naval base in Cuba were being swamped by the flow of Haitian refugees - now estimated to exceed 12,000, and raising fears that southern Florida would also be overwhelmed. He thus reversed an earlier decision last Thursday ordering that Haitian boats not be intercepted. Human rights and legal groups representing Haitian refugees objected that forcibly returning the Haitians without first ascertaining their right to asylum in the US was a violation of international law. Congressman Stephen Solarz, the New York Democrat, yesterday called the US decision a cruel move that 'betrays our most fundamental values'. The White House cast its action in humanitarian terms, saying many of the boats were patently unseaworthy and it was continuing to screen asylum petitions, mostly in Guantanamo but also in Haiti itself. It said that since last September's coup, about 9,000 out of 34,000 applications for asylum had been processed and 6,000 US residency permits granted. However, US policy has been to deter Haitians from fleeing their island.</p>

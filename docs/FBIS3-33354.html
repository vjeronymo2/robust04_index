Colonel Edgardo Cuellar, police commander in Meta  Department,  said that among those released is Jorge Perez, the ruling  Liberal Party's candidate for the Chamber of Representatives who  was kidnapped last Sunday on a highway in the area. According  to the source, the candidate is the bearer of a message from the  guerrillas to the Colombian Government in which the guerrillas  ratify their support for regional peace dialogues as an  instrument for ending the armed conflict in this South American  country.    Leovigildo Criollo, Perez' campaign coordinator, and Jose  Lozano, mayor of Puerto Rico, Meta Department, were also  released with Perez. "They treated us well. They only wanted  to send a message of peace to the government," Lozano told local  media.    Also released were city mayors David Delgado of Alejandria  and Jaime Alonso Cano of Santo Domingo as well as John Jairo  Duque, president of the Santo Domingo Council, all of whom had  been kidnapped earlier by members of the Revolutionary Armed  Forces of Colombia (FARC) and were released in San Rafael,  Antioquia Department.    The Simon Bolivar Guerrilla Coordinating Board, which groups  the two largest rebel groups in the country, began an offensive  early this year to sabotage the legislative and presidential  elections scheduled for March and May, respectively. As part of  this offensive, tens of political party offices have been  destroyed and five candidates to parliament and four mayors have  been kidnapped in Antioquia, Tolima, Cundinamarca, Arauca, and  Meta departments.    President Cesar Gaviria's administration announced that in  view of the guerrilla offensive, the authorities have redoubled  surveillance of the political groups and increased the corps of  bodyguards for the various candidates. In addition, it warned  that the wave of attacks will not intimidate the population, nor  will it suspend the elections in any part of the country.</p>

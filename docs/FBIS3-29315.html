			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] It was disclosed on 15 February that, at the  bidding for the government procurement of 11 supercomputers with  funds provided in the first supplementary budget for fiscal  1993, six supercomputer systems would be procured from U.S.  manufacturers, with the remaining five coming from domestic  makers. Bidding for supercomputer procurement started in  November 1993, and IBM of the United States on 14 February won  the 11th and last bid -- for a computer ordered for the National  Cancer Center. Of those 11 supercomputers, two of the U.S.-made  computers will be supplied by Cray Research Institute Inc., and  four of the domestically-manufactured computers by Fujitsu. The  Japanese Government considers the result of the current bidding  "proves the procurement was conducted in a fair process."</p>

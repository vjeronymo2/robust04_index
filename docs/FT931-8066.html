			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / Property: Estate agents - if they didn't laugh, they'd cry / The collapse of the residential market has led to hard times for even the biggest players ASK A residential estate agent how business in the UK has been in the last two years and you are likely to hear manic laughter. 'It has been the most bloody awful time,' says Roland Cullum, with sardonic humour. Cullum is a partner of Cluttons, a medium-sized agent with a classy reputation, and admits freely that the going has been gruelling. A healthy estate agency business depends on brisk turnover and a percentage of the sale price - the higher, the better. 'There have been damn-all transactions and static or falling prices,' he says. It has also been much harder work. 'Sometimes, you have to show a house 30 times before you make a sale.' The story is the same all over the UK, even in Scotland, which has been hit least badly in the property recession. 'None of the major chains are profitable at the moment. We are coping with volumes down by 50 per cent and much lower prices,' says Peter Rowntree, the managing director of the 260-branch Legal &amp; General Property Services. Reactions to the common problems of low sales and prices, exacerbated by rising office rents, include closing branches, cutting overheads, franchising, and moving into the popular rental market. Last year, Cluttons decided to pull out of the London market, selling its well-known Chelsea office to Robin Patterson, a former Barnard Marcus executive, and allowing him to use the name Cluttons London Residential Agency. Ann Sturgis, at Kensington-based Malvern's, has been taking on lower-priced properties which some of the larger firms considered too time-consuming. She has also stepped up her letting business to make up for low sales. Legal &amp; General, having closed 76 offices in the past two years, has experimented with franchising. The group has around 40 franchise branches operating under one of its local trade names. 'Franchising seems to be working because an individual with commitment can turn an unprofitable branch round, whereas a manager won't put in that effort,' says Rowntree. These are particular solutions to the national problem of over-capacity at a time of tumbling volumes and rising rents. At the peak of the property boom in 1988, the magazine Estate Agency News estimated that there were more than 16,000 estate agency offices owned by about 11,000 firms. There are now thought to be well under 12,000 offices owned by 6,500 firms, with many one-man bands having gone out of business or been taken over. Almost half of all estate agency branches are now owned by the big institutions - building societies, banks and insurance companies - who waded into the market during the 1980s, often paying what have proved to be exorbitant prices. The idea was to use the retail network of estate agents to market other financial services - mainly mortgages and insurance - to the house-buyer. By late 1989, it had become clear that the numbers did not stack up. The Prudential was one of the first to get out, sending shock waves through the market by shutting or selling more than 500 branches during 1990 after announcing losses of Pounds 49m. Most of the other large institutions have followed suit including Royal Life, which has dropped 243 branches to 517, and GA Property Services, losing 233 to 390 since 1990. Even assuming the housing market recovers in the next two years, there is still considerable over-capacity - estimates vary from 20 to 30 per cent - and all but a handful of existing offices are running at a loss. David Perkins, an estate agent turned independent consultant, sees three clear trends emerging. First, he believes that UK insurance companies and middle-ranking building societies have no appetite for estate agencies and may be bracing themselves to get out entirely. Second, the big building societies, even those which have done well such as Hambro Countrywide and the Halifax, are no longer expanding. But the most interesting development, which could signal the bottom of the market, is that former managers and estate agency entrepreneurs are taking advantage of low prices to re-enter the sector through management buy-outs, buy-ins, or franchising. Not all of these are getting it right. A salutory example is the firm of Franklin Fox, which bought 51 offices from Northern Rock building society six months ago and which, because of a shortage of financing, has only a handful left. Others hope to do better. After 30 years in the business Tony Snarey, formerly at William H. Brown - which was taken over by Royal Insurance  - has bought the right to use the Humberts name and is to open six branches in the north-east of England this spring. 'I believe that the estate agents which will do well are those with good local knowledge and an individual manager who is known and respected.' Patterson also claims to be making money. 'We have turned the business round,' he says. 'We have changed the name and culture and, from a loss of Pounds 250,000, we are now well in profit.' Recently, too, a national newspaper featured the tale of married couple Donald and May Storrie, who sold their 32 offices to Nationwide for Pounds 15m in 1988 but became so bored that they have now started again with one branch. Despite the over-capacity in the market, new businesses have one big advantage: the cost of entry has dropped greatly. To buy a branch from an established chain can now cost only half what it did at the peak, while it is possible to negotiate keen rental rates from scratch. The recession has taught everyone the importance of good financial housekeeping. Upmarket London agent John D. Wood, which recently revealed losses of Pounds 77,000 in the six months to October 31 compared with Pounds 194,000 for the first half of 1991, still has eight offices in London and six in the country, although staff numbers have been trimmed. Cost controls have been paramount. 'One alteration is that we now pass on to our clients the high cost of advertising and glossy brochures,' says George Pope, the joint chairman. At Legal &amp; General, Rowntree instigated strict cost controls in all branches, as has Knight Frank &amp; Rutley. According to Perkins, agents' fees have risen because of the recession but most prefer to talk of it in terms of holding firm or passing on costs. 'When the market was very active, our fees were negotiable. Now they are not,' says Rowntree. Bill Yates, senior partner of Knight Frank &amp; Rutley, agrees. 'It is easier to get good commission rates now. The rate-cutting from the institutional firms has stopped.' And there are signs that things may be improving. John D. Wood reported a threefold increase in viewings during January compared with November, although this has yet to come through in sales. Patterson believes that the number of transactions have risen by 15 per cent in the past two months, and all agree that there is more interest from potential buyers. That might be scant consolation in a market which is staggering along on little more than 1m transactions a year compared with 2m in 1988, but it does offer hope. As if life were not tough enough for the battered agent, there is one other challenge coming along in April when a new law will insist that advertisements and agents' particulars will be actionable if not totally accurate. In future, 'Des. res. only 5 mins from Tube' will have to mean exactly that.</p>

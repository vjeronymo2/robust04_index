			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Winfried Muenster: "Presented as </F> Self-Confirmation"]    [Text] The European Parliament, which German citizens are  called upon to elect on 12 June, takes an almost sporting  pleasure in forcing the finance ministers of the European Union  to spend more money than they like. At the end of their  five-year legislative period, the 518 deputies are presenting a  report on their work to the public. We would have expected that  this parliament, as the second budget authority after the  Council of Ministers, would report on the development of  spending and the most important points of the budget. However,  the budget does not play a role in the deputies' report on their  activities. Rather, a table catches our eye which says by how  many millions the budget was increased above the finance  ministers' drafts at the instigation of the Strasbourg  parliamentarians.    In 1990, the Strasbourg people fought for, and got, the  equivalent of 1 billion German marks [DM] for the young  reforming states of Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic. A  year later, they made sure that Chancellor Helmut Kohl's promise  materialized that German reunification would not take away a  single mark from the member states that traditionally receive  subsidies from the Community. The parliamentarians made use of  the Gulf war to secure additional funds, used their influence on  behalf of refugees from Kurdistan, and increased aid for the  Israeli occupied territories. On balance, they increased the  budget by the equivalent of DM6.6 billion. It should be noted  that the additional means were not only used for the current  year, but had to be distributed over the rest of medium-term  financial planning.    In its profit and loss account last year, the parliament  frankly admitted that it believed it should "counter" on  principle the Council of Ministers' draft following the first  reading, because it was nothing but "a statistical operation of  the finance ministers to reduce the preliminary draft of the  Brussels Commission." So the deputies allowed their imagination  to roam, and in so doing, finally detected the program "Konver"  for the conversion of arms factories to civilian production.  There simply is nothing with which the Strasbourg people would  not deal. Their profit and loss accounting for 1993 amounts to  DM6.8 billion.    In view of European Community budgets that clearly exceeded  DM100 billion, this was not much. The scope of action that the  parliament has been granted is not larger, however, and so the  parliament creates the impression that taxpayers had no  alternative but to flee, if its reins were loosened. Would it  be better from the taxpayers' viewpoint if the European  Parliament did not exist? This conclusion suggests itself, and  yet is basically wrong. The experts of EC Budget Commissioner  Peter Schmidhuber believe they know why the parliament is so  ready to spend money -- because it lacks one of the basic  parliamentary rights, namely fiscal jurisdiction. They say that  within the scope of its limited authority, it can hardly do  anything but call for higher expenditures and increase the  budget in accordance with its leeway of action. A competent  parliament that would have to justify its spending policy to the  voters would, in all probability, for instance, not reserve half  the Community budget for an agricultural policy that is judged  favorably only by large farmers. We cannot contradict this.  Therefore, taxpayers in particular should be interested in a  parliament that would be equal with, not subordinate to, the  Council of Ministers.    In the first years of its existence, parliamentarism  justified itself with the need to control those who govern. In  this sense, all parliaments in Europe have somewhat degenerated.  Moreover, the European Parliament feels bound to the idea of  redistribution to a larger extent than national parliaments. It  shares this idea with the Commission and pursues it, without  considering whether it is politically wise. In the report on  their work, the Strasbourg people note with pride that they  "succeeded in getting doubled, in real terms, the structural  fund accepted." The structural fund includes all subsidies with  the exception of agriculture, research, and social policies. In  the five-year period from 1988 to 1992, it had been increased by  100 percent in real terms. The capital endowment, including the  rate of inflation, increased from DM16 billion to DM37 billion.    At that time, the generous donor countries obviously did  not consider that receivers could declare the five-year doubling  a political entitlement and demand a repetition for the next  five years. This may sound like a joke to the thrifty budgeter.  For the Strasbourg people, it was a foregone conclusion. They  pursue redistribution deliberately and, if necessary, in an  insidious way. In the research budget of the 1995 draft budget,  they reduced subsidies for specific projects in favor of general  titles such as "spreading of scientific knowledge." In this  way, they wanted to make sure that economically strong member  states with good laboratories receive less, whereas the poor  neighbors on the periphery, where there is less research,  receive more. The fact that German citizens must eat more  expensive and worse bananas than before, because banana  producers in France's overseas territories are to be subsidized,  is no problem to the Strasbourg people.    In 1999, the structural fund will have been increased to  approximately DM70 billion. Then the receivers will probably  apply for doubling the fund again. The very parliament that has  taken up the cause of European integration does not see that it  will prevent integration through its bad policy of subsidies and  redistribution.</p>

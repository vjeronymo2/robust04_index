Thirty-two laws are related to deregulation in the economic  field. They include the Foreign Trade Law, the Insurance Law  and the Law on Farmland Ownership.    Legislation Minister Pak Song-kyu reported to the weekly  cabinet meeting yesterday that the Foreign Trade law will be  revised to allow people to engage in international trade by  simply reporting their business to the authorities.    Pak said the regulation on financial support for Korean  businesses which suffer losses because of imported products will  be also modified.    He said his office has already handed in 15 bills to the  National Assembly for consideration. It will seek the  Assembly's approval for the other bills at the upcoming special  or regular sessions.    The government will draw up a bill on development of the  information industry to provide tax benefits to the investors in  this area.    Minister Pak said his office is working to draw up a bill on  the promotion of people's health with a view to providing  regular health checks to all people.    The bill would form a fund for national health promotion  using part of the profits from the sale of cigarettes, a  government monopoly.</p>

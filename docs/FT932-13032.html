			<p>930426 FT  26 APR 93 / Union leaders urge E Germans to vote for strike TRADE UNION leaders across Germany called on steel and engineering workers in the eastern states to vote for all-out strike action today to protect their pay deal for rapid wage equalisation with the west. They warned that cancellation of the contract could undermine nationwide collective bargaining in west Germany as well as in the east. The outcome of the strike ballot in the states of Saxony and Mecklenburg-Vorpommern over the next three days is in the balance, with a 75 per cent vote of all members needed to go ahead with the action. If they vote in favour, the giant IG Metall union is expected to launch the strike from May 3, with a warning that it could last for months. Employers in the ailing eastern steel and engineering industries say that 100,000 workers out of some 320,000 could lose their jobs if the strike goes ahead. They are refusing to pay more than a 9 per cent pay rise from April 1, compared with a deal agreed two years ago to pay a 26 per cent increase on the wage rates existing then - equivalent to a 15.5 per cent increase on current rates. Mr Franz Steinkuhler, leader of IG Metall, told a rally of some 60,000 workers in Leipzig on Saturday that allowing the employers to abandon their pay deal in east Germany would threaten collective bargaining in the whole country. 'We did not vote for reunification (of Germany) just in order to allow the employers to turn east Germany into a cheap-wage colony,' he said. However he left a hint of compromise: if the employers would cancel their legal move to abrogate the eastern pay deal, the union would immediately return to the negotiating table and discuss the timescale of wage equalisation, he said in an interview with the Bild am Sonntag newspaper.</p>

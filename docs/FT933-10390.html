			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Lions roam from Den to seek long-term safety - Millwall Football Club's move to a new home THERE are too many professional football clubs, believes Mr Reg Burr, chairman of Millwall. 'You could get rid of about 25 clubs hanging on by their fingertips.' Millwall, the first division team, is now not one of them. Tonight the south London side, owned by USM-quoted Millwall Holdings, opens a Pounds 15.5m multi-purpose stadium, built - remarkably given the company's Pounds 12m market value - without recourse to debt. The company has had a rocky ride on the Stock Exchange and the club has long been dogged by the reputation for violence of its supporters. But, Mr Burr reckons, the stadium's inaugural match, between Millwall and Mr Bobby Robson's Sporting Lisbon, will mark a turning point in the club's 108-year history and one which he thinks will guarantee football at Millwall for at least 75 years. Millwall Holdings was floated on the USM in 1989 at 20p a share. It started trading in profit, but in 1990 a combination of relegation from the then First Division and an ill-fated foray into the pubs business with the Pounds 10m purchase of Tavern Leisure took their toll. The company tumbled into loss with a pre-tax deficit of Pounds 2.67m in the 10 months to end of May 1991. Losses have since been cut with the disposal of the pub chain, but Millwall has yet to return to profits. The shares now stand at 4 1/4 p. Even before these troubles, the club had decided it must move to a new ground if it was to survive. Now the club, nicknamed the Lions, has left its Den, the old club ground, much to the demonstrated distress of fans, to roam Senegal Fields, the site of its new home, New London Stadium. Although only half a mile down the road, it promises to be a world away from the old Millwall terraces. Much of the cash for the new stadium came from the sale of the Den, a Pounds 3.2m rights issue this spring, and grants from the Football Trust and Lewisham Council, Millwall's local authority. The Den's sale to Fairview New Homes, the housebuilder, yielded Pounds 5.2m. The Football Trust awarded a grant of Pounds 2.5m, the largest it has made to a league side. This was topped up by an extra allocation by the trust of Pounds 250,000, made to fund Taylor report requirements. This report, written after the Hillsborough disaster in 1989, required football clubs to convert their terraces to seats. Lewisham Council, long-time sponsors of Millwall, provided Pounds 2.6m. The stadium includes a community sports hall. The Senegal Fields site is owned by Lewisham and is on a 125-year lease to Millwall. Various other sponsorship tie-ups and schemes make up the rest of the funding. Millwall has struck a 5-year marketing deal with Coca Cola and its kit will be sponsored by Seagram's International, the drinks group. But the new ground is not just for football. Mr Burr is keen the stadium develops a life of its own beyond the football club, producing returns that will sustain the club's development over the long-term. The stadium is designed to host pop concerts, boxing, festivals and other events as well as Millwall matches. Ogden Entertainment Services will handle all non-football events under in a 10-year arrangement, taking a management fee and a percentage of the food and beverage sales. Mr Burr is adamant that with non-football events 'we are not taking a promotional risk'. He sees such off-field expansion as the only way for football clubs to prosper as live soccer is an addiction for a diminishing number of people. It provides another important source of income when clubs are suffering financial pressures on many sides, including falling gate receipts, rising transfer fees, and the expense of implementing the Taylor report. Clubs cannot afford a hand-to-mouth short-term outlook, Mr Burr believes, painting a grim picture of the failing fortunes of football clubs that is born from ailing local economies. 'When I first came into football 30 years ago it was all about 11 men kicking a ball. That was very nice but it isn't like that any more, it can't be.'</p>

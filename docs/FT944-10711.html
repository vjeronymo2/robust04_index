			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / International Company News: Minolta suspends video-camera side Minolta, the Japanese manufacturer of cameras and office automation equipment, said yesterday it was suspending production and marketing of video cameras for the domestic market, AP-DJ reports from Tokyo. However, Minolta said the company would continue to export video cameras made for it by Hitachi on an original equipment-manufacturer basis to the North American market. In recent years, Minolta has lost market share to competitors Sony and Sharp as the Japanese market has grown increasingly competitive. Minolta's domestic sales of video cameras totalled Y2bn (Dollars 20.55m) in fiscal 1992, after peaking at Y10bn in 1987, the company said. For the year ended March 1994, Minolta had total unconsolidated sales of Y184.26bn, with exports accounting for 77 per cent of the total. Minolta stressed that the move did not necessarily mean the company had left the domestic market for good. Minolta shares closed unchanged at Y502 on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.</p>

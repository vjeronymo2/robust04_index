			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / Malawi troops attack military wing of party At least 16 people were killed when Malawian soldiers stormed into action yesterday to disarm the country's Young Pioneers, the paramilitary wing of the ruling Malawi Congress Party. Troops assaulted the national headquarters and district offices of the Young Pioneers. National offices of the Congress Party were also strafed with gunfire, ransacked and looted by soldiers. Thousands of civilians took to the streets of the capital, Lilongwe, cheering the army. They shouted: 'No more Banda, no more Tembo, no more Chakauamba' - referring to former 'president for life' Dr Hastings Kamuzu Banda and two members of a presidential council that has shared power since Dr Banda's collapse with a stroke in October. The military strike against the Pioneers came after opposition politicians had complained of a delay in disarming the paramilitary group. A call to disarm the 2,000-strong Pioneers came two months ago from a National Consultative Council, comprising government and opposition representatives. The council was charged with overseeing Malawi's transition to democracy following a referendum in June, when Malawians voted to switch to a multi-party system of politics. There has been long-running tension between the Pioneers, the police and the politically neutral army. The government has pleaded the case for integrating the Pioneers into the national security forces. It was not immediately clear how far up the army hierarchy the order to attack originated. The operation began when 200 soldiers assaulted Youth House, the Pioneers' headquarters in Lilongwe. Armed Pioneers initially returned fire but resistance collapsed within minutes. Two army helicopters circled low overhead, apparently in support of the attack. Army units then moved on to the Kamuzu Youth Institute, a training centre for Pioneers, and to urban district offices. The institute was soon ablaze, with civilians braving the fire to loot the premises. Gunfire had died down in the city by late afternoon, although civilian looting of commercial and government premises had begun. At the national headquarters of the Malawi Congress Party, soldiers were systematically removing anything of value.</p>

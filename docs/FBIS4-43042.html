			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Chancellor Helmut Kohl by ZDF reporter </F> Ernst-Dieter Lueg and an unidentified ARD reporter at CDU/CSU  headquarters in Bonn -- live]    [Text] [Lueg] Herr Chancellor, you have said this election  is also of a domestic nature, that it is a trial election. What  is your summary on election night?    [Kohl] I have not used the term trial election. I have  always pointed out that the turnout in the European election is  of necessity quite markedly lower, and that we will quite  certainly have a turnout of 79 to 80 percent in the federal  elections in October. Of course, I am very happy with the result  here tonight. My slogan has proven its truth: We sow the seeds  in April and May, and the harvest comes in summer and autumn.  And that is what has happened. [applause]    [Lueg] Herr Chancellor, the economic situation and  development is good. Was that an advantage for you and your  party in this election, and -- it is a while yet until the  federal elections, but one could perhaps speak of a trial  election?    [Kohl] I would like first to speak about the European  elections, and then about the federal elections. Well, many  people think it is a ritual -- I do not think so. I have walked  a lot of streets and squares and I can only stand here as the  chairman of the CDU [Christian Democratic Union] of Germany,  because I was helped by my political friends in the CDU and the  CSU [Christian Social Union] with great efforts in a massive  election campaign. I thank my friends who helped, and also the  voters. Because if you read the forecasts a couple of weeks  ago, they forecast quite a disaster for today. Now I stand here  with great satisfaction; I am enjoying it, that is my style and  that's why I am pleased.    [ARD reporter] But Herr Chancellor, the showing of the FDP  [Free Democratic Party] cannot be satisfactory for you, for you  are still dependent on the FDP as coalition partner.    [Kohl] Well, first of all, I think this is a European  election. And in the last European elections, the FDP made quite  a tight showing. Anyone who makes predictions tonight for the  October elections with regard to the FDP is certainly quite  wrong. It is quite certain that the FDP will be represented in  the German Lower House in October. I have no doubt about that.  That is something the FDP has seen on many occasions over the  years. And that will happen again this time. I personally am  sorry about this election result, but I say just as clearly that  the FDP is not represented in the European parliament [sentence  as heard]. I am particularly sorry for Frau Uta Wuerfel, who  had an excellent campaign. Why should I not say that on this  occasion? But that is the way things are, and we will work well  with this result within the coalition, looking forward to the  federal elections.    [ARD reporter] I'd like to follow up that question. Are  there those in the FDP who do not support Herr Kinkel's course  of remaining close to the CDU/CSU? Will that not become more  difficult for you. Have you already phoned Herr Kinkel?    [Kohl] No, I have not yet had an opportunity to telephone. I  have been devoting great attention to the election results.  Whoever within the FDP draws the conclusion from this result  that this is a reason to question the coalition -- nobody will  reasonably do this -- will discover very quickly that is just  what the voters will not respect. The voters -- I am firmly  convinced tonight -- will clearly confirm the coalition in  October. For us in the CDU/CSU, at least, today is an important  step toward this development.    [Lueg] Do you see these elections as the voters' assent --  no  matter what party they belong to -- to the Maastricht Treaty?    [Kohl] Yes, I think it is. It is very difficult for an  ordinary person, with the very distant problems which are  concealed within a treaty, to see clearly what it means. But I  believe there is a clear majority in Germany in all democratic  parties that Germany's future can only be assured within the  European Union, that the old Adenauer saying from 1950 is still  valid today: German unity and European unification are two sides  of the same coin. To that extent, I am very pleased with it.    It is more difficult when there is such a distance --  Strasbourg is much farther away -- and there is above all no  European government for or against which one can vote. People  have to change their thinking, and that takes time.    [ARD reporter] If one looks at the former East Germany,  particularly with the local election results, the showing of the  PDS is quite remarkable, irrespective of how one evaluates that.  In many forthcoming state parliament elections, can it be that  only grand coalitions will be able to be formed? Will that not  have repercussions on Bonn?    [Kohl] Well, first I would suggest we do not apply today  this  famous method, understandable among reporters...    [ARD reporter, interrupting] You say we must look to the  future, so let's do that.    [Kohl] ...of predicting the next result, even on the  election  night. I have heard a lot of forecasts from famous journalists  in the last few months, all of which were wrong -- for example,  the prediction that the large parties would fray at the edges,  that the age of the great popular parties is past. There can be  no question of this. There is a groundswell to the large  democratic parties, and even the FDP's result does nothing to  change this, because this groundswell still exists for the FDP.  I am firmly convinced of that.    [Lueg] Why are you so sure that the Free Democrats, who  seemed very depressed on television tonight, will make the  running on 16 October?    [Kohl] For the same reason I have for months been saying the  CDU/CSU will win the elections. CDU/CSU will win the elections.  Everyone thought I was just repeating myself like a clockwork  model running down. The model is very practicable and very  successful. [applause]</p>

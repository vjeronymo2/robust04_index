			<p><P> November 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OPEN HOUSES DEFENDED AS VALUABLE SALES  </P> <P> Weekend poen houses allow potential buyers to "preview" properties at a relaxed  pace while answering the questions, "Do we like this neighborhood and  community?" "Can we afford to buy here?" "Will this suit our lifestyle?" Agents  aren't simply marketing one selelr's home that afternoon, but an entire way of  life.  </P> <P> In this already difficult market, if sellers don't have trust in the real  estate professional's marketing advice and fail to cooperate on open houses,  caravans and short-notice showings, it is tantamount to cutting off one's nose  to spite one's face!  </P> <P> SUSAN HEELEY, Malibu  </P></p>

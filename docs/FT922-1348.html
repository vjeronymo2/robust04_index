			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / Record exports reduce UK trade deficit RECORD exports last month helped to cut Pounds 500m off Britain's visible trade deficit in May, bringing the gap between exports and imports to the lowest level so far this year. But the news failed to help sterling, which closed at the bottom of the European exchange rate mechanism and little changed against the D-Mark and the dollar in London and New York last night. The better-than-expected trade figures also gave no support to equities, which finished sharply lower, as the City reasoned that the reduced deficit represented little more than a return to normal after a poor trade performance in April. The Central Statistical Office reported that the UK's visible trade deficit fell to a seasonally adjusted Pounds 845m in May from Pounds 1.36bn in April after a 4 per cent jump in exports to Pounds 9.17bn last month and a 1.5 per cent drop in imports to Pounds 10bn. It tentatively estimated the UK's surplus from invisible trade such as banking, insurance and tourism was Pounds 200m in May and April, implying a sharp fall in the current account deficit to Pounds 645m last month from Pounds 1.16bn in April. However, the improvements in the trade and current account figures largely reflected an increase in oil exports and a drop in imports of aircraft in May. After stripping out such items, last month's trade performance was broadly in line with that in the nine months to the end of March. While exports last month were a record in terms of value and volume, imports also reached a new high in May in volume terms. The figures were welcomed by the Treasury, which said that May's strong exports were encouraging while the high level of imports was a sign that the economy was recovering. But Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow trade secretary, said that figures for the past year showing imports rising faster than exports were a sign that 'the much promised post-election recovery has simply not materialised'.

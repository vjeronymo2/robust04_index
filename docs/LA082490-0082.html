			<p><P> August 24, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WEEKEND CAR BARRIERS GO UP IN EDGY WESTWOOD  </P> <P> Several Westwood Village business operators said Thursday they are outraged by  city plans to block cars from entering the shopping and entertainment district  on Friday and Saturday nights. Others are cautiously optimistic that the  restrictions will actually help their businesses in the long run.  </P> <P> Many merchants said they believe the plan will cause them financial hardship  but will help curtail the sometimes unruly and rambunctious crowds that gather  on weekend evenings.  </P> <P> "In part, we're the victims of our own popularity," said Don Gimpel, who for 14  years has owned the Bon Appetit restaurant and jazz club in the heart of the  village.  </P> <P> "When crowds get too large and unruly -- and they have been -- people felt  apprehensive and threatened," Gimpel said. "I want people to feel safe when  they come into the village, like it used to be."  </P> <P> Starting tonight, all streets into Westwood Village, including the main artery,  Westwood Boulevard, will be closed to traffic from 7 p.m. until 2 a.m. on  Fridays and Saturdays. City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky said, however, that the  actual closure of Westwood just north of Wilshire Boulevard may occur a little  later because street crews will concentrate on shutting off other intersections  first.  </P> <P> Those who spoke out against the plan in interviews Thursday said they fear it  will strangle commerce in the village and lead to a decline from a once-quaint  enclave into a playground for youngsters -- and sometimes even gang members --  that officials said have been showing up in increasing numbers.  </P> <P> "This is bureaucratic overreaction at its worst," said Shel Starkman, owner of  the Old World restaurant. "It's going to be a ghost town. It will be bereft of  adult clientele."  </P> <P> Most merchants said they were taken by surprise by the city's announcement  shutting the village to vehicle traffic.  </P> <P> Gimpel said he hopes the restrictions will help the village become a place for  people to stroll and shop in an atmosphere akin to that of a European village.  "There is no question it is going to hurt my business -- in the short run we'll  be hurt badly," he said. "In the long run, it'll help."  </P> <P> Starkman disagreed, saying the barricades that currently block weekend traffic  into the area from 9:30 p.m. to midnight are bad enough. He said the new  restrictions will keep out the very people that village merchants hope to  attract.  </P> <P> Fred Clary, area supervisor for Allied/Royal Parking, said that at least one of  the three lots his company operates in the village will be affected, and that  he is dreading the restrictions.  </P> <P> "We can't be happy with not being able to sell the only thing we sell," Clary  said. "This is supposed to be a free country and people are supposed to be able  to go where they want to go if they behave themselves."  </P> <P> Clary, like many other area merchants, expressed frustration at the extent of  the restrictions. "I certainly do agree there are crime problems in the area  and something sure as dickens should be done. But I don't know if blocking the  streets so decent people who want to come can't get in is the answer."  </P> <P> Yaroslavsky, who outlined the plan Thursday at a press conference in the  village, said he is hoping that Westwood will become less congested, with fewer  rowdy crowds, as a result of the ban on vehicles.  </P> <P> Yaroslavsky also stressed that every public parking lot on the perimeter of the  village -- along Glendon, Gayley and Le Conte avenues -- will be accessible.  </P> <P> Visitors to Westwood Village can also park their cars in the lot at the Federal  Building at 11000 Wilshire Blvd., and use the DASH shuttle system that runs  until at least 1 a.m. at a fee of 25 cents per passenger.  </P> <P> The new restrictions come three weeks after a Friday night melee in which  dozens of youths began fighting among themselves, also punching and robbing  some bystanders. Police finally had to declare an "unlawful assembly" and clear  the area, the fourth time they have had to do so in the last year. Nine people  were arrested and three were injured.  </P> <P> The near-riot, as some authorities described it, might have been avoided had  the new restrictions been in place, according to Yaroslavsky and Los Angeles  Police Capt. Michael Bagdonas. Both said that the new restrictions had been  under consideration even before that incident.  </P> <P> "This will help us to better police Westwood," Bagdonas said. "It will cause  criminals to have second thoughts before coming in here."  </P> <P> Bagdonas said the village, and all of Westwood, actually enjoys a low crime  rate, "and we want to make sure it stays that way."  </P> <P> </P> <P> WESTWOOD STREET CLOSURES  </P> <P> Beginning Friday night, street closures will take place at the following  intersections (as shown above) in Westwood Village: Westwood northbound at  Wilshire; Kinross eastbound at Gayley; Broxton southbound at LeCont; Kinross  westbound at Glendon; Weyburn westbound at Glendon; and Westwood southbound at  LeCont. Village patrons may leave their cars in the Federal Building parking  lot at no charge. A shuttle, which charges 25 cents per passenger, will travel  from the Federal Building into Westwood Village on Fridays between 6:30 p.m.  and 1:30 a.m. and on Saturdays from 11 a.m. 1:30 a.m.  </P></p>

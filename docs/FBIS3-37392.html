			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: Reports by </F> Diplomatic Correspondents Dmitriy Voskoboynikov, Igor Porshnev,  Vitaliy Trubetskoy and others]    [Text] Presidents of Russia and Tatarstan Boris Yeltsin and  Mintimer Shaymiyev met in Moscow on Tuesday to sign a power  sharing agreement between Moscow and Kazan.    The agreement delineates the two sides' areas of  responsibility and defines what they must run together.    Speaking at the signing ceremony, Yeltsin and Shaimiyev have  both pointed to the significance of the deal stressing that  political and economic reforms must be based on civic peace,  ethnic harmony and human rights priorities.    The treaty is based on "recognition of each other's  constitutions without encroaching on their substance", Shaymiyev  told Interfax on Monday.    The Tatar leader spoke of the country's need to be  represented in both houses of the Federal Assembly following a  power sharing agreement. "We must get involved in Russian  affairs, defend the republic's interests and pursue an overall  Russian policy to seek the emergence of Russia as a federal  state", he said. (Tatarstan holds elections to the Federal  Assembly on March 13 -- IF).    He said Tatarstan had never insisted on full independence  calling for close bonds with Russia instead.    Shaymiyev says Tatarstan has managed to cushion off the  effects of shock treatment of the economy and somewhat halt  production slump due to the government's economic policy. He  says that despite difficulties, Russia has the chance of turning  into an advanced state if it goes ahead with reforms and makes  less political and economic mistakes.    For his part, Minister for Nationalities and Regional Policy  Sergey Shakhray who drafted the paper described it as "a  substantial breakthrough in the promotion of federal relations".  In an interview with Interfax, he said that "for Russia, a  federal structure is the only way of retaining the country's  integrity and does not amount to a weakening of the state".    He said that neither the federal constitution nor Russian  laws had been effective in Tatarstan for the past three years  adding this could have led to a political crisis if allowed to  persist.    Shakhray says that a new way of preparing documents has  helped towards a success in bilateral talks. "We moved from  concrete agreements to drafting an outline treaty. This helped  not only flesh out the document but also mechanisms of enforcing  it", he said. Shakhray thinks the new method will also enable  to strike a similar deal with the Chechen republic though it  will be different from that signed with Kazan.    The political effect of the treaty is Tatarstan's agreement  to take part in elections to the Federal Assembly "which amounts  to the republic's recognition of the Russian Federation's  sovereignty, laws and constitution", he said.    Shakhray does not rule that other parts of the country may  want to strike similar deals with the center. In his words,  such a process is in line with the federal constitution which  says such treaties can help towards economic and regional  self-adjustment of the federation. Shakhray believes the  Federal Assembly must adopt a law on power sharing as a way of  regulating the process.    In his view, Tatarstan may also join parts of the federal  treaty which coincide with the power sharing agreement signed on  Tuesday.</p>

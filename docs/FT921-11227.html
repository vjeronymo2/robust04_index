			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / Press Review: All roses in Garden City THERE IS an old Hungarian joke: 'This will be an average year. Worse than 1991 but better than 1993.' Sitting in the wings of the Group of Seven finance ministers meeting at the Garden City Hotel, Garden City, Long Island, a week ago, I pondered that line as I heard the Seven reverse it. Everything was getting better. The French minister, Pierre Beregevoy, said: '1992 will be better than 1991.' It all made Le Monde very cross. 'A meeting for nothing?' it asked. 'Will it prove to be totally useless?' The paper concluded by noting that the word 'confidence' had been used five times in the communique but added: 'In highlighting their differences, if not their divergence, the great money men contribute hardly anything to its rebirth.' The Germans took the meeting much more personally. They worry about their high interest rates, which have helped to plunge everybody into recession. Handelsblatt noted with relief: 'Bonn's interest rate policy not in the dock.' Which must have come as a surprise since the Germans had gone into the meeting prepared to square-up to all-comers over this issue. The Bundesbank boss, Helmut Schlesinger, had us reeling at a press conference when he said that high German interest rates were good for everybody. He singled out the little European countries which had followed the German drive for dear money. It was interesting to discover that these countries agreed. Borsen, of Copenhagen, wrote: 'The pressure on Germany to cut interest rates runs like water off a duck's back. This must generate ambivalent feelings among Germany's neighbours, which include Denmark. On the one hand, the weak business climate in Europe screams out for lower interest rates. On the other, no-one wants to risk the newly-won monetary stability. We have to make the best of living with Germany in circumstances we cannot change.' The spectre of industrial unrest and exorbitant wage demands in Germany is not one that most of us can credit. But Bonn is so worried that it lectures the German working class regularly in a manner reminiscent of past British governments. The Sunday edition of the tabloid Bild-Zeitung took up the challenge to the proletariat which constitutes the base of its huge circulation. 'It is time to come to the defence of Germany's workers in the face of ill-targeted criticism . . . to blame high wages alone for the fact that Germany has lost its number one slot in the list of the world's business addresses is simply wrong. In Japan, wages are now almost as high as here. Why, then, have the Japanese overtaken us? Because they are quicker and more flexible and have the courage to take chances.' Where does that leave the rest of us? Garden City was picked for unexpected reasons. The previous meeting in New York State had been at the luxurious Plaza Hotel, by Central Park. So Garden City, an anonymous but wealthy suburb, seemed a bit of a come-down. But it is a mere half an hour from Kennedy airport. There are hotels nearer to Kennedy - airport hotels for example, but David Mulford, of the US Treasury, told me they had names like Howard Johnson or Holiday Inn; and as agreements at such meetings are known by the location (the Plaza and Louvre, for example), none was deemed suitable. Especially as Howard Johnson's is known as HoJo in the vernacular. So far the plan has not worked. None of the papers I have read has written about the Garden City Agreement. It might catch on but, if places now are chosen in order to give a pleasant veneer to the bodged deals at which the Group of Seven normally arrives at, why was Munich chosen for the summit in July?

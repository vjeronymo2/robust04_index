			<p><P> June 22, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> INS CHIEF TO PUSH TOUGHER POLICY ON ALIEN SMUGGLING  </P> <P> The new head of the federal Immigration and Naturalization Service, in a  significant shift in enforcement strategies along the U.S.-Mexico border, said  Thursday that his agency will seek to formally deport or jail smugglers of  illegal aliens and those unauthorized immigrants who repeatedly slip into the  United States.  </P> <P> The planned policy shift, outlined by INS Commissioner Gene McNary at a press  conference here, represents a toughening of the INS's customary practice of  allowing most unauthorized immigrants to return voluntarily to their homeland  soon after capture. Officials have long targeted smugglers, but McNary said  prosecutions would be expanded considerably.  </P> <P> The new get-tough approach was immediately condemned by critics as unworkable,  simplistic and impractical -- particularly in light of the service's shortage  of detention space and personnel, shortcomings that some say leave the agency  impotent to control the huge volume of people who enter the United States  without inspection each day.  </P> <P> At a Los Angeles news conference announcing the new approach, commissioner  McNary was vague about the details of how it will work. He said the program  should act as a deterrent against illegal immigration. He did not elaborate on  when it would begin or or how it might affect an already overworked INS  bureaucracy. But the commissioner, who has been on the job for seven months,  said the step is a necessary one to "regain control of the border," and he  explained later that he would like to see the new policy in place soon.  </P> <P> "Those people who are apprehended will be detained," said McNary, the former  Missouri county executive whose comments Thursday were the most extensive  </P> <P> he has made to date on the border issues that are high on his agenda.  </P> <P> Under the new policy, the commissioner said, repeat offenders and alien  smugglers will be identified and fingerprinted, something the agency does now  only in limited cases. He said repeated offenses will mean jail terms, as  opposed to temporary detention by the INS.  </P> <P> Under current procedures, nearly all captured aliens, most of whom are  Mexicans, declare their wish to return home, sign release forms and, in most  instances, are quickly sent back, usually within three to eight hours.  Immigration experts, including many INS officials, believe the practice --  which is largely a function of the lack of detention space and shortages of  enforcement and court personnel -- encourages aliens to repeatedly try to jump  the border.  </P> <P> "You can't just continue letting them out the back door and think you are  enforcing the law," McNary said in an interview after the news briefing.  </P> <P> Particularly targeted under the get-tough stance, McNary said, would be the San  Diego area, where about 40% of all illegal immigration via the U.S.-Mexico  border is believed to take place.  </P> <P> The Tijuana-San Diego corridor provides the most direct access to the booming  immigrant job markets of Southern California, a region that researchers and  officials say is drawing more and more immigrants -- legal and illegal.  </P> <P> Officials have estimated that about one of every three aliens attempting a  crossing is captured. Last year, agents recorded nearly one million arrests of  illegal immigrants in the United States; 90% were Mexican citizens, most of  whom were quickly dispatched back home.  </P> <P> It was unclear precisely how immigration authorities plan to implement McNary's  new strategy. The policy shift seemingly will require a vast increase in  immigration detention space, but current expansion plans would appear to be far  short of what is needed.  </P> <P> "There's an obvious limitation locally in that we don't have any place to put  them," said Ted Swofford, a spokesman in San Diego for the U.S. Border Patrol,  the INS enforcement arm. The patrol has only 260 detention beds in San Diego,  Swofford said, and those are "always full."  </P> <P> In fact, the INS now only has about 900 beds available in the entire Western  region, which includes all of California, Arizona, Nevada, Hawaii and Guam.  Current expansion plans would bring that number up to 1,400 in the next year or  so.  </P> <P> In the San Diego area alone, however, Border Patrol agents are recording an  average of 1,400 arrests a day during 1990. Most of those detained sign forms  and agree to return to Mexico, usually to attempt to enter anew through the  rugged border terrain.  </P> <P> Several immigrant-rights advocates contacted assailed McNary's proposed shift  in policy, contending that it will be unworkable because of limited detention  capacity and the inability of the federal court system to handle the caseload  that would develop. Moreover, critics pointed out that it is often difficult to  identify and make cases against smugglers and chronic border-jumpers,  particularly since aliens routinely give false names. Authorities only take  fingerprints of about 5% of unauthorized immigrants arrested in San Diego.  </P> <P> "(This) could have major implications in terms of enforcement, overcrowding of  detention facilities, the backlog in the judicial system," said Charles  Wheeler, director of the National Immigration Law Center, a rights group in Los  Angeles. "It's incredibly misguided to think that this will discourage the  majority of people who now come to the United States."  </P> <P> Arnoldo Torres, national political adviser for the League of Latin American  Citizens, wondered whether McNary had contemplated the consequences of his  plan.  </P> <P> "Has he thought about violations of rights in these detention centers?" Torres  asked. "Has he thought about the major problems in the communities where these  facilities will be built?"  </P> <P> In fact, rights activists have long criticized conditions in INS holding  facilities. And opposition from U.S. citizens and others has contributed in the  last two years to the INS decision to back out of two planned new detention  centers, one in Oakland and one in eastern San Diego County.  </P> <P> McNary, during and after the press conference, hinted that plans for greatly  expanded detention space are in the works for the San Diego area. But, although  stressing the need for such facilities, he provided no details.  </P> <P> "Detention is the key to enforcing the law," he said, contending that the  threat of jail is the only way to deter undocumented border crossers.  </P> <P> That view is disputed by immigrant advocates, who say that augmenting detention  capacity will do little to halt the movement of people driven to desperation by  economic and political disruption.  </P> <P> During his Los Angeles news conference, McNary recalled how INS officials,  strapped for detention space, housed 2,500 Central Americans last year in a  makeshift tent city and other facilities in south Texas. However, he stopped  short of endorsing the controversial tent-city approach for San Diego, and  emphasized that the voluntary-return policy will remain in place for the many  unauthorized immigrants who are not arrested for multiple illegal entries onto  U.S. soil.  </P> <P> "We're not going to be able to turn this around overnight," he told reporters.  "But we'll try and identify (alien) smugglers . . . fingerprint them, detain  them."  </P> <P> As part of his overall toughened approach, McNary repeated an earlier vow to  attempt to bolster the uniformed strength of the Border Patrol in the San Diego  by 260 agents, to about 1,000 officers, within a year.  </P> <P> The extra personnel, he said, would be shifted from other duties elsewhere in  the country and would be brought in from among new agents graduating from the  Border Patrol academy in Georgia.  </P> <P> During the news conference, McNary also voiced the hope that the escalating  numbers of robberies and assaults against migrants along the border in San  Diego could be reduced through a variety of methods -- jailing more people for  long periods, installing lights in border zones, posting more border guards,  and improving fences and other barriers. The large groups that now gather daily  along the border contribute to crime and other disruption, McNary said.  </P> <P> "We know that the crowds in the staging areas in San Diego can be dispersed,"  McNary said. "That's not a border problem, that's a humanity problem. . . . It  is a situation that is intolerable."  </P> <P> He expressed particular support for the notion of installing more lights, which  he called "perhaps the best technique in eliminating the violence and the  crowds of people."  </P> <P> However, McNary attempted to distance himself publicly from the huge and  controversial Light Up the Border movement. That San Diego-based group --  criticized by some as a throwback to U.S. nativist movements of the past -- has  attempted to draw attention to illegal immigration by massing along the  international boundary line and shining vehicle headlights southward.  </P> <P> "I think it will probably just run their batteries down," McNary said of the  group's tactic.  </P> <P> But the commissioner acknowledged that the group had galvanized a widespread  perception that the border is "out of control," and, he added, "You don't need  1,000 people putting on their headlights to tell you that."  </P> <P> Later, as part of his first Los Angeles visit to inspect INS facilities, McNary  told a Town Hall luncheon audience that he personally favors a combined point  system and lottery to allow some foreigners with no "family or prospective  employer" connections to lawfully immigrate to the United States.  </P> <P> "All of our skill-based immigration is now employer-driven," he said in  prepared remarks. "I'd like to see someone without that connection have a  chance, too. A person who says, 'I just want to work in America and raise my  family there,' would bring as many benefits to this country as someone with a  much-desired occupational skill."  </P></p>

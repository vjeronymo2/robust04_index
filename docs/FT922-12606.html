			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / Survey of Swindon (6): On the right track - Swindon has achieved a balanced economy SWINDON has successfully diversified its economy away from the railways which for most of this century was the town's biggest employer. After the Second World War, some 14,000 people were employed by Great Western Railways in Swindon. After nationalisation, there was a gradual rundown in operations until 1986-87 when British Rail Engineering Ltd (Brel), the last of the big railway employers in the town, closed down with a loss of 2,000 jobs. Swindon has made good these losses and created new jobs in four broadly defined areas - manufacturing, finan-cial services, distribution and mail order, and electronics. Although Swindon has been trying to limit its reliance on manufacturing, around 26 per cent of the workforce is still involved in this sector. This is higher than the national average of just under 24 per cent, and much higher than the average for the south-east, where some towns have 18 per cent or less of their workforce in manufacturing. Swindon has achieved a genuinely balanced economy. So successful has the diversification been that two years ago companies were concerned about possible labour shortages and the overheating of wages which could follow. Late in 1989 unemployment fell to 2.5 per cent. Even success stories are not immune from the recession. Over the past two years male unemployment has shot up to 9.2 per cent and the female rate to 4.1 per cent. Ms Lorelei Hunt, a senior economic development officer at the borough council, says the high rates are due to two factors: the slump in construction work, and the decisions by the big financial services groups not to take on new staff. She says: 'For most of the 1980s Swindon was like one big building site. Now, if you walk around the town you would be pushed to find one crane operating. 'Once building activity picks up it will quickly make a hole in the unemployment figures.' As for female unemploy-ment, the large financial services groups such as Allied Dunbar and Nationwide expanded constantly throughout the 1980s. Many of the people they took on were mothers returning to work, school-leavers, or even part-time employees. The female unemployment figure therefore represents a new jobless pool that did not exist before the economic expansion of the 1980s. It is not just the construction industry and the female workers joining dole queues for the first time that has swelled the numbers of people unemployed. Many manufacturing companies have slimmed down and shed workers.</p>

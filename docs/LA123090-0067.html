			<p><P> December 30, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SPECIAL REPORT;  </P> <P> THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA;  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA'S PRESENT;  </P> <P> THE FOOLISH TREND THAT STARTED ON THE EAST COAST;  </P> <P> ECONOMY: HAND-WRINGERS AND CRYSTAL-BALLERS HAVE EMBRACED CALIFORNIA DECLINISM.  BUT THEIR FAVORITE EVIDENCE IS REALLY A HEALTHY SIGN OF A STATE MOVING TO CUT  ITS DEPENDENCY ON WAR.  </P> <P> Is California losing its luster as the beacon of the nation's economic and  technological future? Some national business publications -- Forbes, Fortune  and the Wall Street Journal -- have laid out the case for a new phenomenon,  "California declinism." Angst over the future has also surfaced in the state's  traditionally more upbeat academic, corporate, governmental and media  Establishment.  </P> <P> True, there is cause for concern. The continuing slowdown in military spending,  the economic effects of the Persian Gulf crisis, the global credit crunch and  resulting housing slump, all have braked the fast-growth pace of the mid- and  late 1980s.  </P> <P> Yet despite these problems, California's economic fundamentals remain  remarkably strong.  </P> <P> Indeed, what the "decliners" see as harbingers of an economic fall are really  signs of a healthy long-term transition from dependency on the warfare state to  a more highly diversified economy with expansive global links. The region is  well-positioned to emerge in the 1990s as among the most dynamic in the  advanced industrial world.  </P> <P> The enormous vitality of this evolving California economy is evident even amid  the pain and wreckage of the current recession. Despite some slowing, virtually  all California's vital signs -- from exports and job creation to gross state  product -- remain healthier than those of the nation. The real-estate market,  though drastically down from its recent boom levels, does not appear poised for  the "meltdown" now hitting the Northeastern states and sections of the Midwest.  </P> <P> One critical factor is the state's population growth. During the 1980s,  California's population grew by more than 26%, an increase of more than 6  million people. By contrast, New York's population rose by less than 3%, or a  total of 486,433 people.  </P> <P> This steady increase has helped keep California's net absorption of office  space -- the supply of which has doubled in Southern California during the past  decade -- among the highest in the nation. Next year, even much-maligned Los  Angeles, now overbuilt with largely Japanese-financed projects, will lead all  the nation's cities in new office-space acquisition, according to a recent  Cushman and Wakefield survey.  </P> <P> "The Northeast's perception that we're ready for a fall doesn't understand that  we are still absorbing people and creating jobs, while both (those indices) are  now negative in places like Massachusetts and Connecticut," says Jerry Jordan,  chief economist for First Interstate Bank. "As long as you have net growth and  people coming in, the buildings should keep filling up, even if it takes more  time."  </P> <P> Jordan's optimism about the state's ability to churn out more jobs flies in the  face of widespread hand-wringing over the impact of military cutbacks. By some  pre-gulf crisis estimates, less Pentagon spending could wipe out as many as  140,000 of the 350,000 new aerospace jobs added in California during the 1980s.  </P> <P> The UCLA Forecasting Project, perhaps the most frequently quoted local voice of  "California declinism," predicts the state could soon be hit by a deep-seated  recession similar to the one it experienced in the early 1970s. Then,  California lost 25% of its aerospace jobs, and total employment, as well as  real-estate values, plummeted.  </P> <P> Such gloom and doom, barring a worldwide economic catastrophe, is unlikely.  Since the late 1960s, California's dependency on military spending has been cut  in half, to roughly 8% of state product. Meantime, the commercial portion of  the aerospace business -- dead in the water during the 1970s -- continues to  grow. Last year, for instance, Boeing alone contracted some $3 billion in  components from Southern California businesses.  </P> <P> Despite the military-related cutbacks, California -- which in the 1980s created  more new jobs than all of Western Europe -- generated more than 400,000 net new  jobs in 1989. Together, San Bernardino and Riverside put more people to work  than the New York and Boston areas combined. Although industrial employment has  been slipping, this may simply be an effect of the emerging national and global  recession. In the coming decade, Robert Dye, director of state forecasting for  the WEFA Group in Bala Cynwyd, Pa., predicts that "California will continue to  outperform the United States in industrial output."  </P> <P> Another favorite chant from the "California decliners" mantra is based on  reports of a mass exodus of California companies to other states. True, some  firms have relocated or expanded into such lower-cost states as Utah, Texas,  Colorado, Oklahoma, even Baja California. This was the centerpiece of Forbes'  hit piece on the state, titled "California's Fading Boom."  </P> <P> This and similar articles, however, ignore a basic fact: the decreasing  importance of corporate relocation decisions. Today, most new jobs -- including  in the critical manufacturing and high-tech sectors -- are created by locally  owned small firms.  </P> <P> A recent study by the Center for the New West of California and other Western  metropolitan areas found that, during the late 1980s, locally owned firms  generated all net manufacturing jobs and as many as 10 times many new jobs in  such areas as business services.  </P> <P> Equally important -- although some California companies will migrate in search  of less expensive labor, cheaper land and fewer environmental restrictions --  the state is unlikely to lose out in sectors like time-sensitive fashion and  technological products.  </P> <P> Rather than a sign of decline, the shift of some assembly and lower-end  functions to the hinterlands represents the continued expansion of the coastal  California economy. In some senses, it parallels the shift earlier this century  of assembly and mass-production industries from the Atlantic Coast to the  Middle West and South.  </P> <P> This movement will cause dislocation for industries that are both  labor-intensive and low value-added or pose severe pollution problems.  </P> <P> Value-added refers to the amount of cash added at each stage of the economic  process. Low valued-added means that relatively little of the final cost of a  product is added at a particular stage of the process. For instance, cables  assembled for a General Dynamics aircraft at a plant in Mexico may represent a  shift of jobs but very little of the final product's total value. The effects  in terms of pollution will be particularly severe in such industries as  furniture, chemicals and certain metal-related manufacturing.  </P> <P> These losses can be offset with the growth of other more advanced industries.  With more engineers and scientists than any other two states combined, for  instance, California's key growing industries -- computer systems, software and  telecommunications products -- should continue to grow well into the next  decade.  </P> <P> Paced by Orange County and Silicon Valley, for instance, the value of  California's export licenses surged, between 1987 and 1989, from roughly $30  billion to nearly $35 billion. During that time, exports in mid-Atlantic states  dropped to $14.1 billion. U.S. television exports, mostly from Hollywood, will  more than double by 1992, according to estimates from Frost and Sullivan, to  nearly $3 billion annually.  </P> <P> Finally, as the industrial power of the region stretching from the Inland  Empire of California to the Rockies -- as well as Baja California -- increases  during the 1990s, Southern California and the San Francisco Bay Area will enjoy  great opportunities in meeting its financial, international trade and other  business-service needs. With the decline of the New York money-center banks,  this is even more the case now than in the '80s, when California bank assets  grew twice as quickly as those of their Gotham rivals.  </P> <P> But the pushers of "California declinism" don't rest their predictions merely  on economics.  </P> <P> UCLA's School of Architecture and Urban Planning has been building the case for  the idea of Los Angeles as the "capital of the Third World." Here and in other  parts of the state, there is a widespread impression that massive foreign  immigration is being accompanied by a swelling exodus of middle-class whites to  other states.  </P> <P> Belief in this scenario is widespread, if largely unspoken, in California's  elite ranks. One top official of the Southern California Association of  Governments recently complained that most newcomers to his region were  "uneducated Latinos" unsuited for our developing high-tech economy.  </P> <P> Immigration, particularly illegal, does pose long-term employment and social  problems. But stories of a mass walkout are far off the mark.  </P> <P> In 1989, about as many people "immigrated" to the state from the rest of the  country as from the rest of the planet. Among the leading net exporters of  people were many of the states crowing loudest about the exodus of skilled  professionals and businesses from California -- including Minnesota, Texas,  Colorado and Washington State. The latter sent three times as many emigrants  here as Californians moved there. Utah, the state Fortune described as the best  place for finding employees in America, sent almost 4,000 more people to  California than vice versa.  </P> <P> California, then, still enjoys, nationally and abroad, widespread appeal as a  place to live and work. Unfortunately, the state's leadership, compared with  past eras, lacks a common vision that could inspire California to tap its  latent energies.  </P> <P> In the 1990s, California must go beyond the approach of the George Deukmejian  years, when planning didn't go much beyond building prisons and, whenever  possible, expanding the executioner's franchise.  </P> <P> Perhaps more than anything else, we need to return to the enlightened activism  practiced by turn-of-the-century Republican Progressives and the Democratic  administration of Edmund G. (Pat) Brown.  </P> <P> Instead of playing the politics of racial division and class warfare, these  leaders focused on creating the transportation and education infrastructure  that allowed previous generations of newcomers achieve their own dreams.  </P> <P> Rather than mimicking the deepening malaise of the East Coast, California  should strive to recover the spirit that built it -- "can-do" optimism. A  revival of that spirit is our best hope of extending the California dream for  the next generation.  </P></p>

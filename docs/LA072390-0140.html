			<p><P> July 23, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ELBOW SURGERY FOR SABERHAGEN DEEMED A SUCCESS  </P> <P> Two-time Cy Young winner Bret Saberhagen underwent successful arthroscopic  surgery on his right elbow today, the Kansas City Royals announced.  </P> <P> Dr. Steven Joyce removed two loose fragments and reported that no ligament,  tendon or nerve tissue was disturbed, the Royals said.  </P> <P> "I hope to be back pitching in September," Saberhagen, a right-hander, said on  Sunday. "Nobody has ever told me of any reason why I can't shoot for that  target."  </P> <P> Saberhagen is 5-7 with a 3.10 ERA in 18 starts this year. He left his last  start, on July 15 against Boston, after only four innings.  </P> <P> Team officials said Saberhagen is expected to begin throwing in three to five  weeks.  </P> <P> Saberhagen won the American League Cy Young last year after going 23-6 with a  2.16 ERA. He also won the award in 1985 when he was 20-6, 2.87.  </P> <P> His 1990 troubles have followed the inexplicable odd-even cycle of Saberhagen's  career. In odd-numbered years since reaching the major leagues in 1984,  Saberhagen has gone 20-6, 18-10 and 23-6. His records in even-numbered years  are 10-11, 7-12, 14-16 and 5-7.  </P></p>

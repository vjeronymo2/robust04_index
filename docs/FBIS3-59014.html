That is the crux of the bill Netherlander Justice  Minister Hirsch Ballin and State Secretary Kosto submitted to  the second Chamber on Thursday [20 January]. Under this bill,  the justice minister can designate certain countries of origin  as being safe countries.    Safe countries must be countries where there is no fear of  persecution in the sense of the Geneva Convention on Refugees.  Nigeria and Russia come to mind. An asylum-seeker from such a  country can have his application for admittance as a refugee  immediately rejected as unfounded.    Under this bill, an application from such an asylum-seeker  will only be considered if he can establish circumstances which  depart from the general situation in the country of origin and  which arouse suspicions that he does indeed have grounds to fear  persecution.    According to Hirsch Ballin and Kosto, the proposed  regulation  is very similar to the change in asylum legislation that Germany  passed on 1 July 1993.    With this regulation, Hirsch Ballin and Kosto want to  prevent  refugees from applying for political asylum in countries with  the most favorable legislation. For drawing up the list of  safe countries, justice officials will consult with the Foreign  Affairs Minister. They do not, however, recognize the  usefulness of an advice obligation by the advisory committee on  refugee affairs in designating safe countries. The Council of  State had left this up to Hirsch Ballin and Kosto to consider.    The country of origin is legally defined as the country  where  a refugee is "born and bred."    The Refugee Foundation was not available for comment on  Thursday. Earlier the organization had raised strong objections  to the idea of safe countries because as a result, refugees are  more at the mercy of their own region, where the relief and  asylum procedures are worse than in the Netherlands for example.</p>

			<p><P> November 6, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY COLLEGE NOTEBOOK;  </P> <P> TRIP BACK IN TIME HAS GIVEN EBERHART A NEW PERSPECTIVE  </P> <P> Joli Eberhart got a new perspective on herself as a volleyball player this  summer, but it took a time warp of sorts for it to happen.  </P> <P> Eberhart, an outside hitter for Golden West College, spent part of her summer  coaching a group of seventh-graders for the Orange County Volleyball Club.  </P> <P> Her charges were flighty at times, and didn't always realize why their coach  asked them to do things in a particular fashion. They also reminded her of  herself a few years ago.  </P> <P> "It made me understand how come coaches ask you to do things certain ways,"  said Eberhart, 20.  </P> <P> She spent the remainder of her summer working harder than ever for the upcoming  season. And things have gone very well for Eberhart and the Rustlers.  </P> <P> Golden West (14-1, 9-0 in conference) is a victory away from clinching the  Orange Empire Conference title, and Eberhart has led the way.  </P> <P> She was voted the most valuable player of the Santa Barbara Tournament of  Champions, one of the most competitive tournaments in the state.  </P> <P> "She always worked hard," Golden West Coach Al Gasparian said. "Now she is just  better focused."  </P> <P> For Eberhart, mention of the word "focused" brings a smile.  </P> <P> "That's the word," she said. "Maybe I'm getting a little more serious. Before,  I would be a little spacey, but coaching this summer did me a lot of good. I  see things a lot better."  </P> <P> Eberhart, 5 feet 7, also found inspiration from first-year assistant Nancy  Hillman, who is also 5-7. Hillman was a four-year starter for USC at outside  hitter, a position usually played by women three to four inches taller.  </P> <P> But Eberhart has risen above her competition because of her keen desire and  powerful legs. She realized she wasn't going to be 5-10 or so when she was a  freshman at Mater Dei High School, so she devoted time to working on her leg  strength. But having Hillman at practice each day also gave her great  incentive.  </P> <P> "It gets me going," Eberhart said of Hillman. "Just seeing her hit on the other  side of the net, I get motivated, especially because she is my size."  </P> <P> Eberhart came to Golden West after turning down a scholarship to Idaho State.  She also was recruited by Chapman out of high school. Arizona showed an  interest in her after last season, but she opted to stay at Golden West.  </P> <P> She is currently being recruited by several colleges, including St. Mary's,  Loyola Marymount and Iowa.  </P> <P> The ever-evolving Orange Empire Conference men's soccer race developed into a  tie Monday, thanks to action on and off the field.  </P> <P> Orange Coast, the defending state champion, and Irvine Valley, in its first  year in the league, are tied for first place with 19 points each. Both have  8-1-3 records.  </P> <P> Irvine Valley was a point back after Friday's games, but picked it up thanks to  a forfeit from Cypress. Cypress announced Monday it had to forfeit four  victories and two ties, including one to Irvine Valley, because one of its  players violated the state athletic code by playing on a club team during the  college season.  </P> <P> The announcement came six days after Rancho Santiago, which was tied for first  place last Monday, had to forfeit 14 victories and two ties for having two  players who also played with a club team. OCC and Irvine Valley picked up  forfeit victories from Rancho Santiago.  </P> <P> Rancho Santiago since has disbanded its team for the season's final two  matches. OCC plays at San Bernardino Valley today and at Cypress Friday. Irvine  Valley plays today at Fullerton and will finish Friday with a forfeit victory  over Rancho Santiago.  </P> <P> The top two teams from the conference advance to the playoffs. Fullerton  (7-3-2) is in third place with 16 points.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Albanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] [Announcer] Albanian President Sali Berisha signed  the Partnership for Peace [PFP] initiative in Brussels today.  First he met NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner. For more  details, we go over to a telephone report by Aida Shehu.    [Shehu] The participants in the meeting expressed a common  concern over the situation in the Balkan region and noted that  the attention of the international community is concentrated on  Bosnia at a time when it is evident that the problem of Kosova  is a key problem, and that without resolving it there can be no  solution to the regional crisis. The participants also  expressed concern over the division of Bosnia because, it was  said, this division favors the aggressor and creates premises to  set up new states through force.    The meeting also focused on the increasing expansion of the  relations between Albania and NATO, as represented by the  signing of the PFP initiative.    The Woerner-Berisha meeting lasted for about 30 minutes. In  the presence of the North Atlantic Council, President Berisha  gave a speech before signing the PFP agreement. After  expressing his thanks to the North Atlantic Alliance for the  invitation to our country to cooperate as a partner, Berisha  stressed that he was confident that the decision to further  cooperation with the former communist European countries taken  at the NATO summit in January this year constitutes a historic  step in the life of our continent and the whole international  community. NATO is now the only military alliance in our part  of the world that, because of its moral values and military  potential, has the indisputable responsibility for peace,  security, and European stability. NATO is today the only great  hope to cure Europe and the international community from the  Bosnian (?penitent) syndrome.    President Berisha later stressed that as a country fully  interested in stable peace in the region, we should stress that  in the last 20 months developments at the military level,  together with the many defeats of the negotiations, clearly  testify that dividing Bosnia is a hopeless option to end the war  and establish peace, and that the time may have come to replace  it with another option that respects the principles of  preserving Bosnia's integrity, the right of the people to return  to their centuries-long hearths, and does not reward the  aggressor. President Berisha said that though the defense of  these principles seems difficult at first sight, he thought that  this was the only way to establish peace and that it was many  times more productive than the acceptance and implementation of  contrary principles.    President Berisha reminded those present that one of the  great knots of the present Balkan crisis is undoubtedly the  problem of Kosova. There should be no solution to the Balkan  crisis without solving the Kosova issue. That is why Berisha  asked them that this question, which could at any moment trigger  a Balkan war, be accorded the proper gravity and the dimensions  that it possesses. For this reason, he said, I consider it very  important to link the sanctions on Serbia to the situation  created by Serbia in Kosova, to dispatch UN monitors to the  province, and to exert pressure on Serbia so as to start  negotiations with the legitimate representatives of this  province within the framework of the Geneva conference, as well  as to make a clear inventory for the return of all the violently  seized institutions and to solve its status by respecting the  human and national rights of 2 million Albanians who live in  their ancient territories.    President of the Republic of Albania Sali Berisha signed the  PFP agreement at 1045 in the presence of the North Atlantic  Council members.</p>

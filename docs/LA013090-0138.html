			<p><P> January 30, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: SCIENCE/TECHNOLOGY  </P> <P> Marketing Agreement: Despite the troubles it has experienced over the past  several years, IBM still can give a big lift to small companies. Network  Software Associates of Laguna Hills, which specializes in designing software  for the complex computer networks used by IBM's biggest customers, has signed a  marketing agreement with Big Blue that it hopes will boost sales.  </P> <P> Network Software already works closely with IBM, as it must to sell the  specialized networks that allow IBM personal computers and terminals to "talk"  with larger minicomputers and huge mainframes. And the 10-year-old, privately  held firm has made a good business of it, building up to a staff of 50.  </P> <P> Now, the company will be an official "industrial application remarketer" for  certain IBM products. And though the agreement won't have a huge impact on the  way the firm does business, "having the IBM logo next to yours ensures an image  of strength in the customer's mind," a company spokeswoman said.

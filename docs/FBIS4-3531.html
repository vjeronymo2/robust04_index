			<p>BFN     [Text] Brussels, April 21 (XINHUA) -- The European  Community (EC) today declared that it "always supports" the  resumption of China's status in the General Agreement on Tariffs  and Trade (GATT).    The statement was made in a press release issued after a  meeting between Christiane Scrivener, the EC commissioner for  tariff affairs, and Gu Yongjiang, vice minister of the Chinese  foreign trade and economic cooperation.    During their meeting on Wednesday, Scrivener and Gu mainly  exchanged views on China's re-entry into GATT.    China, one of the founding parties of the world trade body,  withdrew from it in 1949 and applied for re-entry in 1986.    Scrivener told Gu that Chinese membership in GATT is "the  way  China must take toward a greater participation in the world  trade wave."    Therefore, the EC commissioner said, EC will support, as it  always does, China's application for membership.    However, she stressed that China needs to make "very clear  commitments" to meet some "specific conditions" put forth by  GATT before the re-entry.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Sejm Deputy Jerzy Jaskiernia, chairman of </F> the Sejm Legislative Commission, by Henryk Sroczynski; place and  date not given]    [Text] [Sroczynski] The question of the president's  powers is probably one of the most important, and at the same  time most controversial, issues in the work on the new  constitution....    [Jaskiernia] Indeed, the question of the president's rights  is a key issue and is certain to generate many arguments.  Different functions are attached to the office of president in  different systems. In a presidential system of the kind  obtaining in the United States, the president discharges the  function of head of the executive power--that is, he actually  directs the government. On the other hand, in the  parliamentary-cabinet system, the president is more a symbolic  head of state. His function is to carry out certain ceremonial  duties and grant top academic and other titles and highest  military ranks; he is also the supreme commander of the armed  forces. The Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] opts for the latter  model.    [Sroczynski] What motivates the Left to make this choice?    [Jaskiernia] We postulate a weaker position for the  president because we see the government and the prime minister  as the principal carriers of the executive power. In our  opinion, the public should know precisely who governs the  country: the president or the prime minister.    [Sroczynski] Have we not known that hitherto?    [Jaskiernia] For the past few years, we have had a situation  in Poland whereby the president could say that he was not able  to realize his election campaign promises because he does not  have sufficient powers as a result of the government's  intervention. The government, in turn, claims that it cannot  discharge its obligation to administer the country because the  president interferes in various areas of its competence.    [Sroczynski] As a result, you are proposing to introduce a  classical system of a combined parliament-cabinet rule, in which  the president's function will be more symbolic than real.    [Jaskiernia] We adopt the classical configuration in which  the president's function is weaker, but we also allow for a  certain reinforcement of that function. First, we assume that  the president will be elected by the whole of society in a  general ballot. We have chosen that option, even though it is  not strictly necessary with the president's current range of  competence. Second, we allow for a more active role to be played  by the president in a conflict situation--that is, at a time  when we are unable to form a government. This should give him a  chance to become a mediator.    [Sroczynski] Only in that kind of situation?    [Jaskiernia] I believe that, as soon as conflicts of that  sort cease occurring, the president ought to withdraw into the  wings and leave the stage to the government, giving it full  freedom to act. Why should the president be an obstacle to the  government's discharging its administrative duties?    [Sroczynski] Does Lech Walesa's personality not influence  the left's decisions on which powers to give to the president?    [Jaskiernia] We are trying to draft a new constitution that  is free from "personality conditioning." In other words, as we  formulate the constitution, we leave out the question of Lech  Walesa's personality. Furthermore, we have never discussed the  president's range of competence with the aim of weakening his  position. Anyone who watches the results of public-opinion  polls will know that the ranking list is headed by SLD candidate  Aleksander Kwasniewski. So it is not altogether certain who  will be elected the next president. We believe that the public  should have a clear-cut picture of who is responsible for the  state administration. Personally, I am a firm opponent of a  twofold, or diarchic, power structure. To apply soccer-derived  vocabulary to such a structure, you can say that it is easiest  to place the ball between the goalposts when there are two  defense players. This situation of "splitting the defense" is  most characteristic of a system where the president has a  considerable range of competence, parallel, as it were, to the  government's competences. In the FRG, there is no doubt that  the chancellor is responsible for the state administration. In  Britain, everyone knows that the prime minister runs the  country's affairs, and no one expects the queen to do so. Why  should we opt for a system that causes constant confusion about  who is in charge?    [Sroczynski] Because the question of the range of  competence of our top political figures and institutions  generates such controversies and conflicts, is there not a  danger that it will also delay the work on drafting the new  constitution?    [Jaskiernia] If both sides show goodwill, the constitution  could be promulgated in May or June of next year. The procedure  approved by the Sejm for adopting a constitution is of a very  democratic nature. Unfortunately, this creates the opportunity  for delaying the work at every stage--and, if someone wished to  do so for some malicious reason, he could well succeed. Such a  boycott, based on exploiting various procedural loopholes, gaps,  and opportunities, could cause a considerable delay in the work  on the constitution and even lead to a situation whereby its  promulgation by the present parliament is in question.    [Sroczynski] Is your vision not unduly pessimistic?    [Jaskiernia] Perhaps it is, but the possibility of such a  situation cannot be precluded.    [Sroczynski] What other surprises do you think there could  be?    [Jaskiernia] I also allow for the possibility of a certain  paradoxical situation, which some people are already predicting.  It is obvious that the president's representative on the  Constitutional Commission will opt for a strong position for the  president. In turn, the Center Accord [PC] will attempt to  minimize the president's role in its own preferred version of  the constitution. It is already clear that the division line  will be quite complex. It is not only the left-wing orientation  that opts for a weaker position for the president.  Consequently, there is some speculation that, having realized  that he has no reasonable chance of being elected within the  framework of a strong presidential power system, Lech Walesa  could still change his mind and pronounce himself in favor of  the weaker presidential power option.    [Sroczynski] Do you mean that this could be the lesson we  might yet learn from the outcome of the settlements reached  during the roundtable talks?    [Jaskiernia] It may be that it will be necessary to abandon  certain positions in order to avoid falling again into the trap  into which Lech Walesa fell precisely during the roundtable  negotiations. At that time, he was in favor of weak powers for  the president because that office was then set aside for General  Wojciech Jaruzelski. Later, after a short period of General  Jaruzelski's presidency, he assumed that position himself, with  its restricted powers, and immediately began to complain that  his range of competence was too restricted. If he had taken a  long-term view during the roundtable talks, he would have had no  reason for complaint. On the other hand, we distance ourselves  from making tactical, person-oriented moves, and, while we do  not attempt to adjust the proposed presidential powers to the  personality of any particular candidate, we nevertheless intend  to build the state system according to logical and reasonable  principles.</p>

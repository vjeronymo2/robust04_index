			<p>921005 FT  05 OCT 92 / Deployment of Japanese to troops to Cambodia speeded up JAPAN'S troop deployment in Cambodia speeded up at the weekend with 160 more soldiers joining the peace mission. This is the first overseas task for Japanese ground forces since Japan's surrender in 1945 and follows the signing into law of its peace-keeping operations bill in June after 20 months' bitter debate. The engineer units and eight military observers join 15,000 soldiers from 30 countries wearing UN blue berets in Cambodia. They will monitor a ceasefire, disarm rival armies and supervise elections next May. The main body of Japanese troops arrives on October 13.</p>

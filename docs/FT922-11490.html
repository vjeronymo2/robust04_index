			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / Patten faced with need to rebuild colony's confidence MR CHRIS Patten, who will arrive in Hong Kong as governor with less than five years to go before the colony reverts to Chinese sovereignty, will discover that it has regained much of the confidence lost following the 1989 Beijing massacre. But even setting aside the broad issue of relations with China before the transfer, some pressing near-term difficulties will await his attention. Mr Patten will be keen to meet Lu Ping, China's director for Hong Kong affairs, and try to defuse a row with China over the colony's broadcaster, RTHK, which the government wants to give corporate status. The UK has been accused in the Chinese media of seeking to make RTHK independent so the network can serve British interests after 1997. Although the economy is performing strongly, the present administration has lost key supporters in the business community. The new governor must convince businessmen he is able to safeguard their interests. Important contracts for the new airport are pending and must go ahead smoothly while inflation must be further addressed. Government plans to increase imports of labour will be attacked by trade unions and will lead to continued tension. One simmering dispute which will have to be addressed this year is Hong Kong's proposed court of final appeal, which will replace the Privy Council. The structure of the court has been agreed between Britain and China, but Hong Kong is unhappy it was not consulted on the decision. Mr Patten will have to decide whether to push ahead with legislation on the court early next year, and anger Hong Kong, or anger China by asking for renegotiation. Other likely arguments stemming from the work of the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group include the future of military lands and air service agreements between Hong Kong and third countries. Morale must be restored among the 186,000-strong civil service, which no longer sees the traditional rewards of colonial office - such as British honours - as so desirable. The service also needs to become more politically aware now it is being challenged by democratically elected politicians, and to increase links with China. Police morale is also low, and violent crime is on the rise.</p>

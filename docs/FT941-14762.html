			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / Cleveland to be replaced by four unitary councils Cleveland County Council is to be abolished and replaced by four all-purpose unitary authorities, Mr John Gummer, environment secretary, announced yesterday. Local businesses reacted furiously to the move, which is the first formal decision to be made by the government on restructuring a mainland county since the review of English local government structure was announced by Mr Michael Heseltine, then environment secretary, in 1991. Mr Gummer said the new structure would 'bring the benefits of unitary local authorities to Cleveland: better service delivery, more efficient and effective local government and - most importantly - one door to knock on, making the council as accountable as possible to local people'. Sir Ian Wrigglesworth, northern region chairman of the Confederation of British Industry, said: 'Businesses won't have to knock on one door, but on three council doors in the Teesside conurbation, and the doors of quite a number of joint organisations which will run services across the whole Teesside area.' Ratepayers, he said, would have to pay the bill for a less efficient system than could have been put in place. The CBI has lobbied for three districts to be merged to form a Teesside unitary council, with Hartlepool left as an independent unitary authority. The leaders of all three political parties on Cleveland County Council renewed their call for Teessiders to 'rise up in protest' at an 'impending disaster'. The announcement was welcomed by the four Cleveland district councils. The option chosen by Mr Gummer is in line with the recommendation by Sir John Banham, chairman of the Local Government Commission. Cleveland County Council has already applied for judicial review of Sir John's recommendations, claiming they are 'ill-considered, unwanted and expensive'.</p>

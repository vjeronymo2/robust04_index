			<p>Language: <F P=105>Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Following a special meeting of the Slovak Government  headed by Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar, at 1100 in Bratislava  today, the Government of the Slovak Republic terminated its  work. Vladimir Meciar briefed newsmen about this development at  a news conference at the end of the government meeting today.  He went on to say that none of the members of his cabinet will  accept the request of President of the Republic Michal Kovac to  head their ministries until a new government is appointed.    In this connection, Vladimir Meciar emphasized that what is  at issue is not a political position, but the situation that  results from the constitution which does not prescribe the  sequence of ministerial moves in the event that a vote of no  confidence in the prime minister is passed.    Based on the government's resolution passed at its meeting  today, from 18 March the prime minister is recalling all state  secretaries and heads of departments of individual ministries  from their posts.    According to Vladimir Meciar, those members of his cabinet  who are not members of the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia  [HZDS], agreed with the government's resolution concerning the  refusal to temporarily carry out ministerial functions until the  new government is appointed. These are: Economy Minister Jan  Ducky, Interior Minister Jozef Tuchyna, and Defense Minister  Imrich Andrejcak. While the first two are returning to their  initial posts--Jan Ducky will be the president of the  Association of Industry of the Slovak Republic, and General  Tuchyna is returning to active military service--General  Andrejcak said that he is joining the HZDS as a protest against  political practices.    Of the three members of the coalition government from the  Slovak National Party, the former deputy prime ministers Jozef  Prokes and Marian Andel are returning to the parliament as  deputies and Jaroslav Paska, who was minister of education and  science, is said to be going back to his initial job as higher  education lecturer.    Vladimir Meciar acquainted journalists with the contents of  the two letters he received from the president of the republic  today. In the first letter, Michal Kovac asks him, as the  chairman of movement with the largest number of seats in  parliament, to nominate a representative whom the president can  delegate to begin negotiating about the composition of the new  government. If Meciar fails to do it by 1700, the president  will consider his request to have been refused.    Vladimir Meciar is determined to answer the letter in  writing, adding that he has already expressed his rejection in  public. He also remarked that it is unusual for the president  to negotiate with chairmen of other political parties while  inviting chairman of the parliamentary group to represent the  Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS]. Vladimir Meciar said  it is offensive to the whole movement.    Addressing the president, he also said that Michal Kovac was  publicly dishonest toward the HZDS in his speech in the National  Council and on several other occasions. He will therefore  negotiate with him only if the president apologizes. Vladimir  Meciar continued: The president who does not speak truth before  the National Council should leave his post. It is his duty.  Meciar added that the moment a new government is formed, he  will consider it the president's moral duty to resign.    In the second letter, the president of the republic recalled  Vladimir Meciar from the post of prime minister and abolished  his duty to temporarily run the Ministry for the Administration  and Privatization of National Property. At the same time, he  recalled him from the post of chairman of the State Defense  Council. At the same time, he thanked him for the work he had  done in these posts.    Vladimir Meciar announced that as from today he is returning  to parliament as a deputy. Together with him, former ministers  Olga Keltosova [minister of labor, social affairs, and the  family] and Katarina Tothova [minister of justice] will join the  National Council's plenum.    Vladimir Meciar said that the government is not disbanded.  From today, it has begun to work as a shadow cabinet.</p>

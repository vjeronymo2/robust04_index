			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 31 (AFP)--China denied Thursday that  it was blocking UN efforts to solve the North Korean nuclear  standoff, while reiterating its firm opposition to a binding  Security Council resolution on the issue. "There is no question  of being uncooperative," said Foreign Ministry spokesman Wu  Jianmin, who touted China's preference for a "moderately-worded"  presidential council statement as the best step towards a  peaceful resolution of the Korean crisis. "We stand for a  moderately worded, constructive presidential Security Council  statement that is designed to facilitate the parties concerned  ... to resume dialogue on this question," Wu said. "This is a  well-considered position," he added.    His remarks came after China split with the rest of the  council members Wednesday over the form and substance of a  warning to North Korea over its suspected nuclear bomb  programme. Western powers, especially the United States, have  pushed hard for a binding resolution that would promise further  action--a thinly veiled reference to possible economic  sanctions--against North Korea over its failure to give  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors access to  all its nuclear facilities.    Exerting pressure on Pyongyang "can only deteriorate the  atmosphere and aggravate the problem," Wu stressed. "Therefore  we do not accept a Security Council resolution," he said, adding  that China's insistence on a presidential statement "represents  an effort to facilitate the resumption of dialogue." Wu, who  declined to specify whether China would veto any UN resolution,  called on the parties concerned "to demonstrate patience and  cool-headedness" given the potential threat to regional  stability posed by the volatile situation on the Korean  peninsula.    China's rejection of a binding resolution effectively  scotched plans for a Security Council warning to be issued to  North Korea late Thursday, as non-aligned council member states  called for more time to reach a consensus on a message that  could receive unanimous support.</p>

			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / People: Transfer Technology recruits Bill Hayden Transfer Technology, the fast-growing specialist engineering company headed by Labour MP Geoffrey Robinson, has recruited Bill Hayden (right) to the board as its third non-executive director. Rhys Williams, chairman of the council at the University of Warwick and until recently a director of GEC, has also been co-opted to the board. Hayden, the former Ford of Europe manufacturing director, spent his last two years before retirement as chairman and chief executive of Jaguar, famously comparing factory conditions at Ford's new prestige acquisition to plants he had seen in Gorky. Robinson is perfectly familiar with Jaguar, having been chief executive at just 35 in the mid 1970's when he remembers luring away a number of Hayden's key men. As it is, Ford is by far TransTec's biggest customer on the car components side, buying 75 per cent of the company's manufacturing output for the automotive industry. A principal reason for hiring Hayden, who lives just 20 minutes away from the TransTec's Coventry office, is his knowledge of the Japanese market and his ability to deal with Japanese car makers, according to finance director Neil Logue. A leading authority on Japanese work practices, Hayden was the author of a paper 'BJ AJ' - Before Japan, After Japan - written after a seminal visit to the country in 1979. At a time when it was still notably difficult for foreigners to divine much about Japanese manufacturing techniques, Hayden had come back 'shaken' by the competitive gulf between Europe and Japan, and resolved dramatically to improve Ford's efficiency. Robinson has said that he will split the role of chairman and chief executive at some point during the next 18 months. 'All the non-executive directors are possible chairmen' says Logue 'but Hayden would fit the bill very well.' Hayden is also on the board of automotive design engineer Hawtal Whiting.</p>

			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Standard Life Standard Life is cutting interim bonus rates for 1994 on with-profits endowment policies and unitised with-profits policies. The company said lower interest rates had reduced its expectations of future returns on its investments. Values of longer-term policies maturing this year are slightly higher, due to good investment returns over the life of the policy, but payouts on shorter term policies have been reduced. The value of a 25 year with-profits endowment maturing this month, taken out by a man aged 29, is Pounds 63,832, up 0.7 per cent from last year, while a 10-year policy would pay Pounds 6,472, down 5.4 per cent.</p>

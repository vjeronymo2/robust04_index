			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / Survey of New Zealand (6): Year-round holiday venue - Queenstown / Hub of New Zealand's tourist industry QUEENSTOWN, a township nestled at the foot of the sheer cliffs of a South Island alpine range known simply as The Remarkables, is New Zealand's most popular tourist destination. It is estimated that around 750,000 of the million overseas visitors who came to New Zealand last year spent at least a day at the resort - and most spent three days there. Despite the numbers, it is possible not to be aware of fellow tourists in this most unusual destination, as I found during a fortnight visit with my family at the height of the summer vacation this year. The reasons are simple: Queenstown is the centrepiece of a leading holiday region, with an amazing variety of attractions. Most American, Australian or European visitors 'disappear' there for the day in rental or hire cars. From Queenstown, there are short drives to deserted gold mining towns, around Lake Wakatipu, or further afield to lakes such as Wanaka or Te Anau which are preferred by the local people as they offer better boating and fishing. For the more adventurous, the Fiordland National Park is a 12-hour day trip, although others go by luxury coach, or take a 20-minute flight to Milford Sound. Milford in turn offers jet boating to the open sea, bush-walks and a three-day tramp over rugged terrain to Lake Te Anau. Known as the Milford Track, this is one of New Zealand's leading outdoor attractions. Queenstown is a genuine year-round holiday centre: in the winter months, three of the country's top ski fields are within a 20-minute drive. All summer sports facilities are available. Two excellent local vineyards produce award winning wines. Each claims to be the most southerly vineyard in the southern hemisphere, and the wines are distinctive and pleasant. Other small vineyards flourish throughout the region, and visitors are encouraged to go on a day long wine trail. The Earnslaw, said to be the oldest coal-fired passenger steamer still afloat has the distinction of being launched on the same day as the Titanic. It sails regularly to high country 'runs' (the local name for sheep farms), where it berths, and passengers are encouraged to dine at the homesteads. For the more active, a former Queenstown resident - and now millionaire - A J Hackett, offers bungy-jumping from the historic Kawerau Bridge into swirling waters of the ravine below. There is also year-round white water rafting, para-gliding, jet boat rides on the turbulent waters of the Shotover and Kawerau Rivers, safari trips and helicopter rides. Queenstown is bubbling with confidence about its future as the hub of New Zealand's tourist industry. This is leading to a mini-construction boom: and the sleepy town of the 1960s and 1970s, is now host to 60 competitively priced and surprisingly good restaurants.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Own Information" report carried as part of "Military </F> Review" feature under the general heading "Everything Changes in  the Army. Except the Defense Minister's Birthday":"Spare a Word  for the Poor 'Glavpur' [Main Political Directorate]"]    [Text] The Defense Ministry collegium has made another  decision on another reorganization of the Main Directorate for  Work with Personnel, the now former the Main Military-Political  Directorate of the Soviet Army and the Navy. Veteran political  workers will remember that this is either the fourth or the  fifth "purge" of the once indivisible ranks of ideologists and  propagandists. The names, structures, and staffs have changed  but the department itself has remained, albeit with fewer  people. Everyone criticized it except the lazy ones: a "bastion  of stagnation," a "hotbed of deception," and so forth. But in  the crackle of newspaper crossfire it seemed to have been  forgotten that there is no other organization capable of taking  care of the education of soldiers and sailors. There was much  talk about military chaplains but for some reason priests,  mullahs, and rabbis did not appear in the barracks.    "The army is outside politics" -- that was the main slogan  of  recent years. But can that be said today after the events of 4  October and the elections? Some observers, albeit highly  cautious ones, connect the latest "purge" of the "Glavpur" with  the elections in particular. In Russia's political elite people  believe that the Army made a weighty contribution to Vladimir  Volfovich [Zhirinovskiy]'s victory. But it voted for the new  Constitution, too, didn't it?    Be that as it may, it is now being said that the  directorate's staffs will be reduced by two-thirds leaving fewer  than 50 people in the new structure. What will the trade-off  be? For the moment there is none. The Armed Forces will  finally be outside politics and at the same time outside  education.</p>

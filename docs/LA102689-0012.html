			<p><P> October 26, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COPING WITH ANXIETY FROM THE QUAKE;  </P> <P> MENTAL HEALTH: SAN FRANCISCO'S DEVASTING TEMBLOR RAISED EMOTIONAL AFTERSHOCKS  -- IN THE REST OF THE NATION AS WELL AS IN CALIFORNIA.  </P> <P>  The San Francisco earthquake was disturbing -- and not just for Californians.  We have seen several patients in our practice in the last few days because of  anxiety precipitated by the quake.  </P> <P> In addition, many of my patients have become significantly more anxious and  depressed since the disaster, which killed so many and devastated the lives of  thousands. I was initially amazed as to how important discussion of the  California quake was to my patients. What was even more puzzling was that their  focus on this event continued rather than diminished as the days went by.  </P> <P> I polled several practitioners and they reported similar reactions with their  patients. Interested to see if this was limited to people who were already in  therapy, I asked several of my friends and family to informally monitor and  report back to me what they observed with their friends and associates.  Although far from qualifying as a scientific survey, their reports were  unanimous: about 25% of the people they observed seemed to have a higher level  of anxiety and depression associated with the California earthquake. What is  the basis for their anxiety -- particularly in Baltimore, Md., 3,000 miles from  the disaster?  </P> <P> Perceived control over our lives is the most important factor which predicts  our emotional and physical health as well as our longevity. Most of us spend  the majority of our energy to secure what we want and need and to increase the  predictability of life. When we feel that our control over day-to-day existence  is reduced, our anxiety and fear grow proportionately.  </P> <P> But worldwide disasters are commonplace. All we have to do any day of the week  is turn on the TV and there we have it -- instant disaster. So why should the  California temblor shake us to our foundation and create so many emotional  aftershocks, including increased anxiety, panic attacks, insomnia and  depression, and physical problems, such as headaches, gastrointestinal distress  and fatigue? There appear to be several conditions that came together to reduce  our sense of perceived control over our lives to extremely low levels and, in  turn, resulted in severe and continued reactions to the earthquake.  </P> <P> First, within the month preceding the quake we had Hurricane Hugo. Each night,  we tracked the hurricane on the evening news. At the onset we saw it east of  Puerto Rico, and then each day we carefully plotted its course. We knew exactly  where it was, what islands were in its path, how large it was, and how strong  were its winds. Yet in spite of all that information, we watched on television  while it destroyed the life's work of tens of thousands of people in South  Carolina. We had complete information and yet were helpless -- totally lacking  control over preventing its disastrous consequences.  </P> <P> In addition, because of instantaneous reporting on television, our capacity to  closely identify with the people who were devastated was heightened to levels  beyond that which we normally experience. This unique combination of "seeing it  coming" and being unable to "stop it" increased our sense of helplessness and  fear.  </P> <P> With the devastation of Hugo still fresh in memory, along comes the earthquake.  Not in Tibet or Peru, but on home territory, in San Francisco, a city most  Americans associate with the height of civilization and sophistication.  </P> <P> So the one-two punch of Hugo and the quake has caused the nation's anxiety to  soar.  </P> <P> But why doesn't everyone experience problems? And what can we do about it if we  are suffering such upset?  </P> <P> We all have, whether we realize it or not, what I call a "sense-of-control  quotient." Some of us feel more in control of our lives than do others. For  example, at one end of the continuum of perceived control is the person who,  after falling out of an airplane without a parachute, is relatively confident  that he will be able to hit the ground in such a fashion as to minimize his  injuries. At the other end is the individual who, while seemingly secure in his  cozy living room, is anxiety-ridden over the possibility of an out-of-control  airplane crashing into his house. Fortunately, most of us reside somewhere in  between these two extremes.  </P> <P> However, where we reside appears to be the result of two factors. The first is  subtle and often hard-to-identify learned behaviors in our childhood that, at  critical times in our development, teach us how much control we "perceive"  having over our lives. I must emphasize that what we grow to expect in terms of  control over our life and how much control we actually have are not necessarily  related. Some of us grow up expecting to rule the world and others grow up with  a desire to dig a hole and hide, no matter what our life's experiences.  </P> <P> In addition to our childhood experiences are those in our adult life. If we  have been plagued by events such as losing our job unexpectedly, our spouse  running away with the next-door neighbor, the unexpected and untimely death of  a loved one, a chronic illness -- these combine with our learned expectations  from childhood to produce a particular "sense of control quotient." The lower  our quotient, the more susceptible we are to developing emotional and physical  problems from events like Hugo and the earthquake.  </P> <P> So what can we do to enhance our quotient and to reduce our distress?  </P> <P> First, we can use our intelligence like a tool to reshape our emotional  reactions. Understanding the meaning and implications of the serenity "prayer"  can be a major first step in this regard. "God give me the strength to change  the things I can, the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, and the  wisdom to know the difference."  </P> <P> We spend so much of our emotional energy focusing upon that which we cannot  change that we have none left to expend on those circumstances that we could  alter. As a result of not taking charge over that which we can control -- we  feel even more out of control and our "quotient" drops even lower.  </P> <P> Although most of us have experienced tragic events in our lives that have been  totally outside of our control, in fact these account for a very small  percentage of events and situations in our lives. In spite of this fact, so  many people spend so much of their time worrying about things they can't change  and do little to shape the outcome of their own lives.  </P></p>

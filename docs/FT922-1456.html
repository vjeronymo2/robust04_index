			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / Tilbury ferry faces royal displeasure THE OPERATORS of one of the oldest ferry services in Europe have been told to cease services or face the Crown's displeasure. Ferries linking Essex and Kent across the Thames have operated continuously since 1086. But lawyers acting for the Crown now say the service must stop because it 'is a breach of our client's rights'. The Crown Estate, which owns and purchases land and property on behalf of the Queen, has demanded an immediate suspension of crossings between Tilbury and Gravesend, currently operated by White Horse Ferries. White Horse has decided to defy the order and continue services for the 250,000 passengers who use the crossing each year. The company, which is upgrading the route as part of its plans to operate long-haul ferries into London, said it purchased rights to the crossing last year when it bought the route from Sealink-Stena, the ferry operator. The Crown Estate, however, claimed Sealink-Stena's route licence was non-transferable and said it should not have been sold. 'We've told them to cease operations. They don't have a licence as far as we're concerned,' it added. The Crown claims White Horse has the right to carry passengers in one direction only, from Gravesend to Tilbury, but not back again. River licences from Tilbury are issued at the discretion of the sovereign, who inherited them in the 15th century. Mr Peter Lay, joint chief executive of White Horse, fears that the Crown Estate, which saw the value of its property fall by more than 12 per cent in 1990, is trying to extract a high price for a new Tilbury licence. 'Their motives are financial. They want to hold us to ransom,' he said yesterday. The Crown Estate declined to comment on the possible costs of a new licence but hoped talks could resolve the dispute before services are suspended.</p>

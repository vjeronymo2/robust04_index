			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From MAINICHI SHIMBUN 11 January Evening Edition] </F>   [Text] On 11 January the Ministry of Post and  Telecommunications [MPT] began preparations for establishing  broadcasting stations which will provide programs only in  foreign languages. MPT's Broadcasting Bureau Chief Masaaki  Egawa said: "Tokyo is the only major city in the world which has  no radio station providing foreign language programs." In light  of this, the MPT will create conditions for approving the  establishment of new broadcasting stations to live up to the  name of the international city "Tokyo." If technical issues  such as allocation of electric waves are solved, it is likely  the establishment of foreign language FM stations will be  authorized within the year.    In concrete terms, FM stations will be newly established to  provide programs only in English. Although it is planned that  such stations will be newly established in three major cities --  Tokyo, Osaka, and Nagoya -- it is expected an FM station will be  established only in Tokyo at first. The MPT will first study  technical issues as to whether there will be electric waves  which could be allocated for a new station. Then it will begin  to work out a basic broadcasting program to improve system  conditions.    What is behind the issue of setting up broadcasting stations  for foreign language programs is that with the progress of  internationalization, the number of foreigners who visit or live  in Japan are increasing every year. Statistics show 980,000  foreigners stayed in Japan for more than 90 days in 1989. In  1993 the number increased to 1,370,000. The number of  foreigners who visited Japan sharply increased to 3.53 million  people (in 1991) from 2.15 million (in 1987). In light of this,  those associated with the broadcasting business have expressed  hope that broadcasting stations intended for foreigners will be  established. Moreover, some felt that broadcasting in foreign  languages is necessary in view of emergency cases such as  disasters.</p>

			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / Gaza bombing: over 150 held Palestinian police arrested more than 150 Islamic Jihad activists in the Gaza Strip over the weekend following Friday's suicide bombing outside a settlement in the Gaza Strip which killed three Israeli reserve officers. Israel's prime minister, Mr Yitzhak Rabin, continued, however, to press the Palestinian Authority to act more rigorously to prevent such attacks on Israeli soldiers and civilians by fundamentalist groups opposed to the peace agreement. Those arrested included a brother of the Islamic Jihad leader, Sheikh Abdallah al-Shami. But most of the organisation's senior figures are reported to have gone into hiding. After an earlier suicide bombing in which 22 passengers were killed on a Tel Aviv bus last month, the Palestinian police arrested hundreds of activists, but soon released them all without charge.</p>

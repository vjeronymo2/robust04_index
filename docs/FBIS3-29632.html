			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 22 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa said Tuesday [22 February] he has told his top aides to  look into the possibility of an alliance of five  intraparliamentary groups within the House of Representatives to  counter the largest opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP).    Reacting to a front-page article in the Tuesday morning  edition of a major daily, the MAINICHI SHIMBUN, he told  reporters he discussed the matter with top aides in his Japan  New Party [JNP].    The MAINICHI said that Hosokawa gave the instruction earlier  this month in a bid to eventually unite his JNP with Sakigake  (Harbinger), Shinseito, Komeito, the Social Democratic Party  (SDP) and the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP).    The premier is seeking a pre-election alliance of the five  intraparliamentary groups to win a majority in the next general  elections for the lower house, which will feature a new  electoral system with 300 single-seat constituencies and 200  seats chosen by proportional representation, the daily said.    JNP and Sakigake currently maintain an intraparliamentary  group within the lower house.    Hosokawa's fresh proposal marks a departure from his  previous  desire to see a multiparty system in Japan and signals his  inclination to have a two-party system, which is also favored by  Shinseito and Komeito, the MAINICHI said.    But the proposal runs counter to the views of Sakigake  leader  and Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, who favors a  coalition of Sakigake and the liberal segments of the LDP, SDP  and DSP by distancing itself from Shinseito and Soka  Gakkai-backed Komeito.    Takemura, reportedly under pressure from Hosokawa and  Shinseito co-leader Ichiro Ozawa to quit the key cabinet post,  predicted last weekend that three or four major parties will  compete in the next general elections, which may be held in the  fall of 1995.    Takemura opposed Hosokawa's five-party alliance plan and  said  at a news conference that it is "imperialistic" and  "expansionist."</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Other commenters were concerned that a new institution would not be able to make substantive changes in curriculum to keep up with new technology and changes in industry and marketplace requirements. One commenter explained that other Federal agencies may have regulations that affect course content and length and suggested that if the Secretary retained language prohibiting institutions from changing courses substantially in content and length, the provision be revised to allow for course content and length changes necessitated by regulations of other Federal agencies. Another commenter was concerned that a new institution would never be able to change its courses. Other commenters suggested that accrediting agencies and State Postsecondary Review Entities (SPREs) would monitor program integrity and quality and a shorter period than two years could be used.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As the Secretary indicated in the preamble to the NPRM, the purpose behind this provision is to prevent an institution from offering a minimal program during the first two years of its existence and then expanding its programs when it becomes eligible to participate in the title IV, HEA programs. The Secretary believes that the best way to support this purpose is to require an institution to offer over the two-year period a training program that is substantially the same in terms of subject matter and length as the training program it offers when it applies for institutional eligibility. However, the Secretary agrees with the point made by some commenters that some flexibility should be provided with regard to the subject matter of a program to take into account new technology and requirements of other Federal agencies. The Secretary does not agree with the suggestion that an institution should be able to make substantive changes in the subject matter of a program because of changes in market conditions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary considers programs to be substantially the same if they are listed within the same generic series and codes defined in Chapter I, Academic and Occupationally Specific Programs, published by the Secretary in the Classification of Instructional Programs, Second Edition (1990).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary considers a program to be substantially the same in terms of length as the program the institution is currently offering if the program offered over the two-year period would qualify the applicant to be an eligible proprietary institution of higher education or eligible postsecondary vocational institution. Thus, in general, the program must provide at least 20 weeks of instructional time and at least  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 16 semester hours, 24 quarter hours, or 600 clock hours.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary will permit an institution to demonstrate that the subject matter of its program changed substantially over the two-year period because of new technology or the requirements of other Federal agencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A number of commenters suggested that the institutional portions of programs, such as the Federal SEOG and Federal Perkins programs, should not be included in the numerator since the money comes from the institution and not the Federal Government.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary agrees. An institution should not include institutional matching funds in the numerator as part of its title IV, HEA program funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A number of commenters discussed the presumption that title IV, HEA program funds are used to satisfy tuition, fees and other institutional charges unless these charges were satisfied with grant funds provided by sources independent of the institution. Commenters suggested that the above presumption should not apply if the tuition, fees and other institutional charges were satisfied with money provided by other Federal agencies, such as the Department of Veterans Affairs, or through job training contracts under Federal, State, or local training programs, such as the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary agrees with the commenters with regard to funds received by an institution under a job training contract under Federal, State, or local training programs since the Congress in the Higher Education Technical Amendments of 1993 provided for an exception to the ability to benefit (ATB) enrollment limitation for institutions serving ATB students under such contracts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 600.5(d)(2)(v) has been amended to allow an institution to consider that a student's tuition, fees and other institutional charges were satisfied from funds provided under contracts described in &sect;600.7(d).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A number of commenters suggested that the definition of ``revenue'' in the denominator used in &sect;600.5(d)(1) is too narrow and should be expanded.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As indicated in the preamble to the NPRM, the Secretary believes the definition of the term ``revenue'' establishes a reasonable middle ground between counting only the income received from students' tuition and fees and counting as revenue income from businesses that are owned and operated by the institution, regardless of the relationship between the educational institution and the businesses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A number of commenters suggested that revenue from contract training (on or off-site) provided by the institution to business and industry be included as revenue in the denominator in &sect;600.5(d)(1) since this type of training is directly related to the curriculum offered by the institution.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> An institution can count as revenue only tuition, fees, and institutional charges for students enrolled in eligible programs at the institution, and funds received for activities that are necessary to the education or training of those students enrolled in eligible programs. Therefore, whether an institution can count as revenue in the denominator of the fraction in &sect;600.5(d)(1) the revenue described by the commenters depends on whether an institution's contract training programs qualify as eligible programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

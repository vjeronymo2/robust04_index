			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, March 31 (AFP)--Israel and PLO put the final  touches to a security agreement for the West Bank town of Hebron  on Thursday before a scheduled signing ceremony, PLO spokesman  Usamah Sharab said.    Israeli deputy chief of staff, General Amnon Shahaq, and PLO  chief negotiator Nabil Sha'th were to sign the agreement.    "The two delegations are giving the text a final going  over,"  he said.    Both sides had asked for slight changes to be made, a source  close to the negotiators said.    The accord calls for the deployment of 160 international  observers in Hebron, where a Jewish settler killed 30  Palestinian worshippers on February 25.</p>

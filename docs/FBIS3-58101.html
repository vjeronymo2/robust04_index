			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Stuttgart (DDP/ADN) -- Economic Affairs Minister  Guenter Rexrodt (FDP) [Free Democratic Party] has criticized his  CDU/CSU [Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union]  partners in the Bonn coalition in unusually severe terms.  Speaking at the Epiphany meeting of the Free Democrats in  Stuttgart on Thursday [6 January], Rexrodt said that the Union  is, like the SPD, "torn by internal divisions, blind in its  populism, and incapable of taking unconventional decisions."  Thus the CDU wants to "outdo the Social Democrats in the  politics of redistribution of wealth."    Rexrodt added that the Union has "become paralyzed,  cautious,  anxious, and preoccupied with its different wings." The FDP has  the unique opportunity "to put itself at the head of the  movement which is fighting for the renewal of our economic and  social order." Prosperity for all cannot be guaranteed with the  traditional recipes. What is needed is a return to classical  liberal ideas of a state based on the rule of law, market  economy, and social responsibility. [passage omitted]</p>

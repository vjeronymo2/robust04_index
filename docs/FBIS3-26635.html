Qian Qichen, member of the CPC Central Committee Political  Bureau and vice premier of the State Council, attended today's  tea party and extended cordial greetings to all State Council  counselors and Central Research Institute of Culture staff on  behalf of the State Council.    In his speech, Vice Premier Qian Qichen said in the  soon-to-be-elapsed Chinese calendar year, the entire party and  the people of all nationalities in the nation have, under the  guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism  with Chinese characteristics and the party basic line, seized  the opportunity, deepened reform, and made solid efforts in  realizing the establishment of a socialist market economic  system. In the past year, China achieved rapid economic growth;  the market thrived; the standard of living level improved;  society enjoyed stability; people of all nationalities showed  solidarity; various social undertakings achieved new progress;  the anticorruption struggle led by the CPC Central Committee and  the State Council, which won the hearts and minds of the people,  scored initial results; diplomatic work showed marked results,  creating a more advantageous international environment for our  country's economic construction. We are also pleased to know  that the multiparty cooperation and political consultative  system, under CPC leadership, has been further consolidated and  that the party's united front work has been constantly  strengthened. Members of the Communist Party and various  democratic parties and patriots without party affiliation  showing utter devotion to one other, sharing weal and woe, and  joining in discussing national affairs have become an important  feature in building socialism with Chinese characteristics.    The coming Chinese new year will be particularly crucial for  building our country's socialist market economy as a number of  major reform measures will be introduced that year. It is  necessary to continuously give play to the political superiority  of the united front work in the new period, to mobilize all  positive factors, seize the opportunity, deepen reform, open up  wider, and accelerate the pace of building the socialist market  economic system.    Qian Qichen said that in the past year, the state counselors  conducted a massive number of investigations and  enthusiastically advanced proposals on government work, to which  leading comrades of the CPC Central Committee, the State  Council, and relevant departments attached great importance.  Central Research Institute of Culture and History staff members  worked diligently and achieved marked results in various social  and cultural undertakings. In addition, Central Research  Institute of Culture and History counselors and staff members  also established ties with various overseas circles, forged  friendships with them, and contributed to economic and cultural  exchanges between China and overseas areas and to the great  cause of reunification.    At the tea party, State Council Counselors Office and  Central  Research Institute of Culture and History representatives  reviewed their work in the past year and expressed their wishes  to continue contributing to socialist modernization construction  and to the building of spiritual and material civilizations with  their knowledge and special skills.    Other leading comrades who attended today's tea party  included: Cheng Siyuan, vice chairman of the National People's  Congress Standing Committee; Luo Gan, state councillor and  secretary general of the State Council; and Hu Sheng, vice  chairman of the national committee of the Chinese People's  Political Consultative Conference.    Wan Shaofen, deputy head of the CPC Central Committee United  Front Work Department, presided over today's tea party.    Responsible people from the relevant CPC Central Committee  and State Council departments as well as dozens of Central  Research Institute of Culture and History counselors and staff  members attended today's tea party.</p>

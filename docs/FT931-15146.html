			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / VW approves DM76bn spending programme in spite of recession VOLKSWAGEN, Europe's leading carmaker, is to press ahead with a heavy investment programme in spite of the recession. The group's supervisory board yesterday approved a five-year spending plan that will inject almost DM76bn (Pounds 31bn) into the business by the end of 1997. More than half, DM45.3bn, will be spent on the vehicles business, while the rest will further bolster the group's leasing and sales financing arm, estimated to have a 20 per cent share of the German leasing market alone. An earlier expenditure programme for 1992-96 had earmarked DM51bn for investment in vehicles. A statement published after the meeting, the first under the guidance of Mr Ferdinand Piech, group chairman since January 1, said adjustments were in the light of the current economic situation. All projects were under review, it added. However, present difficulties appear to have damped only modestly the group's plans, which include construction of a DM4.3bn plant in Mosel, a new works in China and expansion of the Seat and Skoda subsidiaries. Spending in vehicles divisions in this financial year will fall below DM9bn, compared with DM9.9bn last time, the company said, but rise later to average more than DM9m a year. There was no mention of further job cuts or other economies, widely expected after Volkswagen's slump into loss in the fourth quarter of last year, warnings of a dividend cut, and company forecasts of a 20 per cent fall in domestic demand for cars this year. The group, which employs 273,000 worldwide, cut almost 7,000 jobs last year, pruned planned investment spending by DM3bn, and imposed extensive short-time working at the turn of the year. The likelihood of a further 30,000 job cuts by the end of next year, as suggested in some reports, is still unclear. The supervisory board also appointed Mr Martin Poth, personnel director, to a newly created role as board member responsible for the Asia-Pacific region. Volkswagen shares closed down DM4.40 at DM258.50 in Frankfurt before the outcome of yesterday's meeting was known.</p>

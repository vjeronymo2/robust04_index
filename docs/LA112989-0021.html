			<p><P> November 29, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: POP MUSIC / THOMAS K. ARNOLD: A LOT OF GOOD SOUNDS GO  UNNOTICED IN SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> Let's take a moment to spotlight some of the San Diego pop music scene's  best-kept secrets -- weekly events that are musically enriching but generally  draw sparse crowds because of a lack of exposure:  </P> <P> * The "Sunday Night Blues Jam" at Winston's Beach Club in Ocean Beach. Close  your eyes and pretend you're in some Kansas City roadhouse. Up to a dozen local  blues musicians engage in a spirited free-for-all, tearing up the house with  sizzling interpretations of classics like "Little Red Rooster," "Mannish Boy"  and "The Thrill is Gone."  </P> <P> * Jack Tempchin's Monday night gigs at the Casbah in Middletown. Accompanying  himself on guitar, the local singer-songwriter performs mostly originals, many  of which you're bound to recognize. Among them: "Peaceful Easy Feeling" and  "Already Gone," big hits for the Eagles in the early 1970s; "Slow Dancing," a  minor hit in 1976 for Tempchin and his own band, the Funky Kings, and a major  smash a year later for Johnny Rivers; and several more recent chart-busters  Tempchin penned for ex-Eagle Glenn Frey, including "Smuggler's Blues," "You  Belong to the City," and "I Found Somebody."  </P> <P> Alternating sets with Tempchin are two other local singer-songwriters: country  traditionalist Robert Savery and Candye Kane, sure to evoke memories of the  late Patsy Cline.  </P> <P> * Tom (Cat) Courtney's Thursday-night appearances at the Texas Teahouse in  Ocean Beach. The veteran bluesman has been playing at this tiny beach-area dive  for 17 years. Before that, he toured and recorded with such blues legends as  Lightnin' Hopkins, T-Bone Walker and Jimmy Reed.  </P> <P> Courtney consistently refuses offers to play elsewhere on other nights. He's  got a full-time job -- as fry cook at the Stardust Hotel and Country Club in  Mission Valley, working the graveyard shift.  </P> <P> * Open Mike Night, every Tuesday at the Spirit in Bay Park. Local wanna-be's  take the stage and perform a song or two; alumni include punk-rock bands, folk  groups and even a country fiddler. "We've also had comedians, jugglers, and  poets -- anybody off the street who thinks they have something to offer," said  Spirit owner Jerry Herrera. "It doesn't matter how good they are; it all turns  into fun."  </P> <P> * The Wednesday night "Original Music Showcase" at Rio's in Loma Portal. Three  or four local bands are featured each week, performing hourlong sets of their  own material. Talent coordinator Buddy Blue doesn't care whether they play  punk-rock, heavy metal, reggae or whatever else -- just as long as they don't  do any (ugh!) covers.  </P> <P> Tonight's appearance at Winston's Beach Club by the recently resurrected Iron  Butterfly is something of a homecoming. The much-maligned heavy metal  progenitors, best remembered for the 1968 mega-hit, "In-a-Gadda-Da-Vida," began  life in San Diego two years earlier as the Palace Pages, the house band at the  long-defunct Palace nightclub on Frontier Street (now Sports Arena Boulevard).  </P> <P> Jerry Herrera, who owned the Palace (and who now owns another club, the  Spirit), remembers them well.  </P> <P> "When I hired them, they were a soul-psychedelic band," he said. "They took the  old soul sound from, say, Otis Redding and James Brown, and then added the  freaky psychedelic music, with lots of feedback, that was just starting to get  popular up in San Francisco."  </P> <P> For more than a year, Herrera added, the Palace Pages continued in that vein,  cultivating an interracial following that routinely packed the place, night  after night.  </P> <P> "They appealed as much to blacks as they did to whites," Herrera recalled.  "And, let me tell you, they really sounded good -- they combined the best of  rhythm-and-blues with the best of psychedelic rock 'n' roll."  </P> <P> The Palace Pages' metamorphosis into what Lillian Roxon's Rock Encyclopedia  calls "the original heavy metal Cro-Magnons" came after they moved to Los  Angeles in 1967 and changed their name to Iron Butterfly, Herrera said.  </P> <P> "I think after they left San Diego, they sort of became part of the scene that  was happening up there," he said. "They got into a completely different groove  and just fell into it."  </P> <P> This stylistic change may have put Iron Butterfly on the fast track to  commercial success, but Herrera didn't like it.  </P> <P> "When I heard their (second) album, I was really disappointed," he recalled.  "It made them really big, but the music wasn't very good at all. I knew they  were capable of doing so much more."  </P> <P> LINER NOTES: Club of Rome, one of San Diego's most promising original-music  bands, will perform a two-hour concert of acoustic and experimental music  Saturday night at the Sonic Arts Gallery downtown. The band will play acoustic  versions of the six songs on its recently released debut album, "New World  Coming," as well as new tunes reflecting chief songwriter Steve Saint's growing  interest in ethnomusicology. Band members will be backed by an assortment of  guest musicians, including a flutist, a sitarist and a tabla player. . . .  </P> <P> The Dec. 14 heavy metal concert by Badlands and D.A.D. has been moved from the  Bacchanal in Kearny Mesa to Iguanas in Tijuana. . . .  </P> <P> Exactly 22 years ago this week, San Diego pop quintet Gary Puckett and the  Union Gap made their first-ever appearance on Billboard's Hot 100 singles chart  with "Woman, Woman." . . .  </P> <P> Best concert bets for the coming week: Former X singer Exene Cervenka and the  Walking Wounded, tonight at the Belly Up Tavern in Solana Beach; the Blasters,  Thursday at the Belly Up; Spirit, Friday at Winston's Beach Club; the Meat  Puppets, also Friday, at San Diego State University's Backdoor; Third World,  Saturday at the California Theater downtown, and Ronnie Montrose, also  Saturday, at the Bacchanal.  </P></p>

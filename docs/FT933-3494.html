			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / Tokyo split over moves to cut surplus DIFFERENCES have emerged in Tokyo's new coalition government over whether to accept US demands for numerically targeted cuts in Japan's swollen current account surplus. Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the prime minister, said yesterday that he would study the issue of targets, but added that it would be difficult to set goals for the surplus. He was responding to remarks in Washington at the weekend by Mr Tsutomu Hata, foreign minister, that Japan might consider specific targets for cutting the surplus with the US. This seemed a reversal of previous policy on Japan's most important trade relationship. Senior officials yesterday stressed there was no change in stance. However, internal pressure for change is building up, with parts of the foreign ministry keen to offer a compromise on this sensitive dispute when Mr Hosokawa meets President Bill Clinton in New York at the end of the month. There has been a chorus of calls recently from business leaders such as Mr Takeshi Nagano, president of the Nikkeiren employers' federation, for the government to discuss such targets. They fear Japan's opposition to a targeted cut is a factor in the yen's 20 per cent rise against the dollar since January, which has made worse an already serious corporate profits downturn. Japan has so far successfully resisted US demands for a reduction in the current account surplus to less than 2 per cent of gross domestic product over three to four years. The surplus hit Dollars 117.55bn, or 3.2 per cent of GDP last year and is heading for 4 per cent of GDP this year. August trade figures, due out today, are expected to confirm this trend. The toughest opposition to trade targets comes from the finance and international trade and industry ministries. They argue that they cannot hope to hit such targets, even if agreed, because their influence over Japan's increasingly free economy is declining. Unofficially, they see targets as an unacceptable encroachment on what power they have left to carry out economic and industrial intervention.</p>

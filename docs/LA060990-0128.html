			<p><P> June 9, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA;  </P> <P> IT TOOK TLC TO SAVE NEIGHBORHOOD TREES  </P> <P> Residents who live along Cabrillo Park Drive learned this week that it is  possible to fight City Hall -- and win.  </P> <P> Most of the 132 liquidambar trees that line both sides of their street were  once only weeks away from being removed because their massive roots were  causing extensive damage to sidewalks. But the trees have been saved as a  result of the protest staged by hundreds of residents who claimed that removing  the liquidambars would destroy their neighborhood and lower property values.  </P> <P> Residents started a petition drive, spoke out at City Council meetings and  formed the 400-member Trees Living on Cabrillo Park (TLC) Alliance, and the  effort convinced city officials to change their minds about the trees.  </P> <P> "This has really given us some faith in the system," said Paula Cobb, who led  the movement to save the trees. "It's been a heartwarming experience that has  really pulled this neighborhood together. There's a community spirit now that  has never existed before in the 10 years that I've lived here."  </P> <P> This week, city officials sat down with leaders of TLC Alliance and came up  with a plan they believe will solve the sidewalk problem and save most of the  liquidambars. They plan to install a meandering sidewalk around many of the  trees and do some "root shaving" on other trees that they say may reduce the  diameter of some of the roots by as much as 50%, said Larry Christian, city  maintenance manager.  </P> <P> "It looks like we will be able to save at least 77 trees if we do some  modifications and we're going to do our darndest to save the remaining ones as  well," Christian said.  </P> <P> Before the meandering sidewalk can be installed, at least two-thirds of the  residents must approve a ballot measure saying that they are willing to give up  a five-foot easement lining the edges of the several condominium and townhouse  complexes on Cabrillo Park Drive.  </P> <P> "I believe that when all the facts are presented to the homeowners, we won't  have a problem getting their approval," Cobb said.  </P> <P> Councilmen Miguel A. Pulido Jr. and John Acosta, who both approved the removal  project on May 7, pledged support to the residents during a TLC Alliance  meeting last Saturday. Pulido said this week that most of the council wasn't  aware of the impact that removing the trees would have.  </P> <P> To avoid such incidents in the future, Pulido has requested that the council  hold a study session to examine the possibility of forming a seven-member tree  advisory board that would review all tree-removal projects.  </P> <P> Fullerton resident Alden Kelley, a consulting arborist, said he has been  watching the Cabrillo Park Drive situation with interest and has examined many  of the liquidambars once slated for removal. He said the trees are in excellent  condition and are worth about $5,000 each. GREG HERNANDEZ  </P></p>

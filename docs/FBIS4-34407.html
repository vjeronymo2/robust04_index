			<p>BFN     [Text] Quito, 19 Jun (AFP) -- Violent clashes this Sunday  between Indians and merchants of the southern Ecuadoran Andean  region resulted in the injury of approximately 20 people by  blows, knives, and tear gas and the torching of a dozen vehicles  and an Indian community house, the police have informed.    Indians who have been protesting against an agrarian  development law since 13 June clashed with merchants and  residents in the cities of El Tambo and Azogues, Canar Province,  270 km south of Quito, leading the Army to intervene.    Journalists from the newspaper EL MERCURIO, which is  published in Cuenca, near the place where the incidents took  place, told AFP the Indians had "seized" food from stores and  markets in El Tambo and Azogues and then tried to boycott the  weekly fair this Sunday.    The merchants and residents organized themselves and  discovered that a large portion of the food seized by the  Indians was stored in an Indian community house. They recovered  their products and torched the house, leading the Indians to  regroup and confront the merchants. As a result, a dozen people  were injured, and approximately 10 vehicles were burned.    Approximately 1,200 vehicles are trapped north of Cuenca,  and  Army soldiers repressed Indians with tear gas in the south of  Cuenca, near Santa Isabel, 350 km south of Quito. Approximately  eight Indians were beaten up in the clashes.    The agrarian development law spurred the Indians to protest  throughout the Andean and Amazon regions, except in the area  north of Quito, where an annual festival is being prepared.    The protests consist of highway blockings to impede the  shipment of food. The government has ordered the public order  forces to avoid confrontations and has not ordered the reopening  of the highways.    Ecuadoran President Sixto Duran-Ballen will receive Indian  leaders on 20 June to talk about the agrarian law. According to  the Indian leaders, such laws provide benefits to business firms  and landowners, whose farm products are exported to the  detriment of the benefits which the peasants and small  landowners used to enjoy.</p>

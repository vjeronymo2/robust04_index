			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / The Lex Column: ICL Few investors would experience paroxysms of excitement at the prospect of investing in a company which generates just Pounds 26m of distributable profits on sales of Pounds 2.5bn. Throw in fast-changing markets, weighty capital spending needs and ferocious competition and it all adds up to a seemingly unpalatable brew. Yet some time before the end of 1995, ICL, the UK's flagship computer company in which Fujitsu holds an 80 per cent stake, is committed to a partial flotation. It would be wise to be patient. Yesterday's results certainly showed ICL to be performing more resiliently than most dared hope. To record any profit in today's unforgiving computer markets ranks as a considerable achievement. ICL has proved nimbler than most in moving away from mainframe markets into more profitable services and mid-range systems. It has also demonstrated stringent management controls, mitigating a 6 percentage point fall in gross margins by cutting its operating expenses to revenue ratio by 2 points. Yet there are few signs of any market upswing; indeed trading conditions may deteriorate further this year. This makes the timing of any flotation tricky given the momentum of expectation building both within and outside the company. It would be a shame if ICL felt compelled to fatten itself up for the market and let short-term considerations impinge on its development. Its alliance with Fujitsu has created the confidence to increase research and development expenditure and make acquisitions throughout the recession. That will bring its own rewards.</p>

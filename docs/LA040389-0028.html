			<p><P> April 3, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOOKS;  </P> <P> AN UNBELIEVABLE TALE OF A FAMILY OF CARNIVAL FREAKS  </P> <P> Geek Love by Katherine Dunn (Alfred A. Knopf: $18.95; 348 pages)  </P> <P> First you have to imagine a carnival show, with a very lovable paterfamilias  named Al (married to loving and tender Lillian), who, because the family's got  to live some way, doses up his compliant wife on every horrid drug they can  think of, so that their children won't have to learn a trade -- they'll be born  with it, their very own "freak" career -- and the family will be able to stay  together forever under a happy, traveling roof, an elite group of outcasts,  journeying through the wasteland of "norms" that is heartland America.  </P> <P> The narrator here is a middle child, Olympia, a nice girl who barely "made the  cut." (Any normal children born to Lil and Al get abandoned by the roadside.  Some of Al and Lil's kids, on the other hand, are too strange to live; they lie  dead, floating in murky jars, where they too can be viewed for a modest fee.)  </P> <P> Be that as it may, Olympia is run-of-the-mill: A hunchback Albino dwarf, bald,  with bright red eyes. Oly's siblings include a pair of very sweet Siamese twins  who share one torso, one set of legs, and late in the book have one enormous  baby, Mumpo. Olympia also has a kind of thalidomide-variant older brother named  Arturo who's made up of a torso, a pair of flippers and a very evil mind.  Finally, she has a nice younger brother named Fortunato, or "Chick," who  appears so "normal" that he's almost abandoned, but that would have been a big  mistake on the part of Lil and Al, since Chick has telekinetic and healing  powers, and is terribly nice besides.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Seedy Boarding House  </P> <P> The novel begins in the fictional present, when disaster has already befallen  the traveling show. Olympia now lives in a seedy boardinghouse with her  demented mother. Upstairs, totally unaware that the Albino dwarf she's  acquainted with is actually her mother, Lil and Al's grandchild works as a  stripper and lives a harmless, uneventful life. Young Miranda is beautiful and  kind and has nothing to mark her as particularly strange except for a cute,  curly tail.  </P> <P> The plot, then, in the present, is: A large, rich, unattractive lesbian heiress  to a fast-food fortune has been finding pretty girls and paying them to have  their breasts removed -- to be chopped down past the essentials, as it were.  This mean woman has almost persuaded Miranda to go along with the paring away  procedure -- to have her tail removed. It's Olympia's God-given task to protect  her child from this abomination.  </P> <P> The large lesbian, ironically, has learned her bad tricks from a member of  Olympia's family. The body (so to say) of "Geek Love" occurs in the past, when  Arturo, the boy with the flippers and the bad disposition, invented a kind of  ad-hoc religion that involved his followers getting their fingers and toes  lopped off one at a time, then their thighs and forearms and so on, so that  they might live, finally, in a nursing home with just their torso and head, in  a state of P.I.P. ("Peace, Isolation and Purity"). Obviously, in the long run,  no good could come of this, which is one reason Olympia lives away in that  boardinghouse with her mother and daughter.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Imitates Nathanael West  </P> <P> The material here is straight Nathanael West: "Geek Love" is, in a sense, an  uneasy marriage of West's "Miss Lonelyhearts" and "A Cool Million, or, the  Dismantling of Lemuel Pitkin." The tone is something else: That a "freak" can  experience love as well as a "norm" may be one message here -- except that  Arturo is certainly the meanest freak who ever came down the pike. Another  theme has to do with completion: How many body parts does it take to make a  genuine human?  </P> <P> I had a lot of trouble with this book -- although Katherine Dunn is a powerful  and interesting writer. "Geek Love" is too long, too obviously derivative, and  I had trouble believing all those "freaks" in the first place. Their souls, as  well as their bodies, seemed out of kilter. I didn't believe the twins, or  Arturo, or Lil or Al. And isn't that the first requirement of any carnival --  that the customer believe the glittery, murky life that, half-shaded, goes on  behind the soiled curtains of the side show?  </P></p>

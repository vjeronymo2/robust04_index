			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / Finance and the Family: Only 19 days to go Sponsors of business expansion schemes are speaking already of only 19 BES shopping days to go before the scheme ends on December 31. But the shopping list includes a number of new items. One is BESSA Portman, sponsored by Close Brothers. This will buy up mainly properties repossessed by the Portman building society, to be let on assured tenancies. The cash-backed fixed rate return is 121p after five years for every 100p invested, equivalent to an annual return of 14.8 per cent to higher-rate taxpayers. Alternatively, investors can choose a fixed return of 80p a share plus 1p for every 1 per cent rise in interest rates (3 month Libor) each quarter, above a minimum of 5.5 per cent. The minimum investment is Pounds 2,000. Chiltern Homes III is another scheme sponsored by Downing Corporate Finance to raise Pounds 3m for the Chiltern Hundreds Housing Association. This is aimed at providing homes at affordable rents to families on low incomes, and disabled people. The fixed return of 128p is cash-backed and equates to an annual return of 14.2 per cent to a higher-rate taxpayer since BES 3 certificates, enabling investors to obtain tax relief, are not expected until May. Best BES Advice, an industry analyst, recommends this issue as 'a good value housing association.' The minimum investment is Pounds 2,000. Hodgson Martin has launched the Final Oxford Colleges Company, a 10-year BES with cash backing for student accommodation at St Hugh's and St Catherine's colleges. The exit price is 160p, equating to 10 per cent a year for a higher-rate taxpayer. After five years, investors have the option of accepting an annual buy-back offer by the colleges. Minimum investment: Pounds 2,000. Johnson Fry has launched a range of contracted exit schemes. Bradford &amp; Bingley has an exit price of 118p (equating to an annual return of 14.1 per cent to a higher-rate taxpayer) while University of Exeter's exit price is 120p (14.27 per cent per annum). The exit price on Mortgage Express is 121.2p (14.64 per cent a year) and University of Anglia has a fixed exit price of 125p (14.7 per cent a year), but it has no cash or bank backing. Minimum investment in any of the schemes is Pounds 3,000. Matrix Securities. meanwhile, has increased - from 125p to 128.5p - the exit price on its Homes for the Needy for two housing associations. As ever, potential investors should take professional advice before placing money in any of the 45 arranged exit schemes, 25 assured tenancy schemes and at least 26 trading companies now on the market.</p>

			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / International Bonds: Credit-card backed FRN issues to raise Dollars 1.41bn The eurobond market yesterday saw the launch of several straight bond issues in a variety of currencies and three asset-backed deals. Merrill Lynch set two global US credit-card-backed floating rate note issues for First USA Credit Card Master Trust: a six-year deal worth Dollars 539m and a nine-year deal totalling Dollars 880m, with the longer-dated tranche meeting with greater demand, according to the lead manager. Most market players said they expected the bulk of the deals to be placed in the US, but according to the lead manager, some 30 per cent had been placed in Europe, citing typical FRN investors such as banks and money market funds. Kidder Peabody brought an unusual asset-backed deal backed by Mexican tourism receivables. The Dollars 160m senior tranche for Seventh Mexican Acceptance Corporation, is expected to yield 400-425 basis points over Treasuries and targeted mainly at emerging market investors. In the sterling sector, HMC Mortgage Notes, a special purpose vehicle, launched a mortgage-backed deal in three tranches via Lehman Brothers totalling Pounds 210m. Elsewhere, Kellogg, the US food company, joined the recent stream of Canadian dollar issuers with a CDollars 140m issue of 8 1/8 per cent three-year bonds targeted largely at retail investors. Although the issue was deemed to be aggressively priced, yielding 7 1/2 basis points over the Canadian government bond, the name attracted good retail demand in Switzerland and the Benelux countries, according to lead manager Lehman Brothers. 'It's a great name, and they're not a very frequent issuer,' said a trader at another house. Kellogg also issued a SFr130m private placement targeted at Swiss investors. Elsewhere, the Kingdom of Denmark tapped the euroyen sector for Y50bn of bonds in two tranches: a Y25bn issue of zero-coupon two-year bonds and Y25bn of 3 per cent three-year bonds. The paper was largely targeted at Japanese retail investors, according to Daiwa Europe, who were joint lead manager with Fuji International Finance. Finland was said to be poised to tap the euroyen sector today for Y20bn-Y25bn of 20-year bonds, with Yamaichi tipped as lead manager. In the Italian lira sector, Austria's OKB Bank issued L200bn of 11.35 per cent three-year bonds. Lead manager Deutsche Bank said it identified retail demand for lira bonds in Switzerland, the Benelux and Italy, in spite of recent turbulence in the Italian bond and currency markets.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] THE NATION's FM-96 radio news station will resume  broadcasting this morning after being suspended for three days  by the army over a program considered to be critical of the  armed forces. The Territorial Defense Department, which owns  the station, blacked out the 24-hour broadcast on Sunday.    Supreme Command Spokesman Anuson Kritsanaserani said  yesterday comments by well-known social critic Sulak Siwarak,  who was a guest on THE NATION News Talk program last Saturday,  were "biased" against the military.    "The army chief has laid down a policy that no army-owned  radio stations must be allowed to air programs critical of the  military," he said. FM-96 is leased to NPG Broadcasting Network  an affiliate of THE NATION Publishing Group.    Suphap Klikachai, managing director of NPG Broadcasting,  said  the department had agreed to broadcasts resuming this morning.</p>

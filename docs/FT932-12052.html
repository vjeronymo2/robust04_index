			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / World Trade News: Nafta to go into effect as scheduled says Puche Mexican trade minister Jaime Serra Puche said this week it was 'highly probable' that Nafta would go into effect on January 1, 1994 as scheduled despite rising criticism in the US, Reuter reports from Mexico City. He also said that discussions on parallel accords to the still unratified trade pact are going well and the negotiators should have 'important bases' for preparing a final text of the agreement These are aimed at strengthening Nafta's environmental and labour provisions. The trade agreement would phase out most trade barriers between the US, Canada and Mexico. Mr Serra warned that opposition to Nafta should be expected to grow as it gets nearer to becoming reality. The pact was signed last year but still has to be approved by the legislatures of the three countries.</p>

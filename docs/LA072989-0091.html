			<p><P> July 29, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 600 FELINES WILL COMPETE AT INTERNATIONAL CAT SHOWS  </P> <P> INCATS it's called, standing for International Cat Shows, and it returns this  weekend to the Anaheim Convention Center.  </P> <P> It's billed as "the largest and most prestigious cat competition in the  country," and maybe it is. Whatever, about 600 felines -- household pets and 40  breeds of purebred prize winners -- are competing in a 16-ring program, and if  last year's turnout is an indication, more than 25,000 ailurophiles are  expected to attend.  </P> <P> Along with the main competitions for "top cat" (finals Sunday afternoon) and  the usual grooming demonstrations, cat-product exhibits and breed-information  center, a "Supercat" competition will be held today, noon to 2 p.m., sponsored  by Hills Pet Products for the benefit of Actors and Others for Animals. The  competition is open only to formerly homeless cats, adopted and/or rescued, and  includes whimsical categories of competition (i.e. cat/owner look-alikes),  celebrity judges, prizes and ribbons.  </P> <P> On Sunday, also from noon until 2 p.m., Whiskas puts on a "Household Cat of the  Year" contest with winners receiving an all-expenses-paid trip to New York for  a final competition in Madison Square Garden. (Winner of that show gets to fly  to London for the "Supreme Cat Show.")  </P> <P> The center is at 800 W. Katella Ave. in Anaheim. Hours are 9 a.m.-6 p.m. today  and Sunday. Admission is $6 for adults, $4 for seniors 65 and older and  children under 12. Call (818) 896-3875 for further information.  </P></p>

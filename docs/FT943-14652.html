			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / International Company News: Japan's banks get tough on debt  -Sumitomo Trust's acquiescence in a bankruptcy may suggest hardening attitudes The decision last week by Sumitomo Trust and Banking Corporation to acquiesce in the bankruptcy of one of its larger debtors raised a few eyebrows in Japanese financial circles. Having been in intensive care for the past three years, Nippon Mortgage Co was allowed to go under with debts to Sumitomo Trust of more than Y120bn (Dollars 1.2bn). The liquidation raised questions about the condition of non-bank financial institutions - companies like Nippon Mortgage which represent the weakest link in the fragile financial system - but also about the larger banks' strategy for dealing with the mountain of bad debts they hold. Some analysts saw the readiness of Sumitomo Trust to agree to the liquidation as further evidence of a more aggressive approach to the writing-off of bad debts. Mr Mark Faulkner, banking analyst at SG Warburg in Tokyo, said: 'Sumitomo Trust's action suggests a new level of confidence, which is shared by other banks, about the fundamental health of banking operations.' The bank is likely to be able to meet the write-off by using only a small proportion of its unrealised gains on equity holdings. Sumitomo Trust's action was said to have filled the boardrooms of some non-banks with alarm at the prospect of other large banks taking a similarly aggressive approach to the bad debt problem. But what are the prospects that banks will adopt such a stance towards their non-bank debtors? The main companies in difficulty are the housing loan (jusen) companies. These were established in the 1970s by the large commercial banks for the explicit purpose of residential mortgage lending, an area where the leading banks faced restrictions on their activities. For more than a decade the residential property sector was the jusen's main market, but in the 1980s the rules were relaxed so that banks themselves could take that business. Casting around for a profitable market niche, the jusen hit upon the commercial real estate market, at that time in the early stages of the 1980s boom. With near abandon, they lent thousands of billions of yen, secured on what was seen as a rock solid property market, for the next few years - until the bubble burst at the end of the decade. Since then it has been estimated that as a result of the lending spree, as much as 60 per cent of the jusen total loan book may be non-performing. All this would simply be another story of post-bubble collapse, if it were not for the fact that the companies' primary source of funds was the main commercial banks - already burdened with non-performing loans of their own. The banks are therefore left with an estimated Y12,000bn in loans to the jusen. The main approach in dealing with the problem loans has been 'restructuring' of the housing loan companies' debt. The ministry of finance - as ever, anxious to avoid a large collapse - has orchestrated the strategy. The current plan is aimed at spreading the burden among the leading banks. Of the main lenders, the country's agricultural banks have the greatest exposure to the non-banks - accounting for nearly half the total lending. Though precise figures are sketchy, it appears that interest paid to them on the debts of the housing loan companies has been cut to 4.5 per cent, while other banks - notably trust banks, who have been particularly hard hit by the non-banks' problems - are lending at 2.5 per cent or lower. Some of the healthier banks would undoubtedly like simply to cut their losses on these non-performing loans. But while they may be able to deal with smaller debtors in this way, liquidating the jusen is unlikely to be easy. For one thing, while the finance ministry might be content to see the isolated disappearance of a few finance companies like Nippon Mortgage, it would surely balk at a domino-like collapse of non-banks. Later this year, under ministry of finance guidance, banks will start to establish special purchase companies to which they will be able to sell their non-performing loans at a discount, partially removing them from the balance sheet. But more important, the banks themselves would find it difficult to turn off the life support system of the jusen. Nippon Mortgage was a special case, since its liabilities were heavily weighted towards one bank - Sumitomo Trust. The jusen's liabilities are spread across many of the commercial banks, and any decision to liquidate would need to be taken in agreement with all the banks - notoriously hard to achieve, since some banks are healthier than others and would be more willing to act. In any case, commercial logic does not dictate that the banks should bring about the closure of more than a few small non-banks. Many of the non-banks, though technically insolvent, are able to maintain positive cashflow, since their interest payments to the banks are now so low. As Mr David Threadgold, banking analyst at BZW in Tokyo, says: 'It is as though the housing loan companies are brain dead, but on life support. Their cashflow is such that they can continue operating for some time.' Any decision by banks to turn off the machine would expose the balance-sheet problems of the non-banks, and reveal the true scale of their bad debt problem - something that they may not yet wish to do.</p>

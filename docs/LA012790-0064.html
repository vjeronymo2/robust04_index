			<p><P> January 27, 1990, Saturday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> WORLD IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> HAITI;  </P> <P> FRANCE STOPS AID DURING CRACKDOWN  </P> <P> The French government condemned the state of siege and media censorship imposed  by military ruler Prosper Avril and suspended economic aid to Haiti until the  crackdown is lifted. Lt. Gen. Avril had been expected to lift the state of  siege Friday but did not appear on national television for a scheduled 10 a.m.  speech.  </P> <P> There was no explanation for the delay. The French Embassy in the capital  announced the decision on aid, which was made in Paris by the Foreign Ministry.  Last year, France provided about $23 million in assistance to Haiti, and this  year's allotment had been expected to be about $35 million.  </P></p>

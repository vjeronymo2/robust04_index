			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / Arts: Today's Television Compared to Paris in the great pre-war days of Joyce, Hemingway and Picasso, the post war years were pretty lacklustre. Moreover, as time goes by the stature of the pre-war crowd continues to grow while that of the post-war group (Sartre, Camus, de Beauvoir, Genet) begins to shrink. Nevertheless, it is the period starting in 1945 to which Melvyn Bragg turns his attention in Channel 4's art and culture series, Without Walls (9.00). With luck Prime Suspect 2 will contain the slick production skills and excellent acting of the original (Helen Mirren stars again as the high ranking police detective) without the tedious feminist propaganda. This time (9.00 then 10.40, concluding tomorrow, ITV) the script has been written by Allan Cubitt. Murder is the topic once more, with the body of a young girl found in an Afro-Caribbean neighbourhood. In Troubleshooter 2 (9.50 BBC2), Sir John Harvey-Jones visits one of the first hospital groups to be granted NHS Trust status and remarks: 'No one in their right mind would build the hospitals you've got and no one in their right mind would leave a hospital half complete'.</p>

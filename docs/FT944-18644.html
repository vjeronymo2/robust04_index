			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / This Week: Music American superstars REM make their contribution to the British interest rate debate with the opening title of their new album, 'What's the Frequency, Kenneth?' The rest of Monster (Warner Bros) marks a return to the group's heavier style, which will disappoint those who appreciated the subtlety of their recent material. There is still a freshness and originality about the band which helps to explain their phenomenal success. However, tickets for next spring's UK dates sold out swiftly. The American composer Carlisle Floyd wrote his folkloric opera Susannah when he was only 28. He has waited nearly 40 years since its first performance in 1955 to see its first studio recording, released this week by Virgin Classics. Cheryl Studer and Samuel Ramey sing the leads, Kent Nagano conducts the Orchestre de l'Opera de Lyon. Admirers of mellow, country sounds - and there are more of them around than ever - will enjoy new albums by two of the most sophisticated singer-songwriters on the scene. Lyle Lovett's I Love Everybody (MCA) lies firmly in the tradition of such Texan criers-into-their-beer as Townes Van Zandt and the seminal Guy Clark. There is plenty of wit and quirkiness in Lovett's material, never better demonstrated than in his complaint that he just can't pick up a pretty girl no more. Mmmmm. Nanci Griffith looks forward to her Royal Albert Hall dates next week (October 10-12) with the release of Flyer (MCA), a pleasant collection of tunes featuring some very worthy guests such as U2's Adam Clayton, Mark Knopfler and The Chieftains. Celebrations of The Carpenters' 25th anniversary (of their signing to their record label) continue with Interpretations (A&amp;M), a 21-track collection of other people's material, including Burt Bacharach's 'Close to You', John Lennon and Paul McCartney's 'Ticket to Ride' and - less happily - Don Henley and Glenn Frey's 'Desperado'. Tchaikovsky's music for solo piano has tended to be over-shadowed by the immense popularity of his Concerto No 1 in B flat minor. Mikhail Pletnev tackles The Seasons and Six Pieces in a bright new recording on Virgin Classics.</p>

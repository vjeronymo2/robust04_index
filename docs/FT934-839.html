			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Cheap power deal clears way for NZ aluminium expansion Comalco and Sumitomo, owners of the Bluff aluminium smelter, New Zealand's biggest industrial complex, are planning a NZDollars 300m (Pounds 113m) expansion following this week's controversial decision by the government to continue to give the smelter cheap power till 2012. A Radio New Zealand report said that under the new contract Comalco will pay substantially less than the city of Auckland, which has a population of 1m and uses an equivalent amount of power. The Dominion newspaper reported yesterday that the decision to approve the deal struck between state owned electricity company Electricorp and Comalco had split the cabinet. The minority Alliance Party, pledged to support the government, which has a very small majority, expressed disquiet at the decision. The Dominion said the decision was pushed through by the prime minister, Mr Jim Bolger, and the finance minister, Mr Bill Birch, after a long debate. A number of other ministers expressed concern about the uncertainty of energy supplies and wanted the contract renegotiated. Ms Jeannette Fitzsimmons, an Alliance spokesperson, said that the smelter was New Zealand's single biggest industrial user of electricity, taking 15 per cent. She said that the contract expired in the same year that New Zealand was due to take the last gas from its large offshore Maui field. 'It means New Zealand will probably have to switch to coal generation at a time when the world will be increasingly concerned at emission problems,' she said. Comalco's managing director, Mr Kerry McDonald, said that the price and continuity of supply would permit the company to go ahead with the expansion . He said however that a final decision to expand rested with Comalco and Sumitomo.</p>

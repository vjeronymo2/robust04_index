The parliamentary group of the Hungarian Democratic  Union of Romania, UDMR, asked for permission to make a political  declaration on part of the articles of the said bill. Submitted  to vote, the request was rejected. Consequently the members of  the UDMR parliamentary group walked out of the Senate Hall.    The Senate passed in its Monday, March 21 sitting an  amendment to an article of the bill on war veterans and widows  saying that the residents of Romanian territories occupied over  1940-1945, that were called to arms fight in the Armies of other  states are considered to be war veterans only "if they did not  fight against the Romanian Army."

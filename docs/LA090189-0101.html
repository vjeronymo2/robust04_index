			<p><P> September 1, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COULD CAUSE CIVIL WAR, THEY TELL U.S. REPORTERS;  </P> <P> SOVIET DELEGATES SEE NATIONALIST THREAT  </P> <P> Nationality conflicts in the Soviet Union threaten the reform process and could  explode into civil wars unless the disputes are resolved by constitutional  changes, visiting deputies from the new Soviet parliament said Thursday.  </P> <P> Their candid appraisal came amid reports from Moscow of a hardening attitude by  the Kremlin leadership toward challenges by the Baltic republics of Estonia,  Latvia and Lithuania. Demands for greater autonomy have also led to nationalist  unrest in Moldavia, Georgia and other regions.  </P> <P> "The (political) system as it is cannot be preserved or it would lead only to  tragic consequences," said Nikolai V. Fyodorov, a newly elected deputy of the  new Supreme Soviet, a parliamentary body of 500 members set up to replace its  rubber-stamp predecessor.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Equal Partners' Doctrine  </P> <P> A new Soviet constitution under consideration, he said, would establish a union  based on an "equal partners" doctrine that would attempt to satisfy nationalist  feelings in the Baltic republics and elsewhere.  </P> <P> "Without a solution, there will be a great sharpening of the situation, with  emergency procedures or martial law in certain republics, with counteractions,"  Fyodorov added. "It would be very similar to a civil war."  </P> <P> Andrei E. Sebentsov, an electrical engineer from Moscow who is also a new  deputy, agreed that the nationality disputes are "very serious and create the  possibility of great conflicts" that he said would strengthen the position of  conservatives who oppose President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's program of  perestroika, or restructuring.  </P> <P> But Sebentsov said it is childish for groups in the Baltic republics to think  that secession from the Soviet Union is the only way to achieve their  nationalist aspirations. Greater autonomy, he said, could resolve many of their  demands.  </P> <P> Konstantin D. Lubenchenko, head of the visiting delegation, added that the  crisis over nationality problems requires creation of a new Soviet economic  system that would include greater use of market incentives and introduce the  concept of private property as well.  </P> <P> Such changes, he said, would create an economic incentive for the Baltic  republics to remain part of the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> The delegation, together with three staff aides, came to the United States to  study the day-to-day workings of Congress in hopes of applying some American  techniques to the new Soviet parliament. The deputies spoke to reporters  through an interpreter.  </P> <P> Lubenchenko said that he and the two other deputies are members of a Supreme  Soviet committee on legislation, legality and law and order that will have a  strong influence on the procedures adopted by the new body.  </P> <P> Electronic voting, he said, will be used to speed its work and also let Soviet  citizens know, for the first time, how their representatives vote. In the past,  the Supreme Soviet almost invariably gave unanimous approval to recommendations  of Soviet leaders.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Impressed With Data  </P> <P> "About two-thirds of the deputies did not want roll calls published," said  Sebentsov. "It may be hard for some deputies, but they'll just have to get used  to it."  </P> <P> Fyodorov said the delegation is impressed by the amount of information that  members of Congress have available to evaluate executive proposals and help  them draft legislation.  </P> <P> "Until we establish independent sources of information, . . . we will not be  able to establish freedom and democracy," he said.  </P> <P> The Soviet delegation went to the Supreme Court as well as Congress and will  spend Labor Day weekend in Salt Lake City to meet with Rep. Wayne Owens  (D-Utah) and city and state officials.  </P> <P> Describing their pioneering efforts to construct a democratic legislature,  Lubenchenko said: "You should think of us as bricklayers, building a house  without a blueprint, but we desire to build a very good house."  </P></p>

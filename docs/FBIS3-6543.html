"The direction should be indicated as concretely as  possible," Kubota, director general of the Economic Planning  Agency (EPA), told a regular news conference after a morning  cabinet meeting.    Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa urged ministers concerned  to  work harder in the macroeconomic field, she said.    Kubota said tax cuts, expansion of domestic demand and  cutting the current account surplus need further discussion.    The coalition government has already vowed to enact  permanent  tax reform this year, which is expected to offset reductions of  income tax and other taxes by hiking the consumption tax.    The reform is seen as answering U.S. complaints that this  year's 6 trillion yen in income and resident's tax cuts are just  one-time measures and will not give domestic demand the  sustained boost needed to help cut Japan's trade surplus.    Suggestions have emerged in recent days to include such  macroeconomic steps in the market-opening package due by month's  end, which is to include deregulation, import promotion,  stricter antitrust enforcement and improved government  procurement practices.</p>

			<p><P> July 6, 1989, Thursday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> SANTA ANA ROBBERY SUSPECT SHOT  </P> <P> A Santa Ana police officer shot a robbery suspect in the leg at about 2:30 a.m.  today, hours after three men held up the Bobkin Bar at 2521 S. Main St. and  fled with $150.  </P> <P> The wounded man was identified as Ramon Soto, 20, of Santa Ana, said Santa Ana  police spokeswoman Maureen Thomas. He was treated at Western Medical Center and  transferred to the Orange County Jail, she said.  </P> <P> Police did not release the name of the officer.  </P> <P> The incident began when three men walked into the bar at 11:15 p.m. Wednesday  and stole $150, Thomas said. Police investigators who had been called to the  scene found an AK-47 that was apparently used during the robbery and obtained  the address of one of the suspects from a customer, Thomas said.  </P> <P> They went to the address in Santa Ana, and Soto confronted them at the  driveway, Thomas said.  </P> <P> "Officers told him to stop, but he fled on foot, and they continued asking him  to stop," Thomas said. "One of our officers fired one shot from his shotgun. It  struck the suspect in the leg."  </P> <P> Two other suspects were arrested at the address. Thomas declined to immediately  release their names, saying that "it would hamper an ongoing investigation."  </P></p>

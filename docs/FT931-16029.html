			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / Staff vote to fight market testing THE FIRST serious union resistance to the government's plans to contract out Civil Service jobs to the private sector has come from the traditionally moderate Inland Revenue Staff Federation. IRSF members have voted by six to one to take industrial action against the market testing of secretarial work in the Inland Revenue. Nearly three quarters of the union's 56,000 members - an unusually high proportion - voted in the ballot. Mr Clive Brooke, the IRSF general secretary, insisted last night that the union was not trying to halt market testing - a preparatory stage to the putting of government functions out to tender - but merely to set conditions on the way it was organised. One union condition is that there should be no extension of such testing until the results of four prototype schemes are known. They have involved 200 secretarial staff at four sites. A second round of market testing involving about 4,000 secretarial staff is being prepared. The second condition is that there should be no deterioration in the pay and conditions of staff transferred to the private sector. The union argues that such protection is, in any case, required by the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) regulations of 1981, based on a European Community directive. Apart from some industrial action at the Scottish Office the Civil Service unions have, until now, been uncertain how to respond to contracting-out, with most emphasis being placed on the transfer of undertakings legislation. The IRSF vote may encourage activists to believe that industrial as well as legal action can be used against the government. However, the question that IRSF members voted on was carefully worded and specifically emphasised industrial action short of a strike. The question did call on members 'not to co-operate with any further market testing' until the outcome of the four prototype schemes was known and assessed.</p>

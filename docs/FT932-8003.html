			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Bass out of market favour DISAPPOINTING results from Bass, Britain's largest brewer, sent the shares into freefall in their largest recorded daily trading volume. The stock ended at 483p, down 50, with turnover reaching 11m. Every drinks specialist seemed to have a particular grouse with the Bass interim report, ranging from disappointment with Holiday Inns to astonishment at the level of cash outflow. The first-half outcome was a profits figure well below the most cautious City forecasts, prompting a welter of downgrades and negative comments. Kleinwort Benson lowered its full year forecast by 10 per cent to Pounds 503m, while NatWest cut to Pounds 508m and SGST to Pounds 490m. Analysts also reported a gloomy post-results meeting. Mr Geoff Collyer at NatWest said: 'There was nothing in the Bass explanation that indicated that their strategy is going to work.' SGST's Ms Alex Oldroyd added: 'Even if trading picks up, investors will take a lot of convincing to get back into the stock.' Other sector specialists claimed that some disgruntled institutional investors were critical of the Bass management and there was speculation that pressure could be exerted for a splitting of the roles of chairman and chief executive.</p>

			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / Unit trusts reach Pounds 76.3bn record UNIT TRUST sales enjoyed their second-best quarter on record in the three months to the end of June, with net sales reaching nearly Pounds 2.5bn. Total funds invested in unit trusts reached an all-time high of Pounds 76.3bn, compared with Pounds 57bn at the end of June 1992. Figures from the Association of Unit Trusts and Investment Funds showed that sales of personal equity plans played an important role. Returns within a Pep are tax-free and after the recent falls in interest rates some Peps can now offer higher income returns than building society deposits. Net sales of unit trust Peps in the second quarter were Pounds 741.5m, up from Pounds 336.4m in the same period last year. But even without the tax attractions of Peps, investors seem to be switching from cash to equities. Overall, private investors bought a net Pounds 1.98bn of unit trusts in the first half of the year; the industry made net repurchases from private investors in the first half of 1992. The only time that the current level of unit trust sales has been exceeded was in the third quarter of 1987, just before the stock market crash of October that year. The sector which attracted the most money from private investors was UK Balanced, which combines bonds and equities to offer a high income. The industry continues to launch new funds. There are now 1,537 trusts managed by 160 groups.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Conservative Party [CP] has indicated its  reasons for not wanting to participate in the election on 27  April:    1. According to the CP, the new constitution does not  recognize the Holy Trinity, making other gods equal with the  Almighty God. References to Christian values which have been  removed from the constitution, will make South Africa a totally  secular state.    2. This election is the final process of the handing over of  power which has been initiated by the communists through war,  terror, negotiations and peace accords. Participation in the  communist-dominated transitional structures will tantamount to  the recognition of all these illegal structures, and the  participation in them by the Boer-Afrikaner nation.    3. If the CP participates in the election, it will be forced  to recognize the result and other constitutional elements such  as the flag.    4. The so-called amendments effected fail to bring us even a  step closer to obtaining a volkstaat [Afrikaner homeland]. They  will in fact only speed up the reality of unitary state. A  volkstaat is therefore out of the question.    5. The election will in no way be free and fair. Large-scale  irregularities in the registration of voters are taking place as  no control whatsoever exists.    6. The ANC-controlled SABC [South African Broadcasting  Corporation] TV is being unashamedly exploited for propaganda by  the National Party-ANC conspiracy. According to the CP, the  election is nothing else but the paving of the way for the  coming of an atheist, communist ANC government in the country.  The CP added that the Afrikaner nation, with the traditionally  bound Zulu nation, could never take part in the election. Those  who participate will be associating themselves with this highly  unacceptable situation in our fatherland.</p>

			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / Recovery in unit trust sales continues THE recovery in the unit trust market this year continued in March, when investors bought Pounds 1.19bn worth of units. The March figure, following sales of Pounds 1.32bn in February, reflected continuing buoyancy in stock markets worldwide this year and brought the gross amount invested in units in the first quarter to almost Pounds 3.2bn. This was nearly a fifth more than in the first quarter of last year. However, unitholders cashed in Pounds 880.9m worth of units in March, boosted by activity at the end of the financial year by certain life companies and other financial institutions. This brought total cash-ins for the quarter to Pounds 1.92m - still 15 per cent lower than in the first quarter of last year. Net new investment in unit trusts in March was Pounds 308.5m - less than half new investment in February of Pounds 836.5m but greater than any monthly figure in 1990. Net new investment so far this year, at Pounds 1.27bn, is triple that for the corresponding period last year. Further analysis of the figures from the Unit Trust Association shows that investors were interested in trusts across the whole spectrum, with particular interest in Japan. Funds under management rose by nearly Pounds 10bn over the quarter to Pounds 56.2bn. Figures were boosted by record sales of unit trust Personal Equity Plans amounting to Pounds 229m. The government yesterday paved the way for new rules governing the borrowing and investment powers of unit trusts, due to be published in draft form by the Securities and Investments Board today. The Department of Trade and Industry laid two orders before parliament enabling it to delegate rule-making in this area to SIB. Observer, Page 18</p>

			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / France's envoy killed during protest in Zaire THE FRENCH ambassador to Zaire was killed by a stray bullet in the capital Kinshasa yesterday, the French foreign ministry said, as soldiers opened fire and looted shops in protest at being paid in new banknotes, agencies report from Paris and Abidjan. Mr Philippe Bernard, 61, who was hit by a bullet through his office window, had been in Kinshasa since last month, the ministry said. Mr Etienne Tshisekedi, Zaire's prime minister, has declared the notes invalid and traders are refusing them, said Mr Willy Claes, Belgian foreign minister, on television in Belgium last night. The notes, introduced this week, are the latest bone of contention between the premier and President Mobutu Sese Seko, who has refused to give up control of the treasury. Troops looted shops and foreigners' homes yesterday.</p>

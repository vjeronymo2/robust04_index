			<p>Language: <F P=105>English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by correspondent Ashnarain Roy] </F>   [Text] The old adage -- physician heal thyself -- is  nowhere more appropriate and pertinent than in Pakistan, a case  [as heard] which has unabashedly sought to use human rights as a  stick to beat India in an attempt to cover up its blatant human  rights abuses. Within days of Pakistani prime minister, Ms.  Benazir Bhutto's vile charge at the Geneva meeting of the UN  Human Rights Commission that New Delhi was violating Kashmiri  human rights, the U.S. State Department has taken Pakistan to  task for its failure to protect the rights of non-Muslims who  have been subjected to frequent extrajudicial killings,  disappearance, and arbitrary arrests. The report has said that  religious zealots continue to discriminate against and persecute  non-Muslims basing their activities and part on discriminating  legislation against religious minorities. [sentence as heard]    Pakistani leaders have abused the international fora not  only  to internationalize the Kashmir issue, but also sought to  publicize lies and launched a hysterical tirade against India.  Both the union finance minister, Dr. Manmohan Singh, and the  former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister, Dr. Farooq Abdullah,  have done well to expose the real face of Islamabad at Geneva.  The State Department report is, by and large, in conformity  with similar reports of human rights violations catalogued by  the Amnesty International, the Human Rights Watch and the  American Civil Liberties Union.    Members of Pakistan's Hindu, Christian, Ahmediyas, Sikh,  Bahai, and other minority communities were banned from  contesting general seats in the elections in 1985 and were  restricted to voting in a system of separate electorate for  minorities. Ahmediyas have also suffered widespread  discrimination, suppression, and violence since they were  declared non-Muslims in 1974. The U.S. State Department report  has referred to extrajudicial killings, often in the form of  staged police encounters, resulting in the death of suspects as  also death resulting from physical abuse of prisoners and  detainees by police. It says there continues to be persuasive  evidence of misuse of police powers. Corruption, including  extortion, is rampant. Police and jailers often use force to  coerce confession and to compel detainees and prisoners to  discriminate others. Although police in Pakistan are required  by law to obtain a warrant before entering a private home, this  legal requirement is complied more in breach than in compliance  and Pakistan is using the law of blasphemy against minority  groups such as the Christians. This law is a threat to freedom  of expression and belief and it continues to allow exploitation  and intimidation in the name of religion.    Another discriminatory law against minorities pertains to  separate electorates. It not only violates the international  convention on civil and political rights but also the joint  electorates concept under the 1973 constitution. The most  recent encroachment on religious freedom is a requirement that  religion be listed on the national identity cards. Such a  practice amounts to religious apartheid. Even though Pakistan  has acceded to the universal declaration of human rights, its  laws violate article 25 and 18 of this declaration. Pakistan  has moved away from its founding principle of religious freedom.  Laws such as the convention law clearly violate basic  principles of international human rights. Pakistan is also a  signatory to basic human rights conventions. But its laws stand  in direct contradiction to the principles found in these  treaties.    In a new 74 page report, the Amnesty International said last  December that torture, including rape, in the custody of police,  paramilitary, and armed forces is endemic in Pakistan. The  report further said that members of these forces have been  allowed to torture and kill with impunity. Victims and their  families feel great difficulties and danger, if they try to seek  redress.</p>

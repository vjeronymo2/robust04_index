			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / Letter: Headline earnings per share figure may allow confusion and manipulation Sir, I see that your published company statistics will in future use the 'headline' earnings per share figure proposed by the Institute for Investment Management and Research, which broadly seeks to distinguish trading results from capital items. You are confident that their formula provides a 'factual and robust' basis for the statistics on which your readers rely. That may not be entirely justified. Your decision has no doubt been provoked by dissatisfaction with the all-embracing earnings per share figure now required by FRS3. However, the Accounting Standards Board chose that figure precisely because the headline numbers which many people prefer cannot deliver what they promise. As my firm has commented to the IIMR, headline earnings per share will not in practice be 'factual and robust'. That is because the seemingly attractive theoretical distinction between trading performance and capital gains and losses does not work in practice. An example concerns the costs of closing down a business. The headline earnings per share figure is supposed to exclude the costs of discontinuing the business, but to include trading results during the run down period. This distinction will often be meaningless, if not impossible to make. There is a danger that earnings per share figures based on these distinctions will be misunderstood and that misconceptions about the 'important' figures in accounts will be created. Experience has shown that focusing on an intermediate figure in the profit and loss account tends only to corrupt the figure itself. In making this change, you are in danger of putting the clock back and undermining the ASB's efforts to promote a deeper analysis of accounts rather than reliance on a simplistic and manipulable ratio.

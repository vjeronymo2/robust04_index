"I was only expecting a few of the deputies from the  Movement  for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) to support the law on  shortening the electoral period. It was the most beautiful  parliamentary game in the history of Slovakia," Weiss said.    He added that he would like to believe that this was the  germ  of an election campaign which would not be a hate-filled  struggle between political personalities, but would be a correct  and proper competition of manifestos on how to lead Slovakia out  of its crisis.    Christian Democratic Movement (KDH) Deputy Frantisek  Miklosko  said the voting was a clear signal that HZDS deputies, after the  lack of success of their referendum petition (which was found  not to contain enough proper signatures) had understood that  calling an election through a referendum was no longer possible,  and clearly did not have the strength to do so either. Thus  they had chosen the strategy of deciding on one of the dates put  forward after all, he said.    Chairman of the Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement  (MKDH) Bela Bugar said it was good that the question of early  elections was being solved in a constitutional way. This was  the most simple and cheapest solution, he said. Another way,  such as approving a proposal to call a referendum, would cost a  lot of money.    Milan Knazko, chairman of the Alliance of Democrats of the  Slovak Republic (AD SR) said he believed that for the deputies  of the former government coalition this was the last possibility  of achieving early elections. All that they had tried to do  before was their usual "variety politics," including the  referendum, in which (judging from the inauthentic petition  signatures) even fairy-tale beings would take part.    Knazko said he hoped that by the elections his party would  be  able to create a stable liberal right-of-centre bloc with  Ludovit Cernak's National Democratic Party and Moravcik and  Roman Kovac's Democratic Union of Slovakia.    Chairman of the preparatory committee of the National  Democratic Party Ludovit Cernak said he thought that the  Meciarites had made a proper assessment of the consequences of  not supporting the election date proposal. Refusing it would  have meant a fiasco for them; they were trying to limit the  damage.    Cernak said he was glad that, in spite of their huge  differences, Slovak deputies had sent the world a signal that  there were things they knew how to agree on. However, he did  not think the Meciarites could be said to have turned over a new  leaf, as they were still fiercely oppositional in their  behaviour. "There was no whistling in the Slovak parliament for  two years; now there is. Nonetheless, I am glad that the first  step is behind us," Cernak said.</p>

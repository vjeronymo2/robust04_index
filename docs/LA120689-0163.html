			<p><P> December 6, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ON THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> MCCANTS 'PLANS TO BE A SENIOR'  </P> <P> All-America linebacker Keith McCants told a Mobile newspaper that he will  return for his senior year at Alabama, but an Atlanta newspaper reported today  that he will pass up his final season to enter the NFL draft next year.  </P> <P> "The way I see it, Keith McCants is a junior at the University of Alabama, and  I'm planning on being a senior," he said in a Mobile Press Register interview  published today.  </P> <P> McCants finished second Monday in voting on the Butkus Award that goes to the  nation's top linebacker. "As far as the Butkus Award goes, I came in second but  I feel like it's a tremendous honor to be one of the finalists being that I'm  only a junior. So I've got another year to get it," McCants told the Mobile  paper.  </P> <P> The Atlanta Constitution, however, quoted unidentified sources close to McCants  and the school's athletic department as saying that the 6-foot-5, 256-pound  junior would bypass his senior year.  </P> <P> Crimson Tide Coach Bill Curry has told several staff members that McCants will  leave Alabama after this season, the newspaper quoted its sources as saying.  </P></p>

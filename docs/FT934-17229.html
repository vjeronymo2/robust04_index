			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Troll deal set to reshape Europe's gas industry - The record-breaking Dollars 100bn sales agreement with European buyers SUPERLATIVES describing Norway's Dollars 100bn Troll gas sales agreement can flow effortlessly beyond considered limits. Most agree, however that the deal represents a quantum leap into the future for the seller and European buyers and will alter forever and fundamentally the shape of Europe's gas industry. After seven years of innovatory, and sometimes frustrating, development preparations, gas under the huge Troll contract coursed its way from 6am today through the Zeepipe to supply Europe with 10 per cent of its gas needs. Under what is hailed as the largest commercial contract in the history of the petroleum industry, the gas is making its way to a consortium of European gas buyers, initially from the Norwegian North Sea Sleipner field. But from 1996 gas from the giant Troll itself, Europe's biggest offshore gas field, will flow over a period of more than 30 years to Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Spain. Troll sales will expand Norway's market share for gas in Germany to 23 per cent by the year 2000 from 14 per cent now, while in France it will rise to 23 per cent from 17 per cent, in Belgium to 33 per cent from 24 per cent and in the Netherlands to 13 per cent from 7 per cent. Spain and Austria are new buyers of Norway's gas, taking annual deliveries of 1.5bn and 1bn cubic metres a year respectively. Deliveries under the Troll agreement are scheduled to reach a peak of 44.7bn cu m a year from 2005, but the deal is forecast to boost Norway's annual gas exports from 25bn cu m - making the country the sixth largest gas exporter - to more than 60bn cu m in 2010. Negotiations already under way could eventually increase supplies to 70bn cu m a year as new domestic offshore gas fields come on stream. 'Towards the next century gas production will be of increasing importance, and it can be said that Norway will turn into a gas nation from being an oil nation,' says Mr Finn Kristensen, oil and industry minister. Norway is Europe's biggest oil producer with average daily output of about 2.3m barrels. Until 1986 it sold its gas under 'depletion' contracts covering the total reserves of a specific field. Frigg field gas has been supplied to Britain under this arrangement for the past 23 years and more than 110bn cu m will have been provided by the time the field runs dry in 1997. In sharp contrast, Troll gas buyers have signed supply contracts that specify gas deliveries over a set period. One major issue is the designation of new fields to make up a production capacity shortfall of 10bn cu m of gas already sold under supply contracts - above and beyond the Troll deal. No decision has yet been made on which fields could close this gap as negotiations for further supply quantities move towards agreement. Statoil, Norway's state oil company, believes future gas sales are unlikely to involve the huge volumes seen in the Troll agreements. 'No other Norwegian (gas) field matches the size of the giant Troll reservoir, making typical future contracts of 1bn-1.5bn cu m annually over a period of 15 to 20 years most likely,' it says. Nevertheless, the success of the Troll agreement has served to confound sceptics who for years said it would never come off because of the huge amount of capital required. Gas and oil prices are closely linked. 'When the Troll agreements were signed oil prices were around Dollars 8 a barrel compared with a current Dollars 15-Dollars 16' Statoil points out. 'In the interim, the Troll gas price has been renegotiated with German buyers and similar adjustments are under discussion with other customers.' There is an old industry maxim which runs: 'In the gas industry you must be very careful to do a good deal. But you must be even more careful not to do too good a deal'. That is a situation Troll's gas sellers are clearly seeking to avoid as they look for new business.</p>

			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / International Company News: Linotype falls into red and omits payout LINOTYPE-HELL, the German printing equipment manufacturer, will not pay a dividend for 1991 after falling into the red as a result of weak export sales and heavy restructuring costs. It announced a group net loss of DM9.9m (Dollars 5.95m) compared with a profit of DM37.5m in 1990. The decision to leave out the dividend follows a cut of DM2 to DM13 a share in the previous payment. Mr Wolfgang Kummer, chief executive, described 1991 as an 'extraordinarily difficult year'. Turnover had risen from DM806m to DM1.2bn, but this was entirely because of Linotype's merger with Rudolf Hell, formerly owned by Siemens, the German electrical and electronics group, which has a one-third stake in the enlarged company. Excluding the effect of the merger, sales were 19 per cent lower; incoming orders fell at the same rate. Problems in the world economy masked progress made in restructuring the group and in improving its product range. Because of the slump in foreign business, the export share of turnover dropped to 60 per cent from 70 per cent. Mr Kummer expressed optimism about 1992 after a 15 per cent rise in orders in the first quarter. He hoped the company would be able to resume dividends this year on the basis of 'a markedly improved profit situation'.</p>

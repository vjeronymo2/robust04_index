			<p><P> October 25, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A HOT NIGHTSPOT;  </P> <P> BOB HOPE HELPS OPEN USO CLUB IN HISTORIC BUILDING  </P> <P> A Navy man spent most of a recent Friday night watching a horror movie and  eating popcorn. A friend downstairs shot pool while another tested his skill at  video games. And a fourth spent much of the evening chatting with a female  volunteer over Cokes and candy bars.  </P> <P> "This is a nice place," said Kenny Lattin, 30, one of the four sailors. "It's a  homey place to relax and feel comfortable." Lattin, a hospital corpsman from  Lawton, Okla., is stationed aboard the USS Mount Vernon, an amphibious assault  vessel, in Long Beach.  </P> <P> Welcome to the newest nightspot in town. Nearly two years behind schedule, the  famed Bob Hope Hollywood USO Club has finally reopened, with a slightly revised  name, in a historic building in downtown Long Beach.  </P> <P> Earlier this week, the grand old comedian himself was on Pine Avenue to  participate in the hoopla surrounding the facility, renamed the Long Beach Bob  Hope USO Club. "I think it's marvelous," he said Monday. "This is a very hot  spot for the USO. This is where the Navy is."  </P> <P> Among other things, Hope announced that he would be traveling to the Persian  Gulf soon to stage Christmas shows for U.S. troops there, although he will have  to change his act to make it acceptable to Arab censors.  </P> <P> "How am I going to go without the girls?" he said, referring to the platoon of  starlets that usually accompany his tours. "I'd hate to think I was the only  pretty face there."  </P> <P> Hope's career as one of the country's best-known funny men is inexorably tied  to the history of the USO, which stands for United Services Organization.  Founded in 1941, the Hollywood club became a model for the chain of USO clubs  chartered by Congress to serve the needs of the nation's military by providing  drop-in centers around the world and traveling shows such as those featuring  Hope.  </P> <P> The first of its kind in the nation, the Hollywood club reached its zenith  during World War II when young soldiers and sailors showed up there by the  thousands to rub elbows with famous movie stars serving as entertainers, coffee  servers and dance partners.  </P> <P> Then the war ended and the neighborhood began to change. With the proliferation  of other entertainment facilities throughout the region, fewer and fewer  military people -- most of whom were based near Long Beach or in Orange County  -- were willing to make the trek to Hollywood. By the 1980s, the Hollywood club  shared a block with a club featuring nude dancers, and began to lose its  reputation for providing a wholesome environment capable of attracting a new  generation of military people.  </P> <P> In September, 1988, the Greater Los Angeles Area USO announced that it was  closing shop in Hollywood and moving to the Pacific Coast Club building,  formerly a Masonic Temple, in downtown Long Beach. The move, they said, would  make the club readily accessible to the estimated 30,000 military personnel  stationed at the several major military installations in the greater Long Beach  area.  </P> <P> But the reopening has been a long time coming. USO officials faced unexpected  delays in obtaining required permits from the city, difficulties in finding a  contractor and a pay dispute with the architect hired to draw the plans.  Officials initially had hoped to open in December, 1988, but the opening was  postponed repeatedly.  </P> <P> As a result, the organization recorded a 45% decline in contributions -- a  major source of financial support. Officials said they feared the nonprofit  organization's future was in jeopardy.  </P> <P> This month's opening, however, seems to have put a light at the end of the  tunnel.  </P> <P> "We're back in the swing of things," said Dewey Smith, the organization's  president. With the club now open, he said, would-be donors feel more confident  in supporting the USO's work. "Our financial situation is better. We have  fund-raisers scheduled and donations coming in. We're visible now and the word  is getting out."  </P> <P> To help lure people to the club, USO officials say they have added a number of  services more relevant to the needs of today's military personnel. Compared to  their counterparts of World War II, the officials say, the new generation of  military recruits tends to be older, better educated, less transient and more  likely to be married.  </P> <P> The new features include a special telephone "warm line" for latchkey military  children, an employment resource center to help find jobs, and a reference  service for such things as child care, counseling and entertainment.  </P> <P> Capitalizing on the public's renewed interest in military matters since the  Persian Gulf crisis, the USO recently conducted areawide campaigns that brought  in thousands of letters, shampoo bottles and paperback books for U.S. forces  stationed in Saudi Arabia. It also distributed hundreds of copies of a coloring  book explaining the deployment to the children of military people involved.  </P> <P> But the heart of the local organization remains its drop-in club, a three-story  5,100-square-foot facility that is open free of charge to anyone bearing a  military ID. Surrounded by decor of red, white or blue, young soldiers and  sailors can watch television, drink nonalcoholic beverages, eat homemade  cookies, read magazines, shoot pool, play video games or just hang out and  relax with their friends.  </P> <P> The club, at 230 Pine Ave., is open Monday through Friday from 2 to 10 p.m.,  and on Saturdays from 6 to 10 p.m.  </P> <P> Special theme nights include televised football on Mondays, checkers Tuesdays  and movies with popcorn every Wednesday. The club also features Bart Simpson  night on Thursdays, during which patrons watch the popular television program  and eat Butterfinger candy bars. Friday is "chips ahoy" poker night. In  addition, the USO is planning special dances and parties for Halloween,  Oktoberfest and Christmas.  </P> <P> Since opening Oct. 1, said Marsha Goodale, club director, the facility has  attracted an average of 10 to 15 service people a night, or about 90 a week.  Once word of the new club spreads, she said, she hopes to serve as many as 350  a week.  </P> <P> That number is far short of the 2,000-per-week predicted by USO officials when  they first announced the move two years ago, a fact Smith, the president, now  attributes to the inflated projections of a former director. "People get  (overly) optimistic sometimes," he said. "The director at that time probably  felt that the club would be larger."  </P> <P> Numbers, however, seemed of little concern to the handful of sailors gathered  for an evening at the club last Friday.  </P> <P> "I come to get away from the stress (of Navy life)," said Donald Ostling, 22, a  boatswain's mate on the battleship Missouri. "I come to relax and think so that  I can plan (my future.)"  </P> <P> Said Aaron Thompkins, 29, a hospital corpsman from New York City: "I think (the  club is) good. It helps guys who are new to the area get into something besides  trouble."  </P></p>

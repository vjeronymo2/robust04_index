			<p>BFN     [Text] On the afternoon of 30 March, at the anticorruption  work conference held by the provincial government, Zhao Zhihao,  deputy secretary of the provincial party committee and governor  of the province, mobilized all government organs in the province  to oppose corruption and advocate administrative honesty in a  profound, sustained, and even more effective way, with a focus  on the three tasks.    After fully affirming the achievements scored by the  province  in opposing corruption, Zhao Zhihao pointed out: This year, the  task on maintaining stability is extremely arduous, and  corruption is one of the major factors affecting stability.  Failing to effectively punish and check corruption will cause  complaints among the masses, is liable to provoke disturbances,  and will affect overall stability. For this reason, all  departments at all levels, principal leading comrades in  particular, must have a full understanding of anticorruption  work, keep sober-minded, and guard against negligence and  slackness.    Zhao Zhihao stressed: The priorities for this year's  anticorruption work are to make leading cadres administratively  honest and self-disciplined, to investigate and deal with  related cases, and to correct unhealthy trends. All departments  at all levels should strengthen the supervision by the masses,  by the press, and by special organs, and should consciously  subject themselves to supervision by people's deputies and  members of Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference,  with a focus on resolving the prominent problems of their own  units, in accordance with the new contents and new demands set  by the three tasks and in line with their respective realities.  Governments at all levels and all leading cadres should not  only take the lead in being self- disciplined but also pay  attention to opposing corruption and support functional  departments perform duties and do their work well.    The conference was presided over by Zhang Ruifeng, vice  governor of the province. Attending the conference were Tan  Fude, standing committee member of the provincial party  committee and secretary of the provincial discipline inspection  commission; Wang Jiangong, vice governor of the province; and  Han Bangju and Ma Changgui, special advisers to the provincial  government.</p>

			<p>920505 FT  05 MAY 92 / Survey of Danish Shipping and Shipbuilding (4): The new alliances - A look at the companies' prospects THE BASIC conditions for operating shipping under the Danish flag are good. The main worry now is that freight markets are weak, says Mr Peter Bjerregaard, managing director of the Danish Shipowners' Association. Mr Bjerregaard's remarks are reflected in statements from the companies in their 1991 annual reports. There is, in particular, considerable excess capacity in the world container liner business, and this has led over the past year to several new co-operation agreements between shipping companies in an effort to rationalise services. For the companies, rationalising means that every ship should carry as many containers as possible. The big Danish operators have been much involved in these new alliances. A. P. Moller's Maersk Line entered into co-operation with the American company Sea Land last year in the Pacific, where these two companies have a combined market share of around 20 per cent. The co-operation involves a container slot charter arrangement. Both companies, however, maintain their own marketing systems and door- to-door delivery systems. At sea, the arrangement means better utilisation of tonnage. There are more direct sailings from the main ports, shorter transit times (which reduces storage time), fewer port calls and co-ordinated use of feeder services. It adds up to a better services at lower costs without requiring new investment. In Europe, Maersk has joined forces with P&amp;O to improve services between Europe and the Middle East by a new service that is due to start operation later this month. Maersk is also one of the 12 shipping companies which recently announced a new system designed to reduce losses on North Atlantic trade. The East Asiatic Company, which operates 33 container vessels in liner services in the Pacific, between Europe and south-east Asia, and between Australia and Asian ports, also operates co-operation agreements on all its main routes. In 1991 it established a new co-operation with Scotland's Ben Lines under the name EACBen, for transport between Europe and south-east Asia, in which EAC has a 66 per cent share. The service, operated out of EAC's UK headquarters at Sevenoaks, Kent, involves nine vessels and weekly sailings. This year a link was established with America's Atlantic Container Lines for the transport of US freight to south-east Asia via Europe on EACBen vessels. While prospects for 1992 are regarded with some misgivings by the shipping companies, their 1991 results were good, though varying considerably over the year (some types of transport benefited from the Gulf War) and between different types of ship. The A. P. Moller shipping group, officially known as Tankers and Liners in Partnership (it is a partnership between APM's twin parent companies, D/S Svendborg and D/S 1912), reported an increase in turnover from DKr16.82bn in 1990 to DKr20.18bn in 1991. Gross profits (profits before depreciation) increased from DKr1.71bn to DKr2.32bn. The year's investments in shipping totalled a colossal DKr5.3bn. APM predicted in its preliminary statement on 1991 results that this year's results were likely to be significantly below those of last year. The East Asiatic Company's transport division, which at the end of 1991 operated 33 container vessels, 11 product carriers and 18 bulk carriers, increased turnover from DKr3.55bn to DKr4.50bn and gross profits from DKr587m to DKr925m. An 'unsatisfactory' result is forecast for 1992 as a consequence of falling freight transport from south-east Asia to Europe. J. Lauritzen Shipping increased turnover from DKr2.35bn to DKr2.82bn and gross profits from DKr440m to DKr591m, and the Lauritzen Group's other transport company, DFDS, operator of Scandinavian Seaways on the North Sea, increased turnover from DKr5.04bn to DKr5.33bn and profits (after net financial items) from DKr111m to Dkr150m.</p>

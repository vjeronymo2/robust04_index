			<p>941201 FT  01 DEC 94 / Survey of Management Buy-Outs (11): How miners chose to go it alone - Case study / Goitra Tower Anthracite Miners at the Tower pit in south Wales had long suspected that managers there wanted to launch a buy-out. But when closure came earlier this year no bid materialised. The response of more than 200 miners was to organise their own bid, an employee buy-out. Last month they were chosen as the government's preferred bidder for the pit in readiness for an expected handover of the assets on Christmas eve. The miners will have virtually the whole of Wales willing them to succeed. The region was once one of the coal capitals of the UK but Tower was British Coal's last deep mine operating in the region when it closed in April. Until the buy-out team took an interest there was a danger that deep mining would be lost to the region for ever. Tower pit itself was first sunk in the 1930s. Assuming the bid is successful it will be quite a coup. The miners will have persuaded both financial backers and government that they are capable of making a success out of a mine for which British Coal said there were not enough markets. Neither the government nor the buy-out team will discuss the size of the bid but it is thought to be worth considerably more than the Pounds 2m that the men have raised by putting in Pounds 8,000 each. Winning the government's backing as preferred bidder for the pit was a considerable achievement. At least one other company put in a tender. Ministers had always said they wanted workers to have a stake in the future of the industry and were known to want to encourage buy-outs. However, employee buy-outs are often considered to be riskier ventures than management buy-outs. The government would not do a deal with the buy-out unless there was a strong chance of running the pit successfully. It will look bad for the government if any of the companies chosen to run the industry after privatisation should fail, but more particularly if the company has been founded with the money of its employees. Failure is not something which Goitra Tower Anthracite, as the buy-out company is called, believes is remotely possible. Tyrone O'Sullivan, secretary of National Union of Mineworkers lodge at Tower when it closed, says Tower made operating profits of Pounds 28m in the last three years. He says the company will aim to produce 430,000 tonnes of coal a year and it has markets for all of it. Some three quarters of the output is expected to go to the domestic market where profit margins are high. Goitra also believes that costs will be much cheaper than in British Coal even though pay for each of the miners will, according to Mr O'Sullivan, be higher and working methods similar. 'Management levels will be more sensible,' he says. 'In British Coal days there were about 50 managers,' he says. 'We will have nothing like that.' But in an employee buy-out, who will do the managing? Are there dangers of a conflict of interest? Mrs Caroline Price, senior corporate finance manager at Price Waterhouse, which has advised Goitra on the bid, says there is a clearly defined management structure. 'Employees will have two hats. They can vote at the annual general meeting but on a day-to-day basis they will be employees. They understand very well the need for discipline and often point out that in a mine it can be a matter of life and death.' Goitra has appointed Cliff Jones, ex manager of the Betws pit, also in south Wales, as pit manager. He will be one of three management directors on the board, along with Tony Shott, mine surveyor. The third will be a finance director who is being appointed from outside the coal industry. There will also be two workers' directors, including Mr O'Sullivan. The chairman of the board will be Philip Weekes, a former director of the National Coal Board in South Wales. He first came into contact with miners at Tower 35 years ago.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- LEADING DEBT ARRANGERS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1 January 1990 - 30 September 1994                            Number   Total Debt    Average Value                                      Pounds m   of Debt (Pounds m)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Bank of Scotland             86       1,545            18 NatWest                      45       1,281            28 Midland/Samuel Montagu       36         554            15 Barclays/BZW                 28         374            13 Royal Bank of Scotland       13         235            18 Morgan Grenfell               8         429            54 Lloyds                        6         114            19 N M Rothschild                4          59            15 Bankers Trust                 3         262            87 3i                            3          17             6 Socit Gnrale                  2         320           160 Bank of America               2         114            57 Union Bank of Switzerland     2         113            57 Coutts &amp; Co                   2          94            47 Swiss Bank Corporation        2          63            32 Chemical Bank                 2          37            19 Continental Bank              2          32            16 Kleinwort Benson              2          29            15 Bank of Ireland               2          19            10 Ulster Investment Bank        2          12             6 TSB                           2          10             5 Banque Indosuez               2           8             4 Others                       20         801            40 None/Not Known/(Duplication) (7)       (931)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Total                       269       5,591            21  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Qualification: Pounds 10 million plus deals, acted in two or more Source: KPMG Corporate Finance, October 1, 1994  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- LEADING MEZZANINE ARRANGERS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1 January 1990 - 30 September 1994                                         Total      Average                        Number of    Mezzanine     Value of                            Deals     Pounds m    Mezzanine                                                   Pounds m  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 3i                            17         59            4 Intermediate Capital          15        198           13 NatWest Ventures               9         50            6 Legal &amp; General/Mithras        7         66            9 First Britannia                4         42           11 Samuel Montagu                 4         20            5 Chase Manhatten                3          4            8 Kleinwort Benson               3         19            6 Morgan Grenfell                3         16            5 Phildrew Ventures              3          9            3 Others                        27        208            8 None/Not Known/(Duplication)  (6)       (68)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Total                         89        643            7  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Qualification: Pounds 10 million plus deals, acted in three or more Source: KPMG Corporate Finance, October 1, 1994  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

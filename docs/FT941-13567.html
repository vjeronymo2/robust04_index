			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Tring settles copyright dispute with EMI Tring International, the budget price compact disc company, has agreed to pay Pounds 20,000 to EMI Music, which had sued it for breach of copyright. The British Phonographic Industry, which represents UK music companies, said the payment settled cases of alleged breach of copyright of recordings by Olivia Newton John and of Puccini's La Boheme. The company still faces legal action for breach of copyright from other music groups, including PolyGram and MCA. Ms Sara John, BPI's director of legal affairs, said Tring had agreed to pay Pounds 10,000 for each of the alleged copyright violations and EMI had accepted that. She added: 'The message is clear: all companies involved in the issuing of back catalogue recordings must be extremely careful about their licensing arrangements. If there is not a system in place for monitoring licences, there should be. The BPI and its members will continue to pursue vigorously any further breaches of copyright such as this.' Tring said: 'The financial impact of the litigation is not material to the group. However, we are extremely pleased to have resolved all matters with EMI.' Tring postponed its stock market flotation last year, citing the weakness of the new issue market, but said it planned to go ahead with a listing in the first quarter of 1994. The company expects to make pre-tax profits of more than Pounds 5m in the year to March 31 1994. Mr Alan Wheatley, a former chairman of venture capital group 3i who had agreed to be chairman of the company, has withdrawn. The company now intends to appoint Mr Tony Morris, a former vice president of PolyGram International.</p>

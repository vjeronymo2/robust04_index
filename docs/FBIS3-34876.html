Asif  Ali Zardari went to Iraq as a special emissary of the prime  minister with a consignment of medicines and a letter for  President Saddam Husayn, where he was accorded an enthusiastic  welcome. He went to seek the release of three Pakistani  prisoners, but he found out in Baghdad that 24 Pakistanis were  serving jail terms on various charges in that country. The  Iraqi authorities, on Zardari's request, tracked down all  Pakistani prisoners and released them immediately. Now, only  one Pakistani remains in an Iraqi jail. He is accused of being  involved in political activities. When Asif Ali Zardari  returned to Islamabad with eight of the released prisoners, the  prime minister received them at the airport, thanked the Iraqi  Government, and noted that the purpose of sending a special  emissary to Baghdad has been fulfilled. The release of the  Pakistanis and their return at the beginning of the holy month  of Ramadan is a source of happiness and joy for the country.  Efforts will be made to ensure early release of the lone  Pakistani now held in Iraq. She said we are doing all this for  the sake of Pakistan's glory and honor at the international  level and to raise our voice in support of truth and justice.  We hope the opposition will also cooperate with the government  in this regard. The prime minister has rightly said that the  return of the eight released Pakistanis will bring happiness to  their homes and that a man feels especially happy when he puts  his feet on the soil of his motherland.    In reply to a question about whether Pakistan will help Iraq  restore its contacts with the rest of the world, the prime  minister said Pakistan and other countries should work to ensure  the territorial integrity and independence of Kuwait, so that  post-Gulf War conditions can reach a logical conclusion.  Pakistan has maintained traditional relations with Iraq, and we  want to restore our ties in accordance with the UN resolutions  and the international situation that emerged after the Gulf War.  We will do all this within the limits set by the United  Nations. Vital nations always take care of their nationals no  matter which part of the world they live in. They provide  assistance to their nationals whenever they find themselves  surrounded by difficulties or problems and do not rest until  their problems are solved. They consider this a matter of  national ego and honor and are ready to place everything at  stake to mitigate their suffering. It is not possible for them  to ignore their citizens. There are numerous examples to show  that a nation has either declared war against or severed all  ties with other countries in order to have one or two of its  citizens released. The present government has set a good  example in this respect. It has enhanced the prestige of the  country and the nation at the international level. Within the  country, it has brought relief and comfort to the families whose  relatives had been separated from them and nobody had ever  thought of their release and repatriation.    We already had diplomatic ties with Iraq and now an element  of warmth has been added to them. Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto  has referred to the limitations and restrictions imposed by the  United Nations, which we need to observe in view of our  commitment to the world body. Nonetheless, Pakistan can  certainly play an effective role in restoring Iraq's ties with  the rest of the world and it must do so. Normalization of  Iraq's ties with the international community will create a sort  of stability in the entire region and will help establish and  promote international contacts on the basis of mutual respect.  Iraq's participation will prove particularly useful in efforts  toward achieving the collective objectives of the Islamic  countries.    Addressing a news conference on his return from Baghdad,  Asif  Ali Zardari disclosed that the Iraqi Government is pleased with  our humanitarian gesture. Iraq was in great need of the  medicines we provided. Several people have died in Iraq because  of a shortage and nonavailability of medicines and the common  people are facing serious difficulties finding food and  medicines as a result of restrictions imposed by the United  Nations. Asif Ali Zardari said that he had the impression that  Iraq would have been destroyed, like Bosnia, as a result of  120,000 tons of bombs that were dropped on that country during  the Gulf War, but the Iraqis have rebuilt everything in just two  years. It has been confirmed from other sources as well that  Iraq has erased all signs of destruction just one year after the  war, intentionally leaving a few places in their ruined state as  war memorials. No other areas bear any sign of destruction  caused by the war. Zardari said that the Government of Iraq has  requested that Pakistan send medicines. The request should be  considered sympathetically and an appeal should be made to the  United Nations to lift restrictions on the supply of medicines  and foodstuffs to Iraq on humanitarian grounds. Pakistan's  efforts in this context will certainly bear fruit. As for the  dispatch of medicines, there is no restriction in this regard.    Pakistan and Iraq enjoy age-old ties. They have interacted  and cooperated with each other under various agreements and,  hence, a close and harmonious relationship must be established  between them. Iraq is full of oil wealth and can provide oil to  Pakistan on concessional terms. Trade between the two countries  can also prove mutually beneficial. Anyhow, as stated by the  prime minister, Pakistan's ties with Iraq can be restored only  within the limits set by the United Nations. Iraq appreciates  Pakistan's humanitarian gesture. Pakistan should also  appreciate Iraq's goodwill gesture and thus the two countries  should once again become each other's helper and supporter and  prove a source of strength for the Islamic world.</p>

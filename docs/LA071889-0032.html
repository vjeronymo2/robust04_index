			<p><P> July 18, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING BRIEFING: TRUTH IS, YOU HAVE TO SEE IT TO BELIEVE IT  </P> <P> Were the Dean brothers as zany as their nicknames, Dizzy and Daffy? Some say  they weren't, but Grantland Rice told of a time Daffy was swigging on a soda  pop as a train carrying the St. Louis Cardinals entered a long tunnel.  </P> <P> Rice said he overheard this exchange between the brothers:  </P> <P> Daffy: "Diz, you tried any of this stuff?"  </P> <P> Dizzy: "Just fixin' to. Why?"  </P> <P> Daffy: "Don't! I did, and I've gone plumb blind."  </P> <P> Fair or foul?: Wrote Mike Littwin of the Baltimore Sun after Baltimore's Mike  Devereaux hit the disputed homer that beat the Angels Saturday night: "Home  Team Sports showed the replay at least nine times. Slo-mo. Reverse angle.  Center-field camera. Underlined. Circled. Minicam. Late-night thrill cam. It  still looked foul."  </P> <P> Say what?: From Pete Rose, making like Norm Crosby: "All I want is for the case  to be heard in front of a impractical decision-maker."  </P> <P> Shame, shame: From Tom Powers of the St. Paul Pioneer Press Dispatch: "How dumb  are the radio guys? When a Los Angeles radio station got word over the wires  that Bo Jackson of the Royals had to leave a game early with a strained thigh  muscle, its representative called the K.C. press box to ask if Jackson would be  able to return to the game later. Obviously a football-oriented station."  </P> <P> Trivia time: What do Pedro Guerrero, Rick Dempsey and Ray Knight have in  common? (Answer below.)  </P> <P> Power outage: Deion Sanders is hitting only .239 at triple-A Columbus and has  been fined more than once by Manager Bucky Dent for being late and not running  out ground balls.  </P> <P> Said Marty Noble of Newsday: "We've all seen storefronts with flawed neon signs  -- you know, with a letter or two missing. Could it be that Neon Deion is  suffering from that problem?"  </P> <P> For all seasons: Headline in the Cleveland Plain Dealer after the Cavaliers  drafted Seton Hall guard John Morton: "Cavaliers Think Morton Worth His Salt."  </P> <P> Tunnel vision: The subject was concentration and Orel Hershiser told John  McGrath of the Denver Post: "Last year during the seventh game of the National  League playoffs, when I came out to pitch the top of the ninth, I got all  caught up in the scene instead of the batter. I mean, there was a standing  ovation for me and everything. So what'd I do? I threw the first pitch and hit  the batter, Lee Mazzilli. That taught me a lesson. Always keep your game face  on."  </P> <P> Are you ready?: The latest from Chris Berman, ESPN's dispenser of nicknames:  Greg (Life Is A) Cadaret.  </P> <P> Trivia answer: All three were World Series most valuable players. Guerrero  shared the honor with Dodger teammates Ron Cey and Steve Yeager.  </P> <P> Quotebook Chi Chi Rodriguez, senior golfer, to a partner who landed an approach  shot below a steep ridge: "If you dig deep enough there, you might find Jimmy  Hoffa."  </P></p>

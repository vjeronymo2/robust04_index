			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / Letter: Innovation the answer to competitive pressures Sir, While we obviously have sympathy with Titan Forge and Cornwell &amp; O'Neil (UK News, gate-painting photo caption, August 12), the situation they and many more British businesses are now being forced to face has long been the reality among our international competitors. In Japan, for instance, inflationary price increases have been almost impossible for a number of years due to the intense local competition. Nevertheless, employees have become used to annual pay increases of almost double the 2 to 3 per cent inflation rate. Management has had to adopt two main survival routes - to innovate, hence commanding better margins for a short period, and to reduce costs/increase productivity. This really forces a proactive management style, and survival of the fittest among the middle and lower size companies that make up the majority of the market. The extra problem in Europe at the moment is of course the high cost of money. This is a major deflationary factor which has to be addressed by the EC as a whole, not just the UK. When recently applied in Japan, higher interest rates not only cooled an overheating economy, but drastically reduced growth which will cause further deflationary problems for some time to come.

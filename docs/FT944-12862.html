			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / Malaysia sect leader freed The Malaysian leader of an Islamic sect called deviationist by the authorities has been freed from jail in Kuala Lumpur. Mr Ashaari Muhammad, head of the Al Arqam sect, had been jailed without trial since early September. Al Arqam, which claims more than 100,000 followers in Malaysia and more overseas, was banned in August. Mr Ashaari recently appeared on TV saying he regretted straying from the true path of Islam. But many Al Arqam members say he was forced by police to make his confession. Malaysian authorities say Mr Ashaari's release is conditional. It is believed he will remain under house arrest.</p>

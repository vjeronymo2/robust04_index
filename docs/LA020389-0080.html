			<p><P> February 3, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUYOUT FIRMS SLASH R&amp;D SPENDING, SURVEY SHOWS  </P> <P> Companies involved in restructuring or leveraged buyouts cut back on research  and development in 1987 while most other companies increased their spending,  according to the National Science Foundation's annual survey of industrial  R&amp;D.  </P> <P> Also, the companies reduced their research and development staffs, according to  the report, which was released Thursday.  </P> <P> The report may give added ammunition to critics who question the long-term  competitiveness of companies involved in mergers, LBOs and other corporate  restructurings. The report comes at a time Congress is considering legislation  that would discourage LBOs, which are takeovers financed by debt to be repaid  from the target company's future earnings or from selling off assets.  </P> <P> "Both federal and industrial research support are important pillars for our  nation's economic competitiveness," Erich Bloch, NSF director, said in a  statement. "Any factor that causes reductions in research weakens our  industries' ability to compete internationally," he added.  </P> <P> The NSF said its survey looked at 200 companies that together account for  almost 90% of U.S. industrial research and development spending. Sixteen  companies were identified as having recently been involved in a merger. Eight  others were involved in leveraged buyouts, stock buybacks or major  restructurings to avoid becoming targets of takeovers. Those eight companies  reduced R&amp;D spending 12.8% between 1986 and 1987, the NSF said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Many Industries Affected  </P> <P> The 24 companies together reduced R&amp;D spending 5.3% for the same period,  while the other companies in the group of 200 reported a 5.4% increase, the NSF  said.  </P> <P> The foundation said mergers, acquisitions and other restructurings had a  dampening effect on the R&amp;D performance of various industries. Six of the  16 companies that had merged were in the transportation industry, the NSF said,  adding that those companies reduced R&amp;D spending 5.5%. In the chemicals  industry (including pharmaceuticals), companies affected by mergers,  acquisitions or other restructurings reduced R&amp;D spending 4.5%. In  contrast, the report said the rest of the industry reported a 9.8% increase in  spending.  </P> <P> Some observers, however, questioned whether the survey's results should  necessarily be viewed negatively without knowing more about the companies  surveyed. William G. Ouchi, a professor of management at UCLA's Anderson  Graduate School of Management, said the transportation companies cited --  presumably including the recent airline mergers -- may have found duplicated  efforts.  </P> <P> Also, some "companies may not have been very efficiently managed. It could have  been that their research labs had a lot of people doing nothing."  </P> <P> The NSF report "bears some research" on which companies were studied, said  Douglas K. Le Bon, a vice president at Wilshire Associates of Santa Monica and  consultant to pension funds investing in LBOs. "Just because B follows A  doesn't mean A causes B," he said.  </P> <P> Companies that are subjects of LBOs tend to be in mature industries such as  retailing and food processing, with relatively low R&amp;D expenditures to  begin with, he said. Lenders and investors want companies with stable cash  flows and earnings that will be best positioned to repay large debts incurred  in the deals, he said.  </P> <P> Le Bon added that firms acquired through LBOs will also tend to sell off units  involved in heavy R&amp;D spending, since those units are most likely to have  the least stable cash flows and earnings. That could account for any decline in  R&amp;D spending at those firms.  </P> <P> "If you look for pieces to divest, you divest pieces that are susceptible to  technology swings, since those companies have greater risks," Le Bon said.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Bill Sing contributed to this story.  </P></p>

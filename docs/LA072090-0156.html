			<p><P> July 20, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LEE ATWATER TAPS FRIEND AS GOP'S CHIEF SPOKESMAN  </P> <P> Republican Party Chairman Lee Atwater today named his best friend as chief  spokesman for the party, saying the GOP needs a high-profile presence that he  cannot provide while he is fighting a brain tumor.  </P> <P> The new spokesman, Charles Black, is a partner in the political consulting firm  Black, Manafort, Stone &amp; Kelly.  </P> <P> Since the discovery of Atwater's brain tumor in March, Black has been actively  advising the Republican National Committee and President Bush.  </P> <P> There have been increasing grumblings within the party, however, that with the  clever and tenacious Atwater on the sidelines, the GOP has lost the offensive  to the Democrats on issues such as taxes, the savings and loan disaster and  civil rights.  </P> <P> Atwater's chief of staff, Mary Matalin, has been handling day-to-day committee  operations, and most party insiders have praised her operation.  </P> <P> But some say that Matalin lacks the clout of Atwater and that White House Chief  of Staff John H. Sununu has been making too many major political decisions  without enough advice from others.  </P></p>

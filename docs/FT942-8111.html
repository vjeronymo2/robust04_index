			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / Books: Meditations of the sage for today - JDF Jones reviews an anthology of the work of Sir Laurens van der Post FEATHER FALL: AN ANTHOLOGY by Laurens van der Post Chatto &amp; Windus Pounds 16.99, 269 pages Sir Laurens van der Post is not so far short of 90 but, happily, in full possession of his powers as he celebrates this 60th anniversary of his association with the Hogarth Press (today subsumed in Chatto, and in turn in Random House). This attendant anthology, Feather Fall, is a slightly curious concept because one has to question its function. Is it to commemorate the occasion? To remind us fans of his qualities? To give to new readers a taste which will encourage them to buy the real books? Perhaps the model is the anthology of CG Jung - van der Post's mentor - which has led many casual readers to tackle Jung's fuller achievement. After all, it is hard to imagine an anthology from, say, Conrad, or Bellow, or Hemingway (successful publishing projects like The Essential Hemingway are not comparable because they are omnibuses, not anthologies). The explanation is that van der Post is seen today not so much as a novelist - although he is a good one - but as a thinker, visionary, philosopher, mystic. You cannot sensibly anthologise a novelist but you can much more easily gather together a collection of extracts, often brief, even a single paragraph, from the life-work of a sage. The danger is that, as a result of abbreviation, you can finish up with too many out-of-context mini-extracts which do less than justice to the author: for instance, 'Never try to go ahead of your spoor. Many a man has died because he has not observed the discipline of the spoor to the end'. That sort of example, and there are quite a few of them here, would keep Private Eye happy for months. As with all van der Post's regular appearances in that journal, it is very unfair but undeniably funny. Another problem with a book of this sort is that it cannot - because these are snippets] - communicate the achievement of a creative writer. It needs to be insisted that the early van der Post novels - In A Province, The Face Beside The Fire, Flamingo Feather - are still splendid. The African travel books - Venture to the Interior, The Lost World of the Kalahari, The Heart of the Hunter - continue to defy the sneers of the anthropologists. A Story Like The Wind and A Far-Off Place are a captivating duo about childhood and much else. Even the food book, First Catch Your Eland, is hard to put down. And that is to leave out The Dark Eye in Africa, The Seed and the Sower, the travels to Russia and Japan, the recent semi-memoirs, and so much more. The editors of Feather Fall, Jean-Marc Pottiez and Jane Bedford, focus on van der Post not as novelist or traveller, soldier or crypto-diplomat, but as - to use Rosamond Lehmann's words about him - 'a great spiritual thinker and writer'. They correctly see 'a pattern in his writing, a flow and a continuity' over 60 years, or at least over the 40 years since he resumed his writing career after returning from the war in the Far East. That pattern is underlined by the fact that he has never hesitated to repeat himself: again and again his books, whether ostensibly fiction or non-fiction, return to themes and episodes from his early Afrikaner childhood, his Bushman nanny, his Huguenot ancestry, his early youthful visit to Japan, his experiences as a POW, his subsequent travels in Africa, his acquaintance with Jung, and so on. Inevitably and properly, these topics are re-visited in this volume, together with his lifelong meditation on the mighty themes that go with them  -the dark shadow within ourselves, the function of journey for each of us, the significance of the Bushman as the 'first man', the religious role of Wilderness, the necessity to forgive, the Jungian sense of 'wholeness', the mystery of Dream. Too many of these extracts, in my opinion, are taken from that odd volume A Walk with a White Bushman, which is not a real van der Post book but a rambling and disorganised conversation with Jean-Marc Pottiez. I am also struck by a change in style over the years: I am convinced that at some point the taut, elegant pace of, say, Venture to the Interior, turned into the very different rhythm, a tendency to spin words and lose precision, of the later books. (I assume he started to dictate, which is never a good thing.) Van der Post has been active in Southern African affairs for many years though he has chosen to operate sub rosa. His disdain for apartheid was never a secret, nor - more controversially - his opposition to the international sanctions which surely contributed to recent events. I particularly enjoyed his unwitting reference here to the Afrikaners' history 'which still has a half-Nelson hold on them'. Fresh from a visit to Johannesburg, and full of images of inauguration of majority rule, I was also struck by his understanding - dating back to his years as prisoner of the Japanese - of the surprising possibility of forgiveness. 'Persons who have really suffered at the hands of others do not find it difficult to forgive, nor even to understand the people who caused their suffering,' he once wrote. 'They do not find it difficult to forgive because out of suffering and sorrow truly endured comes an instinctive sense of privilege . . .' He went on, in a later novel, 'For if one does not forgive, one does not understand, and if one does not understand, one is afraid, and if one is afraid, one hates, and if one hates, one cannot love. And no new beginning on earth is possible without love . . .' I should like to think that those two elderly South Africans, Laurens van der Post and Nelson Mandela, might have something to say to each other when they are next in the same town.</p>

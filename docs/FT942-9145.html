			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / International Bonds: Finland opts for French franc sector with 10-year offering The Republic of Finland's FFr6bn offering of 10-year Eurobonds dominated an enlivened session in the Eurobond primary market yesterday. The issue was priced to yield 32 basis points above the 5.5 per cent French government bond which expires in 2004. Some dealers said the pricing was too tight, and when trading began the spread widened to around 36 basis points. They argued that Finland had paid 11 to 15 basis points over Libor for the funds, which are being kept in French francs, and the borrower could have achieved better terms by issuing in another currency, such as yen or dollars, and swapping into French francs. However, lead manager Paribas said that swap spreads are very tight and such arbitrage opportunities are virtually non-existent. Mr Veikko Kantola, Finland's director of finance, said he had considered various European currencies but opted for the Euro-French franc sector as it looked the most attractive after last week's flurry of European interest rate cuts. He added that the pricing of yesterday's issue showed that Finland's standing in the market was continuing to improve. 'The last (French) franc deal nearly two years ago carried a 41-point spread,' he said. According to Mr Kantola, Finland is expected to raise the equivalent of Dollars 7bn this year because of the recovery in the country's economy. This compares with Dollars 11.5bn in 1992 and Dollars 8.5bn last year. Demand for the bonds came mainly from French insurers and European central banks, Paribas said. SNCF, the French state railway company, is expected to launch an offering of FFr2bn to FFr3bn later this week. The dollar was in vogue as GECC, the financing arm of General Electric, issued a Dollars 250m three-year bond priced to yield 10 basis points over US Treasuries. The deal was closely followed by a similar self-led offering from Swiss Bank Corporation. The two issues continued a trend established a month ago by AT&amp;T, the US telecoms giant, and further deals are expected this week. Dealers said yesterday's offerings reflected growing demand for short-dated Eurodollar paper from European retail investors who believe that a further half-point rise in the Federal funds rate has been discounted. SEK, the Swedish export agency, raised a total of Y45bn through two three-year offerings. It is believed to have swapped the proceeds of a Y35bn issue into dollars, achieving a deep sub-Libor funding cost in the process. Joint lead manager Merrill Lynch said Japanese and European investors continued to have a big appetite for yen assets, attracted by the stability in the Japanese bond market and hopes of an appreciation in the yen. More issuers are expected to tap the Euroyen sector this week. Eurofima, the Swiss-based rolling-stock financing organisation, provided a new variation in the recent spate of callable Eurolira bonds. It raised L300bn through an offering of 10-year Eurobonds callable at par after seven years. Joint lead manager Banca Nazionale del Lavoro said that in contrast to recent issues, which were mainly sold to Italian investors, 40 per cent of Eurofima's bonds were placed outside Italy.</p>

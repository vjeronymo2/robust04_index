			<p>930824 FT  24 AUG 93 / Business and the Law: Competition supremo - Robert Rice speaks to Graeme Odgers, head of the UK's Monopolies and Mergers Commission Publication last week of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission's long-awaited reports on British Gas shot Mr Graeme Odgers into the public limelight for the first time in his new role as MMC chairman. Although Mr Odgers arrived at the MMC too late to be closely involved with the report, the generally favourable reaction to the commission's findings has ensured a good start for the Odgers' era. However, it is too early to judge whether the appointment of Mr Odger, an experienced industrialist, will translate into an overall change in approach to competition policy. Mr Odgers' appointment by Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, last December, was generally seen by observers as another step towards a new approach to competition issues. When Mr Heseltine took over at the DTI, he promised a pro-industrial policy, intervening to help British companies 'before breakfast, before lunch, before tea and before dinner'. As an industrialist and the first non-lawyer to head the Commission, Mr Odgers was seen as Mr Heseltine's man. Mr Odgers' industrial credentials made him an ideal candidate for the task of bringing a more pro-industry focus to the work of the commission. At Tarmac, he revived the construction company, increasing turnover from Pounds 85m to Pounds 1.6bn during his seven-year spell. He moved onto British Telecom, first as deputy chairman and chief financial officer and then as group managing director under the chairmanship of Mr Iain Vallance. It was a very difficult time (at BT), says Mr Odgers. The telecommunications group was experiencing widespread problems and after 'struggling manfully' with these for four years, he left suddenly in early 1990, returning to the construction industry as head of Alfred McAlpine. Mr Odgers put his abrupt departure from BT down to 'a clash of management styles' with Mr Vallance. One-on-one relationships are always difficult, he explains, unless there is real understanding and a coincidence of style. 'Perhaps I was too inflexible in some ways in my commitment to decentralisation and in my views about how a business should run to make the relationship work.' Mr Odgers' public sector experience is also thought to have impressed Mr Heseltine. In the early 1970s he spent three years as head of the DTI's industrial development unit. Peter Walker was then trade and industry secretary. But by the time Mr Odgers had taken up his appointment, there had been a change of government and he found himself working for Labour's Tony Benn. The Conservatives saw the IDU as a vehicle for handling regional aid under the Industry Act; but under Mr Benn its role widened and Mr Odgers found himself heading the investigation and negotiation of support deals for lame duck companies such as motor manufacturer British Leyland. 'Heading the IDU in the middle of an industrial crisis and trying to reconcile the political aspirations of one's masters with the industrial and commercial realities of the marketplace was what I call a challenging job,' he says. He found the experience 'riveting'; so much so that when the opportunity of returning to the public sector presented itself - as as head of the MMC - he had little hesitation in accepting. The only hole on his curriculum vitae as far as the MMC job was concerned was the lack of a legal qualification. At the time of his appointment, this lacuna was seen by many as an advantage: Mr Odgers was viewed as a hands-on industrialist prepared to inject some much-needed pragmatism into the legalistic procedures which surround UK competition policy. Three and a half months into the job, Mr Odgers is not so sure. The commission operates within a legal framework, he says; failure to observe the law would result in its decisions being challenged in court. Mr Odgers has therefore been put through a series of tutorials with the Commission's lawyers, which he describes as 'rewarding, but hard work'. So is he Mr Heseltine's man? 'Obviously, given my background, there was no way I was going to approach the job from a legalistic point of view. When looking at the public interest criteria I'm bound to put full weight behind the industrial and commercial considerations.' He is, nevertheless, a firm believer in the importance of competition. 'If you don't have a sound competition environment you're not going to have sound competitive industries.' 'But,' he adds, 'competitiveness - the ability to compete in whatever is the relevant market - is also hugely important.' Does this mean that the enforcement of competition policy must be flexible - that it is pointless having strong competition in local markets if it prevents companies competing on the world stage? 'What I'm saying is that you have to identify what the relevant marketplace is in each case. What you don't want is, in stimulating competition within local and domestic markets, to stop your relevant industry competing in what turns out to be the real marketplace, which may be the European or an interna-tional marketplace. 'Sometimes these conflicts occur and one has to take it into account, no question about it. 'Having said that,' he adds, 'the best stimulus to the creation of strong international competition is a strong competitive framework within your own domestic marketplace. If you don't have it, you'll have soft industry.' Mr Odgers is happiest talking about competition and its relationship to competitiveness. He is less forthright on other issues such as reform of competition law, relations with the European Commission and the structure of the UK competition authorities. He has yet to meet Mr Karel van Miert, EC competition commissioner, but foresees no problems in reaching common ground on a variety of competition issues with his EC counterpart. Nor does Mr Odgers see the need for radical change to the UK law on the abuse of monopoly power - a view shared by his predecessor, Sir Sydney Lipworth. And he is cautious about any change in the relationship between the MMC and the Office of Fair Trading; he welcomes the recently announced government review of the OFT. As an industrialist Mr Odgers is aware of industry complaints about the duplication of effort between the OFT and the MMC and the administrative burdens this places on parties involved in investigations. Mr Odgers would like to streamline and speed-up procedures, but maintains that, if the MMC is to do its job properly, then there are inevitably going to be burdens on industry. The process is, he says, 'a balancing act'. Like his predecessor, Mr Odgers would welcome the appointment of more hands-on industrialists to the MMC but recognises the difficulties many prospective candidates would face in devoting sufficient time to the commission. Barely 100 days into the job, has he changed his views in any way since arriving? He says he had not appreciated the full extent of the difficulties of competition policy. There are all sorts of internal dilemmas and inconsistencies which make any MMC judgment 'so much more difficult than I had originally thought'.</p>

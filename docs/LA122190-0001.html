			<p><P> December 21, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> S.D. JUDGE AGAIN SENTENCES HABITUAL CRIMINAL TO LIFE;  </P> <P> CRIME: RAPIST AND ACCUSED KILLER IS FIRST IN CALIFORNIA TO BE SENTENCED UNDER  LAW AIMED AT REPEAT OFFENDERS.  </P> <P> Slamming the cell doors shut for good, a federal judge Thursday made Warren  James Bland the first person in California to be sentenced to life in prison  without parole under a new law that targets repeat offenders.  </P> <P> U.S. District Judge J. Lawrence Irving imposed the term on Bland, 53, of Los  Angeles, who had been convicted last month of being a repeat felon in  possession of a gun.  </P> <P> Irving had sentenced Bland to the life without parole term last year but was  overturned by a federal appeals court, which ruled he erred by telling jurors  that Bland was wanted in the 1986 killing of a 7-year-old Pasadena girl. At a  second trial last month, a jury convicted Bland of the gun charge -- his 14th  felony conviction -- after deliberating for precisely 10 minutes.  </P> <P> "You have, by virtue of your conduct, inflicted cruel and unusual punishment on  your victims of incalculable proportions, in my view," Irving said Thursday.  </P> <P> Irving said Bland's victims, many of them women and children, had suffered  "horrible trauma." Irving added, "I am convinced beyond any possible doubt that  you must be permanently incarcerated in federal prison. You have earned a  permanent cell in federal prison."  </P> <P> Bland, 53, who has spent 28 of the past 31 years in prison or mental  institutions, remained impassive as Irving imposed the term.  </P> <P> After Bland was convicted last month on the gun charge, Assistant U.S. Atty.  Larry Burns, the prosecutor in the case, said that Bland had become the  "measuring stick for other alleged armed criminal criminals. I hear defense  attorneys comparing their clients to him, saying, 'He's not a Warren Bland,  judge, he's not a Warren Bland.' "  </P> <P> In many respects, the hearing Thursday was a rerun of the August 1989 session  at which Irving first imposed the life without parole term.  </P> <P> At one point, as defense attorney Judy Clarke recited Bland's objections to the  term, conceding that Bland had a "seriously bad record" but contending it was  cruel and unusual punishment to impose a "natural death sentence," Irving said,  "We have been down this road, most of it, before."  </P> <P> As he did last year, Burns urged Irving to impose the no-parole term. He said  Thursday that Irving could "put an end to Mr. Bland's reign of terror, his  ability to victimize people."  </P> <P> "It's time for Mr. Bland to go away and not be among us again," Burns said.  </P> <P> Bland, who spoke last year at length in his defense, declined Thursday to talk.  Irving, who had made his feelings about Bland known last year, was decidedly  more brief Thursday in his comments.  </P> <P> Last year, Irving called Bland a "vicious, incorrigible predator." Because of  Bland's bespectacled, grandfatherly appearance, Irving said, Bland is  "particularly dangerous" and a "wolf in sheep's clothing."  </P> <P> Bland was convicted Nov. 16 under the 4-year-old Armed Career Criminal Act,  which allows repeat offenders arrested while in possession of a firearm to be  sentenced to life without parole.  </P> <P> Bland's first felony offense came in 1957, Burns said. According to court  documents, he has been convicted, among other crimes, of burglary, rape and  kidnaping.  </P> <P> According to court documents, in one three-week period in December, 1959, and  January, 1960, Bland assaulted a 43-year-old woman, a 46-year-old woman, an  18-year-old woman and a fourth woman whose age was not listed. He pleaded  guilty to one count of kidnaping and one count of forcible rape.  </P> <P> In August and November of 1968, about a year after being back on the streets  and while on parole, Bland embarked upon his next series of rapes and assaults,  court documents said. He raped a 28-year-old schoolteacher, then a 31-year-old  woman, then assaulted a 22-year-old woman. The next year he was convicted of  rape, burglary and kidnaping, court documents said.  </P> <P> Paroled in August, 1975, Bland assaulted an 11-year-old girl and her mother in  August, 1976, raping the mother and torturing the girl while trying to rape  her, court documents said. He served three years in prison for assault with  intent to rape and for kidnaping and was released in April, 1980, documents  said.  </P> <P> In December, 1980, according to court documents, he tortured and molested an  11-year-old boy. In July, 1981, he was convicted of three felony counts in  connection with that assault and sentenced to nine years in prison.  </P> <P> He was most recently released from prison in 1986.  </P> <P> In February, 1987, Bland was wounded and arrested by San Diego police and  charged in the torture and murder of 7-year-old Phoebe Ho of South Pasadena,  whose body was found in a Riverside County ditch. She had disappeared while  walking to school in December, 1986. Bland awaits a preliminary hearing in that  case.  </P> <P> Bland also has been named as a suspect in the slayings of 14-year-old Wendy  Osborn of Placentia in Orange County and Ruth M. Ost, 81, of San Diego.  </P> <P> San Diego police had been looking for Bland on the Riverside County warrant.  Officers found a gun in his car.  </P> <P> Bland was then charged under the 1986 federal "career criminal" law with  possession of a gun by a felon with at least three serious convictions.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Military observer Vladimir Klimov "Topical Commentary:" </F> "Where Are Missiles Targeted?"]    [Excerpts] Hamlet's question "To be or not to be?" remains  the main question of the day. I was surely not the only one to  think so on learning that the Russian and U.S. presidents had  announced the detargeting of strategic missiles in the Moscow  declaration.    "For the first time since the beginning of the nuclear era  our countries have stopped targeting missiles at each other,"  Major General Anatoliy Svetikov, deputy chief of the Strategic  Rocket Forces Staff Directorate, believes. [passage omitted]    Yet the past is still with us. The following questions have  arisen from there, from the alarming past: Is the retargeting  of missiles and their return to their former condition possible  and how long would this take? Let us allow the specialist, Maj.  Gen. Svetikov, to speak:    "The process of introducing and scrapping missions operates  on many levels and planes. It varies for different categories  and types of missile. The scrapping of missions will depend on  the principle chosen by the two countries' presidents. As  regards resumption, I can say that as long as a missile is on  alert status there is always a possibility of returning  everything to its former place. How long will this take? Long  enough, although the times vary for different categories and  types of missile. I do not intend to talk about time periods  but have singled out the most important thing: the  implementation of the presidents' decision sharply reduces the  threshold of a nuclear strike."    How nice it would be to put a period after such an  optimistic  conclusion and to exclaim joyfully "The End!" Alas, there is  still a long way to go before the end; dreams about a complete  ban on nuclear weapons still remain dreams. The nuclear danger  comes not from across the ocean but from Russia's doorstep --  Ukraine. Its president pledged to transport nuclear warheads to  us for dismantling. But some of them are already in a critical  condition.    Yet again we have to talk of the unreasonableness of certain  vociferous politicians. Specialists, foreseeing the  complexities with missiles, made an agreement about centralized  maintenance of them. But some Ukrainian deputies saw Moscow's  evil hand in this too. The agreements, which did not need  parliament's ratification, were blocked by it. We, they said,  will overcome.    But how can routine inspection and maintenance work and the  maintenance of missile complexes be undertaken when there are  not enough resources or specialists? The result of the  deputies' veto is the alarming technical condition of missiles  in Ukraine. Following inspection, warheads were removed from  some missile launchers which had simply become dangerous.    Hamlet's question has now crystallized over these missile  silos. How will people answer it?</p>

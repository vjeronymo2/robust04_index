			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of China (30): Migrant labour moves to cities - Over 130m farm workers now 'surplus to requirements' HUDDLED in tightly packed groups around the railway stations of China's urban centres, peasant workers from the countryside wait listlessly for offers of work from city dwellers. Government officials say that about 30m of China's 697m population of working age are employed outside their home provinces, and that about half are skilled manual workers, often in construction. But the World Bank estimates that this 'floating population' may number as many as 120m. In Guangzhou city alone, at the heart of the flourishing Guangdong province, officials estimate that about half a million of the city's 3m workforce are migrants - 'it is hard to get good statistics for illegal migrants into our city,' says Mr Fu Yin, division chief in the Guangzhou Planning Commission. 'But it is unavoidable, and the figure will increase.' He expects the number of migrants without work permits have risen to 900,000 by the end of the decade. Traditionally, the Chinese state has assigned jobs for life to its citizens, with housing, health and welfare benefits attached. Citizens received the benefit of this guaranteed living standard or 'iron rice bowl.' Meanwhile, the Communist Party was able to keep a close eye on the behaviour of its subjects. As economic development has accelerated, government officials have become aware that this highly immobile and inflexible labour system is hampering reforms. In 1986, a labour contract system was introduced for all newly recruited workers in the state sector, although by the end of last year only 16m (21 per cent) of total state enterprise employees had such contracts. The government is currently planning further labour market reforms, requiring all state employees to sign contracts. Unprofitable state enterprises were prevented over the summer from paying wage bonuses to their workers. Meanwhile, the state plans to remove from state enterprises the responsibility for provision of welfare, pensions and housing. Experiments are under way to allow housing agencies to buy housing stock from state enterprises, and then gradually to increase rents over time. The government has established an unemployment insurance system and is investigating a national retirement fund. 'Our ultimate objective is to create an active labour market so that enterprises can freely choose their workers, and in which labour is more mobile,' says Mr Zhu, vice labour minister. Yet the government remains cautious about the implications for 'social stability' of asking enterprises to shed surplus workers, let alone forcing unprofitable enterprises to go bankrupt. Official unemployment in urban areas is below 3 per cent, but government officials estimate that about 10 per cent of workers in state enterprises are under-employed, while a third of enterprises are unprofitable. 'We cannot allow many enterprises to go bankrupt because our society does not have the capacity to absorb these surplus workers,' says Mr Wei Liqun, Secretary General of the State Planning Commission. 'With unemployment at 2 per cent, our society is stable. But if unemployment rises above 5 per cent we will have social unrest.' As the importance of state enterprises has dwindled, so the grip of the state on the activities of its population has also been weakened. Less than half of China's non-agricultural workforce now works in state enterprises, with a growing number working in foreign-funded enterprises often at five times the wage of their state compatriots. Meanwhile, the proportion of workers employed in Township and Village Enterprises (TVEs) rose from 7 per cent in 1980 to 16 per cent in 1990. These workers account for 40 per cent of non-agricultural employment. One reason for the growth of this floating population is the accumulating surplus of farm labour owing to population growth and technological change. The labour ministry estimates that 130m of the total 333m agricultural labour force is now surplus to requirements, and estimates that this figure could reach 200m by the end of the decade. The World Bank estimates that, while urban employment should grow by 2.8 per cent a year, agricultural employment will stay constant. Another reason is the growing inequality of income between the richer coastal urban areas and poorer rural provinces. According to World Bank figures, the percentage of the population which now lives in poverty has fallen dramatically from 33 per cent in 1970 to 9 per cent in 1990. But poverty is highly concentrated in the countryside: 95 per cent of China's 100m poor live in rural areas. In many rural areas, the growth of rural industry has played an increasingly important role in alleviating poverty, a policy that the government now plans to encourage. But there is also substantial regional variation in poverty incidence, as the chart shows, while rural industry is much more prevalent in the richer regions. More than a quarter of the rural population in the southern provinces is employed in rural industry, compared to a mere 3.9 per cent in north-western Gansu province where a third of the rural population is poor. The government plans to encourage the growth of new urban areas in the poorer provinces by persuading enterprises and foreign investors to move to less developed areas. 'Our policy is that farmers can leave the land, but not the countryside,' says Mr Zhu of the labour ministry. But, as the floating population already shows, the development of China's labour market, like its economy, is not always under the government's control.</p>

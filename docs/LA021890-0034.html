He  coyly manipulated his case -- editorializing rather than documenting. It's  symbiotic; he's driven home not only these events of Flint, Mich., but his  subtext as well. If we are to be told a story with blinders on, then that story  should be called fiction.  </P> <P> RICHARD KILROY  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

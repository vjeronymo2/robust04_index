			<p><P> October 26, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: POP/ROCK  </P> <P> Plant Across America: Four months into his U.S. tour, former Led Zeppelin  singer Robert Plant is visiting a series of places not frequented by major rock  tours. In accordance with the change of venue, Plant has changed the name of  his tour from the "Manic Nirvana Tour" of North America to "The Tour That Time  Forgot." Plant, who has pledged to play "where no commercially aware musical  outfit dares to tread," will perform in November in such burgs as Laramie,  Wyo.; Sioux City, Iowa; Rapid City, S.D.; Joplin, Mo.; and Muskogee, Okla.

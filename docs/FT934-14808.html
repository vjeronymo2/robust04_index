			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Copper controversy is spectre at LME feast - Recriminations are continuing over the handling of this year's supply 'squeeze' LONDON'S annual 'metals week' is under way, bringing nearly everyone who is anyone in the metals business to the UK capital. And, not for the first time, the London Metal Exchange, the institution they have come to pay homage to, finds itself at the centre of controversy. Unusual activity has kept its 'flagship' copper contract in turmoil for much of this year. First prices slumped by one quarter in only five weeks, culminating in a 5 1/2 -year low in May. Several trading houses suffered huge losses - estimates range from Dollars 50m up to about USDollars 140m. There were no corporate casualties but a number of individual traders, including one reputed to have lost Dollars 14m in the copper price collapse, are now seeking employment. More recently there has been a severe supply 'squeeze'. Despite lacklustre world economic conditions and LME copper stocks reaching a 15-year peak, the copper price climbed steadily. There were accusations that the price was being manipulated upwards by a clever use of options. Fingers pointed at Sumitomo, the Japanese metals group, but Mr Yasuo Hamanaka, the senior manager responsible for copper trading and often described as the most powerful individual in the copper market, denied any manipulation was going on. He said the acute supply tightness was highly technical and could be traced back to the earlier sharp fall in prices. The LME board issued two public warnings about the squeeze and some arm-twisting went on behind the scenes, but all to no avail. So, at its meeting on September 8, the board decided to take emergency action 'in anticipated of the development of an undesirable situation in the copper market', and limited the daily backwardation (premium over the future price for metal for immediate delivery). Since then the squeeze has disappeared and the copper price has dropped sharply. It is far from clear what happened - and those who know are not telling. Some suggest that a big deal was done against the high copper price and so there was no longer any reason to continue the squeeze. Other rumours suggest that the banks financing those behind the squeeze became concerned after the LME board took action and refused to continue to provide the necessary credit. There are even suspicions that the squeezers and those being squeezed got together to work out a compromise arrangement after the board's action. Meanwhile, the LME board is in a classic 'no win' situation. It was widely condemned for allowing the copper price to be manipulated upwards. Now it is being criticised for interfering in the market and, in particular, for using a method that apparently favoured those who were short of copper (had sold metal they did not own in the expectation of being able to buy it later at a lower price). All this is of more than academic interest. Apart from being in London to pay homage to the LME, metals producers and consumers are starting their 'mating season', the endearing term used to describe the start of annual contract negotiations. At least half the contracts covering the six metals traded on the LME will be related directly to LME prices. There has been growing concern that in recent years the behaviour of the LME copper price has tended to become increasingly divorced from the perceived levels of physical supply and demand. Mr Martin Thompson, commercial adviser at RTZ, the world's biggest mining group, suggests the main cause is that the growth of the copper market, which is restricted to growth in copper consumption, 'has fallen far behind the growth in finance available to some market operators, whose capacity to influence the price has grown accordingly. 'Restriction on the supply of metal - attributed to a Japanese company  - did much to support copper's price in 1991,' he writes in Mining Journal's annual review. 'Heavy buying by Chinese companies, well beyond their physical purchases, performed the same service in 1992 and early this year. Operations by American commodity funds have also been influential from time to time. 'In addition, the volume of options now sold is such that covering by their sellers, by both buying and selling, has become a major 'rogue' element in the market.' Mr Raj Bagri, the LME's chairman suggested this week, in a spirited defence of his board's copper market intervention, that mobility in international money markets and a massive increase in options and other derivatives activity 'makes it comparatively easy or tempting for one or more participants, individually or acting in concert, to create in any free market like ours such dominant positions so as to result in potentially undesirable situations or practices'. 'We must be vigilant,' he said, 'and ready to deal with such situations as and when the need arises.' Speaking at the LME's annual dinner on Tuesday, Mr Bagri insisted that the board believed in free markets. 'But we also have a duty and obligation to run an orderly market and we are determined that the confidence reposed by the overwhelming majority of the metals trade and industry around the world in our reference prices continues to be justified and that these prices continue to be transparently and independently established without unwarranted distortions,' he declared. Mr David King, the LME's chief executive, points out that at least 80 per cent of the exchange's business is from metals processors and consumers. Less than 1 per cent of LME turnover is from commodity fund activity compared with 25 to 40 per cent on the New York Commodity Exchange. Admittedly banks are financing Dollars 4bn of LME stocks at present but 'this is mainly on behalf of producers and consumers.' Despite the criticisms, the LME is obviously doing something right. For the past four years business in tonnage terms has been increasing at an annual average rate of 30 per cent. Despite low metals prices, turnover this year will reach about USDollars 1,000bn, compared with Dollars 700bn in 1992. This still leaves the LME trailing well behind the big US commodity exchanges but it is different from them because 4 per cent of its contracts actually result in physical metal being delivered, much more than any other exchange. Mr King says the LME has three 'pillars': attractive hedging facilities; an extensive warehouse network, mainly in consuming areas, for physical delivery; and a reference price. 'All these must work well because that is what the customers want.' There is still some work to be done on the warehouse network even though there are now nearly 400 authorised to stock nearly 500 LME-approved brands sourced from about 60 countries. At present only aluminium is delivered to those in Japan while copper is excluded from those in the US. 'Eventually copper and other metals will go into Japanese warehouses and copper will go into US ones - but only when the time is right,' says Mr King. 'At the moment the industries in those countries are not supportive.' The LME is also looking at the potential for warehouses in the 'tiger' states of the Far East, an area of fast economic growth. Thailand, South Korea and Taiwan are all possible locations. Mr King says the LME is also keeping a wary eye on the potential merger between the New York Mercantile Exchange and the New York Commodity Exchange, which also has a copper contract. 'Nymex has big resources and trades precious metals, so a merger represents additional competition. And any Comex merger would force us to step up LME marketing in the US - that market has so much growth potential,' he says. While the threat of a competitive metals exchange being set up in Japan has subsided, Mr King suggests the LME must be wary about Germany. 'Germany wants to be more involved in financial activities of all types and it might be on the agenda there,' he says. 'It is the main European consumer of metals and it has the resources.' Many other exchanges have 'gone electronic' but the LME will retain its present system where ring-dealing members shout themselves hoarse at 'open outcry' sessions several times a day. Mr King says the LME's way of trading cannot be put on screen without too many sacrifices - there are too many 'prompt' dates. In any case: 'Without the open outcry system you miss the body language, the expressions on faces, the way dealers say things. Screens can't provide this information'.</p>

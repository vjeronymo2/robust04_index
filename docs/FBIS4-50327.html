According to an official with the project, the industrial  zone covers an area of 337,000 sq m, of which 120,000 sq m are  for industrial development, 110,000 sq m for construction of  roads, some 8,000 sq m for grassland, 30,000 sq m for public  facilities and the rest for commercial and residential use.    Costing an estimated 100 million Macao patacas (13 million  U.S. dollars), the infrastructural construction mainly covers  water routes, roads, afforestation, running water facilities,  power and telecommunications network.    The official said, at present, enterprises from the  Zhongshan  harbor high-tech development zone, Guangdong Province, have  handed over six project letters to Macao government for  approval.

Macao government stipulated that construction terms for all  projects in the industrial zone would end before 1999, the  official said.    Approved by Macao government in 1975, the industrial zone is  expected to boost the multi-facet and high-tech industrial  development in Macao.</p>

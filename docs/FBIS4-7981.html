			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ladislav Orosz: "Referendum Controversy"] </F>   [Text] In connection with the drive to collect signatures  for a petition calling for a referendum, the greatest  controversy is engendered by the second question, which concerns  the fate of the electoral mandate of those deputies who left the  ranks of the political parties on whose ticket they ran in the  elections. Views have been expressed that this question is  unconstitutional and cannot be the subject of the referendum.  Many are asking what the position of the president of the Slovak  Republic [SR] is in this respect: Can he refuse to hold a  referendum on this issue?    In searching for an answer to this question, we come up  against the fact that the pertinent provisions of the SR  Constitution are ambiguous and even contradictory. According to  Article 93, Paragraph 3 of the Constitution, "basic rights and  freedoms, taxes, levies, and the state budget cannot be the  subject of a referendum." It would follow from the quoted phrase  that a referendum cannot be held on these questions. On the  other hand, the text of Article 95 of the Constitution is  formulated in such a way that it makes it incumbent on the SR  president to call a referendum if a petition containing the  signatures of at least 350,000 citizens requests it. Therefore,  if the SR president were not to call a referendum, he could be  accused of violating the Constitution, specifically its Article  95.    What remains unanswered is who will judge whether the  question proposed for the referendum cannot be the subject of  the referendum according to Article 93, Paragraph 3 of the  Constitution. The conception of the Constitution implies that  the instrument should be the SR Constitutional Court as the  independent judicial institution for the protection of  constitutionality. The problem lies in the fact that the  Constitution does not specifically entrust the determination of  these questions to the jurisdiction of the SR Constitutional  Court. The authority of the SR Constitutional Court to give an  opinion on the problem under discussion can be indirectly  implied from Article 128, Paragraph 1 of the Constitution: "The  Constitutional Court interprets constitutional laws when there  is a controversy. The conditions will be determined by law."    The conditions referred to in the quoted provision of the  Constitution are set down in Law No. 38/1993 of the SR National  Council on the organization of the SR Constitutional Court,  proceedings before it, and the standing of its judges in  Sections 45 to 47. Accordingly, the Constitutional Court  interprets the constitutional laws only when a controversy  arises about their interpretation between the proposer (it could  even be the president) and some state agency. From what is  mentioned above, it appears that, under the existing laws, the  president cannot, in the case of the planned referendum, turn to  the Constitutional Court for an interpretation before the  referendum is announced because there is no controversy with a  state agency. The possibility of using such an approach could be  provided to him only by an amendment of the mentioned law.    The president could have some possibility of turning to the  Constitutional Court under the existing law only after the  referendum has taken place. If the Constitutional Court arrives  at the opinion that one of the questions asked in the referendum  could not have been the subject of the referendum as determined  in Article 93, Paragraph 3 of the Constitution, it could, in my  opinion, declare such a referendum invalid. But the  Constitutional Court would obviously make such a ruling in an  extremely tense political situation and in a state of  constitutional turmoil, which the results of the referendum  could create in view of the conflicting nature of the several  provisions of the Constitution in respect to the question  concerning the fate of the deputies' electoral mandates.    Under such circumstances, before announcing the referendum,  it would be more appropriate to create a way, through  legislative means, for the Constitutional Court to determine the  constitutionality of the planned referendum, an additional  reason being the initial very negative responses from abroad.</p>

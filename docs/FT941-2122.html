			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Hang Seng and KLSE lead decline in the region In spite of Japan's absence, closed for the spring equinox holiday, the region's markets were very active. Hong Kong continued to fall, and most analysts expect it to fall further before finding a new support level. HONG KONG succumbed to heavy institutional selling triggered a wave of sell orders by local investors. The Hang Seng index tumbled 5.1 per cent, or 465.28 to 8,667.03, having hit a low of 8,658. Turnover was HKDollars 6.2bn. Brokers commented that most of the sell orders initially came from Europe, before accelerating as local investors added their orders. Blue chips lost across the board: HSBC Holdings fell HKDollars 5 to HKDollars 87.50, and Sun Hung Kai Properties HKDollars 3 to HKDollars 50. KUALA LUMPUR took a 5 per cent tumble as US funds withdrew, writes Kieran Cooke. The composite index lost 52.88 to 954.18. The market dropped below the 1,000 level for the first time since early December. Brokers said that there was heavy selling of blue chip stocks with foreign fund managers poised to move funds either back to the US or into Japan. 'At the moment it's more a retreat than a stampede,' said one broker. Individual buyers have been driving the market up in recent months but retail buyers have been concentrating on highly speculative second board stocks. Some local economic indicators are also thought to have contributed to market nervousness: while Malaysia's gross domestic product seems likely to grow by more than 8 per cent this year, there is concern that moves by Bank Negara, the central bank, to control inflation are not working. SINGAPORE, struck by redemption selling, suffered one of its biggest one-day falls this year. At its lowest point on Monday, the 30-share index was down nearly 3.5 percent, or 72.83 points. The Straits Times Industrial index gathered some ground on late bargain hunting to end off 67.72 or 3.2 per cent at 2,306.30. SEOUL had worries of its own as tensions continued to increase with North Korea. The composite index shed 8.34 to 885.65. Investors shrugged off the news that South Korea will allow foreign investors to buy some convertible bonds from June. Turnover was Won620bn. TAIWAN alone among the south-east Asian markets showed a rise on the day, helped by news that the SEC had approved the stock dividends by the Big Three banks. But sentiment remained nervous and China Steel closed below its public offer price for the first time. The weighted index rose 26.10 at 5,220.73, off an intra-day high of 5,243. Turnover was TDollars 30.4bn. China Steel lost 20 cents at TDollars 21.60, below the TDollars 21.71 price for its current public offer of 288m shares, which closes on Tuesday. MANILA was upset by the fall in Philippine Long Distance Telephone in New York on Friday. The composite index lost 59.41 to 2,598.57, with turnover down to 346.8m pesos. PLDT fell 55 pesos or nearly 3 per cent to 1,820 pesos while Philippine National Bank was down 30 pesos at 515 pesos. The Philippines' two stock markets will be merged tomorrow with a single price and quote for all 200 issues. AUSTRALIA tumbled sharply at the close with many investors absent. The All Ordinaries index lost 23.0 to 2,140.5, but off its day's low of 2,136.6. Turnover was ADollars 415.9m. BHP was down 16 cents to ADollars 17.14 in turnover of 3.9m shares ahead of its quarterly results. News Corp fell 17 cents to ADollars 9.38 while Fosters Brewing, which saw 6.87m shares traded, lost 4 cents to ADollars 1.21. NEW ZEALAND shed 1.65 per cent in line with the trend set elsewhere in the region. The NZSE-40 capital index fell 37.83 to 2,255.34 at the close. Brierley Investments, which last week said it would make a NZDollars 175m profit from the sale of part of its Carter Holt stake, slipped 1 cent to NZDollars 1.37. BANGKOK ended 3.4 per cent lower, but managed to retain the 1,200 level. The SET index lost 42.72 to 1,204.12 in turnover of Bt5.3bn. Issues fell across the board although banks found some support. KARACHI finished at a record high with the KSE 100 share index rising 7.76 to 2,653.64, helped by a rush of late buying. BOMBAY was little changed on the day as investors continued to await developments regarding a ban on carry forward trade. The BSE 30-share index closed up 4.41 at 3,806.27.</p>

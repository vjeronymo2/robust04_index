			<p>940530 FT  30 MAY 94 / Working Life: Where to find the best Chinese meals in London  -Eating out London's Chinese restaurants originated to feed sailors who manned ships from the Far East. Hence, the first eating houses of this type were along the Thames. Today only Chinatown (987 2330), Tai Pan (791 0118), Old Friends (790 5027) and Young Friends (987 4276) remain in the Limehouse area of London's East End. In the interim, Chinese restaurants have spread throughout London. Among the more expensive are the Oriental in the Dorchester Hotel, W1 (629 8888), which has a Michelin star, Imperial City in the Royal Exchange, EC3 (626 3437), where Ken Hom the well known American/Chinese chef is consultant, Poons in the City, EC3 (626 0126) and the Inn of Happiness, St. James's Court Hotel, SW1 (821 1931). These are Chinese restaurants at which you can certainly impress business guests. The service has none of the abruptness that can characterise cheaper Chinese restaurants but the bill can be the equivalent of that in a top French or Italian restaurant - Pounds 30 to Pounds 50 per head - particularly if you are lured into ordering one or more of their specialities - abalone, shark's fin or a whole Peking duck - or leave the choice of the menu to the manager. (If you do this, always specify a maximum price per head.) The highest concentration of Chinese restaurants is now in London's Chinatown, an area of the West End delineated by Shaftesbury Avenue to the north, and Lisle Street to the south, with its borders along Wardour Street and Charing Cross Road. The main thoroughfare is the pedestrianised Gerrard Street which boasts a host of Chinese food shops (including Chinese sweet shops), as well as several good restaurants, particularly Harbour City (439 7120), London Chinatown (437 3186) and Lee Ho Fook (439 1829). The many Chinese restaurants in the area fall into three loose categories. First, those which offer an extensive lunch and dinner menu. The most interesting of these are: Fung Shing (437 1539), Mr Kong (437 7341) and Poons (437 4549) of Lisle Street; Ming in Greek Street (734 2721) and the Mayflower on Shaftesbury Avenue (734 9207). Then there are those cavernous restaurants which at lunchtime serve Chinese dim sum. These tend to be noisy but good value, particularly for entertaining large groups, as the average price of each dish is low. The New World in Gerrard Place (734 0396), Cheun Cheng Ku in Wardour Street (437 1398), China Court in the Swiss Centre (424 0108) and Tai Wing Wah in Newport Place (287 2702) are among the most popular. Finally, almost all these restaurants offer a 'one dish' meal for the adventurous but single diner. Try the tiny branch of Lee Ho Fook, in Macclesfield Street, for a large bowl of duck and noodles or pork and rice that, with a pot of Chinese tea, will leave change from Pounds 5. Or pay Pounds 6 at Poons, in Leicester Street (437 1528), for a large earthenware bowl of steamed rice cooked with eel steaks and black bean sauce. This was so warm and filling it seemed to dry my very wet feet.</p>

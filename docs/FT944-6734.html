			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / Survey of Pakistan (8): Hopes pinned on new rules - Banking and bad loans Mr Badruddin Khan, president of Schon Bank, in Karachi - Pakistan's newest private bank - laments from his office in the heart of the business district at Chundrigar Road, that very few poor people come to his bank to do business. He wants to open two branches in the city for small merchants, fruit vendors, grocery sellers and traders in cheap consumer items, in order to find clients who would otherwise stay away from the fast-moving business quarters. Mr Khan has joined the ranks of bankers who are becoming cautious over a history of bad bank debts, and who feel that small borrowers may be more reliable than large and influential ones. In a country where public sector banks are reeling under the pressure of almost Rs76bn (Dollars 2.4bn) in bad loans, almost no one is convinced that all the money can ever be recovered. Many of these loans were given out under political pressures during the past two decades, following nationalisation of the banks in the early 1970s. That legacy has cast a shadow over the future of the country's two largest public-sector banks - Habib Bank and United Bank - which successive Pakistani governments have planned to privatise for more than four years. The two banks are together faced with a 'classified debt', or loans which are difficult to recover, worth almost Rs34bn. That is almost one quarter of their combined portfolios at Rs140bn. The government claims that stronger regulatory powers, given to the central bank last year to monitor new loans from banks, will at least help to ensure that the extent of bad loans does not increase. If that policy works, it may in time reduce the portion of such loans in overall lendings and help give stability to the financial system. 'The bad debts may not come down sharply but, with growth in lending, they will decline in their overall proportion,' says Mr VA Jafarey, the prime minister's adviser on finance. Whatever the future trend, Mr Khan is encouraged that the past legacy of the bad loans comes with a silver lining. He hopes that private banks will eventually attract more clients, especially those looking for efficient services and better profits. Drawing a lesson from that bitter past, Mr Khan wants his bank to diversify beyond traditional commercial banking, to become involved in a wide variety of activities which would also minimise the risks attached to lendings - 'in a couple of years, new demands for merchant banking, financial and brokerage houses will be made on the market,' he says, forecasting his bank's future in a changing corporate environment. A few kilometres up the road, at the offices of Muslim Commercial Bank - Pakistan's first public sector bank to be privatised, three years ago  - Mr Hussain Lawai, the president, is convinced that private banking is the way of the future. 'The performance of public sector banks could improve if the management is handed over to the private sector,' he says. The MCB's record supports his claim. Profits have doubled, and deposits have trebled in the three years since privatisation. In addition to the nine new local commercial banks which have begun business since licences for private banks were issued in 1991, Mr Lawai sees a bright future for foreign banks. Deregulation on foreign exchange has encouraged many Pakistanis to deposit their savings in foreign currency, to seek added protection against devaluation of the rupee and possibly as a way to facilitate foreign travel. Some bankers are convinced that new contracts signed this year in the energy sector, worth up to Dollars 12bn, have created opportunities for foreign banks to further improve their impressive performance of recent years. According to estimates by Pakistan's central bank, all the local commercial banks (public and private) had total deposits worth Rs436bn by the end of this summer at their 7,738 branches across the country. However, the foreign banks, with a total of 74 branches, had deposits of approximately Rs120bn, or more than a quarter of those of Pakistani banks. 'The nationalised banking sector has become so inefficient that new commercial and investment banks have an opportunity to eat into their market share,' says Mr Nessar Ahmed, president of Cresbank, one of the 11 investment banks. However, such optimism does not hide the memory of this year's large banking scandal involving the Mehran Bank - a private bank. The bank's chief operating officer was arrested on charges of fraud, after allegations that he had given large loans to influential clients in return for personal favours which eventually led him to amass a fortune running into several hundred million rupees. The government claims credit for moving fast to protect depositors' interests in that bank, despite concerns over inadequate laws. Even if Pakistan is able to live up to the challenge of regulating private banks to protect consumer interests, the sector would still be left to deal with the public sector banks. Some bankers say that, before putting up the two banks for privatisation, the government will have to reveal their exact financial picture, and give the new management full power to hire and fire in order to trim over-staffed operations. 'When we bring these issues (banks) to the market, we would have to make a full disclosure, and that is the only way to get a genuine investor,' concedes Mr Naveed Qamar, chairman of the privatisation commission, responding to those concerns. Despite that commitment, no one knows what the response would be to such an offer.</p>

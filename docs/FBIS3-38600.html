"We note that there has been no progress in discussions  between the United States and North Korea concerning a  resumption of inspections by the International Atomic Energy  Agency (IAEA) and we think the issue of sanctions should be  taken up before the Security Council," Foreign Ministry  spokeswoman Catherine Colonna said.    Pyongyang, which is suspected of developing nuclear weapons,  has been refusing to allow IAEA inspections of two key nuclear  sites since last February, despite repeated international  pressure. [passage omitted]    Although North Korean negotiators agreed last month in  principle to allow the inspections, no accord has been reached  on the terms of how the inspections will be carried out.

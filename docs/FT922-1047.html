			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / International Company News: Argus increases annual earnings 20% BUOYANT advertising revenues in the second half helped Argus Holdings, South Africa's largest media and publishing group, to record a 20 per cent increase in earnings in the year to March. Depressed economic conditions and continuing political uncertainty were reflected in the modest turnover increase to R2.01bn from R1.81bn. A strong emphasis on cost containment and maintaining margins, however, helped boost trading income by 16.3 per cent to R194.5m. Net income after tax was 18.5 per cent higher at R102m (Dollars 36m), while equity accounted earnings were 18 per cent higher at R143.6m. Attributable income rose by 23 per cent to R89.7m. Earnings per share were 20.3 per cent higher at 213 cents. CNA Gallo was hard hit by the increased pressure on consumer spending. Earnings dropped by 4 per cent. Times Media did well to lift earnings by 32 per cent, while M-Net's earnings fell by 14 per cent. The dividend was only 10 per cent higher at 55 cents per share.</p>

Daniels Recital  Hall remained closed as well as the 8-year-old hall, which has been fenced off  and is being patrolled around-the-clock by campus security guards.  </P> <P> Structural inspections showed that five brick buildings containing classrooms,  practice rooms and faculty offices were safe, said university spokeswoman Toni  Beron. She added that two larger buildings next to the hall probably will be  reopened next week.  </P></p>

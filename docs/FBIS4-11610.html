			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] RUSSIAN ENVOY ON TRADE OBSTACLES, SPACE  PROJECTS -- Russian Ambassador to Brazil Iosif N. Podrazhanets,  who recently assumed the post, believes that it will be very  difficult to raise the level of commercial trade between the two  countries, currently ranging between $300 million and $400  million, the Sao Paulo daily GAZETA MERCANTIL reported in its 31  March-4 April issue. The reasons were cited as threefold:  political instability in Russia, which keeps Brazilian investors  away; shipping costs, which are higher than in the trade between  Brazil and the United States; and a deficiency in providing  sufficient stimulus to the space sector. Russia, GAZETA  continued, is determined to cooperate with Brazil in creating an  infrastructure by supplying technology and equipment for the  satellite launch vehicle project. Russia also wants to  participate in the Amazon protection and surveillance project,  but it lacks the resources to finance equipment sales.    The protocol of intent, signed between Brazil and Russia in  December 1993 and intended to increase bilateral trade to $2  billion annually, has not yet "gotten off the ground," according  to Ambassador Podrazhanets, due to difficulties in finding the  mechanisms necessary to implement the project, particularly  resources. "It's difficult to find the right products for that  type of trade," he said.    In May or June, Podrazhanets continued, the Russian minister  of atomic energy will visit Brazil, and in the ensuing months, a  joint economic and commercial commission meeting will be held,  during which Russia will discuss its interest in increasing  cooperation in the areas of space, energy, and mining.    CUBA SIGNS S&amp;T ACCORDS WITH STATE GOVERNMENTS -- An  article  in the Sao Paulo daily O ESTADO DE SAO PAULO of 22 March  announced that the Cuban and Sao Paulo State Governments will  begin an S&amp;T exchange program in April that will bring a  number  of Cuban specialists to Sao Paulo state universities. In the  article, Secretary Roberto Muller of the Secretariat of Science,  Technology, and Economic Development remarked: "We are  particularly interested in the transfer of Cuban technology for  the development of research in DNA and genetic engineering for  plants." The exchange program is a result of discussions held on  18 March between visiting Cuban Minister of Higher Education  Fernando Vecino Alegret and Secretary Muller, University of  Campinas (Unicamp) Rector Carlos Vogt, and Sao Paulo State  University (Unesp) Rector Arthur Roquete de Macedo. Secretary  Muller further commented that the Sao Paulo state government is  also interested in the use of sugarcane waste to generate  thermal energy, as well as the mastery of techniques to increase  the shelf life of cement. The agreement signed with Cuba was  modeled along the lines of the accord signed with the Russian  Government, O ESTADO continued. According to Muller, the  secretariat is already studying the possibility of bringing in  additional researchers, and will shortly be meeting with  university rectors to review the situation.    CONSORTIUMS PLAN TELECOMMUNICATIONS SATELLITES LAUNCH -- Sao  Paulo daily FOLHA DE SAO PAULO reported on 25 March that  Brazilian Discount Bank (Bradesco), Odebrecht construction firm,  Monteiro Aranha, Victori Internacional, and Globopar, owned by  businessman Roberto Marinho, formed an association with the  French Matra Marconi Space firm, and established an enterprise  called Latin American Satellite Systems Communications (CLASS)  for the purpose of launching three privately owned satellites to  serve Brazil and neighboring Southern Cone countries. A second  consortium, formed by the Itamaraty Group owned by businessman  Olacyr de Morais, Splice do Brasil, and the German firm Deutsche  Aerospace will compete for the same market acting as an  associate and commercial representative of the Argentine Nahuel  satellite.    The two consortiums, according to FOLHA, want to compete  with  the Brazilian Telecommunications Company (Embratel) in data  transmission and offer options for new services, particularly in  the area of cable television. Both the Nahuel satellite and the  three satellites of the CLASS project will operate on the KU  band, which is higher than the frequencies of Brasilsat's C  band, and will allow TV signals to be picked up by 6O-cm  parabolic antennas that can even be installed on apartment  verandas.    The CLASS project, which will involve investments of $300  million, was announced on 24 March during the Fourth  International Telecommunications and Teleinformatics Congress  (Telexpo) in Sao Paulo. Victori International Vice President  Joao Santelli Junior told FOLHA that the project is only now  being made public but has been in planning since 1992. In  November 1993, the consortium asked the Ministry of  Communications for three orbital positions. On 22 December,  former Telecommunications Minister Hugo Napoleao petitioned the  UN International Telecommunications Union (UIT) to authorize the  orbital space positions, but the UIT has not yet published its  decision. If the request is granted, the CLASS project and the  Nahuel consortium will still need authorization from the  Ministry of Communications.    According to Olacyr de Morais of the Itamaraty Group, the  telecommunications market has great potential and several  competitors are vying for it. FOLHA reported that that  consortium has more ambitious plans than simply shareholder  participation in the Argentine Nahuel satellite and intends to  launch its own satellite.    Brazilian Communications Minister Djalma Morais remarked  that  Embratel and the state telephone companies are interested in  participating as shareholders in the CLASS project; there may be  criticisms from within Embratel ranks, however, of any attempt  to launch private satellites. Some Embratel representatives  believe that the operation of satellites is part of the state  telecommunications monopoly. Communications Minister Morais,  however, is of the opinion that the satellites will only provide  limited services and therefore will not effect the state's  monopoly.    Victori International Vice President Joao Santelli Junior  also told FOLHA that the CLASS project intends to launch the  first satellite in 1996 and the second in 1997. He said that the  KU band satellites will also make it possible to install  telephone terminals at an average cost of $3,000 each in remote  areas. The current installation cost in remote areas of Brazil  is as much as $100,000 per terminal.    CNEN, SCIENTISTS FAVOR QUADRIPARTITE SAFEGUARDS ACCORD --  Prior to the 9 February Brazilian Senate's approval of the  quadripartite nuclear safeguards agreement (QSA) between Brazil,  Argentina, the Brazilian-Argentine Agency for Accounting and  Control of Nuclear Materials (ABACC), and the International  Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), National Nuclear Energy Commission  (CNEN), President Marcio Costa and various scientists commented  favorably on the agreement's impending Senate ratification in  Sao Paulo O ESTADO DE SAO PAULO of 8 February. O ESTADO began by  quoting a press statement made in Rio on 7 February by CNEN  President Marcio Costa supporting the Senate's ratification of  the QSA which will authorize international inspections of  Brazilian nuclear installations. Although he opined that Brazil  will lose sovereignty in the nuclear area, the CNEN head said  that he was in favor of its ratification in order to avoid  retaliations by First World countries. Costa criticized Germany,  which had earlier threatened to break the 1975 Brazil-FRG  nuclear accord, suspend the transfer of technology, and withdraw  support for Brazil obtaining a permanent seat in the UN Security  Council. "They pulled off the worst swindle in the country with  that technology transfer story."    O ESTADO then went on to quote Ennio Candotti, former  president and member of the council of the Brazilian Society for  the Progress of Science (SBPC), as saying that Brazil should  ratify the quadripartite accord and the Treaty of Tlatelolco.  "But it is important," he added, "to extend those agreements to  the countries that today hold arsenals of nuclear arms such as  the United States, France, Britain, and Germany itself."  Candotti then commented on Germany's threats: "I didn't even  know that a nuclear accord with Germany was still in effect, so  numerous have been the mistakes earmarking the 1975 treaty that  provided for the construction of eight power plants."  Furthermore, he added, "a seat on the UN Security Council is  not acquired through bartering agreements and disagreements."    Professor Giorgio Moscati, head of the Physics Institute's  Experimental Physics Department of the University of Sao Paulo  (USP), believes that Brazil should ratify the accords, O ESTADO  continued. "There is no reason for the country not to open up  for a peaceful program and open itself up to international  inspections," he remarked. Then Brazil will, in return, be able  to demand that it cease being discriminated against in imports  of products that may have a military application, he added. O  ESTADO then noted that Professor Ivan Cunha Nascimento, head of  the USP Applied Physics Department, is of the same opinion. "The  accord should be ratified, simply because Brazil is  discriminated against internationally and consequently does not  have access to state of the art technology that may have a  military application." He further explained that "Brazil is  considered a `sensitive' country abroad for having a nuclear  program that is neither known nor inspected."</p>

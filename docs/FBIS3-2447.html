			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Chris Yeung in Beijing] </F>   [Text] Patriarch Deng Xiaoping and leaders Jiang Zemin and  Li Peng might have to make a declaration of assets including the  investments of their children if the politically-sensitive  policy is adopted by the Communist Party, it was suggested  yesterday. According to a key adviser to China, Xu Simin, the  present leadership is inclined to introduce the practice of  declaration of economic interests, adding that he hoped it would  be implemented in six months.    Mr Xu, a Standing Committee member of the CPPCC, said senior  party leader Li Ruihuan, also chairman of the conference, had  agreed to make a declaration. Mr Xu, publisher of the Hong  Kong-based monthly THE MIRROR, said he had further suggested  that details of the education and work of the children of cadres  should be reported.    Meanwhile, Cheng Yiu-tong, a Hong Kong delegate to the NPC  said yesterday that he would suggest in the congress that the  Chinese Government set up an anti-corruption body independent of  the government. It was understood that the antigraft body would  be similar to the Independent Commission Against Corruption  (ICAC) in Hong Kong. A few provincial and municipal  legislatures have already taken steps to enact local-level codes  on the formation of ICAC-like bodies.    Talking to Hong Kong reporters yesterday, Mr Xu said a  declaration of assets by leaders would help eliminate graft  activities. "It might be likely that some cadres will transfer  their money to accounts under the name of their children," he  said. It is widely known that children of some senior leaders  have been deeply involved with business activities overseas,  particularly through Hong Kong.    They included the children of Mr Deng, the late Wang Zhen,  and the Rong Yiren families. A number of children of current  leaders such as Mr Jiang, Mr Li Peng, Mr Qiao Shi are also known  to have studied and settled abroad.    Mr Xu said: "I'm not fingering any individuals but I just  want to propose a way to solve the problem. "Yes. It's  possible that there will be a lot of misreporting or  underreporting of property. But at least we can have some  information to pursue the matter. If people like Deng Xiaoping  and Li Peng have made the declaration, others are not to evade  the reporting," he said.    Mr Xu asserted that the crux of the battle against  corruption  was to launch the fight at the leading echelon of the party and  the government. "If the leaders do not behave themselves you  cannot expect the people further down to give a damn to the  [anticorruption] campaign," he said.    The CPPCC Standing Committee said it reacted strongly at  internal meetings on corruption and was critical over the  achievements of the campaign since it was launched in August.    In an apparent move to quieten discontent, Mr Xu said the  central government would hold a nationwide anti-corruption work  conference in the next few days. The convening of the work  conference coincides with the meetings of the CPPCC plenum which  opened yesterday and the plenary session of the NPC scheduled  for opening tomorrow.    Early this week, premier Li said in a meeting that unless  the  leadership was serious in the crackdown on corruption, the  ruling party might lose its grip on power.    During the peak of the pro-democracy movement in 1989,  former  Communist Party boss Zhao Ziyang suggested that senior officials  should make public their wealth and face public scrutiny. His  suggestion was rejected by the senior echelon who accused him of  using the issue to divide the party.</p>

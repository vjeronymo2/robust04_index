			<p>930607 FT  07 JUN 93 / European debut for Clarke: New UK chancellor arouses curiosity in Brussels MR KENNETH CLARKE makes his European debut as UK chancellor of the exchequer at a meeting of EC finance ministers in Luxembourg today. The meeting is expected to focus on rising unemployment and the bleak outlook for Europe's economic growth. Latest Commission forecasts indicate the EC's gross national product will shrink slightly in 1993, with only a moderate rebound next year. This is not enough to stop unemployment in the EC rising to more than 17.5m this year and has reinforced UK scepticism about another item on today's agenda: an EC-wide energy tax. Britain, however, remains virtually isolated in its opposition. Mr Clarke's appointment has aroused interest in Brussels, where diplomats and officials are curious about his pro-European credentials and his reported ambition to become UK prime minister. The Danish presidency of the EC has promised to make growth and employment a priority at the Copenhagen summit on June 21-22, but today's meeting is likely to show that most member states have little budgetary room for new stimulus packages. Mr Henning Christophersen, EC economics commissioner, will urge ministers to build on the Community's 'growth package' agreed at last December's summit in Edinburgh. He is due to release official EC growth forecasts on June 16. The latest internal estimates suggest that the EC economy may contract by about 0.3 per cent, compared with an original forecast earlier this year of 0.8 per cent growth. Recognising the tightness in member states' budgets, the Commission is looking at ways to inject new life into the Community's labour market. Among the main ideas are increasing flexibility, creating more part-time jobs and changing tax regimes. Today's meeting will study other tax issues, including the harmonisation of VAT rates on works of art. Germany and Spain appear to have eased their opposition to Commission proposals, 'but the real question is whether the British are prepared to play ball', said an EC official. Finance ministers were originally due to discuss the UK's 'convergence programme' - the plan for each member state to meet targets for budgetary discipline and non-inflationary growth in preparation for monetary union. The UK submits these plans even though it is not in the European exchange rate mechanism. Mr Clarke has successfully requested that the UK plan is withdrawn so he can study the document. EC officials said last week that this would allow him, technically, to make amendments before re-submitting the proposal at the next meeting of economic and finance ministers.</p>

			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / International Company News: MAS embarks on extensive expansion - Prospects of the airline launching Malaysia's biggest rights issue A FIRE last month which destroyed the control tower at Kuala Lumpur airport, severely disrupting international and domestic flights for more than two weeks, could not have come at a worse time for Malaysia Airlines (MAS), the country's national carrier. For today, MAS launches Malaysia's biggest rights issue, raising MDollars 1.75bn (USDollars 700m) in a one-for-one share offering. Since the Malaysian government still controls more than 50 per cent of MAS, it is unlikely to let the issue fail, though many analysts see turbulent times ahead. The cash to be raised will be used partly to fund one of the world airline industry's most ambitious expansion programmes. In the course of its present five-year plan - 1991-92 to 1996-97 - MAS has orders for 72 aircraft costing a total MDollars 10.6bn. The aircraft are needed to meet what MAS foresees as a substantial increase in domestic and international travel in the coming years. Old aircraft have to be replaced, while expensive leased aircraft, which now make up more than half the total fleet, will be phased out. Overall, MAS plans to increase its fleet from 74 aircraft to about 100 over the next five years. MAS started life as Malayan Airlines in the years before the Second World War. In the 1960s, it was known as Malaysia-Singapore Airlines. In the early 1970s, a split occurred, giving birth to MAS and Singapore Airlines. Over the years, MAS has tended to be overshadowed by the success of SIA, even though in terms of passengers carried it is substantially bigger than its southern neighbour and competitor. MAS is now determined to establish itself as a leading international and regional carrier. 'We want to turn Malaysia Airlines into one of the super excellent airlines in the world in terms of schedules and services,' says Mr Kamaruddin Ahmad, managing director. The airline is encouraged by continued strong economic growth at home and forecasts of rapidly increasing regional passenger traffic, particularly in south-east Asia. MAS plans to increase overall capacity by between 10 and 15 per cent in each of the next five years. New routes are being opened, most recently to Johannesburg and Mexico City. Infrastructural investments of nearly MDollars 1.5bn are also planned. These include MDollars 700m towards the cost of a new international airport outside Kuala Lumpur, scheduled to be completed before the Commonwealth Games in the city in 1998, and nearly MDollars 200m for a local maintenance centre. MAS, partially privatised in 1985, is 42 per cent owned by Bank Negara, the Malaysian central bank, and 5 per cent each by the state governments in the east Malaysian states of Sabah and Sarawak. The Brunei government holds another 10 per cent. Mr S. Suppiah, director of finance at MAS, has no doubts about the rights issue but admits funding the airline's expansion programme is not an easy task. 'There will be an inevitable pressure on our cash-flow,' says Mr Suppiah. 'We've had to go in for some short to medium-term loans. So far we have been able to raise financing at good rates. But things will be tough in the years ahead.' One problem is that Japanese banks and investment houses, the main source of aerospace funds in the Asia region, are becoming more cautious about lending. While the Malaysian banks are sitting on substantial funds, interest rates are high. The MAS balance sheet is another problem. MAS registered pre-tax profits MDollars 120m in 1991-92 and MDollars 206m in 1990-91. But these figures included funds raised from aircraft sales. Take these out and there was an operating loss of MDollars 169m in 1991 and only a small operating profit of MDollars 38m in 1992. What concerned analysts most about the 1991-92 figures was a 3 per cent drop in the airline's overall load factor - representing the utilisation of aircraft - to 65.9 per cent, the lowest level since the early 1980s. Another area of concern was a rise of more than 19 per cent in staff costs. 'They seem to have exaggerated aircraft demand and they have not been careful enough about controlling labour costs,' said one aviation analyst. 'MAS is still seen as overly bureaucratic and government, rather than market, orientated.' MAS has forecast a substantial increase in pre-tax profits for 1992-93 to MDollars 372m. The estimated value of aircraft sales within that figure has not been made clear. On the plus side, the government earlier this year approved a 20 per cent increase in domestic air fares - the first such increase for a decade. However, domestic routes are unlikely to break even for some years. It is believed passenger traffic on both domestic and international routes grew substantially in the first half of the year. But nearly 80 per cent of total revenues come from international routes and the recent appreciation of the Malaysian dollar against most currencies is likely to have eaten into profits. 'The basic problem is planning,' says a regional aviation analyst. 'MAS should really have started its aircraft renewal and expansion programme much earlier and phased it over a longer period. It should be teaming up with other airlines and not trying to go it alone. 'In the long term, with the potential for substantial tourism growth in Malaysia and the growth in regional passenger traffic, prospects are good. But in the short term MAS is in for a rough ride.'</p>

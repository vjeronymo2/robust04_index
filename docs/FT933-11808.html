			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / Castro to open up Cuba's ailing economy PRESIDENT Fidel Castro has indicated that he will pursue further economic reforms to prop up Cuba's battered economy, including a greater opening to foreign investment and permitting Cubans to hold foreign currency. Such proposals did not constitute 'magic formulas', he said, and not all Cubans would benefit. But 'we are ready to do everything that is necessary to save the fatherland, the revolution and the triumphs of socialism; that is to say we will not be dogmatic nor mad'. Mr Castro, speaking on Monday, the 40th anniversary of a guerrilla attack that officially marks the beginning of the Cuban revolution, painted a stark picture of the country's economic plight. He said imports this year would be just Dollars 1.7bn, against Dollars 2.2bn last year and Dollars 8.1bn in 1991, as a result of Cuba's collapsing hard currency receipts. Bad weather and fuel shortages caused the sugar crop to fall to 4.2m tonnes this year, leading to a reduction of about Dollars 450m in sugar earnings. While the regulation of ownership of hard currency was still under study, all Cubans would be able to use their foreign currency in specially designated dollar shops. When the new laws were passed, Cuba would introduce a national convertible currency, Mr Castro indicated. Apparently, this will not replace the Cuban peso as the currency of everyday transactions. The Cuban government hopes that the measures will encourage exiles to send dollars to relatives, who will then convert the currency, possibly for dollar vouchers. In an effort to boost such revenues, Mr Castro said he would allow more visits to Cuba from Cubans living abroad. Under US law its citizens can give up to Dollars 300 a quarter to a relative in Cuba. The US State Department said Cuba's decision to legalise ownership of dollars would not affect these limitations. Mr Castro said the government would encourage 'all productive activities and services that generate convertible currencies', especially in tourism.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Sergey Chugayev: "Communists' Faction Announces </F> Strike"]    [Text] The practice of boycotting State Duma sessions  seems to be becoming traditional for legislators. Following the  Liberal Democratic Party of Russia [LDPR] and the "12 December"  group, at the 17 June plenary session the Communists' faction  resorted to this form of protest.    The faction's spokesman, G. Selezneyev, said at the start of  the session that the reason for the action was the "Pressa"  publishing house's decision to halt the publication of  SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA 16 June because of nonpayments. In the  deputy's opinion, the newspaper's debts arose with its temporary  closure after the events last October.    The representatives of the Communists' faction demanded that  members of the government be called to the session to give the  relevant explanations. As a result it was decided to instruct  Duma Deputy Speaker G. Chilingarov to investigate the matter.    The boycott by the Communists' faction and also the  generally  small number of deputies present at the session led to the point  where it proved very difficult to make any decisions.    In particular the Duma refused to include on the agenda the  question of acting General Prosecutor A. Ilyushenko's appeal on  the deprivation of V. Zhirinovskiy's rights as a deputy. In the  deputies' opinion, the acting prosecutor, in accordance with the  Constitution, does not have the right to send such documents to  the Duma. Only the general prosecutor has this right. The day  before the Duma council adopted the decision to send a  representation to the mandate commission for study. But some  deputies, representing mainly the "Russian path" group, saw in  this an element of compromise and attacked the Duma council,  demanding a vote of no confidence.    The proposal from Deputy Loginov to examine the question of  protecting MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI correspondent Zhilin who, the  deputy says, has been threatened with reprisal since the  publication of his article "Generals' Business" on abuses in the  Western Group of Forces did not get through either. On the  other hand, the deputies decided to examine once again how their  decisions on the creation of a parliamentary television and  radio company are being fulfilled.    The rejected motions also included the idea, put forward by  LDPR faction speaker V. Marychev, of sending an urgent telegram  to summon I. Rybkin, who is on an official visit in Germany, to  the session. Yet in the absence of the speaker on 17 June the  Duma set a kind of record. Debates around the agenda, which did  not lead to any serious changes to it, lasted exactly one hour  40 minutes.</p>

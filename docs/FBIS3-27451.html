			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Xie Zuan (6200 9449)] </F>   [Text] Hong Kong, 17 Feb (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--Shenzhen  Vice Mayor Li Chuanfang said on a public occasion in Hong Kong  this morning that the Sino-British row on Hong Kong's  constitutional affairs will not affect British consortia's  bidding for economic projects in Shenzhen.    Li Chuanfang said that to further improve transportation  facilities and meet the need of economic development, Shenzhen  has thoroughly begun preparation for building a subway system.  Because the subway system is a huge project which needs a large  amount of funds and technology, Shenzhen City Government  welcomes domestic and overseas consortia in bidding for the  projects of the subway.    A reporter asked whether the Sino-British row over Hong  Kong's constitutional affairs will affect British firms' bids  for those projects.    Li Chuanfang said that Shenzhen City Government will give  equal treatment to domestic and overseas consortia which are  interested in bidding for those as well as other construction  projects. She said that as far as she understands, economic and  political issues cannot be lumped together for discussion, and  that so long as the consortia meet the bidding requirements,  they may win the tenders.</p>

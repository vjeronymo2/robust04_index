			<p>941231 FT  31 DEC 94 / Labour prepares for minimum wage battle Labour is to put proposals for a minimum wage at the centre of its attack on the government's employment policies in a high-profile campaign planned for the new year. Party leaders believe that the campaign for a floor on earnings could hurt the government as much as Labour's effective attack on tax increases since the last general election. In a further challenge to the government's employment policies, Labour called for tougher job protection laws to prevent thousands of redundancies in the privatised utilities. Mr Ian McCartney, shadow employment minister, claimed that the privatised utilities plan to cut 66,100 jobs over the next five years, in addition to 127,841 redundancies since the privatisations took place. He said: 'This year will be remembered for the obscenity of huge pay rises for top executives, paid for with the jobs of loyal employees. It is the government's duty to defuse the job cuts bombshell waiting to go off in 1995. 'The government must make it plain that it is not acceptable for these utilities to lay people off just to give a short-term boost to the balance sheet.' The thrust of Labour's minimum wage campaign is set out in a letter to Labour MPs from Ms Harriet Harman, shadow employment secretary, and a close political ally of Mr Tony Blair, the Labour leader. According to the letter, Labour will argue that the UK's job creation record is inferior to that of several countries which have a minimum wage, including the US. The party will also seek support from employers by arguing that taxpayer-funded benefits such as family credit are subsidising low wages paid by unscrupulous companies. Ms Harman tells Labour MPs: 'We will be involving employers in the debate, many of whom treat their employees fairly, and do not want to be undercut by rogue employers.' Labour strategists believe the campaign for a minimum wage can be built on the party's successful defence of the Agricultural Wages Board, which was rescued from abolition following a consensus between employers and trade unions. Ms Harman says: 'We will be linking our arguments on the minimum wage with our concern that our economy can only prosper if we have a high-skill, high-tech, high-investment, high-productivity economy. 'In 1993 and 1994 we turned tax from an issue which the Tories used against us to one which is destroying them at the polls. We will do the same on the minimum wage.'</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Sergey Karmalito] </F>   [Text] Simferopol 25 May TASS -- Crimean President Yuriy  Meshkov welcomed the latest developments in relations between  the Crimea and Ukraine as hope-inspiring.    In an exclusive interview with ITAR-TASS on Wednesday [25  May], Meshkov said that the road to a compromise lies between  the search for mutual understanding through bilateral  negotiations and destructive policy pursued by Kiev.    Attempts by certain Ukrainian circles to provoke  confrontation in the Crimea have failed. The negotiation  process has been set in motion in order to bring together the  positions of the two sides and find solutions to the existing  problems and conflicts, Meshkov said.    He noted that Kiev continues its policy aimed at undermining  executive power in the Crimea and destabilising the situation in  the Republic.    Speaking about the decision to set up a working commission  of  Ukrainian and Crimean deputies to iron out disagreements,  Meshkov expressed hope that the reached "elementary  understanding" will be preserved.    "We have outlined an array of measures which both sides are  ready to carry out. This is a step forward towards solving the  existing problems," he added.    Asked about the Russian-Ukrainian talks on the Black Sea  Fleet, the Crimean leader stressed that it would be "somewhat  premature" to make assessments because there have been no  official reports about the results of the talks.</p>

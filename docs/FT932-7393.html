			<p>930524 FT  24 MAY 93 / Cambodians defy poll threat by Khmer Rouge guerrillas HUNDREDS of thousands of Cambodians, guarded by United Nations troops, flocked to vote yesterday in the country's freest and fairest election since independence from France 40 years ago. They braved the threat of attack by Khmer Rouge guerrillas, who have vowed to disrupt the polls, and were undeterred by torrential rain at the start of the monsoon season. In spite of at least three violent incidents, officials of the UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia (Untac) were jubilant about the electorate's enthusiasm and estimated that at least a third of the 4.8m registered voters went to the polls yesterday. The voting, which continues until Friday, is the culmination of a Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.20bn) UN operation to bring peace and democracy to Cambodia following an accord signed by the four main Cambodian factions in Paris in 1991. Cambodians will elect a 120-member assembly, which should draft a new constitution within three months and then give birth to a new government. The extreme leftwing Khmer Rouge was one of four parties to sign the Paris peace agreement, but it later reneged on the deal, refused to disarm its guerrillas and threatened to disrupt the election. 'I would say the Khmer Rouge have failed today,' said Mr Charles Twining, chief of the US mission in Cambodia. 'That simply leaves the Khmer Rouge in the forest.' Mr Yasushi Akashi, Untac chief, said the turnout was 'very, very gratifying', although he acknowledged that a fifth of Cambodian territory was inaccessible to Untac and the election process because of Khmer Rouge threats. The two main contenders in the election are the present communist administration - installed by Vietnam when it invaded and overthrew the brutal Khmer Rouge regime in 1979 - and Funcinpec, the royalist party which joined the Khmer Rouge in an uneasy alliance against the Vietnamese occupation until the 1991 peace agreement. Mr Chea Sim, leader of the governing Cambodian People's party, was greeted with silence when he arrived to vote at a sports stadium in the centre of Phnom Penh. But the crowd cheered when Prince Norodom Ranariddh, the Funcinpec leader, arrived at the same polling station. In the southern province of Kampot about 100 Khmer Rouge guerrillas briefly occupied a polling station, and fired into a ballot box. In Poipet on the Thai border, two voters were slightly injured when mortar rounds apparently fired by the Khmer Rouge exploded near a polling station. On Friday night, two Chinese UN staff were killed by what appears to have been a Khmer Rouge rocket aimed at a police station in Kompong Cham province. The attack was condemned by the UN Security Council. Tony Walker adds from Beijing: China also condemned the attack yesterday. Beijing's criticism did not refer directly to the Khmer Rouge, but this incident seems certain further to cool relations with its former close allies, and could even lead to a complete break.

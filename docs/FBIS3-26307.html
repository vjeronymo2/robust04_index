			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Hong Kong, Feb 7 (AFP)--China has decided to build  another nuclear power station a few kilometers (miles) from the  one it inaugurated Sunday in Daya Bay, near Hong Kong, the head  of France's national power company said Monday [7 February].  "What we have determined from this trip (to China) is that the  site for the plant is known. The Chinese government has clearly  made its choice known," Electricite de France (EDF) chairman  Gilles Menage said in Hong Kong.    "It will be situated practically in the same place -- three  or four kilometers from the existing site," he said. But he  added that the Chinese authorities have yet to spell out under  what terms the plant would be built. EDF played a major role in  building the 1,800-megawatt, twin-reactor Daya Bay complex, 50  kilometers (30 miles) from Hong Kong, and it is keen to play a  role in the new venture.    Publicly, China has yet to declare whether it will put the  long-mooted second Guangdong nuclear plant at Lingao, five  kilometers northeast of Daya Bay, or at Yangjiang, on the  western side of the province. "Each site has its own advantages  and disadvantages," the deputy head of public relations at Daya  Bay, Chen Zhenyu, said at Sunday's formal launch of Daya Bay's  first reactor, which Menage attended.    The central government in Beijing is said to prefer Lingao,  which independent-minded provincial leaders favor Yangjiang.  EDF, a French state company that is world's biggest generator  of electricity, was overall technical consultant at Daya Bay.  Its staff is staying on to oversee the training of its Chinese  personnel. Daya Bay's proximity to Hong Kong has aroused safety  concerns in the territory, but EDF executives say that since its  conception, Chinese officials have strived to match Western  safety standards.    Menage also said EDF was pursuing talks with Hong Kong's  biggest utility, China Light and Power Co. Ltd. -- which owns 25  percent of Daya Bay -- on a possible joint venture of their own  in China. "I believe that we may be able to say more in the  coming weeks," he said. Hong Kong press reports last October  said EDF and China Light were discussing a 2.5 billion US dollar  joint venture to erect three 1,200-megawatt electric power  stations in eastern Shandong province.</p>

			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / Letter: Danger to Baltic states of Sweden and Finland joining EC Sir, I read with interest the requirements for those central and east European countries that at present have associated EC status to become full members ('The Copenhagen summit', June 23). While it is relatively, if not entirely, straightforward to determine whether a particular country has achieved 'stability of institutions guaranteeing democracy, the rule of law, human rights . . .', it seems to me that the requirement to have achieved 'the capacity to cope with competitive pressure and market forces within the Union' is like the proverbial piece of string. I cannot but notice that one or two countries within the Union seem to be having a spot of trouble in this regard. I note further that, if Sweden and Finland join the EC, the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, which have associated status and are struggling to fulfil the requirements as set out in the declaration, may suffer. The fear is that the EC will force Sweden and Finland to cancel bilateral free-trade agreements with the Balts which have helped their economies to such a large degree since their independence.

The negotiating council in its session at Kempton Park  approved a package of concessions by the government and the ANC  [African National Congress] and also conceded, among others  things, to the extension of the nine provinces' powers. Inkatha  Freedom Party leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi insisted that the  concessions did not satisfy the alliance's objections. Gary  Alfonso reports:    The negotiating council in Kempton Park approved amendments  to the interim constitution which, according to the government  and the ANC, met the demands of the Freedom Alliance. In a  special concession the word "concurrent" was removed from the  constitution, which means that the central government may not  interfere with provincial powers, except when it was in national  interest. That, Dr. Buthelezi said, was not enough.    [Begin Buthelezi recording, in English] The powers of  regions  or provinces as defined in the present constitution are equal to  the powers of municipalities, when you talk about abattoirs and  gambling as such. To say that when you have not given real  regional powers in the first place, to say that you have now  removed... [pauses], you are not going to interfere with that --  it's neither here nor there, in fact it's nonsense. [end  recording]</p>

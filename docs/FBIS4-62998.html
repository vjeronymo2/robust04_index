On the last day of his official visit to  the Russian capital he met with Vladimir Shumeyko and Ivan  Rybkin, chairmen of the two chambers of the Russian Federal  Assembly.    During yesterday's talks, Martti Ahtisaari and Russian  President Boris Yeltsin discussed about 20 questions concerning  bilateral relations and international affairs.    "There are no political problems between Russia and  Finland;"  this is how Boris Yeltsin described the outcome of the talks.  Both countries' points of view on international problems,  including the Yugoslav crisis, coincide, he noted.    On Thursday, M. Ahtisaari had a meeting with Russian Prime  Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Longfin smelt disappeared from the Humboldt Bay estuary in the 1980s (Barnhart, pers. comm., 1993), perhaps as a result of a dramatic loss of intertidal marsh habitat, which may have reduced productivity levels to a point at which they could no longer support the species. In addition, the loss of freshwater flows from the Mad River, as a result of water diversions and land reclamation, may have contributed to the loss of this species from the Humboldt Bay.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Longfin smelt may be particularly sensitive to adverse habitat alterations or to stochastic events because their 2-year life cycle increases the likelihood of extinction after consecutive periods of reproductive failure due to drought or other factors. Relatively brief periods of reproductive failure could lead to extirpations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial information available regarding the past, present, and future threats faced by this species in this determination. This species does not appear to be threatened throughout all or a significant portion of its range or likely to become so in the foreseeable future. However, given the declines in the southern portion of the species' range and the general lack of population trend data for the remainder of its range, the Service will include the longfin smelt in category 2 of the next notice of review for animals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Though the petition was not limited to a portion of the species' range, the petitioner focused on the resident longfin smelt in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River estuary population. In telephone conversations, the petitioner indicated that he was most interested in a population listing. Longfin smelt numbers in this estuary have declined by 90 percent since 1984 and by 50 percent annually since 1987.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Service has listed vertebrate population segments where the entity being listed represented the entire coterminous United States population (e.g., marbled murrelet, grizzly bear). Some reproductively isolated (or nearly so) vertebrate population segments that are clearly important to the conservation of an entire species have also been listed under the Act (e.g., Mojave population of the desert tortoise, coastal population of the western snowy plover).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although the longfin smelt reportedly is unable to swim between estuaries (Moyle, pers. comm., 1993), unverified reports of offshore collections exist (Quirollo, pers. comm., 1993; Wing, pers. comm., 1993). Furthermore, the current distribution is thought to be the result of movements between estuaries that took place during the Pleistocene when lower sea levels reportedly would have enlarged estuaries along the Pacific coast and shortened the inter-estuarian distances (Moyle, pers. comm., 1993). Though geographically removed from the closest known extirpated or declining population (300 miles from the Eel River in California), this isolation does not necessarily indicate that the Sacramento-San Joaquin River estuary population is significant to a species that has a range of more than 1,900 miles. In addition, electrophoretic analysis revealed that the accumulated number of codon substitutions per locus (i.e., Nei's genetic distance) since the time of separation of the Sacramento-San Joaquin River estuary population and the longfin population in Lake Washington, Washington, connected to Puget Sound via a system of locks, has been small (0.005 according to Stanley  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> submitted to  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Copeia <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). Thus, these populations, separated by approximately 1,000 miles, have genetically diverged only slightly since their separation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Sacramento-San Joaquin River estuary is clearly an important and significant wetland ecosystem. The longfin smelt formerly was the fourth most abundant fish in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River estuary; however, the role of this declining species in the estuary today is unknown.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on this evaluation the Service has determined that the listing of the longfin smelt under the Act is not warranted at this time. The listing of the Sacramento-San Joaquin River estuary population of the longfin smelt is also not warranted at this time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> References  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A complete list of references used in the preparation of this finding is available from the Associate Manager_Endangered Species, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Portland, Oregon (see  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> section).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Authority  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The authority for this action is the Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1531  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 50 CFR Part 17  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Endangered and threatened species, Exports, Imports, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, and Transportation.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: December 22, 1993. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Richard N.

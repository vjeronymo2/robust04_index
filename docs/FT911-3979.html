			<p>910422 FT  22 APR 91 / UK News (Employment): Engineers will establish strike fund to bring in Pounds 1m a year ENGINEERING workers' ability to stage industrial action was enhanced at the weekend when the AEU union approved the establishment of a strike fund designed to raise more than Pounds 1m a year. Strike pay will rise from Pounds 25 a week to Pounds 30, with a possibility of more for special campaigns, and union leaders said yesterday that this was expected to rise significantly in future years. Adult members will be required to contribute 10p a week, taking their weekly union dues to Pounds 1.35. Mr Bill Jordan, AEU president, said the fund showed how the union was learning the lessons of the shorter working week campaign. In this, a levy by the Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions of members was instrumental in the unions winning a two-hour reduction in the 39-hour week for more than 500,000 workers. Mr Jordan said the new AEU fund meant that 'we will leave no doubt that, when we take employers on, we can put our money where our mouths are'. Mr Gavin Laird, general secretary, said the fund could be used in a drive for a 35-hour week or for other campaigns. Mr Laird said that during the past decade the union had spent Pounds 1m a year on average in dispute benefits, and expected similar amounts in future to be drawn from general funds. The strike fund would be separate. Of the Pounds 1.2m expected to be raised annually from it, Pounds 200,000 would be taken up by the increase of Pounds 5 to Pounds 30 in strike pay; the other Pounds 1m would be held for campaigns. This would be topped up if the union spent less than the Pounds 1m a year it expected on disputes not covered by the fund. The fund was approved by the union's rules revision body, meeting ahead of the annual conference which began yesterday in Eastbourne. The committee also approved the creation of three elected posts of women's officers to add to the one already in existence.</p>

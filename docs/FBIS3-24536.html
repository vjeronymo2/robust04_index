Akhrem, Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry,  Belarus Academy of Sciences, Minsk; UDC 577:152.3]    [Abstract] In a study of the in vitro resistance of varying  compositions of liposomes to phospholipase A[.sup]2[/], the  researchers used phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylglycerine,  phosphatidylinosite, phosphatidylethanolamine, and their  mixtures with sphingomyelin to prepare the liposomes. Liposome  stability was studied with liposomes consisting of an equimolar  mixture of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylglycerine in  phospholipase hydrolysis in the presence of cytochrome c,  cytochrome b[.sup]5[/], cytochrome P[.sub]450[/],  polylysine, and the histone H[.sup]1[/]. Twenty minutes after  the beginning of the reaction in the sphingomyelin-containing  liposomes, some 65 percent of the phosphatidylglycerine  remained. The amount of phosphatidylinosite left was 62 percent;  phosphatidylethanolamine, 55 percent; phosphatidylcholine, 50  percent. When phosphatidylglycerine was incorporated into the  liposomes, phosphatidylcholine content after processing with  phospholipase A[.sup]2[/] was 15-20 percent higher than in  control. The researchers found that the presence of the proteins  had a strong stabilizing effect on the components of binary  liposomes (with phosphatidylglycerine and phosphatidylcholine),  but virtually no effect on single-component liposomes. Binary  liposomes incorporating negatively charged phosphatidylglycerine  were found to be the most resistant to phospholipase  A[.sup]2[/]. That was attributed to the asymmetric  distribution of the phospholipids between the outer and inner  layers of the phospholipid vesicles. That the liposome surfaces  were screened by the proteins was viewed as possible, as was the  electrostatic interaction of positively charged proteins present  in the surrounding medium and the negatively charged lipid  component, which would partially protect the liposome from  lipolytic enzymes.

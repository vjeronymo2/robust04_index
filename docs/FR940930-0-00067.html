The authority citation for Part 199 continues to read as follows: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Authority:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 5 U.S.C. 301; 10 U.S.C. 1079, 1086. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Section 199.20 is revised as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;199.20 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Continued Health Care Benefit Program (CHCBP). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Purpose.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The CHCBP is a premium based temporary health care coverage program that will be available to qualified beneficiaries (set forth in paragraph (d)(1) of this section). Medical coverage under this program will mirror the benefits offered via the basic CHAMPUS program. Premium costs for this coverage are payable by enrollees to a Third Party Administrator. The CHCBP is not part of the CHAMPUS program. However, as set forth in this section, it functions under most of the rules and procedures of CHAMPUS. Because the purpose of the CHCBP is to provide a continuation health care benefit for the Department of Defense and the other Uniformed Services (e.g., NOAA, PHS, and the Coast Guard) health care beneficiaries losing eligibility, it will be administered so that it appears, to the maximum extent possible, to be part of CHAMPUS. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> General provisions.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Except for any provisions the Director, OCHAMPUS may exclude, the general provisions of section 199.1 shall apply to the CHCBP as they do to CHAMPUS. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Definitions.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Except as may be specifically provided in this section, to the extent terms defined in section 199.2 are relevant to the administration of the CHCBP, the definitions contained in that section shall apply to the CHCBP as they do to CHAMPUS. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Eligibility and enrollment <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ._(1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Eligibility.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Enrollment in the CHCBP is open to the following individuals: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Members of Uniformed Services, who: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) Are discharged or released from active duty (or full time National Guard duty), whether voluntarily or involuntarily, under other than adverse conditions; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) Immediately preceding that discharge or release, were entitled to medical and dental care under 10 U.S.C. 1074(a) (except in the case of a member discharged or released from full-time National Guard duty); and, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (C) After that discharge or release and any period of transitional health care provided under 10 U.S.C. 1145(a) would not otherwise be eligible for any benefit under 10 U.S.C. chapter 55. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) A person who: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) Ceases to meet requirements for being considered an unmarried dependent child of a member or former member of the armed forces under 10 U.S.C. 1072(2)(D); <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) On the day before ceasing to meet those requirements, was covered under a health benefits plan under 10 U.S.C. chapter 55, or transitional health care under 10 U.S.C. 1145(a) as a dependent of the member or former member; and, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (C) Would not otherwise be eligible for any benefits under 10 U.S.C. chapter 55. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) A person who: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) Is an unremarried former spouse of a member or former member of the armed forces; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) On the day before the date of the final decree of divorce, dissolution, or annulment was covered under a health benefits plan under 10 U.S.C. chapter 55, or transitional health care under 10 U.S.C. 1145(a) as a dependent of the member or former member; and, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (C) Is not a dependent of the member or former member under 10 U.S.C. 1072(2)(F) or (G) or ends a one-year period of dependency under 10 U.S.C. 1072(2)(H). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Effective date.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Except for the special transitional provisions in paragraph (r) of this section, eligibility in the CHCBP is limited to individuals who lost their entitlement to regular military health services system benefits on or after October 1, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

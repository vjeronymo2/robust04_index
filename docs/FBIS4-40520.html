			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondents Viktor Demidenko and </F> Mikhail Melnik]    [Text] Odessa 16 June TASS -- "Ukraine is ready to consider  the problems of the Black Sea navy by taking interests of the  Russian Federation into account, but the Russian Federation  should take into account Ukraine's interests, too," President  Leonid Kravchuk of Ukraine told servicemen of Ukraine's First  Aeromobile Division stationed in the Bolgrad district.    "The Russian Federation now admits that Crimea is a  constituent part of Ukraine. We are quite satisfied with this  approach. However, Ukraine should play a leading part in solving  the problems of the Black Sea Navy," Kravchuk said.    Touching upon differences between Russian and Ukrainian  approaches to these problems, Kravchuk pointed out that Ukraine  cannot accept the formulation which Russia wants to force upon  it, namely that Sevastopol is a base of the Russian Navy.    "Sevastopol cannot be a base of the Russian Navy," he said.  Ukraine proposes another formulation: "A base of the Russian  Navy in Sevastopol" rather than "the Sevastopol base of the  Russian Navy."    "The whole thing should be adopted in accordance with  international principles and agreements. Naturally, it may be a  matter of other bases of our country, too, where ships of  Russian and Ukrainian Navies may be placed," Kravchuk added.    When in the division's quarters, Kravchuk familiarized  himself with the servicemen's combat readiness, their way of  life and watched them taking part in demonstration exercises.    Kravchuk will leave Izmail for Odessa late at night.</p>

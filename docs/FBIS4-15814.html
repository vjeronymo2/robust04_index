			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [President Leonid Kravchuk statement in the "Without </F> Protocol" program -- recorded]    [Text] I hope that the elections will be valid. I am  analyzing yesterday's round -- 12 deputies were elected from 16  constituencies. It is preliminary information that has to be  checked [pauses]... Thus, we already have 90 deputies. Today,  over 350 will be elected. [passage indistinct] However, it  seems to me that the new Supreme Council will face a need  [pauses]... a need to determine its attitude toward the  elections on 26 June [presidential elections]. The problem is  not in holding or not holding the elections -- I have never  [words indistinct]. We have agreed to it, and adopted laws that  the elections must be held. However, in my opinion, the main  point is to elect an authoritative and strong power built on a  distinct legal basis. This is the main point. [pauses] In  order to explain this thesis, I will use one example regarding  the presidency. Having finally adopted a law on local  authorities, the [Supreme Council] session -- we will say it  openly -- restored a Soviet form of state management. We do not  need to discuss now whether this is good or bad. This is not  essential. [The session] has restored it -- it is a real fact.  Further, [the session] has ruined -- if the elections are to be  held under this law without any adopted amendments -- the  executive presidential power. Thus, at a local level, executive  presidential power already does not exist. If we are to elect a  president with the powers that he has today as head of state and  executive power, we will institute at the beginning -- on the  election level -- contradictions and a conflicting situation.  The president is being elected as head of executive power, but  there are no structures for executive power. Therefore, it is  not incidental that after the president had been elected, the  issue of the creation of presidential structures at local levels  emerged. The Soviet form of power was built distinctly --  lower-ranking bodies of power were subordinated to  higher-ranking ones without any restrictions; moreover, there  was also the Communist Party which, like a pivot, determined the  entire structure of subordination. Where the Soviet form of  distinct subordination did not exist, there was a distinct party  subordination. That is to say, it was a thought-over structure  [words indistinct] Now, this is ruined. If so, a question  emerges: Why elect a president as head of executive power if he  already has no structures -- to make him head of the Cabinet of  Ministers? But the Cabinet of Ministers is to be headed by the  prime minister, is it not? [unidentified voice answers --  Undoubtedly] Undoubtedly. Thus, the Supreme Council has to  determine which president must be elected. It is indispensable.  Without this, it will be an unnecessary waste of money and  [pauses] effort, which will not be followed by real  consequences. If the president is only the head of state, with  limited powers, because the Soviet form of power has already  been created [pauses]... In the Soviet form of power,  presidential executive [power] does not exist, and cannot exist.  It follows from polls [as heard] whether we have to elect a  president in nationwide elections. Why does it follow? But has  he been elected in nationwide elections? It was for the purpose  of confirming a strong executive power. By now, you see, we do  not have [this power] anymore. One more question. Let us take  the same law. You will see that it provides [pauses]... These  are representative bodies of power. However, they are delegated  with state authority -- at the local level, I mean. Rayons,  cities, and oblasts are delegated with state authority. What  authority and how much -- there is nothing about this issue. It  has been written that this will be determined by a separate law.  Then, such a question emerges: What percent [of the powers]  will be delegated -- 20 percent, or 30 percent? What percent  will be left to the government? If 70 percent of the state  powers are delegated, the government will be left with 30  percent. A question emerges: What kind of government must be  created -- with 40 ministries, or with 15? What powers will the  government have if the current structure is unnecessary due to  the delegation of state powers to rayons, oblasts, and cities?  I do not say that this is bad. Perhaps, it is good. However,  the Supreme Council must adopt a law on the delegation of powers  to the local authorities. It is written there that they will be  delegated by a separate law, but there is no such law. However,  the law on local self-government is in force. In accordance  with this law, lower-ranking bodies of power do not subordinate  to higher-ranking ones. Again, from the first days, there is no  legal and political clarity on how these bodies will work. The  last thing. I have even read it in a paper, or have seen it on  television that the law provides that the head of the executive  power may be dismissed by the Cabinet of Ministers. There is no  such provision there. This was in the draft. Someone has read  the draft. It is written there that if the head [of the  executive power] infringes, he may be dismissed from the post in  accordance with the law. Again, there is no law on it. This  way, it is necessary for the new Supreme Council to adopt, if we  do not want to be laughed at, I want to say it quite openly  [pauses]... I do not address it to someone personally, this is a  state building. Having resolved at the Supreme Council to build  a state according to Soviet [word indistinct] This is the right  of the Supreme Council. However, one need all institutes  [pauses]... all issues must be determined in accordance with  this structure, with regard both to the president and to the  Cabinet of Ministers, as well as to the powers delegated to  these bodies of power. If the Supreme Council convenes in late  April or in early May -- it is a realistic term -- and if all  these laws are adopted, then the Supreme Council will be able to  determine whether one needs to lose trillions for nationwide  presidential elections, or whether the president will be only a  representative figure, and there is no need for nationwide  presidential elections. That is why those who today are  considering running for the presidency have to ponder what  presidents they will be if the laws are not adopted. With  regard to my person, to my position, I do not want -- excuse my  words -- to discuss this issue until these laws are adopted.</p>

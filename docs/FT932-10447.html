			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets (America): US stocks little moved by jobs data Wall Street US share prices ended little changed in light trading yesterday in the wake of an April employment report that provided few clues to the current state of the economic recovery, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 4.71 at 3,437.19. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended down 0.95 at 442.31, while the Amex composite finished 0.89 lower at 426.06, and the Nasdaq composite up 1.40 at 681.44. Trading volume on the NYSE was 224m shares. All week investors had been sitting on the sidelines, awaiting the April jobs data that they hoped would provide fresh inspiration for stock markets that were badly in need of a new direction. Yesterday's employment report, however, proved to be a disappointment. The news that in April the civilian unemployment rate remained unchanged at 7 per cent and that non-farm payrolls rose by 119,000, slightly less than forecast, had no discernible impact on market sentiment. The markets were also hamstrung by concern about developments in central Europe. Investors seemed reluctant to commit themselves to the markets until President Bill Clinton had clearly indicated whether the US and its allies planned to intervene militarily to help the beleaguered Moslems in Bosnia. Among individual sectors, tobacco stocks, which have been hit hard in recent months on fears that a price war between the big US manufacturers would hurt earnings, rose on the news that RJR Nabisco has decided to discontinue offering smokers a discount on its cheapest brands of cigarettes. Philip Morris firmed Dollars 2 to Dollars 51 in volume of 5m shares, RJR rose Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 5 3/4 in volume of 4m shares, American Brands put on Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 32 1/4 , and Loews added Dollars 2 at Dollars 100 1/8 . Airline stocks ran into heavy selling, undermined by reports that Northwest Airlines had fired another shot in the air fare war. AMR, parent of American, fell Dollars 1 to Dollars 67 5/8 , UAL slipped Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 135 1/2 , and Delta gave up Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 57 1/8 . Gap Stores rose Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 33 7/8 in busy trading, after several Wall Street brokerage houses upgraded their rating on the retailer's stock in the wake of a rise in Gap's same-store sales during April. On the Nasdaq market, some technology issues were in demand. Lotus Development rose Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 32, Dell Computer added Dollars 3/8 at Dollars 32 1/4 , Borland International firmed Dollars 1 to Dollars 26 1/2 , and Intel put on Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 102. Canada TORONTO finished sharply lower in moderate dealings, dragged down by losses in forestry stocks and other natural resource firms. Of the TSE's 14 indices, 11 ended lower. Gold shares were among the few winners due to continued bullion gains. The TSE-300 Index fell 15.64 points or 0.41 per cent to 3,779.10. Declines led advances 388 to 327 with 286 unchanged.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: compiled by </F> Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy, edited by Vladimir  Shishlin]    [Text] In his interview with journalists in the Kremlin  leader of the communist party faction Gennadiy Zyuganov, who has  not signed the Agreement, declared that his presence at the  ceremony explains that he, in principle, supports the idea of  accord. He stressed that his faction in the State Duma is ready  to participate in the dialogue with those forces which would  sign the Agreement. Responding to Interfax, Zyuganov reported  about his intention to participate in the activity of "round  tables" and working groups on concrete problems, that is, in the  work of those mechanisms which have been mentioned in the  Agreement on Civic Accord.    According to Vladimir Lukin, one of the leaders of the  Yabloko faction, "a bad peace is better than a good quarrel,"  however, one should not sign this document because such a  non-democratic figure as Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, who heads a  non-democratic organization, would participate in its signing.  "Today he signs it and tomorrow he will piss on his signature,"  Lukin declared.    Amangeldy Tuleyev, chairman of the Kemerovo regional  council,  explained his refusal to sign the Agreement by his  non-confidence in the people who have initiated it, in  particular, in the government which, to quote Tuleyev, "has been  bogged down in corruption." "I believe that I would have  accomplished a disgraceful deed if I had signed this document,"  Tuleyev said.    During conversation with journalists the presidential press  secretary Vyacheslav Kostikov called the Agreement's signing  "the beginning of a mighty process of public reconciliation."  "Now the politicians are to implement everything what have been  done by representatives of the forces which are present here,"  he said.    Kostikov underlined: "The process is open and everybody who  wishes, who is mature enough, can sign it today, tomorrow, or in  half a year."    Sergey Shakhray, leader of the Party of Russian Unity and  Concord, declared that one should solve all problems at the  negotiations table but not on barricades. Secondly, it is  necessary that concrete protocols and decisions on concrete  problems, primarily in the sphere of economy, social protection,  and crime fighting, should follow this document.    Ingush President Ruslan Aushev called the articles on the  need to create mechanisms aimed at the implementation of the  decree on rehabilitation of repressed people is the most  important one in this Agreement.    For his part, leader of North Ossetia Akhsarbek Galazov  believes that the need to search for an efficient mechanisms to  achieve all- republican accord but not this concrete article is  the most important part of this document.    Tatarstan's President Mintimer Shaymiyev indicated that the  republic would join the Agreement on several provisions. In  particular, he said about Tatarstan's proposal to change the  name of the document and to entitle it Declaration on Civic  Accord. Shaymiyev expressed satisfaction with the fact that the  working group in charge for the preparation of this document had  taken into consideration Tatarstan's remark and removed the  provision stipulating that the republics' constitutions should  be brought in line with the Constitution of the Russian  Federation.    Leader of the Russia's Choice faction Yegor Gaydar believes  that signing of the Agreement represents a move in the right  direction, it has given a new impetus to the stabilization of  the political situation in Russia. "I have never had any  illusions that is it possible to solve serious problems of the  Russian life with the help of even a very important document,  but now, at last, there has appeared a base with the help of  which we can try to transfer the programmed confrontation from a  non-civilized into a civilized one."</p>

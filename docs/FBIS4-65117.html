			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial by Philippe Tesson] </F>   [Text] True to a time-honored show-business tradition,  Francois Mitterrand began staging his farewell show yesterday.  Judging from the show he offered the country, we can expect  some fine displays of seduction in the coming months. With  inimitable talent, the old star has begun casting its last rays  of light. Visibly, the president has determined to leave behind  him an image as flattering and as affable as possible, in  contrast to his real nature, which may be inferred from his  partisan past. Now that the end of his mandate is near, the  activist ideologue of the seventies and eighties, whose overt  goal was to change society, has now been replaced by a shrewd  man who has had an opportunity to gauge time, people, things,  and probably also his own ability to influence history. Truth  be told, Francois Mitterrand's pride has been sorely tried over  the last few years. What is left of his appetite for glory, if  not the deflated dream of Socialism triumphant, a few  grandiloquent building sites, and the crumbs of shared  authority? It is no accident that the only issue about which he  came across forcefully yesterday is that of nuclear testing; he  had no other topic through which he could show he still had some  power.    What was new was the fact that he did not systematically  resort to the one other power he made such liberal use of in the  past: sowing the seeds of discord. Such cordiality was out of  character, barely tinged with what irony was needed to show he  remains nobody's fool. But indeed, why fight when there is  nothing at stake, no more prize to be won? So Francois  Mitterrand quietly leaves the melee of current history.  Already, all he has to do is observe its games with amused  aloofness and controlled nostalgia. So he indulges in mild  jesting, and politics is reduced to a conversational topic. And  Francois Mitterrand is very eloquent. Ah, if only the program  could have lasted one or two hours longer! And his mandate two  or three extra years! But it is way too late now.    Francois Mitterrand's end will not be tragic. He was no born  hero. Had he been endowed with a little less pride and  intelligence, he would have preferred the image of a nice and  harmless old man. One has the feeling that, in the twilight  years, the temptation is there.</p>

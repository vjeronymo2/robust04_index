			<p><P> August 1, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PERSONAL HEALTH: BUFFALO MEAT GETS TOP BILLING IN HER DIET FOR LOW FAT, HORMONE  CONTENT;  </P> <P> YOUR BODY  </P> <P> Susan Laskin is not your typical throw-the-beefsteaks-on-the-barbie summer  hostess. Instead of picking up a few sirloins at the corner market, the North  Hollywood book researcher express-mails buffalo steaks from a San Francisco  game firm.  </P> <P> She's not aiming to win the avant-garde hostess of the year award, but to  improve the diet of her family and friends. She finds that buffalo has less  cholesterol, less fat and a lot fewer hormones than beef.  </P> <P> Healthful eating, not adventure, underlies the increasing demand for buffalo  meat, suppliers say. Orders are up from restaurants, gourmet markets and  consumers even though the price is steep. Buffalo burgers run about $5 a pound,  about twice the cost of beef hamburger; buffalo tenderloin can reach as high as  $17 a pound.  </P> <P> Certain cuts of buffalo have less than half the cholesterol of beef, claims  Mitch Niayesh of Polarica Game U.S.A., a San Francisco game and poultry  supplier. And buffalo can be half as fatty as beef, adds Lisa Senauke, manager  of the Game Exchange, also located in San Francisco.  </P> <P> But dietitian Nancy Becker is skeptical of the lower-cholesterol claim. "Almost  all meat, fish and poultry have similar amounts of cholesterol," says Becker,  chairman of the nutrition committee for the American Heart Assn.'s Greater Los  Angeles affiliate. "Each 3-ounce serving -- a portion about the size of a deck  of cards -- has 100 milligrams of cholesterol, a third the maximum daily intake  recommended by the American Heart Assn."  </P> <P> The lower-fat claim is easier for Becker to swallow: "Buffalo probably is much  leaner than beef. Fat contents between cuts of meat and types of animals can  vary widely." When figuring fat savings, be sure to compare similar cuts of  meat, she adds. "And if you like buffalo, enjoy."  </P> <P> </P> <P> For Healthier Babies  </P> <P> Taking time out between pregnancies doesn't just give Mom a breather. It might  also improve the chances of having a heavier -- and healthier -- baby.  </P> <P> That's the conclusion of a Harvard study of nearly 4,500 women, just reported  in the journal, Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology. Women who waited 18 months or less  between delivery and a subsequent conception were twice as likely to give birth  to a low-birth weight baby than mothers who waited 24 to 36 months. "The  highest risk (of small babies) was associated with the very shortest interval,"  says Dr. Ellice Lieberman, assistant professor of maternal and child health at  the Harvard University School of Public Health. "Especially at risk were those  with less than a three-month pregnancy interval."  </P> <P> In the study, babies were considered small if their weight fell below the tenth  percentile. Statistically, small babies have a higher risk of infant death and  illness.  </P> <P> The study may not apply to everybody. "If a woman has the luxury of time on her  side, it may be better to wait awhile between pregnancies," says Dr. Charles M.  March, USC professor of obstetrics and gynecology. "But women over 35 have to  weigh the risks of having small babies against such risks as giving birth to a  Down's syndrome baby."  </P> <P> Dr. William A. Frumovitz, an obstetrician-gynecologist at St. John's Hospital  and Health Center in Santa Monica, calls the research intriguing but won't  change his advice to prospective parents: "Assuming the woman has no health  problems, deciding intervals between pregnancies is more a matter of family  preference."  </P> <P> </P> <P> A Sleep Eye-Opener  </P> <P> As people age, the phrase "sleeping like a baby" may become more like a fairy  tale than a real bedtime story.  </P> <P> Relax, sleep researchers say. Even good sleepers should expect their sleep  patterns to change with advancing birthdays. What's realistic? At age 30, a  good sleeper might expect to drop off in about 10 minutes, stay asleep all  night and wake up refreshed, says Michael Stevenson, the clinical director of  the North Valley Sleep Disorders Center in Mission Hills. But at age 60, even a  good sleeper might take a half hour to fall asleep, awaken several times during  the night and sometimes get up tired.  </P> <P> Depressing as that may sound, here's heartening advice, especially for older  slug-a-beds: Lolling in bed an extra hour or so, even if you doze on and off,  may improve daytime alertness, Stevenson says.  </P> <P> Not a bad idea, agrees Dr. Philip Westbrook, a sleep expert at Cedars-Sinai  Medical Center, as long as you can spare the time and you don't overdo it. "A  little extra time in bed leads to more sleep, even if you think you won't  sleep," he finds. "But avoid overkill.Don't try, for instance, to get eight  hours of sleep by spending 12 in bed."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Iron and Athleticism  </P> <P> Iron deficiency often strikes women, causing fatigue and anemia, but it can  also affect very active men. In a recent study, Canadian researchers found the  more frequently male athletes worked out, the lower their blood level of this  essential mineral, regardless of theamount of iron-rich foods they consumed.  </P> <P> Iron deficiency is still rare in men, observes Rodney Bassett, exercise  physiologist at Centinela Hospital's Fitness Institute in Culver City, but he  has found it in long-distance runners who log 40-60 miles a week, don't eat  much red meat and are trying to reduce body fat.  </P> <P> Athletic men who follow an intense training regimen or who experience  unexplained fatigue, should ask their doctors to check for iron deficiency,  Bassett and the Canadian researchers agree.  </P></p>

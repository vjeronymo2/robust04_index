			<p>940312 FT  12 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Pharmakopius flotation postponed The planned flotation of Pharmakopius International has been postponed because of 'volatility' in the biotechnology sector. Originally planned for February 16, the flotation had already been pushed back and yesterday the company admitted it had been shelved 'for the time being'. It insisted that the decision did not reflect lack of interest in Pharmakopius itself from potential investors. 'The interest is there, but a number of institutions are getting nervous about the sector.' It pointed to the recent flotation of Chiroscience, a biotechnology company whose Pounds 100m valuation was criticised as too high by some analysts. But at 147p Chiroscience's shares are only 3p below the issue price, and other shares in the sector, notably British Bio-technology, have performed well in recent weeks. The company scotched rumours that it had failed to meet the Stock Exchange requirements for a listing. Unlike many biotechnology companies Pharmakopius has a profitable trading record.</p>

			<p><P> April 12, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> HER OWN FAN CLUB;  </P> <P> PADRE CATCHER PARENT FINDS IT'S HIS TURN TO SUPPORT OLD FRIEND  </P> <P> The old lady and the kid. That's what they were to each other.  </P> <P> Mark Parent was a runny-nosed 17-year-old baseball player who never should have  left his high school coach, or his mother. Rhoda Polley was a retired legal  secretary who had agreed to join the Padre front office as a general manager's  assistant, sorting contracts, filing papers and, most of all, watching over  kids such as Parent.  </P> <P> The year was 1979; his first, her first.  </P> <P> Remembers Parent: "She was the one person in the front office you could talk  to."  </P> <P> Remembers Polley: "He was the one who received about four perfumed letters  every day from his girlfriend. After delivering all those, I'm glad she finally  became his wife."  </P> <P> A couple of years passed, and it became obvious that the old lady and the kid  were not that much different. They were both role players, little-known  reserves. Neither was going to be made a millionaire by this game. Neither was  going to be famous.  </P> <P> Parent was a solid catcher missing the required flash. Every year he showed up  and played hard. But if the Padres ever noticed, they had a funny way of  showing it, running off to Latin America to sign more catchers than they now  know what to do with.  </P> <P> Polley learned the inner mechanisms of the game and became as much of an expert  on front office rules as any general manager. But her general manager became  Jack McKeon, and although he constantly tried to pass on the credit, he became  the folk hero, and she became the one lost in all that cigar smoke.  </P> <P> So the old lady and the kid formed a bond. They never talked about it, never  wrote anything down -- it was just there.  </P> <P> Once, when Parent was fed up with minor league life and decided to quit, Polley  talked him out of it. She then made a habit of sending along sweet notes every  winter with his contract, assuring him that he was being paid fairly, assuring  him he would one day make the big leagues. He would see her every spring  training. He would wave to her in the stands, stay late talking to her in the  offices, promise her that yes, one day he would make it to the big leagues.  </P> <P> And today, Mark Parent has made it. He is beginning his second major league  season as one of the better backup catchers in baseball. Soon his contracts  will be done in big negotiations with big agents, and all sweet notes will cost  extra.  </P> <P> But there's something missing. It's the old lady. Last week, the day after  another season opened, Rhoda Polley unwillingly resigned from the Padres at age  65 to concentrate on a battle with a cancer that is spreading through her body.  </P> <P> You might remember Polley from opening day. She was the woman being helped to  the pitching mound before the game by Parent, Garry Templeton and Tim Flannery.  She's the woman you've never heard of who threw out the first ball. George Bush  did it in Baltimore, the old lady did it in San Diego.  </P> <P> Mark Parent would like you to hear about her. Hours after her resignation, he  hit a home run against the San Francisco Giants. As he crossed the plate into  the warm arms of teammates and loud cheers of fans, there was only one thing he  could think of. Is Rhoda watching?  </P> <P> "I was home, trying to watch on TV, but my sleeping pills got me, and I was  sleeping," Polley said the next day. "But I still saw him. I don't need to be  watching Mark to see him."  </P> <P> Parent hopes she keeps watching. The kid has dedicated his season to Polley. He  figures she would do the same for him. That is, if she hasn't already done the  same for him.  </P> <P> Rhoda Polley's story is a simple one. She was baseball fan, grew up in San  Diego, became so enamored that she and her husband bought a house five minutes  from the ballpark so she could walk to the games.  </P> <P> Her husband died in 1974. She retired from her job as a legal secretary and  became a baseball freak. She had no children, so she saw the Padres as her  children. She attended every spring game, every home game. She became one of  those fan fixtures who attach themselves to every club . . . and then in the  spring of 1979, Bob Fontaine, then the general manager, suddenly plopped down  next to her in the Yuma box seats.  </P> <P> "He said he needed a secretary, somebody to help out," Polley remembers. "I  asked him, when do I start?"  </P> <P> She has since been through seven managers, three club presidents and two  full-time general managers. Her job was, among other things, to mail the  contracts and keep track of the incentive clauses in those contracts. She once  worked out the language in Alan Wiggins' guaranteed contract so that it made so  much sense, it was sent to the Players' Assn. as a model.  </P> <P> Oh yes, and she played mother to the Padres' minor leaguers.  </P> <P> "I got into a fight with a manager in double-A in 1982, and they wanted to  suspend me, and then send me down, and I told them to stick it," Parent  recalled. "I was on my way to quitting . . . and then Rhoda called. She told me  I was better than that. She told me I was blowing my one chance. She wanted me  to act like a man."  </P> <P> Recalled Polley: "I gave him this speech, and all he said was, 'Yes ma'am.' "  </P> <P> So Parent took the demotion to Class-A Salem. By the next year, he was back in  double A. And from then on, they shared a trust.  </P> <P> "She was a person in the front office I always believed," Parent said. "She  treated me like I was no different than Dave Winfield. During spring training,  she would holler at me from the stands, which was nice when you had nobody  else. She was much better for me than I ever was for her."  </P> <P> "Oh, but was like one of my sons," Polley said. "He treated me like I was  special."  </P> <P> That's why she fretted this winter when, after being diagnosed with cancer, she  could not reach Parent in the Dominican Republic, where he was playing winter  league. It wasn't until Parent returned to the United States in January and  called her about spring training reservations -- and the annual players' pool  tournament she sponsors in Yuma -- that he heard the news.  </P> <P> "It was funny, but she told me, and it was like I couldn't get her off the  phone fast enough," Parent said. "She told me I was the last person she would  tell, and it got all emotional, and I could tell it was killing her, so I  wanted her to hang up.  </P> <P> "I've never had anybody around me sick like this. I'm not sure how to handle  it."  </P> <P> The Padres showed how they handled it on opening day, when Polley threw out the  ball at owner Joan Kroc's request. After an off-season spending spree that  might put the Padres in contention, Kroc could have made the pitch and probably  still be hearing the cheers.  </P> <P> "But they asked me instead, and I got so excited," Polley said. "Imagine me,  throwing out a first ball."  </P> <P> "It's the least we can do," McKeon said. "Rhoda has constantly made my job  easier. I was a rookie general manager, and she guided me through the hard  times. I remember, and we all remember.  </P> <P> "If we get lucky enough to make the playoffs or World Series, you bet your life  she'll be right there with us. Even if I have to carry her there."  </P> <P> Despite needing help reaching the mound opening night, it was Polley who  carried the three players when, while still on the mound, they were surprised  by the loud noise from surprise pregame cannon shots.  </P> <P> "We heard this boom, and all of us jumped, but Rhoda," Parent said. "We all  hung on to her."  </P> <P> "Wrong," Polley said. "We hung on to each other."  </P> <P> Said Parent: "You have to understand, I really can't tell her I'm dedicating  this season to her. I don't know how to do it."  </P> <P> He paused. "Maybe I can just show her. I show her, she'll know."  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Report on LOS TIEMPOS staff interview with Minister of the </F> Presidency Carlos Sanchez Berzain in La Paz by Eddy de la  Quintana; date not given]    [Text] La Paz (LOS TIEMPOS)--One of the basic goals that  the current administration intends to achieve in its four-year  term is to lay the groundwork for Cochabamba to become the  nation's largest and most important development pole, owing both  to its resource potential and to its central location. It will  thus be able to greatly spur growth in several other regions of  the country.    This goal was set forth by the minister of the presidency of  the republic, Carlos Sanchez Berzain, who spoke at length with  the LOS TIEMPOS editorial staff in the city of La Paz during a  working breakfast, touching in particular on several facets of  the status of, problems in, and projections for regional  development in the Department of Cochabamba.    After indicating that this major region of the country was  "constantly deceived during the four years of the previous  administration," the minister, who prides himself on being a  genuine and dedicated representative of Cochabamba in the  Executive Branch, noted that the political and historical  process that the country is now undergoing raises hopes that  this department can become a major center for generating and  spurring national development.    "Cochabamba must regain the leadership that it has had in  various spheres of national life throughout the history of the  republic," the minister of the presidency stated optimistically.  <H5>  The Myth of Misicuni </H5>   During their conversation Berzain and the editors of LOS  TIEMPOS gave lengthy consideration to the multipurpose Misicuni  project, which various segments of the population in Cochabamba  and nationwide see as the major one for promoting regional  development.    "Misicuni is no doubt the project that has been talked up  the  most, the one that has been inaugurated most often, and the one  that has always been manipulated politically by various parties,  without anything definite ever having been done to realize it in  the short or medium term," the minister of the presidency  contended.    He reported that so far real sources of financing for the  project have not been firmed up. He recalled that as the  previous administration (former President Jaime Paz Zamora's)  was drawing to a close, it merely started trying to secure a  loan from the Italian Government so that it could begin work on  part of the first stage of diverting the Serketa and Titiri  rivers. This stage was also manipulated politically for  clear-cut vote-getting purposes.    He said that President Sanchez de Lozada's administration  has  continued these efforts, and an official response from the  Italian Government is expected in February or March of next year.    He explained that the current administration's policy is to  preserve the multipurpose nature of the Misicuni Project, which  is regarded as a national priority. To this end, it will be  included as an essential component of the package of programs  that will be submitted to the Consulting Council of the World  Bank that will be meeting from 8 to 10 December in Washington.  The administration will also negotiate a line of credit with the  Inter-American Development Bank for the hydroelectric component  of the project.    He indicated, however, that "the first signs that the  Misicuni Project is solving the problem of drinking and  irrigation water are not expected to be seen for about five  years." He thus said that there was an urgent need to develop  alternative solutions that can be implemented quickly.  <H5>  Water Wells </H5>   After indicating that the shortfall in drinking water  supplies for the Cochabamba population is about 400 liters per  second, Sanchez Berzain reaffirmed that the administration is  determined to find quick solutions to this disturbing problem.    In this connection, he reported that the administration has  decided to give additional support to SEMAPA. It has pledged  $300,000, $100,000 of which has already been disbursed, to  harness water in the El Paso zone, where it expects to obtain an  extra 107 liters a second for Cochabamba.    He also mentioned the important technical studies that are  being conducted with France's cooperation on drilling new wells  to harness deep waters with the precautions necessary to prevent  environmental damage in the region.    He announced that the overall 1994 budget would include  $800,000 for these drilling projects and for the expansion and  renovation of the systems that distribute drinking water to the  city of Cochabamba.    He noted that "all this will be done without putting aside  Misicuni at any time, but as President Sanchez de Lozada said,  we are going to crow only after the egg has been laid."  <H5>  Oil Region </H5>   Another topic that Minister Carlos Sanchez discussed during  his talk with LOS TIEMPOS at the seat of government was  Cochabamba's membership in the club of departments that have  traditionally produced hydrocarbons, such as Santa Cruz,  Chuquisaca, and Tarija.    He indicated that although Cochabamba's history as a  potential hydrocarbons-producing region goes back many years,  the department was long neglected because of the deceit of  previous administrations and interference by certain sectors  from other regions of the country.    He pointed out that the situation has now been completely  reversed, as Cochabamba looks to become the second largest  fossil fuels producing department in 1994 and the largest in  1995.    Sanchez noted that these projections, which President  Sanchez  de Lozada recently underscored on his visit to the Bulo Bulo oil  field, represent a fundamental short-term change for the  department of Cochabamba, which is taking shape as a major  center of national development.    He announced that the 1994 budget appropriates around $103  million for oil exploration and development projects in that  department. He also gave assurances that the Carrasco-Valle  Hermoso multipurpose pipeline would be completed, adding that  there is a $23 million credit line for this purpose as part of  the investment program totaling $77 million.  <H5>  Export Center </H5>   The administration's overall plans for the regional  development of Cochabamba also include turning the city's air  terminal into one of the country's main export centers,  especially in connection with nontraditional goods with value  added.    "We want to turn Cochabamba into the country's major  aeronautical center," he said, adding that for this purpose the  offices of the president and senior executives of Lloyd Aereo  Boliviano have been ordered transferred to that city.    He indicated that the new air terminal for passengers and  freight may open in February of next year. He reaffirmed that as  of then we can start building a major center for the export of  processed foods, fruits, and other items and promote greater  exports of various manufactured goods and handicrafts.  <H5>  The Coca Problem </H5>   Berzain was equally optimistic about the problem of excess  coca production in the tropical region of Cochabamba, which some  opinion groups see as a hindrance to the department's regional  development. He felt that the problem was on the way to a  solution.    "The excess production of coca is an economic problem that  has an economic solution," he said, adding that the  administration is bent on promoting programs to improve social  conditions in the neglected rural areas of that department and  other regions of the country to prevent large groups of peasants  from moving into the Chapare.</p>

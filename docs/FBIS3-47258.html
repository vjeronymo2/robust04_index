			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Ministry of Defense Joint Chiefs of Staff [JCS]  has virtually made a decision on the procurement of the aircraft  for the 500 billion won [$625 million] electronic warfare  aircraft project (Kumgang Parktu Project). Production is  expected to be suspended in 1994 and suspicion has been raised  within the military of possible mishandling of the project.    The JCS held a meeting of the Arms Systems Deliberation  Committee on 30 December last year and decided on three types of  aircraft as the final ones for negotiation after three years of  pondering. The three types of aircraft are: one large  aircraft, the French Dassault Falcon 50; and two medium-size  aircraft, BAE-125 built by U.S. Raytheon and Citation III built  by U.S. Cessna.    However, since the two medium-size aircraft fall short of  the  performance necessary for military operations required by the  user unit, such as payload capacity and duration of flight, the  procurement of Falcon 50 has virtually been decided.    The Falcon 50 the JCS has decided to procure has never been  developed for military use and its production is supposed to be  suspended this year. Moreover, the large Canadian Challenger  jet, which has been developed for military use, has been dropped  from the list of aircraft to be negotiated on, arousing doubt  within the military about the decisionmaking process. The  Defense Security Command, therefore, is reported to have  undertaken an investigation of the case.    The electronic warfare aircraft project is supposed to  procure eight reconnaissance planes from 1996 through 1999 so as  to take over the role of the reconnaissance unit of the U.S.  forces in the ROK which will be withdrawing toward the end of  the nineties.    According to Defense Ministry and JCS officials, the JCS  excluded the Canadaire Challenger--which had already been  developed and in use for intelligence purposes in 1989 when the  JCS began to push ahead with the project--from the prospective  list of procurement from the outset. Instead, the JCS included  in the list only the Falcon 50, and the two medium-size aircraft  which are incapable of competition as they fall short of the  performance required for military operations.    In response to the decision, the Canadian Government sent a  letter through the Canadian Embassy in Seoul in 1991 to then  Defense Minister Choe Se-chang protesting the exclusion of the  Challenger, which was the only model in the world developed for  military reconnaissance purposes [as published] and was used in  the Gulf war. Minister Choe ordered Vice Minister Kwon Yong-hae  to include the Challenger and make a new presentation.    The Defense Ministry and JCS officials, however, said the  JCS  disregarded the order for nearly three years and suddenly held  the Arms Systems Deliberation Committee meeting at the end of  last year, right after former Minister Kwon was replaced, and  decided to negotiate on the Falcon 50 and two medium-size  models, excluding the Challenger again. The officials said that  because of the decision, the Falcon is almost certain to be  selected as the final model beating the medium-size models.    According to the officials, before the Arms Systems  Deliberation Committee meeting was held in early December 1993,  the working-level meeting of the project had notified the  deliberation committee members of its conclusion that the  medium-size models were not appropriate and that the Challenger  should be selected.    The officials said that it was suspected from the beginning  that the decision makers wanted to select Falcon 50 by including  in the list Falcon 50 and the two medium-size models and  excluding the Challenger, because a large-size reconnaissance  aircraft was the one they needed.    A high-ranking JCS official said, "The Arms Systems  Deliberation Committee made the decision by vote of its members  on the judgment that the performance comparison presented by the  user unit was right.</p>

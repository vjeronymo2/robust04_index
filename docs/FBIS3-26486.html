Provincial party and government leaders (Luo Haifan), Wu  Xiangdong, Zhu Dongyang, and Zhou Shichang attended the meeting.    Secretary Wang Maolin said: Only if they study in depth and  implement well the guideline laid down by the Third Plenary  Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, do a good job in  studying and publicizing Volume 3 of the Selected Works of  Deng Xiaoping, and persist in arming the armed police force  fighters and officers with the theory of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics and in applying this theory to the  operation and development of the armed police force, will our  armed police units -- as an armed force defending our cause of  socialist modernization -- be able to uphold unswervingly the  principle of absolute party leadership over the Army and thus  more efficiently undertake the historical mission entrusted by  the 14th party congress of defending reform and opening up, and  of safeguarding economic construction.    Secretary Wang Maolin asserted in particular that the  general  situation in the province is good at present. Last year, the  province achieved great successes in all aspects, he said.  However, there are still quite a few unstable factors in the  community. Therefore, armed police units at all levels are  expected to firmly bear in mind that their essential duties are  to perform routine duties and to carry out emergency operations,  constantly heighten their sense of police duty, step up the  reform of the official duty system, and improve their efficiency  in performing duties. The armed police force must carry forward  the fine tradition of the Army; vigorously support and play an  active part in the province's reform, opening up, and economic  construction; and take action to contribute to the development  and prosperity of Hunan Province.</p>

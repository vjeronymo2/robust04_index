			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Press release" issued "early this week" by Lao-American </F> Joint Technical Team]    [Text] Implementing the humanitarian policy of Lao  People's Democratic Republic [LPDR] Government, between 9 March  and 3 April 1993, the Lao-American Joint Technical Team jointly  carried out an operation in Houa Phan and Xieng Khouang  provinces. During the joint operation, technicians from both  sides conducted excavations at four points: points 0079 and 0690  in Viangsai District, Houa Phan Province, and point 1452 in Kham  District and point 1482 in Pek District, Xieng Khouang Province.  In addition to the excavations, the technical team investigated  23 plane crash cases in various districts in these two provinces.    Along with the site surveys and excavations, Lao technicians  led their U.S. counterparts to find out about American nationals  whom the U.S. side believes to be still alive in Viangsai  District and Phoupha area, Houa Phan Province, and at Ban  village and Het District, Xieng Khouang Province. The  investigation was made at the request of the U.S. side, and is  aimed at helping the families of American MIA's and the U.S.  Government answer questions about whether there are still  Americans alive in the LPDR.    NBC and ABC television reporters accompanied the technical  team during these joint operations to collect news and observe  the cooperation between the two sides.    This is the fourth joint Lao-U.S. operation carried out in  the 1994 fiscal year. The results of this operation has been  considerably good. The U.S. has highly appraised the  achievements of the operation. It has also expressed its  appreciation to the Lao Government and people for their good  cooperation and flexibility, despite the fact that up to this  fiscal year the U.S. has not given any humanitarian aid to  Laos, which has all along fulfilled its obligations effectively.</p>

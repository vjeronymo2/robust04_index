			<p>930215 FT  15 FEB 93 / Legislative programme may be slimmed for next session THE government's business managers are preparing for a clampdown on the amount of legislation being planned for the next session. Mr Tony Newton, the leader of the Commons, and the government whips are getting ready to warn ministers that some controversial bills will have to be rejected to avoid overloading the programme. The government's managers believe that the impact of having to deal with an overall majority of only 21 has not been fully recognised in ministers' legislative plans, partly because it has been obscured by the peculiar circumstances of the Maastricht bill this session. They also believe that the move to a unified Budget and spending statement in December could have an adverse impact on the programme. Unless the new session starts early in November, there is a danger that the combination of a week's debate on the Queen's speech at the start of the session, followed by a week-long debate on the Budget will delay discussion of individual bills. Officials in the Cabinet Office are holding meetings with departments to try to weed out some of the more unlikely bills before ministers have a preliminary discussion of the programme, probably later this month. The main departmental bids include: A banking bill, proposed by the Treasury, mainly to take account of recommendations in the wake of the Bingham inquiry into the collapse of BCCI. Legislation to reform agricultural landlord and tenant law. A comprehensive 'green' bill, urged by Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary. It would set up a unified environmental protection agency, and might also include provisions to introduce market instruments such as tradeable permits. But as departments have to bid for numbers of clauses as well as the number of bills, the government's business managers may well try to cut its size. A pensions bill proposed by the social security department. It would deal with the equalisation of the pension age, as well as changes to occupational pensions law recommended by the Goode committee. A bill to deregulate London buses. Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, may also press for provisions to make local authorities sell their airports, if too few of them do so voluntarily. For Scotland, the main legislation would be to implement the government's decisions on water privatisation and re-organising local government. There is also a suggestion that the 'stock-taking' exercise, on which a white paper is expected shortly, might require a small bill A bill from Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, to privatise British Coal. He also wants a bill to simplify the law on trademarks and one to reform restrictive practices and trades description law. Two large bills from Mr John Patten, the education secretary. One to reform teacher training, making the courses more classroom-based; and one to make membership of the National Union of Students voluntary. A bill to put the security and intelligence services on a statutory footing A handful of bills from Mr Kenneth Clarke, the home secretary. A police bill and reform of the Sunday trading law are the main elements, but he is also pressing for a criminal justice bill. If he fails to persuade his colleagues that the bill on the boundary changes to take account of the extra six seats for the European elections should be dealt with in the current session, that will be a priority for the next legislative programme.</p>

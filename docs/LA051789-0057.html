			<p><P> May 17, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THEIR SCHOOLS CLOSED BY ISRAEL, WEST BANK YOUTHS ATTEND SECRET CLASSES  </P> <P> The young Palestinians and their aging mentor exchanged illegal information  behind the drawn curtains of a private living room.  </P> <P> "The white dog is nice," a teen-ager named Tamer said.  </P> <P> "The black dog is nicer than the white dog," a colleague named Rima said  hesitantly.  </P> <P> "The red dog is the nicest!" Hamed concluded, with an eager wave of the hand.  </P> <P> The three are high school students trying to keep up their English lessons in a  clandestine school run by Palestinians in this hilltop town near Bethlehem.  </P> <P> For most of the past 17 months, Israel has kept all schools in the West Bank,  public and private, closed on grounds that they would otherwise breed unrest  associated with the Arab uprising.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Hidden Classes  </P> <P> In order to keep the 320,000 students from falling hopelessly behind in their  studies, Palestinians are organizing hidden classes.  </P> <P> These have also been declared illegal, even though teachers and parents  generally keep the students quiet so as not to attract army patrols on the  lookout for such activity. Such is the concern for secrecy that a reporter  spent months asking before being admitted to one of the classes.  </P> <P> Israeli troops recently raided college science classes in Ramallah that were  being taught by professors from Birzeit University, which has been closed for  more than a year. There was no indication from the government announcement of  the raid that the students had done anything but carry on a normal course of  study.  </P> <P> The United Nations, which operates 98 schools in Palestinian refugee camps in  the West Bank, complained recently that the Israeli government had prohibited  its teachers from holding first- through third-grade classes in the homes of  children as a temporary measure to keep them learning.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Not Issue of Security  </P> <P> Israeli officials do not base the banning of secret schools on the issue of  security. Rather, they express concern that a separate system will arise  outside their control, one in which Palestinian nationalism would be assumed if  not taught outright.  </P> <P> Reading, writing and revolution are not in the authorized curriculum.  </P> <P> "We do not oppose a few parents teaching their children some lessons at home,"  Shmuel Morad, the military governor of Nablus, said. "There has to be  supervision by the proper authorities. It cannot be directed by politically  oriented people of the uprising."  </P> <P> As to the possibility of reopening the schools, Morad said, "There is no way to  open schools."  </P> <P> Israel's insistence on keeping the Arab schools closed has drawn fire from  international human rights groups and recently from a group of Israeli  professors who see it as ironic that Jews, a people taught to venerate  education, should deny education to others, even in the midst of a violent  conflict.  </P> <P> "We are of the opinion that a step that may have been justified as a short-term  emergency measure at the beginning of the uprising has become intolerable as a  long-term measure," the professors wrote. "It is crucial that acts done in our  name should be consistent with our declared values."  </P> <P> Palestinian educators are planning to circulate a petition among foreign  diplomats in Jerusalem requesting that their countries halt educational  exchanges with Israelis so long as Israel keeps Arab schools closed.  </P> <P> The United States has asked Israel privately to take "confidence-building  measures" to try to ease tension in the West Bank and Gaza Strip but has  stopped short of pressing for a reopening of the schools.  </P> <P> In the meantime, some Palestinian parents take pains to get their children to  "popular schools," with classes dispersed in homes, offices, mosques and  churches.  </P> <P> For fear of being found out, children carry their books not in the customary  knapsack but in plastic grocery bags topped with bunches of mint or grape  leaves for camouflage. Tamara, an 11th-grader in Beit Sahur, recalled the day  soldiers forced her to return home when they found English books in her bag.  </P> <P> "I said, 'These are not rocks,' " she related. "They said, 'It doesn't matter,  they are illegal.' "  </P> <P> Beit Sahur is a middle-class town with numerous teachers, and many of its  residents are parents who want to see their children educated.  </P> <P> In other, more remote places, where learning would be a struggle in the best of  times, education has come to a virtual standstill. For example, in Kfar Malek,  near Ramallah, 8- and 9-year-olds spend their days not trying to fathom  arithmetic but standing guard on hilltops to watch for roving Israeli army  patrols.  </P> <P> With some embarrassment, street organizers in Kfar Malek admitted that little  is being done there to further the children's education. They pointed out that  teachers would have to come from Ramallah, and are reluctant to do so for fear  of being found out. Teachers are in the pay of the Israeli government while the  schools are closed.  </P> <P> "We can't get anyone to come teach, and we ourselves are not really very well  educated," said Mustafa, a village youth who has been in prison on four  occasions for throwing stones.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Can Read Graffiti  </P> <P> Idle children in the main plaza demonstrated a peculiar result of the lack of  education: They could read the nationalist graffiti scrawled on the walls of  houses and stores but were hard-pressed to recite from an elementary science  book produced by a local storekeeper.  </P> <P> Palestinian educators view such an imbalance in the learning of youngsters as  one of many disasters visited upon the children.  </P> <P> "A whole generation could come out illiterate," school counselor Rana  Nashashibi warned. "We are witnessing an enormous drop in IQ scores.  Nine-year-olds are really at 7-year-old levels."  </P> <P> Nashashibi deals with children in the 7- to 11-year age group, a period  regarded as important in terms of grasping concrete ideas and quantities and in  the absorption of social norms.  </P> <P> "It's possible that the children are learning a certain amount of independence  and assertiveness that can prove valuable," she said, "but they are not  learning limits, moral norms and values. There's a lot of aggressiveness. Who  will teach that freedom stops when it annoys others? How will the children  learn limits? Their behavior is becoming unpredictable."  </P> <P> A mother in Beit Sahur described how her son, who is 10, was refusing to go to  school until the Palestinians achieve their independence.  </P> <P> "I tell him," she said, "that he'll be of no use to our country if he does not  study. He answers that the work in the streets is more important.  </P> <P> "Imagine! He uses words like 'polarization' and 'collaborators.' What about  beauty and nature? What kind of childhood is this?"  </P> <P> Just then the son entered and listened to his mother's complaint.  </P> <P> "My mother gets mad sometimes," he said. "When we have a state, we will make  her defense minister. No one would dare attack us."  </P></p>

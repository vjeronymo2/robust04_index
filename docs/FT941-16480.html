			<p>940110 FT  10 JAN 94 / Leading Article: Next steps for the Tecs The establishment three years ago of the Training and Enterprise Councils was one of Britain's bolder institutional shifts of recent years, even if the task of running Tecs has been made more difficult by the government's ambivalence towards the market failure which called them into existence. Nonetheless, the Tecs have disappointed the cynics who said they would emulate Private Industry Councils in the US, which lost business support. Of the three tasks bestowed upon Tecs - organising the training of the unemployed, raising the skill level of the employed and stimulating enterprise - they have performed the first more efficiently than the state and have made some progress in the last two. Although of uneven quality, their industry committees have become useful forums for corporate networking and their compact size has made them ideal sites for experiments, such as those now taking place on job creation. Above all, the Tecs have tapped a large reservoir of regionally-based civic capitalism, which recognises that there is a collective interest in public economic goods such as an effective training system. If that enthusiasm is not to wither away, the Tecs cannot stand still. As spelt out in a book published today by Professor Robert Bennett and colleagues at the London School of Economics, Tecs have not become powerful agents of business self-administration, such as the German chambers of commerce, which many people - including Mr Michael Heseltine in late 1980's exile - wanted. Given Britain's individualistic business culture and the character of the government it was unrealistic to suppose that they would. The relevant question now is whether pushing them gradually in this direction will remedy the problems identified. Less impact In the field of stimulating economic development, and channelling public support for business, the answer is a qualified yes. Tecs have had less impact than hoped in this field partly because they have had very little money for it, but also because of their hybrid character and the fact that they overlap with other institutions such as local authorities, chambers of commerce, and various government agencies, including the trade department's latest offspring, the one-stop-shop. Merging chambers and Tecs, despite their different traditions, makes sense in terms of increasing the impact of both types of organisation and in creating local bodies that are big enough to provide most government business support services. Some form of compulsory registration for companies with more than 100 employees would also be worth considering. Independence The improved information about local companies that would come with registration could also improve the Tecs' contribution to in-company vocational training. But to make a real impact here Tecs need more financial and operational independence from government. That means either allowing them to levy funds from local businesses or to share in the business rate, or some mixture of the two. German success in vocational training has many causes, including a collective bargaining system which makes it difficult for employers to poach skilled workers, but the existence of well-funded chambers to administer the system, financed by local employers and a local tax, is one cause of that success. Britain cannot hope to copy German success by simply borrowing its institutions. But if Tecs are going to become more than sophisticated quangos for training the unemployed they need to acquire something akin to the strength and independence of German chambers. It is an open question whether bodies devoted to raising business quality in general, and in-company training in particular, should also have a monopoly in running large-scale training programmes for the unemployed. It is time for ministers to recognise that the process of granting greater autonomy to former public sector agencies across the economy needs to be applied to the Tecs. Targets would still need to be set and quality rigorously monitored by the Tecs' paymasters, but enabling Tecs and chambers to merge would be a useful step along the way.</p>

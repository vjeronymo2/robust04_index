			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / British Coal tells Welsh pit to double production British Coal yesterday intensified its drive for efficiency by announcing plans to close its mine service centre at Ashington, Northumberland, and demanding a doubling in production from a reduced workforce at its Tower colliery in Wales. The corporation said it would have to review its position at Tower if the targets were not met. Unions at the pit, previously considered one of the 19 core collieries, interpreted this as a threat to close it. The moves come ahead of the government's privatisation of the industry, with publication of a bill possible today. Unions in the north-east were told that British Coal wanted to close the Ashington centre next February following the rapid contraction of mining capacity throughout the country. Closure would mean the loss of 212 engineering jobs. Two service centres would remain: one in nearby Tursdale and the other in Bestwood, Nottinghamshire. The Ashington centre was opened in 1959 and specialises in servicing and repairing engineering equipment for the mining industry. A recent decision to close Wearmouth colliery has left just one deep mine in the north-east - at Ellington. That has reduced work for the Ashington centre, which repairs and refurbishes underground vehicles and tunnelling equipment. British Coal said falling demand for coal had also pushed workloads down at Ashington. At Tower, near Hirwaun, Mid Glamorgan, managers said they wanted 37 redundancies from the 240-strong workforce and a doubling of production to 11,000 tonnes a week by Christmas. British Coal said no bonus payments would be made unless the manpower and production target was met. It said it wanted Tower to succeed and it maintained that the pit had a future if it could perform at required levels. Mr Tyrone O'Sullivan, National Union of Mineworkers branch secretary, said no more men wanted to take redundancy because there were no other jobs in the area, an unemployment blackspot. Meanwhile, miners at Silverdale pit in Staffordshire were voting on whether to accept the colliery's planned closure and take redundancy payments of up to Pounds 44,000 each. A vote in favour of closure was expected.</p>

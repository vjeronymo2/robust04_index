			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / International Company News: Preussag rescues French metals division Preussag, the German engineering and metals group, is to prop up its ailing French subsidiary MetalEurop with a capital injection of between DM120m and DM150m (Dollars 71m-Dollars 88m). In spite of reassurances of a satisfactory group result for 1992-93 even after allowing for MetalEurop's losses, Preussag's share price dropped DM15.50 to DM451 in Frankfurt yesterday. The stock market setback was sharpened by rumours of a FFr400m (Dollars 67.8m) deficit at the French subsidiary and uncertainty generated by the crisis at Metallgesellschaft, which this week asked banks and shareholders to fund a bail-out package valued at DM3.2bn. Preussag offered no information on the extent of losses, although a statement from MetalEurop said they would be markedly higher than the previous year's FFr167m because of rapidly falling prices for lead and zinc, its main products. The business was FFr142m in the red for the first six months of last year. In return for the rescue, Preussag will take a 49 per cent stake in the subsidiary's die-casting and galvanisation businesses in Germany. The price of the stake will be fixed by independent auditors.</p>

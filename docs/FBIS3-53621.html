The talks are expected to begin tomorrow, Saturday, with the  North Korean delegation visiting Tehran headed by Air Force  Commander General Cho Myong-nok. The Iranian side in the talks  will be headed by Revolutionary Guard Commander General Mohsen  Reza'i.    Gen. Cho arrived in Tehran yesterday at the head of a  delegation of 28 scientists, technicians, and officers. This is  the first time in a decade that a North Korean high-level  military delegation officially visits a noncommunist state.    The issue of additional cooperation in the field of  ballistic  weapons will top the agenda. Iran had originally purchased  about 800 Soviet-type Scud missiles from North Korea but it is  now investing in the development of a new version of the Scud-C  missile known as Nodong-2 [number as published] with a range of  600 miles, according to Western experts. The new missile can  carry chemical and nuclear warheads and hit almost any Middle  Eastern capital.    The first version of that missile was scheduled to be tested  in Iran last September but the testing was postponed at the last  moment, probably because the two parties were worried about the  presence of U.S. spy satellites and AWACS planes in the region.    The strength of Iranian-North Korean relations could perhaps  be gauged on the basis of the number of visits exchanged between  the two countries. North Korea is the only country in the world  to have visited Iran's leader 'Ali Khamene'i and all his  important aides including President Hashemi-Rafsanjani.  [passage omitted]</p>

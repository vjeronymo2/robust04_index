			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Jaroslav Kmenta article: ``The Army Tested Small Pox''] </F>   [Text] Prague -- Although only a month ago army officials  kept quiet about the smallpox virus ever having been studied in  Czechoslovakia, the army admitted yesterday that military  scholars worked with this dangerous virus in the 1960's and  1970's. Moreover, according to the former employees of the  Military Health Institute, the smallpox virus has never been  destroyed.    There was no smallpox virus in the viral strain bank that  the  army liquidated last February, while, according to information  available, it was not destroyed in the 1980's either. So far,  none of the army or civilian officials we asked has explained  what has actually happened to the smallpox virus.    The director of the Central Military Health Institute,  Vladimir Radovnicky, believes that the virus was destroyed  between 1976 and 1978. ``The smallpox virus strain (variola  maior) was here once, because there is a diagnostic serum. It  was a problem of the 1970's. The strain was probably destroyed.  Nevertheless, I cannot give a definite answer of when and how  it was destroyed. I can only confirm that the smallpox virus  was not in the strain bank that was destroyed earlier this year.  It would be hard for me to trace what happened in the 1960's  and 1970's,'' he said. He then emphasized that there is no  viral strain, even less the smallpox one, in his institute now.    A former employee of the same institute, who wishes to  remain  anonymous, and who used to work with the smallpox viruses,  asserted that, after the smallpox research was concluded in the  1970's, the strain was frozen in liquid nitrogen and placed in a  special container.    In 1979, when thanks to the world-wide systematic  inoculation, smallpox was completely suppressed, the General  Commission for Elimination of Smallpox recommended that all  remaining stock of smallpox virus be either destroyed or  transferred to reference laboratories in the United States and  the USSR. ``We have not respected the research recommendation  by the world commission out of laziness, rather than out of bad  intentions,'' the former staffer of the research laboratory  admitted.</p>

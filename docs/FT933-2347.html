			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / As They Say in Europe: A surfeit of good news THE PAPERS faced a real problem this week. What could they say about an amazing event that, by the time it took place, had become a bit of an anti-climax? And after all it was hard to say anything that added to the news itself. For me the high point of the ceremonial signing of the Middle East peace agreement came with the sight of Mrs Al Gore tripping across the White House lawn on the arms of an airman, a scene surely stolen from that dreadful, long-forgotten Hollywood musical North Atlantic. Even though the superfluity of comment has never stopped a leader writer writing leaders, this week there was clear evidence of comment fatigue. The Germans showed it most clearly. On Monday the press review of the radio station, Deutsche Welle, opened with the words: 'The main theme in the editorials of the German papers today is the outcome of the election for the Mayor of Munich. In addition there is the long-running discussion over the successor to President von Weizsacker as well as the signing of partial autonomy agreement for the Palestinians of the Gaza Strip and Jericho.' The French, on the other hand, threw themselves into a frantic cliche competition. Walls of hate, a hundred years of bloodshed, salute the men of peace, 1989 all over again - it flowed in an endless stream. Eventually Liberation won the Purple Bore award by opening its commentary with the words, 'It has been said, it has to be repeated, the agreement signed in Washington resembles that of 15 years ago which put an end to the war between Israel and Egypt only in form and in its staging.' The headlines ranged from 'Peace sealed with a handshake' to 'An end to bloodshed.' Aftenposten of Oslo was able to write, for the first time quite legitimately, about 'Norway and the Middle East problem.' The Neue Zurcher Zeitung, with its usual cheap sensationalism, ran the headline, 'The Gaza-Jericho Agreement signed' right across two columns. This paper joined its peers elsewhere in solving the problem of what to write about when there is one big story and little else. You write about football. The NZZ examined the crisis in the Scottish game, which might seem odd until you remember that Scotland's attempt to enter the World Cup final rounds in the US next year seems to have collapsed. The Scots have been laid low by the ultimate ignominy - victims of Swiss sporting prowess. Not that the NZZ actually gloated, it just examined how the Scots felt and what would happen to the manager, Andy Roxburgh. (He resigned). The paper's counterpart in Paris, Le Monde, devoted its front page commentary to the corruption crisis surrounding Olympique Marseille and its banning from the European Cup following bribery allegations and the curious behaviour of the team's owner, the millionaire socialist Bernard Tapie. In a piece headed 'Planet Football,' Le Monde tried to assure its readers that events surrounding OM and the European authority, UEFA, were worthy of attention, for they were part of a wider European phenomenon. 'Having excluded from the competition in the last few weeks, one by one, clubs from Poland, Georgia and Latvia, UEFA is only spectacularly confirming its policy of intransigence in a period of transition that sees the burgeoning in Eastern Europe of young, inexperienced football federations.' In other words, UEFA is not playing its role in the European process. The last of the big three, the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung devoted its main editorial last weekend to the prosperity of the German league, the Bundesliga. 'Bad times are good for football. Thus many analysts see the boom in the Bundesliga. Things are not so bad in Germany, with recession and structural change, that everyday cares have stopped fans going in their droves to football matches.' Only in the old eastern states, said the paper, did football fail to flourish. So it emerges that football is a symbol of national political failure - 'The Bundesliga has again become what it was before unification - a purely west German quality sports product.' Thus these top papers confronted a familiar marketing problem - how to achieve product differentiation when the product is the result of external forces which are the same for everybody. Curiously El Pais in Spain failed to adopt the football solution. Regularly last week, on page seven, a full page contained a picture of the lower part of a male torso, fully clad. The caption read, 'His testicles will appear in El Pais.' Turn over to page nine and a photo of a clearly defined upper torso of a woman appears. Its caption is, 'Her breasts will appear in El Pais.' Page 11 was an advertisement for the 'El Pais Visual Encyclopaedia of Living Beings.' A Spanish colleague blamed this on the coarse Benetton ads featuring sick people and suchlike, but I think it was there to distract attention from all the good news.

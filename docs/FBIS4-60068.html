			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi </F> Beilin by Hayim Zissowitz; place not given -- live]    [Text] [Zissowitz] I understand you were surprised by  Ambassador Djerejian's resignation.    [Beilin] I admit I was very surprised, and up to this moment  I have not been officially informed about it. I understand from  the media that it is final, and if that is so, then it is very  problematic and very regrettable from our viewpoint due to his  short tenure and Djerejian's importance in the political process.    [Zissowitz] Did you not detect a short circuit between  Djerejian and his State Department bosses in Washington?    [Beilin] I do not think there was anything like that, anyway  I did not know about anything like that. According to the  report from Washington, it was not due to any internal problem,  but because he has received an outside offer he could not turn  down.    [Zissowitz] Djerejian was meant to have a central role in  the talks with the Syrians, and will be missed, if only due to  the fact that he was ambassador in Damascus and knew al-Asad.    [Beilin] That is true. He made a very important  contribution. We had a very interesting situation in which our  ambassador, Itamar Rabinovich, also heads the talks with Syria  and is an expert on Syria. The U.S. ambassador in Israel was  previously ambassador in Syria, and then assistant secretary for  Near Eastern affairs. The fact that the two played a role in  the political process was very, very important for the shuttle  diplomacy commenced by the secretary of state. That is why we  so much regret his apparent decision to resign.    [Zissowitz] Could it impair, spoil the negotiations with the  Syrians?    [Beilin] No, it cannot hamper the negotiations, but he made  a contribution, which will cease with his departure. It cannot  harm or deeply hinder the political process, which at the moment  depends to a certain extent on U.S. readiness to enhance its  efforts in the shuttle between the two sides in view of the  existing gaps and the positive basis existing between them.    [Zissowitz] How would you define the situation in the talks  with the Syrians?    [Beilin] I would say that the shared principle of peace and  territories is very firm, as never before, and it gives me hope  that we will have a peace accord within months and not years.  The separate positions appear to be very far apart, therefore  there is an optically distorted picture of gaps that cannot be  bridged. I believe the gaps can be bridged, and I think it is  the U.S. Administration that can bridge those gaps, because at  the moment, I do not see a better channel for talks between us  and them, especially since the Syrians are still unprepared for  talks between the two sides on a senior political level.  Therefore, in addition to the resumption of the bilateral talks  in Washington, U.S. shuttle diplomacy will have a role in  closing the gaps. That is why I am optimistic, and anything  that harms the chance to succeed in that diplomacy, such as  Djerejian's announcement, is regrettable.    [Zissowitz] Djerejian served as ambassador here only a short  time. Would you call him a friend of Israel?    [Beilin] I do not know if we can use that expression....    [Zissowitz, interrupting] We usually like to stick those  titles on people.    [Beilin] I have my own formula. I say that whoever is a  friend of peace is a friend of Israel, and Djerejian definitely  was a friend of peace. I also think that he can be seen as a  personal friend of many among us. The man was very informed. I  met him almost 10 years ago when he began his post as head of  the Israel desk in the State Department, and then in other  posts, including ambassador in Syria, and assistant secretary  for Near Eastern affairs, and in all those roles he made an  important contribution to the political process. In his  previous position, he headed their team in the multilateral  talks, and together we advanced those talks beyond their poor  start and made them into something much more significant. He is  one of the most knowledgeable people on the Middle East in the  State Department, and there are not many others like him. That  is why his move is a blow to us. In order to find somebody to  replace Djerejian as ambassador in Israel they will have to  search far and wide in the State Department for somebody with  his level of expertise, knowledge, and familiarity.    [Zissowitz] Will Israel ask that the appointment be made as  soon as possible?    [Beilin] I assume that is a top American interest. We will  not intervene in the selection of the person or the timing, but  it is obvious that in the very intensive relations between us  and the Americans, neither of us can permit long interruptions.</p>

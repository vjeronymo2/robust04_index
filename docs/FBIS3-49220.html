			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Stanislav Stoilov, "economic expert" of the </F> Russian Liberal Democratic Party, headed by Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy, by Valeriya Veleva at Sofia Airport; date not  given: "I Shall Be President of the Balkans, and We Will Throw  the Parties Into the Sea"]    [Text] A few minutes before taking off for Vienna,  accompanied by the second man in command of Zhirinovskiy's  party, Stanislav Stoilov, the businessman from the town of  Sandanski, explained his plans for the near future related to  his political activities in the Balkan peninsula. We are  publishing the following interview without any editorial  intervention.    [Veleva] Mr. Stoilov, while vacationing at the "Sandanski"  Hotel, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy managed to pay a brief visit to  Salonika. What kind of business took you to the shores of the  Aegean Sea?    [Stoilov] We visited Salonika without a visa and without  passports. There were approximately 10 of us, including the  bodyguards, and they let us cross the border. We went there for  negotiations with the government of certain people with whom we  had arranged meetings in advance. [sentence as published] The  Salonika police accompanied us at all times with their lights  on, while, here in this country, we were met by Turkish bandits  who were demonstrating against us.    [Veleva] Do you really intend to become Bulgarian president,  as Mr. Zhirinovskiy designated you?    [Stoilov] Me, Bulgarian president?! This would be an insult  for me. I shall become president of the Balkans (the Balkan  peninsula -- TRUD editorial note). This will be followed by a  great upheaval in Bulgaria. We shall throw all the parties that  exist in the country today into the Black Sea. The plan is  ready. There will be an upheaval of all parties that were  guilty for Bulgaria's disintegration from 1944 until their  capitulation. All those who have committed murders, who have  sent people to concentration camps, who have interned them  (mispronounces the word -- TRUD editorial note), who have  altered streets and cities, who are guilty of laundering  [waschen -- in German] -- all those people should be put on  trial! All of them!    [Veleva] How do you plan to become president of all the  Balkan states?    [Stoilov] Yes, I shall become president of all Balkans! You  will hear about it. The plan is ready.    [Veleva] Who is going to help you?    [Stoilov] I shall do it all by myself! We do not need  anyone's assistance. We have the strength. This is our  problem. You will see.    [Veleva] When is this supposed to happen?    [Stoilov] Very soon. Macedonia's liberation, the annexation  of Thracia, the seizing of Dobrudzha. All of these will become  one state. Tsar Boris II, a Bulgarian who lives...in Madrid,  remains the leader of all this.    [Veleva] I have never heard of such a king living in Madrid.    [Stoilov] There is a king...the son of King Boris. (He  totally confuses the names -- TRUD editorial note) Well, it is  actually King Simeon II. He shall be the king of Bulgaria as  usual.    [Veleva] Will he be subordinate to you?    [Stoilov] No, he shall rule Bulgaria, while I rule the  Balkans.    [Veleva] Does it mean that Bulgaria will become a monarchy  subject under a large territory ruled by a president?    [Stoilov] Yes! Bulgaria was founded 1,300 years ago by  kings, and many kings have sacrificed their lives for Bulgaria,  and Bulgaria, created by kings, shall be a Bulgarian kingdom.  Numerous parties exist in Bulgaria today, but he (the king --  TRUD editorial note) will come. I will take care of Macedonia  and other states -- I mean territories that belong to Bulgaria  but were taken from us. I will help to annex Dobrudzha and parts  of other states that were taken.... Edirne, for example, as long  as it has something to do with Yugoslavia and Macedonia.  [sentence as published] How exactly the Balkans will be ruled  with Bulgaria remains to be clarified in a personal talk with  King Simeon II, who lives in Spain. We shall hold a conference  with him. I contacted his secretary -- she speaks Bulgarian --  and after the New Year, I mean after the holidays, we shall hold  such a meeting.    [Veleva] How is the Bulgarian republic expected to turn into  a kingdom?    [Stoilov] This is.... It is related to a plan that we must  await. It is a long-term plan, very long-term, indeed. There  are many things we cannot tell you in advance because you are a  journalist. If you were a politician, and if we were sitting in  a room behind closed doors, and if you belonged to our party, we  might reveal the whole plan to you. However, it is our own  plan. We shall never leave the Balkans and the Bulgarians under  different commands, with territories robbed from all parts.  Bulgaria and Macedonia together shall be a great state.    [Veleva] Are those plans of yours likely to provoke a  military conflict in the Balkans?    [Stoilov] We are so strong that no one would dare to do  anything. In saying "we," I mean our party -- Mr.  Zhirinovskiy's party!    [Veleva] How did he react to his expulsion from Bulgaria?    [Stoilov] He was not expelled from Bulgaria. They know that  he is dangerous, for Bulgaria as well; hence, they have no right  to expel him. He is my personal friend. I asked him to stay  another five days, but he has his own program. They (the  authorities -- TRUD editorial note) could never expel him. I  have an Austrian passport and a Bulgarian passport. Me, being a  citizen of Bulgaria, he can stay with me for another 100 years.  This so-called provision that he must be expelled from Bulgaria  is part of the propaganda spread by the other parties.    [Veleva] Did you meet Todor Zhivkov?    [Stoilov] No, but we would like to meet him. He is nicer  than Zhelyu Zhelev. There was discipline under him, and he is  not guilty. He was ruled by Moscow.    [Veleva] I know that it is not a very decent question, but  are you a rich man?    [Stoilov] I have worked hard and I am a rich man, as a  matter of fact. I have several millions, but I am not a  billionaire. However, I do have a lot of money. I have  purchased automobiles and apartments for my sisters, as well as  my sisters' children. My house in Sveti Vrach, called Sandanski  today, which was confiscated in the past, is being totally  rebuilt. I am also building a house with four floors in the  Pirin mountain, at a height of 1,300 meters. I usually visit  Bulgaria once or twice a month, but we are starting on a world  tour now. We have very important tasks.    [Veleva] Was Mr. Zhirinovskiy very offended when he left  Bulgaria?    [Stoilov] He was very offended by Mr. Zhelev's policy  because they [the Russians] have liberated Bulgaria from the  Turkish yoke, which lasted 500 years, and no matter which party  he belongs to, he is a Soviet man, after all.    (In the meantime, Mr. Venedikov, who is the second man in  command of Zhirinovskiy's party and future defense  minister-designate, joined the conversation and stated as  follows -- TRUD editorial note)    [Venedikov] As soon as we take over the power in Russia, the  fate of the whole world shall be predetermined. Everything will  fall into place, as it is correct and appropriate for the  peoples of all countries.</p>

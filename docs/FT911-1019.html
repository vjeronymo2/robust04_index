			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / US banking legislation clears initial hurdle LEGISLATION to strengthen the US banking system cleared its first congressional hurdle yesterday, although Mr Paul Volcker, former chairman of the Federal Reserve, warned that provisions to remove protection from all depositors in large banks could trigger a crisis. The financial institutions sub-committee of the House banking committee approved a bill providing for the recapitalisation of the financially strained bank insurance fund, by raising the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's (FDIC) line of credit at the Treasury from the current Dollars 5bn to Dollars 30bn (Pounds 17.6bn). The bill would bar the FDIC from protecting deposits above the insurance guarantee limit of Dollars 100,000. In the past the corporation has protected such uninsured depositors under the 'too big to fail' doctrine, because of fears that losses to any depositors in failed large banks could trigger a loss of confidence across the system. The Treasury and the Federal Reserve favour retaining an element of discretion under more restrictive conditions than now. Yesterday Mr Volcker told the Senate banking committee that 'removal from the FDIC of its ability to protect all depositors of large failed banks could well trigger a crisis in the banking system of a magnitude entirely capable of turning a serious recession into something much worse, precipitating escalating losses and larger budget deficits through the economy.' He also warned that, 'unhappy as the situation may be, substantial public funds will be required to bolster the resources available to the FDIC'. Under the plan approved by the sub-committee, any additional FDIC borrowing will be repaid by the banking industry itself through increased premiums paid to the insurance fund. The Treasury has welcomed the sub-committee's action to recapitalise the bank insurance fund, although it will be seeking to amend the removal of the 'too big to fail' discretion. The sub-committee will start considering next week the Bush administration's broader plan to allow banks to operate national branch systems and to link with securities and other financial service companies. It is still unclear how many of these proposals will be approved and the full House banking committee will decide at the end of June whether to go ahead with comprehensive banking reform, as sought by President George Bush, or just the version agreed this week. The Federal Reserve secured two important victories in the sub-committee version. First, the administration had originally suggested the FDIC should borrow from the Fed rather than the Treasury, and the Fed's objections were reflected in the acceptance of Treasury borrowing. Second, the sub-committee voted 22 to 13 to remove a provision that would have restricted the central bank's ability to help poorly capitalised banks with loans through the discount window to head off disruptions to banking and financial systems.</p>

"We have identified 10 countries categorized as big emerging  markets, and we are going to come forward with a specific export  strategy for all of those countries," Brown said.    Speaking at a press conference attended by foreign  reporters,  the secretary stressed that the country's specific strategies  are "very focused" and "very targeted."    The secretary said that in doing so, the U.S. "doesn't mean  the exclusion of any that aren't on that list of ten. It just  means that we're going to be giving some special attention" to  them.    He disclosed that his department has completed the work of  planning export strategies to two of the 10 countries. India,  Poland, Indonesia and Turkey are on the list, and Russia is not,  he said, adding that there are no countries from the Middle East.    "I agree that too little attention has been given to India  as  a market. I intend to end that era of neglect and to give India  significant attention in that regard," Brown said.    The secretary explained that the new list is an important  part of the national export strategy put forward by the Clinton  Administration late last year.    The criteria for emerging markets, Brown said, include  economic strength, population size, opportunity for American  exports, the market-drive nature of the economy, economic reform  and privatization.    The government's policy towards investment and the  protection  of intellectual property rights are also important criteria, the  secretary said.</p>

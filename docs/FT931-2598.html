			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / International Company News: Hutchison Whampoa declines 5% - Hong Kong Results HUTCHISON Whampoa, the troubled Hong Kong conglomerate controlled by Mr Li Ka-shing, yesterday posted a 5 per cent fall in profits before extraordinaries to HKDollars 3.16bn (USDollars 410m) for 1992, from HKDollars 3.32bn the year before. The slightly better-than-expected results were struck on a 9.5 per cent rise in turnover to HKDollars 21bn from HKDollars 19.2bn. Profits after extraordinary items, meanwhile, fell to HKDollars 3bn from HKDollars 4.3bn. An extraordinary loss arose from the closure of certain 'peripheral overseas telecommunications operations' and a provision against an associated company. Hutchison declared a final dividend of 39 cents a share, making 55 cents for the year - a 19 per cent cut on the payout in 1991. Mr Simon Murray, managing director, said 1993 would prove a turning point in Hutchison's fortunes. 'I think we will do very well in 1993; it is going to be a good year.' Mr Murray scotched rumours that he was about to resign from the company. The rumours had made 'good gossip', he said, but were far from the truth. 'I am here, and Mr Li has not given me any indication that he wants me to go.' Separately, Mr Li said yesterday he and Mr Murray were 'still working happily' together. Mr Murray said that if provisions against Hutchison's investment in Husky, a Canadian oil and gas producer, were added back, profits before extraordinaries would have been HKDollars 4.6bn, 15 per cent higher than in 1991. He predicted that Husky, in which Hutchison holds 49 per cent, would earn profits in 1993. In the year under review, it incurred a modest loss but, he noted, was generating free cash-flows of CDollars 200m (USDollars 161m). On Hutchison's telecommunications investments, Mr Murray said its 64 per cent owned UK company had made a loss and would incur a larger loss in 1993. It is launching a mobile telephone network in the UK and has invested Pounds 300m (USDollars 435m) of a planned Pounds 800m in the venture. British Aerospace holds 30 per cent and Barclays Bank 5 per cent in the company. Mr Murray stuck to his view that the UK venture would show excellent profits by 1995. Many analysts believe Hutchison has taken a big risk with the business, saying it has large costs and unproven technology. Mr Li emphasised Hutchison's efforts to invest in mainland China during 1992. Direct foreign investment in China had become easier and more attractive, he said. Hongkong International Terminals, Hutchison's container port operator, had signed joint venture agreements with the authorities in Zhuhai and Shanghai to develop port facilities. He said Hutchison was focusing on developing retailing and manufacturing in selected cities in China. It was also pursuing property development projects in Guangzhou, Shanghai and Qingdao.</p>

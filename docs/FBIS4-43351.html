			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article from Brussels EUROPE: "King Hassan </F> Hosts EU'S Van den Broek"]    [Text] King Hassan II of Morocco has received European  Commissioner for External Relations Hans Van den Broek. The  prospect of a new EU/Morocco agreement and the role of Morocco  in the Mediterranean region were discussed. Mr. van den Broek  said at the close of the meeting that Morocco was a pole of  stability and a peace factor in his region. Regarding the  agreement envisaged, he said that, for some aspects, there was  already a broad basis of consensus, but that others seemed to be  more difficult. EUROPE recalls that Morocco has submitted  counter-proposals to the content of the new agreement, and that,  before the opening of official negotiations, preparatory  discussions are to be continued.</p>

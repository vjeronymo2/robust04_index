			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 22 KYODO -- Japan on Sunday [22 May]  became a party to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of  the Child.    The Foreign Ministry sent ratification documents to the  world  body last month and Japan's participation in the convention came  into force on Sunday.    The convention, which came into force in September 1990,  addresses the individual rights of children and sets universally  accepted standards for their protection.    Japan is the 158th country to join the child protection  treaty.    Some Japanese have criticized the government for defending a  part of the country's civil code which they say violates the  convention by discriminating against and stigmatizing  illegitimate children.    Under the code an illegitimate child's inheritance is set at  half that of a legitimate child.    Also, legitimate children in the family registration system  are listed in such manner as "eldest son" or "youngest  daughter," while illegitimate children are listed only as "male"  or "female."</p>

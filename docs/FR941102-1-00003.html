			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On January 7, 1994, the Executive Director for Operations (EDO) sent to the Commission SECY&hyph;94&hyph;003, ``Plan for Implementing Regulatory Review Group Recommendations.'' The Commission approved these recommendations for reducing regulatory burden on its licensees. This proposed rule is one of several rulemaking and other regulatory actions that the NRC staff is developing to implement those recommendations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> During the NRC staff review of the regulations,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notices were published on February 24, 1992 (57 FR 6299) and June 19, 1992 (57 FR 27394) that solicited the views of the public, the nuclear power industry, and other interested parties regarding reduction of the regulatory burden and reporting requirements. Comments were received in response to those notices. A summary of the comments received that are pertinent to this action is included in this document. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Discussion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> These proposed amendments would: (1) Eliminate the current requirement for licensees to submit summary reports of containment leakage rate tests to the NRC (10 CFR Part 50&hyph;Appendix J), but preserve the requirements in &sect;&sect;50.72 and 50.73 under which licensees currently report any instances of leakage exceeding authorized limits in the technical specifications of the license; (2) revise 10 CFR 55.25 to refer licensees to a similar reporting requirement in 10 CFR 50.74(c) and require notification of operator incapacity only in case of permanent disability or illness; and (3) eliminate the requirement for quarterly submittal of safeguards event logs presently contained in 10 CFR 73.71(c)(2) and Appendix G to Part 73. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although these proposed reduction in reporting requirements were discussed in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notices published on February 24, 1992 (57 FR 6299) and June 19, 1992 (57 FR 27394), the public is again invited to submit comments. Specifically, the NRC requests comments and supporting rationale on the appropriateness of eliminating or consolidating these reporting requirements and whether the public health and safety will be adversely affected by these changes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Elimination of Reporting Requirements from 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix J <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix J, currently requires all water-cooled nuclear power reactor licensees to conduct containment leakage testing. The containment leakage tests demonstrate that the containment system meets all the leakage criteria specified in the technical specifications of the licenses. Currently, Section V.B. of Appendix J requires licensees to submit a summary report of the results of all leak rate tests and any associated corrective actions. Under this proposed rulemaking, licensees of water-cooled nuclear power reactors will continue to conduct containment leakage testing and to prepare the summary report. However, they would not be required to submit the summary report to the NRC. They would still be required to report to the NRC instances of leakage in excess of authorized limits, via a written licensee event report, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  as now required by &sect;50.73(a)(2)(ii). If such a leakage condition is found during operation, an immediate notification by telephone is required by &sect;50.72(b)(1)(ii). If the leakage condition is found during shutdown the telephone notification is required by &sect;50.72(b)(2)(i). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> These reports would be required when total containment as-found, minimum pathway leak rate exceeds the limiting condition for operation (LCO) in the facility's technical specification. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NRC believes that the elimination of the requirement to submit the summary report to the NRC of leakage tests when these results are within acceptance limits would have no impact on the overall health and safety of the public. Because these tests have been performed and evaluated frequently by the nuclear power industry, any misinterpretation of testing requirements is highly unlikely. Moreover, licensees would still be required to prepare the summary reports and make those reports available for review and inspection at the respective plant sites. Having these reports available at the plant sites should be sufficient for normal record reviews, and for any necessary in-depth reviews. Therefore, the NRC proposes to eliminate the requirement to report results of tests within specified limits. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Consolidation of 10 CFR 50.74 and 10 CFR 55.25 Reporting Requirements <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If an operator licensed pursuant to 10 CFR 55, becomes ill or disabled to the point that he or she no longer can safely perform their duties, the reactor licensee is required to report the occurrence of disability under both 10 CFR 50.74(c) and 10 CFR 55.25. The NRC is proposing to require only a single report by eliminating the reporting requirements in 10 CFR 55.25 and modifying 10 CFR 55.25 to refer facility licensees to 10 CFR 50.74(c). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, when 10 CFR Part 55 was promulgated, the intent of &sect;55.25 was to receive reports only of permanent or potentially permanent illness or disability of licensed operators that would prevent them from safely carrying out their responsibilities. However, this intent, is not explicitly stated in either &sect;55.25 or &sect;50.74(c). To remove this ambiguity, the word ``permanent'' is added in both &sect;&sect;50.74(c) and 55.25. (A more detailed discussion on ``permanent'' versus ``temporary,'' illness, or disability can be found in the NRC publication NUREG&hyph;1262, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  ``Answers to Questions at Public Meetings Regarding Implementation of Title 10, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 55 on Operators' Licenses,'' November 1987, page 21, question 91). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Copies of NUREG&hyph;1262 may be purchased from the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Mail Stop SSOP, Washington, DC 20402&hyph;9328. Copies are also available from the National Technical Information Service, 5285 Port Royal Road, Springfield, VA 22161. A copy is also available for inspection and copying for a fee in the NRC Public Document Room, 2120 L Street, NW.

Neither suggested elimination of any power reactor reporting requirement. However, both suggested that the redundant requirements of 10 CFR Parts 50 and 55 addressing illness or disability of licensed operator be consolidated in 10 CFR 50.74. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

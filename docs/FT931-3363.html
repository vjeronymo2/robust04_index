			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (12): Vested interests in the aid trade BRITISH AID AND INTERNATIONAL TRADE by Oliver Morrissey, Brian Smith and Edward Horesh Open University Press Pounds 40, 184 pages THE THATCHER years were not particularly happy ones for British aid policy. They began with a sharp cut in the aid budget and ended amid controversy over the use of aid to back exports. One of the central arguments of this book is that British aid during this period achieved little either to help the poor in developing countries or even to increase exports. There was a lot of rhetoric about the commercial value of aid, but some of the more controversial developments, such as the establishment of the Aid and Trade Provision, helped only a few exporters with strong links to the government. Otherwise it was simply a distraction from the low real levels of aid spending. Whether or not one agrees with this conclusion, this book serves a useful purpose. The formulation of aid policy is not something which grabs much popular imagination even though it is of great importance to Britain's international relation ships. Despite the cuts aid still involved public spending in excess of Pounds 1.5bn in 1989. Policy-making thus needs to be transparent and those responsible for it accountable. In practice, as the authors point out, aid policy is the outcome of private lobbying between the various departments concerned: the Overseas Development Administration, Department of Trade and Industry, Foreign Office and the Treasury. Outside influences on them might largely be described as vested interests. Business is concerned with winning orders. The development lobby, consisting mainly of academics and voluntary organisations, is suspicious of anything which does not directly aim to improve the lot of the very poor. Without books like this one, there would be even less accountability in aid policy. The authors provide some useful explanations of how the policy process works. It usefully chivvies the ODA about the secretiveness of its finances. Its conclusion - that tied aid is not necessarily export-promoting  -is doubtless valid, even if it is predictable from a set of authors who identify most strongly with the the development lobby. The weakness lies more in their tendency to ignore what British aid did achieve in the 1980s. They note the influence that individual ministers have had on development thinking: Mr Christopher Patten on the connection to environment policy, for example, or Baroness Chalker on the role of women, but there is a reluctance to discuss some other important features of aid policy during the period. Thus Britain's support for structural adjustment programmes led by the World Bank and the reputation, endorsed by the OECD, for quality in its aid spending do not receive the attention they deserve. Perhaps the authors are so strongly committed to the development school that they are innately suspicious of the World Bank. If so they may be under-estimating the effectiveness of the aid programme's overall contribution to development. That is a pity. For unless aid can be seen to achieve something there is little point in increasing the budget. One thing on which almost all interested parties, except normally the Treasury, agree is that Britain spends too little on aid. This book gives a Chancellor intent on finding any possible way of saving money every incentive to cut the aid budget further.</p>

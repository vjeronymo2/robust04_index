			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / People: MacDonald to head CWS funeral services Alexander MacDonald has been made general manager of the Co-operative Wholesale Society funeral services group which, with a Pounds 60m annual turnover, now claims to be the largest wholly-owned UK funeral director. Some 640,000 funerals take place each year in the UK, 55,000 of them conducted by the CWS funeral services group. MacDonald, 50, had been acting general manager of the group since May, having moved from being the group's operations manager for Scotland and Northern Ireland. MacDonald joined the CWS funeral services group 10 years ago on secondment from the Industrial Society, the charitable status organisation which serves to provide managerial expertise and advice to its membership. Before joining CWS, MacDonald had a variety of management stints with companies including Distillers, Courtaulds and Cape Industries. The CWS funeral services group is based in Glasgow, which MacDonald says reflects the historical development of the co-operative society funeral business. Even today, 40 per cent of the Scottish funeral business is cornered by co-operative societies - including the CWS - compared with 25 per cent in the rest of the UK. There are 59 co-operative societies in the UK today, 25 of which operate their own funeral businesses, independent from that of the CWS. MacDonald says that it is not really a macabre business but is one of the more important service industries: 'You are providing a service to families at a time of considerable emotional stress, and it's only through the quality of that service that the business thrives.'</p>

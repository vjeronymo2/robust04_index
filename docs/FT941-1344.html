			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / Gerstner outlines strategy for IBM: Product line to be recast from 'top to bottom' with focus on client/server computing Mr Lou Gerstner, chairman of International Business Machines, yesterday outlined six 'strategic imperatives' to revive the fortunes of the ailing US computer company. In the first public discussion of his strategy since joining IBM 12 months ago, Mr Gerstner made clear that mainframe computers will no longer be the primary focus. IBM's product line would be recast from 'top to bottom'. Although IBM is developing a new generation of mainframes based on microprocessor technology, it will increasingly focus on client/server computing, based on networks of computers. 'The failure to capitalise on this seachange in our industry (from centralised 'host' mainframe computer systems to distributed networks) is the single most important mistake IBM has made in the last decade,' said Mr Gerstner. 'We have to take all we know about powerful host-based systems and create new . . . products for the open, distributed world. We should have done it a decade ago . . . I'm not trying to create a complete IBM make-over, a brand new IBM, but rather a sense of urgency, direction and engagement,' he added. Mr Gerstner also outlined five other 'strategic imperatives' for IBM: Exploiting the company's technology: In the past, IBM has invented new technologies, but failed to bring them to market as fast as its competitors, Mr Gerstner acknowledged. IBM will also license its technologies more broadly. The company's royalty income has nearly doubled over the past two years to almost Dollars 500m. Networking: IBM aims to establish itself as a leader in 'information super-highways'. Realigning sales and distribution: IBM is transforming its salesforce into groups of 'highly segmented and focused product specialists', while creating groups that provide services ranging from business re-engineering consulting to systems integration. to particular industry sectors. Geographic expansion: IBM will expand operations in emerging markets such as China and South America. Making size an advantage: in contrast to his predecessor, Mr John Akers, who planned to break up IBM into 'auto-nomous business units,' Mr Gerstner aims to 'leverage our economies of scale across research, development, manufacturing, distribution and services'. Mr Gerstner is encouraging the use, for example, of common technologies and components across different product lines and spoke of centralised purchasing as another way to cut costs. 'If our strategies fail,' said Mr Gerstner, 'it will be because we got in our own way.' Digital plans, Page 29</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by NARODNA ARMIYA special correspondent </F> Lieutenant-Colonel Nykyfor Lysytsya under the rubric "A  Journalist Covering a Problem": "The Aircraft Are Out of Order,  But the Aircraft Repair Enterprises Stand Idle"]    [Text] A report appeared in the press not very long ago  that just half of the aviation hardware of the Air Forces of  Ukraine is in a combat-capable state. I will not take it upon  myself to refute that information, I would only point out that  there are aircraft and helicopters that are not combat-ready or  have limited readiness in the 14th Air Army. Moreover, most of  them are the rotary-winged craft from army aviation that were  until recently under the subordination of the PrykVO [Carpathian  Military District]. One of my features already talked about the  17 Mi-26 helicopters that are standing idle without main rotors  (NA of 29 December 1993).    Whatever the quantity of faulty aviation hardware, however,  it must evoke anxiety among all of the officials connected with  it. The more so as it will increase with every day if the  appropriate measures are not taken. The paradox consists of the  fact that there are getting to be more and more faulty aircraft,  while the operation of the aircraft repair enterprises is  slowing down or even coming to a halt. It is also worth noting  that there are more than fifteen aircraft-repair plants (ARZs)  in Ukraine. They are not only capable of repairing all of the  disabled aircraft and helicopters, but also of filling orders  for the repair of aviation hardware from other states, which  would provide quite a bit of currency receipts for the state  coffers. But...    I will show how matters look using the example of the  aircraft repair plant in Lviv. That collective has been headed  for quite a long time now by Colonel Vyacheslav Kupch. He came  to that enterprise as a lieutenant to the assembly shop, so he  knows the business he is engaged in very well. And this allows  him even during these difficult times to keep the "ship" afloat,  so to speak, which is quite difficult.    The Lviv ARZ has specialized in the repair of MiG aircraft  since its very creation. It has a good technical base, skilled  specialists and solid ties with other enterprises for the  performance of all repair operations. So they have everything  for the performance of their appointed duties. They even  recently mastered the repair of the most modern MiG-29 fighter.  And that was at their own expense. (The state, through the  Ministry of Defense, did not allocate a single karbovanets to  them for it).    The enterprise, moreover, started to repair that type of  aircraft last year, and has returned six MiG aircraft to their  units.    But even greater difficulties have appeared. The first is  finances, since the Ministry of Defense has not paid for any of  the aircraft. It turned out that the plant workers themselves  suffered from their own initiative in mastering repair of the  MiG-29...    The difficult situation has also affected the aircraft  repair  plant in Lutsk, which specializes in the repair of jet engines  for aircraft. Here, also at their own initiative and at their  own expense, they mastered the repair of the RD-33 engines that  are used on the MiG-29. They have repaired several of the units.  But they have not been paid a single karbovanets for it. The  work has thus been halted at the plant since December of last  year. The workers have been sent on "vacation." Many of them  have already found new jobs, and certainly will not return to  the enterprise. The costly equipment is standing idle. The  plant, in short, is collapsing.    The Ministry of Defense, of course, is not failing to settle  up with the repair plants out of some whim or ambition. It  simply has no money. There is not even enough money, as is well  known, to pay the servicemen.    I remind you of the popular saying of penny wise, pound  foolish. And when someone hits upon the idea of "economizing"  through the payments to the repair enterprises, then we will  have to pay not twice as much, but tens of times more. And as  early as today. If the ARZ stops working, the aircraft have to  be sent to Russia for repairs, and that requires hard currency.    Budgetary financing, of course, is the main source for the  enterprises of the Ministry of Defense, but it is far from the  only one. They could also find their own, quite significant  sources, and that without considerable efforts. Here are a few.    The author of these lines has already had occasion to write  about 164 aircraft that have been repaired and are being  preserved at the ARZ in Lviv. These are aircraft that are not  needed in practice to arm the Air Forces of Ukraine. But other  countries could acquire them for their armies. So why not sell  that surplus aviation hardware while it can still find buyers,  and organize the repair of our own aircraft using the funds  received?    This question sounds almost rhetorical, since it has already  been asked at various levels more than once. But weeks, months  and even years are passing, and no one will make the decision.  The aircraft are thus standing idle, growing functionally and  physically obsolete, to the benefit of no one. The plant, on the  contrary, suffered losses of some 726 million karbovantsy for  the upkeep of the aforementioned 164 aircraft last year; the  total will be considerably higher this year.    Quite a few repaired engines have accumulated at the ARZ in  Lutsk that are also not needed by the Air Forces of Ukraine, and  in such quantity that they exceed a five-year supply. They could  also be sold. A significant portion of the assemblies that are  removed from aircraft destroyed in accordance with international  agreements could also be offered for sale. Quite a bit that  could be sold abroad, getting profits where there are losses  today, could certainly be found at other ARZs as well.    But unfortunately no one is occupied with this. Rather,  there  is no one to be occupied with it, since the aircraft repair  plants do not have the right or the capability, while the the  corresponding structure has not been created in the directorate  of the Air Forces.    There is yet another way to obtain funds--to perform repairs  on the aviation hardware of other states. The Lviv ARZ repaired  several aircraft for Poland last year, and was paid in hard  currency for it. Those funds, by the way, were spent to master  the repair of the MiG-29 and maintain the operability of the  enterprise.    The plant will have the opportunity to repair aircraft that  are in service with the armies of Western Europe, India and some  others in the future as well. But concluding agreements  independently at the international level is outside the scope of  authority of Colonel Kupch and his subordinates. A coordinating  body in the Air Forces directorate is required here once again.  It is also required in order to plan and analyze the work of the  ARZs and place state orders. Its absence led to the fact that  some enterprises last year were engaged in the repair of  aviation hardware that is not in service in Ukraine.    A situation has moreover taken shape today where there is  not  a single order for the targets of the ARZs that would stipulate  the product range and volume of repairs of aviation hardware.  This means that there is no legal basis for payment for the  output for military purposes that would be produced by the  enterprises.    There are many other problems as well, connected with the  fact that no one wants or is able to coordinate the affairs of  the ARZs. They are left, so to speak, to the whims of fate,  under the slogan of "every man for himself." So it ends up that  Lutsk and some other plants have shut down, while Lviv, in order  to survive, is engaged in the production of kitchen furnishings,  medical instruments and even the assembly of intercity buses.  That is possibly necessary, but the main thing for them is the  repair of aircraft for the Air Forces of Ukraine. And they are  not letting the plant pursue that business. So it turns out that  almost half of the aircraft are out of order, but the aircraft  repair plants are standing idle.</p>

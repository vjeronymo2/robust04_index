			<p><P> February 6, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY COLLEGE NOTEBOOK: FOR WILKERSON, THIS VICTORY BIGGEST  </P> <P> Rick Wilkerson, Grossmont Community College's men's basketball coach, called  Saturday's 81-77 victory over Imperial Valley the Griffins' biggest in the  regular season in his nine years at the El Cajon school.  </P> <P> Imperial Valley, the home team, had been unbeaten and ranked No. 1 in  California.  </P> <P> "I've had a couple of outstanding teams here, one that was 28-4 and another  24-6," Wilkerson said, "but I don't know that I've ever beaten a No. 1  undefeated team before. That was pretty big.  </P> <P> "I think their crowd (2,000-plus in standing room only) always brings out the  best in us. They have big crowds, and it's an exciting atmosphere down there."  </P> <P> The Arabs, which fell to 27-1, 8-1 in the Pacific Coast Conference, had been  ranked No. 1 in the state for four weeks. Grossmont improved to 17-12, 7-2.  </P> <P> Grossmont never trailed, led by as many as 17 and survived two late runs by  Imperial Valley. Tony James had 20 points and nine rebounds, Brian Sims 11  points and 15 rebounds and Rafid Kiti 11 points and seven rebounds.  </P> <P> Kiti is playing this year after missing the last part of last season at  Valhalla with a punctured lung.  </P> <P> "That has healed totally," Wilkerson said. "It was a problem at birth where he  had a hole in his lung. (Surgeons) went in there and actually sewed it up. It  is not a problem now."  </P> <P> Imperial Valley's Keith Balzer, the leading scorer in the PCC, had 27 points.  The Arabs, however, were without their second leading scorer, Phil Clark, who  had flown to Georgia for his mother's funeral.  </P> <P> A former U.S. International University women's golfer was voted the European  Ladies Professional Golfer's Assn. rookie of the year for the second  consecutive year.  </P> <P> Helen Alfredsson, of Gothenburg, Sweden, won the award for the 1989 season.  Laurette Maritz, of Johannesburg, South Africa, won in '88.  </P> <P> Alfredsson was a second-team All-American in 1987, her junior year at USIU.  Maritz is the only women's golfer in NCAA history to earn first-team  All-American honors four times. She was also the 1987 NCAA player of the year  as voted on by the National Golf Coaches Assn.  </P> <P> San Diego State's baseball team has had just six no-hitters in its 52 years. On  Friday, Rick Navarro had one going before being relieved in the seventh inning  of a 11-4 victory over The Master's College Friday.  </P> <P> SDSU was leading, 11-0, at the time, but Coach Jim Dietz said it was too early  in the season for him to go the distance.  </P> <P> Navarro, a graduate of Helix High, pitched a no-hitter against Grossmont High  his senior season during which he finished the year 14-0 with a 1.21 earned run  average.  </P> <P> He was 1-0 with two saves and a 2.12 earned run average as a freshman in 1989  meaning he has not lost a game since his junior year in high school -- or three  years ago.  </P> <P> SDSU will play Spain's national team in an exhibition game at 5 tonight at  Smith Field.  </P> <P> UC San Diego will be playing on a new baseball field when it opens its season  at 2 this afternoon against Christ College Irvine.  </P> <P> The old field, about 500 yards away, is now the site of the new medical center  being built at UCSD. Part of the arrangement for building the hospital was that  the Tritons would get a new field.  </P></p>

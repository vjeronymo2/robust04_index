			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Renata de Freitas] </F>   [Text] Sao Paulo, 23 May (AE) -- The Brazilian Government  is giving signs that it has revised its foreign trade policy.  With seven months remaining before the institutionalization of  the Common Market of the South (Mercosur), Finance Minister  Rubens Ricupero recently defended the Brazilian role as a  "global trader," and argued that "the regional level is less  attractive" for the country. He said integration into the  Southern Cone is still a priority for Itamaraty "as long as it  promotes an open regional organization with a liberalizing  outlook."    According to Denot Medeiros, the Brazilian under secretary  for integration, Brazil has adopted "a dose of pragmatism and  realism" in its foreign policy. He defines the various areas of  Brazilian foreign trade policy as "concentric circles." Mercosur  fits within the South American Free Trade Area (SAFTA), which in  turn fits within hemispheric integration. Medeiros noted,  however, that Brazil is "neither interested in, nor capable" of  now joining the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).    Medeiros assigned the same degree of priority to both SAFTA  and Mercosur, a position which is different from that conveyed  by Rubens Barbosa, who was in charge of integration until late  last year. Barbosa said "Mercosur continues to be the priority  for Brazilian foreign trade policy" and that, despite reflecting  a very significant idea both politically and economically, SAFTA  should be left for the next government. "A growing priority is  being assigned to Mercosur," Barbosa said.    Professor Paulo Casella, the creator of a course on economic  integration law at Sao Paulo University, has identified the  first signs of change in Itamaraty's policy, and criticized the  lack of consistency. He said: "No program may be left entirely  to political intiative because politics is extremely volatile."  He added that there is "a risk of wasting many years of effort."    The revision in Brazilian foreign trade policy has taken  place following the Uruuguay Round of the GATT talks, that is,  since GATT approved a global trade policy. The reduction of  import duties reduced the significance of regionalization. In  Casella's opinion, "Mercosur is in no way a straitjacket."    The American Chamber of Commerce, which consists of more  than  800 affiliated companies, does not view NAFTA as a stumbling  block for the Brazilian global strategy, either. "One can move  on all fronts at the same time," argues journalist Brian  Nicholson, who wrote an editorial commentary entitled "Today the  World; Tomorrow NAFTA?" published recently in a bulletin of the  Chamber.    Ricupero said the diversification of Brazilian foreign trade  has been "impressive." Brazilian trade can be broken down as  follows: 26 percent with Europe, 24 percent with Latin America,  20 percent with the United States, and 16 percent with Japan and  Asia. He noted that there are 200 significant export items.  Medeiros said "the idea that multilateralism and regionalism are  incompatible is false." He noted, however, that this is true as  long as there is "a liberalizing regionalism."</p>

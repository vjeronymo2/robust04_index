			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / TV networks to warn on violence THE four US television networks, under congressional pressure to shield children from shows displaying violence, yesterday agreed to air warnings to parents just before the start of such programmes. The agreement - unveiled by senior officials of ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox - comes amid growing concern in Congress about the possible harmful effects of television violence on viewers, particularly children. Congress members had warned the networks that they might seek legislation to impose a rating system on programmes, similar to that applied to cinema films. In an attempt to head off such a system, the networks say that they will decide which programmes merit a parental warning, based on the degree and the context of violence shown. This independent initiative will come into effect in the autumn, the warning being shown before the start of shows and being available for publication in programme guides. However, the system does not yet cover the cable television networks, which account for a large and growing slice of Americans' viewing, nor does it extend to cartoons. Mr Howard Stringer, president of CBS, acknowledged that the networks were likely to lose some advertising business from shows carrying violence warnings. Mr Reed Hundt, a Washington lawyer known mainly for work in anti-trust litigation, has been nominated by the Clinton administration to head the Federal Communications Commission, the government body which oversees telecommunications and media. Mr Hundt, 45, would succeed Mr Alfred Sikes, a Republican who resigned in January when Mr Clinton took office. The new nominee is a close associate of Vice-President Al Gore, who is playing a leading role in communications policy.</p>

			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / US manufacturing decline continues US manufacturing declined for the second month running in January, according to figures yesterday from the National Association of Purchasing Managers, Michael Prowse reports from Washington. The association said the Purchasing Managers' index - a closely watched gauge of industrial conditions - registered 47.4 per cent last month. After revisions to previous data, this was the same level as in December and the weakest reading since last May, when the economy staged a partial recovery from recession. Readings of below 50 per cent indicate the manufacturing sector is contracting. The low reading for the index follows a spate of gloomy data last week, including a 0.3 per cent drop in the index of leading indicators in December and a 5 per cent decline in new orders for durable goods. 'The economy drifted into 1992 at the same listless pace as it left 1991,' said Mr Robert Bretz for the association. Manufacturers were reluctant to rebuild inventories because of doubts about the recovery. He said the downward trend in the economy, at best, had stabilised. The association's indices showed that production was static and new orders were barely growing. Export orders, while still positive, were the weakest for four years. The index of manufacturing employment signalled contraction for the 33rd month. In a separate report, the Commerce Department said construction spending fell 0.2 per cent in December and by 9.3 per cent in 1991 as a whole. This was the first annual decline since 1982 and the biggest drop in 47 years.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pristina, 5 May (TANJUG) -- Douglas Hogg, minister  of state in the UK Foreign Office, said in Pristina today that  both the British Government and the international community are  of the view that the issue of the rights of Albanians of Kosovo  and Metohija will have to be resolved within the borders of  Serbia. I wish to say that Kosovo is part of Serbia and we do  not believe that the borders should be changed. We also think  that there is no need for an independent state on the territory  of Kosovo, Douglas Hogg told journalists, following his talks  with Milos Savovic, governor [nacelnik] of the Kosovo district.  The main tasks are to find ways of implementing the political,  cultural, and civil rights of the Albanian community in Kosovo  and to allow the Albanians to play a full role in political and  administrative life, Hogg said.    The British minister of state continued his visit by talking  to ethnic Albanian representatives in Pristina.</p>

			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / Land sale boosts Leyland buy-out BIRMINGHAM Heartlands Development Corporation has announced that it is to buy 42 acres of surplus land from the Leyland Daf vans management buy-out team at a price of Pounds 4m, Kevin Done and Paul Cheeseright write. The Department of the Environment is giving the development corporation a grant to fund the purchase. The land will be turned into an industrial park. The development corporation said that the purchase would 'release Pounds 4m of much-needed working capital' for the Leyland Daf Vans management buy-out team. As well as helping to protect the remaining 975 jobs at the van plant, it also was hoped that the site could generate more than 1,000 inner-city jobs during the next five years.</p>

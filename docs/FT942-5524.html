			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / International Company News: Leif Hoegh in NKr195m purchase of shipowner Leif Hoegh, one of Norway's largest shipowners, has agreed to acquire control of Arcade Shipping, a small Norwegian shipowner, for NKr195m (Dollars 26.3m). It is buying 83 per cent of Arcade from Reading and Bates, the US-based drilling contractor, and plans a full takeover of the company. The deal is part of a package in which Reading and Bates has agreed to acquire a 46 per cent stake in an Arcade unit, Arcade Drilling, for NKr6 a share or an estimated NKr300m. In addition, Reading and Bates will acquire Arcade Shipping's minority shareholding in Dragon Oil for NKr18.26m, representing book value of the interest. Arcade's shareholders must agree to withdraw a legal claim against Reading and Bates for the US group's earlier purchase of Arcade Investment. Leif Hoegh is paying NKr1.80 a share. Arcade's shares prior to news of the deal were trading on the Oslo bourse around NKr1.45. Leif Hoegh will make a similar offer to minority shareholders. The deal brings to Leif Hoegh one bulk ship and three smaller RoRo ships. Leif Hoegh said that Arcade's fleet fits well with its own activities.</p>

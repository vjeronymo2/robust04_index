			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / World Trade News: Delors warns Clinton over trade war PRESIDENT Bill Clinton said yesterday he did not foresee a trade war with the European Community, but EC commission president Jacques Delors said he remained concerned about the threat of a transatlantic trade war. After a meeting at the White House, Mr Delors said he had warned the president of serious consequences if the US carried out a threat to retaliate next week in a US-EC dispute over bidding for government contracts. 'The retaliation that is planned is not good for the mood between the EC and the US,' Mr Delors told reporters. Although he remained concerned about the possibility of a trade war, he added: 'I am ever optimistic.' Mr Delors said he was happy with Mr Clinton's 'open attitude' and with the 'spirit of co-operation' between the EC and US. Mr Clinton's assurance came in response to a reporter's question before the meeting. 'I don't want a trade war with the EC and I don't think we'll have one,' he said. The meeting, which lasted more than an hour, comes after mounting tensions between the US and EC over a number of trade issues, including steel duties and Airbus subsidies. Before the Oval Office meeting, Mr Delors described summits of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations as 'a Barnum circus with 3,000 journalists,' and called for radical reorganisation of international economic organisations. 'The G7 should be setting an example but all it can offer is platitudes,' he told the International Management and Development Institute, which brings together corporate executives and politicians from Europe and North America.</p>

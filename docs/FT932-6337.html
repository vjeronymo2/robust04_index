			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / International Company News: Northwest Air offers employees 30% stake NORTHWEST Airlines, the debt-laden US carrier which plans to integrate its operations with those of KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, is proposing to give employees a 30 per cent stake in the airline and three of the 15 board seats. The package is in return for almost Dollars 900m in pay concessions spread over three years. The carrier, the fourth largest in the US, had announced an agreement in principle with two main unions - the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, representing its flight attendants, and the International Association of Machinists - but did not spell out details until yesterday. The equity-for-concessions deal, however, still requires the support of other unions at Northwest - most notably, the airline's pilots. Northwest said negotiations with other labour groups were continuing. Northwest's general counsel, Mr Ben Hirst, said the carrier hoped the labour concessions would convince its banks to reschedule loan repayments. It seeks a significant reduction in payments falling due in the next few years. At present, Northwest has Dollars 1.015bn of payments due next year, Dollars 504m in 1995, and Dollars 519m in 1996. It is asking to cut that to Dollars 120m, Dollars 175m and Dollars 205m respectively. Proposals to the lenders will go today.</p>

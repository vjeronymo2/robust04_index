The statement condemend the heinous  crime and reaffirmed Sudan's (?denunciation) of the failure and  conspiracies of the great powers.    The statement condemned the UN Security Council's negative  stance towards the massacre. It expressed Sudan's concern over  the international community's silence in response to the  violation of human rights in Bosnia. The statement said that  what the Serbs were doing in Bosnia was unprecedented since what  the Nazis did during the Hitlerite era and that the UN's failure  was exactly like the League of Nations' failure to stop the  crimes of the Nazis, which lost it the confidence of the peoples  of the world (?at that time).    The statement appealed to the peace-loving forces and all  states to confront this inhuman (?whirlpool), to stand firmly by  the Muslim people of Bosnia, to pressure the Security Council  into discharging its duty to protect the Bosnian people's  legitimate rights and lift the arms embargo imposed on the  Bosnian people to enable them to defend themselves, strike at  the Serbian forces to destroy their military concentrations and  to immediately evict them from the Bosnian territories.</p>

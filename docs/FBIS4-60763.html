			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by "first group of the Bani Walid youth"; place </F> and date not given -- recorded]    [Text] The statement issued by the first group of  revolutionary youth of Bani Walid:    To the leader of the nation and its liberator,    At these glorious moments in the life of our free Libyan  people who resist tyranny, combat the new Western invasion,  shoulder the responsibility for liberating our great nation, and  struggle to smash the insulting agreements of humiliation, at  these bitter and painful moments in the lives of our Arab  nation, our steadfast people in Palestine, our unionist people  in Yemen, and the rest of our Arab peoples who are downtrodden  in the Gulf by American hegemony, who are at the mercy of the  Israelis in Syria, whose national unity in Egypt and Algeria is  threatened by Western intelligence conspiracies, and who are  exposed in the dear Arab Maghreb to French arrogance, the first  group of the Bani Walid revolutionary youth are honored to meet  you and to draw from your inspired thinking.    We emphasize the following:    First: Our complete readiness to smash the traitors, those  who spread rumors, reactionaries, and those who...[incomplete  sentence as crowd start chanting];    Second: There is no alternative to the people's authority  and  there is no legitimate political framework except the Basic  People's Congresses;    Third: We are now obliged to smash the tribal, sectarian,  and  partisan spirit in order to preserve the unity of our people  under confrontation circumstances, in order to carry out the  sacred defense of our national entity, and in order to  strengthen our national unity that is attacked by enemies within  and without; [chanting]    Fourth: In reply to foiled attempts by the enemies to  infiltrate our home front, today we announce our revolutionary  resolution to liquidate the stray dog CIA agents. [chanting].  The death penalty will pursue all officers of the Western  intelligence services who are trying to fragment the home front,  violate the security of the Jamahiriyah or the person of our  leader, or recruit any sick person to serve their sordid and  despicable aims; [chanting]    Fifth: We would like to emphasize to the crusading enemies  and local and Arab treacherous forces allying themselves with  them that the results of besieging the Jamahiriyah will not be  better than the results of besieging Yathrib, and that we will  soon launch an attack to smash the strongholds of reaction and  imperialism as the soldiers of the Prophet smashed the  strongholds of atheism and falsehood in Mecca.    At the same time, we warn everyone who tries to play the  role  of Bani Quraydhah Jews who broke their promise, tried to stab  the Muslims in the back, and formed a fifth column behind the  moat [during the siege of Yathrib] that our revenge will not be  less than the revenge of God's Messenger, may God's prayers and  mercy be upon him, and we will not be more merciful than him.  On the contrary, we will be more severe and cruel. [chanting]</p>

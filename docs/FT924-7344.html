			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Nestle buys Clarke ice-cream business NESTLE, the world's largest food manufacturer, has bought most of the assets of Clarke Foods, the UK's second largest ice-cream producer, which went into receivership last month. The Swiss group's purchase, from receivers Robson Rhodes, marks its first move into the ice-cream market in the UK. The value of the deal was not disclosed, though Nestle said it was not assuming any of Clarke's debts, totalling about Pounds 25m. The assets acquired include four factories and the ice-cream brands of the Lyons Maid business, such as Fiesta, Zoom, Fab and Mivvi. Clarke bought Lyons Maid for Pounds 12m last year but paid only Pounds 7.5m of the price before going into receivership. Mr Peter Blackburn, chairman of Nestle's UK subsidiary, said the brands had a strong heritage and a great potential for development. Nestle's immediate priority was to pick up the running of the business and ensure continuity of supply. The company is due to meet Clarke's management today and will spend several weeks carrying out a detailed study of the business. Clarke accounted for an estimated 13 per cent of total UK ice-cream sales of about Pounds 800m last year. Its market share today is far lower, following production problems which prevented it from achieving more than a quarter of its planned sales last summer. Since a severe shortage of working capital caused the company to be placed in receivership, its workforce has been cut from about 600 to 300 people. The company has factories in Greenford, Stourbridge, Telford and Liverpool and recently invested modern production equipment. It also has eight sales offices. Nestle has ice-cream operations in France, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland, the US, Latin America and North Africa. It formed a joint venture earlier this year with Dairy Farm of Hong Kong to make ice-cream in China.</p>

			<p><P> February 14, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NBA / SAM MCMANIS;  </P> <P> THIS TIME AROUND, THINGS AREN'T SAME FOR LAKERS AND PISTONS  </P> <P> No friendly Valentine's Day pecks on the cheek will be exchanged between Magic  Johnson and Isiah Thomas at half court before the tipoff of tonight's  Laker-Detroit Piston game at the Forum.  </P> <P> Unless, of course, Johnson hobbles out there in street clothes to greet his  close friend.  </P> <P> But that will not be the only change when last season's National Basketball  Assn. playoff finalists meet for the second, and last, time in the regular  season.  </P> <P> In a mild surprise, neither the Pistons nor Lakers have the league's best  record. The Cleveland Cavaliers resume play after the All-Star break three  games ahead of Detroit. The Lakers rank third overall and first in the Western  Conference.  </P> <P> Both the Lakers and Pistons have had their share of problems this season, but  so far have endured.  </P> <P> The Lakers suffered through an eight-game road losing streak in December and  January, and are facing the prospect of being without Johnson, who has a torn  left hamstring, for an indefinite period. The Pistons, meanwhile, lost six  straight road games at one point, have only a 1-8 record against their top  three Eastern Conference rivals and have been rumored for weeks to be seeking a  trade.  </P> <P> Although the Pistons' 31-13 record is three games ahead of last season's pace,  Thomas said they still have not proven themselves to be a "great" team, such as  the Boston Celtic and Laker championship teams.  </P> <P> "We aren't a championship level team right now," Thomas said. "We still need to  improve as a basketball team. We can't become stagnant. We have very good  individuals, but we need to play together and become a team.  </P> <P> "Unless we do that, we won't get to the level of Boston and L.A. They've proven  that they have done it. We haven't proven anything yet. Part of it is  expectations. We want to win an NBA championship and we're pressing the issue.  We feel the pressure to have the home-court advantage."  </P> <P> For the Pistons to finish the regular season with not only the league's best  record but also make a return trip to the championship series, Thomas said  changes must be made.  </P> <P> "We've got to have some inside scoring," Thomas said. "We're a great basketball  team now when we're hitting the 'J' (jump shots). But our transition game is  not what it seems. When we force teams to shoot only (44.8%), we should be fast  breaking more.  </P> <P> "And, in the half-court game, we're relying strictly on jump shots. When we  make it, it's great. But, when we get in trouble, is when we don't."  </P> <P> After last season, the Pistons' expectations have been heightened, which may be  why Thomas and other Pistons are not satisfied despite a five-game winning  streak and the NBA's second-best record.  </P> <P> Coach Chuck Daly has been quoted as saying the Pistons desperately need a  post-up player who can score inside to seriously contend for the title.  </P> <P> There has been considerable speculation that the Pistons will trade forward  Adrian Dantley for Dallas Mavericks forward Mark Aguirre. A Dallas newspaper  recently reported that Daly and Dantley had an argument, though Daly denied it.  Aguirre has been quoted as saying that Thomas is pushing for the deal.  </P> <P> Because he is Aguirre's close friend, Thomas has been caught in the middle of  the trade rumors. Speaking to reporters during All-Star weekend at Houston,  Thomas said he has had no involvement in the Dantley-Aguirre affair.  </P> <P> "Do I expect anything to happen?" said Thomas, repeating a question. "No.  </P> <P> "Do I want anything to happen?" he repeated again. "No.  </P> <P> "Do we have everything it takes to win the NBA championship?" he repeated. "I  don't know."  </P> <P> Choosing his words carefully, Thomas said he is not sure such a trade would  ensure that the Pistons would win the championship. He also said reports that  he and Dantley do not get along are false.  </P> <P> "Mark Aguirre is a friend of mine, so that (speculation) naturally happens,"  Thomas said. "Sometimes rumors are true and sometimes not. Even before Adrian  Dantley came to the Pistons, people said we didn't get along -- and that was  before I even knew him. We've seemed to get along pretty good so far."  </P> <P> Thomas said he would welcome a rematch against the Lakers in the championship  series, simply because it would mean the Pistons had once again made it that  far.  </P> <P> But he does not place special emphasis on tonight's game. Nor does he think the  Pistons' 102-99 victory over the Lakers in Detroit Nov. 26 will mean much in  the whole scheme of things.  </P> <P> "If we go to L.A. and beat them without Magic, I don't know what that tells  us," Thomas said. "Because you can beat a team one or two or even three and  four times in the regular season, but it doesn't matter in the playoffs. Timing  is everything. When you get in a seven-game series with a team, that's when you  know."  </P> <P> Clipper guard Quintin Dailey's recent suspension for being overweight brings to  mind the near-legendary Dailey story from a few years ago when he played for  the Chicago Bulls.  </P> <P> Dailey was sitting on the far end of the Bulls' bench during a game when he  motioned for a ballboy. Dailey then instructed the ballboy to ask reporter Mark  Vancil, then of the Chicago Sun-Times, if he could borrow $10. Dailey then had  the ballboy go to the concession stand and purchase a hot dog, popcorn and a  soda, which Dailey ate during the game.  </P> <P> Add weighty matters: Dailey isn't the only player not active because of excess  weight. Miami Heat guard Pearl Washington has aggravated a groin strain twice  this season, and team officials believe it is because Washington is overweight.  </P> <P> Washington's injury has healed, but Coach Ron Rothstein said Washington will  not be activated until he loses 10 pounds. Washington weighs 213. He is listed  at 200 in the media guide.  </P> <P> "It's a very tender situation for him," Rothstein said. "Weight has always been  a problem, and if he's going to do anything, he has to learn. What's the sense  of putting him out on the floor with the extra weight so he can pull his groin  again?"  </P> <P> Statistic of the week: The Houston Rockets have a 10-0 record against the  Charlotte Hornets, Miami Heat and San Antonio Spurs. Against the rest of the  league, however, the Rockets are 18-18.  </P> <P> Charles Barkley was involved in another controversy on a Philadelphia radio  talk show last week, but this time Barkley wasn't even a guest.  </P> <P> A caller named Mary, a 76-year-old grandmother from Trenton, N.J., told the  host that she does not like Barkley because he is "mean and arrogant," and she  would not listen when the host tried to defend Barkley.  </P> <P> It turned out that Barkley was listening to the show, called the station and  went on the air to ask Mary to call back. She did not.  </P> <P> Barkley has since contacted the woman and invited her to a 76ers' game. He said  he is paying for her limousine service to and from New Jersey.  </P> <P> Most NBA players stay at home during the four-day All-Star break. But Charlotte  Hornets forward Robert Reid planned a trip to Morocco to meet with King Hassan  II.  </P> <P> Reid, an ordained minister, traveled there in his capacity as president of the  Global Youth Foundation. He was scheduled to meet with King Hassan to discuss  plans for the Junior Olympic Games in Casablanca in 1990.  </P> <P> The Houston Post recently polled NBA players (142 of 300 responded) on various  best-and-worst items, and both the Lakers and the city of Los Angeles are well  represented. A few of the categories:  </P> <P>  -- Michael Cooper was chosen by the players as the second-best defensive  player, behind Michael Jordan.  </P> <P>  -- Magic Johnson was voted as the "opposing player you'd least like to see  take the last shot," beating out Larry Bird and Jordan.  </P> <P>  -- Pat Riley won in two categories, "best dressed coach," and "opposing coach  you'd least like to see diagram the last play."  </P> <P>  -- Los Angeles is clearly a player favorite. It won for "best city to visit in  January," "best city to visit in April," "best night-life," "best restaurants"  and "best dressed fans."  </P> <P> However, the players polled selected Boston as the city with the most  knowledgeable basketball fans. Los Angeles finished third.  </P></p>

			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] Managua BARRICADA in Spanish of 19 April  1994 reports on page 10 Sandinist National Liberation Front  (FSLN) economist Alejandro Martinez Cuenca says in a commentary  that compensation of former owners is the key to resolving the  property issue. To this end, Martinez calls on the government  "to act immediately to guarantee that more than 600-million  cordobas paid out as bonds to former property owners retain  their value." He suggests that the use of compensation bonds be  expanded to include transactions taking place at state-owned  banks, the customs office, and the income tax directorate. Bonds  should also be used to complete the acquisition of shares for  properties privatized by the National Corporation of the Public  Sector begun in 1990. Martinez says that the government "should  not delay taking action to guarantee the value of the  compensation bonds."</p>

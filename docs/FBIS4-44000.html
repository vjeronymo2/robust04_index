			<p>BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Muhammad Salim Basindwah met in  Bonn today with Helmut Schaefer, German minister of state for  foreign affairs.    During the meeting, the brother foreign minister briefed the  German minister on developments in the Yemeni Republic,  stressing the Yemeni Government's eagerness to put an end to the  fighting imposed by the secessionist elements when they departed  from constitutional legitimacy and declared secession. He also  informed him of the attempts made by the government of the  Yemeni Republic before and after the situation exploded, as well  as the recent efforts to bring about a cease-fire and the call  to reactivate the Yemeni military committee, with the  participation of Jordan, Oman, the United States, and France.    Basindwah further asserted that the secessionist elements  have foiled all efforts and are working to escalate the  situation and violate the cease-fire each time it is announced.    He added that the Yemeni Government is still pursuing  efforts  to find a solution within a Yemeni framework that preserves the  national gains, primarily Yemeni unity, democracy, and  constitutional legitimacy.    For his part, the German minister of state for foreign  affairs asserted his government's concern about maintaining  Yemeni unity, continuing our country's democratic approach, and  working to cease fire in line with Security Council Resolution  924.    The meeting was attended by brother 'Abd al-'Uthman,  ambassador of our country to Germany.</p>

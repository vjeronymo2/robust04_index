			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / International Company News: TDK recovers in first half with 39.8% increase TDK of Japan, the world's largest maker of magnetic tapes and a leading producer of floppy discs, yesterday signalled that it was pulling out of a three-year profits decline, writes William Dawkins in Tokyo. A revival in demand for electronic components from US and Asian computer industry customers more than offset the continuing weakness in Japanese demand, to fuel a rise in current profits - before tax and extraordinary items - of 39.8 per cent to Y12.19bn (Dollars 124m) in the six months to September. The computer products improvement has continued in the current six months, due to stronger-than-expected demand for magnetic heads for hard disc drives because of the expansion in personal computer sales. As a result, TDK forecast full-year profits would rise by 41.2 per cent to Y20bn, above analysts' expectations. Overall sales, however, rose only a fraction in the first half, to Y172.65bn from Y172bn a year earlier, hampered by cost reductions. TDK expects full-year sales to rise to Y343bn from Y334.61bn last year. Turnover was also held back by weak demand for recording tapes, which represent more than a third of TDK's business. Sales of recording media fell by 4.9 per cent to Y64.5bn in the first half, while turnover in electronic materials and parts rose by 3.1 per cent. TDK's main cost-cutting technique, likemany other Japanese producers of low-margin goods, has been to shift production to cheaper locations in Asia and Europe.</p>

			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / International Company News: Consortium buys New Zealand Rail A US-New Zealand consortium has paid NZDollars 328m (USDollars 179m) for New Zealand Rail. It plans eventually to float some of the company - possibly 40 per cent - on the local stock market. Ms Ruth Richardson, New Zealand's minister of finance, said the deal, which includes the inter-island ferry service but excludes NZ Rail running track, is after NZDollars 62m of debt repayment. The consortium consists of Wisconsin Central Transportation, the biggest railway operator in the US, Berkshire Partners of Boston, a US equity investment group, and Fay, Richwhite, the New Zealand merchant bank. Fay, Richwhite said the flotation was planned for 1996 at the earliest once NZ Rail was able to demonstrate a consistent earnings performance under private ownership. Last year it made an after-tax profit of NZDollars 36.3m. Wisconsin Central operates across 2,000 miles of track in the US and Canada. Mr Ed Burkhardt, president, said his company intended to remain a long term investor in NZ Rail which would roughly double the size of Wisconsin Central. He said there were similarities, as his company's focus was on the haulage of forestry, coal, pulp and paper and dairy products. Mr Burkhardt said employee numbers at NZ Rail were 5,000, down from 27,000 in 1984. He said that while Wisconsin Central had 1,050 staff the companies were different. His company did not run a large ferry service or passenger trains which were more labour intensive. The New Zealand government will retain the right to introduce another operator on the railway line if freight and passenger traffic falls below 50 per cent of current volumes. Ms Richardson said NZ Rail would continue to receive a government subsidy at around the current level of NZDollars 28m a year. NZR also receives a regional bodies subsidy. She said these would assure continuation of the passenger service. NZ Rail would need a NZDollars 600m capital injection by the end of the decade and another NZDollars 800m by 2010.</p>

			<p><P> April 26, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> There will be no more aerobics classes and scanty lingerie on NBC's  "Nightingales" if the series is renewed for another season, producer Aaron  Spelling vows. Spelling called a Tuesday morning news conference at the Century  Plaza to announced that the American Nursing Assn., which has loudly protested  the show's racy depiction of the lives of student nurses, has now pledged its  support -- providing producers strive to create a more realistic portrait.  Spelling said rushed production and last year's writers strike forced the  show's producers to include scenes "we are not proud of." He added: "If a show  depends on young women changing their clothes every two seconds . . . we don't  want to do that show." ("Nightingales" airs tonight at 10.) ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

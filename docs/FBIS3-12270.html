Commenting on the massacre that took place at the Ibrahimi  Mosque in Hebron yesterday morning in which scores of  Palestinians were killed, 'Asfur told MENA that an executive  mechanism must be worked out for an international presence in  the occupied Palestinian territories.    He affirmed that the venue of the negotiations, whether it  is  Washington or any other place, is not a problem. The  negotiations that took place in Taba and Cairo went well,  particularly during the recent rounds. He noted that good  progress was made in the last week of negotiations. The  Palestinian delegation was anxious to reach an agreement to  implement the self-rule plan as soon as possible.    'Asfur said that the massacre in the Ibrahimi Mosque was  carried out by a group of inhuman people. It was directed not  only against the Palestinian people, but also against Israeli  Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin personally and the Israeli  Government.    He said that if Rabin and his government want the  implementation of the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of  Principles agreement, they must put a real end not only to the  actions of these settlers but to the Israeli settlements and  presence in the areas that will come under Palestinian autonomy.    'Asfur affirmed that what happened in Hebron proves that  what  is needed is not protection for the Israeli settlers but for the  Palestinian people, because they are the ones facing danger from  the Israeli settlers.    He expressed the hope that the Israeli Government will  realize this and will adopt tangible measures to reduce, limit,  and remove what could hamper the peace process.</p>

			<p><P> May 2, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COMEDY REVIEW;  </P> <P> SEINFELD AMUSES WITHOUT ABUSING;  </P> <P> AS HEADLINER FOR THE WELLNESS COMMUNITY'S BENEFIT SHOW AT THE IMPROV, HE WAS  FUNNY, BUT STAYED CLEAR OF DANGER.  </P> <P> Jerry Seinfeld may be the ideal comic for a benefit show. He's a clever  generalist, relaxed and nice, very nice. He does not offend gray-haired  mothers, frighten small children or get too wiggy for the working crowd.  </P> <P> As headliner for the Wellness Community's $100-a-plate dinner and show at the  Improv here Monday, he was funny without jagged edges. His 35-minute  performance amused but stayed clear of danger.  </P> <P> Sam Kinison fans might have been horrified, but not the organizers of the  event, who were trying to raise money to open a Santa Ana branch of the Santa  Monica-based cancer support group (see accompanying story). Seinfeld's  gentlemanly routine lacked toxic brilliance but had several bright, quirky  moments. Besides, it kept in step with the, uh, wellness feeling of the event.  </P> <P> Seinfeld's most provocative bit dealt with horses, like how is it we can turn  them into glue? And what about horse trailers: Do they have to be that  undignified, with the horse's derriere always hanging out? Doesn't that bother  them, make them embarrassed? That's about as ugly as it got.  </P> <P> The rest of the time, Seinfeld stayed with tried-and-true material. There were  some takes on Orange County -- particularly Irvine, "the kind of town where  everybody seems like they got a haircut that day." Strolling up and down Irvine  streets brings to mind "architects' renderings, where everything's perfect."  </P> <P> From there, it wasn't too far a reach to the Santa Ana Freeway and a bit on  traffic. Seinfeld wondered about the future: When they say it's going to get  worse, "do they mean it will start going backwards?"  </P> <P> Other familiar passages centered on shopping, being a kid and the differences  between men and women. Seinfeld found some interesting slants. When he visits  the supermarket, for instance, he sometimes reflects while walking down the  aisles and listening to the music: "Hmmm, I don't think I have that album."  </P> <P> Dennis Wolfberg served as host for the evening, providing several brief  monologues during the show, which also featured Steve Shaefer and Hiram Kasten.  </P> <P> Once you got accustomed to Wolfberg's delivery (he does some unsettling things  with his bulgy eyes, and finishes most of his jokes with a sonic exclamation  mark that makes it sound as though his vocal chords are looking for a way out  of his head), there were riffs to enjoy.  </P> <P> In keeping with the theme of the benefit, Wolfberg focused on health and  medical routines, many of which dealt with childbirth. Asserting that the  Lamaze technique was developed by a "disciple of Josef Mengele," Wolfberg said  that asking a woman to have natural childbirth is "like asking a man to  tolerate a vasectomy by hyperventilating."  </P> <P> The husband's role, meanwhile, is to "keep your wife from taking medication.  When she begs for it, you just say 'no.' "  </P></p>

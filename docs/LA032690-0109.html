			<p><P> March 26, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CAPSULE REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'LETTICE AND LOVAGE' MAKES FOR A MERRY EVENING  </P> <P> Fustian House in Wiltshire is the dullest stately home in England. Nothing  interesting has happened there for the last 400 years. So what is a poor tour  guide to do?  </P> <P> Make up an interesting history for the old place, says Lettice Douffet, a lady  as eccentric and exotic as her name. Her embellishments set in motion "Lettice  and Lovage," Peter Shaffer's enormously entertaining comedy about the unlikely  friendship between two very different women.  </P> <P> And when the women are played by such accomplished actresses as Maggie Smith as  the over-imaginative tour guide and Margaret Tyzack as her frustrated boss, it  makes for a merry evening indeed.  </P> <P> "Lettice and Lovage," a big London hit, opened Sunday night at Broadway's Ethel  Barrymore Theater, where the play should run for as long as Smith wants to do  it.  </P> <P> Tyzack is a worthy foil for the extravagant Smith. Bette Henritze also scores  as Lotte's dithering secretary. But there's no doubt that "Lettice and Lovage"  really belongs to Smith, and she revels in its glorious excesses. It's a  perfect marriage of star and story.  </P> <P> What other critics said:  </P> <P> Frank Rich, New York Times: "This is idiosyncratic theater acting of a high and  endangered order, not to be confused with the actress' tightly minimalistic  film work. If 'Lettice and Lovage' is but a modest excuse for it, what theater  lover needs any excuse whatsoever to have a rare reunion with Maggie Smith?"  </P> <P> Howard Kissel, Daily News: "At heart, the play is a celebration of the  imagination . . . . With these celebrants, there's great cause for rejoicing."  </P> <P> Clive Barnes, New York Post: "This is no mere one-woman triumph. Playwright  Peter Shaffer and his director, Michael Blakemore, have conspired with  actresses, the ebulliently bewitching Smith and a queen of more stately  necromancy, Margaret Tyzack, to produce an evening of enchantment and delight."  </P></p>

			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of China (4): The cage opens and the bird learns to fly - But China's economic flight path will remain erratic for some years / Economic reform THE 'bird in the cage' was how China's leadership described its approach to economic reform in the early 1980s: the nurturing of fledgling market forces within an overall central plan. But, as the bars of this cage have been progressively dismantled, China's economic bird has stretched its wings. Economic growth since 1978 has averaged an astonishing 8-9 per cent a year, the mushrooming of collective enterprises has reduced the share of the old state enterprises in total employment from 81 per cent in 1978 to less than 50 per cent today, China's share of world trade has doubled and 200m people have been released from absolute poverty. Nor has this new economic freedom been concentrated in a few southern and coastal provinces. From Guangdong in the south, past Jiangsu province on the east coast to Jilin province in the north, the evidence of dynamic economic change is evident to the eye: in the rows of advertising hoardings which line the streets of northern Tianjin, the construction cranes which dominate the Guangzhou skyline or the congested streets and overflowing market stalls of Shanghai. Yet the dismantling of the planning cage, and the decentralisation of economic decision-making, have caused severe economic and political difficulties for the government in Beijing. The next phase of reforms needs to find reformist solutions to the problems of growing inequality and macroeconomic instability if development is to continue at the same pace. Decentralisation has been the driving force behind China's economic dynamism. Reforms have occurred step-by-step, often province by province, with liberalisation occurring first in agriculture and only later in the banking and state enterprise sectors. The rapid output response to the decentralisation of farming kick-started reform, generating a substantial pool of savings which enabled local governments to encourage rapid growth in rural manufacturing. Equally important was the decision to allow selected provincial governments to set up development zones, offering tax and duty concessions to exporters and foreign investors. Again, the response in terms of export growth and, later, the volume of foreign direct investment was dramatic. This explicitly regional and decentralised approach has been important for a number of reasons: the central government has been able to test deregulation in particular provinces; provinces have been keen to compete with each other to attract investment; all have had strong incentives to encourage local enterprise and thus expand their own tax base. But this regional approach has also caused problems. By encouraging rapid growth in the southern and coastal provinces, the Chinese government has allowed the growth of wide income gaps between provinces. The World Bank estimates that 100m people still live in poverty, almost entirely in rural areas and more often in northern and western provinces where growth in rural enterprise has been much less dramatic. Beijing's reformers face, as a result, pressure from poorer provinces for aid from the centre combined with a large 'floating' labour force which, they say, threatens China's sacred 'social stability'. But, by allowing richer provinces more control over their own tax base and more power to offer tax concessions, the centre has been less able to redistribute revenue for spending on education and health. THE most immediate problem for Beijing is macroeconomic instability. China does not have the social and physical infrastructure to sustain growth rates in double figures. But, without sophisticated monetary and fiscal levers, the central government has not had the means to keep growth at a sustainable pace. Each time the bird has soared higher, it has fallen back to earth with a bigger, reform-threatening thud. The overheating in the first six months of this year illustrates the problem. Provincial governments and local central bank branches responded to last year's southern tour by Deng Xiaoping by effectively ignoring restrictions on credit creation. Rapid growth and real estate investment in urban and coastal regions was quickly followed by inflation as infrastructure bottlenecks developed and raw material prices soared. While the central bank had lost control of credit creation, the government could not quickly raise taxes or cut spending in the overheating provinces. For all the government and the World Bank's talk of 'indirect' measures such as interest rate increases, the government had no effective means, short of a blunt across-the-board clampdown, to slow the economy. Fortunately, this time the clampdown was enforced by reformers rather than conservatives. The need to develop more sophisticated policy levers poses a dilemma for reformers. Curing this boom-bust cycle requires a re-centralisation of economic power, particularly over monetary and fiscal policy. But, if reform is to progress, this re-centralisation must occur with the support of the richer provinces and without blunting China's regional dynamism. For this reason, vice-premier Zhu Rongji's determination to avoid a hard landing which would threaten support for planned reforms of the central bank, fiscal policy and the banking sector. But Mr Zhu's task is more complicated. As the economy has developed, the step-by-step approach to reform has become much harder. The central bank will not be able to use monetary policy effectively until the banking sector acts competitively. The banks cannot lend commercially until they are freed from the need to support loss-making state enterprises. But these state enterprises remain the main source of welfare services - housing, health and pensions. The state cannot allow them to go bankrupt, and workers dare not change jobs, until a new state welfare structure has been constructed outside the enterprise sector, a task which has only just begun. In short, the levers of macroeconomic control in China will remain difficult to use for fine tuning. Even if Mr Zhu succeeds in avoiding a hard landing and can reassert the central bank's authority, it seems doubtful that China has seen the last of its boom-bust cycles. The economy is now almost certainly too open, and market forces too deeply embedded, for China's bird to be re-caged. But its flight path will remain erratic for some years.</p>

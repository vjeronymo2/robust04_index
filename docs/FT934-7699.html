			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of China (28): New tensions emerge - Many farm workers migrate to the cities AN upheaval is under way in China's rural heartland where 900m people - three-quarters of the population - still live. Millions are starting to move to the cities, marking one of the biggest population shifts in China's history. The migration has presented Beijing officials with an alarming vision of the social transformation set in train by their reforms. The huddles of people camped in Beijing's railway station testify to the scale of the changes. Mr Du Wen Bei, 19, from a farming family in the south-west, has crossed the width of China with his friends to find work on the construction sites of the north-east. 'Jobs are easy to find up there, but there are no jobs at home at all,' he says. The current problems in agriculture partly stem from the successes of the past 15 years of liberalisation. The commune system imposed on farmers in the 1950s and 1960s sharply reduced agricultural yields, and output barely kept pace with the fast-growing population. However, after 1979, peasant households were allocated their own plots of land under contract. After fulfilling local quotas, they were allowed to sell the surplus in the markets that began to emerge. In the past two years, the government has also lifted state controls on most agricultural prices, and by the middle of this year, controls on grain and other food prices had disappeared in most parts of the country, the International Monetary Fund reports. The surge in agricultural output since 1979 was one of the first clear successes of the liberalisation programme and has given the government confidence to reform the industrial sector. But new tensions have emerged. The leap in agricultural productivity coincided with a steady rise in China's population, and Beijing ministries estimate that at least 130m of the total 333m agricultural labour force are now surplus to needs. On some ministry estimates, this figure could reach 200m by the end of the decade. Hence the migration - many of those people are now leaving their home provinces to look for work on construction sites or as maids, enticed by stories of bright lights and big cities. Discontent is also rising among those still on the farms. Although the rural standard of living has risen in the past decade, the gap between rural and town incomes has widened; official figures say that per capita income for peasants is Yn770 a year, less half that in the cities. In the past two years, farmers have seen their incomes squeezed by a fall in prices for grains, while the costs of fuel, water, pesticides and fertilisers have risen steeply. Their grievances were inflamed further in the spring when local banks failed to honour government IOUs for grain purchases. One western diplomat says: 'The problem arose partly because many local officials still regard peasants as serfs and don't take their needs seriously.' Although the central government gives the provinces money to buy the grain, many regions used their growing independence from Beijing to invest the money in real estate - they then lacked enough money to pay farmers. Provincial independence, combined with farmers' preference for growing only the most profitable vegetables, has given Beijing a further headache: production of some of the most important crops has become volatile. Following a disastrous cotton crop last year, production levels are expected to slump, even though China relies heavily on cotton production for textile exports. Tensions came to a head in Henan and Sichuan provinces in May and June when peasants, enraged by layers of taxes imposed on them, rioted and attacked local government officials. Beijing ministries were clearly rattled: 'The riots and the migration have told them that they are losing social control,' says one western observer. The government has wielded a range of tools to pacify the farmers and stabilise output of the main crops. It has ordered local banks to pay farmers promptly for the autumn harvest - the next few months will show whether this has been heeded. It has also continued to raise the price it pays farmers for some crops, and tried to establish a minimum price for the main grains. Further rises are in the pipeline, the agriculture ministry says, although the government's room for manoeuvre may be limited as the price of soya bean, cotton and corn is already close to world market prices. Beijing has also tried to put a ceiling on fertiliser costs, and is compensating farmers for some of the increases. According to the ministry of agriculture, the government is reconciled to maintaining these subsidies as the price of peace. Mr Xu Haijiang, division chief of its international division, and Mr Liu Zhenwei, deputy director of its central administration, says: 'In the past, the government used to pay a lot of subsidies for consumers and for factories. Now these subsidies are being reallocated to farmers.' Meanwhile, Beijing is taking steps to control migration directly. In the past few months thousands who were camped indefinitely at Beijing railway station have been dispatched home. During the rest of the decade, Beijing hopes that mushrooming rural businesses will soak up 50m of surplus rural labour. The government also plans to create 12,000 new small towns to absorb a further 20m, the agriculture ministry says. Beijing officials and western diplomats agree that China is not about to run short of food. Transportation problems may mean some regions find some foods hard to obtain but 'there is no shortage of farmers, no fallow land and no crisis of falling yields,' says one western observer. But Beijing will eventually be confronted by the social consequences of the changes it has set rolling, and by a difficult conundrum. Continuing to cushion the farmers from price liberalisation is expensive; removing the protection risks further loss of control; reversing the reforms jeopardises the past decade's success. In the agriculture ministry's words, the government's recent measures 'will alleviate the problems - but they will not solve them.'</p>

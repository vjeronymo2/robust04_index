During his stay in Paris, Li Qiyan made wide-ranging  contacts  with French industrial and commercial circles and briefed them  on the great situation in China's reform and opening up to the  outside world, particularly Beijing City's achievements in  introducing foreign capital and developing economy over the past  15 years.    Li Qiyan said: More than 8,000 foreign-funded enterprises  have been set up in Beijing City since 1978, bringing in $11.3  billion in direct investment and $2.5 billion worth of  technology to promote local economic development. He expressed  the hope that French entrepreneurs would enthusiastically invest  in Beijing to make new contributions to the development of  economic cooperation between China and France.    Li Qiyan also visited projects under the Paris Municipal  Government. This morning he made a quick trip to France's  largest wholesale market for agricultural and sideline products  at the southern suburbs of Paris to find out about Paris  residents' food supply. In addition, he attended a ceremony for  signing joint venture agreements between the Beijing Heavy  Electrical Machinery Plant, the Beijing Winery, the China  Packaging Industry Development Corporation, the Beijing Economic  and Technological Development Zone, and the Beijing  Huairou-Huaibei Cement Plant, and their French counterparts.  According to the agreements, the two sides will cooperate in  producing steam turbine, alcoholic and nonalcoholic drinks,  pop-top can, cement, and milk products in Beijing.    Li Qiyan arrived in Paris on the evening of 11 May at the  invitation of Paris District Assembly President (Giraud).  During his visit, Li Qiyan met with French Equipment,  Transport, and Tourism Minister Bernard Bosson to exchange views  on further developing Sino-French and Beijing-Paris friendly  relations and cooperation.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed item from "Inf. NA": "Lessons for the Future"] </F>   [Text] The inspection and final performance evaluation for  the winter training period has been completed among the troops  of the 38th Army Corps, commanded by Major-General Anatoliy  Kalashnykov. It was carried out by a group of generals and  officers from the central apparatus of the MO [Ministry of  Defense] of Ukraine headed by Deputy Minister of Defense of  Ukraine Colonel-General Ivan Bizhan. The results of the  evaluation have been summarized.    The principal conclusion drawn by the commission from the  inspection was the fact that the military formation is, as a  whole, able to fulfill the tasks entrusted to it to protect the  state sovereignty of Ukraine.    Many shortcomings were also noted as well, pertaining first  and foremost to the professional proficiency of the staff  officers, unit and subunit commanders and personnel. That  proficiency was conditional upon both objective and subjective  factors. The former include those connected with the difficult  economic situation of the country, where funds, fuel and other  material resources to support the combat readiness and everyday  activity of the troops are lacking. This was taken into account  in the inspection. But how to explain the negative attitude of  some of the senior and command officers toward the organization  of instruction in those military disciplines that do not require  large expenditures? The latter pertain to the maintenance of  discipline and regulation order, and the performance of official  duties. The commission ascertained that the state of affairs is  the worst in the military units headed by Colonel O. Kandiral,  Lieutenant-Colonels L. Tkachenko and S. Manayev, and Major V.  Ambros. A great deal of effort must be applied in order to  instill order in the mechanized regiment commanded by Colonel V.  Antsulov. The Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine became  personally convinced of this when he visited the units and  training areas.    However, as was pointed out at the council, the overwhelming  majority of the officers and their subordinates have done  everything in their power, despite all of the bad things and  difficulties, and tried to demonstrate what they had learned  during the last training period. The company tactical training  exercise with live firing that was visited by Minister of  Defense of Ukraine General of the Army of Ukraine Vitaliy  Radetskyy could serve as an example of that. He encouraged a  group of officers and soldiers in their skillful actions. The  exercise in the mountain training areas itself received a high  rating.    The troops of the 38th Army Corps (Carpathian Military  District) have given an accounting of themselves. But the  inspection continues. The baton has been passed to the Odessa  Military District as of May 23. The 6th Army Corps has to pass  final examinations. The conclusions that the commission from the  central apparatus of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine in the  Carpathian Military District, one would think, will be taken  into account there.</p>

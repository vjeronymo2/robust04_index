			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / International Company News: GiroCredit aims to remain independent GiroCredit, Austria's third largest bank, aims to remain an independent force in spite of the purchase by Bank Austria, the country's largest, of a controlling stake in it two months ago. Mr Herbert Lugmayr, Giro's new chief executive, said the bank would co-ordinate its activities with Bank Austria in a few areas where joint efforts were sensible, but would pursue its own strategies in most. It was planning a public flotation of shares within the next two years provided earnings improved and dividends could be restored. It expected to achieve an unchanged Sch2bn (Dollars 177m) operating profit this year, he said. Last February, following a two-year tussle between the two largest savings banks groups, Bank Austria and First Austrian, over the future shape of Giro, Bank Austria unilaterally bid for enough shares to take its 30 per cent stake to a small majority. Since April, when Bank Austria achieved its objective, analysts have been wondering how this socialist bank would treat its traditionally conservative acquisition. Its quick decision to appoint Mr Lugmayr as chief executive provided few answers. He is a socialist and spent most of his career in Zentralsparkasse, one of Bank Austria's predecessors, before joining Giro's management board in 1988. However, Mr Lugmayr said in an interview that Giro would remain a basically conservative bank. 'It will be independent from Bank Austria. They have not tried to exert pressure.' He said the two banks would co-operate mainly in foreign business and data processing. Also, Giro's highly rated capital markets department would be merged with Bank Austria Investment Bank. Giro would then concentrate on its core business, supplying various financial services to its savings bank owners throughout Austria.</p>

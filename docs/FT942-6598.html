			<p>940530 FT  30 MAY 94 / Big dipper leaves fans in suspense There were more red faces than white knuckles in Blackpool when the world's 'tallest, fastest and steepest' roller-coaster came to a halt during its public debut. Some 30 members of the roller-coaster's fan club were stranded two-thirds of the way up the 235-ft-high ride when it was stopped by an oversensitive computer controlling the trains. 'We don't know exactly why the computer stopped the ride,' said Ms Helen O'Neill, public relations director for Blackpool Pleasure Beach, the amusement park that features the 85 mph roller-coaster. 'It's so good that it's over-efficient.' Most of the 30 passengers stranded by the stoppageon Saturday remained unconcerned. They were brought down the ride's 65-degree drop after 10 minutes and given glasses of champagne. But the thousands of people who had been queueing for 1 1/2 hours had to be turned away while engineers checked for possible faults. 'We investigated for two hours to see if there was anything at all to make it stop,' said Ms O'Neill. 'We haven't discovered anything untoward.' The roller-coaster, put back in service later, was operating normally yesterday. The roller-coaster, built with 2,600 tonnes of galvanised steel, is named Pepsi Max Big One under a Pounds 1m, five-year sponsorship deal with Pepsi-Cola International's sugar-free cola drink. The roller-coaster ride was designed by Arrow Dynamics of Clearfield, Utah. Mr Ron Toomer, the company's president, suffers from motion sickness and sticks to designing roller-coasters by computer rather than riding on them. The Thompson family, which owns the 42-acre amusement park in Blackpool and paid Pounds 12m for the Big One, will keep its fingers crossed that there will be no repeat of the stoppage when the holiday crowds arrive in force today. Tomorrow they will be calling on their Utah consultants to investigate more fully. 'We'll be asking them if there's any way of toning the computer down,' said Ms O'Neill.</p>

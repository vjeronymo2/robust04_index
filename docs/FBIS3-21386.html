			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] New Delhi, Jan 21--India and Myanmar have signed a  Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on cooperation between their  civilian border authorities, to prevent illegal and negative  activities namely, trans-border movement of insurgents,  narco-traffickers and smugglers having adverse impact on the  economy as well as the socio-cultural and political fabric of  the two countries.    The MoU was initialled here on Friday by Mr N.N. Vohra, the  Union Home Secretary, on behalf of India and by Mr Wynn Lwin,  the Ambassador of Myanmar. The signing ceremony took place in  the presence of the Union Minister of State for Home, Mr P.M.  Sayeed, and the Deputy Foreign Minister of Myanmar, Mr Nyunt  Swe, who is currently visiting India as the head of a  seven-member delegation of his country.    The Foreign Secretary, Mr J.N. Dixit, and India's Ambassador  to Myanmar, Mr G. Parthasarthy, were also present at the signing  ceremony.    The two governments have agreed to take all necessary  measures to prevent inadvertent violations of each other's  territory by their security forces. They would also monitor and  curb effectively all illegal and negative activities such as  trans-border movement of insurgents, narco-traffickers and  others involved in nafarious activities. Meetings between  civilian border authorities would be held at the sectoral level  on a quarterly basis, and at the national level on an annual  basis.    The government considers the MoU a positive step and intends  to follow up on it quickly and effectively through certain  well-considered initiatives. The MoU is motivated by the shared  desire of the two governments to maintain good neighbourly  relations and to set up an effective consultation mechanism for  maintaining peace and tranquillity along the border.    India shares a long boundary with Myanmar extending 1,643 km  from Arunachal Pradesh to Mizoram. The terrain along the border  belt is densely forested and consists of steep and high mountain  ranges. The border is almost open and porous with numerous  jungle routes, a fact that helps smugglers, drug-traffickers,  insurgents and other trans-border criminals to pursue their  illegal activities across the border.    A border trade agreement was also concluded between the two  countries on Friday. It was signed by Mr. Tejendra Khanna, the  Commerce Secretary, on behalf of the Government of India and Mr  U Nyunt Swe, on behalf of the Government of Myanmar, in the  presence of the Minister of State for Commerce, Mr Kamaluddin  Ahmed. Mr G. Parthasarathy and Dr J.K. Bagchi, the Additional  Secretary in the Ministry of Commerce, were also present at the  signing ceremony, besides the eight-member delegation from  Myanmar. The agreement will be valid for two years and will come  into force from a date to be mutually agreed upon by the two  sides. It provides for border trade to be conducted initially  through the Customs posts across Moreh in Manipur and Champai in  Mizoram corresponding to Tamu and Hri on the Myanmar side. Trade  under the agreement may be in freely convertible currencies or  in currencies mutually agreed upon by the two countries,  including counter-trade arrangements.    Although in practice some form of border trade had been in  operation, there had so far been no provision for formalised  trade across the border with Myanmar. The agreement, which has  been signed following approval given by the Cabinet in the  recent past to the Commerce Ministry's proposal to formalise and  facilitate border trade, will help in furthering the economic  content in the relations between the two countries. It would  also help in developing the infrastructure in the border States  and increasing economic opportunities for people living there.  The agreement will have to be followed by infrastructural  arrangements required for the purpose, including the setting up  of customary check-posts, banking facilities, etc.</p>

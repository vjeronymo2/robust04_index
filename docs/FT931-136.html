			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / Airtours sells Owners stake AIRTOURS yesterday signalled the end of its bitter bid battle for Owners Abroad, selling its 8.2 per cent stake in its larger rival in the stock market at a considerable loss. Britain's third biggest tour operator built up the holding during the Pounds 290m hostile bid, paying between 144p and 150p per share. Dealers said yesterday that the shares had been sold for 117p, which would suggest a substantial loss. Smith New Court, the securities house, was believed to have bought the 12.7m shares and placed them with institutional shareholders. Together with its shareholding, Airtours had acceptances of only 43 per cent of Owners shares when its offer closed on March 16. After the defeat, Mr David Crossland, Airtours chairman, said the company would 'be watching developments at Owners Abroad closely.' There was no one available for comment at either Airtours or Smith New Court yesterday. Mr Howard Klein, chairman of Owners Abroad, said: 'I am delighted that Airtours has decided to dispose of its stake. Both companies can now get on with the business of selling holidays.' He added that he was not worried about the discount of the sale to Owners Abroad's current share price of 124p.</p>

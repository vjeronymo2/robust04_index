			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / Personal View: Palestinians need home-grown prosperity With the signing of the PLO-Israeli agreement, the international community and the Israelis have acquired a big stake in the economic success of the Palestinians. The initial response has been encouraging. The October 1 donors' conference in Washington garnered aid pledges of more than Dollars 2bn over the next five years, with about Dollars 600m pledged for 1994. It was also agreed the World Bank would have the main responsibility for co-ordinating aid. The aid numbers game is essential to focus the minds of the donors. But the aid effort will fail to foster sustained Palestinian economic development unless: the Palestinians manage their own economy, including establishing an agency to deal with the donors; aid does not exceed the Palestinian economy's capacity to absorb it; donors co-ordinate aid effectively; and there are rapid and visible improvements in economic conditions in Gaza and the West Bank. Not enough attention is being given to helping Palestinians develop a capacity to manage their own economy and rely on their own resources to finance development. A Palestinian economic administration will start by taking over the economic functions of the Israeli civil administration, now staffed by Palestinians with Israelis in upper management. Future Palestinian managers should begin working with the Israelis as soon as possible. They need to be trained now to deal with the massive challenges of running and redesigning the system. To avoid becoming too dependent on outside aid - a sure way of losing economic independence and eventually retarding economic growth - the Palestinians must develop their own sources of revenue. They currently pay about 13 per cent of gross national product in taxes, half to the civil administration. The Israeli-PLO agreement specifies that direct taxes in the territories be transferred to the Palestinian administration. They should also receive the remaining revenues, which include customs duties. Both economic independence and responsible government spending are enhanced if revenues come from taxation rather than foreign aid. The aid agencies, and the governments they represent, are powerful and could easily impose their priorities on the Palestinians. Thus the Palestinians need urgently to create an agency to set their own aid priorities and co-ordinate donors. Technical assistance to do this could be provided by university affiliated advisers. The assistance may be financed by aid agencies, but should not be provided by them. The overall size of the aid package should be guided by the capacity of the Palestinian economy to absorb it. With Palestinian GNP at less than Dollars 4bn and GDP at less than Dollars 3bn, massive amounts of aid (more than 12-15 per cent of GNP) could overwhelm the fledgling Palestinian administration and lead to greater economic dependence. The Palestinians and aid agencies will have to draw up detailed plans for economic assistance, for financing specific projects and for general budgetary support, before aid figures can be trusted. The World Bank's estimate that the infrastructure needs of the next 10 years amount to Dollars 3bn is only one element of the calculation. But it would be surprising if much more than Dollars 500m a year could be productively absorbed in the next few years. In eastern Europe, competing aid agencies overstretched the capacity of recipient governments and reduced the effectiveness of the aid effort. Donor governments in principle now recognise the need for aid co-ordination. They need to agree on an overall total for general assistance, to divide the total among them, and to select an agency to deliver the aid with appropriate conditionality. They also need to avoid an unseemly scramble for projects. The World Bank could handle both parts of the co-ordination task. It remains to be seen if governments permit it to do so. There is an urgent need for short-term financial assistance that produces visible improvements for Palestinians. Labour-intensive projects, improving roads and sewers and housing, can get under way within months. For the longer term, the economic policies of the Palestinian entity are more important than the amount of aid it receives. With free trade and economic co-operation with its neighbours, access to European and US markets, a well-designed aid programme and good economic policies, the Palestinian economy can gradually become economically independent and generate the prosperity that can sustain peace.

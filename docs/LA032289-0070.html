			<p><P> March 22, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> PARENTS TO BE FINED FOR CURFEW VIOLATORS  </P> <P> Parents can be fined up to $500 if their children are caught repeatedly  violating curfew laws under a new ordinance approved on its first reading  Tuesday by the Compton City Council.  </P> <P> Patterned after a new curfew law in Washington, which is experiencing a wave of  violent, drug-related gang activity, the ordinance amends the city's existing  10 p.m. curfew law.  </P> <P> "Hopefully, this will put some teeth in it," said Timothy Iverson, director of  the city's intergovernmental and grants office, which had the task of finding a  model for Compton's new curfew.  </P> <P> Under the ordinance, which must go through a second reading Tuesday, there is  no fine for the parent or guardian of a person under 18 who is arrested for a  curfew violation. For a second curfew offense, however, the fine will be at  least $100 and for the third or subsequent offenses can be $500.  </P></p>

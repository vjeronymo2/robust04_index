			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Investing for Income): The new rules test skill of managers The new rules for personal equity plans are keeping fund managers busy as they try to work out the best ways to take advantage of them. Andy Harrison, chief executive of Clerical Medical unit trusts - which postponed launching a new Extra Income trust, investing in fixed interest and equities in equal measures - says he can see a Pep with 45 per cent invested in gilts, 15 per cent in convertibles, and 40 per cent split between debentures and preference shares. Although a direct holding of gilts does not qualify for the full Pounds 6,000 annual general plan allowance, a unit trust which holds at least 50 per cent of its assets in eligible Pep investments does qualify. Harrison is cautious about using convertibles (shares or bonds which pay a fixed rate of interest and give the holder the right to convert them into the company's ordinary shares). This is because their link to the underlying share value makes them more volatile than preference shares or bonds. But Justin Urquhart-Stewart, a director at Barclays Stockbrokers, believes in convertibles as a way of offering protection against inflation. He says, however: 'These are the golden rules. Never buy a convertible of a company in which you would not want to be an ordinary shareholder. 'Make sure the income from the convertible is higher than the yield on the ordinary shares, and that the conversion premium is not so high that future conversion into the ordinary shares is unlikely.' He adds: 'If someone wanted high income with safety, I would suggest 40 per cent in bonds and preference shares, 40 per cent in convertibles, 10 per cent in cash, and 10 per cent in overseas (European or US) equities.'</p>

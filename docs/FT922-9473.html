			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / The Queen's Speech: No-win situation for Labour seats - Boundary changes and risked possible protests from its own supporters - by accelerating a review of parliamentary constituencies which would help the Conservative party at the next general election. The work of Boundary Commissions is seldom without controversy. Before the 1983 election, Mr Michael Foot, then Labour leader, tried to use the courts to prevent the last review's implementation. After the 1955 general election, when acrimoniously debated changes undoubtably helped the Tories to increase their majority from 17 to 60, there was a consensus that the period between reviews should be extended. The four Boundary Commissions (for England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland) were to report every 10 to 15 years, rather than every three to seven years. Now Mr Kenneth Clarke, home secretary, is risking charges of 'gerrymandering' by planning to reduce the period between reviews to eight to 12 years. More immediately, the Boundary Commissions' work, begun in 1991, will be speeded up. A statutory deadline of the end of 1994 will allow conclusions to be reached in 'good time' for the next election, the Home Office said. The work could probably be approved by parliament well before May 15 1997 - the latest date for the next general election. The consensus at Westminster is that the reviews will help the Tories to gain up to 20 seats. The 1983 review, which formed the basis for last month's general election, was drawn up on the 1976 electoral register. There have since been substantial movements of population out of inner cities - traditionally Labour's strongest areas. Mr John Major's constituency of Huntingdon, for instance, has an electorate of 92,913 while Birmingham Sparkbrook, held by Mr Roy Hattersley, Labour deputy leader, has only 51,677. But experience suggests that that will not stop complaints from Tory MPs who will lose out - such as in Chelsea which has an electorate of 42,371 - and even name changes could lead to local complaints.</p>

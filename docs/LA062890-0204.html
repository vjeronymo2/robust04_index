			<p><P> June 28, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SEN. GREEN'S GRANDDAUGHTER, 2 OTHERS HELD IN NORWALK GUNFIRE  </P> <P> The granddaughter of state Sen. Cecil N. Green (D-Norwalk) was arrested with  two other juveniles after they allegedly threatened to shoot a youth on a  bicycle in Norwalk and fired two shotgun blasts at a house in gang-related  incidents.  </P> <P> Sheriff's deputies declined to identify the three juveniles arrested and booked  early Tuesday on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon and grand theft  auto. No one was reported injured.  </P> <P> But Green, whose district includes part of Orange County, acknowledged that his  16-year-old granddaughter was arrested early Tuesday morning as a "passenger in  a car that was used in a drive-by shooting."  </P> <P> He said he had no other details but added: "If she has done something wrong,  then she should face what happens to her."  </P> <P> Green recently introduced several pieces of anti-gang and anti-drug legislation  in Sacramento.  </P> <P> Sheriff's deputies arrested a boy and two girls in a stolen car at 1:30 a.m.  Tuesday in Norwalk, Sgt. Steve Biagini said. A fourth person, a boy, escaped. A  shotgun was recovered, the sergeant said.  </P> <P> Shortly before 1 a.m., the four allegedly fired a shotgun twice as they drove  by the house of a rival gang member in Norwalk, he said.  </P> <P> About 10 minutes later, "they drove up next to a guy on a bicycle, and they  yelled out of the car some gang words," Biagini said. "They asked the guy where  he was from."  </P> <P> The teen-ager escaped on his bicycle as one of the other juveniles pulled out a  shotgun, he said. Biagini said he could release no other information about the  detention of the juveniles.  </P> <P> Green said that as far as he knew, his granddaughter had not been involved in  gangs. But he said his daughter and her two children moved from Norwalk to  Sacramento a year ago because "they wanted to make a move to change environment  and to change jobs."  </P> <P> The granddaughter had been visiting in Norwalk when she was arrested, he said.  </P> <P> "It's one of the big problems. Gangs and narcotics are going hand in hand,"  said Green, a former Norwalk councilman. "It hits almost all families and  areas, including my own."  </P> <P> The arrest came four days after gunmen shot a youth to death and wounded nine  others in a gang-related incident at a Norwalk graduation party. Sheriff's  deputies have stepped up patrols in the area since that shooting.  </P></p>

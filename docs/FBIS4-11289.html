			<p>BFN     [Text] A lack of ice and refrigeration at the distillery of  the Jesus Rabi Sugar Mill in Calimete Municipality, Matanzas  Province, is destabilizing part of the technological process of  production at that mill. Because of the lack of climate control,  it is not possible to maintain the stocks necessary to the  process. This also negatively affects the quality of the  different kinds of alcohol. Factory technicians say the  refrigeration problem has been public and under discussion and  analysis since January, when the work of that (?factory) began.    This problem has affected industrial efficiency in  fermentation as well as the mill's alcohol-producing work group,  on whom guaranteeing the quality of the product does not depend.  [sentence as heard] The product is a traditional one that has  many uses and is also exported.</p>

			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / 10,000 stand in county elections MORE THAN 10,000 candidates are standing for the county council elections in England and Wales on May 6. Tories in effect control 16 of the 39 English authorities. There is no overall lead for any party on another 14 although Tories rule on the chairman's casting vote at Hereford and Worcester, and Northamptonshire, and with the support of an independent at Wilt-shire. Labour controls eight English counties and Liberal Democrats one - the Isle of Wight. Five authorities in Wales have a Labour majority, two have no overall control and one is independent.</p>

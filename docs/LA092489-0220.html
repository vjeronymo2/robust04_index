			<p><P> September 24, 1989, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SANTA MONICA SCORES FAST, ROLLS OVER HARBOR, 40-13  </P> <P> Santa Monica College jumped on top of visiting Harbor College early Saturday  night and cruised to an easy 40-13 non-conference win.  </P> <P> The Corsairs scored on their first three possessions. The first came on a  nine-yard pass from Jeff Barrett to Phillip Frazier, culminating an 85-yard  drive. The second, a two-yard run by Charles McKinzie, capped a 78-yard drive.  The point-after attempt failed, but Santa Monica took a 20-0 lead several  minutes later when McKinzie's nine-yard run ended another 85-yard march.  </P> <P> Harbor (1-1) got on the scoreboard just before the first half ended when  running back Bill Harris reversed his field, turing a potential loss into a  56-yard touchdown run.  </P> <P> Consecutive Harbor turnovers enabled Santa Monica to blow the game wide open in  the second half. The Corsairs recovered a fumble at the Harbor 13-yard line,  then got a one-yard run by Frazier to increase their lead to 27-6. Then Adonias  Lucero's interception set up a 10-yard pass from Jeff Barrett to Travis Moore  to make it 33-6.  </P> <P> Harbor's Corey Henry scored on a one-yard run to make the score 33-13 after  three quarters. Santa Monica quarterback Ernie Soto capped the scoring with a  27-yard touchdown pass to Byron Jackson.  </P></p>

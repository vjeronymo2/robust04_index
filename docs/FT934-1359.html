			<p>931220 FT  20 DEC 93 / Aid lifeline for Ekostahl: An east German town which hopes to stop the rot Ingrid Kruger, 55, said: 'Its a nice Christmas present.' She worked at the Ekostahl steel mill for 27 years. But after German unification, like many other women in the plant, she lost her job. 'We waited three years for this decision from Brussels. It's a good day for the people of Eisenhuttenstadt. I just hope its for real.' Under the terms of Friday's European Union decision, the German government and the Treuhand privatisation agency will be allowed to pour more than DM1bn (Pounds 300m) of subsidies into the Ekostahl mill in the eastern state of Brandenburg. The subsidies will be used to modernise the plant as well as install a hot-rolling mill. Riva, the Milan-based privately-owned steel company which has sole negotiating rights to buy Ekostahl from the Treuhand, reckons the mill will have an annual capacity of about 2m tonnes after modernisation is complete. 'I don't care about levels of capacity. The most important thing is that the mill will stay open,' said Mr Ralph Bakema, a 42-year-old technician who has worked at Ekostahl for the past 20 years. 'You see, there's nothing else around here. Eisenhuttenstadt was built around the steel plant in the early 1950s. If that goes, we'll have nothing left. The shops and services won't have any customers. The region will be a wasteland.' The shopkeepers were hoping business would pick up before Christmas. There was little activity along the town's main street. People were standing at the make-shift market stalls, drinking hot mulled wine or beer, stamping their feet to warm themselves. A few Poles had arrived. They immediately opened their car boots and started selling toys. 'Money is scarce. People go across the border to shop,' said Heide, who was selling flowers. The border with Poland is only 20km away. 'Why should anyone set up a business here when the wages are one-tenth the price down the road,' she added. 'Maybe if we really get those subsidies and find a buyer for Ekostahl, business might pick up.' More than 8,000 of a previous 12,000 workforce at the mill have already been made redundant. The unemployment rate in the town of some 50,000 people is running at 23 per cent. The subsidies are not expected to guarantee all the remaining jobs. If anything, the modernisation plan will require even fewer workers. The people of Eisenhuttenstadt have few illusions. 'I'm not so sure about the future,' said Mr Helmut Appa, 52, who used to work at the plant until three years ago. 'We'll only get real security for a certain number of jobs once the plant is privatised. He added: 'We fought hard for those subsidies. The steel producers over in west Germany never showed the slightest bit of solidarity with us. And I know why. They were afraid that if we managed to get the subsidies, we would really become competitive.' Mr Helmut Eckhert, a retired craftsman, said: 'We should be given the chance to become competitive. And that is why we demand special treatment.' When it was pointed out that Ravenscraig in Scotland had to close its gates because of overcapacity, he said Eisenhuttenstadt was a different case. 'We lost everything after the Wende (fall of the Wall). We lost the markets, the subsidies, jobs for life, cheap housing. Everything has gone too fast,' he said. 'Now Brussels tells us everything. How much to produce, how much to grow. Its ridiculous the speed in which we have been plunged into these changes,' he added.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Vasylyy Ivanovych Yevtukhov, deputy prime </F> minister, Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers, by Valentin Khalin,  special correspondent: "Our Entrepreneurs Must Be Free To Handle  Both Money and Business on Their Own"]    [Text] Valentin Khalin, our special correspondent in  Ukraine, interviews Vasylyy Ivanovych Yevtukhov, deputy prime  minister, Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers, on the development of  entrepreneurship in Ukraine.    [Yevtukhov] The overall picture in our country is as  follows.  Last year we observed a precipitous growth of entrepreneurial  structures; it amounted to a factor of 2.6 as compared with the  preceding year. This includes the following growth factors: in  industry--2.3, construction--1.9, trade, public dining and food  services, as well as wholesale and middleman-type operations,  or--to put in more succinctly--in the trade group--4.9, and in  the finance-credit and insurance sphere--4.6. As a rule, these  are medium- and small-sized enterprises; despite such a  precipitous growth, the number of employees in them increased by  a factor of only 1.4.    This year there has been a decline in the growth rate of  small enterprises. There are several reasons for this. One of  them is the fact that many private entrepreneurs overestimated  their own powers and possibilities. At first everything  proceeded quite easily: They registered their own businesses,  obtained licenses, current enterprise accounts, seals or stamps,  and other requisites--all without any red tape. But then, in the  words of the old proverb: "It was smooth going on paper, but  they forgot about the ravines." Because, of course, even the  most capable and bold-spirited businessmen bear upon themselves  the brand of that leveling-mandatory distribution system which  all of us have been striving--with very great difficulty--to  break away from. I do not mean to say that such "owls" are  talentless people. On the contrary, among our businessmen there  are many, many imaginative and clever persons who can "spot"  their Western partners a hundred points. And it's a well-known  fact that when one of our fellow-countrymen was in the United  States, he noticed a price differential of only half a cent per  gallon on gasoline between two neighboring states; and he was  able to make some good money by using this knowledge. His  American colleagues could only spread their hands wide in  amazement; here was a profit which had slipped right through  their fingers. Most of our home-grown entrepreneurs, however,  are taking just their first steps in business. They are still  basically used to a kind of tutelage or guardianship: Give them  this and provide for that. And take, for example, the  psychological pressure from the people around them--people who  have created an aura of criminality around the entrepreneurs. It  must be admitted that one does occasionally encounter  money-grubbing self-seekers and tricksters among them,  but--taken en masse--they are persons with initiative, persons  who every day take the risk of losing everything which they have  earned so far.    However, I have digressed from the main point. On the whole,  the situation is really not too gloomy. During the present year  [1993] production at the state-owned enterprises declined,  whereas in the nonstate sector of the economy it has doubled.  Labor productivity is growing at small enterprises, marking time  at collective enterprises, and sharply declining at state-owned  enterprises. In my opinion, these indicators speak for  themselves: We must open up a wide expanse for private  initiative.    [Khalin] Do you mean, Vasylyy Ivanovych, that the decisive  word lies with privatization, and that it needs to be given a  helpful push, as is now being done in Russia?    [Yevtukhov] Privatization is not a panacea for all our ills,  but rather only one of the means for enhancing the efficiency of  our fixed capital. Yes, the Ukrainian government is in favor of  privatization, but not for one and all--not in any blanket  sense. Take, light industry, for example; It gives a quick  payback to the service sphere, and this proceeds less painfully.  But in heavy industry--for example, in the metallurgical and  chemical industries--we must approach this matter more  carefully: Here we should begin with the subdivisions and  individual units. One would not privatize a blast-furnace shop,  but you could do so in the case of a transportation shop  connected to it. The same thing pertains to management  structures. Take the West, for example. There the steel-foundry  branch is a state-run sector, whereas management is private.  What I mean to say is the following: In each case it is  necessary to seek out the optimum forms of combining interests.  On the one hand, to develop private entrepreneurship, while--on  the other hand, to demonopolize production, to make it  competitive, flexible, and easily manageable.    In short, I am for a selective, smooth, gradual process. To  my opponents, who zealously insist on "speeding things up," on  transferring Western models to our soil, I cite the following  argument: If Western models were mechanically transposed to our  realities, things would turn out as they did in the case of  Disneyland in France. Remember how many delighted exclamations  there were: The American "Land of Dreams" right near Paris! But  what happened? It was almost an embarrassingly awkward  situation. The public did not exactly flock to Disneyland in  droves. For the skeptical, rationally minded Frenchman a  "dream"--as the saying goes--is something fit for lightbulb; he  has another way of life, another set of values.    This example, of course, is somewhat abstract or even  farfetched. I simply want to point out that privatization will  work better if it conforms to our customs, habits, and--in the  final analysis--to our predilections.    [Khalin] How is this to be achieved in practice? What is  being done by the Ukrainian government in order to develop  entrepreneurship?    [Yevtukhov] A long-term State Program has been approved for  supporting entrepreneurship. It provides financial, legal,  informational, and educational-methodological assistance  primarily to those who are capable of breathing life into the  priority spheres of economic activity: processing and storing  agricultural products, construction and the construction  industry, as well as innovations. This work is being coordinated  by the Ukrainian State Committee for Assisting Small Enterprises  and Entrepreneurship (Goskompredprnimatelstvo). Within this  committee a National Fund for Supporting Entrepreneurship and  Developing Competition has been created. It is being financed  both from the budget as well as by funds from the entrepreneurs  themselves.    We are paying a great deal of attention to forming a  normative base, along with a financial and tax policy for the  nonstate sector of our economy. Draft laws on small business,  licensing, commercial secrets, and a number of other matters  have been submitted to the parliament for examination and  consideration.    The goal of this program is to give a new impulse to  unleashing business initiative so that it may become a  noteworthy force in the economy. As of today, 50,000 small  enterprises, 10,500 cooperatives, and 15,000 private farms are  producing 10-12 percent of our national product. By the year  1995 the number of entrepreneurial structures will reach  300,000, that is to say, it will more than triple. There will  also be a corresponding increase in their proportionate share of  the national product.    [Khalin] Would you kindly tell us, Vasylyy Ivanovych, how  economic ties with Russia are being built up on the level of  small enterprises, and what kind of a line is being maintained  here by the Ukrainian government.    [Yevtukhov] We are in favor of openness and mutually  profitable cooperation. It is not important where capital is  invested just so long as it operates in the interests of the  entrepreneur and the state. The main thing is not to interfere  in how people handle money and business. By increasing his own  income and wealth, a businessman also enriches his own country,  provided that he pays the correct amount of taxes. Therefore, we  are in favor of minimal regulations with regard to economic  ties: Let the entrepreneur himself seek out profitable direct  ties. Naturally, no barbed wire along our border with Russia is  needed just so long as the existing customs agreements are lived  up to. They allow us to fix and calculate goods turnover, tax  revenues, distribute and pay back credits, and so forth.    By my education and previous work experience I am a  technical  person. Therefore, I know the following: When a complex  electronic system gets out of order (and this may be extended by  analogy to the former Soviet Union), its adjustment and  fine-tuning proceed unit by unit. This is also the case with  regard to the bilateral ties between Ukraine and Russia. We must  meet each other halfway, including in the development of  entrepreneurship, set up and fine-tune mutually advantageous  "units" of ties, strengthen them, and the main thing--let me  repeat--is not to interfere in the unleashing of business people  themselves, not to surround them with a petty kind of tutelage.  A narrow-minded business attitude is not tantamount to an  efficient, businesslike approach.    [Khalin] One last question, Vasylyy Ivanovych. The Ukrainian  press, as well as numerous forums of business circles, have been  sharply critical of the government for the disintegration of the  economy, the unbridled inflation, and so on. Do you have a  specific program for getting us out of this crisis?    [Yevtukhov] Yes, I do. And as to the criticism, can you name  me even one state in the world where there are no dissatisfied  people? We place great hopes on the coming year. We will have  elections to the parliament, and--to my way of thinking--in our  contacts with the legislative branch we will give a new impulse  to the reforms and start to enter into a market economy at a  more rapid pace.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Lagos, 10 May (AFP) -- Moshood Abiola, the  self-declared winner of the 12 June 1993 presidential elections  annulled by the military, has announced his intention to form a  "government of national unity" and has asked General Sani  Abacha's "illegal" government to bow out of office, THE NEWS  magazine reported in its latest issue published today.    The multimillionaire Yoruba Muslim from southwest Nigeria  maintained that "the only way to halt the present backsliding of  the country into complete economic catastrophe, chaos, and  collapse" is to concretize the mandate which, according to him,  the people conferred on him on 12 June. He said he has  therefore "decided to form a government of national unity whose  legitimacy stems from the 12 June mandate. Further details on  the concretization of this program will be announced in due  course."    Mr. Abiola also called on "Gen. Abacha and his unelected  team...to immediately vacate all the government functions which  they have illegally filled and are performing." The immediate  task of the "government of national unity" will be to put the  country's economy back on its feet, to fight poverty, and to  restore the democratic rights of all Nigerians, he said.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] In an exclusive interview conducted by 'Adil Malik  for Jordan Television, His Majesty King Husayn has made the  following remarks:    [Begin recording] [Malik] Your Majesty King Husayn: You  have accustomed Jordanians to being informed about developments  that concern them. What do you have to say to your compatriots  today, following this meeting with the U.S. secretary of state?    [Husayn] I believe that the meeting was fruitful and useful.  The climate of the talks was cordial and frank. Concerning the  issue that is the focus of attention, it is the issue of peace.  He [U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher] is obviously on  his way to the region to activate things in a positive  direction. I have learned that they [the Americans] have the  same concerns we have concerning the fact that, for various  reasons, enthusiasm for peace has recently suffered some  setbacks. The parties concerned also feel this. Progress on a  certain pivotal track has been very heartening. This is what I  have to say as far as the issue of peace is concerned.    As for another issue that we addressed, it is the issue of  al-'Aqabah. It concerns the treatment of Jordan in a manner  that could no longer be accepted or condoned. They have  accepted our view. It seems that the issue is about to be  resolved appropriately and satisfactorily. We expect....    [Malik, interrupting] Can we expect a change in the method  of  inspections?    [Husayn] The blockade will be ended very soon. The ships  that have been deployed there will be moved. A proper  arrangement involving the use of a neutral party will be in  place, something that we have proposed (?from the outset).    [Malik] Sir, one last word on the fate of the peace process.  Have you seen any new horizons for addressing the problem at  this point?    [Husayn] Sir, as far as I am concerned, the problem does not  lie with the question of peace. For peace is undoubtedly a  great objective. But, at the same time, one should contemplate  the alternative should efforts fail, and should we fail to  achieve anything. The peace I am speaking of is a durable,  just, and comprehensive peace that future generations can  accept. This is what we insist on and focus on. It seems to me  that there are still great hopes for efforts to move in this  direction.    [Malik] Thank you, sir.    [Husayn] Thank you, sir. [end recording]</p>

			<p>940829 FT  29 AUG 94 / Emerging Markets: Lebanon attempts to rebuild markets as interest returns International finance houses are gearing up for business in Lebanon as the country's reconstruction programme gets under way, writes James Whittington, recently in Beirut. French, British and American merchant banks are looking at its prospects as a regional capital markets centre in the Middle East. French banks which include Credit Lyonnais, Paribas and Banque Nationale de Paris Internationale are well established with offices in Beirut. The London-based Robert Fleming will join them, together with Merrill Lynch of the US, with a regional office in the city by the end of this year. Baring Securities of the UK has just published a book on Lebanon and a British Invisibles delegation will be visiting Lebanon in October. The stock market is still in its infancy. There is only one listed company, Solidere, a Dollars 2.5bn property-development company set-up to rebuild the centre of Beirut. Trading in its two classes of shares began at the end of June, but less than half have so far been distributed. Massive demand and low turnover have fueled a price rise of more than 50 per cent. The market is waiting for the rest of the A shares, which are being allocated to the owners of land and property rights of the land earmarked for development, to come on to the market by the end of the year. B shares, issued through a Dollars 650m subscription earlier this year, was oversubscribed by 42 per cent. The shares are restricted to Arab nationals and property holders. Paribas, however, has won approval to buy a stake on the basis of its having had an office in the city centre before the war. The bank is issuing warrants, open to all investors, on its holding. It may be some time before a fully-fledged stock market is set up. A committee has just been appointed to draw up its regulations and there are only a few companies ready for listing. However brokers in London believe the potential is huge in terms of privatisations, and giving assistance to publicly and family-owned companies which want to raise capital.</p>

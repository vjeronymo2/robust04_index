			<p>BFN       [Editorial report] Tel Aviv HA'ARETZ in Hebrew on 26 May  carries a 1,500-word article by Amnon Barzilay on page B3, in  the "I Saw, I Heard" daily column, discussing the current  situation of the National Religious Party [NRP]. The article  says that NRP leader Zvulun Hammer recently held separate  meetings with Likud's David Levi and Ari'el Sharon "in an  attempt to reconciliate between the two," "in a move coordinated  with Likud Chairman Binyamin Netanyahu," hoping to follow this  with "the second stage of setting up the right-wing shadow  government."    After holding the meetings, however, Hammer realized "the  chances of rehabilitating the Likud leadership are slim."  Hammer found that Levi wants to act as foreign minister, and  that Sharon will never be candidate for construction and housing  minister if Tzomet Chairman Refa'el Eytan is promised the  defense portfolio. This further added to the feeling of  frustration the NRP leadership is currently experiencing. It is  frustrated because "its dream of Jewish settlements in the  territories is collapsing, and they can do nothing to stop the  process." The frustration grew even bigger in view of the  "irreversible processes" of the "tightening political  cooperation between Labor and SHAS [Torah Observing Sephardim],  as the latter returns to the coalition, and the socioeconomic  cooperation between SHAS and Meretz" in the Histadrut labor  federation. NRP leaders blame Netanyahu and their cooperation  with the Likud. Party officials last week claimed that only NRP  activists show up for demonstrations against government policies  claiming: "We are their black laborers. Netanyahu comes to our  demonstrations, delivers a speech, and goes home."    The NRP heads expect a shift in the right-wing religious  public sentiment toward them, believing that the Likud, Moledet,  and Tehiya parties will support them in the next elections,  gaining them additional "two or three Knesset seats," but some  NRP leaders believe this will not be enough to get them out of  the opposition. Also, the NRP is in serious financial distress.  "The unexpected Labor defeat in the Histadrut elections will be  followed by the collapse of the secret financial deals between  Histadrut and the NRP," Barzilay says, noting that "the party  still has debts of some 5 million shekels from the local  elections."</p>

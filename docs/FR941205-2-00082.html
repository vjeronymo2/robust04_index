			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Currently, CBOE Rule 17.50(g)(4) provides for a nine month ``lookback period'' for failure to submit accurate trade information. Specifically, the sanction schedule applicable with respect to such violations is graduated so that the sanctions imposed start to increase with the third violation committed during a nine month period and continue to increase with each subsequent violation committed during such nine month period. Under the proposal, the sanction schedule for failure to submit accurate trade information will retain its current structure except that the current nine month ``lookback period'' will be replaced with an eighteen month ``lookback period.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Similarly, the Exchange proposes to amend CBOE Rule 17.50(g)(5), which currently contains no ``lookback period'' for failure to submit trade information to the price reporter, to also provide for an eighteen month ``lookback period.'' As amended, the structure of the ``lookback period'' for failure to submit trade information to the price reporter will be the same as the amended ``lookback period'' for failure to submit accurate trade information. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Exchange believes that the proposed increased ``lookback periods'' will help to sanction recidivists more effectively by increasing the sanctions for repeat violators. In addition, the Division of Market Regulation (``Division'') of the Commission recommended to the Exchange in connection with the Division's 1993 inspection of the Exchange's surveillance, investigative, and enforcement programs that the ``lookback periods'' under CBOE Rule 17.50 be increased, <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  and the proposed ``lookback period'' increases are in accordance with the Exchange's response to the Division concerning the implementation of this recommendation. <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Letter from Brandon Becker, Director, Division, Commission, to Charles Henry, President, CBOE, dated October 20, 1993. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Letter from Charles Henry, President, CBOE, to Brandon Becker, Director, Division, Commission, dated January 14, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The CBOE also proposed to amend Interpretation and Policy .03 to CBOE Rule 17.50 to limit the number of transactions during a particular month for which a member fined more than twice during an 18-month period under CBOE Rule 17.50(g)(4) or (g)(5) may request verification of the fine. Currently, there is no limitation on the number of transactions for which a member may request verification under Interpretation and Policy .03. Under the proposal, if during an 18-month period a member receives three or more fines pursuant to CBOE Rules 17.50(g)(4) or 17.50(g)(5), a limitation would be imposed on the member's ability to request verification of the fines. Specifically, in requesting verification of such fines, the maximum number of transactions during a particular month with respect to which a member could request verification would be limited to the greater of (1) 50 transactions or (2) 10% of the number of transactions deemed not to be in compliance with CBOE Rule 17.50(g)(4) or 17.50(g)(5). The proposed cap would apply separately to fines imposed under CBOE Rules 17.50(g)(4) and 17.50(g)(5). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The CBOE states that in most instances a request for verification involves the review by the Exchange of the hard copies of a member's trading tickets in order to determine whether keypunch errors have occurred in the inputting of the data contained on the tickets. The majority of the requests involve the review of between 30 and 150 transactions, and the number of transactions with respect to which review has been requested by a member has ranged in scope from as little as three transactions to as many as 700 transactions. Since the end of the third quarter of 1993, contemporaneous with an increase in trading volume on the Exchange, the number of fines imposed pursuant to CBOE Rules 17.50(g)(4) and (g)(5) has risen, resulting in a higher number of requests for verification. Consequently, the Exchange has had to devote an increasing amount of staff time and resources to handling these requests. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Exchange believes that the proposed cap is necessary to reduce the amount of staff time and resources which are currently devoted to processing verification requests and to alleviate the current administrative burden associated with responding to these requests. In addition, the Exchange believes that the proposed cap strikes an appropriate balance between not overburdening the Exchange's surveillance staff with the processing of verification requests and leaving in place a meaningful and reasonable opportunity for CBOE members to request verification. Specifically, the Exchange believes that the proposed cap is reasonable based on its analysis that the cap will affect a small percentage of the members requesting verification while at the same time materially reducing the total number of transactions that will need to be reviewed by the Exchange's surveillance staff. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Recruitment: The most sensitive selection tool - Skilful interviewing still offers advantages that more scientific methods of assessment lack Please suppose - unless, of course, you happen to be one - that you are an expert recruitment interviewer. Suppose also that you are vetting two men for a selling job, first A then B, both shown to be suitable by well reputed tests of reasoning and personality, as well as by their claimed experience. In their interviews, they behave as follows: A is impassive, rarely nodding in response to your questions and remarks. He also seems nervous, speaking mostly in a rather high-pitched voice, which occasionally slips into a lower tone that sounds more natural, and several times stumbling over words even though he speaks slowly. B is more genial, frequently smiling, nodding and otherwise showing great interest in what you say, an impression that he strengthens by looking you straight in the eye. His own speech is relaxed and fluent, and he is adept at circumventing potential disagreements. Being an expert interviewer, you know what each of them is probably up to. That much is clear from the research findings set out in the book Successful Selection Interviewing*, whose *Blackwell, Pounds 19.95. lead author is Neil Anderson of Nottingham University. The signs are that both candidates are falling short of total honesty, albeit in different ways. A has the classic marks of the 'deceiver', who is telling lies. B is probably just being economical with the truth. He has the mien of the 'ingratiator' who seeks to make you like him, and so blind yourself to evidence of his faults. In both cases, your expertise enables you to confirm the signs as the interviews proceed. But the important question is what weight you should give to their different types of deviousness in deciding which one to appoint to the job. While inexpert interviewers would be likely to reject both, your professional reading has covered various studies that show that a tendency to be less than wholly honest is a boon in some occupations. Besides politics, they include selling - the type of job you need to fill. Since that applies especially to the sort of deviousness used by B, the odds are that his ingratiating behaviour is a plus. Moreover even the bald lying done by A in the interview doesn't necessarily make him a bad bet. After all, he was depicted as suitable by the psychometric tests, and the well-reputed types of personality test include lie-detectors that research has proved to be highly effective. So the prima facie evidence is that A did not tell lies in his written answers to the test, but changed to distorting the truth only when talking with you face-to-face. And while that in itself is hardly a golden recommendation, it raises questions that you as an expert interviewer will want to explore. For example, did you slip up professionally by doing something early in the meeting that made him decide to lie? If not, did anything happen between the test and your first seeing him that might have had the same effect. . . and so on? All of which illustrates that when it comes to selecting people for jobs, interviewing offers a capability that is increasingly overlooked. As Dr Anderson observes, in their enthusiasm for more modern methods such as psychometric tests, professional recruiters as well as researchers in the field now tend to look down on interviewing as being merely a less reliable method of essentially the same kind. But while that may be so in the case of bad interviewing, it is not true of the skilful sort, which is a different sort of tool. Unlike tests that merely detect human oddity, good interviewers can tease out the reasons behind it. What's more, they can influence an outstanding candidate into joining their company instead of going to work somewhere else. Now to the table alongside, which shows a few of the findings of Day Associates' latest survey of pay and perks in City of London banks. Carried out early last month, it is based on data from 124 employing outfits and includes 307 jobs, high to low. Anyone wanting the full report, priced at Pounds 220, should contact Joe Clark at Suite 2.31, Whitechapel Technology Centre, 75 White-chapel Rd, London E1 1DU; tel (0)71 375 1397, fax (0)71-375 1723. The table's first four columns of figures cover basic salaries. The lower quartile refers to the person a quarter way up from the foot of a ranking of all in the same type of job, the median to the person midway, and the upper quartile to the one a quarter from the top. Then we have the average salary, followed by the percentage of it typically received as an added bonus. Lastly comes something different. Whereas my previous extracts from Day's surveys have given data on company cars, this time I've focused on the car allowances in growing vogue. Even so, the percentages in the upper part of the table are made to look unrealistically high by the fact that the survey samples for the best-paid posts, as well as for the personnel directors' job, are small.</p>

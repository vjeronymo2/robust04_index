			<p><P> December 2, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CAR GOING WRONG WAY ON FREEWAY KILLS MAN;  </P> <P> TRAFFIC: IRVINE CIVIL ENGINEER DIES AND HIS WIFE IS INJURED IN COLLISION ON  INTERSTATE 405 NEAR BRISTOL STREET. THE WRONG-WAY DRIVER ALSO IS HOSPITALIZED.  </P> <P> An Irvine man was killed and two other people critically injured in a fiery  two-car collision triggered by a confused motorist who drove for miles on the  wrong side of the San Diego Freeway, the California Highway Patrol said.  </P> <P> The 4:20 a.m. accident, which CHP officials believe to be alcohol-related,  closed all but one lane of the northbound freeway at the Bristol Street  off-ramp for three hours Saturday, while traffic investigators sorted through  the wreckage, CHP spokeswoman Linda Burrus said.  </P> <P> Sang In Ahn, 50, a civil engineer, was pronounced dead at UCI Medical Center in  Orange after he was airlifted to the hospital's trauma center, Burrus said. His  wife, Ook-Ja Ahn, 47, was listed in extremely critical condition at the same  hospital with fractures and facial injuries.  </P> <P> The driver of the car heading in the wrong direction was identified as Faith L.  Robinson, 23, of Huntington Beach, who was taken to Western Medical  Center-Santa Ana for treatment. She was listed in critical condition with  multiple fractures, including a broken nose and wrist, and other injuries.  </P> <P> "She lost her left eye, and her face was pretty mashed," Burrus said.  </P> <P> Robinson listed her occupation as bartender in 1989 voter registration records.  </P> <P> Burrus said CHP dispatchers began receiving reports of a motorist driving a  dark car the wrong way on the northbound lanes of the freeway as far north as  Westminster. By the time CHP officers were positioned to stop the driver, later  identified as Robinson, the car had passed the Santa Ana riverbed and Fairview  Road.  </P> <P> But before units could reach Robinson's dark-blue, 1983 Buick Regal, it slammed  head-on into Ahn's maroon, 1985 Cadillac Sedan de Ville, Burrus said. Robinson  was the lone occupant in her car.  </P> <P> "We were only a minute away from catching (Robinson)," Burrus said.  </P> <P> The impact was so severe that the Buick exploded in flames, Burrus said. A  passing motorist jumped out of his car and put the flames out with a fire  extinguisher before.  </P> <P> Minutes later, a Toyota pickup truck was unable to stop and struck both mangled  cars, splitting them apart. The driver of the pickup truck, Corey J. Bailey,  16, of Huntington Beach, was not injured.  </P> <P> CHP investigators had initially been unable to determine who had been driving  the wrong way, since witnesses only had sketchy descriptions of the car, Burrus  said. And by the time officers arrived, the cars were so damaged that it was  not clear which had been going the wrong way.  </P> <P> Burrus said that although the investigation is ongoing, it is believed to be  alcohol-related. She did not elaborate.  </P></p>

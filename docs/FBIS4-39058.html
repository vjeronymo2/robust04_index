			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By BUSINESS-TASS correspondent Robert Serebrennikov] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 6 TASS -- "The off-shore zone in  Kalmykia is becoming a reality", declared Kalmyk President  Kirsan Ilyumzhinov in an interview with BUSINESS-TASS on Monday.    The Republic of Kalmykia, possessing lots of potential  resources, is now facing the problem of attracting foreign  investment, the president said. It was decided to make the  creation of an off-shore zone on the republic's territory the  center-piece of its investment programme.    The first step in the realization of this goal was the  Kalmyk  president's decree lowering the republic's tax rates on profit.  The advantageous rates will be available for those enterprises  and businesses which do not use local raw material and financial  resources and which attract outside investment into the  republic. Tax breaks are also planned for banks, insurance  companies, and enterprises, whose capital is 100 per cent  foreign.    This policy brought immediate returns. There are now many  foreign companies, some of them quite large, who are applying to  the Kalmykia mission in Moscow for permission to work in the  off-shore zone. A branch of the republic's registration chamber  has opened in the mission to deal with the applications. There  are already about 100 foreign companies and firms working in  Kalmykia.    Some of the most attractive aspects of the off-shore zone in  Kalmykia are the republic's political stability, the low crime  rate, and the absence of mafia structures.    Ilyumzhinov specially stressed that the off-shore zone in  Kalmykia follows the principle of "environmental economy". This  principle declares that all joint projects with the use of  Russian or foreign capital are carried out only after a strict  assessment of their environmental impact. "I am sure that the  off-shore zone will show its first real results in two years",  the president declared.</p>

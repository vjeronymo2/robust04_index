			<p><P> December 28, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BLUE-COLLAR GOLFER;  </P> <P> ROOKIE PRO PLANS TO TEND TO BUSINESS ON PGA TOUR  </P> <P> Greg Bruckner wheeled the new off-green Honda Accord onto Highland Avenue in  Manhattan Beach. Pink Floyd's song "Money" played over the radio -- ironically,  because Bruckner, a rookie on the Professional Golf Assn. tour, had just spent  the better part of four hours talking about finances when he was supposed to  discuss golf.  </P> <P> In professional golf, conceded the fair-haired, slightly balding Bruckner, it  is difficult to talk about the game without money entering the conversation.  </P> <P> "The PGA is a business," he said. "It's kind of spooky. I haven't really  grasped all of it yet."  </P> <P> Bruckner, 30, would have preferred to talk about the conditions on the public  golf courses in Long Beach, about surfing El Porto or the neighborhood  gatherings at Ercole's Bar in Manhattan Beach every Christmas Eve for the past  25 years. But dollars and sense always crept back into the conversation.  </P> <P> "Living in Manhattan Beach, people might think I grew up wealthy, but I did  not," he said.  </P> <P> He is a working-class golfer, one of the few to grace the PGA tour. And because  he was raised in Southern California, with its reputation for casual  appearances, he said he was singled out at PGA qualifying school by tour  administrators. They told him the Levi's-and-T-shirt image he was accustomed to  while playing in the Asian tour is unacceptable. There will be fines for  inappropriate attire at airports, in hotel lobbies and on golf courses.  </P> <P> "I'm a pretty conservative guy," Bruckner said. "But I come from an atmosphere  where you wear jeans, T-shirts and tennis shoes to go out to dinner."  </P> <P> He must also score well in his first year or run the risk of having to qualify  for his tour card all over again. He qualified this year, after four tries, at  a PGA school in Houston, finishing in a tie for 10th out of 125 competitors.  Only 50 made the cut to the big time.  </P> <P> "They tell me only four rookies finished in the top 125 last year on the tour,"  he said. "That's my goal."  </P> <P> Such raw enthusiasm seems out of place with the stodgy, good-ol'-boy image of  the look-alike golfers seen on nationally televised PGA events.  </P> <P> "It's a gentleman's sport," Bruckner said. "You don't find too many guys on the  pro tour who learned the game on the public courses like I did."  </P> <P> He taught himself, beginning at age 17 at Alondra Park near Lawndale and  Torrance. He and his 6th Street buddies would hang out at the beach all day,  then "play for beers" on the golf course in the late afternoon. For a while,  Bruckner thought that was all there was to life.  </P> <P> "I was a typical kid in Southern California," he said.  </P> <P> A graduate of Mira Costa High School in Manhattan Beach, he eventually made the  El Camino College golf team and went on to play another two years at Arizona  State University while completing a degree in broadcasting.  </P> <P> Bruckner hit the amateur tournament circuits and then, with a $5,000 loan from  his parents, accepted an offer to play on the Asian professional tour, where he  has four victories in four years to his credit.  </P> <P> More important, he scored well consistently half a world away, and his game has  shown steady improvement. He boosted his earnings each year and paid off the  loan to his folks.  </P> <P> "It makes me feel good that I don't owe anyone anything, except to my parents  for supporting me," he said.  </P> <P> His attitude may help him as a pro in this country.  </P> <P> "He has great desire and determination," said Chuck Courtney, a teaching pro at  Rancho Santa Fe Golf Club near San Diego, who has worked with Bruckner. "He  will do well (on the PGA tour). He's a streak putter. If he can get his putter  going, he'll be OK."  </P> <P> Bruckner is a long, straight hitter, according to Courtney, and "a great kid."  If there is such a thing, he said, Bruckner is a self-made professional.  </P> <P> "He started playing the game later than most of the people in the caliber of  play he is in now," Courtney said. "Most kids at 17 who are where he is now  were superstars by that age."  </P> <P> Bruckner has set high goals for 1990.  </P> <P> "I think I can make $200,000 next year," he said while eating a hamburger and  french fries at one of his favorite Manhattan Avenue hangouts.  </P> <P> He doubts that he will have problems handling the pressure -- and the polyester  -- of the PGA tour, which is steeped in genteel traditions rooted in the  American South.  </P> <P> "I'm not out to buck the system," he said. "I just wear casual stuff. . . . I  want to be me as much as I can."  </P> <P> Because of his successes on the Asian tour, Bruckner has socked enough money  away to sponsor himself next year. He typically spends about $25,000 to $30,000  a year on expenses, staying in "medium-level places like La Quintas" when he is  not in Asia. His gross earnings this year were just shy of $100,000.  </P> <P> "I know guys who stay in nice places, and then I've seen guys living out of  cars and showering at their friend's house," he said.  </P> <P> Bruckner is somewhat frugal, he points out. Although he paid cash for it, the  Accord was a splurge. The 1980 four-door Buick Regal he had been driving --  inherited after his grandfather's death -- was on its last legs.  </P> <P> And then there are endorsements. His balls, clubs and shoes are gifts from  sponsors. A clothing deal with a Southern California beachwear company that  wants to bring out a golf line ("something cotton") is in the works.  </P> <P> Telephone calls from potential sponsors have not stopped since he qualified for  the tour.  </P> <P> "I'm nervous, but this could be a very good thing for me," Bruckner said.  </P> <P> Money aside, golf remains a game of numbers.  </P> <P> "If you shoot 68 four times a week all year, then you are going to win," he  said. "You shoot a 73 and you won't win a dime."  </P> <P> A good mental attitude helps, too, Bruckner said. "In golf, you know what  you've got to do, but sometimes preparing to do it is tough."  </P> <P> The Asian tour, ranked No. 4 in importance behind the PGA, Australian and  European tours, has treated Bruckner well, allowing him to play under pressure  on some of the world's most difficult courses and learn to adjust to a variety  of cultures and climates. He has played in foursomes with Asian royalty like  the king of Malaysia and been swarmed after by beggars in the streets of  Calcutta.  </P> <P> Trips to Pakistan and Australia stand out in his mind, as do numerous trips to  his favorite country, Thailand. "It's so different from here," Bruckner said.  </P> <P> But he is a Manhattan Beach homeboy at heart: "There isn't a better place in  the world to live."  </P> <P> Bruckner's favorite practice range is at the El Segundo Golf Course -- a place,  he admits, most of his touring buddies would not lift a putter to. But it suits  him well.  </P> <P> "I don't come from a country club atmosphere," he said.  </P> <P> Bruckner left downtown Manhattan Beach and wound the Accord back to the El  Segundo golf course, where earlier that morning he had paid $5 an hour for a  practice fairway and green. Before lunch he had stood in the shadows of  high-rise buildings and chipped range balls he removed from his own canvas  sack. He wore the public-course player's cold-weather uniform: jeans and sweat  shirt, worn saddle shoes with spikes and a portable stereo with earphones.  </P> <P> An earth mover grunted not far away. Power lines hummed beside the practice  range. The look on Bruckner's face said he was glad to be home.  </P> <P> "Friends ask me, 'Why in the world would you practice here?' " he said. "El  Segundo. It's a dump. But it's my dump."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic by </F> Fausto Biloslavo in Pale; date not given: "Karadzic: `It Will  Be Total War'"]    [Excerpt] Pale -- [passage omitted] Karadzic -- in a blue  suit and sporting an unruly forelock -- started by saying: "The  Gorazde crisis? UNPROFOR (the blue helmet contingent in the  former Yugoslavia -- L'INDIPENDENTE editor's note) is entirely  to blame, because Gorazde was not a safe area, but a Muslim  stronghold which was never demilitarized. In addition, it was  precisely from Gorazde that the Muslims launched a spring  offensive, and we are absolutely determined to deal a blow for a  blow, throughout Bosnia, in response to their attacks. The  international community must cease supporting the Muslims."    [Biloslavo] Will you conquer Gorazde?    [Karadzic] We could do so, but our objective is simply to  demilitarize the town and secure it by defending the area on the  Drina river's right bank, which is traditionally a Serbian area.  As a gesture of goodwill, we have allowed the United Nations to  send about 100 blue helmets (Ukrainian volunteers --  L'INDIPENDENTE editor's note) to the river's left bank, three  kilometers from the town center, in order to protect civilians  only, not the Muslim soldiers.    [Biloslavo] The Serbs are being accused of shelling civilian  targets, and General Rose, UN commander in Bosnia, has defined  Gorazde a humanitarian catastrophe. What is your reply to this?    [Karadzic] You must not believe the Muslim sources, their  amateur radio stations. They often exaggerate the situation in  order to provoke Western intervention. We are trying to  stabilize the cease-fire.    [Biloslavo] What do you think of [UN Secretary General]  Butrus-Ghali requesting NATO to prepare for massive bombing  raids on the Serbs?    [Karadzic] If this request were heeded, this could only mean  war, and we will respond with every means at our disposal. NATO  must be clear about this point, because our soldiers need to  know whether or not the blue helmets are their enemies.    [Biloslavo] Are you prepared to retaliate against Italy too?    [Karadzic] The French, British, and Americans were once our  allies, and we find it difficult to shoot on them. Italy was  our enemy in the last war, but we always had a very good  relationship with the Italian people. Italy would be well  advised to cancel the hospitality that it is giving to NATO  aircraft. If an escalation takes place, a terrible war will  break out. For the time being, we have no intention of  retaliating against your country, although we cannot rule out  anything if the situation gets worse.    [Biloslavo] Why did you recover 18 anti-aircraft weapons  which were supposed to remain under UN control in Sarajevo?    [Karadzic] The Serbs have no intention of passively awaiting  possible air attacks.    [Biloslavo] It looks as though the Russians have also turned  their backs on you. Is this true?    [Karadzic] Moscow envoy Churkin's critical remarks against  us  are due to the tension which has developed over the past few  days. It was an emotional reaction, and we are prepared to  forgive.    [Biloslavo] Will you resume contacts with the UNPROFOR  forces?    [Karadzic] For the moment, contacts are suspended, and they  can only be resumed if the United Nations decide to cancel the  embargo against the Serbs.    [Biloslavo] What do you think of the recent statement by  Bosnian President Izetbegovic, inviting Muslims to fight "in  order to obtain everything or nothing"?    [Karadzic] We have gained our due. In one respect I agree  with the Muslims: They will obtain nothing.</p>

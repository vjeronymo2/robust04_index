			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / Property: London's landlords can smile again - Cadogan's Place Average rents in central London have risen 20 per cent in Mayfair over the past year and 14 per cent in Chelsea, according to agent Knight Frank &amp; Rutley. And there have been fewer British tenants over the past six months - down 29 per cent in Kensington alone, where continental Europeans have shot up 38 per cent. With a shortage of property, prospects for landlords are good. Good one-bedroom flats at Pounds 250 a week and flats with two to three bedrooms at Pounds 500 are in great demand, according to Winkworth Central Lettings; so also are houses at more than Pounds 1,000. The lesson seems to be that if you find what you want, be prepared to agree terms at once; otherwise, you are likely to lose it. * * * The Association of Residential Letting Agents is the professional body for about 40 per cent of the country's letting agents. Its code of practice includes forwarding rent payments promptly and not taking fees from a tenant other than for the inventory and tenancy agreement. Its brochure, What Every Landlord &amp; Tenant Should Ask, is available free from ARLA, in members' offices, and from some Citizens' Advice Bureaux. Send a stamped, addressed envelope to ARLA, 18/21 Jermyn Street, London SW1Y 6HP, or ring 071-734 0655 for members' addresses. Glentree Estates (081-209 1144), an ARLA member specialising in north London, also publishes guides for landlords and tenants. Typically, agents charge landlords 10 per cent of the rent for collection and 15 per cent for full management. Henry &amp; James (071-235 8861), which has a strong list in such top London areas as Belgravia, Chelsea and Knightsbridge, charges a tenant Pounds 65 plus value added tax for a tenancy agreement and the cost of preparing an inventory. The landlord pays for checking it on departure. Meanwhile, if you are letting a flat or house to which you will be returning, it is worth making the effort to get to know the tenants. They will be far more likely to look after the place properly. Do not be mean or greedy over a few pounds when you are receiving hundreds. Be sure to tell your insurance company. For a furnished let, you are likely to find that the underwriters exclude 'mysterious disappearance' of contents and will demand proof of forcible entry if anything is missing. The deposit could go against such losses. But the most effective policy is good relations with the tenant. * * * Fire regulations that came into effect in March last year are proving a little-known trap for landlords. Curtains, covers and upholstery now must pass flammability tests if they are part of a furnished letting 'in the course of a business'. A transitional period allows furniture used in the property before March 1993 to continue in use until December 31 1996, however. The catch seems to be the phrase 'in the course of a business'. That should exclude private, occasional landlords arranging their own lets but, once an agent is involved, the landlord is caught. What are the options? Let it unfurnished - that is already on the increase. Or remove pieces that will not pass the test and let it part-furnished. Or sell the furniture to the tenant.</p>

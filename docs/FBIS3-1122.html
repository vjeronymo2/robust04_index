			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] KwaZulu spokesman Thembinkosi Mmemelo says Friday's  [18 March] proclamation by the Zulu king on the sovereignty of  kwaZulu was not a unilateral declaration of independence. Mr.  Mmelelo said what King Goodwill Zwelithini had proclaimed was  the right of the kingdom of kwaZulu to freely determine its  relationship with the rest of South Africa.    He said King Goodwill had demanded that the kingdom be  recognized as it had existed in 1934. This area included  kwaZulu, Natal, and parts of the eastern Transvaal, and had  extended south to the Umzimvubu River.    The king would probably decide within the next few days on  whether kwaZulu would have federal or international relations  with South Africa. If he chose the latter, it would mean that  the kingdom would become an independent state.</p>

			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Portals says signs of pick-up continuing PORTALS Group, the specialist paper and environmental protection and control products company, reported a 9 per cent rise in 1992 operating profits from continuing operations and said the pick-up in activity seen in the fourth quarter 'has generally been sustained into 1993.' Pre-tax profits, after exceptional items, were little changed at Pounds 25.5m from a restated Pounds 25.2m in 1991. The 1991 figure was originally reported as Pounds 27.6m, but has been restated to comply with the recent FRS 3 reporting standard. Exceptional items under FRS 3 amounted to a net Pounds 1.7m (Pounds 885,000) charge in 1992. The mainly item related to the group's loss-making Airoil-Flaregas subsidiary which was sold in January. Fully diluted earnings per share slipped to 26.74p (28.04p). But an increased final dividend of 9.5p (8.8p) raised the total for the year to 14.5p (13.8p). Despite tough trading conditions operating profits from continuing operations increased to Pounds 28.5m (Pounds 26.3m). Mr Michael Morley, chief executive, said the results were somewhat better than expected because of 'distinct pick-up in the final quarter.' The core security and specialist papermaking division boosted operating profit to Pounds 20.1m (Pounds 19.3m) on sales of Pounds 101m (Pounds 98.2m). The protection and control division increased operating profit by almost 22 per cent to Pounds 8.43m (Pounds 6.93m) on flat turnover of Pounds 77.7m. The sale of the loss-making Airoil-Flaregas subsidiary leaves two core businesses, the Houseman air and water hygiene business, and Computer Technology. Both hold strong positions in their respective key markets. Net borrowings fell by another Pounds 3m last year, despite capital expenditure of Pounds 14.6m (Pounds 12.9m). Year-end borrowings of Pounds 2.8m (Pounds 5.8m) represent gearing of 2 per cent. Since the year end the group has eliminated all of its debt following the Airoil-Flaregas disposal. COMMENT The sale of Airoil-Flaregas means the protection and control division's new management can now focus on building the core businesses. In contrast, growth in the papermaking division is likely to come through acquisition sometime this year. The management has looked at three possibilities in the last 6 months and is sizing-up another two. The key requirements are that the target should be a speciality, high quality niche papermaker in a business where Portals can add value. With no debt a price tag of up to Pounds 50m would not strain the balance sheet unduly. Pre-tax profits this year could reach Pounds 30m, producing earnings of about 31.5p. The prospective p/e of 16.2 reflects growth and takeover potential.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [ITAR-TASS report under "From Our Correspondents and News </F> Agencies" rubric: "Kirghizia [Kyrgyzstan] Has 25 Generals for  15,000 Servicemen"]    [Text] Exercises by the Armed Forces of Kirghizia held  the other day were marked by a shower of stars on commanders'  shoulder boards.    By an edict of President Askar Akayev, four Kirghizian Army  officers were simultaneously promoted to the rank of major  general. Competent sources in the Defense Ministry claim that  the Republic, whose Armed Forces number barely 15,000, now has  22 serving majors general and three lieutenants general. True,  the actual commander in chief, President Akayev, holds the  modest rank of reserve colonel.</p>

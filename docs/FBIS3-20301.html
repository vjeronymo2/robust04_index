			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Kassel (DPA) -- Nine months after its founding  in Hamburg the Instead Party set its course for the super  election year 1994 over the weekend [26-27 March]. At the first  federal congress in Kassel delegates from six laender elected a  Federal Executive Committee and decided to participate in the  European elections on 12 June. However, the precondition for  the definite participation in the European elections is the  founding of associations in most laender by 12 May. The party  congress elected Bernd Schoenemann, a 49-year-old criminal-law  professor from Munich, as new federal chairman. Last June the  Instead Party was founded by ex-Christian Democratic Union rebel  Markus Wegner in Hamburg and is represented in the land  government there.    During a discussion on Sunday, which lasted for four hours,  Baden-Wuerttemberg, Bavaria, and Thuringia called for  participating in the European elections, while representatives  from Hamburg, Schleswig-Holstein, and Hesse came out against it.  [passage omitted]    The federal congress has not yet agreed on new guidelines  for  federal policy but has taken over the principles of the Hamburg  mother party for the time being. These principles proclaim the  introduction of plebiscitary elements, the slimming down of  parliaments, the abolition of mandatory party vote, and more  business-like instead of ideology-oriented policy. Mike  Bashford, Juergen Pilligrath, Sabine Winter, Bernhard  Engelbrecht, and six assessors from the land associations were  elected to the Executive Committee in addition to Schoenemann.  The next founding of associations of the Instead Party, which  has about 2,500 members all over Germany, is supposed to take  place in Berlin on 23 April and in North Rhine-Westphalia at the  beginning of May.</p>

			<p><P> April 7, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> TORREY PINES HOPING TO LAND NEW COACH AND STAR QUARTERBACK  </P> <P> The Palomar League is undergoing a small shake-up, but of all the new faces in  the North County, the most notable could be a quarterback who would move to the  area if Bob Davis accepts the head football coaching position at Torrey Pines  High School.  </P> <P> Davis, defensive coordinator at Palm Springs High, would bring with him son  Chad, a 6-foot-2, 170-pound junior-to-be who is on a pace to break Todd  Marinovich's national record of 9,182 yards passing set at Capistrano Valley.  </P> <P> Marinovich is now at USC. Davis has thrown for 4,766 yards in two years.  </P> <P> Bob Davis was offered the Torrey Pines position on Thursday. He has an 85-56  record in five previous head coaching positions.  </P> <P> The offer to Davis came one day after San Dieguito, the other high school in  the district, named Marty Albert of Los Alamos, N.M., as its head football  coach. Albert replaced Dave Rudolph, who accepted the position in early March  but resigned Monday for financial reasons involving the district's health  benefits package.  </P> <P> Elsewhere in the league, Mt. Carmel, which has the county's largest student  enrollment, named Frank Andruski as its athletic director, a position that  becomes effective after June graduation. He will replace Bob Speights, who will  become an assistant principal at Rancho Bernardo High School, which opens in  the fall.  </P> <P> Andruski was also the athletic director from 1980-84.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Central Committee of the Trade Union of  Communication Workers of Russia has sent a letter to Viktor  Chernomyrdin, Aleksandr Yakovlev, and the communications  minister, which says that the protracted financial crisis at  communication enterprises responsible for the broadcasting of  state radio and television programs is far from being solved.    Repeated written requests from the Finance Ministry for the  debts to radio enterprises to be repaid remain nothing but  scraps of paper. As a result of the communication enterprises'  inability to pay for electricity and other materials, radio  centers in Kamchatka, Kalinigrad and other areas have been cut  off. Most of Russia's radio and television enterprises are on  the verge of stoppage.    Unless the demands of communication workers are met, from 10  February only the transmission of morning and evening  information programs from Ostankino and the All-Russian State  Radio and Television Company will be provided.</p>

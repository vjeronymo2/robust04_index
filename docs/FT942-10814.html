			<p>940509 FT  09 MAY 94 / People: Reinshagen - from fine art to UBS boardroom Staid old Union Bank of Switzerland will have to go some way to provide Maria Reinshagen, one of two women it has just elected to its board, with the kind of thrills she has known in the fine art business, Ian Rodger in Zurich. Reinshagen, deputy chairman of the Swiss subsidiary of Christie's International, was the underbidder for Van Gogh's Portrait du Dr Gachet in May 1990 when Ryoei Saito, a Japanese paper magnate, won it with a Dollars 75m bid. With the 10 per cent commission, the Dollars 82.5m is still the highest price ever paid for a painting. 'By the end, my heart was about to jump out of my body,' recalled Reinshagen last week of the feverish bidding. Described by Christie's chairman Sir Anthony Tennant as the group's number one business getter, she says she throws herself fully into everything she does. She studied violin as a child and played in professional orchestras in Switzerland and the US in the 1960s. But she gave it up in 1966 when the first of her two children was born. A school teacher by training, she started in the art business in Zurich in 1961, working in galleries there and in Los Angeles until setting up a Zurich outlet for Christie's in 1978. Inevitably, both she and Anne-Lise Monnier, the other woman joining the UBS board, have been labelled token women. Reinshagen, who did not even campaign for women's voting rights in Switzerland in 1971, says she is apolitical and has never had problems working alongside men. She has, however, fought vigorously to reform the country's perverse primary school hours, which are deliberately designed to trap mothers at home. She joins the UBS board at a potentially exciting time. Her election was in doubt till the end because of a motion by activist shareholder BK Vision at the recent AGM to slash the board's membership from 23 to nine. The motion was defeated, but the 40 per cent support for BK and its intense chairman Martin Ebner showed that the bank's directors will have to pay much more attention to shareholder interests than they have in the past. Reinshagen suggests that Ebner erred only in pushing the issue in the year when UBS finally invited two women to join, and in fixing on nine. 'By coincidence, nine is my favourite number, but for such a large bank, it is too low a figure.'</p>

			<p>940829 FT  29 AUG 94 / International Company News: Austrian insurer in 1m share debut Wiener Stadtische Allgemeine Versicherung, Austria's largest insurance company, is coming to the Vienna stock exchange in October with an initial issue of 1m new preference shares. The Sch100 par value shares would represent just under one-tenth of the group's existing Sch1.1bn (Dollars 95.6m) nominal capital. Wiener Stadtische is 91 per cent controlled by a mutual society backed by the City of Vienna. Bank Austria, which is also controlled indirectly by the City of Vienna, has 8 per cent. The all risk insurer had premium income last year of Sch15.4bn, giving it a 13 per cent share of the Austrian market. Net income, calculated on the Austrian financial analysts' method (OVFA), jumped to Sch852m from Sch625m in 1992. Its capital at the year-end stood at Sch6.2bn. In the first half of 1994, its premium income advanced 4 per cent to Sch8.5bn, and it is forecasting a 2 per cent rise in the full year to Sch15.8bn. OVFA net income is forecast to ease to Sch827m. Wiener Stadtische also leads a group of Austrian insurance companies which has a combined annual premium income of Sch23.6bn and claims a market share of about 20 per cent. The preference shares will be entitled to a minimum 15 per cent dividend with a guarantee to exceed the ordinary dividend by 5 per cent for three years. The ordinary dividend for the past two years has been 15 per cent. Bank Austria, lead manager of the issue, plans to announce the price of the shares on September 30. The subscription period is from October 3 to 7.</p>

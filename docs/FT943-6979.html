			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: FT-SE races ahead to close at five-month high - Market report A burst of heavy buying interest from the US and throughout Europe just before the close of trading, drove the FT-SE 100 index decisively through the 3,200 level. FT-SE 3,200 has proved a stumbling block to the market in recent sessions, with the index pushing through that level many times only to drop back sharply. The buying was mainly through the FT-SE future and was said to have been generated by strong buying and arbitraging by two leading integrated houses, one US and the other UK. At the close the FT-SE 100 was 30.1 higher at 3,205.2, the first time it has closed above 3,200 since March 22. Buying interest was concentrated in the market leaders, however, with the FT-SE Mid 250 index, which contains many of the outperforming utilities stocks, able to record a modest 8.7 rise at 3,762.1. Some traders attributed the burst of support to the excercising of a specially constructed FT-SE stock option at the 3,200 level, a move which led to a rush of short covering and arbitraging in both the future and cash markets. Market strategists preferred to ascribe the upturn in the market to a decoupling of European equity markets from international bonds. It was noticeable that bonds endured difficult trading for much of yesterday with German bunds unsettled by evidence of increasing inflation in western regions of Germany. Inflation in Baden Wurtenburg rose 0.2 per cent in the month to mid-August, giving a year-on-year increase of 3.1 per cent while in North Rhine Westphalia inflation was 0.1 per cent higher on the month and up 2.8 per cent on the year. Analysts were concerned that evidence of rising inflation could demolish any hopes of a cut in German interest rates next week when the Bundesbank Council meets to discuss monetary policy. UK gilts closed little changed on the session. The market's last-minute advance built on earlier modest gains in equities. The 100 index began the session quietly firm, up over seven points, responding to Wall Street's good overnight performance which in turn was a reflection of the encouraging outcome of the auction Dollars 17bn worth of two year bonds. European markets received a further boost from the US where the Dow Jones was more than 20 points higher shortly after the opening, following a fall in US durable goods orders. The US news was interpreted as indicating a slowing of the US economy and produced a rise in US bonds. The buying spree produced another useful increase in the volume of business in London. Turnover reached 701.6m shares, well up on Tuesday's 556.5m and Monday's 499m. The value of customer business in London on Tuesday was Pounds 1.3bn. News that Seeboard had purchased 2m of its own shares late on Tuesday was the trigger for yet another burst of strength in the regional electricity stocks which have spiralled upwards both before and following the electricity distribution pricing review last month. All the 12 electricity companies have shareholder permission to buy their own shares and the market is also braced to expect a burst of stakebuilding and or takeover activity possibly even ahead of the removal of the Government's 'golden shares' which will be withdrawn next March. It was also pointed out that several institutions are still underweight in the Recs and waiting for an expected bout of profit-taking in the sector. Composite insurers delivered good rises across the board with traders noting the sector's underperformance for much of the year. And there were keen buyers in the market for Lloyds Bank and HSBC. Takeover stories remained the dominant factor in a buoyant drugs sector where Glaxo, Zeneca and Wellcome all made significant progress.</p>

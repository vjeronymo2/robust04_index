			<p>920530 FT  30 MAY 92 / Canary Wharf: Tube deal 'is not binding' NO PROSPECTIVE developer or the administrators of Canary Wharf can be bound to the commitment undertaken by Olympia &amp; York to provide Pounds 400m towards the extension of the London Underground Jubilee Line, the Department of Transport said yesterday. No formal agreement that would be legally binding had been signed, the department said, although it had received a letter of intent from O&amp;Y setting out the terms of its contribution. In the absence of a formal agreement, it was clear that no one could be bound to honour O&amp;Y's commitment, the department said, but that did not change the government's position. Unless the future owners of Canary Wharf were prepared to make the same contribution, the government's commitment of Pounds 1.5bn to the Underground project would not be forthcoming. Lawyers close to the insolvency said yesterday that even if O&amp;Y had signed a formal agreement it would not have been binding on the administrators. A partner in a City law firm said the function of an administrator was to preserve the assets of a business and he could not be forced to honour contracts that involved him in spending money. The administrators were therefore free to sell and let the properties regardless of O&amp;Y's commitment to the Jubilee extension, he added. Mr Stephen Adamson, one of the three joint administrators, has said he will look at the option of finding finance for the extension, but that Canary Wharf could survive without it. The future of the extension now depends either on a change of heart by the government or a decision to contribute by new owners of Canary Wharf.</p>

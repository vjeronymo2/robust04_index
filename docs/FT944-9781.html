			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Barclays sells US credit arm at Dollars 290m premium Barclays has reached agreement to sell its asset-based lending business in the US for a premium of Dollars 290m (Pounds 177m) over its book value, a price which reflects the company's strong track record. The sale of Barclays Business Credit, which is expected to be completed early next year, is the latest in a series of disposals intended to leave the UK banking group with a focus on investment banking business in the US. The company, which had receivables of Dollars 2.1bn at the end of September and 15 offices around the US, is being bought by Shawmut, the New England-based banking group. Barclays Business Credit, which made profits of Dollars 67.5m before tax last year and Dollars 58.1m in the nine months to end-September, had net assets of Dollars 213.7m at the end of last year. The price paid by Shawmut represents a substantial multiple of this 1993 book value, reflecting the highly profitable nature of its business. However, Mr Joel Balvard, the US bank's chairman and chief executive, said the deal was 'financially attractive and immediately accretive to earnings per share' for Shawmut. The credit company, which has 300 employees, originates and syndicates loans of between Dollars 5m and Dollars 150m to medium-sized companies. It had been part of Aetna, the US insurance group before Barclays bought it in 1980. The sale will result in a pre-tax profit to Barclays of Dollars 271m.</p>

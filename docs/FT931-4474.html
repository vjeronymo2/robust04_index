			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / Germany 'needs pact to stave off deeper recession' URGENT agreement on the planned solidarity pact to finance the future cost of German unification is needed in the coming days, to prevent a worsening of the economic recession, Mr Gunter Rexrodt, the German economy minister, urged yesterday. In spite of continuing deep differences between the German government and opposition, and between the central government and the 16 federal states, on ways of financing the cost of unification, he expressed confidence that a deal on the pact was close. In an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Rexrodt said that such an agreement would be a 'great breakthrough', amounting to a major reform of public finances, and a long-term guarantee of the cash transfers needed to finance economic recovery in east Germany. Speaking on the eve of a two-day closed-doors conference between Chancellor Helmut Kohl and the 16 premiers of the federal states, as well as the leaders of the main parliamentary parties, Mr Rexrodt said he believed the political conditions were right for a deal. 'People have started to say they don't care about the details, whether it means a 13 pfennig increase in petrol tax, or an 18 pfennig increase. They have had enough talking, and they want a solution. That makes me hopeful,' he said. Speaking in the German Bundestag earlier, Mr Rexrodt said international financial markets were expecting an agreement, and it was essential to avoid a further slide into recession. Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister and principal architect of the government's package of social spending cuts and cancelled tax breaks intended to finance increased spending in the east, rejected calls from the opposition Social Democrats for an early tax rise. He insisted the federal government and the 16 states must share the burden of financing unification, rather than switch almost the entire burden onto the central exchequer. Mr Hans-Ulrich Klose, leader of the SPD in the parliament, restated the demand of the opposition that a solidarity surcharge on income tax should be reintroduced in July to meet the financing gap, and flatly rejected any move to cut social spending.

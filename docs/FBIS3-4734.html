The  inspections are expected to take about two weeks.    The team members, led by Olli Heinonen, left Beijing earlier  in the day, where they arrived on Monday from Vienna. North  Korea agreed to the inspections by the International Atomic  Energy Agency (IAEA) on Friday in New York at a working-level  meeting with U.S. Officials.    North Korea allowed six inspections of its declared nuclear  sites in 1992, but threatened to pull out of the Nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty last March when pressed to allow checks  of two undeclared facilities suspected of being related to a  clandestine nuclear arms development program. Inspections of  the six declared facilities in the Yongbyon nuclear complex,  some 90 kilometers north of Pyongyang, and one site at Kim  Il-song University in the North Korean capital are expected to  get under way Wednesday. The inspections, however, will not  include the two undeclared sites suspected of being nuclear  waste storage facilities that could reveal the nature of the  North Korean nuclear program.    IAEA inspectors have said that to make the checks meaningful  they would have to examine the nuclear fuel rods to determine if  plutonium, which could be used in the manufacture of an atomic  arsenal, had been extracted.    The issue of inspecting the two undeclared sites at Yongbyon  and examining the nuclear fuel rods has been left to the next  round of high-level talks between Washington and Pyongyang,  which according to North Korean officials is scheduled for March  21 in Geneva.    Meanwhile, Pyongyang rejected a South Korean request on  Tuesday to reopen the inter-Korean dialogue, proposing instead  to meet Thursday at the border truce village of Panmunjom. In  response to the delay, the South Korean Government held off its  decision to cancel the "Team Spirit" U.S.-South Korea joint  military exercises.    Reopening the inter-Korean dialogue and calling off the  military exercises had been half of a four-item agreement  reached February 25 in a working-level meeting in New York  between U.S. and North Korean representatives. The agreement  had been reached to ensure IAEA inspectors access to the North  Korean facilities.    Although Pyongyang had agreed with the IAEA on February 15  to  permit the checks, it held back issuing the necessary visas to  the inspection team and demanded that a date be set for a third  round of high-level talks with the U.S.    Following the meeting in New York, North Korean  representatives said that the third round would open March 21 in  Geneva, but Washington is insisting that Seoul-Pyongyang talks  on the exchange of special envoys be initiated first. North and  South have agreed to make the Korean peninsula nuclear- free,  but North Korea has insisted that the issue can only be resolved  through a bilateral dialogue with Washington.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Natalya Pachegina report under the "In Brief" rubric: </F> "Hostages Released"]    [Text] According to a report from Nazran, on 12 April  Vladimir Lozovoy, chief of the Provisional Administration on the  territory of North Ossetia and Ingushetia, who left for the site  of an incident -- Vladikavkaz's Promyshlennyy District (which is  located outside the state of emergency area and to which the  authority of the Provisional Administration chief, consequently,  does not apply) -- involving a motorcade from Ingushetia, was  injured in a clash with an agitated mob. Neither the  Provisional Administration chief's press center in Vladikavkaz  nor the North Ossetian authorities have confirmed this  information. [Moscow KOMMERSANT-DAILY in Russian on 14 April,  page 14, in a Mikhail Lashch report on the incident, adds:  "After Vladimir Lozovoy and his deputy, General Shapovalov, came  to the site of the incident, people in the crowd who were not  permitting the buses through started throwing stones at them.  General Georgiy Kantemirov, North Ossetia internal affairs  minister, who was present there, did not intervene in the  proceedings. Mr. Lozovoy sustained a slight injury."] On the  contrary, it has transpired there that a Russian military unit  was blocked in Nazran. As for Ingush hostages who, according to  reports from Nazran, were held by an Ossetian special purpose  military unit, Vladikavkaz has said that all Ingush citizens  were released by the evening of 12 April. This matter was  attended to personally by Soslan Sikoyev, commandant of the  North Ossetian capital. Meanwhile, the presidents of both  republics, who have scheduled a meeting for 15 April in Nalchik,  have confirmed their readiness to continue talks. Earlier,  groups of experts left the North Ossetian and Ingush capitals  for Kabardino-Balkaria to make preparations for the presidents'  summit.</p>

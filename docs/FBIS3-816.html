			<p>Language: <F P=105> Afrikaans </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Chairman of the Conservative Party [CP] in the Cape  Province and MP for Kuruman, Mr. Jan Hoon, denied in a statement  that he supported General Constand Viljoen. He said he is still  committed to the National Front and to the CP Executive  Committee's decision not to participate in the election. Mr.  Hoon said Mr. Viljoen had recently made statements with which he  could not identify. One of them was that 85 percent of his  fatherland will fall under an ANC [African National Congress]  government.    Another development is that CP MP for Lydenburg, Mr. Dries  Bruwer, has announced his resignation from politics. He had  been the CP's spokesman on agriculture. Mr. Bruwer had also  been chairman of the Transvaal Agricultural Union.</p>

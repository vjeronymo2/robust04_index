			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / FT Guide to Personal Equity Plans - What the experts say (8): Peps need thought - do you want growth, income or total return? / A decision taken in haste is liable to be regretted later. On these pages we invite three financial advisers each to suggest plans and providers, to meet three types of requirement People tend to leave tax-planning to the last minute. One of the disadvantages of leaving things too late is that you have less time in which to choose from the myriad Peps available. A snap decision could be one that you come to regret, writes Scheherazade Daneshkhu. Some investors may want the Pep to pay off the mortgage; others may want it primarily for income; while younger investors may feel in a position to be more speculative with their Pep investment. It is therefore a good idea to take independent, preferably fee-based, financial advice before choosing. We asked three experts to select three different types of Pep to meet the varying needs. One is for income, one for aggressive capital growth, and one for more conservative growth or total return. Robert Noble-Warren, of advisers Murray Noble, says: 'We prefer to buy self-select Peps, because we find the charges are lower.' He favours self-select Peps at two stockbrokers: Charles Stanley, with an initial charge of Pounds 29, and an annual 0.75 per cent fee; and Pilling &amp; Co, which has no initial or annual charge, but levies Pounds 6.75 per dividend payment. The strategy underpinning Noble Warren's Pep selection is that there are better returns on deposit, in fixed interest and emerging markets than in the developed markets of the US, UK and Japan. CONSERVATIVE GROWTH: 'A large proportion of the Pep - 40 per cent - would be invested in cash, to obtain 5 per cent gross interest,' says Noble-Warren. Although the Inland Revenue would view unfavourably Peps used with the intention of sheltering cash, it is possible to switch into cash before buying equities without Revenue disapproval. About half the Pep would be invested in the zero-dividend preference shares of investment trusts. 'Care is needed in selecting zeros, because you need to match the redemption date to the cash need of the investor. Otherwise, when interest rates rise and the investor tries to encash, there will be a loss of capital.' Noble-Warren likes the zeros of Olim and Finsbury Smaller Companies. 'I've chosen Olim, even though the cover is relatively low at above one times covered, because of its excellent long-term performance; while Finsbury Smaller Companies zero is one of the safest around, and is more than two times covered. 'I would put the 10 per cent balance of the Pep into two emerging markets investment trusts. Foreign &amp; Colonial is one of the most reputable names in the business. The other fund is Latin American Trust, because, within emerging markets, I prefer exposure to Latin America rather than the Far East. With the North America Free Trade Agreement in place, Latin America should benefit from exposure to the US market.' AGGRESSIVE GROWTH: 'No cash in this one. Instead, 50 per cent in the same zeros as for the conservative growth Pep. I think the UK market is going to be less risky than the US, so another 25 per cent would go into UK equities through Fidelity's Special Situations unit trust, which has shown consistently good performance. I'd put 10 per cent in the Latin American Trust and, for a wider spread of emerging markets, another 15 per cent in Gartmore Emerging Pacific.' INCOME: Cash once again plays an important part in the income Pep. Noble-Warren says he would hold half in cash and the rest in the income shares of spilt-capital investment trusts. 'I would invest 40 per cent in New Throgmorton income shares, which are yielding about 9 per cent, or in River and Mercantile. The remaining 10 per cent would go into M&amp;G's Second Dual Income shares, which are yielding 20 per cent. This level of yield is often at the expense of capital but the income is very worthwhile.' Andrew Teasdale, of Shepherd Associates, bemoans the fact that the end of the tax year prompts Pep investment regardless of the state of the market. 'Tax should never be the principal factor in investment timing,' he says. 'For many investors, it would be safer to invest on a monthly basis through a savings scheme, even if this means forgoing some of this year's Pep allowance.' He advises investors to avoid fund managers that make an additional charge for their Pep. CONSERVATIVE GROWTH: 'For the investor who wants total return without above-average risk, I would recommend an index-fund Pep, such as the James Capel or Morgan Grenfell UK index funds. Schroder UK Equity is also a possibility, while the comparable European fund would be Baring European Growth. If the investor wants balanced growth, M&amp;G General, Gartmore British Growth, Fidelity UK Growth, M&amp;G European and General and Henderson European are all good funds.' AGGRESSIVE GROWTH: 'The investor who wants a potentially higher return, with a higher level of risk, should choose a fund with a higher allocation to smaller and medium-sized companies. Here, I would recommend M&amp;G Recovery, Fidelity Special Situations or Edinburgh Smaller Companies. For international exposure, the investor can choose between Perpetual Growth and Scottish Mortgage Investment Trust. Many of the competitive investment trusts - for example, Foreign &amp; Colonial  - either do not have a Pep link or limit investment to a maximum of Pounds 1,500.' INCOME: 'I do not favour high-income products for Pep investments, due to the lack of control over the rate of potential capital depreciation. The bottom of an interest-rate and the top of a market cycle is the wrong time to go chasing income. My recommendations are M&amp;G Dividend, Schroder Income, Morgan Grenfell UK Equity Income. European choices would include M&amp;G European Dividend and Fidelity European Income. 'If the investor wants a higher-risk, higher-return income portfolio, he or she can consider Perpetual Income/High Income, Credit Suisse Income, M&amp;G Equity Income and GT Smaller Companies Dividend and Martin Currie International Income fund. James Higgins, of Chamberlain de Broe, makes the following choices: CONSERVATIVE GROWTH: 'This category is a bit of a catch-all, but the fund that I think offers the best value and potential growth is the Alliance Trust Pep. Alliance Trust itself is one of the biggest and most successful international investment trusts. It is too widely invested, though, and does not fully qualify as a Pep investment. 'So, while the first Pounds 1,500 can go into the Alliance and/or second Alliance trusts, the balance of your money can go into a wide range of alternative investment trusts, including Edinburgh, Scottish Mortgage, Witan, Law Debenture and Electric &amp; General. This is a very attractive list of alternatives. 'The charges are minimal (dealing charges of up to 0.25 per cent) so this plan is very cost-effective. The drawback is that they can only deal during limited periods of the month: but as these are long-term investments, this is not actually a problem.' AGGRESSIVE GROWTH: 'My recommendation at the moment is the newly-launched Mercury European Privatisation trust. The public offer closes on March 2. Not only should this have merit as a long-term European blue chip investment fund, but it will be possible, in the opening 42-day period, to renounce the warrants into a Pep as well as the ordinary shares. If the fund performs, these warrants will have the effect of greatly gearing up the capital return. 'I would recommend using a self-select Pep (which does not carry an annual percentage charge) such as Killik's for the exercise, because Mercury will have an annual Pep manager's charge of 1 per cent plus VAT on top of the underlying trust's charge. Killik &amp; Co will charge their usual dealing charge of 1.65 per cent (minimum Pounds 40) for the renunciation, and then Pounds 7.50 for each dividend to reclaim tax.' INCOME: 'When looking for income from equity-based collective funds, one has to work from the start-point of the yield on FT-SE 100 or the All-Share - not much more than 3 per cent. Yields can be increased by greater exposure to riskier smaller companies, or by the use of bonds or convertibles. These are fairly straightforward investments, which do not involve much in the way of gearing. 'Then there are the hybrids, such as Hypo F&amp;C's high-income Pep, in which there is a danger that capital will be eroded. The new James Capel 'generator' unit trust Pep is an interesting departure - it offers a pay-out (not income) of 5 per cent or 7.5 per cent, which explicitly adds capital to yield to generate an overall return. 'As long as the investor is fully aware that they are simply taking capital back as the 'income', and as long as this pay-out does not continue to be taken during a period of falling equity prices, then this vehicle should prove popular. 'In the past, we have been enthusiasts about the income shares of split-capital investment trusts within self-select Peps. The very high yield maximises the tax efficiency of the investment and makes greatest use of the Pep vehicle. 'However, these investments are more volatile than ordinary shares of investment trusts or unit trusts, because of the way they gear up the income on the portfolio. At the moment, because of potential volatility in the equity markets, I would be happier to invest in a straight trust that offers a reasonably high yield, such as Morgan Grenfell's Equity Income investment trust (or its unit trust sister). Other contenders are Newton's and GT's income unit trusts.'</p>

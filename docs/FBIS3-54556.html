Thus, for example, Itamar Rabinovich and Muwaffaq al-'Allaf  briefly touched on the issue of principles of security on the  Golan Heights. Rabinovich suggested that the two men discuss the  issue as though an Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights had  already been decided upon. The Syrian negotiator did not rule  out the proposal but has so far refused to hold an open and  detailed debate on the issue.    Meanwhile, the talks on the Syrian, Lebanese, and  Palestinian  tracks are being conducted between the heads of the delegations.  It remains unclear whether the expanded delegations will meet  next week.    In the meantime, not only King Husayn but also Shaykh Hamad  Bin-Jasim, the Qatari foreign minister, took some brave steps  toward reconciliation with Israel. He admitted tonight that  Qatar was holding trade negotiations with Israel on a large gas  deal; however, the foreign minister clearly explained to us this  evening that a signed agreement was still a long way off.    [Begin Bin-Jasim recording, in English] When we see some  advance in the negotiations with Syria and Lebanon, we will take  our own action with the second and the third boycott. And about  the first boycott, it will have to be taken through the Arab  league. [end recording]    The minister promised that the Israelis arriving in Qatar  for  the multilateral talks in April would receive a warm welcome.    [Begin Bin-Jasim recording, in English] And I think our  people will accept our move and they will even defend the case  by themselves. [end recording]    The heads of the Syrian and Israeli delegations have also  agreed about the definition of the proposed demilitarization of  the Golan Heights. This will be a balanced demilitarization  that will not obligate Israel to demilitarize large areas of the  Galilee in exchange for the demilitarization of the Golan  Heights.</p>

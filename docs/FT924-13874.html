			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Kunick sells 50% of nursing homes Shares in Kunick gained  3/4 p to 5p yesterday after the company announced it was selling a 50 per cent stake in its nursing homes business to reduce borrowings. County NatWest Ventures will pay Pounds 12.5m for a stake in Goldsborough Holdings, a new holding company for the nursing homes business. About Pounds 18m of Kunick borrowings will be transferred to the new holding company. A further Pounds 6m of bank borrowings will be repaid once certain Goldsborough properties are sold. This will reduce Kunick's net borrowings from Pounds 46m at March 31 to about Pounds 10.5m. He said Kunick intended to keep its stake in Goldsborough, which may be floated at a later stage. The nursing home business has been burdened by heavy borrowings, and recorded a pre-tax loss of Pounds 900,000 in the year to December 31. Kunick's two French nursing homes are not part of the deal and are being retained.</p>

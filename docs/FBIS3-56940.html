The spokesman, Grigoriy Karasin, told reporters that the  declaration could not only help stabilize Serb-Croat relations,  but also have a positive effect on resolving the problem of  Krajina (the state created by Serbs within the boundaries of the  former Yugoslav republic of Croatia).    The foreign ministers of Yugoslavia and Croatia, Vladislav  Jovanovic and Mate Granic, signed in Geneva on Wednesday a  statement on the normalization of mutual relations and opening  of representative offices in Belgrade and Zagreb on February 15.    Belgrade said on Thursday the statement did not imply mutual  recognition and establishment of diplomatic ties between the two  states and did not prejudge a solution to the problem existing  between Croatia and the U.N.-protected Republic of Serb Krajina.</p>

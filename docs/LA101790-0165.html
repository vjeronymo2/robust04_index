			<p><P> October 17, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> COLTS TAKE DICKERSON BACK INTO THE FOLD  </P> <P> Most of the Indianapolis Colts have accepted Eric Dickerson's return to the  team. Now they want him to contribute to a team that may be on the rebound.  </P> <P> Dickerson suited up Tuesday and took his first hits since last season -- one of  them a "stunner" -- as the Colts practiced for Sunday's game with Denver. He  was suspended for six weeks in the latest chapter in a nearly yearlong dispute  with team management.  </P> <P> Quarterback Jack Trudeau, who has led the Colts to two comeback victories after  the team lost its first three games, said the controversy and Dickerson's  return shouldn't be a distraction.  </P> <P> "I don't think anybody hated Eric," Trudeau said. "Everybody will put it behind  them and give Eric a chance to make up for the things that happened. If he  plays well, he can certainly help us."  </P> <P> Running back Albert Bentley, who took Dickerson's place in the backfield, said  he always knew there was a chance Dickerson would return.  </P> <P> "Most of the guys have accepted Eric back," Bentley said. "It's something we're  all going to have to do."  </P> <P> Dickerson, for his part, said he sensed no tension or bitterness from the  teammates he once trashed. But some of the offensive linemen, who took  Dickerson's harshest criticism, weren't talking to him.  </P> <P> "I wasn't nervous at all," Dickerson said. "Everyone thinks I have all these  enemies . . . There are three or four guys I don't get along with, but there's  45 or so others. Everyone thinks I'm a hated guy around here, but I have my  friends."  </P> <P> The Colts suspended Dickerson for conduct detrimental to the team and put him  on the injured list in late August when he refused five times to take a  physical to check the status of a hamstring injury he suffered in the  off-season. Dickerson spent the last six weeks on the NFL's non-football  injured list.  </P> <P> "This is my life. I lead my life the way I see fit. Sometimes it turns out  wrong," Dickerson said. "I know some of the things I said were wrong, some of  the things I did were wrong, and I apologize. The only way I know how is to say  'I'm sorry.' I don't know how else I can say it."  </P> <P> Dickerson who needs 11 yards to pass O. J. Simpson for sixth place among NFL  rushing leaders, said he expects to be booed Sunday, but wants to put the  controversy behind him.  </P></p>

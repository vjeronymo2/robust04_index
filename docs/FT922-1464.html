			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / Survey on A-Z of Computing (19): Functions the price paid for performance - Risc AN ACRONYM derived from the term 'reduced-instruction set computer', a Risc is a special type of microprocessor offering high performance at the expense of functions. Risc microprocessors provide a limited number of so-called 'primitive' operations, which give the best possible performance. They have become established as the engines of the new wave of workstation computers from companies such as Sun Microsystems and the Hewlett Packard-owned Apollo. They are also being used increasingly by hardware manufacturers as the basis for new ranges of computers. Although the idea of Risc has existed since the beginnings of computing, the first serious attempt to create a computer based on the principle goes back to the early 1970s when IBM's Thomas Watson Research Center in the US set up a team to build one. It was called the 801 and was the forerunner of IBM's RS/6000, its current range of Risc workstation systems. Simultaneously, researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, and Stanford University were developing Risc machines. This research led to the development of Risc-based products by Sun Microsystems and MIPS Computer. Although these Risc processors work slightly differently, they are all based on the same principle - that a smaller repertoire of functions can deliver higher performance. Computers are built from two basic semiconductor components or chips: memory and processor. Memory chips are used for storing data and program instructions. Processor chips are used to execute the program instructions. Traditional processor chips - sometimes referred to as 'complex-instruction set computers' (Cisc) - provide a wide range of instruction functions to move data around memory, to read and write to peripheral devices and to alter the flow of logic in the program. These functions are called the chip's instruction set and, in Cisc computers, are implemented in a special code - a microcode. The microcode translates high-level language programs into code that the processor needs to operate. IBM's mainframe computers and the Intel chips used in personal computers are based on Cisc design, with a large instruction set. This means many high-level program instructions, which would be written in a language such as Cobol or 'C', can be executed directly or with only a few microcode instructions. There is a penalty to be paid, however. The Cisc approach sacrifices chip performance for functionality. Risc technology, by contrast, turns this on its head and, by reducing the number of functions a chip has to perform and eliminating the microcode, it can increase the speed of operation. The price is an extra layer of software, needed to translate complex, high-level language instructions into a sequence of primitive Risc instructions. This penalty can, however, be turned to an advantage. The intermediate layer of software between the Risc chip and the program can be optimised according to the application. A standard commercial data processing application, for example, does not need complex mathematical functions - so these can be omitted. Similarly, a computer designed to act only as a database server, does not require graphics functions so, again, these can be omitted. Furthermore, the translation process, or compilation, which converts the high-level program into Risc instructions, can also be optimised. Specially-written programs - compilers - carry out this translation and can be specifically-designed to take advantage of the design of the Risc processor. The bottom line for manufacturers is that Risc technology can be produced as a commodity and optimised according to its end use. This reduces production costs and brings economies of scale. Hardware builders are increasingly moving their new product ranges to Risc technology. In some cases they have replaced parts of existing systems. IBM, for example, has made use of its Risc technology in sub-systems of its mainframe and minicomputer product ranges. The main use of Risc, so far, has been in high-performance workstations, particularly in the technical area. Sun Microsystems, with its SPARC Risc design, and Hewlett Packard, with its Precision Architecture (PA) Risc, have attracted supporters from across the industry. Fujitsu, Philips and Texas Instruments are among those licensed to build SPARC chips. Hitachi, Mitsubishi and Convex Computer are among those signed up to use Hewlett Packard's PA-Risc. This wide support for Risc from other manufacturers has led to the technology being used in workstations for general business applications. But although attention has centred on the use of Risc in workstation computers, it is also making inroads into special-purpose computers. The 960, a new Risc chip developed by Intel, has recently been incorporated in communications processors from Retix and Hughes LAN Systems. The flexibility of Risc processors assures them a future in the mainstream of computing and, although they are unlikely to replace Cisc processors completely, they will become increasingly important.</p>

			<p>930726 FT  26 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: Philips With investors scouting around for recovery stocks, even the seemingly lost industrial cause that trades as Philips has won admirers. This year, the Dutch giant's shares have risen 55 per cent. Its first quarter results were better than expected, while the sale of its stake in a semiconductor joint venture with Matsushita, realising Fl3bn in cash, has helped transform sentiment. Combined with Philips' fierce cost-cutting campaign, the company's balance sheet is finally returning to reasonable shape. Philips' debt-to-equity ratio has fallen from about 140 per cent to 100 per cent. Some are also becoming excited about the possible growth prospects for Philips' flat-screen technology. The hope is that this may enable Philips to make substantial inroads into the Japanese-dominated lap top computer market. Philips must now be sorely tempted to have a rights issue to reduce debt and fund expansion. Such a move might even be greeted as a sign of positive intent. The share price rise must still, however, owe more to speculative hope than experience. Philips' record of past disappointment is a very long-playing CD; its shares are still less than half the level they reached in 1986. Recession in mainland Europe will continue to dog its progress. The history of the consumer electronics industry also shows that even when sales pick up prices continue to fall. Philips' forthcoming second-quarter figures will have to provide further proof the company is recovering for the share price momentum to be maintained.</p>

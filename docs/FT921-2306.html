			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / International Company News: Mobil plans to cut capital spending programme by Dollars 1bn MOBIL, the US oil and gas group, yesterday announced plans to cut its 1992 capital expenditure appropriations by Dollars 1bn because of the company's concern about the business environment in the energy sector. Mr Allen Murray, chairman of Mobil, said the 1992 capital appropriations budget would be Dollars 4.8bn, instead of the Dollars 5.8bn anticipated. The cut includes Dollars 800m that would be deferred 'unless business conditions improve'. The Mobil chief noted that 'these are difficult times for the oil industry, with the slow pace of economic growth in much of the world having a substantial impact on all segment of our business'. Mr Murray said the company's US business, especially natural gas prices, had been weak. With the recent volatility in crude oil prices, this made it prudent to defer some investments for the time being. He noted, however, that the lag between a reduction in capital appropriations and actual spending generally takes several years. This meant that 1992 capital spending would be about the same as last year's, while the impact of deferred investments would be seen mainly beyond 1992. Mobil, which last year reported unchanged net earnings of Dollars 1.9bn on revenues of Dollars 62.7bn, also said its restructuring plan was continuing and would include further reductions in overhead costs. Mr Murray said the company would record a Dollars 75m charge for restructuring costs in the first quarter of 1992. He added that discussions were under way for the sale of petrochemicals properties, including the polystyrene business in the US and the fuels business in Norway. He said the company would also continue to sell off producing properties in the US that were 'marginally attractive and have little upside potential.' Last year, Mobil sold about Dollars 600m of assets and acquired Exxon' downstream assets in Australia. Between 1986 and 1990, Mobil sold nearly Dollars 7bn of assets, Mr Murray said. On Wall Street, Mobil's share price was marked Dollars  1/8 lower yesterday, to Dollars 60 1/4 .</p>

			<p><P> August 25, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> A U.S. magistrate in Boston ordered that fugitive financier George Koskotas be  extradited to Greece to face charges of embezzling more than $200 million from  the Bank of Crete. Magistrate Joyce Alexander rejected Koskotas' arguments that  he would face possible assassination if returned to his homeland and that the  charges are political, a category of offense that is not extraditable under a  U.S.-Greek treaty. She also said that Koskotas, 35, raised no defense to bar  his extradition. Koskotas is at the center of a financial scandal that brought  down the government of former Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou in May.  </P></p>

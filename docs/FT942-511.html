			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / Foreign policy remains Clinton's weak point: White House reshuffle addresses only a fraction of the questions raised about that area President Bill Clinton has made every effort to avoid presenting his White House reshuffle as an attempt to correct an operation that has gone wrong, but if any segment of his administration can be said to need correction, it is the foreign policy team. The decision this week to move Mr David Gergen, the master of former President Ronald Reagan's communications strategy who was recruited to advise the White House last year, into a foreign policy role only addresses a fraction of the questions that have been raised about the Clinton foreign policy operation. And although Mr William Perry has replaced Mr Les Aspin at the Pentagon, Mr Strobe Talbott has taken over as number two at the state department and Mr Richard Holbrooke is about to return from the embassy in Bonn to handle European affairs, rumours of a further overhaul of the foreign policy team abound. Neither Mr Warren Christopher, the secretary of state, nor Mr Anthony Lake, the White House national security adviser, has been given much chance by the Washington gossip chain of lasting beyond the end of the year, with former Vice President Walter Mondale and even General Colin Powell rumoured as possible replacements. Mr Leon Panetta, the new White House chief of staff, was less than ringing in his endorsement of the foreign policy team. 'I think at the present time obviously we are going with the players that are there,' he said in a television interview, though he added that 'the president does not feel that the foreign policy area has gone astray'. One failing, according to critics, has been the inadequate articulation of a foreign policy vision. Mr Lake's concept of the enlargement of democracy has not satisfied all appetites. Administration officials point out, with reason, that their predecessors had an easier task, living within the doctrine of containment of the Soviet Union. In the post-cold war era, the security dimension is less of an overriding priority, and other interests, such as trade and human rights, jostle for attention. Mr Gergen excels at explaining why a policy makes sense, and as a senior adviser to both Mr Christopher and Mr Clinton he could bring greater clarity in this area. 'He will make a major contribution as we formulate policies here at the department and he will bring to our discussions at the White House a well-honed sense of how this administration can better communicate its foreign policy goals to the American people,' Mr Christopher said in enthusiastically welcoming Mr Gergen aboard. Yet it is clear that Mr Gergen's assignment is not the final answer to Mr Clinton's foreign policy woes. This, after all, is the problem that was supposed to be corrected by the promotion last year of Mr Talbott, an articulate former journalist, and by Vice President Al Gore taking on a larger role in speaking for the administration on foreign policy issues. Left unanswered is the question of whether the Clinton administration, and Mr Clinton himself, has the capacity to decide on a policy in the international arena and to stick to it. Mr Gergen himself, who never wanted to remain in a prominent role in this Democratic administration in the run-up to November's congressional elections, expects to go back to the private sector - possibly to a university - by the end of the year. Some unkind souls suggested yesterday that he had only wanted to add this foreign policy credential to his curriculum vitae in order to increase the already impressive fees he can command on the lecture circuit once he leaves the administration.</p>

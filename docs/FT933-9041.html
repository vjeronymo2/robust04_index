			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / Technology: Drugs stick to the cause - A look at recent advances in the fight against inflammation New research into the process of inflammation over the past few years may soon give birth to a promising new family of drugs, remarkable in their ability to treat conditions as diverse as arthritis, cancer and the common cold. Inflammation is such a common human affliction that it runs the risk of seeming unworthy of notice. The condition can be debilitating and sometimes even fatal. Crippling pain is associated with inflammation-linked diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, asthma and Crohn's disease (inflammation of the colon), and the condition is often fatal in the case of trauma, organ transplant rejection and certain cardiovascular complications. Considering the large number of diseases associated with swelling, current treatments seem hopelessly inadequate. 'Treatments on the market now mainly attempt to deal with the pain, but not the cause,' says Dale Cumming, a senior scientist at the biotechnology group Genetics Institute, and an inflammation researcher. A better understanding of the process of inflammation over the past few years, though, has at least 27 pharmaceutical companies - including Merck, Wellcome, SmithKline and a host of biotechnology groups - racing to place a new family of drugs on the market. These new drugs would address the cause of the swelling, rather than the symptoms it produces. Much of the research is still at an early stage, but a number of companies are about to launch clinical trials on the first compounds. 'The potential market for just one of these diseases - arthritis - is in the billions of dollars each year,' says Roy Lobb, director of biological research for the bio-technology group Biogen, which is developing its own anti-inflammatory drugs. 'So you can imagine how large the total market is for all the diseases related to inflammation.' Inflammation results from the over-stimulation of the immune system. Under normal conditions, when a bacterial infection is present in the body, white blood cells race to do battle in the affected site. Inflammation occurs when the white blood cells get out of control. In some cases, such as trauma, the danger of infection may be very real, but the immune system has over-reacted. In others, such as arthritis, no infection is present; the white blood cells simply 'misread' the body's chemical signals and wreak their havoc. Just a few years ago, scientists began to understand the importance of 'cell adhesion molecules' in the process of inflammation. When a bacterial infection invades the body, certain chemical signals are picked up by the endothelial cells lining the blood vessels and the white blood cells present in the blood. Linked to these cells are a group of adhesion molecules - the same sort of sticky substances which hold the human body together - which react to the chemical messages. While dormant, these molecules have no impact, but when turned on they cause the white blood cells to adhere to the endothelial cells. Once they have stuck, they begin a process known as 'migration': they crawl out of the blood stream and toward the infected area. Cell adhesion molecules located on the endothelial cells are referred to as 'selectins', while those on the white blood cells are referred to mainly as 'integrins'. 'I think of the selectins as one half of a velcro strip, and integrins as the other,' says Daniel Witt, vice-president of technology acquisition for the biotechnology group Repligen. 'When they are both attached to each other, they stick tight. Then, the white blood cells move with octopus-like suction cups to the site of infection.' If either the integrins or selectins fail to be activated, the white blood cells are unable to stick, and inflammation is avoided. This is the aim of the new anti-inflammatory drug candidates, dubbed 'cell adhesion molecule inhibitors'. One of the surprising findings of the past few years is that these new drugs may address diseases not strictly associated with inflammation. Cancer, for instance, probably uses cell adhesion molecules to spread through the body. 'There is a great deal of evidence linking this sort of process to the migration of cancer cells from a tumour to other parts of the body,' says Hubert Shoemaker, chairman of Centocor, a biotechnology group studying inflammation. The problem with cell adhesion inhibitors is they run the risk of shutting down the body's immune system. 'What's driving research now is the challenge of addressing inflammation while avoiding total blockage of the body's immunological response capabilities,' says James Paulson, vice-president in charge of research and development at drug group Cytel. The gravity of such a shut-down is driven home by the recent discovery of rare illnesses involving the inactivity of integrins and selectins. Leucocyte adhesion deficiency (LADI) is a serious illness affecting patients who lack sufficient integrins on their white blood cells to fight off infections. They usually succumb to a number of illnesses, and sometimes die, at an early age. An even more recently uncovered illness, LADII, involves a selectin deficiency. While these patients have a weakened immune response system, they are still capable of warding off many illnesses. The dichotomy between these two diseases has led some researchers to theorise that selectins grip less tightly than integrins. 'If this is true, then it makes sense to target selectins rather than integrins as a way of diminishing but not completely shutting down the immune system,' says Paulson. Another possibility may be to target certain types of integrins only. Neutrophils, for instance, are short-lived white blood cells. 'If we only target the integrins on the neutrophils, which last only eight to 12 hours in the body, we would have a short-lived, and therefore a more controllable, impact on the immune system,' said Witt. Because of the different immunological issues involved, it is unlikely that companies will come up with a single generic pill to treat all illnesses involving inflammation. But there is likely to be a great deal of cross-over between research on the diseases involved. While the new family of inflammation drugs are unlikely to provide miraculous cures, they do hold a new promise for patients suffering from a wide range of illnesses. After years of inadequate treatments, these patients may finally be offered a viable alternative to today's treatments.</p>

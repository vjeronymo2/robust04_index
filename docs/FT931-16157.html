			<p>930108 FT  08 JAN 93 / Observer: Teddy transfer Brussels officials' dreams of monetary and political union won't be any sweeter for the impending loss of their 'Teddy Bear' - alias Jurgen Trumpf, Germany's ambassador to the European Community for the past three years. Having earned the nickname because of his softly-spoken modesty, the 61-year-old is returning home to be state secretary in the Bonn foreign ministry. While his replacement in Brussels isn't yet named, Trumpf will certainly be a hard man to follow. He was much admired by diplomats for his knowledge and negotiating skills, particularly in the run-up to the Maastricht treaty. A true believer in European union, he was dismayed by the recent decline in public support for the enterprise. He also fretted about his own country's attitude to the community. Perhaps that's why he once said he could imagine an EC without Germany, but not without France.</p>

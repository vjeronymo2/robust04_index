			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 20 Apr (MENA)--Dr. Nabil Sha'th, head of the  Palestinian delegation to the negotiations with Israel on the  implementation of self-rule in Gaza and Jericho, has announced  that the Civilian Affairs Committee completed all its work at  dawn today and that the results will be forwarded to the heads  of the two delegations for adoption.    Sha'th told reporters: We can reach an agreement today after  introducing some necessary amendments concerning the transfer of  all civilian powers. This agreement will then be adopted by  myself, as head of the Palestinian delegation, and by General  Amnon Shahaq, head of the Israeli delegation.    On the broad lines of the agreement on the transfer of water  authority, Dr. Sha'th said the agreement stipulates that water  and its full management in Gaza and Jericho come under  Palestinian control. This includes the drilling of new wells  and the management of old ones, he said.    He said Israel will continue to supply Gaza and the  settlements with water. The Palestinians will pay Israel the  cost of the water they receive, he said, adding: The water that  will go to the settlements will pass through our territory and  will be under our jurisdiction but the Israeli company of  Meqorot will continue to supply the settlers with water.    He said the settlements will receive the same amount of  water  they are receiving now. These, Sha'th explained, are the main  points of the agreement but the details of the transfer of water  authority will be announced when the agreement is signed.    Sha'th said the Israelis will have control inside the  settlements as stated by the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of  Principles signed in Washington on 13 September.    Noting that water supplies cannot be divided, he said  information will be exchanged on the use of water, meters, and  so on.    The aim, Sha'th said, is to reach an agreement that  preserves  our water resources, endangered during the years of occupation.  He said the current level of salinity is dangerously high.    Sha'th said: I expect that the new Palestinian leadership  will focus attention on preserving and promoting water resources.    Sha'th said the Legal Affairs Committee is making extremely  slow progress, with the problem of legal jurisdiction still not  solved.    Concerning the Security Affairs Committee, he said, some  progress has been made and work on some papers that have been  pending since last week may be completed this afternoon.    On the progress made in the Security Affairs Committee,  Sha'th explained that the negotiators worked out some details  concerning the Palestinian police, the detailed Israeli  withdrawal plan, some measures concerning the demarcation of the  border and the Palestinian self-rule regions, and some measures  concerning roads, joint patrols, and crossing points between  Israel and Gaza. He said these issues could be completed this  evening.    Sha'th said there are several civilian and security papers  as  well as the 24-point general agreement that serves as an  introduction to the various issues contained in the appendices.  He said four out of the 24 points in this agreement remain to  be dealt with. They include the legal jurisdiction. He  stressed that the general agreement cannot be completed without  finishing with the legal jurisdiction issue.    Sha'th said he could not speculate on when the negotiations  would be complete. This, he said, depends on the other side.    Muhammad Dahlan, a member of the Palestinian delegation and  head of the Detainees and Confidence-Building Committee, said an  initial agreement to release 5,000 detainees in the next stage  has been reached. He said negotiations will continue to reach a  final agreement through two subcommittees to release the rest of  the detainees.    But a responsible Palestinian source said Israel fears  releasing the rest of the detainees in the absence of the  Palestinian authority and it fears that the release may have a  negative security impact on the Israelis.    Dahlan said that all the Palestinians deported during the  intifadah will be returned.    He said that 54 deportees have already returned, six of them  yesterday. Eleven more will return to Gaza through Cairo  tomorrow, Thursday, he said.</p>

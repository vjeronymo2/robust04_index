			<p><P> September 7, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TERRY TELLS JURY: 'I HAVE TO FACE GOD SOMEDAY'  </P> <P> Comparing himself to civil rights leaders who "stood up to . . . tyranny,"  anti-abortion leader Randall Terry tried one last time Wednesday to persuade a  jury, in the name of justice, to find him and his co-defendants innocent of  wrongdoing.  </P> <P> In the closing argument in his trial on charges of trespassing and conspiracy,  Terry, 30-year-old founder of Operation Rescue, reminded the Municipal Court  jury of periods in history when blacks were relegated to the backs of buses and  women had no right to vote.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'These Dark Hours'  </P> <P> "But during these dark hours, there were people who stood up to the tyranny,"  Terry said. "And what did these people have in common? Susan B. Anthony  arrested, Rosa Parks arrested, Dr. (Martin Luther) King arrested. But being  arrested is not a crime."  </P> <P> And like those activists, Terry said, he hopes to be vindicated.  </P> <P> Terry is one of five anti-abortion activists being tried on a host of  misdemeanor charges stemming from the March 25 blockade of a women's clinic on  Westmoreland Avenue.  </P> <P> Terry is representing himself, as are co-defendants Jeff White, 31, and Michael  McMonagle, 36. Donald Bennette, 36, and Andrew Eppink, also on trial, are being  represented by counsel.  </P> <P> As members of the defense team presented their final arguments to the jury,  they reiterated a key contention -- that political pressure from key city  officials prompted Los Angeles police to arrest and abuse anti-abortion  demonstrators at the March sit-in.  </P> <P> And while never admitting that they broke the law, the defense team continually  referred to a much higher law than that set forth by the state.  </P> <P> "One of the reasons I'm in this is because as an individual I have to face God  someday," Terry said.  </P> <P> " 'Woe to those who decree unjust situations,' " said Terry, quoting from the  Book of Isaiah.  </P> <P> He earlier referred to the "inalienable rights" guaranteed in the Declaration  of Independence.  </P> <P> "God gives people rights, and the founders of our country knew that," said  Terry, who later added that he wanted to be able to tell his yet-unborn  grandchildren that "I did all I could during that hour of history" when  abortion was legal.  </P> <P> Municipal Judge Richard A. Paez ruled before the trial began that the  "necessity" defense, which holds that laws can be broken in the interest of  preventing greater harm, did not apply in this case because abortion is legal.  </P> <P> Yet the moot argument has been brought up constantly, much to the annoyance of  the judge, who has in the past threatened the defendants with contempt. On  Wednesday he had to order the jury at least eight times to disregard the  statements made by the defense.  </P> <P> In the end, Terry conceded that the morality of abortion would not be decided  in a Los Angeles municipal courtroom.  </P> <P> "You are not voting to overturn Roe vs. Wade," Terry told the jurors, referring  to the landmark decision that legalized abortion. "If you acquit us, you're not  voting to overthrow the government. You are not voting for anarchy. What you  are calling for is justice."  </P> <P> Closing arguments are expected to conclude today, at which time jurors will  begin deliberations.  </P></p>

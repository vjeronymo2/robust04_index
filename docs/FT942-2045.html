			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / International Company News: Domos forms alliance in Mexico telecoms race Grupo Domos, the private Mexican telecommunications company, plans to apply for a long-distance telephone licence in Mexico as part of an alliance with Grupo Financiero Serfin, Mexico's third largest bank, and a large international telephone carrier. Domos last week agreed to purchase 49 per cent of Cuba's national telephone company. Bell South already has an alliance with Domos, and it may be the international carrier with which Domos is now negotiating. Domos and its partners plan to form a new subsidiary which will invest more than Dollars 4bn in Mexico's telecommunications sector, Mr Javier Garza Calderon, company chairman, told the Mexican news service Infosel. Apart from applying for a long-distance telephone licence in Mexico, the company is considering investing in a basic wireless telephone system in the country, in mobile telecommunications, value-added services, and in subscription television. Mexico will open up its long-distance telephone market - currently controlled by Telefonos de Mexico, the national telephone carrier - to competition from August 1996. So far, Banamex with MCI, Iusacell with Bell Atlantic, and Grupo Alfa have expressed interest in applying for a licence. Bancomer, the second largest bank, is reported to be looking for a foreign partner before declaring its interest. Although Domos has plenty of money, having recently sold its cellular interests in the north of Mexico to Motorola, the US company, its ambitious investment plans will almost certainly need a substantial injection of new capital. Domos is controlled by Mr Garza Calderon, a member of the extremely wealthy Garza family in Monterrey and a director of Serfin. In the 1980s, Mr Garza Calderon's father unsuccessfully sought to seize control of Grupo Visa, one of Mexico's largest conglomerates, from his cousin, Eugenio Garza Laguera, in a family squabble that turned into a bitter takeover battle. Last week, Domos agreed to pay some Dollars 1.5bn over several year years for 49 per cent of Emtel-Cuba. The investment includes the cost of expanding and modernising the island's dilapidated telephone network. Domos is looking for a foreign partner in Cuba to provide telecommunications technology.</p>

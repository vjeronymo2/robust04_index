			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Special article" by He Chong (6320 3095) ] </F>   [Text] Hong Kong, 28 Apr (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--Former  U.S. President Richard Nixon has already been laid in his final  resting place. At the state funeral, President Clinton and  former Presidents Ford, Carter, Reagan, and Bush, as well as  many other dignitaries were present. It was an occasion of  glory and of mourning.    Nevertheless, Americans at home and abroad have varying  opinions about Nixon's historical achievements and faults.  Although Watergate disgraced him, his three major diplomatic  achievements were visible for all to see, namely that he ended  the Vietnam War through talks, opened the door to the  establishment of Sino-U.S. relations by his personal visit to  China, and defrosted the Cold War by reaching an arms reduction  agreement with the Soviet Union. These three major events have  had worldwide influence and will surely be recorded in the  history books. Moreover, today, U.S. China policy, which he  designed himself, continues to influence the White House and has  a positive part in Sino-U.S. relations.    Nixon always viewed Sino-U.S. relations from a strategic  plane and with foresight. Since stepping down, he has always  opposed pressuring China by linking most-favored-nation [MFN]  trading status with the human rights question. In his last book  "Beyond Peace" he wrote: "Today, China's economic power makes  U.S. lectures about human rights imprudent. Within a decade, it  will make them irrelevant. Within two decades, it will make  them laughable. By then, the Chinese may threaten to withhold  MFN status from the United States unless we do more to improve  living conditions (of the poor) in Detroit, Harlem, and South  Central Los Angeles."    Obviously, Nixon predicted from the historical angle that  China would become a first-rate power within two decades and  that it would be so strong as to get tough with the United  States over human rights issues. However, he may have forgotten  that China has repeatedly declared that it "will never seek  hegemony." Even though China may become strong, it is certainly  not going to pressure others using human rights or any other  issues.    In all events, Nixon never changed his view of China's world  status and international role even when Sino-U.S. relations were  at a stalemate and going through the most difficult of times.  For example, in the wake of the "4 June Incident" in Beijing in  1989, the U.S. administration and other Western countries  jointly imposed "economic sanctions" on China, leading to the  possible crisis of renewed confrontation in Sino-U.S. relations.  In response to this, Nixon, who had stayed out of public life  for a long time, publicly stood up to show his disapproval of  "sanctions against China" and energetically urged maintaining a  channel of dialogue between China and the United States. In  late October that same year, despite criticisms from the  government and the public, he paid a visit to Beijing, bringing  a message from former President Bush to Deng Xiaoping and acting  as a broker between them. Afterward, he paid another three  visits to China, contributing to the restoration of normal  relations between China and the United States.    Nixon's firm stance on maintaining Sino-U.S. friendly and  cooperative relations was derived from his profound analysis of  the international situation. In the 1960's, he was vice  president in the Eisenhower administration and was a prominent  anticommunist figure. Later, after touring all over the world,  his horizons were broadened and he began to realize that it was  impossible for the United States to solely dominate the world  and nor was it possible to control the world in collaboration  with the Soviet Union. At that time the Soviet Union had a  wilder ambition to solely dominate the world than the United  States. In the meantime, China had already broken through U.S.  encirclement and had stood up in the East. In 1968, Nixon won  the presidential election. He appointed Henry Kissinger as  White House security adviser, revised the foreign policy  strategy together with him, pursued the "world triangular  balance strategy," and admitted that the world had not only two  poles but a third one, namely China. In 1971, he resolved to  establish diplomatic relations with China and China also wished  to usher in new diplomatic prospects and expand economic and  trade exchanges with the West, thus it was high time they  established diplomatic relations. The Chinese top leadership  pointed out that Sino-U.S. relations were founded on common  interests, not on ideologies or social systems. Nixon agreed  with this viewpoint.    As the 1990's unfolded, drastic changes took place in  Eastern  Europe and the Soviet Union disintegrated. Some Americans said  that "China's role has weakened" and the "CPC will not stand"  and that the world has only one pole, the United States.  Therefore, they were publicly exerting pressure on China using  the human rights issue in an attempt to bring about the  "peaceful evolution" of China. This is the root cause of the  numerous disputes between China and the United States in recent  years.    Because whoever starts the trouble should end it, so the  Clinton administration should act on Nixon's China policy, face  China's speedy economic development squarely, and separate the  MFN status issue from the human rights question. Only by doing  so can Sino- U.S. relations further develop.</p>

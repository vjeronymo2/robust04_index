			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by special correspondent Luis Garasino from Brasilia] </F>   [Excerpt] Defense Minister Oscar Camilion has described as  "delirious" the opinion of a Sao Paulo newspaper stating that  the purchase of 36 Skyhawk fighter-bombers by Argentina upsets  the regional strategic balance and puts the Brazilian Air Force  in a position of inferiority.    Camilion told CLARIN that, even if the neighbor countries do  not purchase any materiel, when the Skyhawks join our country's  Air Force "they will barely be enough to reestablish a sort of  regional air balance."    The defense minister -- who is on a five-day visit to Brazil  -- believes it is a "very personal" opinion of the O ESTADO DE  SAO PAULO editorialist, an opinion "that is not shared in any  way" because "I have not received any direct or indirect  expression of concern from the Brazilian Government areas that I  have toured so far."    Camilion met Army Minister General Zenildo Gonzaga Zoroastro  de Lucena, with whom he discussed the possibility of Brazilian  officers joining the Argentine peacekeeping forces that are  operating in Croatia, Cyprus, and Mozambique. Camilion will be  received by Brazilian President Itamar Franco today. The  Brazilian Government is concerned because some 600 U.S. soldiers  will be deployed in Paraguay as of May.    During Camilion's meeting with the Army minister, they also  discussed an increase in the exchange between the two armies at  the level of company grade officers from operational units.  Discussing the border security issue, Minister Camilion noted:  "The Brazilians envy our national border police and regret the  fact that they do not have a coast guard corps like our coast  guard."    During these talks it became obvious that the southern  border  does not represent a concern for the Brazilian military, which  has initiated a redeployment of their forces toward northern  Brazil and the Amazon region. It also became obvious that  Brazil is worried about drug trafficking but is reluctant to  join transnational strategies to struggle against this scourge.  [passage omitted]</p>

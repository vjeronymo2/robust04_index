			<p>931213 FT  13 DEC 93 / Crunch time for Swansea staff This week about 40 executives from EDS-Scicon, the US computing services company, will arrive in Swansea to begin interviews that will mark the end of DVOIT, the Department of Transport information-technology agency. The organisation is being assimilated into EDS-Scicon; its staff will either become EDS-Scicon employees or leave. DVOIT is the first government agency to be privatised under the government's current round of civil service reforms. Its experience may illuminate the way ahead for dozens of Whitehall agencies responsible for everything from defence accounts to passports. Some potential buyers fear, however, that they will court unpopularity if they are forced to cut jobs heavily in a search for economies. 'If you go around butchering people, you do not survive long in the market,' says Mr Charles Cox of Hoskyns, a company which withdrew from the bidding for DVOIT. Others worry that the terms of the contracts are being set too rigidly. The principal aim of EDS-Scicon's purchase of DVOIT is profitability through efficiency and cost-saving. Mr Marwin Rifka, head of EDS-Scicon's public-sector division, was unwilling to set a figure on the savings he believed could be achieved by absorbing DVOIT, but he said it would be above the 25 per cent the government was demanding from all bidders for the agency. Immediate savings would be felt by DVOIT's primary customers, which include the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency, the Vehicle Inspectorate, the Driving Standards Agency and the Department of Transport. Some 70 per cent of DVOIT's work is carried out for the DVLA. This first round of cost-cutting will be achieved using methods traditional among facilities management companies, of which EDS-Scicon is the world's largest example. DVOIT's workload will be squeezed on to EDS-Scicon's computers at Stockley Park in west London and the Swansea data centre will close. Mr Rifka points out that there is an excess of data-processing centres. The DVOIT computers will be used elsewhere in the EDS group and staff will either be redeployed or will leave. The existing 370 DVOIT staff will be asked to change jobs, to learn new skills and possibly to move to Stockley Park. Mr Rifka says that, if staff refused all the company's overtures, the DVOIT workload could be handled by a mere 54 people. His intention, however, is to establish a centre of expertise in Swansea manned by at least 250 ex-DVOIT staff. Perhaps 10 per cent of the staff might be persuaded to move, he said. The second round of efficiencies will come from EDS-Scicon computer specialists working in collaboration with DVOIT's customers to improve operational efficiency through better, more modern, computer systems. This is likely to lead to the kind of improvements noticeable by the public: rapid turnround of motor licence updates, for example, or faster renewal of licences. EDS-Scicon has substantial expertise in ways of developing such computer systems rapidly. Furthermore, unlike a government department which might have to maintain a costly full-time team of experts in computer development, it can move systems specialists from other parts of its international operations to tackle specific problems. There are still concerns that the government is demanding rigid contracts over unrealistically long periods. Contracts were being drawn up to run for 10 years when most computer specialists thought five years was a long time. 'They do not know what their requirements will be in five years, let alone 10,' one said. 'The policy may change; there may be a new government; technology may have changed the economics again.'</p>

			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Chile in two minds over copper projects - David Pilling reports on differing official attitudes to a pair of 'world class' mines NOTHING BETTER illustrates the tough decisions facing Codelco, Chile's huge state-owned copper corporation, than the contrasting fortunes of its two most prestigious development projects. While foreign companies are falling over themselves to invest in El Abra mine, potentially the sixth largest in the world, plans for Radomiro Tomic, which is at least as big, have been indefinitely shelved. The difference between the two mines is one of status. El Abra is considered a new project, allowing Codelco, under legislation passed last year, to develop it as a joint venture with foreign companies. Radomiro Tomic, on the other hand, which lies close to the world's largest copper mine, Chuquicamata, is classified as a replacement mine, and as such is disqualified from joint-venture development, leaving Codelco with the problem of finding the estimated Dollars 450m start-up cost. The chances of this happening soon were severely dented in May when the finance ministry, which directly controls Codelco's investment budget, refused to grant sufficient funds. Today, while executives attached to Radomiro Tomic twiddle their thumbs, those involved in El Abra are frantically preparing bids in time for the 20 September deadline. 'El Abra has become Codelco's great hope now that Radomiro Tomic has been snatched away,' says Mr Jason Webb, a Santiago-based mining journalist. There are 17 companies, including most of the big multinationals, competing for the prize, which executives describe as the biggest copper mine for sale in the world. The winner will take a 51 per cent stake in the project and is expected to invest about Dollars 450m. A pre-feasibility study carried out by Codelco found at least 500m tonnes of oxide reserves and estimated annual production at around 120,000 tonnes of copper cathodes over 20 years. Recently, the idea has been floated of doubling the annual production and halving the mine's life, a strategy that would involve a heftier initial investment. Codelco, which intends to award the contract within two months of receiving bids, hopes to start production by 1998. Once companies have been judged technically proficient the contract will go to the highest bidder, according to Mr Jorge Bande, Codelco's vice president for development. Mr Colin Sinclair, general manager of the Chilean division of Australia's North Broken Hill Peko - which is bidding for the contract in partnership with local Sociedad Minera Pudahuel - believes that Codelco will benefit considerably from joint ventures of this type, in terms of both the financial muscle and the technical knowledge brought in by the private sector. 'The point of the joint venture is to get the copper industry moving again, to get them back in the big league for which they need foreign expertise,' says Mr Sinclair. Mr Bande agrees that private-sector participation has an important role to play in Codelco's future. 'The joint venture (in El Abra) will enable us to develop a major project which had been sleeping in Codelco's hands owing to our financial restrictions,' he says. Working alongside an established foreign mining company 'can only enrich our experience and knowhow'. Apart from El Abra, Codelco is negotiating exploration joint ventures for six of its mining prospects and, according to Mr Bande, expects to open negotiations for further joint ventures over the next few months. Foreign interest remains high. 'Chile is elephant country,' says Mr Sinclair referring to the quality and quantity of Chile's copper mines. 'If you want to find an elephant, this is where you come.' But, for the moment at least, one elephant, Radomiro Tomic, is safe from the hunter's gun. The government's decision to withhold start-up funds - seen by observers as a political, not a financial, decision - means that the mine, described by officials as 'world class', cannot leave the drawing board. It is understood that the government's refusal to authorise funds for Radomiro Tomic stemmed from an unwillingness to pour money into new projects until Codelco, which is far less efficient than its private-sector counterparts, has demonstrated greater success in tightening its flabby operations. The administration's stalling tactics have triggered a debate about the possible restructuring of Codelco to enable it to develop new mines. One proposal was to break it up into autonomous divisions which would be allowed to raise start-up capital as they saw fit. Another idea was to let Codelco sell off its non-core businesses, such as the Tocopilla power station, raising cash which could be reinvested in new operations. Such proposals, seen by many as a form of privatisation by stealth, have met stiff opposition from Codelco's strong unions and from politicians sensitive to public opinion. Not even former President Augusto Pinochet dared to privatise Codelco, which is viewed as a symbol of national pride. Any immediate change in direction seems increasingly less likely as December's presidential elections draw nearer. Even more improbable is fresh legislation to extend joint-venture status to replacement mines such as Radomiro Tomic. In spite of the contrasting fates of El Abra and Radomiro Tomic, Mr Bande insists that joint ventures are not necessarily the only way forward. 'The ideal way to develop Codelco in the long term is to combine its wholly-owned projects with those in which it has a joint venture partner,' he says. The two strategies 'are not contradictory, but complementary'. Observers say it is vital that Radomiro Tomic should not be 'permanently paralysed' and that a decision is taken as quickly as possible. According to one commentator: 'For every day lost, the project loses a little bit more of its economic value'.</p>

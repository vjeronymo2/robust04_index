			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Retailer bid battle looms Food retailers were enlivened by an affair that started the day looking like a gentlemen's arrangement but ended with the prospect of a full-scale takeover battle. Supermarket chain Tesco made a 225p a share agreed bid for Dundee-based chain William Low; shares in Low topped the bid, prompting immediate speculation of rival bids. Analysts cited J. Sainsbury as having an interest because of its relatively small presence in Scotland. But the market was stunned by an announcement from the group that it was 'reviewing' the bid and would make a formal statement shortly. This was followed, after the market closed by a formal statement that Sainsbury's was 'requesting in formation from Wm Low and is considering its position'. Mr Bill Myers, retail analyst with Yamaichi said: 'I am very surprised - if it goes ahead it will be the first time ever that Sainsbury's has made a hostile bid.' There was also talk of Argyll, owner of Safeways supermarkets, making an offer although the group said there was 'no foundation at all in the idea. ' Low's shares soared 67 to 226p, Argyll gained a penny to 236p, Sainsbury's rose 10 1/2 to 399 1/2 p and Tesco 10 1/2 to 232 1/2 p.</p>

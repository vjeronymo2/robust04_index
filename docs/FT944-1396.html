			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / International Capital Markets: Moore reduces stake in business-forms partnership Canada's Moore Corporation has taken a big step towards shifting its emphasis from paper forms to more sophisticated information-handling systems by selling the bulk of its stake in Toppan Moore, Japan's biggest business-forms supplier. Moore will receive Y34.4bn (Dollars 343m) from the sale of 35 per cent of Toppan Moore to its Japanese partner, Toppan Printing. The deal, which will be completed early next year, will raise Toppan's stake in the joint venture to 90 per cent, leaving Moore with 10 per cent. Toppan Moore has contributed an average of 10 cents a share over the past three years to Moore's annual earnings, which totalled USDollars 82.2m, or 83 cents a share, in the first nine months of 1994. Moore had planned to reduce its stake in Toppan Moore through a public share offering in Japan, but that was expected to take up to two years. 'We have got the same deal, dealing directly with Toppan,' Ms Shoba Khetrapal, Moore treasurer, said yesterday. Moore, which claims to be the world's largest supplier of business forms, is undergoing a shake-up spearheaded by Mr Reto Braun, who took over as chief executive in late 1993. The Toronto-based company unveiled a new business plan earlier this year to keep abreast of the shift from paper to electronic information sources. It aims to concentrate on three businesses: forms and form-management systems; labelling systems, including bar-codes; and customer communications, such as direct mail. The proceeds of the Toppan Moore sale will be used for acquisitions in these fields, including further investments in Japan and other Asian countries. Moore recently bought a 60 per cent stake in a new information-handling systems joint venture in China. Its partner is Shanghai Jielong Industry Corporation. As part of its new strategy, Moore has also bought a 20 per cent stake in JetForm, an Ottawa-based specialist in electronic forms technology, and has formed an alliance with Datamax of Orlando, Florida, to develop a thermal bar-code printer for linerless labels. Mr Braun aims to expand revenues by 10 per cent a year for the next five years, with more than half the growth coming from alliances and acquisitions. Moore's sales totalled almost Dollars 1.8bn in the period January-September 1994.</p>

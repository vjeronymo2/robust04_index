			<p><P> March 5, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> IRVINE'S SECOND-HALF RALLY ISN'T ENOUGH, 78-70  </P> <P> Midway through the first half Saturday night, it appeared the colossal collapse  was complete. UC Irvine, a team that had seemed to pull it all together just a  month ago, was 23 points behind and it appeared the Anteaters would end their  regular season with not so much as a whimper.  </P> <P> At least they went down with a growl and a yelp.  </P> <P> UC Santa Barbara, which had frolicked to a 37-14 first-half lead, made 12 of 14  free throws in the final two minutes and hung on for a 78-70 Big West  Conference victory in front of 5,000 in the Bren Center. It was Irvine's fifth  consecutive defeat at home.  </P> <P> The loss means Irvine (11-16 overall, 8-10 in the conference) will finish in  eighth place and play the winner of today's University of the Pacific-San Jose  State game in the first round of the Big West tournament at Long Beach Arena at  9 p.m. Wednesday. Santa Barbara (20-7, 11-7) takes third place and meets Long  Beach on Thursday at 4 p.m.  </P> <P> Many in the sellout crowd were Gaucho fans . . . and many more probably wished  they were in the first half. But the Anteaters battled back and twice closed  the gap to one -- at 64-63 and 66-65 -- late in the game.  </P> <P> Gaucho guard Carlton Davenport drove the middle and tossed in a high-arched  five-footer to put Santa Barbara ahead, 66-63, with 2:47 remaining. It was the  last field goal of the game for the Gauchos, but they made the free throws they  needed to win.  </P> <P> "I thought Irvine played with tremendous intensity, heart and determination in  the second half," Gaucho Coach Jerry Pimm said. "They deserved to get back in  the game.  </P> <P> "It was a very physical game and I think Irvine wanted it that way, to stop the  clock and hope their free throw percentage was better than ours. But we got the  ones we needed."  </P> <P> Santa Barbara finished the game with three starters -- forward Paul Johnson,  center Eric McArthur and guard Davenport -- on the bench with five fouls. And  backup center Gary Cray was ejected early in the second half for a flagrant  foul when he threw an elbow at freshman Elgin Rogers.  </P> <P> The Anteaters started the game without sophomore power forward Ricky Butler,  who has been the main man underneath for Irvine in recent weeks. Butler  suffered a severe thigh bruise in practice Friday and wasn't even in uniform.  </P> <P> It was senior night for Irvine and, in the early going, the two Anteater  seniors -- center Mike Doktorczyk and guard Kevin Floyd -- either felt  compelled to personally make up for the loss of Butler or were under the  impression that seniors had a license to free-lance on their night.  </P> <P> Floyd scored Irvine's first six points and finished with 17, but he also shot  two airballs, dribbled the ball off his shoes a couple of times and tried to  take the ball to the hoop on a one-on-three solo flight.  </P> <P> Doktorczyk made just one of six first-half shots and finished four of 13 --  including zero for five on three-pointers -- but he made all 16 free throws he  attempted and scored 24 points.  </P> <P> "We just let them take it to us in the first half," Doktorczyk said. "Our  defense was pretty weak. Coach (Bill) Mulligan challenged our manhood at  halftime."  </P> <P> Irvine responded, but the Anteaters still shot just 42% in the half (39% for  the game) and came up short when Santa Barbara made its free throws. Forward  Mike Doyle, who led the Gauchos with 25 points, was four for four from the line  down the stretch.  </P> <P> Still, had Irvine not made the run, the Anteaters might as well have mailed in  the rest of the season.  </P> <P> "I don't know, a loss is a loss," Floyd said. "Well, I guess it's better that  we pulled ourselves up. But I had my mother and father and brother, all the  people I love, in the crowd.  </P> <P> "My father's gonna take off work to watch us play in the tournament and I'm  gonna kill myself to make sure we don't lose. We've got to win four in a row to  do anything."  </P> <P> It won't be easy. Assuming the Anteaters and Fresno State -- the seventh-seeded  team -- win Wednesday, Irvine, as the lowest remaining seed, will get to play  Nevada Las Vegas on Thursday night.  </P> <P> "We were trying to get away from playing Wednesday night," Mulligan said in  reference to the two qualifying games pitting No. 7 against No. 10 and No. 8  vs. No. 9. "We dug ourselves a hole tonight just like we dug ourselves a hole  by losing five straight at home."  </P></p>

			<p>920907 FT  07 SEP 92 / Society chief criticises Tories THE HEAD of Britain's second-largest building society yesterday criticised the government for lacking a housing policy and urged it to intervene with radical measures to revive the flagging housing market. Mr Tim Melville-Ross, chief executive of Nationwide Building Society, said on Channel 4 that he believed the market had bottomed out and would eventually right itself. He added that government assistance would help to speed the recovery in the housing market and thereby stimulate the economy as a whole. There was also a 'golden opportunity' to remove some of the anomalies that were partly responsible for the present difficulties in the market. Mr Melville-Ross proposed a mortgage benefit - comparable to housing benefit  -for homeowners on low incomes, an increase in mortgage tax relief for first-time buyers and ways to stimulate the rentals market. He suggested that mortgage benefit might be tapered according to income rises alongside housing benefit, which is available to lowincome tenants still in employment. He said that would 'solve a lot of problems for many people whose mortgages are currently in arrears who have found that they are just unable to cope.' Mr Melville-Ross also proposed mortgage tax relief for first-time buyers for a limited period in order to encourage entrants to the market. He said the current tax relief, which applies regardless of income level, should be restructured to target more first-time buyers and those who actually need it. He also suggested measures to revive the private-rented sector, such as arrangements that would make it more attractive for institutions to provide rented housing.</p>

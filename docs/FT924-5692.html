			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / International Company News: Coles Myer forced to adjourn its AGM SHAREHOLDERS in Coles Myer, Australia's biggest retailing group, yesterday adjourned the annual meeting after a dispute between the board and dissident shareholders over directors' financial interests. The move followed a confrontation between Mr Solomon Lew, chairman, and Mr Laurence Gruzman, a Sydney barrister, who had sought details of transactions involving Mr Lew's private business interests and those of other directors. Mr Peter Bartels, chief executive, said the board needed time to prepare an audited addendum to the group's accounts which would clarify a statement on directors' interests released to the Australian Stock Exchange. The statement, which followed a campaign by Mr Gruzman and the Australian Shareholders' Association, revealed that Coles Myer paid ADollars 176m (USDollars 120.25m) last year to companies associated with directors. It said the payments represented less than 1 per cent of the group's expenditure on goods and services, and were carefully monitored by independent auditors. The statement said the 'inference behind the questions' represented 'a calculated and deliberate slur on the character and integrity' of the company, its management and its professional advisers. Mr Bartels said the decision to adjourn the meeting was not an admission that the board had acted incorrectly. The group said a special meeting would be scheduled before the end of the year after the addendum had been distributed. Before the adjournment, Mr Lew said first-quarter profits were ahead of last year's results. 'We are confident that . . . we will outperform our previous year's results,' he said. Coles Myer reported net profits of ADollars 370m for the year to July 26, compared with ADollars 368m the previous year.</p>

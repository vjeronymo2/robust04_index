			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / People: London Securities eyes Hong Kong London Global Securities, the securities lending firm set up in 1990, has tempted Hans Beckmann, 30, away from Deutsche Bank to head its new Hong-Kong based subsidiary, London Global Securities (Asia). Beckmann was previously head of operations at Deutsche Bank Asset Management in Frankfurt. He will be supported in his new role by Katherine Pek, 31, formerly an operations manager with Morgan Stanley in Hong Kong. London Global Securities employs 54 people worldwide and has offices in London and Greenwich, Connecticut. Its decision to set up in Hong-Kong - just four years before the colony reverts to mainland China - was inspired by the city's strategic status amid the region's emerging markets. 'For every one who thinks 1997 is a problem, there are three who think it's an opportunity,' said Mike Hiard, managing director of the London subsidiary and one of the firm's founders.</p>

			<p><P> April 9, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CITY LINES: CRAFTED CABINET  </P> <P> The crafted cabinet of select timber and hand-hammered metal timber, designed  by Tony Stuart, opens up to form a cocktail bar. It was displayed to very good  advantage in the fifth-floor corridor of the center's Green Building by the  firm of Uniquely Australian. Its showroom wasn't quite ready but its products  were, the cabinet being one of a wide selection from Down Under. SAM HALL  KAPLAN  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 19, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CITY BASEBALL PLAYOFFS FACE QUICK DEATH IF STRIKE PERSISTS  </P> <P> The City Section's 4-A Division baseball playoffs appear dead unless the strike  against the Los Angeles Unified School District is settled by Monday, according  to City Section Commissioner Hal Harkness.  </P> <P> Two wild-card games scheduled for today have been canceled and the City's  athletic office likely will announce Monday a decision to scrap the rest of the  playoffs because of a boycott by the 4-A coaches.  </P> <P> The Cleveland-El Camino Real and Birmingham-Gardena games scheduled for today  were to determine the final two entrants in the 12-team 4-A bracket. Harkness  said that those games will not be rescheduled even if the strike is ended by  Monday, adding that El Camino Real and Gardena will advance to the first round  -- if one is played -- based on better overall records.  </P> <P> Harkness has ruled out the possibility of rescheduling the playoffs if the  strike -- and boycott -- last past Wednesday, when the 4-A playoffs are  supposed to begin. All coaches whose teams have qualified for the 4-A playoffs  voted this week to boycott the season until the strike ends. Harkness said it  seems unlikely that administrators will field teams without the coaches  present.  </P> <P> "It's my sense from most of the administrators I've talked with that nobody  wants to get involved with fill-in coaches," he said. "It looks like the 4-A  playoffs are in real jeopardy."  </P> <P> The Chatsworth administration rejected an appeal by players to field a team  even if Coach Bob Lofrano continues to boycott.  </P> <P> "Until I hear different from our supervisors, it is our position that if the  coach of record is not present, we will not provide a substitute," Assistant  Principal Roy Kawamoto said Thursday.  </P> <P> The coaches have taken their action despite a recommendation by the Los Angeles  City Coaches Assn. that would allow coaches to continue to direct their teams  after school while honoring picket lines. Postseason play in other spring  sports -- such as golf, softball, swimming, track and volleyball -- have been  unaffected by the strike.  </P> <P> That fact rankles the parents of the Palisades High baseball team, according to  Jeff Myrow, president of the school's athletic booster club. Myrow's group has  persuaded Palisades to field a team despite the absence of Coach Russ Howard,  and the group has embarked on a campaign to persuade other 4-A schools to  follow suit. So far, only Palisades has committed to play.  </P></p>

			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / Observer: Spartan welcome Karolos Papoulios, Greece's foreign minister, could be forgiven for thinking the Turks are deliberately making life uncomfortable for him. Arriving at Istanbul for yesterday's Nato meeting, he told his Turkish hosts he wished to pay his respects to the Orthodox Patriarch. But the police escort apparently mistook Fener, the official seat of the head of the Eastern Church, for Fenerbahce. Only the hasty intervention of an alert official prevented Papoulios finding himself dropped off in a run-down district best known for its football club.</p>

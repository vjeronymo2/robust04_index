			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / International Company News: Federal Express delivers Dollars 113.8m loss FEDERAL EXPRESS, the largest overnight package delivery business in the US, suffered a Dollars 113.8m loss after tax in the year to end-May. The loss was scored on revenues down from Dollars 7.69bn a year earlier to Dollars 7.55bn. FedEx, which has been incurring heavy losses from its international operations recently, made a small Dollars 5.9m profit after tax in 1990-91. However, in the previous year it reported a Dollars 115.8m surplus after tax, and Dollars 184.6m in 1989-90. In the fourth quarter of 1991-92, Federal said the overall after-tax profit totalled Dollars 35.8m, up from Dollars 31m in the same period a year earlier. But its international business remained in the red - although the operating loss from this division fell to Dollars 53.2m, on revenues of Dollars 536.1m, against a deficit of Dollars 74.6m on revenues of Dollars 633.5m a year earlier. In March, FedEx announced a withdrawal from the highly-competitive European delivery industry, sub-contracting all its intra-European delivery business and laying off more than 6,000 employees. This move, according to Federal, has succeeded in removing more fixed costs than revenue, thus aiding profitability. Express package volumes to and from Europe had been maintained at levels 'ahead of expectations'. Mr Fred Smith, Federal's founder and chairman, warned that further improvement would 'require a continuation of growth in international express package volumes and higher profit ability from international air freight business'. For 1991-92 overall, the loss from the Memphis-based company's international operations totalled Dollars 612.9m, compared with a Dollars 419.1m deficit in the previous 12 months. The former figure, however, was scored after Dollars 254m of restructuring charges, largely to cover the withdrawal from Europe. The 1990-91 loss came after charges of Dollars 121m. On the domestic front, where Federal Express carries about half the nation's overnight express packages, FedEx said the climate remained extremely price-competitive. Despite this, Federal managed an operating profit margin of 12.2 per cent, which it attributed to productivity gains and cost improvements.</p>

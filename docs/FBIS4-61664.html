			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Lyudmila Feliksova "CIS: Dead End or Way Out?"] </F>   [Text] Chisinau -- Moldova joined the CIS to wails from  the opposition about its loss of independence and about a new  form of imperial oppression. But the opposition's opinion this  year cannot influence the decisions of the ruling agrarian  majority. All the more so as it is no secret that those who  shout loudest about the loss of the Republic's independence are  least interested in it. They mainly support unification with  Romania and see Moldova's membership of the CIS as yet another  major obstacle in the way of implementing their cherished dream  of becoming part of the neighboring state.    But the CIS issue cannot be seen merely in black and white  terms. It is much more complicated. The opponents also include  people who have no desire to join Romania but who are worried  that such a powerful country as Russia will dictate its  political and economic will and turn Moldova into its satellite.    "That is the mentality in small countries," economist A.  Muravskiy [name as transliterated], an agrarian deputy, told me.  "They differ from big countries in being more sensitive to any  infringement of their rights in a partnership."    Also cautious about the CIS are the so-called "Westerners,"  who see the cure to all their ills as lying in the opposite  direction to the east. But many economists believe that it will  be impossible for the Republic to break into the Western market  in the immediate future. At any rate, the first two months of  this year cannot be called a success. Relations with the far  abroad are as follows -- the Republic's imports exceeded its  exports fourfold. And the bulk of these shipments were paid for  with hard currency. Is it possible in this situation to  seriously talk about entering the Western market or at least of  balancing foreign trade?    Paradoxically, it will be easier for Moldova to team up with  the West by going through the eastern market. So, whichever way  you slice it -- whether it be tough or desirable -- the CIS is a  necessity for Moldova. On the basis of the results of the first  two months of the year the CIS countries account for around 75  percent of Moldova's foreign trade turnover. And the main  country is Russia. It accounts for almost 62 percent, and is  followed by Ukraine (6.5 percent) and Belorussia [Belarus] (2.3  percent). But even here Moldova's trade is by no means in the  black. Its deficit is 137 million lei. Under the corresponding  article of the treaty, CIS membership means for Moldova freer  movement of goods, services, money, and labor, coordination of  its monetary, credit, and fiscal policy, and more acceptable  customs duties -- and, consequently, prices for goods.    But this decision -- long-awaited by some and undesirable  for  others -- will not of itself make things any easier overnight.  This is already clear even to the most convinced supporters of  the Commonwealth, who have lived through the period of naive  romanticism when it had seemed that it would be enough to sign  the treaty and the economic wheel would move toward  stabilization. The political train, crushing the old economy  underneath it, has gone a long way. Whether forward or backward  -- only time will tell, but there is no doubt that other  realities have emerged. Just as something else is obvious too.  The new economy to back up those realities has not yet emerged.  We are merely calculating our losses. Moldova remains without  any industry. Whereas a few years ago industry accounted for 67  percent when it came to forming the budget, last year it  accounted for just 9.3 percent. And the slump has not been  halted.    It will hardly be possible to rapidly restore our broken  ties. And Moldovan Prime Minister A. Sangheli sees their loss as  one of the main causes of the current crisis.</p>

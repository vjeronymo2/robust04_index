It will  involve taking air, water, and soil samples on a 500-meter  radius around the national smelting enterprise.    This work has been designed for the first phase of the  environmental control program, with backing from the German  Government, whose investment will amount to 10 million German  marks (approximately $7.5 million), to be completed by fiscal  year 1994.    The environmental control plan will make it possible to  learn  the real pollution levels, and will serve as a basic factor for  future environmental control regulations on the national level,  according to Rene Candia Trigo, general manager of the smelting  complex.    He explained that the results of the study being made will  soon afford the opportunity to achieve regulations for  environmental control based on a detailed analysis, and taking  all the studies conducted thus far into account.    He claimed that the environmental control program is the  metallurgical enterprise's top priority, noting that they are  waiting to hear the first results of the evaluation, so as to  continue with that program. He maintained that the latter would  make it possible to guarantee a production "without pollution,  while protecting the population's health."    He added that this work was begun based on the commitment  assumed by the mining secretary, Jaime Villalobos, to deal with  the region's problem and to provide an opportunity for making  environmental audits in the area of environmental pollution,  using Oruro as a pilot city.</p>

			<p><P> November 22, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> BRONZE TRIBUTE TO JFK'S SPIRIT  </P> <P> Sculptor Isabel McIlvain is closing in on the moment of truth for her  8-foot-tall portrayal of John F. Kennedy.  </P> <P> Her clay statue is about to be cast in bronze, the final step before its  unveiling outside the Massachusetts Capitol as the formal memorial to a beloved  native son.  </P> <P> For older generations, the heroic image will recall the optimism and vigor  embodied by Kennedy. For generations born since the young President was slain  on Nov. 22, 1963, the statue offers a glimpse of the era known as Camelot.  </P> <P> "My wish is to portray somebody who was a magnetic leader and who had a lot of  youth, a lot of hope about his role and the possibilities for America," said  McIlvain, a professor of sculpture at Boston University. McIlvain's work, which  will take about six months to cast, depicts Kennedy in a classic pose --  striding into a breeze, eyes forward, elbows bent with his left hand tucked  into his suit pocket. The finished $175,000 sculpture, which has been paid for  through donations from citizens' groups and schoolchildren, is scheduled for  unveiling May 29, which would have been Kennedy's 72nd birthday.  </P></p>

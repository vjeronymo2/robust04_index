The Contract Reform Team was charged with a review of a broad range of contracting issues, including the management and operation of DOE weapons production facilities and national laboratories, support service contracting, and environmental restoration activities, consistent with the Department's changing mission.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Contract Reform Team conducted a thorough analysis of the Department's contracting practices and provided a list of specific recommendations to the Secretary regarding administrative, financial, and regulatory improvements that are intended to increase contractor accountability, enhance competition, provide appropriate incentives for contractors to meet and exceed performance criteria and achieve cost savings, and improve contract administration and financial accountability.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department is strongly committed to the President's and Vice President's efforts to reinvent Government and recognizes that reforming DOE's contracting practices is critical to our success.

Following consideration of stakeholder views, the Department intends to proceed with the implementation phase of its contract reform initiative.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Issued in Washington, DC, on February 11, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> William H.

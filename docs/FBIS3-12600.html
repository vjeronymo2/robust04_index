Addressing the Security Council last night, Syrian UN  Representative Husayn 'Awwad said Israel's intransigent attitude  and expansionist policies, which have persisted since the start  of the Middle East peace talks in Madrid in 1991, are either  directly or indirectly responsible for regional extremism. He  added that Israel has been playing a dual game since the start  of the Middle East peace process and that the Hebron massacre is  part of an organized and planned operation, not an individual  act as asserted by Israel. The government of Israel bears  responsibility for this massacre, he added.    'Awwad said that unless the United States and Russia, the  cosponsors of the peace process, intervene for the sake of  reaching a just, lasting, and comprehensive solution in the  Middle East, Israel will then implement Yitzhaq Shamir's  slogans, which he summed up in the following phrase: Negotiate  with the Arabs for years, but do not allow these talks to  produce any results.</p>

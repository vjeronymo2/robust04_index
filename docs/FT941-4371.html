			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / Leading Article: Turkish terror Turkey is floundering. The currency has collapsed. Inflation has only been held at about 70 per cent by control of public sector prices, and is expected to hit triple figures before the end of the year. The government has financed a consumer boom by reckless borrowing, ahead of local elections to be held on March 27. Even so, the True Path party of prime minister Tansu Ciller is running third in the opinion polls, behind the Refah (or 'welfare') party which advocates, as openly as it can get away with, a reversal of Turkey's 70-year-old secular revolution. Worst of all, a vicious civil war is raging in the south-east which shows signs of spreading to the rest of the country, and could even destroy Turkey's still fragile democracy. More than 10,000 people have died since it began in 1984. In their increasingly desperate attempts to counter the terrorism of the Kurdish Workers' party (PKK), Turkey's security forces have resorted to counter-terror. A month ago the English-language Turkish Daily News published a list of 874 villages and hamlets in the south-east which have been forcibly evacuated, some being burnt to the ground to prevent their inhabitants returning. Last month five army cadets were killed by a bomb at Tuzla railway station, near Istanbul. In apparent revenge, the Ankara headquarters of the Democracy party (DEP) - seen by some Turks as playing Sinn Fein to the PKK's IRA - were bombed. One person was killed. Mr Hatip Dicle, the DEP leader, refused to condemn the Tuzla bombing: it was an act of war, he said. This outraged many Turks, and in particular the armed forces chief of staff, General Dogan Gures, who de-scribed the DEP's 17 deputies as 'outlaws in parliament' and 'traitors'. Apparently taking her cue from the chief of staff, Mrs Ciller called for a vote on long-standing demands for the lifting of the parliamentary immunity of Mr Dicle and seven other deputies. Last week this was adopted; the deputies were seized by security forces as they left the parliament building, and are now in detention. Seven of them face charges of separatism which potentially carry the death penalty, though in all but one case these relate to things they have said rather than anything they are alleged to have done. Turkey will not solve its Kurdish problem by such methods. It can do so only if the state addresses the grievances which the PKK exploits. Kurds should be given the right to education and broadcasting in their own language. They should be allowed to form their own political parties, choosing their own programmes, as an alternative to violence. And they must be freed from the terror of the security forces. Unhappily, since the death of President Turgut Ozal last April, there seems to be no Turkish leader with the strength or the courage to propose a solution on these lines.</p>

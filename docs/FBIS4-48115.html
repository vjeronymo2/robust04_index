			<p>BFN     [Text] Johannesburg May 11 SAPA -- The Independent  Electoral Commission [IEC] is in the process of wrapping up its  operations and some staff members have already left. IEC  spokesman Pieter Cronje said on Wednesday [11 May] a better  indication on how long it would take to wrap up the process  would probably be determined by Thursday.    The IEC would stop working only once its disbanding had been  proclaimed by the president in the government gazette, he said.    The task being tackled at the moment was financial  reconciliation. The IEC has to submit all its financial records  to the auditor-general for a final audit as soon as possible.  Mr Cronje said extra costs incurred after the preliminary  budget had been released had to be tallied.    These costs included spending related to the Inkatha Freedom  Party's participation in the elections, the extra day of voting  in some areas and the printing of additional ballot papers.  "This is a big operation," Mr Cronje said. IEC financial staff  would probably stay on until the end of the month.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] In connection with the issue of opening the  Japanese mobile phone market, the U.S. Government has confirmed  that Japan had violated the Japan-U.S. Telecommunications  Agreement. Commenting on the U.S. Government's action at a news  conference on 17 February, Futoshi Shirai, administrative vice  minister of the Posts and Telecommunications Ministry, said: "I  have heard the Japan Mobile Communications Company, which is in  charge of handling American mobile phone companies, has done  what it can do for them. I think that Japan has no means left to  deal with the issue." In this way, he expressed his pessimism  about avoiding U.S. sanctions.    At the news conference, the administrative vice minister  also  said that the Japan-U.S. negotiations were set to be held on the  morning of 15 February at the request of the U.S. side, but the  negotiations were delayed until after U.S. Trade Representative  Kantor's news conference, and lashed out at the way the United  States has dealt with the issue in bilateral negotiations,  saying, "My feeling is that the United States intended from the  beginning to confirm Japan's violation."    Masahito Tani, deputy minister of the Posts and  Telecommunications Ministry, returned to Japan on 17 February  after holding talks with Deputy U.S. Trade Representative  Barshevsky on the issue of opening the Japanese mobile phone  market. Speaking at a news conference that day, he expressed the  grim view that negotiations cannot be held under the present  circumstances, saying: "We will not comply with any request from  the United States for the resumption of negotiations under the  threat that it may resort to the process of imposing sanctions  against Japan. At the present stage, the issue cannot be  resolved politically."</p>

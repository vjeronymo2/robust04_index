			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / Money Markets: Shortage taken out THREAT of revolution in Russia left Britain's domestic financial concerns in a very parochial light yesterday. Consequently short sterling was sidelined while the Bank of England's operations proceeded effortlessly writes Peter John. The week started with a continuation of the recent tradition of heavy cash shortages, which have been the result of the government's unusually large funding programme. A shortfall of over Pounds 1bn has become the norm and yesterday's early forecast of Pounds 1.05bn came well below some bank estimates. Contrary to the tight conditions of the past few days there was such a willingness to meet the shortage that overnight money rates, sometimes squeezed as high as 8 per cent in recent weeks, fell as low as 3 per cent. As one dealer said: 'You can't get much lower than that without giving it away.' Increased liquidity in the market was underlined by the high level of bills for repurchase which were expected to drain Pounds 1.84bn from the system. Added to these were Treasury bills and paper maturing in official hands, which were expected to drain Pounds 1.21bn. Partly offsetting these, Exchequer transactions added Pounds 1.03bn, a fall in note circulation injected Pounds 900m and bankers' balances above target added Pounds 80m. Most of the shortage was dealt with early in the day with the central bank providing the money market with Pounds 900m of early assistance via bills for resale to the market on October 25 at an established 5 29/32 per cent. Later the bank provided an extra Pounds 100m. In the afternoon, the shortage was revised to Pounds 1.31bn and the central bank provided a further Pounds 315m. Short sterling traded within a very narrow range, opening at 94.35 and ending the day only three basis points higher at 94.38 on turnover of just under 11,000 contracts. The December contract was already discounting a cut of almost half a percentage point off the base rate and dealers are expected to hold it at current levels until the November budget unless a change is announced sooner. German call money was steady at around 6.95 per cent as the market gradually steadied after a cash crunch late last week, which had been relieved by the injection of extra short-term funds by the Bundesbank.</p>

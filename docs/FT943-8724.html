			<p>940816 FT  16 AUG 94 / Portillo firm over effect of EU rule The prospect of a government climbdown on employment for the disabled was receding last night after Mr Michael Portillo, employment secretary, said he could see no legal basis for the reinstatement of the priority suppliers scheme. Mr Portillo, who withdrew government departments from the scheme last week, said he had asked the European Commission how the scheme could be reconciled with an EU directive on public procurement which took effect in July. He said: 'I would like to keep the scheme if I can, but my legal advisers tell me that it is just unlawful to maintain it since this new directive. That legal advice is absolutely unambiguous.' The commission urged the government to work with Brussels to find a way of reconciling the scheme with the directive, which was not intended to affect disabled workers. Commission officials said they were bemused by the government's interpretation of the directive, which was approved with British support in June last year when Mr David Hunt was employment secretary. They said Britain had not raised the impact of the directive on the scheme, which allows companies employing mainly disabled workers to make a second bid for government contracts to match the winning tender. The issue was not discussed by ministers during the negotiations over the directive, which took place when Mr Portillo was chief secretary to the Treasury. British officials threw doubt on the commission's claims that the decision to withdraw government support for the scheme came as a complete surprise. Mr Martin Bangemann, the industry commissioner, is understood to have written last week to Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, informing the government that the commission was investigating the legality of the scheme. Mr Portillo said the government would not accept a compromise such as agreement by the commission to 'turn a blind eye' to the continuation of the scheme. He said such a compromise would leave the government open to an action in the European Court of Justice by aggrieved competitors of companies employing disabled workers. He added: 'The commission is not the European Court of Justice. They don't decide what the law is, neither is it the policeman of European law. So whatever they say about the intentions of the directive is irrelevant.' The demise of the scheme puts the jobs of thousands of disabled workers at risk, although companies will still be eligible for subsidies of up to Pounds 10,000 per job. Remploy, the biggest company involved, has 8,736 disabled workers in 95 factories.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 9 (XINHUA) -- Japan's coalition  government ended a closed-door meeting today without reaching a  decision on the choice of a new prime minister to replace  Morihiro Hosokawa who announced his shock resignation yesterday.    However, leaders of the ruling coalition, attending the  session without Hosokawa, said they have agreed in principle to  form a new government within one week and pick a new leader.    Hosokawa refused to predict who will be his successor,  saying  that it is imprudent to name the next premier, or even to take  part in discussions to name him.    Meanwhile, Tsutomu Hata, deputy prime minister and foreign  minister, is widely viewed here as the most possible successor  to Hosokawa.    The opposition Liberal Democratic Party, who governed for  nearly four decades until they were toppled by Hosokawa's  coalition last year, were trying to determine if the unexpected  turn of events would give them a chance to again seize control.    There has also been speculation that former Foreign Minister  Michio Watanabe could defect from the Liberal Democrats,  bringing his faction into the coalition and making a bid for its  leadership and thus the prime ministership.    Hosokawa, the 56-year-old prime minister who took office  last  August, stepped down amid mounting pressure over alleged past  financial improprieties.    Debate over the scandal has blocked parliamentary business  for the past month, halting work on the budget for this fiscal  year and other issues.    During his eight-month term as premier, Hosokawa achieved  political reform and helped conclude the Uruguay Round of  multilateral trade talks under the General Agreement on Tariffs  and Trade.    However, he has yet not finished such jobs as tax and  pension  reforms, decentralization and greater transparency of government  operations.</p>

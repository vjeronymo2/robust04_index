			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Address by President Liamine Zeroual at workers' rally in </F> Dar ech-Chaab on 23 February -- recorded]    [Excerpts] In the name of God the Merciful and the  Compassionate, Brothers Algerian workers, Sisters Algerian  workers, I greet you and through you I greet all Algerian male  and female workers inside and outside the homeland.    We are meeting today to commemorate the annual anniversary  of  the General Union of Algerian Workers and the anniversary of the  recovery of the national wealth. On this occasion I  congratulate all male and female workers. [passage omitted]    We are celebrating this anniversary while Algeria is  tackling  its many-faceted crisis, including the economic crisis. We are  aware that the first ones affected by this crisis are the  workers, the people on low income, and the most deprived social  groups. The economic stagnation has led for years to an  increase of unemployment and shortage of investments. This has  added to the difficulty of living conditions.    I take this opportunity to salute our workers who face the  difficulty of this situation with patience and wisdom deserving  all appreciation and without abandoning their duty of  safeguarding the national economy and without surrendering to  the provocations or the political one-upmanships coming from  several quarters. [passage omitted]    We are following with interest the situation of other  countries that went through this experiment; we are aware of the  economic and social pitfalls that went hand in hand with these  experiments; and this prompts us neither to worship nor imitate  any experiment; we do not give any preference to one over  another.    We are aware that no matter how strong the capabilities of  liberalism may be, they remain limited like any other economic  choices. If easing the negative sides of the market economy  does happen only through a genuine mobilization of the nation's  cadres, and the establishment of a real program for national  solidarity; this factor also takes places via the support of the  state, the bolstering of its capabilities to defend the most  needy classes, the presence of a scientific management of  resources, and an increase of national production.    In this field, we aim to strengthen the state; and at the  same time support dialogue and social consultation, because the  Algerian state belongs to all Algerians; it is the state of law;  it is there to serve the people in its entirely.    However, we should reiterate that the state is not and will  not be lenient with those who work for the destruction of the  country and the sabotage of its economic capabilities. In these  circumstances, the workers are called upon to mobilize  themselves and show vigilance to defend their institutions  against acts of sabotage.    Brothers and sisters, if we want to meet the challenge,  first  of all we should rediscover the value of work and the value of  efforts and efficiency; rewards should be based on this  criterion alone. Here, we should be frank, we have squandered a  great deal of precious time because of absenteeism and because  of management negligence; because of wastage and mismanagement  in production; and an exaggerated usage of the right to strike.    Reviving the national economy, upon which depends the  stability and equilibrium of society, falls within the tasks  that await us all: namely, the restoration of security, the  eradication of violence, the underpinning of the state's  structure, the imposition of the rule of law by the competent  authorities, the introduction of profound reforms to the state  administration, and opening the door of opportunity for youth  and capable cadres. All of these actions are seeking to renew  the system of the country in a comprehensive way.    In the next few weeks the economic and social council will  be  installed where members of various walks of life in the society  will meet to discuss the issues and submit proposals in their  respect to the executive authorities.    We are convinced that the trade union organization  represented by the general union of Algerian workers will play a  significant role in these consultations.    In the political field we stand by the consultation and the  wide participation and by the serious dialogue with all national  political forces which abide by the constitution and reject the  use of violence. [passage omitted]    Brothers and sisters, in conclusion I reiterate  congratulations to the Algerian workers, and I call on them once  again to be mobilized and vigilant and to work more and be more  united and defend the future and the destiny of the country.    May God make us all successful, and may God's peace and  blessings be upon you.</p>

			<p><P> November 11, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> NEW YORK;  </P> <P> YONKERS MAYORAL RACE UP IN THE AIR  </P> <P> Surprising numbers that turned up during verification of the vote count in the  Yonkers, N.Y., mayoral race cast doubt on the results of the bitter election,  apparently won by an opponent of court-ordered housing desegregation. With five  of the city's 12 wards recounted, officials said Democratic incumbent Nicholas  Wasicsko had picked up 1,663 votes, cutting by more than a third the margin by  which he trailed Republican Henry Spallone. The election was basically a  referendum on the housing-desegregation issue, with Spallone urging continued  defiance of the court-ordered plan and Wasicsko calling for compliance. The  canvass of votes was suspended Friday for Veterans Day and was to resume  Monday.  </P></p>

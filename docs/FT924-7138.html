			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / Money market takes a long view DEALERS in the sterling money-market have started to change their views on the direction which UK base rates are taking. Some suggested yesterday that their views might have significant implications for banks' balance sheets. When the Bank of England signalled cuts on September 22 and October 16, the market's view was that there was more monetary easing to come before the end of the year. One-month and three-month money tended to be below base rates, sometimes by as much as a full percentage point. Since Friday's cut, however, money-market rates have taken a different direction. The offered rates for one-month and three-month money rose yesterday to around 7 5/16 per cent, above the base-rate figure of 7 per cent. Dealers are taking the view that Friday's base-rate cut may have been the last this year. The clearing banks were adamant yesterday that the higher cost of borrowing money in the wholesale market had no impact on the rates at which they lend to private customers and businesses. The head of asset management at one of the big four clearing banks said the higher cost of borrowing sterling could be met through operations in the wholesale market. He said that, at worst, the higher costs might affect a few building societies which relied heavily on the wholesale sector. Recent movements in wholesale money-market rates may, however, affect the banks in other ways: The fall in money-market rates reduces the returns to banks from holding current-account deposits. Banks earn money by re-depositing cash in these accounts in the wholesale market. Clearing-bank officials said, however, that any potential losses will have been offset by the build-up of fixed-interest portfolios or the purchase of gilts. Although the market still assumes that base rates will be cut to around 6 per cent within a year, cash rates beyond that are indicating a sharp rise in interest rates. The rate for five-year money yesterday was 7.64 per cent, while 10-year rates were at 8.57 per cent. The rising yield curve may affect the rates at which banks offer fixed-rate mortgages.</p>

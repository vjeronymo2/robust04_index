			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets: South African gold shares advance on rise in bullion Gold shares in Johannesburg improved sharply following a rise in bullion above Dollars 380 an ounce. However, industrials lacked direction, while there was steady interest in De Beers, up R3.25 at R112.25. The overall index rose 56 to 5,518, industrials 6 to 6,545 and golds 56 to 1,979. Among other movers, Anglos added R6 at R227.50 and JCI was 50 cents better at R95.50. Remgro depressed the industrial index with a 75-cent fall to R26.75 on fears that it could suffer from possible taxes on cigarettes and alcohol. Gencor appreciated 5 cents to R10.70, Richemont slipped 25 cents to R39.50 in good volume and Minorco moved ahead R4.50 to R111. Absa shed 15 cents to R8.70 as its strong showing of the past week ran out of steam, although dealers said the market remained positive about its prospects. In golds, Kloof climbed R3 to R50.50 and Vaal Reefs R11 to R401. The Council of Southern African Banks said yesterday that it had rejected recommendations for an evolutionary restructuring of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, and warned that without full deregulation a rival exchange could be set up. The council said that without full deregulation there would be 'no option but to apply for a licence to establish a rival stock exchange'. The move followed the JSE's release of its restructuring proposals last month.</p>

			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / International Company News: European operations slip further into the red FORD'S European operations fell deeper into the red in the second quarter, and Mr Harold Poling, the chairman and chief executive, warned that there could be a further deterioration. The second-quarter net loss of Dollars 175m compared with a profit of Dollars 23m in the same period of 1992. Jaguar, Ford's UK-based luxury cars subsidiary, made a second-quarter loss of Dollars 59.1m, although this represented a considerable improvement on a year-ago loss of Dollars 72.5m. Ford projected total European car and truck sales this year would fall 17 per cent to 12.4m. This has almost ruled out breaking even on European operations this year. Market conditions have continued to worsen since the first quarter, when the European operations, including Jaguar, made a net loss of Dollars 82m compared with a Dollars 84m profit in the previous year's quarter. Since Jaguar's losses in the first quarter were Dollars 150.5m, down from Dollars 242m in the same period in 1992, Ford's non-Jaguar European business was marginally in profit in the opening stages of this year. However, the European new car market has since slid further and Ford's share of it has contracted. Its cars accounted for 11.3 per cent of all European sales in the second quarter, compared with 11.5 per cent in the first. The worsening of Ford's fortunes showed up sharply in second-quarter unit sales in Germany, Europe's single biggest market, which dropped by 19.8 per cent to 219,185. UK sales fell more than 21 per cent to 117,405. However, Ford said it had been hit by adverse currency shifts within Europe and by higher product and marketing costs. It has also had to bear the launch costs of the Mondeo medium car range, one of the most important models in its history. Mr Poling said more than 250,000 orders for the Mondeo had been received since its launch in March.</p>

In the statement they shared the view that they should fight  it out to prevent the agricultural market opening which would  drive the South Korean agriculture into bankruptcy, and urged  the authorities to leave unfilled blanks of the final plan for  the enforcement of the opening which was due to be submitted by  February 15.    They also declared that they would fight in concert to  prevent a "parliamentary ratification" of the agro-market  opening.</p>

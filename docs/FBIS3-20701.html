			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Brendan McNally: "Local Fruit Trader Sets Sights </F> High With Offer for Czech Aircraft Giant"]    [Text] A businessman who has found success selling fruit  and vegetables in Russia says he wants to save the Czech  aviation industry by buying it lock, stock and barrel.    Frantisek Houska, owner and general director of the FrutOvo  produce company, is offering to buy out Aero, the crisis-ridden  company that controls nearly all of the Czech aircraft industry,  for $600 million U.S. in order "to keep it together."    Houska claims to have assembled a team of industry experts  who he says can help put Aero back on its feet. What he wants is  for the government and Investicni banka, the company's largest  creditor, to freeze the sale of Aero's assets and daughter  companies for six months. Houska believes he can get the  financing to purchase the company put together by June.    Houska's offer comes at a time when the Czech Privatization  Ministry is saying that Aero should be put into receivership,  given that it owes at least 1.7 billion Kc [Czech korunas] ($51  million) to Investicni banka.    For the past several weeks, Investicni has been threatening  to force Aero into bankruptcy, following a decision by the  National Property Fund that overturned the bank's acquisition of  a 30 percent share in Aero through a debt-equity swap.    Aero spokesman Zdenek Burian would give no comment on  FrutOvo's bid. He said negotiations are continuing between Aero  and Investicni banka, which is calling for an immediate  settlement of debts.    Houska says the Czech aviation industry is being gutted by  its management, which is selling off assets and funneling the  money into its own pockets or paying off bills to the banks. As  a result, Houska charges, those in management are only  interested in selling airplanes if it means profit for  themselves.    "What is going on right now is not good," Houska says. "It  would be a terrible thing if the Czech aviation industry were  destroyed. It will affect the entire nation and all of Czech  industry."    FrutOvo is a Prague-based company that, since being founded  in 1988, has reportedly made millions of dollars selling fruit  and vegetables in the former Soviet Union. FrutOvo now owns 29  companies, including a grocery chain and a parts importing house  for Russian Lada automobiles.    It briefly attracted media attention last September when  Investicni banka listed it as one of two companies interested in  buying the Prague-based engine manufacturer Motorlet, one of  four Aero subsidiaries the bank had sent to the auction block.    FrutOvo's only competitor at the time was the Canadian  aircraft engine maker Pratt &amp; Whitney. Critics of the firm  charge that it wants to buy Motorlet in order to shut it down  and sell off its assets while gaining its market share.    "I cannot see any other reason Pratt &amp; Whitney would be  interested in Motorlet," says Michal Kraus, a leading member of  the Social Democratic Party bloc in parliament. Kraus has called  for establishing a parliamentary commission to examine the  collapse of the Czech aircraft industry. "They [Pratt &amp;  Whitney]  have had to lay off 50 percent of their own work force. I don't  think it would go over very well in Canada if they started doing  production over here."    Houska says he decided to buy Aero in its entirety after  learning that Aero had been privatized in a way that would allow  it to hold on to its subsidiaries. He sees no point in trying to  buy up one of the companies, as he attempted to do with Motorlet.    "When they privatized [Motorlet], they let Aero keep the  title to the land where the factory stands," he complains. "So  you win the competition in dollars and then you find out that  they forgot to tell you that when it was divided into daughter  companies, they continued to keep ownership of the land. `Yes,  we can sell you the factory,' they'll say, `but not the land.'  Then you're going to have to pay them rent."    The winner has not yet been announced in the Motorlet  competition. Even though he says he offered 40 million Kc more  than the competition, Houska believes the bid will probably go  to Pratt &amp; Whitney. "I heard they were offering $10 million  for  Motorlet," he says. If they do win the competition, Houska says,  Pratt &amp; Whitney will "have the Eastern market all to  themselves."</p>

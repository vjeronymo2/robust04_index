			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / Brussels hits at generator over coal contracts National Power, the UK's largest generator, appears to be discriminating against small, private-sector companies in five-year coal contracts concluded last March, the European Commission's competition directorate says. Preliminary findings in an investigation by the directorate say National Power is not justified in imposing a 10.5p per gigajoule difference between prices it pays to state-owned British Coal and independent companies. A confidential report by the directorate also finds that National Power discriminates against opencast operators and in favour of deep mines in allocating tonnages to private-sector operators. National Power said yesterday it could not comment in detail on a report which was not public. But it said it was confident that, when it had given a full explanation, the commission would accept its position. If the commission confirms its findings, the small operators are likely to push for redress through the British courts. The High Court is due to hear tomorrow and Thursday a separate dispute involving National Power and South Wales and Monmouthsire Small Mines Association over earlier contracts. In the dispute involving National Power's existing five-year contracts with independent producers, the commission's preliminary view says that the small miners and blenders, who mix varying grades of coal, have been treated at least as favourably as British Coal in the allocation of tonnages when they are taken as a whole. But it finds that National Power has disriminated in favour first of the blenders and then the deep mines, both at the expense of the opencast operators. The report notes the commission has accepted the principle of a differential between the price paid by generators to British Coal and independent operators. This is because of additional costs associated with transport, sulphur and investment when dealing with independent coal. The commission's preliminary view is that the 10.5p gap is not entirely justified but says it needs additional information to determine what the differential should be. It suggest the maximum should be 6.5p per gigajoule. In a review of the commission's ruling, UK Coal, an FT newsletter, says National Power may feel aggrieved in the ruling since it had done more to protect the interest of private miners than other generators. However, the differentials looked difficult to justify.</p>

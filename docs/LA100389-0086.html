			<p><P> October 3, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE: POLONIA SENTENCED TO 60 DAYS IN JAIL  </P> <P> Luis Polonia, New York Yankee outfielder, was sentenced to 60 days in jail and  fined $1,500 Monday on the misdemeanor charge of having sex with a 15-year-old  girl.  </P> <P> Thomas Doherty, Milwaukee County circuit judge, also ordered Polonia to make a  $10,000 contribution to the Sinai Samaritan Medical Center's sexual assault  treatment center in Milwaukee.  </P> <P> Polonia, who pleaded no contest in August to the charge of having sexual  intercourse with a child, will report Wednesday to begin his sentence.  </P> <P> Polonia probably will have work release privileges.  </P> <P> "I made a mistake and I'm really sorry for it," Polonia told the judge before  the sentence was imposed. "I'm a human being and anybody can make the mistake I  made."  </P> <P> Doherty said that although Polonia's relationship with the girl was consensual,  the purpose of the law is to protect the naive "from predators, if you will.  </P> <P> "Not to impose some jail sentence would diminish the significance of this  incident," Doherty said.  </P> <P> The judge said he hoped the sentence would send a message to young men like  Polonia who travel around the country "to think twice, three or four times and  then not do it."  </P> <P> Polonia, who was traded from Oakland to New York during the season, could have  received a maximum penalty of nine months in jail and $10,000 in fines.  </P></p>

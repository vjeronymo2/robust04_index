			<p><P> February 24, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TROJANS NOTCH 2ND WIN IN 3 GAMES;  </P> <P> THEY HOLD QUINNETT TO 9 POINTS AND BEAT COUGARS, 78-63  </P> <P> George Raveling, USC's basketball coach, has maintained that his team isn't as  bad as it is perceived to be. Maybe Raveling was correct in his assessment of  the Trojans.  </P> <P> USC, which defeated Washington State, 78-63, Thursday night at the Sports  Arena, is ending its season on a positive note. After winning their first home  game since Dec. 13, the Trojans received a standing ovation from the crowd of  1,827.  </P> <P> "It feels good to win a home game," forward Calvin Banks said. "Actually, it  feels good to win any game."  </P> <P> Losers of 13 straight games during one stretch, the Trojans have now won two of  their last three.  </P> <P> "I tell you one thing, I definitely nominate that game for one of the longest  of the season," Raveling said. "That was a two-hour second half. 'Gone With The  Wind' didn't last that long. I thought we were going to serve breakfast."  </P> <P> USC's defense contained Brian Quinnett, Washington State's star forward.  </P> <P> Quinnett, who scored 44 points in the Cougars' 72-65 win over the Trojans last  month at Pullman, Wash., was held to nine points. It was only the second time  this season that he hasn't scored in double figures.  </P> <P> "Quinnett didn't shoot the ball well and that's not like him," Washington State  Coach Kelvin Sampson said. "We depend on him so much. We competed well, but we  don't have very many other weapons."  </P> <P> The Trojans played defense in relays on Quinnett, who made just three of 15  field goals, including a three-point shot. Center Chris Munk and Banks started  out on him, but they got help from Andy Olivarez and Ken Countryman.  </P> <P> "We wanted to make life as difficult as possible for Quinnett," Raveling said.  "We kept them out of their tempo, pressured their guards and kept the ball away  from Quinnett."  </P> <P> The Trojans dispatched the Cougars with ease, leading by as many as 19 points.  </P> <P> Forward Chris Moore led the Trojans with a career-high 26 points, and forward  Ronnie Coleman scored 15 points before fouling out.  </P> <P> Washington State has not won a road game since beating Eastern Kentucky on Dec.  29 in the Toledo Holiday tournament. They have lost six straight road games and  are 1-8 on the road this season.  </P> <P> Harold Wright led WSU with 16 points, and Reco Rowe had 13 off the bench.  </P> <P> USC is 9-18 overall and 2-13 in the Pac-10. Washington State fell to 8-16 and  3-12.  </P> <P> Trojan Notes  </P> <P> After being benched for the second half of Monday night's 68-52 loss to  Stanford, Trojan guard Anthony Pendleton was benched against Washington State.  USC Coach George Raveling said he didn't use Pendleton because the player  failed to follow instructions. Although he's the Trojans' third leading scorer,  Pendleton has been ineffective on defense. . . . Forward Alan Pollard suffered  a right hip pointer when he was knocked down while going after a rebound in the  first half. The injury is expected to sideline him for Saturday's game against  Washington. . . . Raveling plans to start USC's graduating seniors -- Rich  Grande, Andy Olivarez and Chris Moore -- in the Trojans' final home game of the  season against the Huskies. . . . Washington State faces UCLA Sunday afternoon  at Pauley Pavilion.  </P></p>

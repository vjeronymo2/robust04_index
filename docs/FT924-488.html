			<p>921224 FT  24 DEC 92 / Government Bonds: Strong rally in index-linked gilts enables Bank to sell tap stocks UK government bonds closed higher, with the index-linked sector continuing to show strong gains due to expectations that real yields in the European bond markets will fall. The rally enabled the Bank of England to sell some of its tap stocks. Three tap stocks were exhausted yesterday - the Pounds 250m tranche of 9 per cent conventional gilt due 2008 (announced on December 11), the Pounds 150m tranche of 2 1/2 per cent index-linked stock due 2009, and the Pounds 150m tranche of 2 1/2 per cent index-linked gilt due 2024. The 2 1/2 per cent index-linked stock due 2024 rose from 102.00 to 102 13/16 , while among conventional stocks, the 9 3/4 per cent gilt rose from 109 1/16 to 109 3/8 . EUROPEAN government bond markets continued to strengthen on the back of comments by Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the president of the Bundesbank. Mr Schlesinger was reported on Tuesday as saying that German long-term yields could drop below 6 per cent during the current cycle of falling rates. The comments fuelled hopes of lower interest rates across Europe. German government bonds ended slightly firmer, with the Liffe bund future contract trading at 92.53 by late afternoon, against 92.49 at the opening. News that the cost of living for former West Germany rose 0.2 per cent in December from November, to give a year-on-year increase of 3.8 per cent, had little impact on the market, dealers said, as the figure was in line with expectations. US Treasuries eased slightly yesterday as trading wound down for the Christmas holidays and participants reacted to a disappointing afternoon auction of five-year notes. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  1/8 at 103 7/32 , yielding 7.351 per cent, and the two-year note was down 1/16 at 99 29/32 , to yield 4.658 per cent.</p>

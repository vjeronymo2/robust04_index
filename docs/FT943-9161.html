			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / International Company News: Veba maintains growth with 30% rise at midterm Veba, the energy-based conglomerate, has continued its profits drive with a 30 per cent increase in first-half pre-tax earnings. Following the 18.5 per cent rise in the first quarter, Germany's second-biggest electricity provider yesterday repeated earlier forecasts of a significantly improved result for the full year. Revitalised by restructuring in its chemicals divisions, and reinforced with new electricity operations in east Germany, Veba earned DM1bn (Dollars 600m) in the review period on sales up just 7 per cent to DM35.5bn. The interim result, published in a shareholders' letter yesterday, included a DM120m provision for a further cost-cutting programme in the chemicals sector, launched in May. Including the closure of rubber production plant, the action is intended to reduce annual labour costs by DM300m. Measures already taken led to a considerable improvement in operating results from chemicals, the letter said, although the extraordinary items meant the half-year figure remained negative. At the end of the review period the chemicals divisions employed 32,430, some 14 per cent fewer than at the end of 1993. Total deliveries from the Huls chemicals division rose 15 per cent, or 10 per cent after adjustment for consolidations and disposals. In common with most other German chemicals makers, Veba reported most volume increases going to foreign customers. Domestic deliveries rose only slightly, it said. Turnover from electricity increased 29 per cent to DM8bn, due to the inclusion of majority stakes in five regional utilities in the former East Germany. Earnings rose by an undisclosed amount. Power deliveries from the PreussenElektra subsidiary rose 20 per cent due to the acquisitions, while deliveries in the west showed above-average growth of 1.3 per cent. The oil business also showed better profits on turnover up 5 per cent at DM7.5bn, although Veba said the result was still unsatisfactory. Services, transport and trade, contributing DM14.9bn to total sales, also generated earnings above last year's high level, it added. After adjustments for consolidation effects, and the inclusion of 5,600 east German electricity workers, the total workforce increased 1.7 per cent to 130,500 in the review period. Payroll costs were only 1.2 per cent higher than a year earlier at DM4.69bn.</p>

			<p><P> November 26, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TOLERANCE, DIVERSITY IN NEWPORT-MESA SCHOOLS  </P> <P> As many community members in Costa Mesa and Newport Beach know, I was recently  reelected to the Newport-Mesa school board. I want the community at large to  know how many community members came forth -- not so much to support me as an  individual as to uphold the public schools' and our nation's heritage of  tolerance and diversity.  </P> <P> In the final days of the campaign, parents and non-parent community members  spoke out on behalf of providing our children with a breadth of information  about the world in which they live. They want our young people able to deal  with the diversity of ethnicity, of religion, and of perspective -- which  enriches our society. These people spoke up. They took a stand.  </P> <P> At the same time there are some people who feel so strongly that their specific  views on an issue are the only right ones, they cannot embrace the consensus  forged by the majority.  </P> <P> While I do not acknowledge these individuals' right to impose their views on  others, I do respect their right to feel as they do and urge all of us to move  forward from here. We must focus on the fact that almost every person's actions  have come from a deep personal belief about what is best for children. Though  neighbors and people who were previously friends may now have to agree to  disagree on specific issues, my hope is that everyone will do what he or she  can to reforge friendships, and to reheal neighborhoods.  </P> <P> SHERRY LOOFBOURROW  </P> <P> Corona del Mar  </P></p>

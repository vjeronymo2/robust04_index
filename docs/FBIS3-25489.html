			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Enrico Kemp] </F>   [Text] Cape Town Feb 20 SAPA -- The Pan Africanist Congress  [PAC] will abolish all private land transactions once land has  been constitutionally restored to "the people", according to the  PAC's election manifesto. Released on Sunday, the document said  land would be expropriated through a land reform act and a land  claims court, which would function under the constitutional  court. The land would then be redistributed among "the people"  by the state, which would act as curator of all property.    The manifesto rejects any protection of freehold title or  the  acquisition of land on a "willing buyer, willing seller" basis.    Every ctizen is guaranteed equal access to land for  residential, agricultural and industrial purposes. Plots will be  allocated to people, who will act as curators of such property.  Although everyone will be free to live anywhere, agrarian land  reclaimed constitutionally will be allocated to farmers  practising agriculture at all levels.    "In our view, the restoration and redistribution of land is  a  non-negotiable starting point for meaningful reparations. A PAC  government will not buy our land from the settlers. The settlers  bought no land from our people."    On the economy, the PAC said it would not nationalise  conglomerates, corporations and financial institutions  controlled by the private sector, but these would be "socialised  and democratised to meet the needs of the community at large".  The concentration of capital in the hands of a few conglomerates  and family trusts will however be addressed through anti-trust  laws and deregulation of monopolies.    Massive labour-intensive job schemes will be initiated to  combat unemployment and a PAC government will support the  creation of small business and co-operatives.    The PAC also supported the introduction of a wealth tax to  supplement direct taxation, which would in turn form the basis  of state revenue. Indirect taxes will continue to be collected,  but VAT [value-added tax] on basic necessities such as food and  medicine will be abolished. The unemployed, aged and disabled  will be exempt from indirect taxation.    The PAC commits itself firmly to affirmative action, but  says  high standards of performance must be maintained. Statutory  "labour tribunals" will have powers to determine whether any  worker has been discriminated against.    Quotas may be introduced in the workplace not only to  correct  racial and gender imbalances but also to create a culture of  [word indistinct] among various sectors of the population.    Under a PAC government, the labour movement will be  guaranteed its independence. The government will recognise the  right to collective bargaining for all workers, including  domestic and farm workers, as well as the right to withhold  labour.    A minimum wage will be enacted and enforced by law and the  system of payment in kind prevalent on farms will be abolished.    Workers in essential services [word indistinct] teachers,  policemen, nurses will be subject to special agreements, such as  the provision of skeleton staff, to avoid the crippling of  essential services during a strike.    On housing, the manifesto promises that township houses will  be given to residents who had covered infrastructural costs  through their rents.    The private sector will be encouraged to participate in the  provision of housing through tax concessions and self-help  schemes will be encouraged.    Single-sex hostels will be abolished and employers such as  the mining sector will be responsible for the provision of  family units for employees. Ethnic mixing will be encouraged in  hostels.    The manifesto pledges free and compulsory education up to  standard 10 for every child. The PAC is committed to a single  education department, common syllabus for all pupils and an  integrated education policy.</p>

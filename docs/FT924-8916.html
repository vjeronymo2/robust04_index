			<p>921109 FT  09 NOV 92 / Yeltsin's UK talks to focus on reforms THE future of Russia's economic reforms and ways to prevent a slide into anarchy or civil war will be at the centre of talks President Boris Yeltsin will have with Mr John Major, UK prime minister, in London today. Mr Yeltsin, who rallied democratic forces after the failed coup of August 1991, is under pressure to give stronger support to his reformist government, led by Mr Yegor Gaidar, which faces a strong challenge from former communists and extreme nationalists at next month's session of the Congress of People's Deputies. In his entourage is Mr Alexander Shokhin, deputy prime minister in charge of foreign economic relations. In an interview before leaving Moscow, Mr Shokhin revealed that Russia's reformers were pressing Mr Yeltsin to resist, and threatening to resign if the conservatives were appeased. Mr Yeltsin's first official visit to London, where he will lunch with the Queen, address parliament and make a speech at the Stock Exchange, gives him temporary respite from daunting domestic problems. These include ethnic conflicts on Russia's southern borders, demands for autonomy from some of the Russian Federation's most resource-rich regions, such as Tatarstan and Sakha (the former autonomous region of Yakutia), and counter-pressures from nationalists and military men. They want credits for military industry and greater protection for 25m ethnic Russians, who have become foreigners in the Baltic and other former Soviet states. Mr Shokhin warned that easier credits for loss-making state industries, and other measures proposed by the Civic Union, the most powerful anti-government force, 'would cancel out the Gaidar cabinet's ideology. If these measures are approved by parliament or the president, then in accordance with civilised norms, we would have to go.' He believed the Civic Union leaders had 'overreached themselves' in demanding a list of resignations, including his own, and those of Mr Anatoly Chubais, deputy prime minister for privatisation, Mr Andrei Kozyrev, foreign minister, and Mr Andrei Nechayev, economics minister. Mr Yeltsin is said to have been angered by the demands. But it remains a subject of speculation in Moscow whether he will fight or accommodate the Civic Union challenge. In London, Mr Yeltsin will receive encouragement to continue with economic and other reforms. Bilateral ties have improved, and should be enhanced by the first comprehensive treaty with Russia since 1766. But Mr Yeltsin will also be looking for more practical, financial help, and closer business ties. With honourable exceptions, British business has steered clear of this difficult market, though UK multinationals such as John Brown, ICI, Rolls-Royce and several UK-based food companies have set up long-term links. Shell, BP and British Gas are among UK-based energy companies keen to help develop Russia's energy resources. For over 20 years the Soviet authorities sought help from companies such as RTZ to develop the huge but distant Udokan copper and polymetallic ore-body in Siberia and Mr Yeltsin's team is expected to revive interest in this and other potential projects. Bilateral trade remains small, with UK exports to the former Soviet Union down to Pounds 288m in the first eight months of this year against Pounds 606m in 1990. Prospects for UK exporters have improved, with up to Dollars 500m of ECGD export credit and investment insurance available. Favoured projects are those self-financed from hard-currency earnings.</p>

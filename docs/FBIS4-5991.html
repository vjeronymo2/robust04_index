			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 17 (KCNA) -- A joint statement  denouncing the West for slandering the DPRK over the fictitious  nuclear arms development was released on April 13 by G. E.  Gamza, first secretary of the Amur Regional Committee, V. V.  Grishukov, first secretary of the Maritime Territorial  Committee, and L. A. Golub, first secretary of the Khabarovsk  Territorial Committee, of the Communist Party of the Russian  Federation, staying in Korea.    The joint statement says the smear campaign launched by the  western media at the instigation of the ruling quarters of  capitalist countries is aimed at concealing the nuclear ambition  of the Japanese militarist forces and the South Korean ruling  quarters which are stepping up the production of nuclear weapons  in secrecy.    Through such vilifications, the aggressive forces of the  United States, Japan and South Korea are seeking to take the  edge off the successes made by the Korean people in socialist  construction under the guidance of the great Comrade Kim  Il-song, before the world public opinion and to tay a foundation  for openly destroying the triumphant socialism of Korea, the  statement charges.    It stresses that they would conduct brisk activities for  rousing the entire far eastern people in Russia to positively  support and encourage the Korean people's struggle.</p>

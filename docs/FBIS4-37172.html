			<p>BFN     [Text] OAU leaders and member governments yesterday  unanimously called for the lifting of the unjust measures  imposed on the Great Jamahiriyah. Moreover, they expressed  their appreciation for the positive initiatives presented by the  Jamahiriyah with a view to solving its crisis with western  states.    At the end of OAU's 30th summit held in Tunis, African  leaders adopted a resolution, issued by the Arab League, which  called for the two suspects in the Lockerbie affair to be put on  trial at the headquarters of the International Court of Justice.  The African leaders stressed that this proposal was the  suitable solution to this crisis and appealed in their  resolution to the concerned western states to respond to  initiatives calling for dialogue and negotiations to reach a  settlement of the crisis, according to the sixth chapter of the  UN charter which calls for the conflicts to be solved via  negotiations and legal settlement.</p>

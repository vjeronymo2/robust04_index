			<p><P> January 9, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOME ATHLETES BEMOAN LACK OF SUPPORT  </P> <P> Andre Hayes is a business success. He owns a thriving car-detail operation in  downtown Los Angeles, and says he will earn enough within a year to pay off  two-year-old student loans.  </P> <P> Hayes also is a success in the classroom.  </P> <P> He flunked out of the University of Washington for a quarter but went back and  earned a bachelor's degree in criminal justice. He passed the Law Scholastic  Aptitude Test last year and plans to enroll in law school.  </P> <P> Hayes is one former Washington football player Coach Don James could point to  as a model student-athlete.  </P> <P> If only he would cooperate.  </P> <P> But with academics one of the National Collegiate Athletic Assn.'s most  pressing issues after decades of seemingly little concern, Hayes is not about  to let educators -- or coaches -- off the hook.  </P> <P> Even with politicians and college presidents discussing ways to improve  graduation rates and grade-point averages -- particularly in football and men's  basketball -- Hayes is skeptical.  </P> <P> "I didn't feel like a student until I got done playing," said Hayes, who  graduated in 1987. "Then I got to see what it was really like, just going to  school."  </P> <P> Hayes said that despite recent talk of increasing graduation rates, the system  leaves something to be desired. He said that as much as 80% of his time as a  player was monopolized by practice, football meetings and watching game films.  Hayes, 26, and other former players who attended major football schools in the  1980s, offered insight into why athletes do not graduate.  </P> <P> "You get some who have the wrong attitude about why they are there," said  Hayes, who attended St. Bernard High in Playa del Rey. "They forget they are  also students. Although a small percentage make the NFL, this is their main  objective."  </P> <P> Hayes has returned to Los Angeles high schools to advise promising athletes. He  says most youngsters are surprised to hear about low graduation rates and the  even lower number of those who become pros.  </P> <P> Recruiters do not emphasize those points when trying to persuade an athlete to  attend their school, Hayes said, adding, "I tell these kids, 'You've got to  find out on your own before it's too late.' "  </P> <P> For football players Martin French of USC and Jamelle Holieway of Oklahoma, the  realization hit after season-ending injuries that probably also ruined their  chances of playing professionally.  </P> <P> French, who went to Fairfax High, was a defensive back when he broke an ankle  in the 1985 Rose Bowl game against Ohio State. He wore a cast for six months  and had three ankle operations.  </P> <P> "That made me restructure my thinking, as far as I've got to have something to  back myself up," said French, today the weekend sports producer for KTTV.  </P> <P> "It never really hit until I was out and realized I might not play anymore, and  I had to get something else going. A lot of people are not fortunate enough to  get hurt like I did."  </P> <P> Holieway, who as an 18-year-old freshman quarterback in 1985 led the Sooners to  a national championship, also was struck with the realization after suffering a  knee injury late in his junior season.  </P> <P> "It was a concern of mine to graduate," said the 1984 City Section player of  the year at Wilmington Banning. "Especially after I was injured, lying in the  hospital, I had a lot of time to think about it and to reconsider my options. I  thought I was going to play pro ball."  </P> <P> French, a communications major, and Holieway, who studied criminal justice,  have yet to fulfill their academic requirements to earn their degrees, but they  are close.  </P> <P> French returned to USC last fall to complete one class as part of the Degree  Assistance Program instituted four years ago. Seventy-six athletes have  enrolled in the program, and 46 have graduated, said Mike McGee, USC's athletic  director.  </P> <P> Holieway said he needs to take one test in a criminal law class to finish.  </P> <P> "I told my mother that degree is her Christmas present," he said.  </P> <P> Holieway, who played for a program now serving a three-year probation for  recruiting violations, came close to graduating within four years.  </P> <P> He said his mother's encouragement kept him going to classes, and earning  credits at local community colleges during the summer. Although Oklahoma's  football team has a less-than-envious academic record, Holieway has no regrets.  </P> <P> "They did what they had to do; I did what I had to do," said Holieway, who  recruits athletes for a Costa Mesa sports agent and is training to try out with  an NFL team next year.  </P> <P> "They gave me an opportunity to get my degree and I'm doing that. They got  their four years of football out of me. That's what a scholarship is. They give  you free education, you give them athletics, and after that they can't ask no  more or no less."  </P> <P> Hayes disagrees. He maintains that educators are shirking their responsibility  when dealing with certain athletes, particularly those from the inner city.  </P> <P> "The (Washington) athletic department pushed players to take certain courses  where there were friendly professors, but also to majors where the requirements  weren't as strict," Hayes said.  </P> <P> He recalled one prominent Husky, whom he would not name, who could not complete  an application to rent a house when they were roommates.  </P> <P> "I was wondering how this guy was getting through his classes," Hayes said. "No  one ever sat down and talked to him: 'You need to do this or need to do that.'  We needed more counseling . . . not just throwing him some classes just so he  could be eligible for the following season."  </P> <P> Hayes said that Washington had professors who would allow academically  ineligible football players to take correspondence courses as extra credit.  Most schools offer correspondence courses.  </P> <P> "You should see some of the papers these guys wrote and (what the professors)  let them get away with," he said.  </P> <P> Washington's overall graduation rate submitted to the NCAA last year was 48.2%.  according to Tim Washburn, the director of admissions and records. For  scholarship athletes in all sports it was 42.9%.  </P> <P> Gertrude Peoples, director of student services for Washington athletes, said  players were neither encouraged to take certain courses nor does the university  have professors sympathetic to athletes' eligibility.  </P> <P> She discourages athletes from taking correspondence courses because such  courses are usually more difficult.  </P> <P> "Courses don't crop out of the air where kids can do minimal work and get a  grade," Peoples said. "There just aren't any. I'd rather have someone  ineligible than to have them take a class like that."  </P> <P> In an effort to cater to each athlete's needs, however, she said her counselors  help athletes shape their academic future.  </P> <P> "Every major is not realistic for everybody," Peoples said. "Not everyone can  be a physics major. After two years, if a business major didn't work out, we  would help them find something better suited to them."  </P> <P> That happened to Hayes, who spent two years studying business but was unable to  advance in the difficult school with a 2.7 GPA. He switched to the study of  white-collar crime.  </P> <P> Said Peoples: "In my tenure (18 years), coaches at Washington have encouraged  kids to graduate. We've set up good tutorial programs. . . . I don't know what  anyone else could do.  </P> <P> "It makes me sad if someone left thinking they got shortchanged. It is not a  program that tries to take away from kids and give nothing back."  </P> <P> Although administrators cite statistics purporting to show that many of the  problems are being rectified, Hayes is doubtful. All he has to do is cite  schools such as Oklahoma and North Carolina State, which still have abysmal  graduation records and GPAs.  </P> <P> "I don't blame them so much for trying to lie or distort the truth," Hayes said  of administrators. "I think, quite honestly, a lot of them believe they are  doing the right thing. A lot of them believe that their system is working."  </P> <P> He also had only praise for Peoples' work with Washington athletes.  </P> <P> But in 1987, when Hayes earned his degree two years after his eligibility had  ended, he said only three Husky football players were in the graduating  ceremonies.  </P> <P> "It was pretty ridiculous," he said. "This is what it has been reduced to? It  actually boils down to being a meat market -- they get what they can out of you  and they ship you out.  </P> <P> "These administrators need to come down to the corner of South Central L.A. and  see the background where they are getting these kids and realize if (the  athletes) don't make it, look what they have to come back to. It's a one-shot  deal for these kids. They have to succeed or they have to go back and deal with  it."  </P> <P> Peoples said coaches and professors understand cultural problems attached to  recruiting inner-city players.  </P> <P> She said living in Seattle is an advantage to such athletes because they are  given a chance to see another side of life. She said 70% of the scholarship  athletes stay in Washington after finishing school.  </P> <P> Furthermore, she said, several former Husky football players have returned to  earn their degrees six years after the fact. Each is given one year's free  education.  </P> <P> Reggie Rogers enrolled for the winter quarter, which started on Wednesday. But  he must await a Jan. 16 sentencing date for a conviction of negligent homicide  in the deaths of three teen-agers stemming from a drunken-driving accident last  year in Detroit.  </P> <P> In 1986, his older brother Don, also a football star, died of a drug overdose.  </P> <P> Reggie Rogers said returning to school offers a glimmer of hope after these  tragedies. He is 33 units shy of earning a degree in psychology, and hopes to  finish in two quarters.  </P> <P> "I was hoping to play a substantial amount in the NFL to save up a lot of money  because the field (child psychology) I wanted to go in to doesn't make a lot of  money," he said.  </P> <P> But injuries from the accident made it difficult to play professionally with  the Detroit Lions and he was cut. So he returned to school sooner than  expected.  </P> <P> Unlike Hayes, Rogers said that Washington took care of athletes' academic  needs. He said a mandatory study hall after football practices forced the  players to do their homework.  </P> <P> "If they didn't make me do that, I would have gone right home and gone to bed,"  he said.  </P> <P> Rogers tried to play football and basketball, but dropped basketball his junior  season because of the rigors of being a student-athlete. He said he almost  flunked out because of the two-sport demands.  </P> <P> "It's really hard going to class when you're an athlete," he said. "My energies  were elsewhere. But basketball was too much. We would leave on a trip on  Wednesday and return on Sunday. Some of the professors wouldn't let you make up  the tests."  </P> <P> Whenever he starts, Rogers will have a friend in class. Another former  Washington player, tight end Rod Jones of the Seattle Seahawks, also returned  last week.  </P> <P> Jones said he is one or two years away from earning a degree in society and  justice. What did he do during the five years he played football?  </P> <P> "School and sports is very difficult," he said. "I even went to summer school  every summer. I don't think it matters when you graduate as long as you do it."  </P> <P> Even Hayes would agree with that.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> According to the applicant, the method for computing the sales price for the Residential Mortgage Loans required that the Plan administrator obtain the current market yield for Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC) purchases from Telerate, an independent information and pricing service regularly used by Bank Western in establishing quoted rates for new loan obligations. The Plan administrator then obtained pricing information from the Financial Publishing Company tables using a twelve year prepayment assumption. The price in the Financial Publishing tables resulted from discounting the net yield on the loans at the required FHLMC whole loan market yield.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> e. The Whole Loans <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> With respect to the Whole Loans in which the Plan had made a total investment of $2,089,978, $1,488,791 represented total income received and $122,290 represented the amount paid in servicing fees. The Plan also received a return of principal of $1,559,696 for this investment. At the time of the December 1990 sale, the Whole Loans had an outstanding principal balance plus accrued interest of $530,282. On the date of the sale, Bank Western paid the Plan $507,698 for the Whole Loans. Thus, the gross return to the Plan with respect to the Whole Loans was $3,433,895 and the net gain realized was $1,343,917.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> According to the applicant, the method established for calculating the selling price for the Whole Loans was similar to that utilized to value the Residential Mortgage Loans except that due to the age of the Whole Loans, current market yields were not used. Therefore, the Plan administrator valued the Whole Loans by referring to the yield on GNMA 9.5 percent securities as reported in the Wall Street Journal because such securities were believed to be representative of the age of the loans in these pools. The Plan administrator then discounted the net yield on the Whole Loans and determined the price for the Whole Loans from the Financial Publishing Company tables.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Upon realizing that the aforementioned transactions were prohibited transactions in violation of the Act, Bank Western offered to sell all of the Assets back to the Plan. However, the Trustees determined that because of the limited liquidity of the Assets and their investment performance, the Plan would only repurchase those Assets which it could sell at a higher price than that paid by Bank Western. Consequently, the Plan repurchased GNMA Pool C for $965,181, which was the same price that Bank Western had paid. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  This Asset was subsequently sold by the Trustees to an unrelated party for $996,154.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The applicant represents that the repurchase by the Plan of its interest in GNMA Pool C from Bank Western constitutes ``correction'' within the meaning of section 4941 of the Code. Whether the subject repurchase by the Plan represents actual correction of the prior prohibited transaction is a determination that is within the jurisdiction of the Service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 7. CNB, as successor in interest to Bank Western, requests an administrative exemption from the Department with respect to Bank Western's past purchase from the Plan of interests in the GNMA Pools, the CMO, the Residential Mortgage Loans and the Whole Loans for an aggregate cost of $2,479,808 as shown in the Asset Summary Table. CNB acknowledges that the (a) the Plan's acquisition of the Mobile Home Loans which were obtained from SAC, (b) the servicing of the Mobile Home Loans by SAC for a fee, and (c) the subsequent sale of the Mobile Home Loans by the Plan to Bank Western resulted in prohibited transactions in violation of the Act. Therefore, CNB is not requesting exemptive relief with respect to any transactions involving the Mobile Home Loans nor is the Department granting exemptive relief with respect to such loans. To the extent the resale by Bank Western of its interest in GNMA Pool C constituted a correction within the meaning of the Code, CNB is not requesting exemptive relief.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. Bank Western represents that on October 28, 1992, it filed a Form 5330 with the Service and it paid total excise taxes of $126,776 that were assessed on the Assets it acquired from the Plan. CNB, as successor in interest to Bank Western, states that it will pay any additional excise taxes that may be owed to the Service within 90 days of the publication in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of the notice granting the exemptive relief herein.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9. In summary, it is represented that the transaction satisfies the statutory criteria for an exemption under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 408(a) of the Act because: (a) The sale represented a one-time transaction for cash; (b) the sales price for each Asset was based upon its fair market value as determined by a qualified, independent appraisal; (c) the Plan did not pay any fees or commissions in connection with the sale; and (d) CNB will file a Form 5330 with the Service and pay any applicable excise taxes that may be due on any of the Assets within 90 days of the publication in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of the notice granting the exemptive relief herein.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Notice to Interested Persons <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Notice of the proposed exemption will be given to all interested persons within 30 days of the publication of the notice of pendency in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .

The notice will also inform interested persons of their right to comment on and/or to request a public hearing with respect to the proposed exemption.

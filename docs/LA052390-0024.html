			<p><P> May 23, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'THE PEOPLE' AS EXECUTIONER  </P> <P> Clearly, our society has not arrived at a consensus on the death penalty. Some  states have it, others do not. But state laws calling for executions are not  indicative of even geographically limited consensus. Passing a law requires  only a simple majority of votes in a legislature or referendum, which is not a  true consensus. Long stays on Death Row and numerous appeal proceedings may  actually be symptomatic of this lack of consensus.  </P> <P> We might come closer to consensus if a different method of execution were used,  one that clarified certain moral issues involved in the death penalty.  </P> <P> Suppose, instead of the present execution system conducted by employees of the  state, out of public sight, we select execution committees from the communities  in which the capital crimes were committed.  </P> <P> These committees would be selected on a case-by-case basis, as juries are. Once  notified, the citizen would have to report to a court-supervised proceeding to  select the 12-person execution committee.  </P> <P> An execution could not take place until the community produced a duly selected  committee. At the execution site, each of the committee would see the prisoner  in the execution chamber. At the appointed time, each would press a button that  could trigger the lethal event. The gas pellet would not drop or the  electricity would not flow until all buttons were pressed at essentially the  same time. Like a military firing squad, only one person would actually kill  the prisoner, but everyone would know that he or she might have been the one to  do so.  </P> <P> I submit that such a system is closer to the real intent of capital punishment.  At present, we arrest, try and sentence capital offenders in the name of "the  People," but assign our governmental and judicial officials the burden of  carrying out the wishes of "the People." Many such officials are uncomfortable  with this responsibility, which undoubtedly contributes to the delay. By  contrast, with the execution committee system, those who represent the segment  of society injured by the criminal would carry out the execution.  </P> <P> Society could learn from this hands-on execution process. By examining how  people are selected, or excused, from serving on an execution committee, we  could assess the willingness of a community to execute a prisoner. By studying  committee members before and after the execution, we could examine both good  and bad effects of the death penalty.  </P> <P> I have tried to imagine myself as a member of an execution committee. What  would I do the night before the execution? Go to church? Read a book? Go to a  movie? And what would I do after I pressed the button? Have breakfast? Go to  work?  </P> <P> Then, would my community treat me as if I'd done an honorable service? Or would  I be an outcast?  </P> <P> In any event, society would have the compensation it demanded, obtained by  someone from the community that suffered the crime. And no one could ever again  avoid thinking carefully about which criminals, if any, should be killed.  </P></p>

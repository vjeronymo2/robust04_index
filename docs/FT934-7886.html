			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Labour urges reforms to corporate tax LABOUR yesterday demanded urgent reform of corporate taxation and an immediate cut in interest rates to rescue Britain from an economic crisis caused by declining investment. Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, said continued low inflation and faltering retail sales left Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, 'no economic reason not to cut' rates. Setting out Labour's pre-Budget document, Mr Brown said it was 'totally wrong' for the chancellor to postpone a cut in rates until after the Budget. He also urged the government to extend capital allowances for investment, offer grants to help small businesses boost investment and develop new technology, and set up a task force to accelerate private involvement in infrastructure projects. The document - Rebuilding Britain - sets out a 10-point plan to create jobs, including the phased release of local authority capital receipts for homebuilding and a one-year holiday from national insurance contributions for employers recruiting the long-term unemployed. Mr Brown said the government faced a choice between allowing the Budget to continue the 'short-term stop-go economics of drift' and implementing radical measures to boost investment. Mr Andrew Smith, a shadow treasury minister, said there was a growing consensus that tax on investment spending was not fair at the moment. He said the government's refusal to allow tax relief for investment financed from retained earnings had an impact on investment proposals equivalent to up to 2 percentage points on interest rates. Mr Smith called for the government to start urgent consultations on the tax treatment of investment to establish a consensus on reform. Labour would undertake a consultative review involving industry, commerce and professional organisations to draw up options for government action. He added: 'If a significant increase in productive and profitable business investment could be secured by reform, as studies have suggested, every effort must be made to bring it about . . . It is important that as wide as possible a consensus is established on the best way ahead.' Ms Harriet Harman, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said government attempts to involve private capital in infrastructure projects had been a spectacular failure. She said 'a real sense of urgency' was required to identify projects which were in the national interest.</p>

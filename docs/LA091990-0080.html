At least two Hurricanes "crossed the  line" of good taste by dancing, prancing and posing after big plays in  Saturday's 52-24 victory at California, Erickson said.  </P> <P> "I wasn't very proud of it, and I know our team wasn't very proud of it," he  said. "There's a point where it's embarrassing to the program." Erickson said  players guilty of excessive celebrating will be benched for the rest of the  game and possibly longer.  </P> <P> All-American cornerback Todd Lyght suffered reinjury of a pulled hamstring and  might be sidelined for Saturday's game with No. 24 Michigan State, Notre Dame  Coach Lou Holtz said.  </P></p>

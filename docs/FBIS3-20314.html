			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Helsinki, March 25 (CTK) -- Finland's experience in  trying to gain admission to the European Union [EU] illustrates  membership is not a cure-all that brings only advantages, Czech  Premier Vaclav Klaus declared today.    EU membership is a long-term investment which has its costs  and at the beginning may be loss-making, he said. The Czech  Republic must be aware it is a difficult process, be aware of  possible pitfalls and prepare for entry with the help of  specialists able to negotiate on EU admission, he told  journalists during the first full day of his visit, which lasts  until Sunday [27 March].    Klaus pointed out that Finland's entry to the EU would,  ironically, mean the end of its free trade agreement with the  Czech Republic, which has lasted 20 years, and the limitation of  mutual trade.    When asked to respond to Polish criticism that the Czech  Republic is seeking EU entry ahead of the other members of the  Visegrad Four -- Slovakia, Hungary and Poland -- Klaus said,  "Would Finland wait for, say, Norway if Helsinki could get into  the EU before Oslo?... We ourselves could have reason to be  disappointed that Warsaw did not consult us about submitting its  official application for the EU," he said.    He said political developments in the Czech Republic would  not follow the same course as in Poland, where reform communists  have returned to power. He said in the Czech Republic the  political situation was stable, the parties politically were  clearly defined and the reforms had not provoked calls for a  return to the past.    Klaus denied he was orientated to the West, saying he was  "European." He said Europe should not demonize Russia, but  expressed concern that the process of reform had all but stopped  and that Russian foreign policy was now reflecting domestic  problems.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Belgrade, 22 Feb (TANJUG) -- The government of the  republic of Serb Krajina [RSK] today lodged a protest with the  Zagreb-based UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] command because  UNPROFOR lined up combat and technical equipment at its disposal  along the Okucani-Sava bridge road near Stara Gradiska, whose  barrels are directed toward the bridge, ISKRA [official Krajina  news agency] reported this evening.    The Krajina Government demands that UNPROFOR withdraw all  combat equipment within 24 hours, upon receipt of this demand,  ISKRA reports.    To this effect, a meeting between representatives of the  Krajina government and UNPROFOR should have been held today --  but UNPROFOR representatives informed through mediators that  they would not be coming due to fears for their personal safety.    The RSK Government considers the failure of UNPROFOR  representatives to show up as extremely frivolous, and the  reasons stated as suspicious and provocative, the Krajina  Government protest says, adding that the demonstration of force  by UNPROFOR causes a feeling of fear among the Krajina  population living on the territory of western Slavonia. The  people of Krajina know well where the danger comes from and  expect UNPROFOR to be deployed there, not on a bridge that  connects the Serb people, the protest says in conclusion.</p>

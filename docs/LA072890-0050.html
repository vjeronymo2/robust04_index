			<p><P> July 28, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOLF ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> BEMAN TAKES 1-SHOT LEAD OVER PALMER, PLAYER  </P> <P> PGA Tour Commissioner Deane Beman shot a 4-under-par 66 to take a one-stroke  lead over Arnold Palmer and Gary Player after the second round of the Seniors  British Open Friday in Turnberry, Scotland.  </P> <P> Beman, who retired 16 years ago, had a 133 after two rounds.  </P> <P> Palmer, who shot a 68 Friday after tying for the opening-round lead with a 66,  is seeking to win a pro tournament in a fifth decade.  </P> <P> The best round on this blustery day was turned in by Player, whose 65 included  an eagle 3 on the seventh hole.  </P> <P> Defending champion Bob Charles was two shots off the lead with 135, one shot  ahead of American Larry Mowry and Englishman Brian Waites.  </P> <P> Beman, 52, had six birdies in Friday's round and said he battled to maintain  his concentration after being away from competition for so long.  </P> <P> Hale Irwin, who last month became the oldest player to win a U.S. Open, shot a  nine-under-par 63 and Don Pooley shot a 65 to take a two-stroke lead, 12 under  par, in the Buick Open at Grande Blanc, Mich.  </P> <P> Ken Green also shot a 63 over the 7,014-yard Warwick Hills course. Green was  tied at 134 with U.S. Open runner-up Mike Donald, Billy Andrade and Mike  Sullivan. Fuzzy Zoeller and Dave Barr were at 135.  </P> <P> Irwin, who took the Open from Donald in a playoff at Medinah, Ill., birdied six  of the final seven holes Friday.  </P> <P> "I'm swinging well," Irwin said. "I'm not putting superbly, but I don't have to  putt too well because I'm hitting it so close."  </P> <P> Green birdied seven successive holes, the fourth through 10th, one shy of a PGA  Tour record shared by many.  </P> <P> Dewey Arnette was the last to make eight in a row, in 1987 at Warwick Hills.  </P> <P> "I goosed No. 11. I got ahead of myself," Green said. "That's what happens when  you start thinking."  </P> <P> Donald, playing the back nine first, started with a bogey but birdied 12  through 16 to get to 11 under.  </P> <P> Sue Ertl shot a four-under-par 67 and took advantage of a quadruple bogey by  Rosie Jones to take a two-stroke lead after two rounds of the LPGA  Championship, in Bethesda, Md.  </P> <P> Jones led by five strokes until her seven on the 195-yard, par-3, 16th hole.  That helped give the lead to Ertl, who had six birdies and two bogeys for a  five-under 137 total.  </P> <P> For Ertl, 32, it was the first time she led a round since the du Maurier Ltd.  Classic four years ago.  </P> <P> Jones was at 139 and Cindy Figg-Currier and Cathy Johnston were tied for third  at 140.  </P> <P> They were the only players under par after two trips over the 6,246-yard  Bethesda Country Club course. The cut, at 150, left 77 players to vie for a  share of the record $1-million purse.  </P></p>

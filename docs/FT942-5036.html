			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / New-car sales regain buoyancy New-car registrations in May were up 10 per cent year-on-year as demand rebounded from the impact of tax increases in April. Registrations increased to 150,070 from 136,386 in the same month a year ago, according to figures released yesterday by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. The rate of growth in car registrations slowed in April with a year-on-year increase of 4.8 per cent, but sales strengthened again in May in particular in the retail and small-business market. Car registrations of 821,515 in the first five months were 13.3 per cent higher than the 725,116 of the same period a year ago. Early in the year growth in fleet-car sales (to operators of at least 25 cars) outpaced the market. This was reversed last month. Sales to retail and small-business customers in May were up 13.9 per cent year-on-year compared with an increase of 6.2 per cent in fleet-car sales. Mr Ernie Thompson, chief executive of the SMMT, said the motor industry was 'poised for a better than expected 1994' following the 'encouraging' upturn in May. Carmakers were driving the market forward by 'recourse to active promotional programmes'. The UK is one of the main growth markets for new-car sales in Europe and manufacturers are intensifying their marketing activities with an array of cash rebates, special editions and other incentives. Mr Ken Martindale, chairman of Lookers, one of the leading UK motor dealer groups, said last week that some carmakers had made 'frantic efforts' to maintain market share in recent months. This had led 'to forced registrations not backed up by 'real sales'.' The manufacturers' intense marketing activities, however, had created 'some profit opportunities' for dealers, he said. Mr Paddy Byrne, sales director of Ford of Britain, the leader of the UK new-car market, said car registrations for the whole of this year were forecast to rise by 10 per cent to 1.95m from 1.78m last year. The industry is preparing for the traditional surge in car registrations that takes place in August with the change of registration prefix.

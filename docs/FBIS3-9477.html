The Muslims are probably counting on  the time when they will again mix Serbs and Muslim, thus making  Sarajevo theirs. But that will not be accepted.    "I believe in the possibility of Sarajevo one day becoming a  unified city, but it will not belong to the Muslims, but to the  Srpska republic," claims Momcilo Krajisnik, chairman of the  Srpska republic assembly, in an interview for SVET. "We will  never agree to the deployment of German or Turkish troops,  because they are still in the service of imperialism. The  Russian soldiers here can be compared to the troops from other  Islamic countries [as published], against whom we have nothing  -- except for Turkey. If Turkey succeeds in pushing its  proposal through the United Nations, we shall ask that  Yugoslavia send its troops to Bosnia," says Krajisnik.</p>

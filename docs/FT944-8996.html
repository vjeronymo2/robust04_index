			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / Leading Article: Euro-fraud Too much beef, too much grain, and now too much fraud. The European Union's institutions, particularly its Common Agricultural Policy, have generated a mountain of corruption to stand beside the other piles of unwanted commodities. The question now is whether the fraud can be curbed as long as those policies remain. This week, the Court of Auditors, the EU's financial watchdog, accused the European Commission of failing to take fraud seriously. Its 484-page report is the latest in an increasingly impassioned series from European and national organisations. Each tells the same story of fraudsters frolicking through Europe's complex rules for disbursing funds, particularly those for agriculture and infrastructure. Large sums have been paid for non-existent wheat and for sub-standard olive oil. Cartloads of sugar, cattle and sheep have been smuggled across borders and re-imported to earn subsidies. Agriculture has proved particularly troublesome because the CAP allows identical products to be sold at very different prices or to earn different subsidies on either side of increasingly porous national borders. Its complexity also facilitates fraud within a country: 'set-aside' requires detailed monitoring of each farm. Meanwhile, member states have a disincentive to uncover fraud by their citizens, given the embarrassment that follows, and the risk that their governments will then have to pay compensation. There are signs that the public is increasingly irritated, but no signs of corresponding outrage in Brussels. Beyond doubt, member countries should give more thought to the practicalities of enforcing policies before passing them. But the Commission also needs to find better tools for enforcing those which already exist. It could apply more vigorously a sanction it has sometimes wielded in the past: withholding payments from member states which cannot demonstrate good management of agricultural funds. It could also enforce existing community regulations that require member states to penalise individuals who misuse funds. It could, too, increase the potential penalties that governments face; at present, governments can be forced only to pay back the misappropriated money. One more ambitious route is also worth considering: requiring countries to contribute part of the agricultural programme's costs. A UK House of Lords committee reported this summer that EU structural programmes suffered less from fraud than agricultural schemes. It suggested that this is because countries must contribute to structural projects themselves and so have an incentive to manage the money well. Ideally, the EU would not be burdened by programmes, such as the CAP, that invite fraud. But even if they do remain, the option not available to the Commission is to allow the scams to continue. Eventually that will bring all EU programmes into disrepute.</p>

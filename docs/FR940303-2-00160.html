L. 96&hyph;193) and 14 CFR part 150. These findings are made in recognition of the description of Federal and nonfederal responsibilities in Senate Report No. 96&hyph;52 (1980). On June 29, 1993, the FAA determined that the noise exposure maps submitted by the Capital Region Airport Authority under part 150 were in compliance with applicable requirements. On January 21, 1994, the Assistant Administrator for Airports approved the Capital City Airport noise compatibility program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> All of the recommendations of the program were approved. A total of nine (9) measures were included in the Capital Region Airport Authority recommended program. Of the nine (9) measures, two (2) are listed as ``Noise Abatement Plan Measures,'' two (2) are listed as ``Program Management Measures,'' and five (5) are listed as ``Land Use Management Plan.'' The FAA has approved all of the nine (9) measures. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> The effective date of the FAA's approval of the Capital City Airport noise compatibility program is January 21, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Ernest Gubry, Federal Aviation Administration, Detroit Airports District Office, Willow Run Airport, East, 8820 Beck Road, Belleville, Michigan 48111, 313&hyph;487&hyph;7280.

The Act requires such programs to be developed in consultation with interested and affected parties including local communities, government agencies, airport users, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FAA personnel. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Each airport noise compatibility program developed in accordance with Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) part 150 is a local program, not a Federal program. The FAA does not substitute its judgment for that of the airport proprietor with respect to which measures should be recommended for action. The FAA's approval or disapproval of FAR part 150 program recommendations is measured according to the standards expressed in part 150 and the Act, and is limited to the following determinations: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a.

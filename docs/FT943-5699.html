			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / ABN Amro to use Hoare Govett name worldwide Hoare Govett, the London stockbroking firm acquired by the Dutch bank ABN Amro two years ago, is to be renamed ABN Amro Hoare Govett as part of the bank's effort to create a global investment banking arm. ABN Amro, the seventh largest European bank, is to use the name for all its equity broking, fixed income and corporate finance operations around the world provided that it can overcome regulatory hurdles in some countries. The bank has been building a network of brokers in Europe, including the Irish firm Riada Stockbrokers, CIMO in Milan, and Massonaud-Fontenay-Kervern in Paris. Along with the bank's own broking operations, these may be re-named next year. The use of both names is similar to the strategy used by Union Bank of Switzerland when it acquired the broker Phillips &amp; Drew in 1989. The London investment banking arm was known as UBS Phillips &amp; Drew until it was re-named UBS this year. However, ABN Amro's board has decided to extend the Hoare Govett name to fixed income and corporate finance operations because it regards it as a stronger international brand name than its own, which was created in a merger in 1991. ABN Amro is keen to ensure that Hoare Govett's relations with London merchant banks are not affected by the use of the name for corporate finance activities. The London corporate broking arm will still be known as Hoare Govett. Mr Rijnhard van Tets, ABN Amro's board member for global investment banking, said the change of name was intended to underline ABN Amro's commitment to the creation of a global network for underwriting and selling securities. Some 40 per cent of the assets of ABN Amro, which dominates corporate banking in the Netherlands. are outside its home country. It has a strong presence in the US through the La Salle group in Illinois, and European American Bank on Long Island. ABN Amro started running its equity operations from Hoare Govett in London this year, and is now trying to build up its European corporate finance business. The use of the combined name ABN Amro Hoare Govett could be used for marketing purposes later this year. Few of the biggest London broking firms before the Big Bang deregulation of the City in 1986 have retained their independence or their names. Rowe &amp; Pitman, the broking firm taken over by SG Warburg in 1986 was re-named SG Warburg Securities two years ago. The name of Grieveson Grant, the broker which merged with the merchant bank Kleinwort Benson, has also been dropped.</p>

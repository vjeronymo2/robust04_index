			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / World Stock Markets (America): Good company results lift equities after weak start Wall Street THE STOCK market shrugged aside early unfavourable economic news to move sharply higher in busy trading yesterday on the back of good corporate results from leading companies, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 53.71 at 2,986.88, within sighting distance of its all-time high of just below 3,000. The broader-based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was also markedly firmer, up 6.43 at 387.62, while the Nasdaq composite index of over the counter stocks bounced back from Monday's losses to rise 5.91 to 506.75, another new record. NYSE turnover was exceptionally heavy at 215m shares, with advances outpacing declines by over two to one. Prices opened weaker on news of a 0.3 per cent fall in March industrial production and an unexpectedly large decline in March housing starts. Some analysts had hoped that a rebound in the number of new houses built would confirm that the economic recovery was under way. A sprinkling of positive corporate first quarter results sparked a rally, however, with the bulk of the gains earned late in the session. A public prediction that interest rates would come down further from Mr Michael Boskin, chief economic adviser to the White House, also helped sentiment. Leading the way with good quarterly earnings was the giant drug company Merck, whose shares rose Dollars 3 1/4 to Dollars 113 on news of a rise in first quarter earnings from Dollars 1.03 a share last year to Dollars 1.25. American Home Products also did well on good results, advancing Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 62 after reporting a rise in three-month income to a record Dollars 352.4m on net sales of Dollars 1.76bn. The company also announced a new product to treat prostate enlargement. Citicorp rose Dollars  3/8 higher to Dollars 16 3/8 on turnover of 2m shares in spite of reporting a big drop in quarterly earnings from 60 cents a share in the first three months of 1990 to 10 cents a share this year. The banking group warned that 1991 would be difficult but with the bad news already discounted, the market took little notice. Of the other banks to report earnings yesterday pride of place went to West coast bank Wells Fargo, which jumped Dollars 7 1/2 to Dollars 80 on better than expected profits. Also higher were Manufacturers Hanover, up Dollars 7/8 to Dollars 27 7/8 , Chemical Bank, Dollars 3/4 firmer at Dollars 20 3/8 , and Mellon Bank, up Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 32. Securities houses again shone with large improvements in quarterly profits. Merrill Lynch, Wall Street's biggest brokerage, climbed Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 41 1/4 on news of a 338 per cent jump in first quarter income to Dollars 181m. On the secondary market Apple Computers steadied after Monday's losses, climbing Dollars 2 to Dollars 64 1/4 . The stock had fallen on poor quarterly earnings. In contrast, Intergraph, the computer graphics system manufacturer, reported first quarter income of 41 cents a share, above analysts' expectations, sending the shares Dollars 2 higher to Dollars 30 7/8 . Canada Toronto prices responded to the afternoon rally in New York and closed higher in moderate trading. The 300 composite index, barely changed through most of the session, jumped in the late going to close at 3539.73, up 23.30. Volume of 22,562,000 shares was below yesterday's 24,779,000 shares and trading value was CDollars 234.9m (CDollars 256.4m). Winning issues were ahead of losers by 315 to 256.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Stockholm, Jan 11 (AFP) -- A decision by NATO  leaders to use air power in support of UN forces in  Bosnia-Herzegovina may motivate the fighting parties to return  to the negotiating table, Swedish Foreign Minister Margaretha af  Ugglas said Tuesday [11 January].    "It is good that NATO is now sharpening its tone against the  Bosnian Serbs. The threat of air attacks is a very sharp  warning that the Serbs ought to take seriously," she said.    "The situation has worsened in recent weeks. It is a natural  frustration that is now being expressed by the NATO countries,"  she commented.    Af Ugglas, the former chairwoman of the Conference on  Security and Cooperation in Europe, would not say whether she  believes the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's threat issued  Tuesday at a summit in Brussels would be carried out to lift the  siege on threatened areas in Bosnia.    "That is a decision that must be taken by the UN's local  military commanders and the UN secretary general," she concluded.</p>

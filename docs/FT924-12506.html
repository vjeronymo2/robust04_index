			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / US household group forges Chilean link Procter &amp; Gamble, the US household and personal care group, has teamed up with Chile's leading pulp and paper manufacturer to supply southern Latin America with disposable nappies and feminine hygiene products, writes Leslie Crawford in Santiago. Procter &amp; Gamble has paid Dollars 95m for a 50 per cent share of Prosan, a disposable nappy company owned by Compania Manufacturera de Papeles y Cartones (CMPC). In addition, both companies will be linking their operations in Argentina to export their products to Uruguay, Paraguay and Bolivia. Sales are expected to top Dollars 200m next year. CMPC recently inaugurated a new Dollars 600m paper pulp plant in southern Chile built in partnership with Simpson Paper of the US. CMPC will be supplying Procter and Gamble with cellulose for its operations elsewhere in Latin America. The deal is the most recent example of the drive by Chilean companies to find new export markets, often in association with foreign partners.</p>

			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / UK Company News: AAF in talks to dispose of wheels division AAF Industries, the mini-conglomerate that plunged into the red in the first half of 1993, is at an advanced stage in talks on the possible disposal of Alloy Wheels, which makes wheels for the car industry. The division accounted for Pounds 32m of total turnover of Pounds 72.1m in 1992. The group's other activity - system building - accounted for the balance. The potential buyer is thought to be from outside the UK. The group incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 11m on turnover of Pounds 42m in the first half of last year. It is expected to announce its full year losses along with the sale - possibly later this week. Announcing interim results last October, AAF said it had concluded a joint marketing and technical collaboration agreement with Topy Industries of Japan, one of the world's largest alloy wheel manufacturers. The first-half deficit stemmed directly from expansion of its prefabricated building manufacturing business, which it bought in 1989, into an on-site contractor. The group warned last year that further costs of Pounds 7m would be incurred in the second half because of the closure of the lossmaking division. In November it sold its US modular building subsidiary for Dollars 33.3m. The group said at the time that the net proceeds of the sale would be about Dollars 13.3m (Pounds 8.8m), of which Pounds 4.3m would be used to reduce debt to about Pounds 24m, leaving gearing at between 110 per cent and 115 per cent.</p>

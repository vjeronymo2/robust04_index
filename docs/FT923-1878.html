			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / Back on your screen, Perot II: Now showing on Jurek Martin's TV, The Return of the Non-Candidate IT WAS as if he had never gone away. Last Friday Ross Perot was on breakfast television, public television and late-night television and, for good measure, he threw in an interview with the Washington Post. But at the end of the day, as in the springtime of his non-candidacy for the presidency, it was not easy to work out what the little billionaire from Texas was actually threatening to do. On Friday, he was registered as a presidential candidate in Arizona, which means his name will appear on the ballot in all 50 states on November 3. Even though he announced in July that he would not run, some public opinion polls continue to track his popularity and demonstrate that he could still be a factor, though never a winner, 45 days from now. The latest Washington Post poll, for example, gave him 15 per cent (against 45 per cent for Mr Bill Clinton and 31 per cent for President George Bush) in a hypothetical three-way race. Most pundits think that unless he formally declares he will get much less than that, but could still swing the outcome in such states as his native Texas. The bottom line of his Friday round appeared to be his continued concern that neither Mr Clinton nor Mr Bush was yet seriously addressing the problem of reducing the budget deficit and the national debt. His solution, he repeatedly said, had been outlined in his recent paperback book, which is indeed a best-seller now though his inability to provide such a blueprint while still thinking of running was widely criticised. The only way, he said, to get his views across was to buy television advertising time. But the big networks told him this would only be possible if he became a presidential candidate. 'I may be the only guy in history,' he said with typical hyperbole, 'that had to declare he was a candidate so he could buy TV time.' Pressed by interviewers to say if this meant he was getting back into the race, Mr Perot fell back on a familiar line: this was up to his 'volunteers'. His movement, he kept saying, was 'bottoms up' not 'top down', as in the two main parties, and he poured scorn on questioners who failed to understand his mystical rapport with ordinary citizens. His movement is indeed showing signs of life, though many volunteers felt left in the lurch when he abruptly pulled out in the middle of the Democratic convention in July. He claimed then that his presence on the ballot would only ensure a deadlocked election and that the Democratic party seemed 'revitalised'. These reasons he now glosses over, though more than a suspicion persists that he retains contempt for Mr Bush. Whatever his ultimate plans, if he even knows them, there is little doubt that Mr Perot has felt liberated by no longer being subject to conventional political advice and scrutiny. His formidable ego and yearning for the limelight have been restored by the uncritical and unfiltered flattery of 'the volunteers', who really do seem to believe that he alone is able to save the nation from perdition. But published post mortems of his abortive earlier effort have revealed potentially damaging information should he re-engage. A devastating article in Vanity Fair magazine paints a generally scary picture of a wilfully ignorant autocrat consumed by conspiracy theories and almost paranoid about security. It also contains two specific allegations: that Mr Perot ordered a private investigation of his daughter's relationship with a university professor who happened to be Jewish, and that he had sanctioned the immediate firing of an employee with the HIV virus. Mr Perot dismissed both charges as the worst examples of tabloid journalism.</p>

			<p><P> August 31, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> OCEANSIDE ASKS JUDGE TO REVIEW GROWTH LAW;  </P> <P> HOUSING: CITY FILES MOTION REQUESTING RECONSIDERATION OF A DECISION THAT  FAVORED DEVELOPERS IN A SUIT OVER BUILDING LIMITS.  </P> <P> Oceanside has asked Vista Superior Court Judge Herbert B. Hoffman to reconsider  his decision that favored developers in a suit against the city's  growth-control law.  </P> <P> City Atty. Charles Revlett said Thursday that a motion has been filed asking  Hoffman to change his Aug. 23 ruling because, he contends, it was based on  factual and legal errors.  </P> <P> A hearing on the motion is set for Sept. 17. The issue is being monitored by  cities throughout the state that have growth limitations.  </P> <P> Hoffman's decision favored the Building Industry Assn. of San Diego and  developer Del Oro Hills by concluding that the city's growth control law,  Proposition A, does not guarantee enough lower-income housing.  </P> <P> Although the association praised the decision as doing much to invalidate  Proposition A, it has become clear that Oceanside will continue to defend its  law that was passed by voters in April 1987 and has cost the city $1.5 million  in legal fees.  </P> <P> Revlett said the City Council, which discussed the litigation in closed-door  session Thursday, "is unified. They are well aware that, once an ordinance is  passed by initiative, they have a duty . . . to implement that ordinance to the  very best of their ability."  </P> <P> Mayor Larry Bagley was reluctant to talk about the city's attitude, saying, "I  don't want to say anything that would give comfort or discomfort" to the  association or Del Oro Hills.  </P> <P> The association's attorney, Donald Worley, was unavailable Thursday to comment  on the city's request for reconsideration.  </P> <P> Proposition A limits residential building to 800 units a year, or a cumulative  total of 10,600 new dwellings by 1999. The 10,600 figure includes additional  units that are exempt from Proposition A, including housing for seniors, low-or  moderate-income families and rehabilitated units.  </P> <P> Although Hoffman agreed that Oceanside has exceeded its fair share of  affordable housing, he felt Proposition A didn't assure that the city would  provide sufficient lower-income housing in the future.  </P> <P> Revlett argued that the judge based his decision on errors, including an  undercount of how many affordable housing units the city actually has plans to  build.  </P> <P> If Hoffman declines to reconsider, Revlett said he "definitely would not rule  out" filing a writ to request that the state Court of Appeal consider the  issue.  </P> <P> The outcome of that appeal could help determine whether there is a trial, now  planned to begin in October, over a separate aspect of Proposition A.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Natalya Pachegina in the "Negotiations" column: </F> "Groznyy Is Unhappy With Russia's Terms. Nonetheless It Is  Ready for Dialogue"]    [Text] The results of the preliminary talks in Moscow  between Chechen Republic State Secretary Aslambek Akbulatov and  Russian presidential administration chief Sergey Filatov have  not as yet received official approval in Groznyy. According to  Republic parliament chairman Yakhyat Idigov, Chechnya regards  the positions outlined by both sides at this stage as fairly  satisfactory. Russia's conditions (there are two) are that  Chechnya will continue to be a component of the Russian  Federation and that democratic elections be held there, Sergey  Shakhray, Russian nationalities and regional policy minister,  told a State Duma session. It is another matter, Idigov said,  that the Chechen leadership is in no haste to accept these terms  as an expression of the government viewpoint on the issue of  relations with the republic. "We know Shakhray's position,"  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA's correspondent was told, "but this does not  mean that these are actually Russia's terms." Groznyy knows  that there are forces in Russia capable of abandoning the old-  fashioned ambitions.    In this respect, the interlocutor made clear, Groznyy does  not see the Russian State Duma and the Federation Council as  reliable allies. Primarily because in the eyes of the incumbent  Chechen authorities their Russian colleagues do not represent  legitimate executive bodies. Nonetheless, Groznyy is left with  no other option than to accept the inevitable, especially given  that over here "it is traditional to respect the choice of  Russia's peoples who have elected the present composition of the  Federal Assembly."    With respect to the possibility of the anti-Dudayev  opposition's using the name and authority of Ruslan Khasbulatov,  who now lives in Groznyy, Idigov noted that Ruslan Khasbulatov,  a citizen of Chechnya, a well-known advocate of the idea of "a  single and indivisible Russia," will not find it very easy to  retain his authority among his fellow countrymen. Recalling the  details of the nearly two-centuries-old Russian-Chechen  "alliance," speaker Idigov observed that furthermore, on the  issue of Chechnya's independence, the anti-Dudayev opposition  fully shares the position of Groznyy officialdom and that no  Khasbulatov or his admirers, "bent by Soviet rule," will manage  "to buy the hard-won freedom so cheaply." Neither will this  "maneuver" come off with certain Russian politicians who are  trying, as it is known to Groznyy, to "involve" Khasbulatov in  the complicated Russian-Chechen relations.</p>

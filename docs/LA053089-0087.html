			<p><P> May 30, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S.-INDUSTRIAL PARTNERSHIP SPLIT ON HOW TO PAY FOR EFFORT  </P> <P> Leaders in high-tech manufacturing are full of praise for Commerce Secretary  Robert A. Mosbacher's endorsement of a new industry-government partnership to  improve American competitiveness.  </P> <P> But they acknowledge, tongue in cheek, "minor" differences over one point:  Money.  </P> <P> The industrial officials say that, like Mosbacher, they oppose a heavy-handed  program of federal bureaucrats dictating industrial policy. The government's  past tries at picking winners have typically been expensive flops such as the  effort to create a synthetic fuels industry in the 1970s.  </P> <P> Instead, the manufacturers want an "industry-led" policy where the private  sector judges the market and chooses products and research programs worthy of  special backing.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Cooperation Endorsed  </P> <P> "It's not a bunch of guys in Washington sitting in a closet saying this is the  way it's going to be," said Robert Costello, a former undersecretary of  defense, now at the Hudson Institute, a private research group.  </P> <P> Mosbacher, in a major departure from the free-market views of the Reagan  Administration, endorsed that concept -- which involves cooperation rather than  competition among companies -- in a speech earlier this month to the Economic  Club of Detroit.  </P> <P> The commerce secretary and the manufacturers diverge, however, on who should  pay. Mosbacher wants an industry-led and mostly industry-financed effort, while  the manufacturing executives say government must match private funding.  </P> <P> "I feel it is imperative that we communicate to the Administration that at some  not too distant point more government funding is needed," said Rep. Mel Levine  (D-Calif.), who led an industrial policy conference last week attended by such  high-tech superstars as Robert Noyce, co-inventor of the microprocessor.  </P> <P> But Mosbacher, speaking of the most likely candidate for a public-private  partnership, high-definition television, warned at a congressional hearing that  electronics companies asking for $1.35 billion in federal aid shouldn't expect  Uncle Sam to act like "Uncle Sugar."  </P> <P> Instead, he said industry can look to government to encourage research through  such methods as loosening antitrust restrictions and providing tax incentives.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Opposition Within Cabinet  </P> <P> Levine and other participants in last week's conference are down-playing the  money fight and lauding Mosbacher's step away from the doctrines of the  previous Administration.  </P> <P> Mosbacher's statements are "a very significant step in the right direction,"  Levine said. "I don't want to underestimate the differences we have with the  Administration at this point, but I think they can be bridged."  </P> <P> However, it probably won't be enough to convince Mosbacher, even though he  enjoys great influence with President Bush, an old friend. The commerce  secretary reportedly faces opposition within the Cabinet from chief economic  adviser Michael J. Boskin and budget director Richard G. Darman.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] In an effort to maintain peace throughout the length  and breadth of Liberia, the West African peacekeeping force,  ECOMOG [Economic Community of West African States Cease-Fire  Monitoring Group], has declared from Po River to Clay Junction  safe for civilians. The peacekeeping force's 15th Brigade  commander, Brigadier General Ajibola Kunle Togun, who gave the  assurance, said the area is now safe and marketers and civilians  can now begin plying the road.    The general gave the assurance yesterday when he led a team  of journalists on a tour of the area mainly to dispel rumors  that the Po River Bridge had come under fire during fighting  between two splinter groups of ULIMO [United Liberation Movement  for Democracy in Liberia]. According to Gen. Togun, there was  no fighting in the Po River area and that ECOMOG is in full  control. He said that ECOMOG has taken charge of all roadblocks  previously manned by ULIMO in that area. ECOMOG had also  ordered all ULIMO fighters to stay off the road between Clay  Junction and Po River and not to harass any citizens. The  fighters are said to be cooperating. The president was taken to  Klo Town, near Klo Junction, where the ULIMO splinter group  consisting mainly of Krahn fighters, is stationed.</p>

			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / International Company News: Burns Philp buys German spice producer Burns Philp, the Australian food group, has expanded in Europe with the purchase of Karl Ostmann, the German herbs and spices producer, for DM182m (Dollars 107m) plus a working capital adjustment expected to be about DM20m. Mr Andrew Turnbull, Burns Philp managing director, said yesterday Ostmann had gross annual sales of DM190m, exported to 30 countries and controlled subsidiaries in the UK and South Africa. Latest annual net profit was DM5.5m. The purchase would lift Burns Philp's herbs and spices sales by about 25 per cent. 'Such benefits include synergies in raw materials sourcing and packaging, sharing of manufacturing and marketing skills, increased distribution efficiencies, an expanded customer network and optimal utilisation of production facilities,' Mr Turnbull said. Burns Philp entered the European market in 1982 and controls brands including Fleischmanns, Euroma, Cornwells and Durkee. Goodman Fielder, the Australian food group, had no comment to stock exchange reports yesterday that it was negotiating to take a 15 per cent stake in Bunge, the Dutch food group.</p>

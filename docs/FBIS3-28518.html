Amirkahar, who is the former USNO president, and  other officials have been submitting their membership forms to  PBS President Datuk Sri Joseph Pairin Kitingan over the past few  days.    Pairin confirmed today that they have become full-fledged  members of the PBS since the party constitution requires that  those standing on a PBS ticket must be a party member. "It is a  temporary measure to comply with the PBS constitution," he told  reporters here after witnessing the Sabah Premier League players  sign their contract with the State Football Association. Pairin  said once the election was over, these leaders could resign from  the PBS and join USNO Baru [New] or any other party. "If USNO  Baru is registered, they can resign from the PBS and join USNO  Baru. There is nothing complicated about it," he said. Pairin  said the move to make them members was not to force them to  remain in the PBS.    When contacted today, PBS-Plus Codirector of Operations  Mohamed Naser Mohamed Noor who quit his post yesterday, said  there was no longer a PBS-Plus grouping and Amirkahar's group  had betrayed their supporters by joining the PBS. Naser, who was  the political secretary to Amirkahar, said the move would result  in thousands of USNO supporters abandoning their support for  Amirkahar and his group. He said he would work hard to ensure  these supporters back the Barisan Nasional [National Front].  [passage omitted]</p>

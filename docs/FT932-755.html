			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / Finance and the Family: Executives need to reassess pensions / Review of the effect of a Budget bombshell NORMAN LAMONT, the former chancellor, dropped a small bombshell in this year's Budget when he froze the earnings ceiling at Pounds 75,000 instead of increasing it in line with the Retail Price Index. This ceiling, known as the 'cap', means that only the first Pounds 75,000 of an executive's earnings can be taken into account in arranging pension benefits in an approved scheme (one which qualifies for full tax relief). So his action in freezing the cap points to the need for executives to look at other methods of boosting their benefits at retirement in respect of their earnings above Pounds 75,000. There are two courses available for executives - make additional pension provision on a less tax efficient basis and/or make use of other tax efficient savings vehicles to provide benefits at retirement. Pension consultants have been devising schemes to provide additional benefits every since the cap was introduced in April 1989. Basically, there are two alternative routes that can be taken. First, the benefits can be unfunded, that is the employer promises to pay the benefits to the executive when he or she retires. Benefit entitlement can be built up in the normal manner while the executive is still working for the company and can be written into employment contracts. But effectively, the executive is paid out of company profits at the time of retirement. An unfunded arrangement does not involve the employee in any tax liability until the benefits are paid, when they are taxed - both income and cash sums  -at the executive's top rate. But there is no security in such arrangements. The executive is relying on the company honouring the commitment at the time of retirement - there could be problems if the company is under financial strain at the time or if ownership has changed. An unfunded arrangement is useful if the executive's earnings are not much above the cap. When earnings greatly exceed the cap, executives want and need the security provided by a funded arrangement, with the company paying contributions in advance to provide the additional benefits - the Funded Unapproved Retirement Benefit Scheme, known as Furbs. There are different versions of Furbs, but all aim to mitigate the tax disadvantages of an unapproved scheme - tax on the contributions, the underlying funds being taxed and the benefits being taxed. Under a Furbs, the employer's contributions are treated as a benefit in kind to the executive and the executive is taxed accordingly. There is no way to avoid this charge. Paid Furbs contributions do not give rise to an additional National Insurance contribution charge on the employer. If the Furbs is invested in the UK, then the underlying funds/securities will be taxed accordingly. However, if the Furbs is set up offshore, then the funds can roll up on a gross basis. However, this benefit is mitigated through the fund having to pay withholding taxes on overseas equity dividends - a tax that UK gross funds can avoid and charges are far higher than for onshore exempt funds. It is understood that the Inland Revenue is uneasy over offshore funds for UK pension provision. This unease could be translated into legislation against such funds. Finally, with a Furbs, lump sum payments are tax free, but income payments are taxable. Hence, executives would take the accumulated benefits on a Furbs as cash and make their own arrangements about converting that capital into income. Executives seeking to get their company to arrange a Furbs should check on the tax position and the charges being levied. It should be arranged through an experienced consultant or adviser. Where possible, the executive should ensure that any tax/NI contribution claims have been confirmed in writing by the Inland Revenue and the Department of Social Security. As stated, the cap's introduction has focused attention on other methods of boosting benefits at retirement. A personal equity plan is the first method to be considered. It is flexible and tax efficient, except that contributions do not attract tax relief. Share option and share incentive schemes are both useful vehicles enabling executives to accumulate substantial cash sums on a flexible, tax efficient basis in the form of ordinary shares of the company. However, share option and share incentive schemes are only available to those executives working for companies whose shares are quoted. And they rely on steady growth in the share price and the dividend payouts. Little has been done, however, to help the self-employed make contributions towards their pension on earnings above the cap, without suffering the full tax impact.</p>

This amendment limits the number of magnetos requiring replacement. This amendment is prompted by a report from the manufacturer that there is an error in the serial number listing of affected magnetos. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent magneto failure and subsequent engine failure. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Effective September 6, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of September 6, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comments for inclusion in the Rules Docket must be received on or before October 21, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), New England Region, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, Attention: Rules Docket No. 93&hyph;ANE&hyph;44, 12 New England Executive Park, Burlington, MA 01803&hyph;5299.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The service information referenced in this AD may be obtained from Teledyne Continental Motors, P.O.

For S&hyph;1200 series magnetos, the AD requires replacing only the ignition coils as the rotating magnets on that series magneto already incorporates the improved TCM design. Additionally, the AD requires remarking magnetos to indicate compliance with the AD. That action was prompted by recent reports of accidents caused by failures of magnetos incorporating older Bendix components that had not been replaced in accordance with superseded AD 73&hyph;07&hyph;04, Amendment 39&hyph;1731 (38 FR 27600, October 5, 1973). That condition, if not corrected, could result in magneto failure and subsequent engine failure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Since the issuance of that AD, TCM has informed the FAA that an error in the serial number listing in TCM Service Bulletin (SB) No. 637, dated December 1992, resulted in too many affected magnetos requiring AD compliance. The AD should apply only to certain magnetos manufactured by Bendix in Sidney, New York, and not to any Bendix magnetos built in either Jacksonville, Florida, or Atlanta, Georgia. In addition, the S&hyph;600 series magnetos require replacement of only the rotating magnets and not the ignition coils. Finally, the FAA received reports that there is some confusion as to how the S&hyph;20, S&hyph;200, S&hyph;600, and S&hyph;1200 series magnetos are referenced in the TCM SB and the AD. TCM has issued a revised SB that corrects these errors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA has reviewed and approved the technical contents of TCM Mandatory Service Bulletin (MSB) No. MSB644, dated April 4, 1994, that describes procedures for replacing certain Bendix ignition coils and rotating magnets with improved serviceable TCM ignition coils and rotating magnets and marking magnetos to indicate compliance with this MSB.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

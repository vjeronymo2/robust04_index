			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Victor M. Carrida] </F>   [Text] Mexico City, 2 Jun (PL) -- If total failure was the  result of the visit U.S. lawmaker Roberto Torricelli paid to  Mexico, the important actions of solidarity with Cuba registered  here increase the dimensions of the fiasco.    Known at the international level for being the author of the  law bearing his name to strengthen the economic blockade imposed  by Washington against Havana more than 30 years ago, Torricelli  arrived in Mexico with very clear plans of supervising and  meddling, according to the Mexican press.    A few days before arriving in this city, the congressman  presented a draft law that calls for political reforms in Mexico  and for international observers in the Mexican federal elections  to be held in August.    Furthermore, he arrived with the purpose of getting directly  involved in the armed conflict that has been taking place in the  southern State of Chiapas since early this year and of holding a  meeting with the rebel Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN),  which is leading the rebellion by the Chiapas Indians that began  on New Year's Day.    However, in an open rejection of the visitor, the Zapatists  burned the letter in which Torricelli requested a meeting.  Torricelli was not received either by Amado Avendano,  independent candidate for governor of Chiapas and director of  the daily TIEMPO from San Cristobal de las Casas, a newspaper  that plays an important role in the evolution of the conflict in  Chiapas. Leaders from other political and social organizations  of this state also refused to talk with the congressman.  Torricelli left Chiapas one day ahead of schedule.    The situation in Mexico City was not encouraging either.  Deputies, high-ranking government officials, and the press in  general did not spare any criticism of the interventionist  purposes of the legislator, and they went as far as proposing  that he be declared persona non grata.    On Sunday, a group of activists from the Promoters of  Solidarity with Cuba group demonstrated in front of the U.S.  Embassy here to protest the lawmaker's visit, and they burned a  coffin with a dummy that symbolized the visitor and his  well-known anti-Cuban law.    Exactly one day before concluding his stay in Cuba,  Torricelli witnessed the announcement of the official visit  Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari will make to Havana  in mid-June. According to the request made by the president for  authorization from National Congress to leave the country, the  visit to Cuba "will serve to promote even more bilateral  relations, evaluate the contents of the agenda, and explore new  actions that will diversify and strengthen it."    This idea was supported here last night by the Chamber of  Deputies when it approved the president's request and pointed  out that the visit will be "a show of Mexico's solidarity for  the Cuban people and of the standards that guide Mexican foreign  policy." Rodolfo Becerril, chairman of the Chamber of Deputies'  foreign relations committee, emphasized that Salinas' visit to  Havana "is taking place at a time when some U.S. Congressmen  want to tighten the blockade against that country (Cuba) and on  the eve of the (fourth) Ibero-American Summit."    The stand voiced by the deputies was emphasized when the  Mexican legislators of the six parties of the chamber decided to  donate one day's salary to the Cubans. This money will be used  to purchase petroleum for the island. The legislators are from  the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), Party of the  Democratic Revolution (PRD), National Action Party (PAN),  Authentic Party of the Mexican Revolution (PARM), Popular  Socialist Party (PPS), and the Cardenist Front for National  Reconstruction Party (PFCRN).    When referring to Torricelli's recent visit to Mexico,  Foreign Under Secretary Andres Rozental said that the U.S.  legislator's visit "was rejected in general, and this united all  Mexicans." The high-ranking official pointed out that NAFTA,  which was signed by Mexico, the United States, and Canada, does  not give any country the right to intervene in the affairs of  the other, and he insisted that commercial integration involves  social and political aspects.</p>

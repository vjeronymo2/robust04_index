			<p><P> July 26, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PASADENA TO CO-OWN HAWKEY'S NEW HOME  </P> <P> The city will invest $377,500 to become majority owner of City Manager Philip  Hawkey's new $615,000 home on the East Arroyo.  </P> <P> Hawkey will provide $50,000 of his own money and secure a loan for $187,500 to  complete the deal.  </P> <P> The equity participation agreement was approved Tuesday by the Board of  Directors as part of the housing assistance specified under the city's contract  with the former Toledo, Ohio, city manager, who began work in Pasadena on June  18.  </P> <P> Director Chris Holden voted against the investment and Director Bill Paparian  was absent.  </P> <P> "The city investment is considerably high as I see it," Holden said, adding  that he had seen ads for comparable houses for $479,000 and $439,000.  </P> <P> But Director Rick Cole, who along with Holden had opposed Hawkey's selection,  said the time had passed to oppose the assistance. He said the board had agreed  to provide assistance without mention of a specific dollar amount.  </P> <P> Hawkey's selection in April over two black candidates generated a 4-3 split on  the board and opposition from many minority residents.  </P> <P> The 2,975-square-foot traditional home on Wotkyns Drive was built in 1931.  Hawkey said he picked the house after looking at nearly 70 homes and  negotiating the price down from $688,000. Surrounding homes are more expensive,  he said.  </P> <P> The Pasadena home is a step down from the 5,400-square-foot home that he owned  in Toledo, Hawkey said. But, he added, that residence sold for only $145,000,  providing him with $30,000 worth of equity toward a $50,000 down payment in  Pasadena.  </P> <P> The remaining $20,000 down payment will come from personal means, he said.  </P> <P> Hawkey said that his monthly payments will amount to about $3,000. City Atty.  Victor Kaleta said the arrangement places the city at little risk. In the event  Hawkey defaults on his $187,500 loan, ends employment with the city or sells  the home, the city would receive its investment back, plus any profits based on  its percentage of ownership.  </P> <P> Hawkey is the second top-ranking city employee to receive housing assistance  this year. In March, the board approved a $45,000 loan to help City Clerk  Marvell Herren buy a $305,000 home in the San Rafael Hills.  </P> <P> By providing the assistance, Pasadena joins a growing number of cities  statewide that are pitching in to help their top employees with housing.  </P> <P> Such help includes low-interest loans from the city, aid in obtaining mortgages  from outside lenders, housing allowances and contributions toward down  payments.  </P> <P> City Director John Crowley said Tuesday that Caltech has been providing equity  participation arrangements for its top officials for the past 10 years and thus  such arrangements are not unique.  </P></p>

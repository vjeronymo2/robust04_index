The programs will  promote measures to convert regions and businesses affected by  the rundown in defense-related activities in Baden-Wuerttemberg,  Berlin, Brandenburg, Hesse, Rhineland-Palatinate, Saarland,  Schleswig- Holstein, Saxony and Thuringia. The ERDF is to  contribute ECU14.2 million and total costs, including German  part-financing, amount to ECU46.8 million.    The programs cover the following priorities:    - Consulting services and assistance in the conversion of  defense production to civil production, in particular for small  and medium-sized businesses;    - innovation promotion and technology transfer measures --  planning and development concepts;    - restoration of land previously used for military purposes.    The projects include: environmental redevelopment and change  of the designated use of the Altes Lager in Jueterbog so that a  polytechnic college can be built (Brandenburg), waste disposal  measures on an area previously used by Western units of the CIS  armed forces on the Ravensbrueck concentration camp memorial  site (Brandenburg), the construction of a software center in  Marburg (Hesse) and the construction of an industry and service  sector park on the site of the former Holtzendorff barracks in  Kaiserslautern (Rhineland-Palatinate). Commenting on the  decision, Mr. Millan said the German Konver programs meant that  the initiative had now reached the practical implementation  stage in all member states, and that as a result of the good  cooperation between the Commission and the national authorities  concerned it had been possible to adopt the decisions in an  extremely short time.</p>

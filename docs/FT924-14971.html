			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / International Company News: AMD shows strong third-quarter advance ADVANCED Micro Devices, the US semiconductor manufacturer, yesterday reported strong third-quarter sales boosted by demand for microprocessors used in personal computers. The company, which saw profits advance during the quarter, also revealed a sharp increase in orders during the normally slow summer season. 'We believe AMD is now the world's largest producer of 386 microprocessors,' said Mr W. J. Sanders III, AMD chairman and chief executive. Net income for the quarter was Dollars 49.1m before payment of dividends on preferred stock, compared with Dollars 17.1m last time. Revenues rose 23 per cent to Dollars 356.7m from Dollars 289.4m in the same period last year. After the preferred stock dividend, quarterly net income was 51 cents per common share, up from 16 cents. Strong third-quarter orders portend accelerating growth in the fourth quarter, Mr Sanders said. 'We expect Am386 microprocessor unit sales volumes will remain at record levels in the current quarter,' he added. AMD's 386 success follows bitter legal disputes with Intel, the original maker of 386 microprocessors. Although AMD claims to have overtaken Intel in 386 sales, the market is switching to the new 486 microprocessors of which Intel is the dominant supplier. For the first nine months the company reported revenues of Dollars 1.1bn, an increase of 29 per cent, with net income of Dollars 175.4m before preferred dividends, or Dollars 1.84 after dividend payments. For the same period last year sales were Dollars 860.5m and net income was Dollars 30.8m.</p>

			<p><P> March 2, 1990, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> NATIONWIDE;  </P> <P> INACCURACIES CITED IN CHOLESTEROL TESTS  </P> <P> Cholesterol tests conducted by private testing companies are highly inaccurate  up to 25% of the time, and some widely used portable testing machines have  unacceptably high error rates, studies reported in the Journal of the American  Medical Assn. said. Poorly trained operators are a primary cause of erroneous  readings, one study found. Three brands of machines were found to have the  highest error rates -- the Analyst, made by Du Pont Inc., the Seralyzer, made  by Miles Laboratories Inc., and the Reflotron, made by Boehringer-Mannheim  Diagnostics Inc. Excess cholesterol in the blood is an indicator of increased  likelihood of heart disease.  </P></p>

			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / Markets: Unit trust Peps take off - At a glance Unit trust personal equity plans seem to have taken off at last. In the third quarter of this year, with new share issues flopping almost daily, regular doses of dreadful economic news including Black Wednesday itself, and end-of-year tax-planning still months away, sales of unit trust Peps still managed to surge. Net inflow for the quarter was Pounds 319m, compared with only Pounds 141m for the same quarter in 1991. The total value of unit trust Pep funds under management is now Pounds 2.62bn, more than triple its level of two years ago. For September, the number of trusts continued its inexorable increase, from 1,423 to 1,428, while the number of unitholder accounts fell from 4.4m to 4.38m.</p>

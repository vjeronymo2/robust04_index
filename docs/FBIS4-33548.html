			<p>BFN     [Text] The implementation of Decree Law 149 against money  hoarders has begun without much publicity and without wasting  any time, as a way to ensure that respect for the law and  citizen coexistence reign in Cuba.    According to GRANMA newspaper, the attorney general's office  has reiterated that Decree Law No. 149 should not be and is not  intended to be a crusade or witch hunt, but the beginning of a  practice that should become an everyday affair, a resolution  with a permanent nature.    In principle, it has been demonstrated that the term money  hoarder does not exempt any part of the population nor that the  action taken is uncalled for, judging by what has been found.  There are specific examples that demonstrate this, such as the  case of the workshop administrator in Guira de Melena, who with  a salary of 167 pesos per month, was the owner of four boats, a  motorcycle, a truck, and several household appliances; or of  another citizen in Pinar del Rio, who had four trucks, two cars,  two motorcycles, a rice mill, a welding plant, six houses, more  than 35,000 pesos, and large quantities of automobile parts,  accessories, and tires.    GRANMA newspaper also points out that the provincial  prosecutors must act according to the methodological  dispositions and not on whim. The process has been to make an  inventory of the goods, leave some as a deposit, freeze certain  assets, and seize others that are stored at an established place  until the investigation has concluded, and a decision is made  regarding the case. During this process, other hidden illegal  activities may be found, including the use of forms to acquire  profit, and the lack of control that has allowed state resources  to end up in the hands of these individuals.    Decree Law 149 has ceased to represent the money hoarders as  cases on file. It has become action against those who enjoy a  lifestyle that exceeds their income.</p>

			<p><P> December 9, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> Norm Sloan, former Florida basketball coach, and his top assistant coach told a  grand jury that former Florida star Vernon Maxwell might have turned against  them because he thought they had revealed his drug use to reporters, a  newspaper said.  </P> <P> In testimony obtained by the Palm Beach Post, Monte Towe, said: "That's  something he has blamed, I think, on us. But we didn't have anything to do with  it."  </P> <P> Testimony by Sloan and Towe before the panel investigating drug use in the  Gainesville area centered on Maxwell.  </P> <P> Maxwell, Florida's all-time leading scorer, tested positive for cocaine use at  the 1988 NCAA tournament. After that news broke, Maxwell's status in the NBA  draft slipped. Projected as a possible first-round pick, he was not taken until  late in the second round by the San Antonio Spurs.  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 21, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> A city board's order to remove American flags from shops and other businesses  in San Juan Bautista has raised tempers and created controversy in the small  mission town. Lonny Greywolf Hurlbut, San Juan Bautista's acting police chief  and a Korean War veteran, said he will refuse to obey the order by the city's  cultural resources board. The board ordered shopkeepers to stop displaying Old  Glory in front of their businesses, accusing them of using the Stars and  Stripes to attract customers. The flag flap started this spring after the board  conducted a survey of the town's signs and found dozens of alleged violations  of the local sign ordinance. Among them was the use of the American flag for  commercial, rather than patriotic, purposes.  </P></p>

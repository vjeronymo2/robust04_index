			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / The Markets: Lucas? Leave it to George - The Bottom Line George Simpson has descended on Lucas Industries with the aura of a messiah. The man who turned Rover Cars into such an attractive proposition that BMW of Germany arrived to buy it can spread his magic over Lucas. George will fix it. This week, he used that reputation to add lustre to his first plans as chief executive of the component-maker - a company which, he said, had been 'a little bit accident-prone, but it's got better in the last couple of years.' The lustre hung over annual results which, instead of making hardened City men blink and call for management changes, sent the market price winging upwards. The plans were designed to show 'a determined management team' gripping the issues, concentrating 'on a narrower spread of core activities' with the vision of being 'a global leader in the provision and support of high integrity systems for the automotive and aerospace industries'. The results reflected the plans: a financial clearing of the decks in readiness for change. They gave the initial impression that any conceivable piece of bad news which could be thrown in had been thrown in; exceptional items of Pounds 213.9m led to a pre-tax loss of Pounds 129.7m. In the normal course of events, the announcement of provisions more than twice as large as the direst prediction would send a stock price downwards. But not Lucas this week: its price climbed towards 200p from 177p. Beyond the Simpson factor, enhanced by his public appearance of cool determination, there were a number of reasons for this. First, the markets for Lucas products are improving: automotive is strong and will strengthen further as France and Germany emerge from recession, while aerospace looks as if it will not deteriorate further. So, there was not much problem for the analysts in predicting improved earnings and, on the back of that, at least a maintained 1994-95 dividend of 7p. Albert E. Sharp, for example, suggests pre-tax earnings this year of Pounds 125m compared with Pounds 84.2m in 1993-94 before the exceptional items. Second, the exceptional items were not as fierce as they first looked. 'Only 40 per cent of the provisions taken against profits have a direct cash implication, and this will be partially offset by the expected proceeds from divestments,' said Simpson. Third, the shares carry a yield of about 4.5 per cent, higher than the sector average, and this is helping to hold the price up. Whether the share price will be sustained depends on patience with Simpson and his team. Even he acknowledges it will take two or three years to complete a rationalisation programme and to improve financial performance. There is a familiar look about all this. Lucas has been rationalising or shifting focus - all the vogues - ever since 1981. In 1984-85, it had what reports of the time called 'a comprehensive programme' to jack up efficiency and reduce costs. 'Too many products and too many plants' was the cry then, just as it is now. Lucas seems always to be doing what conventional wisdom suggests it ought to do. It was an early UK exponent of Japanese management systems. In the second half of the 1980s, when it again became more fashionable to diversify, Lucas diversified into the sort of software and systems companies it now cannot wait to sell. Recession pushed it back into trimming mode: 'modernisation of facilities and integration of operations into fewer sites,' it announced in October 1992 as it declared restructuring provisions of Pounds 88.4m, a larger sum than Simpson has put aside for the same purpose. So, what is new about George? He does not present himself as an avenging angel. Rather, he talks of accelerating change. He works off the base of Lucas technological skills: at the hardest times, the group held up its research and development spending. His particular emphasis will be changing the presentation of the technology, giving it what he calls 'market pull'. Lucas will seek not just to present its wares to the market but to fashion its wares to the needs of the market. George Simpson knows about customers.</p>

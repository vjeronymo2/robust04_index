			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: BAe rises on sales hopes SPECULATION of a lucrative order and news of an improvement in car sales sent British Aerospace sharply forward yesterday. Talk heard last week that Saudi Arabia was about to announce a substantial order for Airbus aircraft gathered momentum, with the order said to be for both the A320 and A340 aircraft. Buyers were further attracted by news that sales of Rover cars rose by 13 per cent in the first half of this year, above market expectations. Analysts also predicted that the company's regional jets joint venture with Taiwan Aerospace was about to be completed. Yesterday the stock surged ahead 15 to 420p in brisk trade of 5.3m shares. Mr Keith Hodgkinson at Lehman Brothers believes the shares will remain in the 400p to 450p trading range in the near future and predicted that they will rise to more than 500p next year.</p>

			<p><P> March 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TOKYO STOCKS PLUNGE BUT RECOVER HALF OF LOSS  </P> <P> Stock prices plummeted on the Tokyo Stock Exchange this morning, with the  Nikkei index taking a free-fall through the symbolic 30,000-point barrier  before rebounding significantly in an afternoon rally to close at 29,843.34,  down 963.85 points.  </P> <P> As investors lost confidence in the strength of the yen and in the ability of  financial authorities to stabilize the currency and securities markets, the  Nikkei collapsed by more than 1,800 points in the morning session to reach its  lowest level -- 28,971.12 -- since November, 1988.  </P> <P> Even with the afternoon rally, in which the index recovered 869 points, the  day's trading underscored an increasingly pessimistic mood in Kabutocho, or  Japan's Wall Street.  </P> <P> The loss represented a 3.1% decline in the Nikkei from its finish Tuesday, when  it fell 456.05 points on the eve of a national holiday Wednesday when markets  were closed.  </P> <P> Although some brokers warned of a "melt-down scenario" seizing the stock  market, the world's largest in terms of capitalization, others noted that  volume remained relatively low and that an atmosphere of crisis had not set in  on the trading floor.  </P> <P> "I'd say we're not seeing panic yet," said Lynne Ross, director of equity  research in Tokyo for the French brokerage, W.I. Carr. "But there's a definite  lack of confidence in the government's ability to restore stability in bonds,  and to back up the yen."  </P> <P> The dollar was changing hands at above 155 yen in morning trading, higher than  the 154.65 close in New York on Wednesday, reflecting speculation that the  Japanese currency would continue to weaken despite Tuesday's 1 percentage point  hike in the official discount rate by the Bank of Japan. The dollar had closed  here Tuesday at 153.65 yen.  </P> <P> In a vicious circle, stock prices declined on pessimism over the strength of  the yen, which in turn lost value because of the trouble in the stock market,  traders and analysts said. Dealers also reportedly bought dollars on remarks by  Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady that a stronger U.S. currency would be  tolerated.  </P> <P> Intervention by the Bank of Japan -- which reportedly sold $700 million worth  of greenbacks this morning -- failed to stem the yen's decline, which was  traded at its lowest level in more than three years.  </P> <P> Finance Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto confirmed today that he would fly to  Washington over the weekend to meet with Brady to discuss foreign exchange  policy coordination and financial issues under discussion in the Structural  Impediments Initiative talks.  </P> <P> But on the whole, authorities reacted coolly to the continued bearishness in  the stock market -- where the Nikkei average has lost 23% of its value since  the market peaked at 38,915.87 on Dec. 29. By comparison, the Nikkei shed only  about 21% during the global stock panic of October, 1987.  </P></p>

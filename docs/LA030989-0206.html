			<p><P> March 9, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> STATE;  </P> <P> PROSECUTOR SHOOTS SELF TO DEATH  </P> <P> Dist. Atty. Ronald Tepper of El Dorado County was found shot to death in his  downtown office today and Placerville Police Chief Bob Harmon said the  prosecutor committed suicide.  </P> <P> Tepper, 54, was found with a head wound by a district attorney's investigator.  There was no note explaining the shooting, Harmon said.  </P> <P> Tepper, who was married, had been involved lately in the prosecution of El  Dorado County Supervisor Michael Visman, who was to be arraigned in U.S.  District Court in Sacramento later today on marijuana cultivation charges.  Tepper asked to have the trial shifted from the county to U.S. District Court  after a challenge to his prosecution of the case. Visman's attorney charged  that Tepper had a longstanding grudge against his client. He said Tepper  insisted on going through with a court hearing to review evidence in the case  to further damage Visman.  </P></p>

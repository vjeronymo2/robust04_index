			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Central Bank Codirector Maria Mercedes </F> Cuellar by Luis Alberto Lopera: "The Government Has To Tighten  Its Belt"; place and date not given]    [Text] The Colombian economy is adjusting, as a result of  which problems involving increased credit, inflation, and  greater revaluation must be solved.    If the national government does not check public spending,  the Colombian economy could face serious difficulties in the  months ahead.    Measures adopted by the Bank of the Republic's board of  directors guarantee that private spending will be checked  substantially by controls placed on domestic credits and  obstacles preventing businessmen from building up foreign debts.  However, such measures will yield positive results only if the  government does its part.    This warning comes from Maria Mercedes Cuellar de Martinez,  codirector of the Bank of the Republic, who said that if things  go well, the economy will return to normal performance in a  matter of months.    In an interview with EL TIEMPO, the issuing institute  official said that the restriction placed on credit is not as  tight as it appears to be because growth in loans of slightly  more than 30 percent a year is more than sufficient based on the  anticipated growth of the economy.    She said the measures would not be revised for the UPAC  [constant purchasing power unit] system because there has been  some price speculation in the construction sector due to the  fact that it does not have sufficient capacity to meet the  demand that has emerged in recent years.    She also said the country cannot afford the luxury of  maintaining an undervalued exchange rate, noting that an ideal  devaluation would be between 12 and 13 percent rather than the 8  percent to which it has fallen in recent weeks.    [Lopera] Why did credit shoot up and why did you take such a  drastic measure to halt it?    [Cuellar] By mid-February, credit had quieted down and was  growing in keeping with the anticipated parameter of 35 percent  annually. This was an acceptable rate given last year's growth  of over 50 percent.    During the last week of February and the early weeks of  March, however, outlays of the financial system rose sharply. If  things had continued as they were, we would have risen to a rate  of over 60 percent or more for the year as a whole, an  unmanageable figure.    That is why, following a great deal of discussion and  analysis of what was happening, the board met and decided to  control domestic credit and place restraints on the possibility  of contracting debts abroad.    [Lopera] If businesses have gone so far into debt with  international banks, why was credit growing so fast? Are these  consumer loans?    [Cuellar] Financial credit is not only growing, but is also  being democratized, which is very good for the economy because  it shows that the reform of the financial sector is yielding  results.    What is happening is that business has begun to redirect its  efforts. Since the doors were opened last year for private debts  abroad, the financial institutions had to go after other  customers.    There is one very important additional fact however,.  Businesses had previously set up chains of credit for others and  we did not know how much interest they were collecting.  According to reports from the Superintendency of Securities,  enormous profits were made in this way, but the action of that  middleman has now been curtailed.    [Lopera] Is it merely a problem of greater demand, or what  is  truly happening to the handling of the economy?    [Cuellar] What is happening is that the economy is adjusting  and growth in credits is part of that adjustment. The problem is  that while it is true that it is a very good process, the  readjustment is happening too quickly and has generated other  phenomena that we have to control, such as fast growth in means  of payment (money in the hands of the public and current  accounts). Monetary and exchange control is more difficult in an  open economy.    [Lopera] What are these phenomena and how do you intend to  attack them?    [Cuellar] Four problems have emerged. On the one hand, there  is strong inflationary pressure, and the Bank of the Republic  had to intervene with credit. That is a political and economic  decision. Second, problems with the rate of exchange persist,  and in the board's judgment we must protect Colombian exporters'  ability to compete.    In addition, we have to begin to analyze why credit is  growing so much: Is it because there is more income or because  people are saving less? We now have evidence that the level of  savings is dropping and that the financial system has more  delinquent loans.    Fourth, there is excessive spending, both public and  private.  In the case of the former, the government is now pledging to  postpone more spending, and temporary controls placed on credit  will slow down growth in private spending. In order for the  measures to function properly and be temporary, we must reduce  spending on these two fronts.    [Lopera] But is that measure not very drastic and does it  not  cause many problems precisely at a time when the economy is  being opened up?    [Cuellar] By law, monetary authorities cannot restrict  credit  for over 120 days (four months), but I do not think the decision  implies any great restriction of the ministry in view of what  the economy needs for good growth. Furthermore, borrowing abroad  was not completely stopped, as some thought.    Postponing government spending is necessary because it rose  11 percent in real terms last year. It is estimated that this  year, there could be a nominal increase of 37 percent in the  Central Government alone.    [Lopera] Finally, is the government cutting or postponing  spending? What kind of an agreement did the minister of finance  make with the board?    [Cuellar] The government could end the year with a fiscal  surplus of 500 billion pesos, equivalent to 1 percent of the  gross domestic product (GDP). Without counting revenue from the  cellular telephone and privatizations, the economy could end up  balanced.    An estimated 100 billion pesos of those resources would be  obtained as a result of greater efficiency in collecting taxes,  plus another 200 billion by cutting or postponing spending. The  remaining 200 billion could be "saved" by certain problems  anticipated for the months ahead. The first is the Medellin  Metro. The second is the fact that since the Statute on  Administrative Hiring has just been signed, the signing of a few  contracts has been postponed.    [Lopera] And what if the some 369 billion pesos in  postponements and cuts announced at the beginning of the year  cannot be made?    [Cuellar] If the government does not make those cuts and  postponements, the situation may become more complicated in the  months ahead. Nevertheless, we must remember that it is easier  to cut or postpone spending in the Central Government, which is  not the case at the other two levels: the decentralized and  local levels, which are more difficult to control.    [Lopera] Do you think that with the check on foreign credit,  we can truly avoid a revaluation of the peso? How much of a  devaluation should be made in order not to discourage exporters?    [Cuellar] The country cannot afford the luxury of  maintaining  an undervalued rate of exchange. While it is true that there is  no problem in short-range terms, we cannot allow this to go on  for long. The real rate of exchange is already slightly below  100 points and the devaluation is at about 8 percent.    We hope that with reduced revenue in dollars and prepayments  on the foreign debt that are being made, apart from greater  control on the issuance of bonds in order to attract resources  abroad, we will check the revaluation process.    The ideal devaluation rate would be between 12 and 13  percent.    [Lopera] It is argued that money laundering has risen  greatly. Is that already reflected in international reserves?    [Cuellar] I do not know where such stories start or how they  can measure such money laundering. So far this year,  international reserves have grown only by about $110 million.    [Lopera] When credit was closed, it was said that the  measure  was an alarm for the financial system because there are more and  more delinquent loans. What can you tell us?    [Cuellar] That is true. Loans due and payable are growing at  such an alarming rate that according to one FEDESARROLLO  [Federation for Development] study, loans six months overdue had  risen by 66 percent! The financial sector will have to be more  careful in handling its portfolio in order to avoid a repeat of  what the country went through in the early 1980's.    [Lopera] The construction sector and particularly the  savings  and housing corporations are very unhappy with the restriction  on credit because they are the ones who will feel the effects  the most. Do you expect to adjust the rules to facilitate their  operations?    [Cuellar] What is happening in the construction sector is  that it has been unable to meet the high demand. They do not  have sufficient, which is generating some price speculation.  Housing construction costs are among those that have risen the  most since last year because neither the cementworks nor the  brickyards are providing an adequate supply, and the producers  of other types of goods are in the same situation.    If they cannot meet demand, they can perfectly well sell  less  without putting upward pressure on prices for such goods.</p>

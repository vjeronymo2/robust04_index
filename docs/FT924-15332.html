			<p>921005 FT  05 OCT 92 / Survey of Technology in the Office (2): An explosion of activity - Portable Computers IN its infancy, portable computing was only for the really dedicated. The first transportable computers were heavyweight, bulky, mains-powered machines with tiny screens, large floppy disk drives and less memory than many of today's pocket electronic organisers. But in the past five years computing on the move has become a realistic business option as rapid advances in technology have provided the ability to pack large amounts of processing power and big slabs of memory into shrinking packages which sell for ever-decreasing prices. 'Transportables' were replaced by 'laptops' which have now been replaced themselves 'notebooks,' 'sub-notebooks' and even 'palmtop' computers. Today 'the office portable' is likely to be a high-power, full-function computer in a clam-shell case no bigger than a thick pad of A4 paper and weighing less than 3kg. Although most notebook computers still have monochrome displays, many manufacturers now offer top-of-the-range models with high-definition colour screens, as well as hard disks and the latest Intel 486 microprocessors. As prices drop, the colour notebook sector is likely to be the fastest moving within the notebook market. A recent survey carried out by PC manufacturer AST and What Micro? magazine in the UK shows that price and application requirements are driving the colour notebook market. Nearly 90 per cent of respondents said colour notebooks provided a practical solution to their application requirements. And 65 per cent said price reductions would encourage them to buy colour notebooks. The most popular application for colour notebook PCs is word processing, mentioned by 88 per cent of respondents. This is followed by graphics (66 per cent), databases (64 per cent) and spreadsheets (62 per cent). Surging sales of notebook PCs have already given the flagging desktop PC market a boost, although with prices tumbling, it is consumers rather than manufacturers who have gained. In the UK last year, notebook computer shipments more than trebled to 75,000 units worth about Pounds 87m, according to market estimates. This sales boom has produced an explosion of activity among manufacturers, assemblers and retailers. Only a few companies such as Toshiba, whose machines provide the benchmark by which others are often judged, have managed to carve out significant shares of the market. Figures from Romtec, the market consultancy, give Toshiba 30 per cent of the UK notebook market and 39 per cent of the overall UK portable computer market. A standard notebook based upon Intel's popular 80386SX chip can now be bought for well under Pounds 1,000, colour machines can be bought for a few hundred pounds more, and the gap in price-performance between portable and equivalent desktop computers is continuing to narrow. Members of the latest generation of notebook PCs are able to run the same power and memory-hungry programs - such as Microsoft's popular Windows - that run on the office desktop and can therefore be fully integrated into a company's computer systems. Data can be transferred between the notebook computer and the office system by exchanging floppy discs or PCMCIA memory cards, hard wire or local area network (LAN) connections, or over a telephone line using a modem. UK-based Portable PC Peripherals has even developed an internal card for Compaq laptops and notebooks which allows direct connection to IBM mainframes. Some portable PCs have even been designed to lock into a desktop 'docking station,' allowing them to be used with superior screens and keyboards if required and to hook into the office LAN, sharing software and hardware devices. Even machines without this facility can be an attractive option for offices where desktop space is at a premium. But the principal attraction of a portable computer for most users is its portability, even though research suggests relatively few portable computer buyers actually use their machines while travelling. Surveys have consistently shown that most portable computers are used either in the office or at home, but rarely actually on the move. One reason for this may be that although notebook computers have themselves got thinner and lighter, they can still take up a large chunk of a briefcase. Manufacturers such as Italy's Olivetti and Vortec, part of Korea's Samsung group, have recently responded by introducing a new class of lightweight sub-notebook or A-5 sized machines. These new machines feature large-sized LCD screens, only slightly scaled-down Qwerty keyboards, hard-disk storage and full desktop PC compatibility all squeezed into a small 1kg package. However some established portable PC manufacturers question whether there is a market for the new A5 machines. They point out that lighter and cheaper notebooks and more sophisticated palmtops, such as the PC-compatible Sharp PC 3000 which can fit in a large pocket, have already arrived. Another potentially limiting feature of portable computers has been their relatively short battery life, often only between one and four hours under normal use. However this too is changing with low-power processors, sophisticated power management software, and innovations in battery technology itself. Market analysts also believe portable PCs will become more versatile and more application-specific with the addition of communications capabilities such as paging, remote wireless networking, and fax-modems. Demand for notebook PCs has already fueled sales of other portable office equipment such as printers and is likely to help sales of new digital cellular telephones in the next few years. The trend towards portable computers fits into a broader move towards more compact integrated office equipment. A more mobile workforce requires more mobile equipment which can be used in the office, on site or at home.</p>

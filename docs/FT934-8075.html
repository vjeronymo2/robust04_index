			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Ascot cuts deficit to Pounds 0.6m ASCOT HOLDINGS, the debt-laden property, brewing and leisure company formerly known as Control Securities, cut pre-tax losses from Pounds 68.5m to Pounds 555,0000 in the six months to September 30. Profits in the comparative period were struck after a Pounds 51.8m write-down of assets. The company finalised a financial restructuring in June in the wake of difficulties which began in 1991 when the Serious Fraud Office investigation into the Bank of Credit and Commerce International led to charges against Mr Nazmu Virani, who subsequently resigned as chairman and chief executive of Control Securities. The shares were suspended and a review of asset valuations caused the company to breach borrowing covenants after substantial property write-downs. Net borrowings at the half way stage stood at Pounds 197.5m (Pounds 234.3m) following 30 property disposals and the conversion of about a quarter of the company's Pounds 75m worth of Eurobonds into preference shares. The balance sheet shows a negative net worth of Pounds 18.6m (Pounds 31.8m). The shares, which resumed trading on June 30, yesterday closed up  1/2 p at 5 1/4 p. The year-end results were qualified. A review report on the interim figures by Parnell Kerr Forster, the auditors, noted that continued trading required the support of the company's bankers and other creditors. As part of the financial restructuring the company's bankers have agreed, under their standstill agreement, to continue existing facilities to the company for a year to June 16 1994. Turnover rose to Pounds 48.9m (Pounds 47.8m). Operating profits of Pounds 10m (Pounds 3.25m) reflected lower exchange losses of Pounds 3.45m (Pounds 12.6m) on the Swiss Franc bonds, improvements in the hotel and brewing operations and a decline in pubs and property. Interest charges fell to Pounds 11m (Pounds 17.3m). Losses per share were 0.6p (16.7p).</p>

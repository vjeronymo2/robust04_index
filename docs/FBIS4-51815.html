			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 27 (YONHAP) -- Korean companies were  participating in seven oil development projects in five  countries -- Indonesia, Yemen, Egypt, Argentina and Venezuela --  as of the end of March, the vice chairman of the Overseas  Petroleum Development Association said Wednesday at a seminar in  the Korea exhibition center, southern Seoul.    Yun Sok-ku said 18 Korean companies, including Korea  Petroleum Development Corp., are exploring for oil in 18  projects in 14 countries.    Korean firms have spent 1.2 billion U.S. dollars on oil  development projects abroad and registered an income of 910  million dollars from them, scoring a 75-percent recovery rate.  But since the regions being explored for oil are becoming more  remote and deeper in the sea, the success rate has declined and  the investment cost risen, he said.    Yun called on the government to help boost overseas oil  development by increasing financial assistance, educating  personnel and building up a comprehensive information network.</p>

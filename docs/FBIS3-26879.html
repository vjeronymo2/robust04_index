It is not so, said the U.S. Trade Representative Mickey  Kantor. "This is an extremely important issue that goes to the  heart of this administration," he told a packed press conference  this afternoon.    After the failed summit last Friday [11 February], when  President Bill Clinton and Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa failed to agree on a trade framework, cellular phones,  for the U.S., show how difficult it is to enter the Japanese  market.    Accusing Tokyo of violating a 1989 agreement to buy more  U.S.-made cellular phones, Washington hinted today at trade  sanctions against Japan, whose trade surplus with the U.S.  surpassed 60 billion U.S. dollars in 1993.    "The Japanese Government created a situation favoring  existing Japanese suppliers over any potential U.S. competitor,"  Christopher Galvin, Motorola's president, told a press  conference following Kantor's announcement.    For President Clinton, the issue of cellular phone was  "illustrative of our general problems" with Japan. Motorola,  with leading edge in cellular phone technologies, sells 40  percent of such phones in the world.    In 1989, Japan agreed to let U.S.-made cellular phones enter  its domestic markets, and the share in Japan's market by the  Schaumberg, Illinois-based Motorola is supposed to reach one  third to 50 percent by February 15, 1994.    "Despite an accord with Japan that was designed to open the  cellular telephone markets, we still find ourselves struggling  to gain access to Japanese market," Galvin said.    The issue of cellular phones has nothing to do with the  trade  framework talks between U.S. and Japan, although it coincided  with the summit, whose failure is the first of its kind since  the end of the second world war.    During the eight-month old trade talks, U.S. asked to set  numerical standards to evaluate the open nature of the Japanese  market. Naming it managed trade, Tokyo said no and withdrew  from the talks.    The Americans are especially angry at the difficulty to  enter  Japan's markets of telecommunications, medical equipment, auto  and auto parts, and insurance services, the four priority areas  in the framework talks.    Noting that some Japanese officials blamed the lack of  competitiveness as a reason for limited success of foreign  producers in Japan, Kantor called the excuse "false and  disingenuous."    Administration officials refused to anticipate if a full  scale trade war with Japan is in breed, given the fact that such  a conflict will impact not only Japanese companies but also  American firms since the two countries are inextricably tied  together in economies.    "We are doing a thorough evaluation. We are moving with our  deliberate speeds on this issue," said Commerce Secretary Ron  Brown.    He said recent comments by the administration are "very  serious" and are not threatening words. "We're going to be  consistent and insistent that American products, goods and  services have an opportunity to compete fairly in Japanese  markets."    Observers, meanwhile, listed many options facing the Clinton  administration, including the revival of the Super 301 Trade  Law, which asks the government to review unfair trade practices  by foreign countries on an annual basis and impose sanctions in  designated time.    President Clinton is reportedly going to issue an executive  order this week to revive the trade law, which, in the late  1980's, was used to pry open Japan's markets of super computer,  satellite and timber products.    The U.S. also intends to target the American affiliates of  Japanese firms, some of which are accused of violating the  anti-trust laws in the country, and to eye the European Union  for multilateral approach in pressing Japan for move concessions  in trade.    "We have a number of options in order to make sure we open  markets in Japan. That's our goal," Kantor said. "All we are  asking is for two-way street."</p>

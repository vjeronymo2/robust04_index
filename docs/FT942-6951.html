			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / Ifil plans issue to pay for expansion Ifil, the Italian industrial holding company indirectly controlled by the Agnelli family, is to raise at least L800bn (Pounds 334m) with a complex share and bond issue to fund expansion in the retailing and agro-food busi-ness. Ifil's board also approved yesterday an investment of about L400bn in convertible bonds, which will give the holding company a 10-year option to buy a controlling stake in Unicem, the Agnellis' cement business. The 50.4 per cent stake currently belongs to Ifil's parent company Ifi, and the operation prepares the way for a reshuffling of Agnelli interests which would leave Ifil with most of the family's main industrial activities, except Fiat, the automotive group. Mr Umberto Agnelli, chairman of Ifil and deputy chairman and chief executive of Ifi, said yesterday that the operation had a dual purpose: 'On the one hand it confirms our interest in development opportunities in our own country, on the other it accelerates the clarification of the holding companies' role.' He added that Ifi would remain the financial holding company, with a 'direct and indirect institutional presence' in Fiat. Ifil's holdings include a stake in Gruppo Rinascente, the Italian stores chain, which is one of the potential buyers of Italy's state-owned retailing and restaurant interests. The group's consolidated net profits rose to L231.2bn from L192.8bn in 1993, the company announced yesterday.</p>

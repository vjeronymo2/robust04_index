			<p><P> April 7, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ONLY IN L.A.  </P> <P> You wouldn't expect a tour guide to wear tattered jeans and sport a somber  expression framed by long hair and an even longer beard. Except, perhaps, in  free-form Venice, where ex-hippie Joe Sigler fits in perfectly.  </P> <P> His business card is a matchbook from the nearby Sidewalk Cafe on Ocean Front  Walk. He waits there each day for passers-by to stop at his display -- "Joe's  Venice Walking Tours."  </P> <P> A resident for 33 years, the affable Joe needs no script. He'll set out in any  direction, tailoring his one-hour commentary to the customer. He can lecture on  the murals, such as Rip Cronk's "Venice Reconstituted," which depicts several  characters (including Joe). Or the one-time haunts of the celebrities, like  Charlie Chaplin's penthouse in the Waldorf Hotel. Or Venice's hideaways, such  as the tunnels used by rum runners during Prohibition.  </P> <P> Joe, age 48, doesn't sugar-coat his lecture. Take the story of why he abandoned  his old job as a one-man motorcycle errand service. Someone stole his  motorcycle.  </P> <P> Just when it looked as though L.A. was joining the Cultural Big Leagues, with  the Getty Museum purchase of Van Gogh's "Irises," the town's other Van Gogh is  covered over.  </P> <P> It's "Starry Night," as rendered by Scott Dosch on a mural near Joe's station  off Ocean Front Walk. A Bob Dylan mural was recently slapped over it.  </P> <P> Dylan isn't exactly a sensation these days. Then, again, a whole block of shops  in that area seem to have experienced some sort of LSD flashback.  </P> <P> Storefronts bear '60s bumper stickers with such utterances as "Goldwater for  Halloween," newspaper clippings of old anti-police demonstrations, and posters  of long-dead heroes, like comic Lennie Bruce. There's even an incense-filled  "head" shop.  </P> <P> What's going on?  </P> <P> It turns out that the Dylan mural and all the rest are props for a coming movie  about Jim Morrison.  </P> <P> Once the filming's done, the temporary unreality will give way to the true  unreality.  </P> <P> You mean they didn't already have a rule?:  </P> <P> The South Coast Air Quality Management District wins our award for most  disturbing local press release of the day (week/month/year) with this little  bombshell:  </P> <P> "Air quality officials today committed to developing a rule to phase out by  1995 the use of a deadly gas at five major industrial facilities in L.A. County  that could engulf thousands of people in a toxic cloud in the event of a major  leak."  </P> <P> Al Hix of Hollywood wonders if L.A. has the only dress code for taxi drivers  that found it necessary to state that skirts would be restricted to female  cabbies.  </P> <P> MiscelLAny:  </P> <P> Why would anyone call a chili dog stand Pink's? It's a question heard more than  a few times through the years by the founders of the half-century-old Hollywood  eatery, Paul and Betty Pink.  </P></p>

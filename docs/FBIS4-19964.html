			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Livia Klingl: "Discrepancy Between Words and </F> Deeds"]    [Text] "Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin have basically  reached agreement." At first glance, this piece of news gave  rise to hope one day after the speech by the President, who is  acting rather lucklessly in the sphere of foreign policy, on the  situation in Bosnia. Yet the reputations of the United States,  of the United Nations, of the European Union, and of NATO are  linked to this speech.    One may have gotten the impression that Russia has now also  adopted a tough stance vis-a-vis the Serbian troops. Yet  agreement has only been achieved with the unwilling and would-be  superpower on the convening of an international Bosnia  conference.    It is obvious that it will take some time to ensure the  participation of all major politicians and of the Serbian  leaders that have been made important by these major  politicians. It is equally obvious that Bosnian civilians will  die in the meantime.    In an initial reaction, the nationalist leader (or seducer)  Karadzic was "unimpressed" by Clinton's initiative. After all,  the obstacles on the path toward a more massive military strike  by NATO have remained the old ones: Blue berets would become  hostages -- as recent events have shown on a small scale. Much  weightier is the argument of military officials that soldiers  have never surrendered to an aircraft, and that the war cannot  be won without ground troops.    The U.S. leader, who may have been genuinely outraged by the  Bosnian atrocities, has reacted to public pressure. However,  his initiative can only be effective if the allies really  cooperate. Possible consequences that no Western head of state  has been prepared to risk so far, would have to be accepted.    Clinton's statement that "we must judge the Serbs by their  deeds and not by their words" must also apply to the community  of states. The Serbs have been using this motto for a long time.  When the ultimatum for Sarajevo was adopted -- the only one  that was taken seriously by the world -- they were even  impressed.</p>

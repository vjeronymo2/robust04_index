			<p>BFN     [Text] The Mainland Affairs Council Tuesday [14 June]  denied reports that Taiwan is preparing to upgrade cross strait  relations to allow direct trade.    According to media reports, the council has churned out a  document to propose that the government proceed into the second  phase of the National Reunification Guidelines next year. The  second phase of the guidelines allows official exchanges in  direct trade between Taiwan and Mainland China, which are  currently banned. The first phase currently in effect only  allows indirect trade and civilian contacts.    The media reports said: The council has made a proposal  anticipating Taiwan will join the General Agreement on Tariff  and Trade at the end of the year.    A council spokesman stressed: Only after Peking recognizes  Taipei as a political entity and stops isolating Taiwan  internationally will the government here proceed into the second  phase of the National Reunification Guidelines.</p>

			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / UK Company News: McCarthy &amp; Stone calls for Pounds 15.5m and forecasts reduced interim losses McCarthy &amp; Stone, Britain's biggest builder of retirement homes, yesterday announced a Pounds 15.5m rights issue to reduce borrowings and buy land. The company also is proposing to cancel Pounds 2.63m of dividend arrears owed to cumulative preference shareholders who are being offered a scrip issue of one new preference share for every 5.509 preference shares already held. McCarthy said that in the present circumstances it would be unlikely 'to pay off these arrears for some considerable time'. The rights issue of 28m shares is on the basis of 2-for-5 at 58p. The shares rose 1p to 73p following the announcement. McCarthy, which is experiencing an upturn in demand, expects losses before tax and exceptionals for the six months to end-February to fall from Pounds 5.7m to no more than Pounds 1.3m. The average price for its homes has risen from Pounds 56,600 to Pounds 64,500 during the past 12 months. McCarthy said it intended to resume payments of preference dividends following publication of results for the year to August 31, depending on a further revision of banking facilities. The issue is underwritten by NatWest Markets Corporate Finance. COMMENT This looks like a further refinancing given the admission that the company would be unable to pay off arrears without a scrip issue. An early resumption of preference dividends, moreover, looks dependent on a successful rights. On the other hand, most of the group's competitors have disappeared from a market which will command higher margins than general housebuilding as it recovers. At the rights issue price the group remains on a p/e of 25 on 1994-95 pre-tax profits of Pounds 4.8m, which may not be announced for 18 months. Shareholders probably have little choice other than to take up their rights but should not buy in the market.</p>

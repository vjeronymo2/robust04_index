			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / Technology: Prometheus unbound - A look at progress in Europe's traffic technology project Prometheus, say supporters, is alive and well and will prove it in Paris next October when the EU's leading indigenous vehicle makers and close associates in electronics and components will demonstrate, for the first time in three years, their progress under one of the region's biggest collaborative research programmes. Prometheus stands, in this case, not for the ill-fated thief of fire from the gods, but Programme for a European Traffic with Highest Efficiency and Unprecedented Safety. The Paris exposition will show more of the wide variety of technology - some of it in vehicles which can be driven - which has been developed since Prometheus first began in 1986. It ranges from systems allowing drivers to 'see' through dark and fog, to ultra-sophisticated route guidance and congestion avoidance systems. The research and development engineers and scientists engaged in Prometheus have, by agreement, worked mostly behind closed doors since the first display of the technology's potential in Turin in late 1991. That was largely to convince technocrats from both Brussels and individual governments that funding of Prometheus to the tune of some Ecu90m (Pounds 69m) a year was worthwhile. Renewed funding commitments are required from the end of next year and industry participants say progress is such that refusal will be difficult. If Prometheus achieves its goals, the EU's 50,000 road deaths a year will be halved and transport efficiency, measured by traffic flows, increased by a third by 2010. The October exhibition will also be used to announce the next phase of Prometheus - and potentially its most significant in terms of the technology's availability both to drivers and within the transport infrastructure. This is because the bulk of the technology is unlikely to be made commercially available before the end of the decade. This will be later than first hoped when Prometheus was beginning in the late 1980s, but nevertheless is not surprising given the inevitable delays and complications of developing such technologies from basic concepts. For the momentum of Prometheus to be sustained, say the 20 industry participants, not only must the EU be prepared to continue funding - although two-thirds of the project is already financed by the industries involved - but governments and Brussels must make greater progress in defining a co-ordinated transport strategy for Europe. 'Prometheus certainly cannot solve all the transport and traffic problems on its own; technical measures must be accompanied by social concepts that allow the reduction of traffic peaks, improve traffic efficiency and reduce the need for mobility. That includes more flexible shop hours as well as spreading working hours,' warns a strategy document on the direction of Prometheus from the end of this year. A few technologies are already starting to move away from the Prometheus programme, which is seen as strictly non-competitive, collaborative research, towards commercialisation. These include basic vision enhancement, through the use of ultra-violet light in headlamps and fluorescent road markings, and an emergency call system based on the GSM satellite communications network. Field trials of the ultra-violet system have begun in Sweden, where it has been mainly developed by Volvo and Saab. Similarly, the emergency call system was being tested throughout last year. It allows for the automatic location by emergency services of a crashed vehicle. The location system illustrates the way in which Prometheus technology can overlap as it can form part of other systems such as satellite-based fleet management and automatic route guidance. If a final format can be agreed, the system could be in use by 1995.</p>

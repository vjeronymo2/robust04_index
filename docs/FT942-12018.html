			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / Arts: Native Czech While Prague's two opera companies show waning enthusiasm for the native repertoire, there is still plenty of Czech music to be heard in the city's lovely concert halls, much of it little known in the West. Two recent programmes found the Czech Philharmonic Orchestra tackling works by Vorisek and Novak, and the Prague Symphony accompanying a mass by Ilja Hurnik (b1922). Both were well attended and warmly received by local concert-goers, suggesting that the tourist market does not yet have a monopoly on all cultural life in the Czech capital. The most rewarding discovery was Hurnik's Missa Vinea Crucis, premiered two years ago with organ accompaniment. Hurnik's music is well established in the Czech Republic and deserves a wider reputation. The Mass is a tonal work, clean-textured and full of subtle harmonic modulations, drawing its inspiration from Hurnik's north Moravian folk roots and the Janacek-Martinu tradition, rather than the glum postwar school of Czech modernism. The opening Kyrie, a pure pastoral air, sets an optimistic tone. The Gloria, Credo and Sanctus include spiky interjections for chamber orchestra (no brass), while the Agnus captures some of the otherworldly atmosphere of Messiaen's L'Ascension. The final Deo gratias has a lively rhythmic pull. The 80-strong Permonik Children's Chorus, which commissioned the work, sang without blemish, but could have added more bite. This luxurious opener to the Prague Symphony Orchestra's concert in the Smetana Hall was followed by an inspired account of Shostakovich's First Cello Concerto by Frans Helmerson and Debussy's La Mer. Martin Turnovsky conducted all three with idiomatic flair. Hurnik was one of the many composition pupils of Vitezslav Novak (1870-1949), whose own music has been well represented in the Czech Philharmonic's programmes this season. I heard the song cycle Valley of the New Kingdom for baritone and orchestra (1903), based on a text by Antonin Sova. It is infused with impressionist touches, late Romantic colours and lyrical poetry, and it could have made a kind of Czech Sea Pictures, if the four songs had not been so short - a mere 13 minutes. The music found a heroic upper extension in Ivan Kusnjer's lusty voice. Oliver Dohnanyi, making his Czech Philharmonic debut in the Dvorak Hall, conducted a robust account of Vorisek's D major Symphony, and ended the programme with Dvorak's Symphonic Variations, infused with all the tonal bloom and beauty for which Czech orchestras are renowned.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 22 (XINHUA) -- Sales volume of  supermarkets in the Chinese capital have achieved an  increasingly high proportion in the total retail sales volume in  Beijing.    Statistics from the Beijing municipal commercial commission  show that the transaction volume in 27 supermarkets in Beijing  topped 100 million yuan last year. In 1992, there were just 15  supermarkets.    Total sales volume of the 27 supermarkets reached 9.465  billion yuan, accounting for 17.2 percent of Beijing's total  retail sales volume last year.    Commercial experts said that large department stores are  winning more customers and playing an increasingly important  role in market competition as they have the priority in market  information, feedback and power.    A series of reforms has been carried out in the major stores  involving labor, personnel and distribution. Employees'  enthusiasm was greatly increased as reforms were promoted in  such commercial groups as the Beijing Department Store, the  Xidan Department Store, the Dongan Market and the Beijing  Friendship Store.    In addition, a dozen new supermarkets are catching up. The  Lufthansa Friendship Commercial Center, the Scite Tower, the  County and Township Trade Center, Xidan Shopping Center among  others that were built in the past several years have become new  shopping attractions.</p>

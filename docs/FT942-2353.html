			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / People (Names in the News): Saeki to lead Sanwa Bank Though Japanese banks are still suffering from the worst loan crisis since the second world war, Sanwa Bank has taken the business community by surprise by moving up to second place in the list of the country's top earners, writes Emiko Terazono. And behind this rise is Naotaka Saeki, who masterminded Sanwa's drive to cut costs and produce an early recovery in earnings. He takes over as president from Hiroshi Watanabe. Some critics suggest that Saeki may be 'too dry', implying that he disregards the old-boy network, which counts for much in Japan, but he has a strong following within the bank thanks to his straight talking. Having made Sanwa's the largest domestic network, Saeki will now try to change its down-to-earth image engendered by its Osaka industrial base into that of a quality lender.</p>

			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / International Company News: Asarco pauses for breath after its headlong rush - How one US mining group has transformed itself from lumbering copper smelter to integrated copper producer Asarco, the US mining metals group which spent Dollars 1.1bn over the past few years in a headlong rush to transform itself, is pausing for breath to put its balance sheet in better shape. The group has sought to throw off its old image as a lumbering copper-smelter - mainly taking in material from other miners for refining - and assuming that of an integrated copper producer. In 1985, before the transformation got under way, the group could supply only 25 per cent of the copper concentrate - an intermediate material - needed to keep its smelters fully occupied. Today it can supply 100 per cent. Ironically, custom smelters have rarely been more profitable than today. The world is suffering from a smelter bottleneck. Smelters are turning many potential customers away because of an abundance of concentrate and their treatment charges are very high. Mr Richard Osborne, chairman, is not perturbed. 'The world might be short of one copper smelter right now but money and time will take care of that,' he says. Asarco's short-term objectives are to ensure its heavy investments will pay off. 'We must focus to a man on getting operating rates (at mines and smelters) up to where they should be,' says Mr Osborne. Asarco's restructuring took place at an opportune time. Mining properties were available because the US oil companies were disposing of their metals assets. Asarco also spent heavily to improve its own properties. Its Mission mine in Arizona has been expanded by 42 per cent, enabling it to produce some 124,000 tons of copper this year. A 58 per cent expansion of the Ray mine was completed in February this year and it is expected to produce 182,000 tons of copper. A revamp of its El Paso smelter, to increase capacity by 38 per cent, will be finished by 1993. And the redevelopment of its Silver Bell mine as a leach operation is expected to be completed in 1994. The group plans no further acquisitions in 1992. 'We must be careful that we don't take opportunities at too great a pace for the company to absorb. We must let the organisation pause every now and again,' says Mr Osborne. However, he adds quickly: 'But we haven't stopped looking for opportunities.' Meanwhile, Asarco has set about repairing the damage high spending caused to its balance sheet. Its debt has climbed from 26 per cent of equity in 1985 to more than 36 per cent. Mr Osborne says the aim is to reduce it to 25 per cent as quickly as possible. To this end capital spending will drop to about Dollars 100m this year from Dollars 283m in 1991. The dividend payment will be halved, from Dollars 66m to Dollars 33m. Mr Osborne says: 'In a cyclical business like ours, dividends have to bear some relationship to results.' Asarco hopes to sell its 31.2 per cent shareholding in Mexico Desarollo Industrial Minero (Medimsa) for about Dollars 300m cash. Asarco's transformation to an integrated metals group has increased its exposure to the risks of the metals markets. Last year, poor prices for its copper, gold, lead, silver and zinc knocked Dollars 100m off the company's earnings of Dollars 46m, or Dollars 1.12 a share. Continuing low metals prices have postponed the first fruits of the company's metamorphosis. It reported first-quarter net earnings of Dollars 6.9m, or 17 cents a share, down from Dollars 8m, or 20 cents, a year ago. Sales slipped to Dollars 458.4m, from Dollars 465.2m last year. Asarco's new capacity in copper, with 1.5bn tonnes of reserves and 1992 mine production scheduled to be 333,000 tonnes, gives cause for optimism. Profit margins from an integrated mining business are significantly better than those for custom smelting. 'The earnings capacity of Asarco today is much greater than it would have been without these mining assets,' says Mr Osborne.</p>

You have already seen the two assassins on your TV screens.  One of them is Mario Aburto Martinez, 23. There are two  alleged killers. They are already under arrest. One of them  fired at the PRI candidate. He is on screen right now. He is  Mario Aburto Martinez, 23. This morning, the Tijuana State  Prosecutor's Office conducted a Harrison Test on him, and the  test was positive. The Prosecutor's Office reports this confirms  that the suspect had indeed fired a gun.    Preliminary Investigation No. 739-94 initiated in the  killing  of Luis Donaldo Colosio indicates Aburto Martinez used a .38  caliber pistol. The investigation also says the suspect is from  Zamora, Michoacan, where he lived until age 15.    Aburto Martinez said in his initial statement that he is not  going to talk, even if he is tortured. This is in line with the  disdainful disposition that, according to witnesses, he assumed  after attacking the presidential candidate. At the moment of  his apprehension by an angry crowd, he bragged he had fired on  Colosio.    Preliminary investigations have established that the alleged  assassin lives in Mexicali and also has a residence in Tijuana,  that he has four brothers who live in the United States, and  that he works in a mechanic shop in Buenos Aires Norte  neighborhood, in (Mesa de Otay), Tijuana.    He said he is the author of pacifist books that he has  already delivered to the foreign media.    Amid a great deal of secrecy, the Federal Attorney General's  Office is also interrogating Vicente Mayoral Valenzuela, a man  arrested as a witness [testigo]. Mayoral Valenzuela is also  from the border city of Tijuana.    Attorney General Diego Valadez has been in that city since  last night.</p>

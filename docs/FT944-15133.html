			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / Israel firm on peace despite blast: Rabin promises tough measures after 22 die in Tel Aviv bus attack Israel insisted that the Middle East peace process would not be halted by a suicide bomber's attack on a commuter bus in Tel Aviv yesterday that left 22 people dead and 45 wounded. The 9am rush-hour attack by Hamas, which opposes peace with Israel, suggests that the militant Islamic group is intensifying its campaign of violence. The bombing has further divided supporters and opponents of peace among both Israelis and Palestinians. Last night Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli prime minister, said he would take tough measures against Hamas. Mr Rabin, who cut short a visit to Britain after the worst attack on Israelis in 16 years, indicated he would propose measures to cabinet today that would displease human rights groups. He warned that the families and homes of suicide bombers would not be safe. President Bill Clinton said the bombing was 'an outrage against the conscience of the world' and Mr Yassir Arafat, the PLO chairman, condemned the attack and offered to help track down those responsible. Mr Arafat's statement highlighted the growing tension between the PLO and Hamas, which has mounted an open challenge to his authority and vowed to 'set Gaza ablaze' if the PLO continued arresting its members. Israel immediately sealed off the Gaza Strip and West Bank, preventing tens of thousands of Palestinians travelling to their jobs in Israel. Later, 18 Israeli demonstrators were arrested in Jerusalem and an Arab's house was reported to have been set on fire in the West Bank. However, Mr Ephrahim Sneh, Israel's health minister, said the PLO peace talks would not be halted:  'We will continue the day and night war against terrorism. We will fight them and defeat them and kill them, but we are not going to grant Hamas the political victory of stopping the peace process.' The blast came two days after the initialling of a peace treaty between Israel and Jordan, which had raised hopes that political barriers were falling in the Middle East. A signing ceremony is due to be held next week, and Mr Clinton has said he will attend. Israel's opposition rightwing political parties furiously criticised the government in parliament. Mr Benjamin Netanyahu, Likud party leader, said Mr Rabin was responsible for allowing Gaza to become 'a terrorist haven to prepare murderous deeds'. He demanded the construction of a fence around Gaza. Hamas, which last week kidnapped and killed a 19-year-old Israeli soldier, warned of more attacks and said yesterday's bombing had 'lifted the spirits of the Palestinian people'. The bomb blast created carnage and destruction in one of the busiest shopping streets in cosmopolitan Tel Aviv, known for its cafes and boutiques. Bodies, severed limbs, shredded clothes and possessions were strewn across the street near the city's main shopping mall and crushed under the smoking wreckage of the commuter bus. Witnesses said some of the dead had been sitting at outdoor cafes or walking along the street. The bomb threw up flames 40 feet high. 'There was a huge blast and I was lifted off my feet,' said Sarah Pal, in a second-storey apartment opposite the blast. Angry residents gathered, chanting anti-Arab and anti-government slogans. 'We don't want Arabs to come to our city,' said Daniel Minis. 'Gaza must be closed and Rabin should get out.' In a sign of the deep sense of national tragedy, Israelis, for the first time, hung black flags from their balconies - a regular Palestinian mourning ritual. Prof Yona Alexander, a terrorism expert based in Tel Aviv, said the attack underscored Hamas's message that it had 'a long arm and could decide where and when it is going to strike'.

He added that drastic tax reform plans will  compose part of the macroeconomic measures.    Takemura said, "Market-liberalization measures should  naturally contain macroeconomic measures, and my understanding  is that the tax reform plans will be part of them."    He also said 1) the government's plan is to bring the  Japanese- U.S. economic framework talks to a conclusion by June  and that it needs to come up with an idea on what position to  take on tax cuts for next year and thereafter; and 2) the  government will finalize its policy after confirming the views  of the ruling parties.</p>

			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / Arts: A royal feast of Canalettos - Susan Moore reviews the exhibition at the Queen's Gallery HORACE Walpole disparagingly referred to Joseph Smith as 'the merchant of Venice'. It is a soubriquet that fails to do justice to a singular personality who combined the talents of banker and British Consul, bibliophile and publisher, art agent and collector. He amassed the finest array of Canalettos ever and it is our good fortune that he sold it - along with other outstanding paintings, manuscripts, drawings and prints - to the young George III. A King's Purchase: King George III and the Collection of Consul Smith is the latest of the year-long exhibition at the Queen's Gallery devoted to various aspects of the Royal Collection. A less ambitious affair than last year's impressive evocation of the Prince Regent's Carlton House, it is the return home of a selection of Consul Smith's Italian Old Master drawings after an international tour, adapted and extended in form. No new research is offered, and no picture is unveiled for the first time. Yet these morsels constitute a rare feast. A wall or two of 13 out of some 50 Canaletto oils; a Bellini portrait and a Vermeer make for exceptional amuse gueules. It appears to have been the books and manuscripts rather than the works of art that primarily interested both Consul and King. Smith was a knowledgeable collector-cum-dealer, particularly of incunabula, and by the time of his death in 1770 he had amassed a second and no less important collection which sold in nearly 2,000 lots. As founder of the Pasquali Press in Venice, he promoted the engraver's art and also championed the architecture of Palladio, publishing the Quattro Libri in a fine fascimilie edition. Almost as a sideline, he became the agent for Canaletto. Since the opening years of the century He had acted as middleman for British collectors of works of art as well as books and manuscripts, but his relationship with Canaletto developed into that of a modern-day dealer with virtually all of Canaletto's output going directly to him. Their association appears to have begun in the late 1720s when Smith commissioned six large views of the Piazza and Piazetta of S. Marco, possibly to be let into the panelling of his palazzo near the Rialto. Within a decade he was supplying Woburn with its series of 22 small and two large canvases, and his publication of the artist's views of the Grand Canal was drumming up further commissions from home. Anyone who has a jaded view of Canaletto after seeing too many of the late productions of master and workshop should hurry to the Queen's Gallery to refresh their opinion in the face of Canaletto at his most beguiling. Here are two of the five large upright views of the ancient sites of Rome, again probably intended for Smith's palazzo. The clarity of light is breathtaking, and the fluidity of his paint and the liveliness of his touch as he boldly fleshes out his unusually large figures are as vivacious as anything by Tiepolo. Two views of the slate-grey Thames - from the terrace at Somerset House looking towards Westminster and upstream towards St Paul's and a skyline pierced by slender church spires - offer contrasting vignettes of contemporary London life. Yet even these delightful confections look almost dour beside his sparkling view of the Bacino di S. Marco on Ascension Day. There is nothing crabbed or dry about this Canaletto. Consul Smith's is the sole surviving great 18th century Venetian collection. As well as patronising Canaletto, he had acquired most of the best works by the older Sebastiano Ricci and his vast and Veronese-inspired 'Adoration of the Magi' dominates the exhibition space, as is perhaps appropriate for a gallery that began life as a private chapel. The slight, high-key gouaches painted on leather by Ricci's nephew and collaborator Marco - including the delightful 'Courtyard of a Villa' - are minor masterpieces. They, like the late self-portrait of Smith's friend, the Venetian pastellist Rosalba Carriera - broken veins and all - could easily be overlooked on the way out. Smith bought haphazardly, as and when the opportunity arose. One inspired acquisition was the collection of Zaccaria Sagredo in 1752. It brought the Royal Collection the Bellini plus several volumes of Old Master drawings - scantily represented here by Raphael's red chalk 'Massacre of the Innocents' and two sheets (out of an unparalleled group of 200) by Castiglione, drawn with customary bravura in oil paint with the point of a brush. The great surprise is the cache of Dutch and Flemish pictures that Smith acquired when he purchased the collection of GA Pellegrini, an artist who had worked extensively in Northern Europe. The overall uneveness of Smith's collection is typical of the period. Many paintings were not what they purported to be, including all the Titians and Veroneses. Other misattributions proved more serendipitous. One picture from the Pellegrini estate was listed as by Frans Van Mieris and described as 'A Woman playing on a Spinnet in presence of a Man seems to be her father'. Only in the mid-19th century did it come to be revered as a work of the newly rediscovered master, Johannes Vermeer. A King's Purchase continues at the Queen's Gallery, Buckingham Palace, until December 23</p>

			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / Minding Your Own Business: Brothers in business - The Mirpuris are interchangeable, except when it comes to pay The Princess Royal asked: 'Are you going for the hat trick?' as Robert Mirpuri, Managing Director of Magicwell, a North London children's clothing company, proudly received an award for the second year in succession. The occasion was the annual awards dinner of the British Apparel Association of which the Princess is president. The Mirpuri brothers' firm, Magicwell, had just won again the 'Outstanding Export Achievement' award in the childrenswear category. The business was started in 1980, although its roots go back further, and has been built mainly on overseas sales. In 1970, brothers Robert, Harry and Michael Mirpuri, plus a cousin and an uncle, set up a childrenswear shop in south-east London. By 1974 they owned four shops specialising in clothes for 2-12 year olds. Robert recalled: 'Retailing, combined with a little wholesaling, taught us two important lessons - the value of being close to and listening to our customers, and stocking what they wanted, and secondly offering a good service. If we had a good order in the morning, we'd run to the supplier in the afternoon and get the order out on the same day.' In 1980 the three brothers decided to branch out on their own to concentrate on exports, mostly to the Middle East at first. They began above their shop in Islington which they still own. 'It helps us to keep in touch with customers' tastes,' Michael explained. The other shops were sold. During the course of the sale they were impressed by accountant Melvyn Singer of Berg Kaprow Lewis, who has since been a friend and adviser on such key issues as financing growth, revising the capital structure of the company, tax planning and so on. As retailers and wholesalers, the Mirpuri brothers were already selling to visiting Arabs in the mid-70s. Coming from the Sudan they all spoke Arabic and began to appreciate that fashionable children's clothes were becoming a growth market. 'We started making up collections through our supplier contacts,' Harry recalled. 'We went out cold to Kuwait, Bahrain and Dubai. I well remember our first big order was worth Pounds 17,000. In our first year, export sales came to Pounds 132,000. For the next three or four years we doubled this every year.' Now the brothers take it in turn to make at least three overseas trips each year. But while export sales account for about 90 per cent of turnover, more efforts are being made to increase UK sales. Key accounts include Debenhams, House of Fraser, Etam and Fenwick. Total annual turnover has reached Pounds 6m and at the firm's North London office and warehouse the average weekly business of Pounds 125,000 is handled by seven employees and the three brothers. Robert, the eldest, studied production. He looks after marketing and finance  -the latter with advice as required from Melvyn Singer. Harry is responsible for administration, shipping and documentation and Michael handles UK sales. The brothers work closely together. 'We are fully interchangeable,' said Harry. 'Each of us can do the jobs the others do.' But that does not mean they are paid the same. Robert explained: 'We pay ourselves and share profits according to age. That's a traditional Asian custom when businesses are built and run for the benefits of families.' Most of the profits, however, are reinvested to allow for expansion. The Mirpuris' strength is in design and sourcing. They are quick to spot market requirements and tastes, and to develop ideas. Middle Eastern customers like frills and flounces, fussy party frocks and mini three-piece suits. Almost all their ranges, including children's body vests and briefs, lace-trimmed socks and fancy waistcoats are manufactured in the UK by between 30 and 40 companies - many of them small businesses in the Midlands, equally keen to come up with new ideas and to work on those put forward by the brothers. 'It hasn't always been straightforward expansion,' said Robert. 'We've had some very thin times, for instance during the Gulf War and more recently when the pound was very strong. On the other hand we've benefited since Britain came out of the ERM.' The brothers admit their business success owes a debt to their family, not least the entrepreneurial skills of their grandfather. At the turn of the century he set sail from India for South America, then to Alexandria where prospects were said to be better. From there he sailed along the Nile to Port Sudan where he hired a donkey to carry bundles of Chinese silk and Indian curios to the dockside to sell. His sons built on this foundation by opening department stores in the Sudan before coming to England. 'But this,' said Robert, pointing to a bulging storeroom and the rows of frilly childrenswear, 'would have been beyond grandfather's imagination.'

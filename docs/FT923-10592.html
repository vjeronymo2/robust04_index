			<p>920729 FT  29 JUL 92 / International Company News: Samba posts 30% improvement SAUDI American Bank (Samba), the joint-venture Saudi Arabian bank 30 per cent owned by Citicorp, has announced a 46 per cent rise on first-half earnings to Dollars 119.2m over last year's figure. Saudi Arabia's biggest joint venture bank said it had increased earnings in treasury, corporate lending and retail operations. Samba said that it expected a considerable improvement on last year's record earnings of Dollars 200.5m. Deposits grew by 19.3 per cent to Dollars 7.8bn, reflecting a gain in market share in the buoyant Saudi market. Most Saudi banks have reported increased deposits since the end of the Gulf War last year. Net loans and advances grew by 23.4 per cent to Dollars 2.9bn. The bank made a Dollars 4.5m transfer to loan loss reserves, a 31.3 per cent fall on equivalent figures last year. The Bahrain-based offshore Gulf International Bank (GIB) reported a 26.7 per cent rise in first-half earnings to Dollars 25.6m over last year. Assets rose to Dollars 6.2bn from Dollars 5.9bn, while deposits were up over the six months to Dollars 5.6bn from Dollars 5.3bn. GIB, formerly owned by six Gulf governments (Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar) and Iraq, earlier this year shed its Iraqi holding and was effectively taken over by the Gulf Investment Corporation, which is owned by the six Gulf states.</p>

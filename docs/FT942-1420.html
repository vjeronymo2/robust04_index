			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / Queen to give up royal yacht Britannia The Queen will be doing her bit to trim Britain's defence costs by renouncing her right to free private travel in Royal Air Force aeroplanes and giving up the royal yacht Britannia, it was announced yesterday. On the relatively rare occasions when the Queen or her family use RAF aircraft for purely private purposes, they will reimburse the Ministry of Defence for the cost, accord-ing to an MoD statement. The commercial rate for such journeys would be about Pounds 1,770 per hour. Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, said the 41-year-old Britannia would be taken out of service in 1997 and the government would consider whether the floating palace ought to be replaced. Queen Elizabeth, who is commander-in-chief of Britain's armed forces, is understood to feel that a yacht is no longer necessary for the purposes of royal travel alone. It is still possible that a new vessel will combine royal service with more prosaic tasks such as promoting British trade - as Britannia has been doing for the past few years. The government is also keeping its options open on the ultimate fate of Britannia, which has been anchored off the coast of Finland this week and will be used next week for a reception by the London Docklands Development Corporation - a typical assignment. The Queen indicated through a spokesman that she hoped the yacht could continue to serve a useful purpose 'in this country' - a hint that she does not want it to be sold to a wealthy foreigner as the ultimate status symbol. The MoD said the Queen would be consulted closely over the yacht's final destiny but nothing was ruled out. The vessel's running costs - Pounds 9.2m in the past financial year - are only a tiny fraction of the annual defence budget of about Pounds 23bn, but to have kept the yacht in service for another five years beyond 1997 would have required a Pounds 17m refit. The Queen's Flight, a prestigious unit of the RAF which consists of three BAe 146 passenger jets and two Wessex helicopters, is to be amalgamated with another squadron and transferred from its base in Oxfordshire to Northolt in west London.</p>

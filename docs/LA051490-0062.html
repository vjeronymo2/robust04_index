			<p><P> May 14, 1990, Monday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SAN FRANCISCO;  </P> <P> INCINERATORS OKD DESPITE OBJECTIONS  </P> <P> The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has approved permits for two waste  incinerators in the East Bay, despite objections from nearby residents who want  the 1960s-era facilities closed. The permits, which go into effect June 30,  were granted to Chevron Chemical Co., which operates a chemical plant in  Richmond, and Shell Oil Co., which has an oil refinery in Martinez.  </P> <P> Under the permits, tighter controls were imposed that limit burning to wastes  generated on site, according to EPA spokesman Al Zemsky. "We can't say there is  no risk" to nearby residents, Zemsky said. "But the risk involved is minimal."  Henry Clark, spokesman for the West County Toxics Coalition, which wanted the  burning to stop, said residents do not believe incinerators can be safe and  fear their health problems have been caused by the burning operation.  </P></p>

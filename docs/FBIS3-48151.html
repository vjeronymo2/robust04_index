The clash occurred around 7.50 a.m. when the army patrol  from the Civilian-Police-Military Command 43 under Capt Thara  Panyachan launched a surprise attack on a hilltop camp near Ban  Cho Ludi in Tambon Bala.    About five bandits, believed to be led by Suwa Khao of the  BRN, fled the camp after the 20-minute battle.    The government force, on the seventh day of its patrol,  seized five huts and some food.</p>

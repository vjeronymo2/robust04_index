In an interview to the INFOTAG agency he said that the  Democratic Party advocated rescheduling the election date in the  eastern rayons even before an official proposal to this effect  by the chairman of the Central Electoral Commission.    Gheorghe Ghimpu said: "Undoubtedly, the separatist leaders  of  Tiraspol will try to hinder the residents of the eastern rayons  of Moldova who will wish to take part in the elections at  polling stations on the right bank of the Dniester. Problems  with transportation and vote counting and certain difficulties  will certainly appear. Moving up the election date would  facilitate the resolution of these issues."    He noted that the Democratic Party has developed its own  concept for solving the problem of the Dniester region. It  envisions the establishment of a territorial-administrative unit  of republic significance with the seat in Tiraspol. It could  consist of two uyezds--an industrial uyezd, including the  present-day Kamenskiy and Rybnitskiy Rayons, and an agrarian  uyezd, including the present-day Dubossarskiy, Sloboziyskiy, and  Grigoriopolskiy Rayons.</p>

			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / ADB considers its first loan to Cambodia for 21 years THE Asian Development Bank is discussing its first loan to Cambodia for 21 years, marking the country's return to the international financial community after the ravages of the Khmer Rouge regime in the 1970s and the subsequent 13-year civil war. Officials said the bank is considering a special rehabilitation loan of Dollars 50m to Dollars 70m (Pounds 28m to Pounds 39m) for emergency support for transport, irrigation, fertiliser and health care. The financing will go before the ADB board within two months if legal and bureaucratic obstacles can be overcome. Cambodia must still repay a small amount of arrears, and the legal entity receiving the loan must be determined, as the country still has an interim government structure. New loans would also depend on continuation of the UN-sponsored peace process. Yesterday, Khmer Rouge guerrillas launched attacks on government-held positions in the worst violations yet of the ceasefire begun last autumn. The scale of the rebuilding task awaiting Cambodia's new government is revealed in a report by the ADB released at its annual meeting in Hong Kong. Production of most goods, such as rice, rubber and fish, though they recovered in the 1980s under the Vietnamese-installed government, is below 1969 levels. By 1979, after the genocidal reign of the Khmer Rouge in which 1m people died, life expectancy was down to 31. By 1989, it was still only up to 48. Annual per capita income is guessed to be between Dollars 150 and Dollars 200, though even this low figure masks wide disparities between relative prosperity in Phnom Penh, the capital, and poverty elsewhere. What the ADB does not mention is the need for successful UN-monitored elections of a new government, rehabilitation of over 300,000 refugees, and clearing of land-mines. Mr Ou Orhat, vice-minister of planning and head of the Cambodian delegation to the ADB meeting, said yesterday: 'After twenty years of destructive war, the reconstruction needs are enormous.'</p>

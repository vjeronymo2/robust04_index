			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Lloyds Chemists sells Renacare for Pounds 5m LLOYDS CHEMISTS, which in March won control of Macarthy with a Pounds 92.5m bid, has sold one of the acquired subsidiaries for Pounds 5m, writes Jane Fuller. Renacare, a maker of renal dialysis fluids, is being purchased by WR Grace, a North American speciality chemicals company. Lloyds said Renacare, based near Romford, comprised about 40 per cent of the Pounds 9m turnover at Macarthy Laboratories, and less than a quarter of its Pounds 7.6m net assets. Lloyds was mainly interested in the retailing and drugs distribution parts of Macarthy, which means there may be one or two other disposals. Lloyds has bought Millnew, which trades as National Veterinary Supplies, in a deal worth Pounds 1.88m. NVS was formed in 1989 and operates three wholesale depots, supplying veterinary practices throughout the UK.</p>

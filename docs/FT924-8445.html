			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / Further erosion of Maxwell era Murdoch MacLennan, managing director of Associated Newspapers' main printing operation, Harms-worth Quays, is to be the new managing director of the Scottish Daily Record and Sunday Mail. Apart from running the Scottish titles of Mirror Group Newspapers, MacLennan, who is 43, will also be responsible for all MGN's printing operations, and was yesterday appointed to the main board. This appointment heralds the departure of Vic Horwood after 30 years with the Mirror group. Two weeks ago Horwood was replaced as chief executive of MGN by David Montgomery, former editor of Today, but remained chairman of the Scottish Daily Record. His departure further reduces the number of senior Mirror executives surviving from Robert Maxwell era. Last week Alan Stephens resigned from his position as company secretary. In June, Ernest Burrington stepped down as MGN chairman and was replaced by Sir Robert Clark. Speaking of Horwood's devotion to MGN, Sir Robert said: 'His special contribution since Maxwell's death has helped MGN over a traumatic period.' Mirror Group Newspapers also announced the appointment of James McColgan, who recently retired as chief executive of Blue Circle Industries, as a non-executive director.</p>

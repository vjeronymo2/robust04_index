			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Svetlana Ivanova] </F>   [Text] St. Petersburg, 24 Jun -- A delegation of  parliamentarians of the North Atlantic Assembly has arrived in  the city on the Neva. Today they visited the Taurida Palace --  the headquarters of the Inter-Parliamentary Assembly [IPA] of  the CIS countries.    The representatives of the inter-parliamentary organization  of the 16 NATO member-states were interested in the economic  situation in the Commonwealth countries and, first and foremost  in the parliamentary capital of the CIS. During a conversation  with Mikhail Krotov, the general secretary of the IPA, issues  related to the conversion of defense enterprises both in St.  Petersburg and in the CIS as a whole, and problems of attracting  foreign investments to the former Soviet republics were touched  upon. In this connection, Krotov stressed the IPA's special  role in creating the legal basis for the market economy on the  territory of all the Commonwealth countries and in developing  international business contacts.    The sides expressed mutual interest in strengthening further  ties between two of the world's major parliamentary structures.</p>

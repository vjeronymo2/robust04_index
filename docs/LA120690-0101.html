			<p><P> December 6, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: EL MONTE;  </P> <P> BAN ON SCAVENGING DEFEATED  </P> <P> Who has the right to the bottles and cans residents place at the curb for  recycling?  </P> <P> The City Council last week voted down and sent back to the city attorney for  revision an ordinance that would have prohibited trash scavenging.  </P> <P> Councilwoman Patricia Wallach, who earlier backed the measure, spoke against it  last week. She said some people make a living scavenging. But some residents  said the scavengers break bottles and invade their privacy.  </P> <P> The measure, requested by Webster Disposal Co., which contracts with the city  for trash pickup and recycling, would have allowed scavenging only with the  property owner's permission.  </P></p>

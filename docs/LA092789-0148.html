			<p><P> September 27, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ANTLEY ADMITS DRUG PROBLEM, YIELDS LICENSE  </P> <P> Jockey Chris Antley, suspended by Belmont Park stewards, admits that he has a  "substance abuse" problem and has voluntarily surrendered his license, the New  York State Racing and Wagering Board said today.  </P> <P> In a statement released through the board, Antley also said he will not race in  any other state until the board "acts on my application, if any, for  relicensing or reinstatement in New York."  </P> <P> Belmont stewards took Antley off his scheduled mounts last Saturday and  suspended him indefinitely for undisclosed reasons. At the same time, Antley's  agent, Drew Mollica, said he had severed all ties with the jockey.  </P> <P> Antley, 23, has a long history of drug abuse. He failed a Breathalyzer test for  alcohol in 1986 and tested positive for marijuana in 1987. Last November,  Antley tested positive for cocaine and underwent rehabilitation.  </P> <P> The board said that Antley has sought professional help again and that it will  monitor his progress.  </P></p>

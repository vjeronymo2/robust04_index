			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / Election rivals condemn Perot 'investigations' PRESIDENT George Bush and Mr Bill Clinton united yesterday to condemn private investigations of prominent public figures allegedly ordered by Mr Ross Perot, the likely independent presidential candidate. Mr Bush took umbrage at the reports of Mr Perot's investigations, describing them as 'beyond the pale' in a television programme to be shown this week. Mr Clinton, the prospective Democratic candidate, yesterday attacked the alleged investigations into the president and his family. However, Mr Tom Luce, a senior aide to Mr Perot, dismissed as distortions reports that the Texas businessman had ordered the probes. 'There were no investigations, no detectives.' The charges against Mr Perot came 'from the people who have specialised in saying 'we'll do whatever it takes to win',' he said. Vice-President Dan Quayle, who has led the recent Republican assault on Mr Perot's penchant for activities he says show contempt for the law, chipped in by pointing out the danger to civil liberties of a President Perot in charge of the 'IRS, the FBI and CIA'. The particular bone of contention is a Washington Post report on Sunday covering alleged Perot-inspired probes into the business dealings of the president, his family and associates. It highlighted an incident in 1988 when Mr Perot personally turned over to the newspaper documents relating to a Dollars 48m (Pounds 25.9m) Pennzoil lease transaction said to have benefited those close to the then vice-president. Mr Luce said yesterday this was 'a highly questionable transaction,' details of which had been given to Mr Perot and passed on to the newspaper as a matter of public interest. No investigation of Mr Bush has been ordered, he added. However, other reports have also highlighted examples of Mr Perot's alleged proclivity to order background checks on those who might have displeased him. This latest controversy was not apparently a factor in a New York Times poll yesterday, which reported a doubling in Mr Perot's unfavourable rating compared with a previous survey in April. His comments that wealthier US pensioners should give up social security benefits went down with a thud. However, the poll also found Mr Bush and Mr Clinton in worse shape. Approval for the president's handling of the economy was lower even than the depths plumbed by President Jimmy Carter at the same stage in 1980, while the Democrat's capacity for strong leadership was viewed as lower than either Mr Bush or Mr Perot. The net result was that four out of 10 people surveyed expressed dissatisfaction with the three choices before them.</p>

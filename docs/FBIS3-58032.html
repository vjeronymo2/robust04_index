			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Greg McIvor: "Swedish Cabinet Divided on Bridge"] </F>   [Text] Stockholm -- Sweden's rightwing coalition  government was divided last night on whether to go ahead with a  controversial proposed bridge link with Denmark.    An eagerly-awaited announcement on the future of the 1.8  billion pound state-backed scheme was unexpectedly postponed  because of a split that could destroy the four-party coalition.    The Centre Party, which opposes the project on environmental  grounds, has repeatedly threatened to withdraw from the  coalition and bring down the government unless the plans are  shelved.    As several hundred antibridge demonstrators gathered outside  the Swedish cabinet offices in Stockholm, Olof Johansson, the  leader of the Centre Party and environment minister, held firm  to his demand that the project should be dropped.    Forced uncharacteristically on to the defensive, the prime  minister, Carl Bildt, denied that the government was in crisis  and rejected allegations that he was ready to horse-trade.    Mr. Bildt said ministers needed more time to study the  implications of the "very controversial" bridge. A decision is  not expected for another week.    Mr. Bildt acknowledged the Centre Party's opposition to the  plans but said Sweden intended to respect an agreement signed  with Denmark in 1991 to build a combined bridge and tunnel link  across the Oresund Strait between Malmo and Copenhagen.    "It is a principle of this government to respect the  agreement with Denmark and carry out a tough environmental  assessment," Mr. Bildt said.    Mr. Bildt said the cabinet's views on the project and those  of Mr. Johansson did not vary widely.    "We are close to each other when it comes to the question of  the Oresund bridge," he said.    But the prime minister admitted there was "certain tension."  He said the cabinet still needed to collect more material on  public transport and air and water pollution.    Should the Centre Party choose to leave the government, the  coalition would be dissolved and the speaker would appoint a  prime minister, probably Mr. Bildt, to set up a new government.    Bertil Fiskesjo, a Centre Party member, said the party would  stay in the government as long as certain conditions are met.    "Our chances of influencing the continued assessment and  development of the bridge would decrease if we left," he said.    Rigorous environmental evaluations have indicated that it  will be difficult, if not impossible, to build the bridge  without disturbing the environment in the strait.    The Centre Party, which has strong agrarian roots, believes  any bridge will damage the environment above and below ground  and impede salt water currents from the North Sea which  replenish the Baltic's brackish waters.    The salt-water flows are vital to the health of marine life  in the Baltic. A panel of international marine experts hired  recently by the Swedish government to investigate the plan's  implications could give no guarantee that a bridge would not  block the currents.    "It is impossible to give guarantees for a zero solution (no  environmental impact) on the water flow," a scientist on the  committee told a Danish newspaper yesterday.    Bridge opponents also assert that it will increase traffic  emissions and make nonsense of Sweden and Denmark's commitment  at the Earth Summit in Brazil in 1991 to stabilise carbon  dioxide emissions at 1990 levels by the year 2000.    Ecologists believe the construction of a bridge across the  Oresund Strait will damage the marine environment in an area  well-known for its seabirds, seals and fish.    But Claus Nowotny, of Swedab, the parent company behind the  bridge consortium, said the plan was being used as an  environmental whipping post.    "It has become a kind of symbol for a concrete, car-oriented  and large-scale society," he said.    The combined bridge and tunnel connecting Copenhagen and  Malmo would be the first physical link between Sweden and  Denmark and is seen by both countries as an important emblem of  their determination to boost trade in the Scandinavian and  Baltic region.    Backers of the project say it would cut transport costs and  help tie Sweden more firmly to the European continent. After  two centuries of remaining on the side lines in Europe, Sweden  has applied to join the European Union.    If Sweden pulls out, Denmark has threatened to take legal  action. The continual wrangling over the project has strained  diplomatic relations.    Construction is scheduled to begin this autumn and work to  be  completed by mid-1999. On the Danish side, more than 200 houses  have already been demolished to make way for entry roads.    The Danish government has already spent 100 million pounds  on  a motorway connection between Copenhagen and the site of the  bridge.</p>

			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / UK Company News: Cost control behind Etam's 40% advance to Pounds 11.8m TIGHT CONTROL on costs helped Etam, the fashion retailer in which Oceana Investment Corporation of South Africa has a 34 per cent stake, to increase pre-tax profits by 40 per cent in the 53 weeks to February 1. The improvement, from Pounds 8.45m to Pounds 11.8m, followed a rise in turnover of only 3 per cent to Pounds 213m (Pounds 207m) as the number of shops was reduced to 240 (251). Most closures came in the Peter Brown menswear chain where losses were reduced. Etam is dominated by the eponymous women's fashion stores and also includes the SNOB and Tammy shops. Mr Keith Miles, finance director, said the group's cost-cutting action, which had included a wage freeze and a further cut in stock, had paid off. It had avoided the excesses of high street discounting before Christmas. The outlook for costs had also improved because the 'juggernaut effect' of the huge rent rises imposed in the late 1980s was abating, as was general inflation. Relief on business rates would save the group Pounds 500,000 this year. He said the group was avoiding becoming too specialised. It had extended its appeal to women over 25, who now comprised more than half its customers, and had also moved a little up-market, although it remained at the cheaper end of the fashion spectrum. He was cautious about current trading. Sales were marginally ahead on a like-for-like basis, the bottom line was better, but the progress was a little behind budget. Earnings grew to 11.2p (7.51p). A final dividend of 5.1p (4.65p) makes 6.6p (5.85p). An extraordinary charge of Pounds 1.17m was made to cover the defence against a Pounds 121m hostile bid from Oceana. COMMENT Etam's share price has almost quadrupled since Oceana Investment started buying shares in mid-1990 and yes-terday's closing price of 239p is 54p ahead of the offer, which failed last August. With this year's pre-tax profit forecast to grow to Pounds 14m, the prospective earnings multiple is nearly 18. While Etam deserves its small premium to the stores sector because of its cost control and Pounds 5m in the bank, the attention of recovery seekers may soon swing to other parts of the market. It is also opera-ting in a highly competitive field, where every chain seems out to woo the suddenly fashion-conscious mature woman. And one or two previously wounded players, such as Next, are making a comeback. While Etam is a quality stock, the bid premium may wear thin and the price looks quite high enough.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Agency also proposes to amend 7 CFR part 1945, subpart D, &sect;1945.169 to add a provision regarding nonessential assets in EM loan situations. In many cases, EM loan applicants are not typical FmHA loan applicants in that they may have significant nonfarm asset holdings. Prior to April 30, 1992, FmHA had required EM loan applicants to liquidate nonessential assets prior to loan closing if possible, on the theory that the applicant's equity in these assets should be used to reduce Government subsidized credit needs. This policy proved to impose hardship on farmers already suffering from the affects of a disaster, with minimal results. In many cases, the assets in question could not be sold for the estimated value, and thus no equity was realized. In other cases, the assets were not readily liquidated, and loan recipients were forced to accept much less than true value, or unable to liquidate the assets at any price within the necessary timeframe. As a result of these difficulties, FmHA modified this policy and amended the regulations to require a lien on, rather than a sale of, such assets. A lien on all nonessential assets (with no 150% limit) assures the Agency that the equity will be applied to reducing the farmer's Federally subsidized credit when nonessential assets are sold. On this basis, the requirement for a lien on all nonessential assets in the case of EM loans is continued even though the requirement for a lien on all farm assets is substantially modified.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, the Agency has amended 7 CFR part 1951, subpart S, &sect;1951.910. The requirement that liens will be taken on all assets when loans are restructured will be continued to protect against potential loan losses as a result of extended repayment terms. The Agency proposes to continue this action since a significant amount of debt has been written off over the years, the Agency continues to have a large number of financially stressed high-risk borrowers, and to comply with the GAO report discussed previously in this rule. This section had previously referred to the loan making regulations to prescribe the security requirements for loan restructuring. Since the requirements for loan making will now be different from loan servicing, it is necessary to insert the guidelines into the debt restructuring regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 7 CFR part 1941  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Crops, Livestock, Loan programs_Agriculture, Rural areas, Youth.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 7 CFR part 1943  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Credit, Loan programs_Agriculture, Recreation, Water resources.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 7 CFR part 1945  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Agriculture, Disaster assistance, Loan programs_Agriculture.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

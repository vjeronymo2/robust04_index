			<p><P> February 10, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE;  </P> <P> BOY USES DRUG CASH FOR SPREE  </P> <P> A 14-year-old Berkeley boy took $120,000 in drug money and treated himself and  friends to a three-day spending spree that ended with a trip to Hawaii,  authorities said. The three teen-agers' life of leisure ended when Kauai  police, alerted to their flight, picked them up on a beach Jan. 10 and  recovered $111,000, police and school officials said. According to Oakland  Municipal Court records, one of the boys said he found the money and two bags  of what he said was cocaine in a false-bottom drawer at a relative's home. The  14-year-old left the drugs but took the money, he told police. The teen-ager  and some schoolmates rented a limousine to go to San Francisco, where they  persuaded the driver to rent a room at the Mark Hopkins Hotel, the Oakland  Tribune reported. After their San Francisco fling, some of the students  returned home, and several recounted their adventure to school officials.  </P></p>

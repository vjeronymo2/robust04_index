			<p><P> June 25, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEALS: MARKET WATCH;  </P> <P> THE FISCHBACH CURSE CLAIMS ANOTHER VICTIM  </P> <P> If there ever was a company with a curse on it, it has to be Fischbach Corp.,  the New York-based electrical contracting company. Not only has Fischbach  itself been devastated by the takeover shenanigans of the 1980s, but so have  the key players involved in the 1985 takeover of the company by Victor Posner,  corporate carnivore and convicted felon.  </P> <P> And now, yet another victim seems to be spattered by the mud that seems to  besmirch everyone who comes near Fischbach: American International Group, and  its chairman, Maurice (Hank) Greenberg. AIG, a huge, successful insurance  holding company, is buying Fischbach for $11 a share. Greenberg is one of the  most respected and astute executives in the insurance industry.  </P> <P> The AIG takeover of Fischbach is a very unusual transaction, to say the least.  AIG is buying Fischbach for $44 million, stuffing some of Fischbach's  operations and Fischbach's new business into a company to be managed and 51%  owned by Peter Kiewit Sons Inc. of Omaha and keeping some existing Fischbach  business and other assets. If you have trouble grasping this, join the club.  You don't see $44-million deals this complicated every day. Thank God.  </P> <P> Let me stress that Greenberg's Fischbach problem isn't remotely comparable to  those of the other people who have been tarred by Fischbach: Ivan F. Boesky,  Michael Milken, Drexel Burnham Lambert and Posner.  </P> <P> These players have big, big legal problems; all but Posner copped guilty pleas  to securities fraud involving Fischbach. Posner, who pleaded guilty to criminal  tax fraud in an unrelated case, faces possible indictment. Plus, as you may  recall, all these players lost money in the Fischbach follies.  </P> <P> AIG and Greenberg don't have any legal problem that I can see. But I think that  a company with AIG's reputation ought to disclose certain facts, unpleasant as  they may be, and ought to engage in open dealing with Fischbach's shareholders.  Not to mention AIG's.  </P> <P> I couldn't get Greenberg to talk to me. AIG -- in the form of John Wooster Jr.,  vice president of communications -- says it doesn't see any problem.  </P> <P> Let me tell you what's going on, and you can draw your own conclusion.  </P> <P> AIG says it's buying Fischbach to protect itself against losses in the $500  million of construction surety bonding that it has outstanding to Fischbach.  This bonding guarantees Fischbach's customers that money will be available to  finish a job if Fischbach can't or doesn't complete it. No bonding, no new  business.  </P> <P> After Posner took over Fischbach in 1985, its bonding company, a subsidiary of  Chubb, resigned the account. It didn't want to do business with a company  controlled by Posner, who has a well-deserved reputation for taking excessive  salaries and for putting his personal interests ahead of the interest of his  companies' employees, customers, vendors and stockholders.  </P> <P> Many, if not most, of the major bonding companies also refused to do business  with Posner-controlled Fischbach.  </P> <P> AIG took over the business in 1986. Guess what. It's having so much trouble  getting paid that it had to take out second mortgages on Fischbach properties  to ensure payment of more than $20 million of past-due premiums, ad to lend  Fischbach money to keep it afloat -- and now has to go through a complicated  and expensive takeover of its client to protect itself against losses on the  policies that the client took out.  </P> <P> And Fischbach, it turns out, isn't just any piece of insurance business. It was  business brought to AIG by Mel Harris, an insurance broker at Alexander &amp;  Alexander in Miami.  </P> <P> Harris, a big producer at A&amp;A, is related to Greenberg's wife -- they're  cousins -- and socializes with Greenberg.  </P> <P> Harris says that, despite his relationship with the Greenbergs, none of his  business -- including the Fischbach business -- got any special treatment from  AIG's underwriters. "Being a cousin of Mrs. Greenberg is not of any value when  you are dealing with the surety department of AIG," Harris said wryly.  </P> <P> Harris' statement notwithstanding, the Harris-Greenberg relationship strikes me  as a piece of information that I would like to have if I owned stock in either  Fischbach or AIG. To me, it looks bad not to have disclosed this relationship,  because it looks like AIG is hiding something. I also would be curious whether  AIG has gotten Alexander &amp; Alexander to bear part of AIG's effort and  expense in tending to the Fischbach account.  </P> <P> AIG's answer: There is no legal requirement to disclose any of this. And AIG PR  man Wooster asserts that the Fischbach business was treated by AIG the way  similar business is treated.  </P> <P> I'm sure.  </P> <P> When I asked Wooster how many other times AIG has had to spend more than $40  million to buy a customer to protect itself against insurance losses, he said  that question was outside the Fischbach transaction, and he wouldn't answer it.  </P> <P> Once upon a time, Fischbach was a proud, productive and profitable company that  helped build electric generating plants, trash-to-energy plants and other  facilities that society needs. Thanks to the fancy and illegal dancing that  went on, the company and the people who helped Posner buy it were destroyed.  </P> <P> After this deal goes through, there probably will be plenty of Fischbach  employees' blood on the streets as Kiewit slashes the work force. When that's  over, though, there is a reasonable chance that Fischbach, in its Kiewit-AIG  incarnation, will be proud, productive and profitable again.  </P> <P> It's a pity, though, that a once-fine company that has been under a cloud for  so many years is losing its independence under a cloud. But, given the  Fischbach Curse, it was probably to be expected.  </P></p>

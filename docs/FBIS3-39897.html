It said that if North Korea does not meet the deadline, IAEA  director general Hans Blix will call for another meeting of the  agency's Council of Governors to press the UN Security Council  to impose sanctions on Pyongyang.    The sources added that the IAEA would abstain from calling  the deadline an ultimatum so as not to impede on ongoing  negotiations between the U.S. and North Korea.    "A large number of board members... asked the director  general immediately to convene a board meeting in the absence of  satisfactory developments in connection with the inspection,"  said board chairman Ronald Walker.    The members had asked that the meeting be called "notably if  a firm, early date for the start of the inspection had not been  settled by the end of this month," he added.    Western diplomatic sources said China in particular had been  opposed to setting a specific deadline.    Earlier Wednesday, the IAEA Council of Governors meeting  here  was told by the Pyongyang delegation that North Korea has  informed the United States it would be ready to allow inspection  of its nuclear sites as of March 1, but on four conditions.    The main condition is a public announcement of the  cancellation of the annual joint U.S.-South Korean manoeuvres  code-named "Team Spirit," Ho Jin Yun, the advisor to the North  Korean Embassy in Vienna, announced.    He did not specify what the other conditions were, but  implied that they were still under discussion in New York.    A Western diplomatic source said Pyongyang's proposal  "changed nothing" with regard to the IAEA's talks here.    The IAEA and North Korea agreed last week on ways of opening  up seven nuclear sites to inspection under the framework of the  Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).    Ho accused Blix Wednesday of orchestrating a "political  plot"  aimed at casting fresh doubt on Pyongyang's nuclear activities.    In a speech to the Council he denounced the IAEA's demand to  carry out special inspections as "tantamount to an attempt to  drive the Democratic People's Republic of Korea out of the NPT."    The IAEA is pressing to carry out inspection of two sites at  Yongbyon, where it suspects Pyongyang is stockpiling liquid and  solid nuclear waste which could come from a military nuclear  programme.    In his opening report on Monday, Blix stressed that unless  the IAEA were allowed to visit other sites and have access to  extra information, it would not be able to verify whether  Pyongyang's initial declaration on its nuclear programme was  full and accurate.    Walker said after Wednesday's meeting that the board  "expressed its continuing deep concern at the seriousness of the  situation and its support for a negotiated, peaceful solution of  the nuclear and other security issues of the Korean peninsula."</p>

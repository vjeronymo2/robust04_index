			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Japanese equities It may be wrong to pin the blame for yesterday's fall in the Tokyo market on the 5 per cent fall in Japan Telecom's share price. But the issue's high-profile flop has certainly put the Japanese system for pricing equity offerings under the spotlight. Japan Telecom was designed to appeal to foreigners. There is a danger that it will instead reinforce investor suspicions that buying new Japanese equity is a quick way to lose money. Japan's system for pricing issues was introduced following the Recruit share scandal of the late 1980s. Then the problem was that new issues typically shot to handsome premiums and so companies could reward their friends by allocating them shares. But in combating corruption, the current system has brought its own problems. The main difference between the Japanese system and the 'bookbuilding' process used in most international equity issues is that the price is set through an auction near the start of the offering period rather than near the end. The delay between pricing an issue and trading means the share price is a hostage to wider market movements. Investors also have less time to analyse a stock before placing their bids. Japan Telecom is due to be followed by several other large issues. Japan Tobacco is next in line and two railway companies, JR West and JR Central, are expected next year. It is too late to alter the system for the Tobacco sale. But if future flotations are to attract foreign investors, Tokyo will need to bring its issuing practices closer to international standards.</p>

			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / Tecs chief ready for trouble: The councils' champion sees them in a broader role Mr Michael Bett, the non-executive chairman of the new national council representing the 82 training and enterprise councils in England and Wales, says he is accustomed to being at the centre of a storm. The former deputy chairman of British Telecommunications takes the helm of the council in the wake of reports criticising the running of Tecs, the employer-led bodies responsible for administering government-funded training programmes and fostering local economic development. Mr Bett, who remains chairman of BT subsidiary Cellnet, says business executives on the boards of Tecs have made a 'very brave effort' and should receive greater public recognition. 'Tecs are not quangos,' says Mr Bett. 'These non-executive directors are not paid. They are trying to do their best in something which is absolutely new. At the same time they are all running their own businesses.' However, he appears determined to act on criticisms when they appear justified. The national council is the successor body to G10 - a small group of Tec chairmen who represented Tecs nationally, particularly to the government. Mr Bett says that, as a former personnel director at the BBC and at GEC, he was in the centre of various storms. 'I hope I have learned how to deal with them,' he says. But he says he cannot yet say how he will handle relationships between Tecs and the government. He will spend two days a week on his new post, and has recruited a new policy and strategy director 'who I will rely on to make sure that I learn, and learn quickly'. A member of the government working group on social security reform, he is already concerned with the situation of unemployed young people. He believes his experience at BT, where he was involved in the privatisation process, could prove valuable for Tecs, which employ former civil servants alongside people from the private sector. 'They are not oil and water,' says Mr Bett. A greater challenge for Tecs was one similar to that at BT when it started substantial recruiting: to get all employees speaking the same corporate language. 'It was like a Tower of Babel at BT with people having been trained to approach their jobs in many different ways. But we spent time developing a common language.' He is confident that Tecs can blend the talents and attitudes of their workforces into teams capable of improving industrial competitiveness. 'Tecs are here to stay, although that does not mean they will not evolve from concentrating on the unemployed into stimulators of enterprise.' People, Page 14</p>

			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / International Company News: Fletcher Challenge floats farm business FLETCHER Challenge, the New Zealand energy and forestry concern, is to publicly float the oldest part of its business, Wrightson, the farm supply company founded in 1860. Fletcher Challenge was formed from the merger in 1980 of Challenge Corporation, whose main asset was Wrightson, and the building company Fletcher Holdings. Yesterday's announcement surprised New Zealand investors, as the farm servicing sector was always seen as a traditional and fundamental part of the business. Fletcher Challenge's chief executive, Mr Hugh Fletcher, said Wrightson was an important part of the company's history. However, with its international growth, the parent now used only a small proportion of the company's funds. Its establishment as a separate entity would leave Wrightson to focus on the rural sector. Wrightson operates in such areas as woolbroking and rural real estate sales. Revenue for 1992-93 was more than NZDollars 620m (USDollars 344.4m), excluding commission sales of NZDollars 1.65bn. Mr Fletcher said the sale was not driven by Fletcher Challenge's balance sheet reduction programme, although the proceeds would be used to retire debt. The Wrightson shares will not be made available to shareholders living in the US and Canada because of regulatory matters. Mr Fletcher said that following the sale, Fletcher Challenge would concentrate on its three core businesses: energy, forestry and construction. The float will be through a pro rata entitlement to existing shareholders. They will be offered the chance to subscribe for Wrightson shares at NZDollars 100 for every 800 Fletcher Challenge shares held. Fletcher Challenge also confirmed yesterday it would proceed with a flotation of its New Zealand retail outlets.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Baku (April 5) TURAN--The Russian oil company Lukoil  intends to develop the Caspian offshore oil-field "Kyapaz".    State Oil Company of Azerbaijan [SOCAR] told Turan that  Lukoil intends to develop this oil-field either in the framework  of the consortium of western oil companies or independently.    In exchange of that the Russian company is ready to give up  its share in the consortium or to refuse its participation in  the development of "Azeri" and "Chirag" oil-fields together with  western companies.    In March 1994 Lukoil and SOCAR signed the agreement. Under  the agreement, the Russian company has to get the share of 10  per cent from the participation in the consortium of western oil  companies. Lukoil has to get one third of Azeri oil explored  from two oil-fields. That time, official Baku did not conceal  that this agreement signed with Russian oil company is of  political character. "Kyapaz" offshore oil-field located  135-140 km to the coast, close to Guneshli oil-field. Its  reserves total 25 million tons of oil. Local geologists drilled  three wells on "Kyapaz". Two of them are gas-bearing and one is  oil-bearing one. According to SOCAR's specialists, geological  researches presently conducted are not sufficient to estimate  reserves of this oil-field exactly.</p>

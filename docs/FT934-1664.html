			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / Pooling funds to ease the pain of change: Negotiations among Europe's petrochemicals producers to cut loss-making capacity Europe's petrochemicals industry is in agony. Profitability has fallen for five years and not a single producer is covering reinvestment costs. Today the sector's most important manufacturers will tackle the cause of the suffering. Delegates from Europe's most important manufacturers of ethylene, the basic building block of plastics, are gathering in Brussels under the auspices of the Association of Petrochemicals Producers in Europe to discuss closing capacity. The 10-strong subcommittee is expected to make a final decision about whether to recommend a Europe-wide rationalisation programme. The problem facing the sector is deceptively simple. There are 53 ethylene crackers in western Europe with capacity of 18.4m tonnes a year. Next year the figure will rise to 19.34m tonnes because of BASF's new 650,000-tonne-a-year plant in Antwerp. In contrast, demand, hit by the European recession, is expected to be only 15.6m tonnes next year, according to Trichem consultants, the London-based industry specialists. Given the massive imbalance between supply and demand, prices of ethylene derivatives remain grim and capacity utilisation rates during the fourth quarter have drifted below 80 per cent. Polystyrene prices have tumbled from more than DM2.60 (Pounds 1.03) a kilo in 1989 to less than DM1.50 while polypropylene prices have plummeted from DM2.30 a kilo in 1990 to just over DM1. Efforts by manufacturers to raise prices this autumn have been largely unsuccessful. Increases were almost immediately undermined by discounting. The only exception was PVC, which has gone up 20 per cent since September, but from a devastatingly low base. The solution appears obvious. The industry must cut capacity. The proposal being discussed today is that between 1.5m tonnes and 2m tonnes a year of ethylene capacity should be shut down. This would be achieved by setting up a DM500m fund based on a levy of about DM30 per tonne of installed capacity. Those manufacturers wanting to close capacity would then bid for part of the fund in return for shutting down their plants. Some derivative production would also need to be closed. According to estimates by brokers James Capel, Enichem of Italy would pay DM63m into the scheme for its capacity of 2.1m tonnes a year; Shell DM51m for its 1.7m tonnes; Dow DM48m for its 1.6m tonnes; BASF and Elf Atochem DM45m each for their 1.5m tonnes; the Fina-Neste joint-venture DM30m for its 1m tonnes; DSM DM30m for its 1m tonnes; and Imperial Chemical Industries DM18m for its 600,000 tonnes. Mr Jukka Viinanen, APPE president, is optimistic about the plan's prospects. But the barriers to rationalisation remain considerable. These include environmental clean-up and redundancy costs, as well as the political obstacles to closing state-owned plants. Last month members of the APPE general council members voted 20 to three in favour of the plan, with two abstentions. But if the plan is to work, unanimity is needed. Ethylene producers have remained unwilling to discuss prospects for the meeting. The sticking points appear to be: Whether the capacity closures would be sufficient to justify the fund's creation. Whether producers, which closed capacity in the 1980s at their own expense and are now cost-efficient, should pay for others to close plants. ICI, for example, closed 650,000 tonnes of capacity during the 1980s. Whether a moratorium on new capacity could be agreed. There would be little point in closing capacity if other manufacturers added new production soon afterwards. The APPE is determined that a decision on whether or not to press ahead with the plan should be made today. Delaying it further could be counter-productive, preventing rationalisation that would take place anyway. Mergers of individual businesses - such as between Shell and Himont, Enichem and BP Chemicals, and Neste and Statoil - appear to be in limbo. Even if the steering committee does give the green light to the plan, it has to be approved by the members' boards and by the European Commission. Earlier this month Mr Karel Van Miert, European competition commissioner, said he needed to be convinced the situation facing the industry was not merely a dip in the business cycle, but rather a true structural crisis with no hope of a reasonable recovery without rationalisation. He also warned that any restructuring should not be used to create an anti-competitive cartel. If that was the case, the Commission would not hesitate to take appropriate action, he said. If the proposals go ahead, the question remains whether they will have any real impact. Over the past decade, Europe, with its high labour, energy, environmental and logistical costs, has become a net importer of plastics. Attempts at price rises may inevitably be undermined by greater imports from low-cost manufacturers in the US and Middle East. In other words, the present unprofitability may be the consequence of structural change in the sector, rather than its traditional cyclicality. If so, the petrochemicals manufacturers' efforts to close capacity and swap or merge businesses may prove of little use. As Ms Hilfra Tandy, editor of Chemical Matters, the industry newsletter, has warned: the plastics producers' increasingly frantic efforts to save themselves could prove little more effective than passengers swapping deckchairs on the decks of the Titanic.</p>

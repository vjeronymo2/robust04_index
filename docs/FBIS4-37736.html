			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by 'Abd-al-Jabbar al-Barghuthi] </F>   [Text] Tunis -- Palestinian leader Yasir 'Arafat has  condemned the Israeli policy, based on procrastination and  foot-dragging, concerning the prisoners and their right to  breath the air of freedom and live among their families and near  their children, who have been waiting for them impatiently. He  called on Rabin's government to honor its obligations by  completing the release of prisoners in Israeli jails, without  discrimination or vacillation, and granting them the right to  live with honor and dignity in any place they wish without being  forced to go to this or that area inside the one homeland.    'Arafat affirmed his clear response to the Israeli notion  which is trying to put controversial issues on hold under the  pretext of "the final stage solution." He considered Jerusalem  to be an urgent issue whose final status should be discussed as  soon as possible, as stipulated by the Oslo accord despite its  bias.    'Arafat said: Our position on the issue of settlements must  be one of isolation. We should not create any opportunity for  coexistence with the settlements or accept them. They  contravene international resolutions and laws and were built,  from the start, on a false basis.    'Arafat said: It was not appropriate to refer to the  settlements in the economic agreement despite the fact that the  Israeli authorities receive 100 percent of the taxes deducted  from Palestinian workers in these settlements. We do not want  the settlements to remain and do not encourage work in them  under any inducement.    'Arafat assured the Palestinian people that the  establishment  of an independent Palestinian state, with holy Jerusalem as its  capital, was inevitable regardless of the statements or the  climate propagated by Israeli extremists.    'Arafat affirmed that the aspired for state, for which our  people have always dreamed and struggled with their most  precious possessions, will belong to all Palestinians wherever  they may reside. In this state, they can develop their national  and cultural identity and enjoy full and equal rights. Their  religious and political beliefs and human dignity will be upheld  within framework of a democratic parliamentary system based on  freedom of opinion, freedom to establish parties, protection of  the minority's rights by the majority, and the minority's  respect for the majority's decisions.    'Arafat added that this system will also be based on social  justice, equality, and no discrimination toward universal rights  on the basis of race, religion, color, or between male and  female. This, within framework of a constitution that ensures  the sovereignty of law and an independent judiciary and on the  basis of effective loyalty to the Palestinian spiritual and  cultural heritage of tolerance and smooth coexistence among  religions throughout centuries.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 24 Jun (PL) -- Members of the diplomatic  corps accredited in Cuba today had an overall view of a major  military education facility when they visited Granma Naval  Academy in response to an official invitation.    Diplomatic delegation heads, military attaches, and other  officials of the diplomatic corps accredited in the country were  accompanied by Deputy Foreign Relations Minister Nicolas  Rodriguez, who has firsthand knowledge of the school which  trains officers for Cuba's Navy, merchant marine, and fishing  boats.    Following their welcome in the form of a brief military  parade, the diplomats took a two and one-half hour tour to  observe the details of projects required of the hundreds of  specialists who graduate from the academy. The projects are  related to the country's defense and other activities linked to  national economic development    The academy, located in Bauta Municipality, Havana Province,  educates military science graduates; experts on mines,  torpedoes, complex artillery missile systems, radio  communications, and power installations; navigation officers;  and naval science graduates.    Hundreds of youths are tested annually before registration  at  the academy, which graduated 200 students during the last school  year and which organizes the country's maritime manning tables,  among other duties.    In keeping with the Cuban Foreign Ministry's policy of  promoting contact between accredited diplomats and the many  domestic sectors, the foreign officials visited classrooms,  talked with recruits and officers, and had access to modern  weapons displays.    The domestic and foreign reporters accompanying the  diplomats  also witnessed peculiar events, such as the curiosity exhibited  by Joseph Gerard Sullivan, chief of the U.S. Interests section  in Cuba, about sophisticated equipment used to camouflage  submarine units.    At the end of the tour, the visitors were able to closely  observe the NIG 14 antisubmarine helicopter and the installation  of a powerful land-sea rocket launcher, which, in addition to  being part of the academy students' curriculum, are defense  instruments used by the Cuban naval forces.</p>

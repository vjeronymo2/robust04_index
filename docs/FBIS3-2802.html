			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Hong Kong, March 11 (AFP) -- One of Hong Kong's  most influentual bankers called Friday for an end to the local  dollar's peg to the U.S. greenback, saying it was a major cause  of chronic inflation in the territory. Bank of East Asia Ltd.  Chairman David Li said the 10-year-old peg should be replaced --  after consultations with China, which takes back Hong Kong in  1997 -- with a trade-weighted basket of currencies. "Singapore  does it. Taiwan does it. Even China does it," he said.    Inflation eased slightly to 8.5 percent for working-class  households in 1993, and Financial Secretary Sir Hamish Macleod  has forecast a similar level for this year. But the British  administration has its hands tied because the dollar peg  surrenders monetary policy to the U.S. Federal Reserve, which is  preoccupied with kick-starting the U.S. economy out of recession.    The Hong Kong dollar was pegged at 7.80 per U.S. dollar in  October 1983, when Sino-British talks on returning the colony to  China in 1997 triggered a crisis of confidence and a flight of  capital. With Hong Kong now an economic dynamo, the local  dollar has consistently been on the strong side, but the Hong  Kong government has repeatedly argued that the peg must stay to  guarantee financial stability. Li, who also represents the  banking industry in the Legislative Council, disagreed strongly  with that view, saying: "Some of our very high power people  have their heads in the sand."    In a speech to the conference organized by the FAR EASTERN  ECONOMIC REVIEW magazine, Li said inflation was fast robbing  Hong Kong of its competitive edge against Malaysia, Singapore,  South Korea and Taiwan. "Inflation is the single greatest  threat to our competitiveness," he said. "It is simply too  high. Day after day, month by month, we are pricing ourselves  out of the market."</p>

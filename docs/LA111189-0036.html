			<p><P> November 11, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOLF ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> LITTLER SHOOTS 66 FOR LAS VEGAS LEAD  </P> <P> Gene Littler, returning to the site of three of his 29 PGA Tour victories, shot  a six-under par 66 Friday for a one-stroke lead after the first round of the  Senior PGA Tour's Las Vegas tournament.  </P> <P> Littler, who won the Tournament of Champions three successive years beginning  in 1955 at the Desert Inn Country Club, used seven birdies to pull ahead of  Charles Coody and Senior Tour rookie George Archer.  </P> <P> Another shot back at 69 were Lee Elder and course record-holder Al Geiberger.  Chi Chi Rodriguez, Orville Moody, John Paul Cain, Tom Shaw, Ben Smith and Lou  Graham were next at two-under 70.  </P> <P> Despite what he called "pretty pathetic ball striking," Robert Wrenn moved into  the lead after three rounds of the Kapalua International golf tournament in  Hawaii.  </P> <P> The 30-year-old Wrenn fired a five-under-par 67, including an eagle, five  birdies and two bogies.  </P> <P> His three-day total of 14-under-par 202 was good for a one-shot lead over Steve  Pate entering today's final round. Pate shot a 68.  </P></p>

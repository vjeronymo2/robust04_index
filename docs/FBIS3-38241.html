			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Vienna, Jan 21 (CTK) -- Czech Minister of Industry  and Trade Vladimir Dlouhy said on Thursday [20 January] that  Austria had stopped anti-dumping proceedings against the Czech  Republic, regarding Czech exports of cement, tractors, and other  farm machinery to Austria, since it had been proved that  accusations of dumping had no factual basis.    Speaking to CTK at the close of his one-day talks in Vienna,  Dlouhy said that only the problem concerning imports of  industrial fertilizers from the Czech Republic remains to be  solved.    In his talks with Austrian Minister of Environment Maria  Rauch-Kallat concerning the Czech nuclear power plants at  Temelin, south Bohemia, and Dukovany, south Moravia, Dlouhy said  that Temelin would be completed. He refuted the opinion voiced  at times in Austria that Temelin was a Russian project. He  pointed out that Temelin would have safety standards  corresponding to those of Germany, Switzerland, France, and  other advanced countries.    During his talks with Economic Affairs Minister Wolfgang  Schussel, Dlouhy expressed interest in talks on Austria's  integration into the European Union (EU). Dlouhy said these  talks might be instructive for the Czech Republic as all  Austrian representatives were convinced of the positive effect  of the integration on Austria's economy.</p>

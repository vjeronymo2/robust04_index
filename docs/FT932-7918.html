			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / Exchange warns companies on leaks COMPANIES listed on the London Stock Exchange should make public statements rather than leaking price-sensitive information, Mr Martin Hall, the exchange's head of public policy, said yesterday, Peter Martin writes. On Friday the exchange censured London International Group for leaking news about lower-than-expected profits to a limited number of analysts and investors. In a speech in Edinburgh, Mr Hall said the market did not like disagreeable shocks, and the best way of avoiding them was the immediate publication of price-sensitive material. 'Currently there is reluctance to make such formal statements, bred of fear that the market will over-react because they are relatively rare events,' he said. 'If they were more commonly used they would be received by the market with a better sense of proportion.' There could also be useful regular dialogue between companies and the market. 'But such dialogue should not be the means of imparting selectively what all the world should be told,' he said.</p>

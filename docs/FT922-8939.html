			<p>920511 FT  11 MAY 92 / Middle East: Weapons deals hit prospects for Mideast stability HOPES for a more stable Middle East after Iraq's defeat in the Gulf war are buckling under the sheer weight of some Dollars 30bn (Pounds 16.7bn) in proposed new arms transfers - with the US among the main culprits in speeding deliveries to the region. President George Bush's much-vaunted arms control initiative of May 1991 - in which he urged the world's five leading powers to limit arms sales to the Middle East - appears to be running into the sand. According to the US Arms Control Association, Washington has proposed Dollars 6bn in weapons transfers since the initiative was announced, and Dollars 19bn worth of arms in total since the end of the Gulf war itself, with Saudi Arabia alone ordering Dollars 15bn worth of new equipment. Iran and Syria are also in the vanguard of arms purchases. Both are taking advantage of bargain prices available for surplus equipment from the former Soviet Union and its east European satellites. Military analysts say that in part the arms build-up follows an uninterrupted trend in the Middle East, where superpower and regional rivalries have historically made the region one of the world's main arms markets. But they believe it also reflects strategic uncertainties since the Gulf war. 'There's nothing like an inconclusive war to stimulate arms sales,' says Mr Nicholas Protonotarius of the International Institute of Strategic Studies in London. 'And this was an inconclusive war.' Since the war, every country in the region has been left with its own reasons to buy arms - either for defence or to secure its regional ambitions. The Gulf states are arming defensively to ensure they are never again as vulnerable to invasion; Iran is re-arming from a low base after its destructive war with Iraq, but also with an eye on spreading its influence regionally; Syria is seeking by its missile acquisitions to bridge the vast gap in its capabilities vis-a-vis Israel, which has itself always placed a high priority in maintaining military superiority over its neighbours. Turkey, also with its eyes on a strategic role in the region, is meanwhile developing its own arms manufacturing industry. While the Stockholm-based International Peace Research Institute (Sipri) noted recently that there had been been a significant fall in the value of transfers to the Middle East, from Dollars 14bn in 1987 (the last full year of the Iran-Iraq war) to Dollars 5bn in 1991, these figures ignore the real tension caused by the continued sale of ballistic missiles to states such as Syria, together with fears that the collapse of the Soviet Union will enable the unauthorised transfer of nuclear and other weapons technology. Moreover, much of the fall in the value of arms sales to the region is accounted for by the embargo against Iraq, which alone imported Dollars 27bn worth of weapons in the decade to 1990. Nothing perhaps better illustrates barriers to Middle East arms control than the lethargic response to Mr Bush's initiative, in which he called for a register of arms sales to the region, barriers to exports that contribute to weapons of mass destruction, a freeze - followed by a ban - on surface-to-surface missiles in the region, and a ban on the production of nuclear weapons material. Arms suppliers, notably the UN Security Council's five permanent members, were urged to avoid destabilising deals and asked to tighten export controls. But in the case of China, Mr Bush's pleas have apparently fallen on deaf ears. China's continuing reluctance to abide by the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTRC), a western initiative aimed at stopping the proliferation of missile technology, is a serious drag on efforts to halt the spread of ballistic missiles. At the same time, diplomatic efforts to create the anti-Saddam coalition in the Gulf war also helped make available to many countries in the region considerably more money to spend on arms. Arms supplies have also been boosted by the eagerness with which east European countries, particularly Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria, have sought to earn hard currency through weapon sales. Through such trade, arms experts believe, weapons such as sophisticated T-72 tanks may be changing hands for as little as Dollars 600,000 each - less than half the price they were two years ago. 'There are signs that Russia and the east Europeans can't abide by this (arms control) regime because of their foreign exchange needs,' says Professor Trevor Taylor of the Royal Institute for International Affairs in London. This sudden availability of advanced weaponry is fuelling the traditional vicious circle that has long characterised the regional arms race. Arab states want to erode Israel's 'qualitative edge', but Israel in turn seeks to extend it by developing and acquiring bigger and better systems. 'The old Soviet bloc was always very cautious about releasing new arms technology but now it doesn't seem to bother them,' says an Israeli intelligence official. 'They are ready to sell top-line Mig 29 aircraft, the latest T-72 tanks and advanced surface-to-air missiles. This is new and it is a worrying trend.' Israel's response has been to embark on its own quest for more sophisticated firepower. Projects such as the development of the joint US-Israeli Arrow ballistic missile interceptor and a home-grown intelligence satellite and integrated radar defence systems have been given priority. 'Smart' bombs, missiles and artillery shells - of the type used so spectacularly in the war against Iraq - are being developed, refined and bought. 'In the long run it will produce a much more sophisticated, more state-of-the-art army,' says a military official. Reports that Israel may have transferred unauthorised US missile technology to China, which in turn may have incorporated it in weapons sold to Arab states, plus the recent publicity given to a shipment of North Korean missiles to Iran and Syria, have drawn further attention to issues of technology 'leakage' and proliferation of weapons systems to the volatile Middle East. Iran has been the focus of much of this concern, notably since recent British press reports, which echoed claims by a US Republican congressional task force on terrorism and unconventional warfare, suggesting Tehran has acquired two tactical nuclear warheads from the former Soviet Central Asian states. Driven by its historic enmity withIraq and still smarting from defeat in the 1980-88 Gulf war, Iran has the motive and the means to acquire its own nuclear device. Military analysts suggest it should not be surprising if Middle Eastern states seek nuclear weapons, given Israel's cache of up to 100 nuclear warheads and, indeed, revelations about the extent of Iraq's nuclear weapons programme. In this respect there are particular worries in the west about China and North Korea as suppliers of nuclear and other advanced weapons technology to the area. A recent study of China's missile trade by the California-based Monterrey Institute of International Studies found that Chinese missile co-operation with developing states in terms of 'whole systems and subsystems, production assistance and technology transfer' represented the world's most comprehensive programme of providing missile know-how to such countries. It charged that China was assisting in the creation of new and powerful missile-producing states which are likely to operate outside any limitations (international or otherwise) on the sales of such systems. The glaring example was North Korea, which had become a prime supplier of missiles and missile technology to the Middle East, including Syria, Libya, Iran, Egypt and possibly Iraq. International pressure may have obliged China to defer shipments of the M-9 short-range missile to Syria, for which a contract was signed between Damascus and Beijing in 1987, but there is no sign the Chinese have abandoned plans to supply the missile. Indeed, reports this year that China had shipped to Syria chemicals suitable for production of solid-fuel missiles, allied with sightings of M-9 missile launchers in Syria, prompted speculation that the M-9 transfer is proceeding despite international pressure. An abiding US fear is that the positioning of substantial numbers of M-9 missiles in Syria - the missiles have a range of about 500km - raises the prospect of an Israeli pre-emptive strike, and thus the danger of a new Middle East war. Israeli officials say they are uncertain of the status of the M-9 deal. But they have repeatedly voiced public concern about up to 80 Scud-C missiles and 12 launchers they believe are being delivered to Syria by North Korea. Such spectres point up the desirability of some form of arms control regime in the region. But not only is there no such regime; the circumstances are auspicious neither for the imposition of one from outside, nor for development from within the region. President Hafez el-Assad of Syria has already made it clear that he opposes US attempts to limit Syria's ability to buy whatever weapons it likes, at least while Israel remains immune from western attempts to control arms in the region. For many analysts, no arms control regime will succeed in the area until there is a solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict. Arms control will be discussed in Washington in the next three days in the multilateral round of the Middle East peace talks - but no substantive progress on arms control is likely until the main item on the agenda, peace between Arab and Israeli, has made substantial progress. In the end, though, no amount of initiatives may succeed in dissuading the jostling powers of the region from buying exactly what they feel they need both for regional power and for their own defence. As Mr Don Kerr, analyst with Control Risks, the private defence consultants, says: 'Military procurement has its own inertia - it's something countries can never stop doing.'</p>

We also believe that a simple ``brightline'' test is needed for determining the coverage area of existing paging systems in order to facilitate the licensing of response channels. In considering this issue, we note that while existing paging operations include several classes of operations with varying service radii, a 20-mile (32.2 kilometer) radius of reliable service is typical of paging operations. We therefore believe that a 20-mile service radius would better reflect the service areas of most existing paging operations than the 25-mile standard suggested by NABER. At the same time, we recognize that, as specified in our rules, some paging operations have service areas larger than 20 or 25 miles. Accordingly, we will consider the service radius of a paging transmitter to be 20 miles for purposes of determining eligibility for response channel licenses, except that for certain classes of high-powered paging stations we will use a graduated series of wider service radii specified in our paging rules. <FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>  This standard will establish a clear and concise test for all applicants and minimize the administrative burden on our resources. Existing paging licensees will be eligible for response channels in any BTA or MTA that encompasses an authorized base station or which is partly or wholly overlapped by the paging system's service area as defined above. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> In the case of ``F,'' ``G,'' ``H,'' or ``K'' class paging stations under both Sections 22.502(c) and 90.495(b)(1) of our rules, the service area for purposes of response channel eligibility will be defined by the service area radius specified in Section 22.504(b)(2). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 10. We also find merit in NABER's request to allow existing licensees that expand their service areas after June 24, 1993, to be eligible for response channels in the expanded service areas. This request is consistent with our decision to provide opportunities for upgrading existing paging operations. We further agree with PageNet that any licensee operating a system that serves some portion of a market should be eligible to apply for response channels in that market, regardless of whether the licensee was operating before June 24, 1993. In this regard, we see no reason why operators of existing systems that have been expanded into adjacent trading areas after June 24, 1993, should be entitled to bid for response channels in newly served areas while operators of new systems authorized after that date should be barred from bidding for those channels. We therefore conclude that, as a matter of equity, the eligibility criterion should be modified to permit any paging licensee to apply for the response channels in a market, so long as the licensee's system serves some portion of that market on the date the application is filed. In particular, we note that on October 21, 1993, we adopted amendments to our private paging rules that resulted in the issuance of substantial numbers of new licensees for conventional paging. We find that licensees of both expanded systems and new systems authorized after June 24, 1993, should have an opportunity to purchase the response channels. Accordingly, we are amending the eligibility requirements for holding narrowband PCS response channels as follows. Existing paging licensees will be defined as paging licensees authorized under Part 22 or Part 90 of our Rules as of the deadline for filing applications to participate in the competitive bidding for the paging response channels. <FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>  This application filing deadline will be established in a public notice. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Mercury Communications, Inc. (Mercury) filed a petition for clarification of the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Third Report and Order  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> in the competitive bidding proceeding (PP Docket No. 93&hyph;253) requesting that the June 24, 1993 date apply only to the initial auction and that this date not apply should response channels remain available following the initial auction. Mercury states that it is an applicant to provide private carrier paging service at numerous locations in the New York City metropolitan area, but was not authorized in that area as of June 24, 1993. Mercury argues that it would not serve the public interest to forever preclude companies not authorized as of June 24, 1993 because paging is a dynamic, evolving industry. We believe that the revised rules we are adopting herein will remedy the inequity to which Mercury refers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Acquisition of Multiple Response Channels <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

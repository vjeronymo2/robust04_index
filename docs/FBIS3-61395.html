			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Report by Department of Information and the Press of the </F> Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Lithuania--ELTA: "Letter by P.  Gylys to the U.S. Secretary of State"]    [Text] Minister of Foreign Affairs of Lithuania Povilas  Gylys has sent a letter to U.S. Secretary of State Warren  Christopher.    Lithuania, reads the letter, is particularly interested in  close cooperation and assistance from the United States in the  area of national security and defense and the reinforcement of  economic reforms and democratic institutions.    Despite the fact that the last Russian soldier has left  Lithuania, we still find ourselves in a security vacuum, the  letter reads. The presence of the army of a foreign state in  Latvia and Estonia is a factor of instability in the entire  region. The large Russian Army concentration in Kaliningrad  Oblast gives rise to particular concern. Lithuania would like to  invite the attention of the international community to the need  to demilitarize this region.    The letter notes that the Russian notion of "neighboring  foreign countries" is unacceptable to Lithuania. The fact that  Russia's foreign policy may become more nationalistic and  aggressive with regard to the Baltic states following the  parliamentary elections also causes concern.    The minister noted that Lithuania, in its striving to blend  into Western political, economic, and security structures,  considers NATO its future security guarantor. Lithuania, in  which there is no foreign army and no problem of ethnic  minorities, strives to reinforce cooperation with NATO. We  welcome the "partnership," hoping that this will become a  stimulus for cooperation "from partnership to membership."    Foreign investment is an important factor in the development  of the economy of our country. U.S. investment is extremely  important to Lithuania in this context. Our country intends to  sign several treaties with the United States, including the  treaty "On Incentives and Protection for Investment."    Toward the end of the letter, the minister offered W.  Christopher and his family holiday wishes.</p>

			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / International Company News: Sekyra steels himself for repeat performance - Austrian Industries' chief has to start restructuring all over again THE danger of being good at something is that you become condemned to it for life. That seems to be the predicament of Mr Michael Sekyra, chief executive of Austrian Industries. Mr Sekyra earned a big reputation in Austria in the late 1980s for his success in rationalising the sprawling state- owned heavy industrial conglomerate and focusing it on four businesses; steel, plant engineering, aluminium and oil and petrochemicals. Dozens of plants were shut or sold, and nearly 30,000 jobs were eliminated between 1986, when he took the helm, and 1991. But after a three-year interlude of profits, the group tumbled back into heavy losses last year as recession and the emergence of eastern European competitors undermined some of its key businesses. Figures are not available yet, but the speculation in Vienna is that AI suffered a loss of about Sch2.9bn (Dollars 252m) last year, compared with a profit of Sch2.1bn in 1991. So now Mr Sekyra has to start restructuring all over again. His new goal is to compress the group to only two businesses, steel and engineering, with less than half its 1991 turnover of Sch170bn by the end of the decade. 'When we started in 1986, our target was to be competitive in western Europe and to be prepared for Austria joining the EC,' Mr Sekyra says. 'We have reached that target, but in the meantime we have been hit by an earthquake.' The end of communism in eastern Europe has been doubly tough for AI, depriving the group of markets while bringing new competitors desperate to earn hard currency. And it is poorly placed to fight back. 'We have high labour costs, high environmental protection expenses and a high exchange rate,' Mr Sekyra says, so he has to assess afresh 'what is the portfolio that we can survive with'. He is not optimistic about the group's chances in aluminium, and a huge loss at its Austria Metall (AMAG) subsidiary last year was the main contributor to the group's woes. AMAG's only Austrian smelter has been closed, participations in overseas smelters are for sale and AI is looking for partners for the fabricating operations. The group's big oil and chemical arm, OMV, which also suffered losses last year, has been sold back to OIAG, the main state holding company, pending sales of equity stakes to strategic partners. Several other minor holdings are up for sale, leaving steel and plant engineering as the two remaining pillars. At first glance, it is difficult to see how landlocked Austria can be a competitive steelmaker. But Mr Sekyra points out that the Voest Alpine Stahl works at Linz is close to the motor industries of south Germany, Italy and the Czech Republic, the main consumers of high quality, flat-rolled steel. Also, raw material costs have been helped by the development of an effective way to use low-cost Ukrainian iron ore in its blast furnace. The result is that VA Stahl is among the top three steelmakers in Europe on costs, a position it hopes to keep by investing heavily in lean production techniques. By the end of the century, Mr Sekyra sees AI as a steel and engineering group with the equivalent of DM10m (Dollars 6m) turnover (compared with roughly DM24bn today) and a split between steel and engineering of 30/70, compared with 60/40 today. 'Our idea is not to be among the biggest 50 companies in Europe, but to have a good balance of activities and stable results and to be fully privatised,' he says. The group originally hoped to float shares on the Vienna bourse this year, but this is now out of the question. 'We are now trying to find industrial banking partners. Our first step would be to sell 20 per cent to 30 per cent and then, after the recession, continue with plans for going public.' If Mr Sekyra has any regrets about abandoning the more ambitious structure he conceived in 1986, he conceals them well, although it is plain that the loss of OMV has been a blow. 'OMV faces big challenges. Because our plans to go to the stock exchange cannot be realised, we are not in a position to help them, so the decision was right to find a separate way,' he says. There has been speculation that Mr Sekyra, who is 52, does not get on well with Mr Viktor Klima, the new minister responsible for nationalised industries, and will soon leave AI. However, both men dismiss this. Mr Sekyra says: 'I have a contract until 1996. It is wrong to leave a ship in a storm.' Mr Klima, for his part, observes that AI still has to concentrate on restructuring and cost saving. 'Mr Sekyra has demonstrated that he is able to do these things. I think he really has a lot of strengths for this period.'</p>

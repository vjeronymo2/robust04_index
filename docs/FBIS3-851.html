			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by President Joaquim Chissano at ceremony in </F> Massinga troop assembly area, in southern Inhambane Province, on  10 March--recorded]    [Excerpts] Mozambique Armed Forces/Popular Forces for the  Liberation of Mozambique [FAM/FPLM] soldiers, noncommissioned  officers, and officers: we are here in Massinga today, 10 March,  to formally begin the troop demobilization process in accordance  with the stipulations of the General Peace Accord which was  signed in Rome between the government of the Republic of  Mozambique and the Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo]. In  terms of the General Peace Accord, the process for the creation  of the Mozambique Defense Armed Forces [FADM] will occur  simultaneously with the assembly and integration into civilian  life of FAM/FPLM soldiers who are progressively demobilized as a  result of the implementation of the cease-fire accord. The  General Peace Accord also states that all units must be  demobilized by the time FADM is fully staffed.    Even though the troop confinement process is not over yet  and  the formation of the FADM forces has met with some problems, it  is important that troop demobilization begins, principally for  the following reasons:     -  The troop confinement process was conceived of as a stage  in the transition to civilian life or to the FADM forces. That  stage should not have lasted longer than one month.  Unfortunately, you have had to stay longer than that at this  assembly area due to unforeseen reasons;    -  Most of the confined soldiers are to be demobilized;    -  There is the imperative need to speed up the implementation  of  the General Peace Accord by removing difficulties and making it  easier for its goals to be achieved;    -  Most troop assembly areas are more than 100 percent full, so  it  is imperative to demobilize soldiers so that space can be opened  for other soldiers to be confined;    -  Basic organizational and financial conditions are already in  place for demobilization to begin.       The Mozambican Government has decided to begin demobilizing  its forces for all these reasons, and in the spirit which guided  the signing of the General Peace Accord. We can clarify at this  stage that this is no unilateral demobilization. Instead, it is  a matter of the government taking the first step in a  simultaneous demobilization process that must be complied with  by both sides. In view of that, the government, Renamo, and the  UN Operations in Mozambique must guarantee that the process  occurs simultaneously for both sides. Demobilization is an  import stage in the process for strengthening peace in this  country. It is an important stage in redirecting our country's  human, material, and financial resources so they can be used to  rebuild the nation, to improve the people's living standards,  and to help develop our country's social and economic sectors.    FAM/FPLM soldiers, noncommissioned officers, and officers:  those of you who are leaving today to rejoin your families,  whether it be in urban or rural areas, are leaving their  uniforms and weapons today to rejoin civilian life. We have  come here on behalf of the Mozambican State and the Mozambican  people, united from Rovuma River to Maputo River, to pay the  nation's homage to its beloved sons. [passage omitted]    The sodliers who are getting demobilized today have fought  for peace. The principal goal of demobilization is to solidify  peace by neutralizing the reasons for war. So, demobilization  cannot and should not be a unilateral move, or it may become the  reason for new conflicts. A simultaneous demobilization process  means that there are neither victors nor vanquished. The  Mozambican people are the sole winners in that they gain much  desired peace.    To you, the heroes, we do not hesitate to pay due homage for  the heroism you have shown in your struggle to defend freedom  and our fatherland's independence. We are proud to pay you  homage today. It is with pride that you must now return to your  homes in the country's cities and rural areas, because you have  accomplished your mission. You must now work to help solidify  peace and normalize the lives of all our people, including your  own lives. You will know how to behave in line with the spirit  of reconciliation, freedom, dignity, and justice. [passage  omitted]    While you prepare for your new professions, you will  continue  getting financial support for two years, the first six months of  which will be paid directly by the state. The other 18 months  will be the result of generous contributions and support by the  international community, which has decided to listen to the  Mozambican Government's call for increased efforts in that  direction. We are well aware of the fact that you have many  needs but only very limited financial resources, but that is all  the government and the international community can make  available. We do not have the means to satify our desire to  give you more.    In addition to those salaries, upon arrival in the area  where he wants to settle for good, each demobilized soldier will  receive complementary support in terms of seeds, agricultural  tools, and other small production tools that will help them  resume productive work. That means that we need to work very  hard so that we can guarantee our own upkeep and create  surpluses that will help stabilize and raise our standards of  living. Only work can help us improve. Only disciplined work  can release us from famine, poverty, and misery. [passage  omitted]    The government is well aware of the fact that the most  important consideration, in all this, is the creation of  conditions that will guarantee work for each citizen. However,  it is up to us and our efforts alone to create really stable  jobs. We have to continue working very hard. [passage omitted]    Some of you have expressed a desire to be paid the first six  months in full upon demobilization. Though the government views  with sympathy the reasons for your concern, it is nonetheless  important that you do not arrive in your homes empty-handed.  The government will pay promptly the first three months when  you get demobilized. You will receive the remainder in your  districts. Conditions are being created to ensure that everyone  will receive his dues, even in areas where there are no banks or  administrative posts. [passage omitted]    We want you to be an important factor in the development of  the national economy and in the reconstruction of the fatherland  for whose freedom, sovereignty, and territorial integrity you  fought so hard and gave so much of your youth. The people and  the government expect of you that you will be the safekeepers of  peace, freedom, and democracy wherever you may be. [passage  omitted]    Long live the FAM/FPLM forces!    Long live the Mozambican people, united from Rovuma River to  Maputo River!    Long live the Republic of Mozambique!    Long live national unity!    Long live hard work!    Long live democracy!    Long live peace!</p>

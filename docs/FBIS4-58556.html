			<p>BFN     [Text] The government has decided as a matter of policy not  to carry out executions of criminals sentenced to death in  public despite the powers vested in it to do so under Section 10  of the Special Courts for Speedy Trials Act 1992. The present  government respects the human dignity and upholds the human  values as upheld by the civilized and progressive societies of  the world.</p>

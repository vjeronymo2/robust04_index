			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by K. K.: "Latvia Has Just Barely Been Joined to the </F> CIS"]    [Text] On Monday paramilitary formations subordinated to  the Latvian Ministry of Internal Affairs undertook provocative  actions against Russian military installations, the embassy, and  certain representatives in Riga.    As we have learned from reliable sources, had the situation  exacerbated, the airborne and military transport aviation forces  which were put on alert could have accomplished the combined  employment of paratroopers in Riga. In accordance with plans  worked out in the last years of the USSR's existence (under  which the 1991 military actions in the Baltic region were held),  the troops arriving from Russia would have unblocked and taken  our installations under guard. All of this would have been  strongly reminiscent of the evacuation of the Soviet Embassy in  Afghanistan.    The initiator of the military option was Minister Kozyrev,  who asked General Grachev to take the requisite measures.    According to competent sources in the Foreign Affairs  Ministry, the provocation could be linked to the new round of  bilateral negotiations on the fate of Russian military  installations in Latvia as well as to President Clinton's  European tour. If everything were quiet, then, according to Mr.  Prikhodko, head of the Baltic Division at the Second European  Department, one could "hope for a breakthrough." After  apologies by the Latvian side the talks, scheduled for two to  three days, went ahead, although later than planned. The  Foreign Affairs Ministry is still expecting explanations on a  higher level with a mandatory indication of the organizers and  perpetrators of the provocation, the punishment meted out to  them, and so forth. The incident was discussed at a night  emergency session of the Latvian Government. A couple of minor  officials were dismissed.</p>

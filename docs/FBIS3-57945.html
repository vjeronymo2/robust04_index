			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Patrice Henry Desaubliaux: "The Necessary </F> Resumption of Nuclear Testing"]    [Text] The report of Paris RPR [Rally for the  Republic] Deputy Rene Galy-Dejean estimates that 10 or so tests  will be essential to perfect the PALEN simulation program.    "Irrefragable." At the end of a six-week in-depth  investigation, the fact-finding mission arranged last 28 October  by the Defense Committee of the National Assembly reached this  conclusion: The "unrefutable, something that cannot be  challenged" (that is the definition according to the Petit  Robert dictionary) conclusion is that "France must be able to  conduct nuclear testing." This "requirement" is called for  "whether from the standpoint of weapon performance, safety, and  reliability, the sign of deterrence, or, in any event, from that  of perfecting a simulation system."    Written by Rene Galy-Dejean (RPR, Paris) and unequivocally  approved by the members of the fact-finding mission--Jacques  Baumel (RPR), Jean Michel Boucheron (PS [Socialist Party]),  Daniel Colin (UDF [Union for French Democracy]), Pierre Favre  (UDF), and Pierre Lellouche (RPR)--the 60-page report opens, for  the first time at the parliamentary level and therefore  publicly, the scientific and technical dossier of nuclear  armament. It is its first characteristic. It shows that, without  revealing national defense secrets, it is possible to extend the  debate on such an essential issue, affecting the independence  and security of France, to others than groups of experts.    Without useless polemic--and that is its second major  characteristic--this report has, nonetheless, political scope.  It must be read according to the two "goals of the French  defense policy," recalled on 6 October by the communique  published simultaneously by the office of the president and that  of the prime minister: One of the goals is "to participate in  the arms limitation effort within the international community";  the other is "to have always available a believable and adequate  deterrence force to protect its vital interests, which is  currently the case and which must remain the case tomorrow."  <H5>  New Methods of Calculations </H5>   This second goal assumes the "maintenance and development of  France's technological capability," the implementation of  "safeguarding measures making it possible to arrange at any  moment a new testing campaign," and finally the acquisition of  "techniques of simulation which, alone, can guarantee the  continuity of our deterrence once testing has been definitely  stopped."    It is in that context that the Galy-Dejean report concluded  that nuclear testing is "essential." How many tests? Some 20,  according to the experts, of which 10 or so could be assigned to  the PALEN program (which means, let us recall, "aid program for  the limitation of nuclear testing"). Within what delays? The  report has sought to be particularly careful on this issue: "If  perfecting the PALEN program were the sole purpose of the  testing, it is not at all sure that a quick resumption of the  firing tests would be necessary. On the other hand, it is  conceivable that the majority of the tests related to this  program will be truly useful after 1995."    It so happens that the perfecting of the PALEN program, not  before the year 2000, is not a minor matter. It demands new  methods of calculations, that is to say, "computers, at least 50  times more powerful and rapid than the current ones, which do  not yet exist on the marketplace, not even in the United  States." The Atomic Energy Commission (CEA) should be able to  acquire some in 1997. It demands also radiographic methods that  will not be "put into service before 1998" and lasers (for a  minimum cost of 5 billion francs) "delivering an energy of two  megajoules," whereas the CEA's largest laser delivers only 20  kilojoules.    It remains that the PALEN has its own limitations ("It will  never be possible to simulate nuclear tests.") and, above all,  that tests have objectives other than the perfecting of this  program. It is necessary, among other things, to develop the  TN-100 intended for the future M-5's. Whereas any new  product--car, electrical appliances, machine-tool, etc.--is  always tested before its final utilization, "is it possible to  believe that a nuclear weapon would be the only thing that could  be completed without being tested? In this case, how could its  reliability be believed, as much from the standpoint of its  military effectiveness as of its safety and security?" In this  context, the American experience of a moratorium precedent,  between 1958 and 1961, is rich in lessons. Today still, "no one  knows how to foresee the aging of nuclear matters at the end of  20 years."    In his report, Galy-Dejean took great care to mention the  international context of the French problematics: The  technological advance of the United States which, alone, knows  how to carry out experiments that cannot be detected and the  strategic objective of which is clearly to dig irretrievably the  ditch between itself and the other nuclear powers; the will of  China to acquire high-level nuclear armament; Japan's  technological competence which, some day, could stop excluding  the nuclear option; and the diplomatic agenda that features the  renewal of the Non-Proliferation Treaty in 1995 and the signing  (in 1996?) of a treaty prohibiting nuclear testing.    Resuming nuclear testing is, therefore, the inner conviction  of the fact-finding mission. This does not prevent some of its  members from adding their own commentaries to express subtleties  or reservations. Thus, Jean-Michel Boucheron, a Socialist,  retains only these sections of the report that would not  displease the president of the Republic. Thus, Jacques Baumel  and Pierre Lellouche would have liked to see "clearly" indicated  "the absolute necessity of resuming the tests between now and  1995." Beyond these opinions, as revealed by the chairman of the  Defense Committee Jacques Boyon (RPR, Ain), there remains the  confirmation of a real consensus around nuclear deterrence.</p>

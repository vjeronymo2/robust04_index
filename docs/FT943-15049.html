			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / Foreign banks face costs blow in London The costs of setting up and running an international bank branch in London have continued to rise during the past two years - after a dip in 1992 - to record levels in many cases. The findings come in an analysis by Noel Alexander Associates, a consultancy which specialises in financial statistics. It looked at four separate cases  -setting up just a London representative office, or establishing a branch in any one of three sizes. The study showed, for example, that both the opening and annual costs of setting up a small branch, at Pounds 2.14m and Pounds 984,000 respectively, were above the previous records of Pounds 1.86m (in April 1993) and Pounds 963,900 (in February 1990). The annual cost of running a medium-size branch was estimated at Pounds 2.24m, compared with Pounds 2.12m in April last year. The opening cost for such a branch was Pounds 3.28m - above the level of last year but slightly down on the record of Pounds 3.30m in February 1990. The study also highlighted the notably higher costs of setting up a representative office using an expatriate rather than a UK resident. Start-up cost of such an office with an expatriate was estimated at Pounds 822,550, while with a local representative it falls to Pounds 273,590. Annual running costs are also cheaper for the local option - Pounds 235,370 against Pounds 308,520. A marked change compared with some previous years is that property costs make up only a small proportion - about one-tenth - of the total calculations. This is partly because, the consultancy says, the London property market is such that it is possible to negotiate two or three years' occupation rent-free. Staff costs are the largest single element in the estimated budgets, ranging up to three-quarters of the totals. The number of foreign banks in London has been rising in recent years, and is now more than 500. Bank Case Studies. Noel Alexander Associates, 6 Broad Street Place, Blomfield Street, London EC2M 7JU.

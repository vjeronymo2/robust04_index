			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (i) Are substantially similar to the terms of this provision or to the clause at 52.232&hyph;16, Progress Payments, for any subcontractor that is a large business concern, or that clause with its Alternate I for any subcontractor that is a small business concern;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Are at least as favorable to the Government as the terms of this clause;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Are not more favorable to the subcontractor or division than the terms of this clause are to the Contractor;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) Are substantially in conformance with the requirements of paragraph 32.504(e) of the Federal Acquisition Regulation; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (v) Subordinate all subcontractor rights concerning property to which the Government has title under the subcontract to the Government's right to require delivery of the property to the Government if (A) the Contractor defaults or (B) the subcontractor becomes bankrupt or insolvent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) The progress payment rate in the subcontract is the customary rate used by the Contracting Agency, depending on whether the subcontractor is or is not a small business concern.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) The parties agree concerning any proceeds received by the Government for property to which title has vested in the Government or against which a lien has been placed in favor of the Government under the subcontract terms, that the proceeds shall be applied to reducing any unliquidated progress payments by the Government to the Contractor under this contract.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) If no unliquidated progress payments to the Contractor remain, but there are unliquidated progress payments that the Contractor has made to any subcontractor, the Contractor shall be subrogated to all the rights the Government obtained through the terms required by this clause to be in any subcontract, as if all such rights had been assigned and transferred to the Contractor.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) To facilitate small business participation in subcontracting under this contract, the Contractor agrees to provide progress payments to small business concerns, in conformity with the standards for customary progress payments stated in subpart 32.5 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Contractor further agrees that the need for such progress payments shall not be considered as a handicap or adverse factor in the award of subcontracts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Retentions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Upon preliminary acceptance of each vessel and upon the submission of properly certified invoices, the Government will pay to the Contractor the amount withheld under paragraph (a) of this requirement in respect of that vessel in excess of (i) a performance reserve in the amount of one and one-half percent (1.5%) of the total contract price for such vessel, or (ii) one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000), whichever is greater. If at any time it shall appear to the Government that the amount of performance reserve may be insufficient to meet the cost to the Government of finishing any unfinished work under the contract for which the Contractor is responsible, or of correcting defects for which the Contractor is responsible which are discovered prior to preliminary acceptance or during the guaranty period of any vessel, the Government may, in making payments under this requirement, deduct or withhold such additional amounts as it may determine to be necessary to render such reserve adequate; provided, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  that any additional amounts deducted or withheld on account of defects which are discovered during the guaranty period of the vessel shall not exceed the limit of the Contractor's liability as set forth in the requirement entitled LIMITATION OF CONTRACTOR'S LIABILITY FOR CORRECTION OF DEFECTS'', reduced by the amounts of the cost incurred by the Contractor for work on such vessel because of Contractor responsible deficiencies which are discovered during the guaranty period of the vessel.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The Government may, in its discretion, make payments prior to final settlement on account of the reserves established under this requirement, subject to such conditions precedent as the Contracting Officer may prescribe.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The Government shall, at the time of final settlement, in accordance with the provisions of the requirement entitled ``FINAL SETTLEMENT'', pay the Contractor the balance owing to it under the contract promptly after the amount of such balance shall have been determined.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (g)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Liens and title <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> . For liens and title provisions, see the requirement of this contract entitled ``LIENS AND TITLE''.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (h)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Certifications and audits. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  At any time or times prior to final payment under this contract, the Contracting Officer may have any invoices and statements or certifications of costs audited. The Contracting Officer may require the Contractor to submit, or make available for examination by the Contracting Officer or his designated representative, the supporting documentation upon which invoices, statements or certifications of costs are based. Each payment theretofore made shall be subject to reduction as necessary to reflect the exclusion of amounts included in the invoices or statements or certifications of costs which are found by the Contracting Officer, on the basis of such audit, not to constitute allowable costs. Any payment may be reduced for overpayments, or increased for underpayments on preceding invoices.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Reduction or suspension. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  The Contracting Officer may reduce or suspend progress payments after finding on substantial evidence of any of the following conditions:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The Contractor failed to comply with any material requirement of this contract.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Performance of this contract is endangered by the Contractor's (i) failure to make progress or (ii) unsatisfactory financial condition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Inventory allocated to this contract substantially exceeds reasonable requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) The Contractor is delinquent in payment of the costs of performing this contract in the ordinary course of business.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

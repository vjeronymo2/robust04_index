			<p><P> September 23, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONSUMER REPORT: IF TROUBLE IS AHEAD, WHO'S LOOKING OUT?;  </P> <P> CONSUMER: STATE DEPARTMENT OFFERS HELP;  </P> <P> ADVISORIES: THE BEST SOURCE FOR TIMELY INFORMATION ON DESTINATIONS ABROAD IS  THE STATE DEPARTMENT, WHICH ISSUES REGULAR UPDATES.  </P> <P> It's not always easy for travelers to get up-to-date information on countries  they plan to visit.  </P> <P> Travel agents are supposed to alert travelers to potential hazards. Suppliers  such as airlines, cruise lines and tour operators can provide helpful  information, too, though their advice may be a bit self-serving. Ditto for  foreign government tourist offices.  </P> <P> But there is another key information resource available to travelers: the  travel advisories put out by the U.S. State Department. These directives,  issued as often as necessary and on a country-by-country basis, cover a variety  of circumstances -- from warfare, terrorism, outbreaks of disease and lack of  hotel rooms to natural disasters such as earthquakes and floods.  </P> <P> "The advisories can be cautionary or outright warnings," said Nyda Novodvorsky,  a State Department spokeswoman. "Most of the advisories are cautions that cover  unusual travel conditions or serious health problems. We don't tell travelers  not to go, but if they do go, to be aware of certain situations.  </P> <P> "Warnings are more serious. In some instances, we urge travelers not to go.  Examples would be Lebanon and Libya. In other cases, the suggestion is to be  especially careful."  </P> <P> Generally, warnings signal the threat of possible physical danger or violence  stemming from terrorism, civil disorder or natural disaster.  </P> <P> Each advisory is specific in whether it is cautionary or an outright warning,  and whether the situation is life-threatening or just an inconvenience such as  a shortage of hotel space. Advisories may also pinpoint precise areas in a  country that pose potential problems.  </P> <P> Most of the information prompting the advisories comes from American embassies  and consulates overseas.  </P> <P> "Advisories can be for a short or long period," Novodvorsky said. "Each case is  different. We monitor events to see whether we should extend, amend or end the  advisory."  </P> <P> If the State Department views the destination as having ongoing problems, the  advisories may extend for as long as a year. "Some African countries, like  Kenya and South Africa, have had long-term advisories," Novodvorsky said.  "Kenya has gone from caution to a warning for a short period, and now back to  caution."  </P> <P> Recently, the State Department reissued a travel advisory for using caution  while traveling through certain parts of South Africa.  </P> <P> A warning advisory on Peru was issued because of concern over possible acts of  terrorism in connection with two Peruvian terrorist groups, the Shining Path  and MRTA, who have occasionally targeted Americans and U.S. government  installations for attack.  </P> <P> The advisory, which was sent out July 20 and is expected to remain in effect  until July 19, 1991, cautions primarily against travel to remote regions, warns  of street crime in busy market areas of Lima and the possibility of incidents  in Machu Picchu and Cuzco. In addition, hikers are advised to avoid the Inca  Trail because of possible contact with criminals and terrorists.  </P> <P> "If you do go ahead and travel someplace after we've issued a warning, let our  people know of your presence," said Novodvorsky, who suggested registering with  the U.S. embassy or consulate upon arrival.  </P> <P> Advisories aren't binding on visitors or the suppliers who offer travel to and  within troubled areas. However, they do have an impact on bookings, tending to  diminish travel to areas where an advisory is in effect. Not surprisingly,  suppliers often disagree on the need for an advisory and the amount of time  they stay in effect.  </P> <P> Several tour operators offering packages to Peru believe that the Peru advisory  is worded more strongly than necessary.  </P> <P> Miami-based Ladatco Tours has made no changes in its itineraries to Peru, said  spokeswoman Annie Berk, who added that Ladatco is monitoring the situation.  </P> <P> "The State Department can't understate the issue," said Tammy Vu, a spokeswoman  for Santa Ana-based Travcoa. "They have to state the maximum danger, which  doesn't mean it will happen."  </P> <P> The fact that an advisory hasn't been issued may also be used to stimulate  travel. For example, the Israel Government Tourist Office recently issued a  release indicating that "no travel advisory has been issued by the State  Department concerning travel to Israel."  </P> <P> In general, say suppliers, if they continue to keep their product in the  marketplace, it's safe. "We're not going to sail in an unsafe area," said  Dennis Fuerst, vice president of reservations for Princess Cruises.  </P> <P> "We monitor the advisories, but we make our own judgment on whether we should  eliminate or amend a tour," said Rale Edwards of El Segundo-based Olson  Travelworld.  </P> <P> "We wouldn't proceed if we thought there was any danger. We stopped operating  tours in Beijing and Shanghai when, based on the advisory and our own ground  operators in China, we thought those areas were unsafe. And then when the  problems seemed to encompass all of China, we pulled all of our tours."  </P> <P> The advisory information is couched in general terms, meaning travelers have to  evaluate the situation based on their own plans.  </P> <P> "We're obligated to alert consumers to advisories, and we would then ask  clients to sign disclaimers that they have been made aware of the relevant  situations," said Sue Boucher, manager of Los Angeles-based Ferguson Gates  Travel.  </P> <P> Legal situations have arisen over consumers being made aware of advisories by  travel agents and other members of the industry.  </P> <P> If the company continues to offer the product while an advisory is in effect  and the traveler opts to cancel, chances are that the traveler will be held to  any cancellation penalty that becomes operative. However, this is a matter of  company policy and, to some extent, consumer perseverance.  </P> <P> To get a copy of any State Department advisory, call (202) 647-5225. This is a  recorded announcement, but travelers can pinpoint the area they are interested  in receiving information about and leave their address.  </P> <P> Advisories may also be posted in passport offices, and are available in various  computerized data-base services offered to the public.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Chen Maodi (7115 3029 1717)] </F>   [Text] Shanghai, 9 Feb (XINHUA) -- Wu Bangguo, member of  the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau and secretary of the  Shanghai Municipal Party Committee, and Shanghai Mayor Huang Ju  today extended Spring Festival greetings to Comrade Chen Yun in  Shanghai, wishing him happiness, health, and longevity.    Comrade Chen Yun happily received the Shanghai comrades and  had cordial conversations with them.    Wu Bangguo reported to Comrade Chen Yun on the work Shanghai  did last year in launching reforms, opening up to the outside  world, developing the economy, and maintaining social stability,  as well as what Shanghai plans to do this year. Comrade Chen  Yun was very satisfied with the report. He said: Shanghai has  done a good job, not just good, but very good.    Comrade Chen Yun said: Since the Third Plenary Session of  the 13th CPC Central Committee in 1978, the nation's economy has  developed very quickly and the people's living standards have  improved greatly. This is a fact everybody can see. Of course,  there are still many difficulties and problems. To solve these  difficulties and problems, it is necessary to first safeguard  and strengthen the authority of the party Central Committee with  Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core. Without the authority of the  party Central Committee, there will be no major accomplishments,  and social stability cannot be maintained.    Comrade Chen Yun said: The party Central Committee has  decided to implement the revenue-sharing system this year so  that central authorities can gradually pool together the  necessary financial resources. Shanghai and other localities  have agreed to this. This shows that you have taken the  interests of all into consideration. I am very pleased about  this.    Comrade Chen Yun said: The situation of the entire country  shows that in current economic work, we should pay particular  attention to one issue, namely the size of our construction  projects must be compatible with the national strength. In  addition, there should be some leeway to maneuver. Meanwhile,  we should focus our attention on achieving higher economic  efficiency.    Comrade Chen Yun stressed: The current central leading body  is a strong and capable one, and has done a good job. People  throughout the country must work with one heart and one mind,  unite as one, and fully implement the series of policies and  measures adopted by the party Central Committee and the State  Council for carrying out macroeconomic regulation and control.  There is great hope for China to boost its economic  development, and a bright future for socialist China.</p>

			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / International Company News: Agnelli maps out route for disposals FIAT, Italy's largest private group, plans to raise up to L3,000bn (Dollars 1.9bn) this year in asset sales to offset the cost of rising debt and the prospect of a 1993 operating loss close to L1,000bn. The Turin-based automotive group has used asset sales to shore up profits over the past two years. The sale of Fiat's 25 per cent stake in Alcatel Italia, the telecoms group formed largely from its Telettra subsidiary, raised L700bn. But the divestiture target revealed yesterday by Mr Giovanni Agnelli, Fiat chairman, after the company's annual meeting, represents a far more significant disposal of non-strategic assets. Mr Agnelli declined to say whether discussions were under way for specific disposals, but implied Toro, Fiat's insurance arm, was first in line, and said the Rinascente stores group was being courted. He also indicated that Fiat's indirect ownership of Corriere Della Sera, the Milan newspaper, held through Gemina, was not a core investment. Mr Agnelli is due to step down at the next annual meeting after 28 years as chairman. He offered shareholders a bleak view of 1993 results against the backdrop of declining demand in the core vehicle business. In 1992, the automotive sector accounted for almost 80 per cent of the group's L59,100bn turnover. 'The figures we have for April-May not only confirm the recessionary trend but show it worsening, at least in Italy,' Mr Agnelli said. He confirmed analysts' estimates of a 1993 operating loss of L1,000bn with revenues 'roughly the same as 1992'. Mr Agnelli said the group would invest L8,000bn this year which could not all be met from the group's resources. Already this year Fiat's net financial position had reached a deficit of nearly L7,000bn and could reach L10,000bn by the year-end. This compares with L3,800bn at the end of 1992 but he insisted the higher borrowing would still be within sound debt-equity ratio limits. His comments were seen as an attempt to allay fears that the company was sitting on a pile of undisclosed debt. The group agreed to set aside L244bn to cover a reduced dividend - L100 on each ordinary and preference share and L130 on each savings share against L230 and L260 last year.</p>

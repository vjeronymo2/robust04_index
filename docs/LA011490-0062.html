			<p><P> January 14, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONSUMER REPORT: DAMAGE WAIVER COST TO BE ADDED TO CAR RENTAL  </P> <P> The cost of a collision damage waiver from Hertz or Avis in Europe will be  added to the regular rates as of April 1.  </P> <P> Hertz is dropping its optional CDW coverage for travelers who rent cars at its  1990 Affordable Europe weekly rates. Consequently, there will be an average  price increase of about 8% to offset the loss of revenue from selling the CDW,  according to Simon Todd, vice president for international sales and marketing  for Hertz.  </P> <P> "But now travelers know they are covered, and we want to erase from their minds  any possible doubt," Todd said. "American travelers will have a greater feeling  of security."  </P> <P> This move followed on the heels of Hertz's drive to eliminate the CDW in the  United States.  </P> <P> "There has been a good deal of confusion in the past year and a half by  consumers on what their credit card coverage of CDW really covered in Europe  and elsewhere," Todd said.  </P> <P> "The credit-card companies recently began offering this extra coverage, but  each company has different policies, and sometimes Hertz is called upon to  explain the policies of the credit card organizations. Travelers should, of  course, ask their credit card issuer, not us."  </P> <P> One of the major differences between credit card and regular CDW protection  comes in distinguishing between primary and secondary coverage.  </P> <P> Primary coverage means that if you have an accident the credit card company  will take care of it without any reference to any insurance you might have,  whereas secondary coverage means that the credit card company will only cover  any liability not covered by your own insurance company.  </P> <P> Another source of confusion comes from the fact that CDW can mean different  things in Europe than in the United States. Not too long ago Hertz revised its  CDW into LDW, or Loss Damage Waiver.  </P> <P> The latter term broadens the renter's responsibility to cover theft and  vandalism. But in Europe the term CDW is still used, and it just means  collision and damage coverage, excluding theft and vandalism.  </P> <P> While Hertz is still offering the option of CDW in Europe, the rates vary  according to the model of car and the country where you rent the car.  </P> <P> Some Hertz-provided samples of daily CDW rates: $6.30 to $15.80 in the United  Kingdom, $8.55 to $14.45 in France and $12.35 to $20.95 in West Germany. And  you have to pay the value-added tax on this CDW tab as part of your car rental  cost in countries that levy such a tax.  </P> <P> You also can't buy CDW separately in Hertz's Affordable Australia, New Zealand  or Asia/Pacific programs. Coverage in those programs is included in the basic  rate.  </P> <P> On April 1 Avis will eliminate any liability on the part of consumers who rent  a car for use in Europe through its Super Value program, according to Jerry  Kelly, director of sales and marketing for Europe for Avis.  </P> <P> "The whole aim is to simplify the rental process and enable renters to know  exactly what their cost is, and not be concerned with whether or not to buy  options," Kelly said.  </P> <P> Moreover, Avis will also include personal liability insurance as part of its  rental price with this new program. "Previously, renters just had third-party  liability coverage, such as cases where other people sue you, as part of their  basic cost."  </P> <P> Now you also get personal liability, which you would have had to pay for in the  past through PAI, or personal accident insurance.  </P> <P> "Let's say you broke your leg in Europe in a car accident and the medical cost  was $3,000. If you didn't have PAI, it would be up to you or your insurer to  pay this amount.  </P> <P> "Under our new system you're covered up to a certain amount per country, with  Avis providing your primary coverage. If the cost went over our coverage, then  you'd go to whatever type of insurer you had providing secondary coverage."  </P> <P> Avis customers do face a rise in car rental prices to cover these changes,  Kelly admitted. "The increases will reflect the umbrella of extra values we're  offering renters, which includes more travel itinerary planning assistance  before you leave the United States and toll-free numbers in major European  countries where you can call an English-speaking person for advice on any  travel-related subject, such as where to find a doctor or dentist, and not just  car repair places."  </P> <P> Until April 1 Avis will continue to offer a two-tier system, with one rate  structure including CDW and PAI, as well as the value-added tax. Renters can  still choose a lower rate in the Super Value program, where they have the  option of buying CDW or PAI (with no choice regarding the VAT).  </P> <P> Depending on the country in Europe, the inclusive Super Value rate is 10% to  18% more than the rate permitting the CDW option, Kelly added.  </P> <P> The type of credit card you have, as well as the issuer, may determine what  type of CDW coverage you have. Find out if you're entitled to primary or  secondary coverage. More expensive cards, of course, are more likely to provide  primary coverage, as well as other related perks.  </P> <P> Here's what three major credit-card outfits said about their CDW provisions:  </P> <P>  -- According to a spokesman for Visa, whether CDW coverage is included, and  whether or not that coverage is primary or secondary, depends on the type of  card and the bank the card is issued through.  </P> <P>  -- All American Express cards offer what the company calls "car rental loss  and damage protection," with primary coverage in Europe, an American Express  spokeswoman said.  </P> <P>  -- A Diners Club International spokeswoman said that it offers primary  coverage through its CDW provision.  </P></p>

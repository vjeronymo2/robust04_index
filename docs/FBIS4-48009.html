			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Angela Quintal] </F>   [Text] Johannesburg May 9 SAPA -- The National Land  Committee [NLC] has urged the new government to urgently review  the property rights and restitution clauses of the interim Bill  of Rights -- which it claims severely limits land reform -- or  face unprecedented chaos in rural areas with landless  communities forcibly reoccupying land. At a Johannesburg news  conference on Monday [9 May], the committee said it was  particularly concerned about constitutionally entrenched  market-related compensation for farmers whose land might be  expropriated. If it was calculated at "market value" then  farmers would be enriched for the second time -- first they were  enriched through apartheid when they bought their land cheaply  -- when the state bought back the land, spokesperson Lydia  Mariha said. [sentence as received] The committee said the  market-related formula would leave no resources to continue with  an effective redistribution programme.    The national land committee said it was a pity the African  National Congress had not attained the required two-thirds  majority to change the constitution. It felt hopeful, however,  that the ANC would review the property rights and restitution  clauses, as promised by President-elect Nelson Mandela in his  meeting with community representative in March this year.    Turning to redistribution, the NLC said it welcomed the  ANC's  commitment to redistribute "30 per cent of the land in the first  five years" as set out in its Reconstruction and Development  Programme. As the ANC had said state land alone would be used  for the purpose of redistribution and restitution, the  government's ability to fulfil its commitment would be severely  limited. The World Bank's figures of available arable state  land, about 250,000 hectares, would not be nearly enough for  these objective, it stressed.    By the South African Agricultural Union's own admission only  20 per cent of farmers produced 80 per cent of the country's  present agricultural produce. The land owned by the remaining  80 per cent should therefore be used for redistribution and for  aspirant black farmers, the committee said.    Although it welcomed the land claims court proposal unveiled  by the ANC, the committee said the court would work only if it  ran alongside "broader processes of land redistribution,  agricultural reform and restructuring of the administrative  structures in local government". The cases the land claims  court had been set up to deal with represented only "the tip of  the iceberg" and a comprehensive land reform process would be  needed to resolve the problems of groups who would not benefit  from the court, including communities with no land and those  that did have claims to a specific piece of land.    The Land Committee also expressed fears that landless  people's expectations would be pushed aside in favour of white  farmers' expectations and that unaccountable officials might be  appointed in the government's land ministries and departments.  Communities were expecting the new government to protect them  from evictions and to guarantee security of tenure. In  particular they demanded the moratorium on evictions, which was  drawn up by the Transitional Executive Council, be extended  through the transition period.    The NLC warned that if a new government shied away from  tackling the issue of land reform, and was seen as siding with  the white farming community, then rural communities would "feel  forced to reoccupy their land".    Transvaal Rural Action Committee spokesman Star Motswege  added communities were organising themselves already and if  their demands were not met within a certain period, a number of  them would forcibly reoccupy land.    The National Land Committee's Brendan Pearce said 11  communities in the Northern Cape had taken a resolution before  the elections to go back to their land by force if necessary.  One such community had already done so and 150 people were  arrested for trespassing. Mr Pearce said if there was no  substantial progress then more communities would resort to the  same action.    Mr Dave Husy, of the farmworkers resource and research  programme, said if the constitution could not be amended because  of the ANC's failure to achieve a two-thirds majority, a crisis  situation might erupt in rural areas and parliament would be  forced to change the property and restitution clauses for the  sake of peace in these areas.</p>

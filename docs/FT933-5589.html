			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Expanded Johnston Press rises to Pounds 6m CONTINUING tight cost controls and the contribution from acquisitions helped Johnston Press increase interim pre-tax profits by 24 per cent to Pounds 6.02m in a difficult market. The increase from the previous Pounds 4.85m was achieved on sales up 23 per cent to Pounds 41.5m (Pounds 33.7m) in the six months to June 30. The Edinburgh-based newspaper publishing group is raising the interim dividend by 0.25p to 2.5p on earnings per share of 12.9p (11.6p). The share price added 5p yesterday to 578p. Mr Fred Johnston, executive chairman, said that in the newspaper publishing division, TR Beckett recorded an encouraging performance in its first full half-year within the group. The West Sussex County Times achieved a significant profits increase, aided by the Worthing Guardian, acquired at the end of 1992. The printing market continued to suffer from recession and Wood Westworth at St Helens and Yorkshire Communication Group at Wakefield suffered losses. Both operations are under review. At the end of the half-year the cash balance had risen to Pounds 5.37m.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Vilnius, April 27 -- "The worst in the relations  between Poland and Lithuania has been left behind. We now  should show more optimism because everything that is ahead of us  will certainly be better and nicer", President Lech Walesa said  in Vilnius on Wednesday.    Appearing during a joint press conference the presidents of  Poland, Lech Walesa, and of Lithuania, Algirdas Brazauskas  stressed that the Polish-Lithuanian treaty has created  foundations for further cooperation and it will depend on  societies of the two countries how these opportunities will be  utilized.    "It seems that the treaty has in a way closed the past. Now  we are facing the tasks of construction, of the future. Poland  is prepared for this," President Walesa said.    Replying to a question asked by one of the journalists  concerning the consequences of Lithuania's stand claiming that  Vilnius and the Vilnius region had illegally belonged to Poland  in the period between the two world wars, President Brazauskas  stated:    "It is difficult to speak of any consequences after fifty  years. All the inhabitants of that area are Lithuanian citizens  and all have to respect the same laws."    Walesa confirmed that he is sceptical about the "Partnership  for Peace" programme and the plan is unsettled and dependent on  how much will be jointly done. "Poland will encourage other  countries, including Lithuania, to turn "Partnership for Peace"  into joint, big and important security for whole Europe" Walesa  said adding that there is no free Poland without free Lithuania.    Asked to comment on the Lithuanian president-voiced proposal  for a joint meeting of the Baltic states and Visegrad Group  leaders, Walesa said he is ready for such a meeting. "If  nations expect us to meet, then the meeting would be advisable.  If this is Lithuania's wish, I will prompt it to Visegrad  Group."    The presidents agreed that the issues of Kaliningrad  district  and transit through Poland or Lithuania have to be settled. The  Polish president emphasized that Poland and Lithuania will seek  the transit provided that it is economic, profitable and  controlled."    "Geographically, from the economic and not military point of  view Kaliningrad is a very good location. We have not heard  that Poland or Lithuania are willing to invade Russia. From  what we hear, but in a little bit silent way, Russia is not  going to invade Poland or Lithuania, either. One has to turn  the tanks and other hardware into ploughshares. Then transit  will be profitable for all," Walesa said.    Brazauskas told newsmen that Russia should not complain  about  transit through his country as it is conducted in compliance  with international standards.</p>

			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / Survey of Zambia (11): A secret too well kept - While its minister is optimistic for the future, tourism lacks lustre WITH attractions that range from the sandy beaches of Lake Tanganyika to the Luangwa game parks, the Victoria Falls, Lake Kariba and the magnificent Zambezi River, tourism in Zambia should be booming. In fact, the potential has barely been tapped. Private sector initiative was stifled during the Kaunda era, state-run hotels were inefficient, the infrastucture deteriorated as the economy declined and many would-be visitors were put off by the wars in the region. Meanwhile poaching flourished, often with the assistance of senior government officials. Overcoming this legacy will be a demanding task. The sector needs substantial investment at a time when government resources are scarce. The expansion of hotel capacity and allocation of new hunting concessions and sites for new game lodges needs careful planning. The expected growth in the numbers of private safari operators needs supervision. So far, there is little evidence that the country's tourist authorities have come to grips with the challenge. One pressing problem is that of Zambia Airways, the unreliable state-owned airline now facing privatisation, which is a heavily subsidised national liability. Nor does the National Tourist Board inspire confidence: its drab office off Lusaka's Cairo Road, display windows bare but for fading posters, offers a useful glossy brochure but no more. Visitors are directed to travel agents, many of whom seem better informed about holiday packages in London than expeditions to the Luangwa Valley, which offers some of the best game viewing in Africa. The poor local presentation of what Zambia has to offer may not affect the visitor arriving on a package trip sold to them by their local agents but it is a striking contrast with the energetic way in which Kenya, Zimbabwe and South Africa are competing in the tourist market. Since the Victoria Falls, Kariba and the Zambezi river are shared with Zimbabwe, the competition is especially tough. But if optimism is the main ingredient of a successful revamp of the sector, Mr Christian Tembo, the former army general who holds the tourism portfolio, is the man for the job. Visitors will double by the end of 1995 to from current levels to just under 400,000, forecasts Mr Tembo, and foreign exchange earnings will top Dollars 115m. The devaluation of the kwacha, Zambia's more favourable international image as a multi-party democracy, vigorous marketing abroad and lifting restrictions on South African passport holders will all help to meet this target, says the minister. Existing hotels operate well below capacity - the national average for room occupation is around 50 per cent. Meanwhile Mr Tembo anticipates that both quality and capacity will rise: there have been over 80 applications from abroad (over half from South Africa) to take over and upgrade existing hotels or build new ones. Incentives for investors are generous, notes the minister, and include a tax free period of up to seven years. Business travel guide Few countries in Africa can match the warmth of Zambia's welcome to the visitor. But be prepared for frustrations - years of economic decline have taken a heavy toll: hotels need refurbishing, car hire fleets need replacing, taxis are on their last set of bald tyres, the telephone service can be erratic. Lusaka is the capital and seat of government, but the industrial hub is the Copperbelt towns of Ndola and Kitwe. Zambia Airways has daily flights to the Copperbelt but many businessmen prefer a private operator, Roan Air. For a short break from Lusaka, try Lilayi Lodge (Lusaka 228682/3), a cluster of thatched rondavels with swimming pool and situated at the heart of a private game reserve, 30 minutes' drive from Lusaka. An hour away is Lechwe Lodge (Lusaka 222083/4), on the banks of the Kafue River, set in 2,000 acres of private game ranch. Zintu, at the Ridgeway Hotel, has an excellent range of traditional and modern Zambian handicrafts and the Mpapa gallery art gallery is worth visiting.

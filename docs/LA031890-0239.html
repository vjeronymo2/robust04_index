But Savage's throw to first was wide, and Rodriguez was  safe on the error.  </P> <P> Saddleback went on to commit nine more errors. The 10 errors, all by  infielders, led to 11 unearned Fullerton runs.  </P> <P> Fullerton didn't get its first earned run until Jim Short hit a home run over  the left-field fence to put the Hornets ahead, 11-1, in the seventh inning.  </P> <P> In the first inning, Fullerton scored five unearned runs. After Rodriguez  reached base on an error, Willy Speakman singled. Gary Mota hit into a force  play, but Saddleback shortstop Rob Nye's relay to first base was wild and  Rodriguez scored. Tom Wilson had an RBI double, Jim Vlcek and Kevin Monson  added RBI singles, and Fullerton scored another run on a throwing error by  catcher Ralph Grajeda.  </P> <P> Fullerton turned the 5-0 lead over to starter Steve Trachsel, a sophomore  right-hander. He allowed five hits, striking out four and walking two in seven  innings to improve to 6-1. Brian Behnke pitched the final two innings.  </P> <P> Ted Savage had two hits, including an RBI double, for Saddleback (7-10, 2-6).  Saddleback's Eric Cedarstaff (0-6) lasted two-thirds of an inning, allowing  five unearned runs.  </P> <P> In other Orange Empire Conference games:  </P> <P> Rancho Santiago 12, Cypress 11 -- Tom Acuna hit a two-run home run in the ninth  inning to pull Cypress within 12-11, but Matt Lackie came in to get the final  out for host Rancho Santiago (15-5, 6-3). Acuna had two home runs and five  RBIs.  </P> <P> Chris Floth, Greg Martineau, Steve Grack and Marty Neff hit home runs for  Rancho Santiago. Neff's homer was his conference-leading 11th and Grack hit his  seventh. It was Martineau's second and Floth's first.

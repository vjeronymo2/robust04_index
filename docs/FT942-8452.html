			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / Arts: Today's Television There is a treat in store for those with nearly four hours to spare: starting at 6.55 Radio 3 is relaying Carmen from Covent Garden with Placido Domingo in the role of Don Jose for the first time at the Royal Opera House for more than 20 years. The title role is taken by American soprano Denyce Graves and Barseg Tumanyan sings the toreador Escamillo. In his seminal work, 'The Complete Opera Book', Gustave Kobbe states that the character of Carmen 'is, of course, the creation of the novelist' Merimee. But tonight in an interval talk between Acts 1 and 2, Tony Briggs suggests that the true model for Bizet's gypsy heroine was Pushkin's Zemfira. If opera is not to your taste there is a mass of other music on radio to choose from. At 8.00 the Classic FM Evening Concert consists of early music including the oratorio 'San Giovanni Battista' by the mysterious Italian composer Alessandro Stradella, conducted by Marc Minkowski. Or how about highlights from the recent European Brass Band Championships in Montreux, which can be heard in Listen To The Band (9.00 Radio 2).</p>

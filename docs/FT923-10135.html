			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / International Company News: Political shadow over KIO assets offer - The background to Javier de la Rosa's Dollars 2.5bn bid for Grupo Torras For 12 long days this month the Kuwait Investment Office (KIO) sat on an offer worth Dollars 2.5bn for all of its Spanish industrial assets from a former investment partner in Spain, Mr Javier de la Rosa. On Wednesday July 22, a trusted but now middle-ranking KIO official, called Mr de la Rosa to ask him for a 'confirmatory copy' and to query points in the offer, which he had faxed to the Kuwaiti finance minister on July 15. The official said they wanted him to countersign the original fax. Although irritated by the fact that he had not been approached by a more senior official, Mr de la Rosa signed and sent a new fax, but it apparently never arrived at the headquarters of the KIO's Spanish holding company, Grupo Torras, in Madrid. Mr de la Rosa did not respond to further calls from the official on the Thursday and Friday of last week. Last Monday the bank standing by to guarantee the offer said it could no longer wait and he sent another fax to Kuwait withdrawing the offer. Yesterday in Madrid, however, KIO representatives told the El Pais newspaper the Torras companies were in serious trouble and required Dollars 3bn to put them on a sound financial footing. Creditor banks are being called to a meeting on August 5 to discuss a debt moratorium which would help Prima, the Torras property arm, avoid capital repayments on Dollars 700m of debt for eight months. This has been almost inevitable. By forcing the Torras chemicals arm, Ercros, to file for protection from creditors - with debts of Dollars 2.15bn  -earlier this month following a refusal to finance it, the management which took over at the KIO in May may have triggered a crisis of confidence in all its companies. Prima stock has fallen from Pta2,500 (Dollars 26.5) to Pta950 in a month. But the rest of the Torras companies bought and built up by Mr de la Rosa and KIO's former managers are also suffering. Stock in Ebro, a big foods group, is weak and Torraspapel, Spain's biggest paper company, is finding it hard to raise new credit. At the same time, the new KIO management has ordered Torras' auditors, Coopers &amp; Lybrand, to prepare accounts for 1991 removing all extraordinary profits and valuing its portfolio at current stock market prices, not at book value. This slashes a modest Dollars 3m profit reported by the company to a loss of Dollars 300m. Ironically the Kuwaiti government still accounts for its worldwide holdings on the same book value method employed by the old KIO managers. But if the companies are in such trouble, why did the KIO not immediately test the seriousness of Mr de la Rosa's offer and begin negotiations. He had worked closely with KIO's old management for six years and managed direct investment in Spain by KIO of Dollars 3.7bn. So why provoke him by asking to check his signature? Why did a senior KIO official not call him? The KIO might fairly be said to have thought the 10-day initial response time contained in the negotiating offer was flexible. Also, the KIO is still valuing its Spanish portfolio. But for the KIO to appear in the Spanish press yesterday running down the quality of its investments and stating that some, such as Prima, are on the verge of collapse is an unusual way of generating confidence. Part of the explanation is mired in the village politics of Kuwait, where elections are to be held in October. The old KIO management, with whom Mr de la Rosa is closely identified and still friendly, was a creation of the ruling Al-Sabah family. Since the end of the Gulf war, the Al-Sabahs have been forced to bend to demands from rich Kuwaiti merchant families for more power and KIO's new management reflects a shift of resources to the merchants. Grupo Torras probably does not need Dollars 3bn to survive but the blacker the empire created by the old pro-Sabah management is painted and the bigger the crisis in Spain appears, the more effective a political weapon Torras may become in the run up to the elections. That is one view. The other is that the KIO's new management have indeed found themselves in a mess in Spain, with big debts, loans pegged to equity stakes in its companies and a rapidly shrinking economy which calls for desperate measures. But if this is the case, the obvious question again raises its head. Why was Mr de la Rosa's Dollars 2.5bn offer not then acted upon with urgency? Mr de la Rosa, according to people close to him, is almost certain to make a new bid for Torras, probably in August. He is understood to have two major industrial partners, from the UK and Germany, interested in entering the Spanish market in sectors occupied by Torras companies. Extremely well connected, he is quite capable of raising the money though, following the crisis leaks to El Pais yesterday, a new bid is likely to be lower than the first.</p>

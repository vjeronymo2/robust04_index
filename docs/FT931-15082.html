			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses cautious ahead of US air strike NEWS that President George Bush had decided to launch a military strike on Iraq came towards the close of trading on the continent, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT came under pressure from the tension between Iraq and the US and the slowdown in the German economy. The DAX index fell 13.69 to 1,516.50 as turnover rose from DM4.2bn to DM4.3bn. Volkswagen closed DM4.40 lower at DM258.50 before the outcome of yesterday's extraordinary board meeting on job cuts and lower investments. Siemens eased DM4.80 to DM573 ahead of today's report on the first quarter of 1992/93. Kugelfisher, the ball-bearing manufacturer, fell DM10.50 or 11.6 per cent to DM80 on news that it would make losses in 1992 and 1993. Hoesch Umtausch, representing the merger swap into Krupp AG, dropped DM10 to DM110, against DM210 three months ago. PARIS was weighed down by LVMH which fell as much as 7 per cent on its return to trading after its suspension on Tuesday. LVMH's report on 1992 earnings prompted several brokers to downgrade their forecasts for 1993. The CAC-40 index ended 14.23 lower at 1,782.53 in turnover of FFr2.4bn. LVMH ended FFr161 or 4.7 per cent lower at FFr3,260 and its affiliated companies also weakened. Other fallers included Pechiney CIs which dropped FFr15 or 4.8 per cent to FFr295 following poor results from Alcoa, the US aluminium company, and the insurer UAP, down FFr16.70 to FFr476.30 on fears that it was exposed to the Braer oil spill off Shetland. AMSTERDAM finished unchanged with Royal Dutch recouping some of its losses in the last minutes of trading on expectations of higher oil prices in the event of renewed conflict in the Gulf. The CBS Tendency index was flat at 96.4. Royal Dutch was down 70 cents at Fl 146.40 but above a low of Fl 145.60. Begemann, the industrial group, fell Fl 7.50 or 9 per cent to Fl 72.50 after reporting lower 1992 earnings. Polygram rose 40 cents rise to Fl 43.70 after it said that it had increased its stake in two Japanese record companies. Philips slipped 30 cents to Fl 20.50. MILAN rose as Generali extended its recent gains. The market was also lifted by hopes that on Friday the government will announce tax incentives to stimulate investment in the stock market. The Comit index rose 7.74 to 458.85 in turnover estimated at close to Tuesday's L234.6bn. Generali was fixed L800 higher at L30,800 before reaching L31,300 later. Credito Italiano added L43 to L3,160. ZURICH stayed faithful to the financial sector, UBS bearers rising SFr11 to SFr886, CS Holding by SFr50 to SFr2,050 and Winterthur registered by SFr70 to SFr2,790. The SMI index fell 4.3 to 2,074.9. Recent high-flyers in the pharmaceutical sector suffered from light profit-taking. Some attention moved to second-tier shares where Sulzer rose SFr11 to SFr605. MADRID's general index rose 0.95 to 220.06 as Banco Popular supported the financial sector on solid 1992 earnings and rose Pta150 to Pta11,900. Viscofan, a manufacturer of sausage skin, gained Pta70 or 6.4 per cent to Pta1,160 on news that a US competitor had filed for Chapter 11. STOCKHOLM closed lower as afternoon selling wiped out early gains. The Affarsvarlden General index fell 4.70 to 930.50 as turnover improved to SKr875m from SKr708m. Astra fell on reports that it might have to cut prices on several of its products. The A share fell SKr8 to SKr707. OSLO wiped out Tuesday's strong gains, due to falls in Norsk Hydro and Hafslund. The all-share index eased 5.0 to 387.0 in light turnover of NKr231m. Hafslund's B-shares lost NKr3.5 to NKr161 while Norsk Hydro closed down NKr2.5 at NKr163. BRUSSELS's Bel-20 index inched 3.02 higher to 1,149.03 points. The pharmaceutical group UCB climbed BFr500 to BFr23,900 while Petrofina fell for the third day, down BFr50 to BFr7,370. DUBLIN continued to chip away at the 5.6 per cent gain it registered in the first three trading days of 1993. The Iseq index fell another 18.95 to 1,259.25, down from 1,295.77 a week ago. Davy Stockbrokers said at a presentation in London that the Irish cabinet could decide to devalue the punt within two or three weeks, offering scope for a post-devaluation rally of 10-15 per cent. Davy like banks, noting that AIB has declined by 3 per cent over the past 12 months, and Bank of Ireland appreciated by just 13 per cent against gains of 39 per cent by UK banks and 49 per cent for their US regional counterparts. ISTANBUL's 75-share index fell 101.14 or 2.4 per cent at 4,044.42 in turnover of TL250bn. TEL AVIV fell for the third day on profit-taking by private investors after last week's gains.

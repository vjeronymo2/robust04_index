			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / Minding Your Own Business: Mr 5 per cent between China and the world - Shaul Eisenberg, the secretive billionaire and middleman, invites Tony Walker on to his private jet for a glimpse of wheeling and dealing SHAUL Eisenberg, the reclusive Israeli billionaire and possibly the world's greatest middleman, is holding forth in his private jet high above the neat, patchwork fields of the Chinese countryside. 'Never show off, be humble,' he advises. 'And if you become big, be even more humble.' Asked the secret of making money, he is characteristically to the point: 'A good supplier and a good buyer, and remember the buyer is always king.' So it is that Eisenberg, at 72 and with one heart by-pass operation behind him, travels the world in his private Boeing 727, stitching up deals, stroking foreign potentates, and accumulating vast sums of money. He is not prepared to say just how wealthy he is beyond referring to the latest Fortune survey of the world's billionaires which estimates his net worth at Dollars 1.3bn; in the same company as the Dassault's of Mirage aircraft fame, William Hewlett of Hewlett Packard and Kanichiro Ishibashi of Bridgestone tires. By most standards Eisenberg, a heavy-set man with a lugubrious manner, has made it; and yet he remains a mysterious figure operating in the nether world of behind-the-scenes wheeling and dealing, shielded from public view by a coterie of Israeli assistants. China, in its explosive new economic phase, is his domain. He rarely talks to the media and when he does he has proved extremely guarded about his business interests, his family and his past. This has invited all manner of speculation and the odd unfavourable notice such as a 1987 article in Forbes which said: 'his story reads like The Merchant of Venice bizarrely grafted on to TV's Dallas, then transmogrified into some Far Eastern potboiler by James Clavell.' Mention of the Forbes article with its accusations that he has not always been scrupulous in dealings with Asian leaders pains Eisenberg who dismisses the piece as 'anti-semitic', and adds: 'To think it was written by a Jew.' Eisenberg's motives in talking to the Financial Times, and inviting its correspondent to travel on his jet are not altogether clear. It may have something to do with a successful man's desire to tell his story in the twilight of his career. It may also derive from a calculation that a more public stance, now that Israel and China have normalised relations, will help his business interests in China. These include direct investments in glass-making in Shanghai, a computer disc-drive venture in Harbin, and a proposed potash plant in far-west Qinghai province. These investments mark a switch in strategy from '5 per cent middleman' supplying equipment to investor in projects in his own right. Eisenberg's Panama-registered United Development Incorporated is also one of the biggest foreign traders in China, dealing in everything from pig-iron and power plants to Disney comics. Eisenberg likes to say that in these straitened times in China - credit is being squeezed across the board - he has found a way to finance deals which give him an edge over competitors. But he is cagy about details. 'It is my patent,' he says of financing arrangements which rely heavily on his skills as a barter trader. Seated in his converted jet surrounded by his lieutenants, including a retired brigadier-general of the Israeli Air Force, Eisenberg is en route from Beijing to Nanjing, the capital of Jiangsu province, where he is to be a guest of the governor, rather like a state visit. Eisenberg's business style, learned from the Japanese in the post-war era, relies on cultivating friends in high places in country's such as South Korea and Taiwan which were the focus of his deal-making in the years before he targeted China in the late 1970s. 'I do only business with friends. If they are not friends I don't do business,' Eisenberg likes to say. Among his more valuable 'selling tools' is a well-thumbed photograph album which shows him pictured with various Chinese leaders, including State President Jiang Zemin when the latter was a relatively lowly official. Eisenberg's jet lands in steamy Nanjing and is met on the tarmac by a senior provincial official. Eisenberg is swept away in a black stretch limousine preceded by police cars with flashing lights and sirens. His staff, all Israeli, apart from Filippino and Chinese secretaries, follows in a mini-bus. At a lavish welcoming banquet which features hedgehog soup and glutinous dumplings, toasts are drunk to successful billion-dollar joint projects, including a bridge over the Yangtze and a toll-highway from Nanjing to Shanghai. And so Eisenberg continues around China - from Nanjing to Nanning, capital of Guangxi, to Shanghai, and on to Jinan, capital of Shandong before returning to Beijing. It is an exhausting schedule in mid-summer in some of China's hottest regions and begs the question: why would a man of Eisenberg's age and wealth bother? 'I like to cook (deals),' he says. 'In any case, if I stop I would die]' It was ever thus, it seems. The story of German-born Eisenberg's escape from Nazi Germany to Shanghai by way of the Netherlands with just 20 Guilders in his pocket reveals an early penchant for deal-making, and was a pointer to his later vocation as a middleman. Two weeks after he boarded the ship, the Netherlands fell to the Germans and the Guilder became worthless. Good fortune smiled, however. Eisenberg discovered that the purser would not dirty his hands dealing directly with a hold full of Chinese seaman who had been rescued from a sunken vessel, so he became a go-between trading cigarettes and spirits. By the end of the voyage he had accumulated Dollars 500, a considerable sum in those days. Eisenberg joined his parents in Shanghai where his father had established himself as a vegetable oil seller. The young Eisenberg then ventured to Japan. There he sold Chinese carpets during the war to wealthy Japanese and, after, to the US army, before moving on to deal in iron ore and scrap in the post-war period, learning from the Japanese business samurai in the process. 'I was friendly with Mitsui (Japanese trading company),' he recalls. 'I learned a lot from them. They're good business people. They said they might have lost the war, but they wanted to win the economic war, and they planned it properly - like a war. In those days, there were a lot of military people in Japanese companies.' Eisenberg himself has followed this formula. UDI is peppered with military types. He likes military-style efficiency . . . and people who are prepared to work long hours without complaining. A quick staff turnover is one of the features of the Eisenberg organisation. Former employees, while they respect his prodigious energy and deal-making skills, are less complimentary about his abilities as a manager. 'He expects 200 per cent from his employees, and he meddles in everything,' said one. 'We used to joke that if we wanted to change the colour of the toilet paper from white to pink Mr Eisenberg would get involved in the decision. The problem is that he doesn't trust anybody.' A more serious observation is that UDI is virtually a 'one man show' and that when Eisenberg passes from the scene the company will disappear with him. 'The Eisenberg group of companies could have been a real empire, but it is a one man show,' said a former UDI manager. UDI's China business has come a long way since Eisenberg arrived in Peking on Christmas eve, 1978, to explore opportunities in a country cautiously opening to the outside world. Today, he has more than a dozen offices around China, 150 employees, and a billion-dollar trading turnover which includes a large barter business. Eisenberg directs operations from a plush suite of offices on the 35th floor of Beijing's China World Tower. He shouts orders from his office to assistants who drift in and out to report progress on deals. This is not the hush-hush world of high corporate endeavour, but a trading post juggling a thousand and one business opportunities. Of his sometimes fractious relations with his staff, Eisenberg says: 'Let's say I'm a tough character, but I'm only tough if I see someone making mistakes. I don't like mistakes. If they make mistakes they have to be told, or even thrown out.' On one issue, Eisenberg is particularly sensitive, and that is the question of Israeli arms sales to China. 'People think I am an arms dealer,' he says. 'But I only did it for Israel. I hate the military business, and I don't do it in other countries. In any case, it's only small business between China and Israel. We did not give them hardwear, only know-how.' Independent sources say the relationship was more extensive, possibly running into hundreds of millions of dollars in the past decade. According to a Rand Corporation study in 1991, Israel has helped China develop a surface-to-air missile, an intermediate-range missile, an air-to-air missile, advanced armour technology for tanks and an airborne early warning system, among other items. While, Eisenberg spends more than half his time roaming the world, 'cooking' deals his home base has been firmly in Israel since the mid 1970s when the Israeli Knesset, passed what became known as the 'Eisenberg law'. This was drafted with Eisenberg in mind to allow Israeli tycoons to operate from Israel without having to pay local tax on their worldwide earnings. Israeli press reports indicate that life within the Eisenberg family - one son, five daughters and 19 grandchildren - has been fairly turbulent with the autocratic patriarch skirmishing with sons-in-law, who had been drawn into and then abruptly left the family business. Relations with 42-year-old son Erwin have been tense on occasions. Eisenberg deflects questions about his household, but he does volunteer that at time he has given Erwin a 'hard time,' because 'I don't believe in spoiling your kids.' Eisenberg's reputation in his own country is that of a fairly ruthless wheeler-dealer. A case in point was his intervention 18 months ago when the struggling Israeli aircraft industry planned to sell the Kfir copy of the Mirage to Taiwan - a deal which could have hurt his business activities in China. 'I intervened very strongly,' he said. 'Taiwan is not a threat to Israel as China is.' He would not have blamed Beijing, he said, if it had carried out a threat, conveyed privately, to supply arms to Syria for nothing, if the Kfir deal had gone ahead. Eisenberg's connections brings some strange business propositions. He was recently approached by North Korea with a proposal that Israel provide Dollars 200m to develop a gold-mine. In return Pyongyang's would undertake not to supply nuclear technology to Iran or arms to Syria. Eisenberg dismisses the proposal as 'blackmail,' but sensing there may be opportunities in North Korea, which cannot remain closed forever, has begun, tentatively, to do business there, placing an order for textiles. Wherever he is in the world Eisenberg keeps in touch with his various businesses which include an aeroplane leasing company in the US and a trading house in South Africa. 'I know every week how much money we make and how much we spend,' he says. 'Before I go home for the weekend I want to know if I'm broke or if I am rich. So where does Eisenberg, at an age when most tycoons have quietly retired to the golf course or to their country estates, go from here? Apart from China he has established a presence in central Asia and in the Russian Federation, although experience has taught him to be wary of those markets. He is also focusing attention on India which is undergoing a process of privatisation. What of his ultimate goal in these twilight years? 'I would like to think that one day I could do business with the Arabs,' he says reflectively.</p>

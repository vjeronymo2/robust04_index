			<p>BFN     [Text] Bolivian businessmen have blocked the aspirations of  the government and Chilean private business by deciding that a  free trade zone with Chile is not viable and that trade  relations should continue within the framework of the Economic  Complementation Agreement (ACE) signed by the two countries last  year.    This decision was made after a serious and profound  evaluation of the disadvantages national exporters are facing in  introducing their products in the Chilean market. The most  difficult problems to overcome are the price list brackets  established by Chile that restrict the access of exportable  Bolivian products to the Chilean market.    On 13 May, National Industrial Association President Gary  Lacunza said the talks held with Chilean businesses in an  environment of agreement established that it is impossible to  join a free trade zone.    The results of the third meeting of the Economic  Complementation Agreement's Business Advisory Committee (Case),  held in Santiago, Chile, on 9 and 10 May indicate that despite  the growth of bilateral trade between Bolivia and Chile, the  Bolivian trade deficit tends to grow.    The issues discussed in the meeting included the low  exploitation of the Chilean market due to the reduced number of  exportable Bolivian products, the lack of potentially exportable  Bolivian products on the agreement list, and the lack of road  infrastructure, which increases the cost of exportable Bolivian  products.    The main point of discussion was centered, however, on the  Bolivian proposal to suspend the price list bracket imposed by  Chile on Bolivian products, which is the biggest restriction on  Bolivia's access to that market. There was no answer from Chile  on that proposal.    In its final conclusion, the Case recognized that the lack  of  adequate trade channels and the tax policy that distorts formal  trade are the main reasons why little advantage is taken of the  ACE tariff preferences.    The Case made a series of recommendations to balance the  Chilean-Bolivian trade balance. The recommendations include the  improvement of the procedures for issuing certificates of origin  in order to unify the criteria to have the certificates issued  under the terms of a single regulation. This measure also will  prevent tariff preferences from benefiting countries that are  not members of the agreement.    Regarding the Draft Agreement on Reciprocal Protection and  Promotion, the agreement recommends that the draft be signed as  soon as possible.    Regarding double taxation in the two countries on exportable  products, a decision was made to sign an agreement similar to  other agreements. For this purpose, the Chilean side presented  the agreement signed with Argentina on this issue.    A recommendation also was made that the Animal and Plant  Health Cooperation Agreement be signed as soon as possible.    Regarding the difference between the amount of Chilean  exports and the amount of Bolivian imports, which shows a trade  of $70 million through smuggling, the Case recommended the  signing of a cooperation agreement between customs agencies in  the two countries.    The evaluation made by the Case also refers to collateral  issues to the agreement's development such as the case of  pharmaceutical products, which must not be included in the ACE  list.    The Case also calls for the elimination of consular visas in  order to make bilateral relations easier and more flexible, and  for the incorporation of air transportation in the agreement.    The Case also noted the need for the Management Commission  to  answer the proposals made in the third meeting within 30 days,  starting on the day the recommendations were made.    Lacunza also reported that in the next few days a study will  begin on the proposals the private sector will submit to the  government to get the government to meet the conditions demanded  for the growth of the productive sector with the resulting  benefit for the country's general economic activity.</p>

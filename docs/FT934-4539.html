			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / Lilley may allow cut in retirement benefits Employers could be allowed to provide lower pension benefits than those guaranteed in the state earnings related pension scheme under proposals to be set out for consultation by the government today. A paper outlining alternatives to the state guaranteed minimum pension, the portion of an occupational pension which must rise with inflation, is to be published today by Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary. The paper, intended as a discussion document, asks for comment from the pensions industry by January 14. The paper - publication of which was widely expected as soon as the equalisation of state pension ages was announced - asks how to minimise burdens on business and taxpayers while safeguarding individuals' rights. The government has suggested that while it is likely to increase the regulation of occupational pension schemes, it would like to balance that by reducing some of the administrative burdens it now imposes on employers. The paper appears to favour a suggestion that benefits which employers must provide under GMP need no longer be equal to those promised under the state earnings related pension scheme. Occupational schemes whose members contract out of Serps receive national insurance contribution rebates to provide GMP, thus reducing the government's need to provide more expensive Serps benefits in the future. For many scheme members GMP has been the sole guarantee that at least a portion of their pension will rise with inflation. Instead of this complicated system, the paper suggests, the administrative burden on employers could be reduced by adopting a 'quality test' based on certification by an actuary that the standard contribution rate was calculated to be enough to provide the minimum benefit. While the paper says the option is simply one of many, it lists several advantages and relatively few disadvantages. To guarantee that adequate minimum benefits are paid - both to protect scheme members and to ensure the government receives value for the contributions it makes to private employers' schemes - the government would have to stipulate how that calculation was made. This option could offer significant administrative cost savings for schemes, although to avoid damaging scheme members during a transitional period it could force employers to provide more generous benefits than they would have been required to under GMP.</p>

			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Boots Boots is still struggling to clarify its strategy. After 16 months, the group has yet to reveal the conclusions of its review of the drug division. Nor has it announced the promised acquisition to bolster its European non-prescription medicines business. The group intimated yesterday that a deal for the drugs division was imminent. Boots' biggest dilemma will then be what to do with the cash. The disposal, expected to raise more than Pounds 700m, will heavily dilute earnings because of the drug operation's high margins. Boots could compensate by using the sale proceeds to buy back shares. The management has said it has no hang-ups about returning money to shareholders. Such a move would also, in some way, atone for the disastrous Pounds 900m purchase of Ward White. Any non-prescription medicine acquisition could subsequently be funded by debt. Boots is undergeared given the strength of its cash flow. Such manoeuvres would considerably reduce uncertainty, but whether they would lead to the stock's re-rating is doubtful. Boots the Chemist is struggling effectively in a difficult market. But in a low inflation environment, sales growth is likely to be sound rather than exciting and earnings expansion will require hard graft. Such prospects justify its small premium to the market, but little more.</p>

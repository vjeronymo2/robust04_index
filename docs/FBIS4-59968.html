			<p>BFN     [Text] U.S. Secretary of State Christopher and his  accompanying delegation left Damascus at 1615 yesterday. He was  seen off at Damascus International Airport by Foreign Minister  Faruq al-Shar', the Syrian ambassador in Washington, and the  U.S. ambassador in Damascus.    The U.S. secretary of state arrived in Cairo yesterday,  Wednesday, evening. He met with Egyptian President Husni  Mubarak. Christopher said he believes that Syria is serious  about Middle East peace.    Following his meeting with President Mubarak, Christopher  told reporters that the negotiations are facing a long road, and  that the issues are remarkably difficult.    In press statements on his arrival in Cairo, Christopher  said  he held good and constructive talks with officials in Syria and  Israel. He explained that during his meetings several proposals  were discussed. These proposals concern achieving a  breakthrough in the peace process on the Syrian track.  Christopher expressed optimism despite the existence of some  difficult topics that need further talks with both sides. He  said he naturally found points of convergence and difference.  However, we will continue the rounds of talks to reach a  solution and achieve a breakthrough on all tracks, he added.</p>

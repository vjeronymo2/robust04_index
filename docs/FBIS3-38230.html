Kwasniewski insisted that "the government's priority is the  development of the economy and the growth of gross domestic  product. The main elements of reform are to be, and must be,  continued. There is no other road for our country to reach  democracy, the market economy and an integrated Europe."    He described the September 1993 election victory by leftist  parties as proof of the maturity of the Polish political system,  and not as a rejection of the process of reform. However, the  result showed that personal hopes and expectations were also  important.    Kwasniewski stressed that the government was seeking to  maintain a very disciplined budgetary policy. He hoped that it  might be possible to increase pensions and other social  programmes, but only when the state had first earned the  financial resources for those aims. At the moment, however, it  was impossible to fund all such programmes, he said.</p>

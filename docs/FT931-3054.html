			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget (Analysis): Abolition closes loophole - BES Loans THE ABOLITION of Business Expansion Schemes involving loans finishes a spending spree which raised Pounds 568m since last September, when the loophole was first discov-ered. This went towards transferring repossessed housing held by lenders such as banks and building societies to assured tenancies. The loophole closed by the chancellor allowed companies to make non-recourse loans to investors in BES companies six months after original investment, with only the value of the BES shares themselves as security. The original intention of the act was that tax relief would be forfeited if the shares were disposed of within five years. By offering non-recourse loans after six months of 75p for every Pounds 1 invested, banks and building societies gained very cheap finance while allowing an excessive return to top-rate taxpayers, who had effectively only invested 60p for every Pounds 1 received by the building societies. Mr Lamont's description of the schemes as 'highly subsidised loans for top rate taxpayers' therefore seems accurate. Basic rate taxpayers could not benefit from the schemes. Mr Tim Villiers, chairman of the BES Association, described the move as disappointing, but admitted that the schemes had been 'pure arbitrage of the taxman'.</p>

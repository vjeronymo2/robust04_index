			<p>BFN     [Text] The Seimas [word indistinct] has presented the  government with a statement of no confidence against the cabinet  led by Prime Minister Adolfas Slezevicius. The statement was  initiated earlier by the Social Democrats. After receiving an  official reply, required within 14 days by the government, the  parliament has five more days to open Seimas discussions. More  than 50 percent of the parliamentary votes are needed to pass a  vote of no confidence against the cabinet.</p>

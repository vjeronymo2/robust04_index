			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / Frenchman to become chairman of Euro Disney MR Robert Fitzpatrick yesterday resigned as chairman of Euro Disney, which has faced speculation about its performance since the opening of the FFr4.2bn (Pounds 510m) EuroDisneyland theme park outside Paris last April. He will be succeeded by Mr Philippe Bourguignon, 42, a Frenchman who orchestrated the development of hotels and property around the park. He joined Euro Disney in 1988 from Accor, one of France's largest hotel and leisure companies. The news was greeted by a jump in Euro Disney's share price. The shares closed 28p higher at 778p in London and FFr2 higher at FFr66 in Paris. Euro Disney denied that the departure of Mr Fitzpatrick, 52, was related to reports that the park was failing to meet its targets for attendance and merchandise sales. It said Mr Fitzpatrick wanted to hand over to an indigenous European management team, having completed the park's launch. There had been speculation about his future at Euro Disney since September when he ceded part of his responsibilities by making Mr Bourguignon president in his place and becoming chairman. Mr Fitzpatrick plans to set up a consultancy in Paris but will remain on Euro Disney's management board. Mr Fitzpatrick formerly worked for Walt Disney, the US leisure and entertainment group that owns 49 per cent of Euro Disney. He became president of the European company in 1987. EuroDisneyland was originally expected to attract 11m visitors in its first year. Euro Disney has refused to disclose specific figures but recently confirmed that the park, which was visited by 7m people in its first six months, would probably fall about 500,000 below target for attendance in its first full year. Merchandise sales, and occupancy levels at EuroDisneyland's five hotels, have also fallen below expectations. London stocks, Page 13 World stocks, Page 19</p>

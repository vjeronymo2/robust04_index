			<p><P> November 22, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> ACTRESS IS 'QUEEN OF ANONYMITY'  </P> <P> Isabella Hofmann says although millions of people watch her every week on the  NBC comedy "Dear John," she is the "Queen of Anonymity" when she walks down the  street.  </P> <P> The actress, who plays Kate McCarron on the show about a singles' support  group, says in TV Guide that she never gets stared at or stopped for  autographs.  </P> <P> To illustrate, she described a recent lunch with her manager in a trendy Los  Angeles restaurant. The waitress said the restaurant owner wanted to send her a  dessert on the house. Hofmann said she could not figure out why.  </P> <P> "My manager said, 'Now Isabella, please. You're in a hit show, and people just  do this sort of thing.' And I said, 'No, you know how it is with me. No one  ever recognizes me. Something's wrong, you watch.' . . . Then the owner came  over and said, 'Oh, I'm sorry. The waitress had the wrong table.' "  </P></p>

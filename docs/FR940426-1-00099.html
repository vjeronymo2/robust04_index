			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Therefore, the Ozone Transport Commission determines that a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regional LEV program, the OTC LEV program, is necessary to bring  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Ozone Transport Region into attainment by the dates provided  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the Clean Air Act; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Furthermore, that by majority vote of the States of the Ozone  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Transport Commission, as indicated by the attached signature  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sheet, the Ozone Transport Commission transmits the attached  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> strategy recommendation regarding the OTC LEV program to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Furthermore that adoption of this recommendation by the Ozone  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Transport Commission or approval of this recommendation by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> U.S. Environmental Protection Agency will not require the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adoption of California reformulated gasoline standards by any X  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> within the OTR; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Furthermore that as a part of this submittal, the Ozone Transport  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commission includes the attached Response to Comments received  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> during the public's opportunity to comment on this matter, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the attached Technical Support Document which addresses the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements of Section 184(d) of the Clean Air Act; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Furthermore that the Ozone Transport Commission will participate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fully in the consultation process on this recommendation with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> U.S. Environmental Protection Agency as provided in Section 1184(c)(3) of the Clean Air Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> Text of February 1, 1994, Recommendation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the Ozone Transport Commission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The Ozone Transport Commission (OTC) has developed the following  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recommendation for an Ozone Transport Commission Low Emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Vehicle (OTC LEV) program which is to be submitted to the U.S.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Environmental Protection Agency under Section 184(c) of the Clean  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Air Act (CAA). The legal authority for the OTC recommendation is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> described under Section 184(c)(1) of the Clean Air Act and could  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> result in a Federal requirement for regionwide adoption and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enforcement of motor vehicle emission standards available under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 177 of the Clean Air Act. The recommendation is as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under Section 184(c) of the Clean Air Act as amended in 1990, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ozone Transport Commission hereby recommends adoption of an Ozone  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Transport Commission Low Emission Vehicle program including the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> elements described below for the geographic region designated as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Ozone Transport Region, defined as the States of Connecticut,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Delaware, Maine, Massachusetts, Maryland, New Hampshire, New  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Vermont, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> District of Columbia and that part of Virginia within the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Area which includes the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> District of Columbia.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Adoption of this recommendation by the Ozone Transport Commission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or the United States Environmental Protection Agency will not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> require the adoption of the California Reformulated Gasoline  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Standards by any State, Commonwealth, or jurisdiction with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ozone Transport Region.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 --> Elements of the Proposed OTC LEV Program Recommendation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to the requirements of Section 177 of the Clean Air  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Act, the Ozone Transport Commission Low Emission Vehicle (OTC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> LEV) program is applicable to all 1999 and subsequent model year  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> passenger cars and light duty trucks (0&hyph;557550 pounds loaded  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicle weight) in the Ozone Transport Region (OTR).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Emissions Requirements and Prohibition: No corporation,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> person or other entity shall sell, import, deliver, purchase,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lease, rent, acquire, receive, or register a new vehicle subject  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the OTC LEV program in the OTR that has not received a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> California ARB Executive Order, unless the vehicle is sold  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> directly from one dealer to another dealer, sold for purposes of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> being wrecked or dismantled, sold exclusively for off-highway use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or sold for registration out of the OTR, as well as a vehicle  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purchased by a nonresident prior to establishing residency or a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicle transfer by inheritance, decree of divorce, dissolution,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or legal separation. Other exceptions would include motor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicles held for daily lease or rental to the general public or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engaged in interstate commerce that are registered and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> principally operated outside the OTR and motor vehicles defined  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as test vehicles, emergency vehicles, or qualifying for exemption  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under Section 43656 of the California Health and Safety Code.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The OTC LEV program will allow five categories of vehicles:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> California Tier I Vehicles, Transitional Low Emission Vehicles  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (TLEV), Low Emission Vehicles (LEV), Ultra-Low Emission Vehicles  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ULEV) and Zero Emission Vehicles (ZEV). Manufacturers may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> choose any combination of vehicles certified to the above  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards, to meet a prescribed fleet emission average standard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the OTR.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The effective date for the OTC/state implementation of the OTC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> LEV program is January 1, 1996. This schedule allows for notice  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to manufacturers of two vehicle model years and requires sales of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cleaner vehicles for the 1999 model year. The OTC LEV program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> does not affect or preclude States from earlier implementation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This program includes a fleet non-methane organic gases  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission average as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

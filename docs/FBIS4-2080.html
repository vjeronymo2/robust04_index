			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 5 (XINHUA) -- The Democratic  People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) is making great efforts to  realize national unification and denuclearization of the Korean  Peninsula, President Kim Il-song said here today.    According to the KOREAN CENTRAL NEWS AGENCY, Kim Il-song  made  the statement at a banquet to welcome King Norodom Sihanouk of  Cambodia and Queen Norodom Mouique Sihanouk, who began an  official visit to dprk on April 4.    At the same time King Sihanouk said that the DPRK is not  responsible for the danger of war on the Korean Peninsula.    He added that the DPRK is entitled to defend itself if any  foreign forces launch an invasion.    A row has blown up recently between the International Atomic  Energy Agency (IAEA) and the DPRK over the inspection of the  latter's nuclear sites. The Vienna-based IAEA claimed that  Pyongyang rejected full inspection while the DPRK said that it  had met the IAEA's demands.    Last Thursday [31 March] the United Nations Security Council  requested, in a presidential statement, that the DPRK allow the  IAEA to complete its inspection of the nuclear facilities by  mid-May.    On Monday, South Korea decided to postpone the planned joint  military exercise between its armed forces and those of the  United States until mid-May in the hope that the DPRK would  respond positively to the U.N. Security Council's request.</p>

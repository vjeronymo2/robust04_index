			<p>BFN     [Text] Ankara, April 14 (A.A.) -- The Public Partnership  Administration (KOI), the state body for privatization, put new  state shares on sale on Thursday [14 April] to reach the  government's 1994 revenue target of 3.5 billion dollars.    The administration announced a tender for the sale of its  100  percent stake in the Petlas Tire Company, which the government  plans to close unless it is privatized.    Officials said KOI would invite offers for 12 establishments  of the textiles producer Sumer Holding on Friday and 32 concerns  of the milk and dairy products producer SEK and two hotels of  the tourism firm Turban later this month.    Officials said KOI planned to privatize 10 major companies  partly or wholly this year to achieve the target.    They are: PETKIM petrochemicals, TUPRAS oil refining firm,  petrol retailer POAS, Sumerbank, Turban Hotel and Marina chain,  Eregli Iron and Steel Firm, Turkish Airlines, oil [word  indistinct] DITAS, Turkish Maritime Company and ground-service  firm HAVAS.    A parliamentary commission adopted a draft law that would  enable the government to handle privatization by decree to  shorten the complex sell-off procedures.    The draft, to be enacted by the parliament, will also open  the way for KOI's reorganization and accumulation of sell-off  proceeds in a separate fund to set up an unemployment scheme for  laid-off workers.    The government unveiled an austerity package this month to  rescue the country's economy. The program calls for new one-off  taxes, rapid privatization, closure of some state firms, selling  public property and tightening control on state expenditures.</p>

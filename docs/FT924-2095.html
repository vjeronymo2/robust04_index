			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / Conrad Black is paid settlement THE Independent on Sunday has agreed to apologise and pay substantial undisclosed damages to Mr Conrad Black, publisher of The Daily Telegraph, over a report about plans for the newspaper's flotation earlier this year. The report alleged that concern had been caused by Mr Black's retention of control through Hollinger, his Canadian company, and that being a minority shareholder in one of Mr Black's business interests had not always been a pleasant experience. It also suggested Mr Black had manipulated his Canadian company assets to enrich himself at the expense of minority shareholders. In reaching the out-of-court settlement, The Independent on Sunday accepted there was no truth in the allegations.</p>

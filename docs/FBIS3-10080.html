Meanwhile, Gustavo Roosen, president of the bank's  intervention board, said that the emergency law establishes  financial aid for Banco Latino, something that will allow the  implementation this week of strategies for the bank's  rehabilitation. Roosen explained that the banking law that has  been in effect since the beginning of this year envisages a  rehabilitation phase as long as the rules set by the Bank  Superintendency and the Deposit Guarantee Fund during the  intervention phase are followed. Roosen said the bank has lost  150 billion bolivares, an amount that can increase or diminish  depending on the work carried out by the current intervention  board.</p>

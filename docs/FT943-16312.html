			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Stagecoach and Sheffield Mainline link Stagecoach has agreed to swap shares with Sheffield Mainline Partnership, which was established in November through an employee buy-out from local authorities in South Yorkshire. Mainline has recommended its employees should vote for the deal, which involves the exchange of 20 per cent of Mainline's enlarged equity for 500,000 Stagecoach shares. Mainline said the proposal offered an opportunity to work with a leading bus group, while retaining the principles embodied within its employee-owned structure. Stagecoach said the agreement would increase its involvement in one of Britain's main metropolitan areas at a time of rapid development in the UK bus industry. Mr Derek Scott, finance director, said the agreement was a form of courtship: if the relationship worked out, the larger group would eventually seek full control of Mainline.</p>

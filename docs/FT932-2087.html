			<p>930621 FT  21 JUN 93 / Survey warns on Midland projects WEST MIDLANDS planners have been told there is no need for a further large out-of-town shopping centre. They have been told that such a centre would jeopardise investment elsewhere in the Birmingham-Black Country conurbation. These recommendations are contained in a study assessing the impact on the region of the Merry Hill shopping centre in Dudley by the consultants Roger Tym and Partners and Colquhoun Transportation Planning. The study, to be published soon, was commissioned by the region's local authorities, Centro, their public transport arm, the environment department and Marks and Spencer. Taken with the running dispute about the legality of the planning permission granted for a big retail development at Trafford, Manchester, the study's findings fuel the arguments about the merits of large out-of-town shopping centres when government economic and social policy is directed at inner city regeneration. Merry Hill, with 260 shops on 1.39m sq ft of retail floorspace, is the second largest shopping centre in Europe, exceeded only by MetroCentre in Gateshead. It was created by Richardson Developments on the site of an old steelworks, bought by Mountleigh in 1990 and, after Mountleigh called in the receivers, bought for Pounds 128m by Chelsfield last February. The Roger Tym study found that Merry Hill gained market share between 1989 and 1993. 'By far the biggest loss was at Dudley, whose 1993 market share is less than one third of the 1989 level,' it says. Stourbridge, West Bromwich and Kidderminister also suffered significant falls in market share. Mr Bill Brisbane, who worked on the study, noted that the Merry Hill impact was not unique. MetroCentre had hurt Gateshead, and Meadowhall outside Sheffield had hurt the town centre in the same way as Merry Hill had hurt Dudley. Anecdotal evidence suggested that the Lakeside centre at Thurrock was having a similar effect on Grays, Essex. Mr Brisbane suggested that although Merry Hill had created 3,370 jobs - 69 per cent of them part-time - to replace those lost by the closure of the steelworks and had drawn shoppers and hence funds into the region, it was not yet possible to say that out-of-town shopping centres had 'a positive net benefit' on the region in which they were situated. In the case of the West Midlands, the study concludes that, as there is unlikely to be significant population growth and 'in the short-term it is improbable that there will be substantial growth in consumer expenditure', there is little clear need for another centre such as Merry Hill.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Zhu Baihua] </F>   [Text] Beijing, February 28 (XINHUA) -- President of the  Bank of China [BOC] Wang Xuebing here today described the  unification of RMB [renminbi] exchange rates as successful and  predicted that there would be no drastic changes in the yuan's  rate in the foreseeable future.    "Everything has been going smoothly since the unification of  yuan exchange rates at the start of this year," said Wang, who  took the post as the top leader of the country's biggest foreign  exchange dealer two months ago.    The bank's business in foreign exchange settlement has not  been affected by the unification. Hard currency earners, most  of which are foreign trade firms, have sold all their foreign  exchange certificates (FEC) to the bank according to state  regulations.    "The working capital of foreign exchange in our bank has  remained stable," said Wang.    The first quarter of 1994 is supposed to be the transitional  period for China's foreign exchange control system to convert  from the old to the new. During this period, the Bank of China  is under instruction to withdraw FEC and set up a special  records file for enterprises to register the amounts in hard  currency earnings they sell to the bank.    Wang declined to say the amount of fec withdrawn by the bank  so far, but hinted that through spending and exchanging them for  U.S. dollars, it will not take long before the special banknotes  are completely withdrawn by the bank.    With eight years of experience as BOC branch chief in London  and then in New York, the 42-year-old Wang is well-known for his  expertise in gold and foreign exchange trading.    The unification of yuan exchange rates has not caused big  rises or falls in the rate so far. Wang expects the present  8.7:1 exchange rate to remain stable in the foreseeable future.    "China's overall economic growth is healthy, foreign trade  keeps increasing and the government is stepping up efforts to  control inflation. All these are favorable for the yuan to stay  stable," said Wang.    To pave the way for the second stage of foreign exchange  reform, or the operation of the new system which will start as  of April 1, said Wang, the Bank of China is improving its RMB  clearing system and mobilizing required amounts of capital funds  in both Chinese yuan and hard currencies.    In responding to clients' growing awareness of risks, the  bank has set about establishing a quotation system for future  yuan trading, Wang disclosed.</p>

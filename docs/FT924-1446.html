			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / Hopes fade for German pact HOPES of a rapid conclusion of the planned 'solidarity pact' between German government, opposition, trade unions and employers were fading yesterday as serious differences emerged over tax plans and aid to east German industry. Chancellor Helmut Kohl said he was still confident, hoping for substantive results in January or at the latest February - well after his original Christmas deadline. Agreement on such a deal, including an accord on wage restraint by trade unions and strict budget savings by central government and the 16 federal states, is seen as essential to a relaxation in interest rates by the Bundesbank. Mr Bjorn Engholm, leader of the opposition Social Democrats (SPD), said he believed the chances for a genuine pact were receding; some form of unilateral government declaration was more likely. Wide differences existed in how far the government was ready to maintain key east German industries, and what the opposition and trade unions were seeking. The government does not wish to give any general employment guarantee, and wants a strictly limited and defined policy of industrial subsidies for companies restructuring for identified new markets. The SPD and unions want at least 400 major east German enterprises saved. The other key difference is that Mr Kohl is only prepared to consider a tax increase to finance the debt burden of east Germany in 1995. The SPD and unions want more tax revenues next year, to cut the budget deficit and encourage a relaxation in the Bundesbank's strict monetary policy. Mr Kohl said the German business community was prepared to play its part in the solidarity pact. They were ready to guarantee large-scale training of eastern apprentices. Several insurance companies had agreed to provide urgent finance for increased house-building in the east. He was confident the unions were ready to present moderate wage claims, but urged public-sector unions to reach a new wage agreement by February at the latest. Many other west European countries had already embarked on drastic budget savings, including Spain, Britain and France. Mr Kohl promised a budget savings package in January, and a supplementary budget to provide more cash for the east in the first quarter. His plan for a 1995 tax rise should be agreed in the first half of 1993.</p>

			<p><P> April 16, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> THATCHER'S PLANS BACKFIRING ON HOMEOWNERS;  </P> <P> HIGHER INTEREST RATES FROM ANTI-INFLATION DRIVE PUT THOUSANDS IN ARREARS  </P> <P> Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's program to transform Britain into "a  property-owning democracy" has produced an army of new homeowners. But many are  being squeezed by her determination to curb inflation by driving up interest  rates.  </P> <P> Mortgage costs have risen at their fastest rate in 50 years, to 13.5% from  9.75% last summer, confronting many of Britain's 15 million homeowners with  heavy debt and even the risk of losing their homes, home buyers' advocates say.  </P> <P> Types of mortgages in the United States vary but their rates generally hover  around 10% to 10.5%.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Now Pays Interest Only  </P> <P> Stephanie Manasche, a single mother in Harrow, says her monthly payments have  jumped 42 pounds ($73.50) to 262 pounds ($458.50), and she had to negotiate a  temporary agreement with her lender to pay interest only. That brought the  payment down to 253 pounds ($443), and she is still having trouble keeping up.  </P> <P> "It makes me feel very, very frightened, obviously," she said.  </P> <P> The crunch could also make Britons lose confidence in real estate and return to  renting, undermining Thatcher's initial aims.  </P> <P> "The present government is pulling the rug out from underneath their feet,"  said Michael Brett, secretary general of the National Assn. of Homeowners in  Shrewsbury.  </P> <P> John Doling, a professor at the University of Birmingham's department of social  policy, said: "Many people will be deeply depressed, deeply suffering from what  has happened." Some, he says, "will have to economize on food and they won't  eat properly."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Other Factors Blamed  </P> <P> But lenders say defaults are more an outcome of unemployment and marital  breakup than of higher interest rates.  </P> <P> They stress their eagerness to help borrowers in difficulty by, for example,  extending the term of a mortgage.  </P> <P> "As long as those people come in and let us know, there are things we can do,"  said Mark Hemingway, a spokesman for the Halifax Building Society, the  country's biggest mortgage lender.  </P> <P> The monthly payment on a new 40,000-pound ($70,000) 25-year adjustable mortgage  has risen to 388.42 pounds ($679.74) from about 304.93 pounds ($533.63) last  summer, the Building Societies Assn. said.  </P> <P> Repayments on only the first 30,000 pounds ($52,000) of a mortgage are  tax-deductible. Most rates fluctuate with interest rates. Fixed rates are  rarely offered, and 40% of mortgage-holders have their monthly payment adjusted  once a year.  </P> <P> The squeeze worsened last year when young buyers rushed into the market and  overcommitted themselves trying to beat the abolition in August of double tax  relief for unmarried joint mortgage-holders.  </P> <P> "When people see prices going up rapidly they feel they have to be active in  the housing market right now before it is too late," Doling said.  </P> <P> In June, Thatcher's Conservative government began raising interest rates,  stalling the housing boom so that buyers who came in at the top of the market  can't get out at a profit.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Rolling Back Socialism  </P> <P> Thatcher has promoted home ownership as part of her campaign to roll back  socialism, allowing occupants of rented public housing to buy the property at  preferential terms.  </P> <P> Sixty-four percent of Britain's housing is occupant-owned, compared to 55% in  1978, the Building Societies Assn. said.  </P> <P> But now Thatcher says that inflation, which has jumped to an annual rate of  6.8% from 3.3% a year ago, is her top priority and interest rates are her  weapon.  </P> <P> "I think many people would find the irony in that," Doling said.  </P> <P> Brett, of the homeowners association, said, "We are predicting a massive rise  in the number of mortgage arrears and repossession."  </P> <P> In 1985, when mortgage rates went up to 14%, mortgage arrears doubled, Brett  said.  </P> <P> Today about 300,000 people are in arrears, while last year, 25,000 families saw  their homes repossessed, Brett said.  </P> <P> In addition, he said, "As soon as someone falls behind in mortgage payments,  even if they don't get repossessed, they will get a bad reputation financially  and will in fact be blighted for life."  </P> <P> The building societies association said up-to-date statistics aren't available  yet, and it expects arrears and repossession to show a decline because  unemployment is down.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Now It Is Ridiculous'  </P> <P> A 36-year-old bank employee from Liverpool who requested anonymity said: "A  couple of years ago, the mortgage was affordable. Now it is ridiculous."  </P> <P> Sarah Rudman, a 19-year-old advertising saleswoman, bought her Shrewsbury home  in September with fiance Stephen Chaloner, a 23-year-old software engineer.  Payments on their 21,000-pound ($36,750) mortgage have risen 57 pounds ($100),  to 220 pounds ($385) a month.  </P> <P> Now, Rudman said, they have to postpone the wedding and lower their living  standard.  </P> <P> "We were advised by a lot of people, 'You ought to have your own house. Buy  now.' We panicked really. We just grabbed it," she said.  </P></p>

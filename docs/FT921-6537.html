			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: Espirito Santo group wins control of bank THE Espirito Santo family has regained control of Banco Espirito Santo e Comercial de Lisboa (BESCL), Portugal's third largest bank, following the completion of its privatisation this week. The family owned a majority shareholding in the bank before its nationalisation in 1975. From exile in Brazil, it has steadily built up a new international financial group with holdings in Europe, the US and South America. The group began its come-back in Portugal in the 1980s, bought back control of Tranquilidade, one of Portugal's leading insurance companies, when it was privatised in 1990, and last July secured 23 per cent stake in BESCL when 40 per cent of the bank was sold. In this second stage of privatisation, 24m shares representing 60 per cent of the bank's share capital were sold raising Es89bn (Dollars 659m) - 1.7m shares remained with an underwriting syndicate. The Espirito Santo group (GES) increased its holding to 43 per cent in association with Credit Agricole of France which holds 9.5 per cent. In an earlier interview with the Financial Times, Mr Ricardo Espirito Santo Salgado, group chairman, said a 40 per cent stake would be sufficient to control the bank in view of the capital's dispersal among a large number of small investors. He said BESCL, a commercial bank with a domestic market share of around 9 per cent, would be the centre of the group but remain a retail bank, with other group companies specialising in investment banking and other activities both in Portugal and abroad. BESCL is expected to show a 20 per cent rise in assets to Es1,449bn last year from Es1,197bn in 1990 and net profits up to Es15bn from Es12.5bn. It recently bought Banco Industrial del Mediterraneo of Spain.</p>

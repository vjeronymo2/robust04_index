			<p>Language: <F P=105> Lao </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>   [Text] Last week, the U.S. Senate debated and endorsed the  establishment of Radio Free Asia with the aim of beaming news to  China, Myanmar [Burma], Tibet, the DPRK, Cambodia, Vietnam, and  the Lao Peoples's Democratic Republic [LPDR]. They claimed that  peoples in these countries lacked complete freedom of expression  and regarded the setting up of the radio station as an  instrument for conveying varied views to those peoples.    It is well known that during the Cold War period, the United  States utilized Radio Free Europe as one of its tools to oppose  the socialist countries in eastern Europe. That radio station  played an important role in interfering in the internal affairs  of those countries. In the last decade of the 20th century,  while the United States and other countries throughout the world  are expeditiously seeking ways to increase mutual cooperation  and understanding, the United States itself is considering  setting up a Radio Free Asia to oppose the countries in Asia.  It is surprising indeed.    The LPDR Foreign Affairs Ministry is of the view that the  establishment of Radio Free Asia by the Unites States runs  counter to the trend of promoting cooperation and creating peace  in this region and throughout the world. The only thing the  peoples and governments in this region want is that they hope  the United States will use other means of communications in an  effort to contribute to building mutual trust to facilitate the  promotion of economic, scientific, cultural, social cooperation,  and peace in Southeast Asia and the world.</p>

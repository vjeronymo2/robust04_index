			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Fire broke out today at the tap transformer of the  third bloc of Dukovany [South Moravia] nuclear power station.  Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus reported on this at noon:    [Begin Klaus recording] The fire broke out at 0712 hours and  was localized withing 30 minutes. I stress that the fire broke  out as a result of a fault on the tap transformer. This electric  facility is located in an open area about 50 meters from the  reactor hall. From this point of view, this fire did not at all  touch the area of nuclear safety and, from the point of view of  the internationally recognized scale that is used to assess  accidents from the nuclear safety point of view, the situation  was of the lowest degree of alert, that is zero. This means  that there was no infringement upon nuclear safety or radiation  protection, and no radioactive substances escaped into the  environment as a result of this emergency situation.    There was even no need to apply any emergency measures to  protect the reactor against the tap transformer fire. [end  recording]</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The nationalist conservative group within the  Fatherland National Party is convinced that Mart Laar, prime  minister and chairman of the Fatherland Party, will no longer be  able to continue to be in charge of the government or the party  under the present circumstances. This was reported to ETA by  the Board of the nationalist conservative group. They have  proposed Enn Tarto for the post of chairman of the Fatherland  Party. Tarto is the chairman of the nationalist conservative  group and a member of the Riigikogu. The Fatherland's Tallinn  branch has already proposed [parliamentary Speaker] Ulo Nugis  for the job.</p>

			<p>930913 FT  13 SEP 93 / Personal View: Age of the risk taker What develop-ments might have the biggest potential impact on financial markets? Experts typically cite innovations such as exotic derivative in-struments or asset securitisation or greatly expanded international trading activity. But in the US at least, arguably the most significant development is the enlarged role of the household sector as a financial risk taker. Millions of people have branched out from passively holding bank deposits and indirectly owning securities through such intermediaries as pension funds to becoming direct participants in financial markets - and thus are exposed to risks beyond those they are accustomed to. In 1978, American individuals, farmers and small businesses held about 40 per cent of their total assets in deposit form. By the first quarter of 1993, the share of deposits and money funds with no capital risk had dwindled to 24 per cent of total financial assets. In 1978 Americans held only about a third of their total financial assets in instruments directly carrying market risk: 19 per cent in common stock, 7 per cent in bonds and 6 per cent in miscellaneous assets. Only 1.2 per cent was invested in mutual funds of any kind. Today, assets directly carrying capital risk account for almost 40 per cent of total financial assets. Of that, 16 per cent is in common stocks, 9 per cent in bonds and 7 per cent in miscellaneous assets. Equity and bond mutual funds have surged to 7 per cent. Mutual funds continue to mushroom - up by an estimated Dollars 22bn (Pounds 14.6bn) a month so far this year, a third higher than last year's monthly average and four times the Dollars 5bn monthly average posted as recently as 1990. Mutual funds represent the largest institutional buyer of American equities and of tax-exempt municipal bonds, and they rank high as buyers of taxable bonds. The other significant shift in household portfolios has been the steady expansion of retirement funds. Back in 1978, a fifth of household total assets was invested through pension plans, mostly defined benefit plans for which the sponsoring employer bore the ultimate capital risk on investments. At present, pension fund reserves have risen to about a third of total household financial assets. But an increasing share of those funds represents defined contribution plans, where the worker bears the capital risk on the investments not the employer. Defined benefit retirement plans, which tend to be sponsored by the same large corporations now engaged in restructuring, are shrinking. Over time, a shift toward defined contribution pension plans will leave affected retirees with greater financial uncertainty. Retirement income will depend not only on the type of investments in the plan but also on market conditions when retirement takes place, a significant risk to the retiree. What are the ramifications of these changes? First, the shift away from deposits, like the shift away from defined benefit retirement plans, is a transfer from obligations assuring the nominal capital value of the assets to those whose future values are unknown. Mutual funds are see-through institutions, taking no risks of their own. Risk and reward are passed on to fund holders. Banks, in contrast, provide stated returns and interpose their own capital to take additional risks. But mutual fund investors may not appreciate all the risks they are taking on. They may act quite unpredictably if a sudden market upheaval dramatically reveals the true risk. Second, a large increase in money rates will surely induce significant shifts back into deposits and money market funds. This may provoke far greater and quicker declines in the value of equities and of bonds than in prior decades, when longer maturity obligations were largely in institutional portfolios. The economic impact should also be quite abrupt. In this new financial world, changes in stock and bond prices will have a more noticeable wealth effect on individuals. Consequently, personal consumption, which cyclically tends to be more stable than other components of economic activity, will take on much more of a cyclical hue. For central banks, all this will pose unfamiliar challenges. A sharp shift by households out of mutual funds into deposits and money market funds will hurt bond and stock markets, but will increase the growth of money. Will this be interpreted as a symptom of future economic growth or a precursor of contraction? Indeed, the greater volatility coming from these structural changes may well induce public pressures for greater official intervention in the financial markets. Whipsawed by greater swings in their financial wealth, investors may demand that the government find a way to intervene in segments of the financial markets heretofore considered off-limits for 'open market operations', notably the equity market. This is not going to happen today or tomorrow, but if reports from Tokyo earlier this year are right, the Japanese government purportedly persuaded state pension funds to step into the Japanese equity market to give stock prices a lift. Who is to say that a similar form of intervention could not be devised in, say, the US or UK? Lately, we have seen the pleasant side of volatility, rising stocks and bond prices with just occasional interruptions. But the dark side of volatility is bound to come again. When it does we may get the answer to what will be the central question - whether economic growth is sustainable if the financial markets are challenged by a rise in interest rates and households are threatened more directly than in the past by a decline in the value of their financial assets.

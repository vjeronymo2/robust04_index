			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / International Company News: Pacific Telesis to spin off wireless unit PACIFIC Telesis, the California-based local telephone company, yesterday announced plans to spin off its wireless communications business in the boldest move yet by one of the 'Baby Bell' telephone companies to cope with increasing competition in the US telecommunications industry. The decision, announced following a special board meeting in San Francisco, means that the wireless business, one of the largest cellular telephone operators in the US, will become totally independent from the local telephone business, which serves most of California and parts of Nevada. The wireless business also has significant interests in Germany, France and other European markets. Mr Sam Ginn, chairman, said the spin-off would enhance shareholder value by creating separate, publicly traded companies able to react quickly to changes in the telecommunications market. It would also eliminate many of the financial, legal and regulatory restraints to the group's growth. Pacific Telesis is one of the seven ' Baby Bell' regional telephone companies spun off in 1984 from AT&amp;T under a court-ordered break-up of the group. The Baby Bells face increasing competition from independent telecommunications companies serving business clients, while themselves remaining subject to heavy local regulation.</p>

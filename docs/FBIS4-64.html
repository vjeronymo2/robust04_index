			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by P Bulger] </F>   [Text] Johannesburg March 31 SAPA -- Freedom Front leader  Constand Viljoen said he doubted President F W de Klerk's  assurance that kwaZulu would not suffer the same fate as  Bophuthatswana, Ciskei, Lebowa and Qwaqwa, SABC radio news  reported.    Gen Viljoen questioned the manner in which Mr de Klerk had  declared the state of emergency in Natal/kwaZulu, saying he  doubted denials that the African National Congress and National  Party [NP] had not planned the emergency beforehand. He said he  would consider inviting all parties, excluding the NP and ANC,  to discuss whether the elections should be held in April.    CP leader Ferdi Hartzenberg also criticised the  announcement.  He said the intention was to overthrow the kwaZulu government  and to compromise Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini's authority. He  said there could be no talk of a free and fair election under a  state of emergency.</p>

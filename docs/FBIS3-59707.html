			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ryuzo Yamaoka, Director, Technical Division, </F> Phosphoric Acid Fuel Cell, Technology Research Association]    [Text]  <H5>  Introduction </H5>   Much attention has been paid to fuel cells since the 1970s  in  Japan because of the expectation for their excellent energy  efficiency and environmentally friendly power generation. Among  several types of fuel cells being developed, phosphoric acid  fuel cells (PAFC) offer the highest promise of practical  application in the near future as an advanced power generation  plant, and thus R&amp;D on PAFC systems has been promoted  vigorously.    Japan's original R&amp;D activity for PAFC power plants was  initiated in 1981 as part of the government's Moonlight Project.  Following the development of fundamental technology and  elemental components, two types of 1MW PAFC pilot plants for  utility application and two types of 200kW cogeneration pilot  plants for on-site and remote island application were developed.  The demonstration tests of these plants were conducted  successfully in 1987-88 and 1989-91, respectively.    In the private sector, Japanese major electric and gas  utility companies started their R&amp;D on PAFC in the 1970s, and  demonstration tests of a 4.5MW PAFC power plant and 40kW on-site  fuel cells were carried out in the middle of '80s at a power  station and customer sites. Research and development work on  elemental components, such as fuel cell stack, reformer and  inverter, and on system technology has been pursued under these  projects, resulting in substantial development progress of  fundamental technologies for PAFC power plants. PAFC development  for practical application has been continued into the 1990s. The  efforts included the demonstration test of an 11MW power plant  for utility use and field tests of 50 to 200kW on-site fuel  cells.    Considering these developments, MITI started in 1991 and  1992  two projects aiming at early market entry of PAFC. One is the  field test of small-size, on-site fuel cells at various customer  sites. In this project, private field test programs are  subsidized by NEDO. The other is the development of two  large-scale PAFC power plants -- a 5MW PAFC power plant for  urban energy center application and a 1MW on-site PAFC  cogeneration plant. A PAFC technology research association  established in 1991 by fourteen electric and gas utility  companies is promoting development and demonstration tests of  these power plants.  <H3>  Demonstration, Evaluation and Field Tests of Small-Size  On-Site Fuel Cells </H3>   In 1993, over 50 on-site PAFC power generation units,  ranging  in capacity from 50kW to 500kW, are being operated at various  customer buildings and utility testing facilities in Japan for  demonstration and evaluation. Some of these efforts are  subsidized by MITI, with NEDO funding one third of the  installation cost.    Efficiency, compactness and environmental features have been  almost achieved to meet the requirements of the market.  Reliability and durability have also been improved. One of these  on-site PAFC power plants has already attained a total operating  time of over 15,000 hours -- the longest ever. It also has  achieved the longest continuous operation time of over 5,000  hours. Most recent plants show availability of around 80&percnt;.  <H3>  Development and Demonstration of 5000kW and 1000kW PAFC  Power Plants </H3>   A 6-year development and demonstration project, involving a  5000kW class PAFC power plant for urban energy center  application and a 1000kW class PAFC power plant for large-scale  cogeneration, was started in 1991 as an NEDO and PAFC-TRA  collaboration. This project aims to establish technologies for  utilizing PAFCs in electric utility application and  commercializing large-scale PAFC cogeneration systems, from the  aspects of reliability and cost reduction.  <H5>  (1) 5000kW PAFC Power Plant </H5>   Major subjects considered in the development of the 5000kW  PAFC power plant are as follows:    -- High electrical efficiency plant for electric utility use    -- Dispersed electric power generation in urban areas    -- Grid connection and weekly start-and-stop (WSS) operation    -- Environmental soundness (low emissions)    -- Waste heat recovery system for urban energy center  application    Table 1 summarizes the target specifications of the 5000kW  PAFC power plant.

Manufacturing, installation and PAC test are scheduled for 1993  and 1994, to be followed by demonstration tests in 1995-96.  <H5>  Future Prospects </H5>   Development of PAFC power plant technology has now reached  the stage where small-size, on-site fuel cells are on the  threshold of practical application. Major problems yet to be  overcome for commercialization are reliability and cost.    Vigorous efforts toward commercial application of PAFC  plants  are in progress in both the public and private sectors through  day-to-day technological development and testing, with  particular emphasis placed on reliability improvement meeting  the user's requirements in a few years. Manufacturers are also  stepping up their efforts to advance PAFC technology, including  mass production systems, that could lead to substantial cost  reduction.    Policy and marketing strategy for practical application of  PAFCs are being addressed on a nationwide scale. The market  penetration of PAFC power plants is expected to begin in the  middle of the 1990s.</p>

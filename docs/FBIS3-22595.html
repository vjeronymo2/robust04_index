She said most unreported cases appeared to be  mother-to-child infections.    She said that in the 1993/4 fiscal year, more than  R[rand]21,056,000 had been allocated to AIDS support, research  and information, marketing, training and health education and  administration. Non-governmental organisations received  R2,074,000.    Although this budget might be considered insufficient, it  had  to be remembered the government had a multi-faceted approach to  the pandemic and was orientated towards a preventative approach  rather than a curative one, said Dr. Venter.    She said a task force of the National AIDS Co-ordinating  Committee of South Africa was developing a national plan, and  the committee was being extended at regional level. "An AIDS  health promotion programme should be an integral part of the  local authority's existing health policy and control  programmes," said Dr. Venter. Community participation plays an  integral part of AIDS prevention activities. It means much more  than merely complying with medical prescriptions or contributing  labour and money to health plans that others have already judged  appropriate for various communities. Participation simply means  an alliance between communities, policy makers and health care  workers for a common purpose."    She said when a community was involved in all aspects of  AIDS  prevention, new ideas and practices were widely and rapidly  diffused. "Social networks are activated. People with similar  values and experience trust and accept a [words indistinct]  other than institutions reaching the `hard to reach' on their  own terms may be the most valuable contribution of community  participation."    Dr. Venter said the AIDS pandemic would have a wide-ranging  socio-economic impact on many sectors of the southern African  community, besides the health care system. "Sophisticated first  world medical care could not only be unaffordable but it would  also be inappropriate. The challenge is to ensure that AIDS  prevention be made a high priority within the context of other  health and social issues."</p>

BRIEFING;  </P> <P> PPG SELLS SHARE OF GERMAN FIRM  </P> <P> PPG Industries has sold its 75% interest in West German equipment maker  Lenhardt Maschinenbau GmbH, the company said today.  </P> <P> The buyer is Bystronic Maschinen AG of Butzberg, Switzerland. The purchase  price was not given. General Manager Karl Lenhardt holds the remaining shares  in the company.  </P> <P> Lenhardt, based in Neuhausen-Hamberg, makes equipment used to produce  insulating glass units and other fabricated glass products. Bystronic produces  equipment for the glass, metals, plastics and agriculture industries.  </P> <P> PPG said it sold its interest because the fabricating equipment business no  longer is appropriate to its long-term strategic objectives.

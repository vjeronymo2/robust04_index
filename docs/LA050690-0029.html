			<p><P> May 6, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DANNEMEYER PROTEST  </P> <P> Re: Gay Activists Protest Dannemeyer Event (April 30): "Dannemeyer Event?"  </P> <P> The other 49 authors (I included) who were honored at the 25th annual UCI  Friends of the Library dinner will be astonished and insulted to see it so  described.  </P> <P> Did your reporter stay for the event? She -- and the demonstrators -- might  have been reminded that libraries exist to house everybody's beliefs and ideas  -- including homosexuals and their enemies.  </P> <P> Freedom of speech is our lifeblood, and yours. The hot-eyed censors among us  can only be encouraged by this kind of truth-bashing.  </P> <P> JEAN FEMLING  </P> <P> Costa Mesa  </P></p>

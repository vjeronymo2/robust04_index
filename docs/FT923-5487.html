			<p>920901 FT  01 SEP 92 / Japan poised to bail out troubled banking system THE Japanese government took an important step towards a possible bailout of the nation's troubled banking industry yesterday in a further measure to bolster the economy. Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, said the government was ready to provide public funds to help banks liquidate non-performing loans. This follows the Y10,700bn (Pounds 43bn) emergency spending package announced last Friday aimed at boosting economic growth. Although schemes to support the banking system have been widely discussed during the past two weeks, Mr Miyazawa is the first senior government official to endorse the idea of using public money to support such a plan. Government backing for a bank bailout promises to be highly controversial, with newspapers and magazines already questioning why taxpayers should foot the bill for the imprudence and greed of the nation's banks. 'If the problem will cause instability in the nation's financial system, neither the government nor the Bank of Japan can afford to remain idle,' Mr Miyazawa said. In addition to fears of instability, Mr Miyazawa was concerned that the accumulation of bad debt had reduced the banks' lending capacity and contributed to economic slowdown. In a scheme likened to the Resolution Trust Corporation in the US, the banking industry has been drawing up plans to form a corporation to purchase bad loans or land held as collateral for bad loans from the banks. Analysts estimate that loans on which no interest is being paid currently total between Y25,000bn and Y30,000bn. The government would have to overcome substantial practical difficulties to make the scheme work. It remains unclear how such a corporation would be owned or managed, how land would be priced, or which banks would be eligible to sell land to the scheme. Conflicts of interest among banks may also be extremely complex. Fear of a possible collapse in the banking industry was one factor behind a plunge in the stock market two weeks ago to a six-year low. The market was turned around, however, by Friday's measures and by further evidence that the government would step in to support the financial system.

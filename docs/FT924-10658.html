			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / Deputies unite to attack judges over inquiries POLITICAL divisions in the usually fractious Italian parliament were blurred yesterday as members united in anger against a judiciary they accused of violating their rights in a series of corruption investigations, Reuter reports from Rome. The row pitting parliament against Italy's increasingly inquisitive judges came to a head after Health Minister Francesco de Lorenzo said police had tried to seize his personal archives, ignoring his immunity from prosecution. 'We are living in a pre-coup climate,' said Mr Domenico Susi, a Socialist MP who yesterday also denounced a judge's decision to impound his private office. MPs from all parties condemned the two incidents, saying democracy was in danger. 'The balance of power between the various branches of government is being upset. Whenever this happens, we usually are on the eve of some of the least glorious pages of our history,' said the Christian Democrats' chief whip, Mr Gerardo Bianco. The MPs were finally seeing their chance to hit back at the judges, who have launched investigations hitting every sector of the political establishment since the new parliament was elected last April. 'There is a climate of intimidation undermining the rights of MPs without which this country is no longer a democracy,' said Mr Giusy La Ganga, Socialist chief whip, urging the government to act against the judges. Only since the April elections upset Italy's political balance have the judges been spurred into action.</p>

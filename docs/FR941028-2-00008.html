In conjunction with the new index procedures, additional changes to the prices received and paid data series will be made as itemized below. All changes will take effect beginning in January 1995 with data published in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 --> Agricultural Prices <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The prices received and paid indexes are used in computing the parity prices that NASS is required by statute to publish monthly (7 U.S.C. 1301(a)(1)(c)). The base or fixed weights used in constructing the indexes have become outdated as the mix of commodities farmers produce and input items they purchase have changed and are expected to continue to change over time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Major changes to the weights and construction of the price indexes and to the prices received and paid data series are:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) A 1990&hyph;92 reference and base period will replace the current 1977 reference and 1971&hyph;73 base period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Five-year moving average weights will replace the current fixed 1971&hyph;73 base period weights.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Monthly marketing weights that reflect seasonal marketing patterns will be added for prices received commodities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) The 36-month (1990&hyph;92) average prices used as base period prices for the prices received indexes will be weighted by monthly volumes of farmers' sales. The current base period (1971&hyph;73) prices are simple averages.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) The new indexes will be constructed by multiplying the ratios of the current prices to the base period prices by the moving average weights (adjusted for seasonal marketing patterns for the prices received indexes).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) Crop coverage will be expanded in the prices received indexes, largely for fruits, vegetables, greenhouse/nursery products, and specialty crops.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) Prices Paid Surveys for feed, fuels, fertilizer, agricultural chemicals, retail seeds, and farm machinery will be conducted annually in April. The prices paid indexes will still be updated quarterly based on changes in appropriate Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) component indexes. Prices Paid Surveys for autos and trucks, building materials, farm supplies, motor supplies, and marketing containers will be discontinued. BLS component indexes will be used to measure price changes for these and other input items. Feeder livestock price surveys will continue quarterly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (8) Separate prices paid indexes for crop and livestock farms will be computed and published.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (9) The 1910&hyph;14=100 price indexes required by statute (7 U.S.C. 1301(a)(1)(c)) for computing parity prices will be determined based on the changes in the new 1990&hyph;92=100 indexes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Beginning in January 1995, the new 1990&hyph;92 indexes will be published monthly in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Agricultural Prices  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> for prices received and quarterly for prices paid. The new 1990&hyph;92 based indexes will be constructed back to 1975. The revised 1910&hyph;14 indexes and the new 1990&hyph;92 indexes covering the 1975&hyph;93 period will be published in a separate release by the end of January 1995. The old 1977 indexes, except for the fresh market fruit and vegetable and seasonally adjusted prices received indexes, will be available upon request during 1995 but discontinued thereafter. The fresh market fruit and vegetable indexes and the seasonally adjusted indexes now published for fresh market fruits, fresh market vegetables, potatoes and dry beans, dairy products, and poultry and eggs will be discontinued in January 1995. Prices paid estimates for building materials, farm and motor supplies, and new autos and trucks will no longer be published.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The changes in the construction of the indexes will simplify updating the component items and reference periods while maintaining appropriate weights. The new index procedures will provide long-term comparability in computing future index numbers, reduce respondent burden, and better utilize existing Government data. The overall changes will not have a significant effect on the levels of the prices received and prices paid indexes, and, therefore, will have very little effect on the levels of parity prices.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Done in Washington, D.C., this 24th day of October 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Rich Allen, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNER> <SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=1 --> Acting Administrator. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNJOB> <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;26767 Filed 10&hyph;27&hyph;94; 8:45 am] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 3410&hyph;20&hyph;P <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

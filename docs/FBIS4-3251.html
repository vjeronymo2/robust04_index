			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By political editor Chip Tsao and Wing Kay Po] </F>   [Text] Two of Hong Kong's main political parties, the  United Democrats and Meeting Point, will merge into a new party  named the Democratic Party in October. The move was announced  by the leader of the United Democrats, Martin Lee, and the  chairman of Meeting Point, Anthony Cheung. The new party will  take up 17 directly- elected seats out of 18 in the Legislative  Council and will become the party with the most seats.    In a move that unites the democratic forces of Hong Kong and  appears to be a setback to China's united front tactic, Lee  appealed to other democrats to join the new party. Lee hailed  the merger as a historic milestone in Hong Kong's democratic  development and warned China that the new party would be "too  big" for China to "handle". "This is the time for Hong Kong  people who want a bright future for Hong Kong to stand  together," he said. "The new party will not be intimidated by  threats from Beijing, (and) will take a stand on principles,  including human rights, the rule of law and democracy."    Cheung said he would still convey the anxiety and concern of  the Hong Kong people to China as a Hong Kong affairs adviser  after the new party was launched. "I did not tell Beijing  (about the impending merger) when they invited me to become a  Hong Kong affairs adviser," Cheung said. "If the Chinese  government hopes these Hong Kong affairs advisers appointed will  channel Hong Kong people's opinions, then I do not see any  reasons why my status as a Hong Kong affairs adviser will be  affected by this move and why the Chinese government should  dislike the new party."    Lee said that the intensity of the pressure coming from  China  was the reason why the two parties had decided to merge. "Those  who often read newspapers will be left in no doubt that our  pressure has been increasing and our room has been decreasing,"  Lee said. "Just listen to what the Chinese have been saying in  recent years and look at things like the Xi Yang case."    Both leaders said that they had common ground on several  issues and that they would bury the minor differences between  the two sides to work for an open and democratic government for  Hong Kong with a high degree of autonomy. They said they would  work closely together in the elections.    Since the two parties will not formally merge until October,  they will still field separate candidates to contest the  district board elections to be held in September. Lee said he  hoped that the new Democratic Party would win at least 14 seats  in the 1995 Legislative Council election. Details of the merger  will be discussed at a general meeting on May 15.    Federick Fung Kin-kee, chairman of the Association for  Democracy and People's Livelihood, said his party would  certainly consider joining the new Democratic Party as an option.    Selina Chow, of the Liberals, said she was not surprised by  the move and this would not affect the Liberal Party's political  course. "In the past they have been voting together and they  have been politically very close.    "It is a natural development," Chow said. James Tien,  another Liberal member, was less optimistic and said his party  would have to reconsider its strategy in this year's district  board elections.    "It is obvious now that the two parties will be fielding  only  one candidate in each district.    "This will give us a difficult time," Tien said.    Tsang Yok-shing, chairman of the pro-Chinese Democratic  Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong (DAB), said the new  party "would not help to dilute the anti-communist image of the  United Democrats".</p>

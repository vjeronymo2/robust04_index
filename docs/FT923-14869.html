			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / Top public-sector pay has risen above average THE PAY of some groups covered by the Top Salaries Review Body has risen faster than the increase in average earnings since 1979, when the first Thatcher government was elected. The disclosure comes as the cabinet prepares to discuss the latest report from the body, which is said to recommend substantial rises for senior civil servants, military personnel and judges. New Treasury figures show that the pay of the head of the Civil Service, the chief of defence staff and of senior circuit judges has risen by 338 per cent since 1979, compared with an increase of 318 per cent in average earnings. Last year the weekly salary of Sir Robin Butler, the head of the Civil Service, was Pounds 2,006.70 - on a par with Field Marshal Sir Richard Vincent, chief of defence staff, or some seven times average earnings of Pounds 284.70 per week. In 1985, the last time there was a thorough review, the pay of those covered rose between 7 per cent and 46.3 per cent. The government was able to command only a 17-vote majority on the issue against its normal majority of more than 100. The cabinet decision on whether to accept the review body's recommendations must be announced to MPs in the next two weeks, before the recess. Senior Tory backbenchers have made clear their concern that the increments should not be substantial. The Treasury information came in a Commons written answer to Mr Michael Meacher, shadow social security secretary. Mr Meacher said yesterday that Labour would regard government approval of increases of anything approaching 30 per cent as 'absolutely outrageous'. The party would oppose such a measure with a three-line whip in any debate. 'At a time of slump it is provocative for those on the highest pay to take more than the average increase,' he said.</p>

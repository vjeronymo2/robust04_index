			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By correspondent Alisher Khodzhayev; from the "Novosti" </F> newscast]    [Text] By decision of the Tajik Government, the state  national security committee has been transformed into the Tajik  Security Ministry. What is the reason for this and what will it  change in the work of what was once a menacing department?  Besides catching spies, the department is currently involved in  dozens of tasks ranging from border defense and the confiscation  of weapons to distributing bread to the shops.    [Begin recording] [S. Zukhurov, Tajik security minister] We  got rid of the words national security. Questions arose because  national security implies protecting the interests of only the  indigenous nationality, the indigenous peoples. With the  formation of the ministry, we shall probably bear the  responsibility for the fight against economic crime. Trends  like the fight against terrorism, against the drug mafia,  against arms smuggling will be stepped up.    [Khodzhayev] Will the functions of the Security Ministry --  we shall call it that -- include the struggle against the  political opposition?    [Zukhurov] We are categorically opposed to such a method of  struggle, because, we are seeking all paths, possibilities for  dialogue with the opposition. [end recording]</p>

In addition, because of the very conservative approach to estimating the number of incidental takes, it is considered extremely unlikely that explosives detonations in the OSTR will result in incidental take levels approaching the requested level.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Scientific Evidence  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Commenters stated that NMFS did not use the best available scientific evidence available and that the data used were dated because they were over a decade old. Two commenters referred to ``recent scientific evidence'' showing that sound pressure waves seriously impact marine life.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NMFS uses both the MMPA and the ESA standard of ``the best available scientific and commercial data'' to determine the impacts of activities on marine mammals. Although NMFS would like to have more baseline data on marine mammals within the SCB and more information on the effects of large-charge detonations on marine life, in particular on marine mammals, NMFS based its decision on the best information available, including NMFS marine mammal assessment surveys conducted in 1991 and 1992 and Defense Department research on the effects of explosions on marine life. NMFS is not aware of any more recent scientific evidence that would be contrary to its findings and two commenters did not provide citations or references to any new information. Also, without knowledge of scientific evidence contrary to research used in its determination, NMFS is confident that it used the best scientific and commercial data available in making its determination. However, monitoring is a requirement of the regulations and for a continuation of the LOA. The results from the monitoring will be used to verify (or refute) the findings made by NMFS, and if new evidence or data indicate that the impact on marine mammals is more than negligible, NMFS will reassess its findings and take appropriate action as mandated by section 101(a)(5)(B)(ii) of the MMPA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The EA, upon which the proposed regulations rely, fails to meet the standards mandated by the MMPA because NMFS failed not only in obtaining the best scientific evidence available, but failed in using even the limited evidence available as a basis for a reasoned conclusion. For instance, the Navy has indicated to NMFS that tests will not be conducted if marine mammals are detected within the testing zone *&blank;*&blank;* and NMFS concluded *&blank;*&blank;* that such efforts will minimize impacts to marine mammals, despite knowing that many marine mammals will not be visible by aerial survey. The commenter continues that the Navy, given its years of experience under the seas, should be able to detect marine mammals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

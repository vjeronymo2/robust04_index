			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (4): Locations that make sense - Overseas investment 2 / The offshore route / Don't be too parochial about taking opportunities not available from onshore funds, and at little or no extra regulatory risk Unit and investment trusts are widely used ways of investing overseas. But overseas should not be confused with offshore, though one of the plusses of what are called offshore investment funds is the greater choice of foreign investments. Offshore, as used in the investment fund industry, relates to where the fund itself is located for tax and regulation, rather than the location of what it is investing in. Put your money in, for example, Schroder Global Emerging Markets, a UK-authorised unit trust investing in some of the world's most far-flung and racy stock markets, and that is overseas investment, but not offshore. But park your savings in Fidelity's Sterling Money Funds, which invest in plodding UK deposits, and that is offshore investment, because the funds are set up as investment companies in Bermuda. With its exotic locations, scandals such as Barlow Clowes and associations with tax-evasion, offshore investment has had something of a shady image. And it is true that a lot of offshore funds are not as well regulated as onshore unit and investment trusts, and many offshore centres in which funds are based do not offer compensation arrangements on a par with those of the UK should anything go wrong (fraud, bankruptcy, incompetent or negligent investment management or administration). But UK investors should not be too parochial. A growing number of investment funds being launched and promoted to UK investors are based offshore - typically in Luxembourg, Dublin or the Channel Islands - for perfectly sensible commercial reasons, rather than anything underhand. Many, particularly those from well-known investment management companies, offer attractive and legitimate opportunities not available from onshore funds at, in practice, little or no extra regulatory risk. From Italy to Columbia, the offshore world offers a greater choice of funds investing in individual, smaller stock markets than UK-based unit and investment trusts. In addition, investors wanting to back a particular European bond market, such as those of France or Germany, will find such funds offshore, but not onshore. Currency funds are another investment that is only available offshore. What are known as single-currency funds allow investors to speculate on the movements of individual currencies without investing in foreign shares or bonds. Managed currency funds are for investors wanting to play currencies but leave the choice in the hands of an investment manager. Derivative-based investment is also more readily available offshore. Real bulls of Japan can buy Japanese warrant funds offshore; or for nervous investors there is a wide choice of funds with money-back guarantees. Offshore is also the home for the infamous hedge funds, including George Soros' Quantum Fund. Tax evasion may well be the reason why some people invest offshore. But offshore funds also offer some perfectly legal ways of deferring or even avoiding tax. The main tax plus is that offshore funds pay their income gross. Onshore unit or investment trusts, by contrast, pay income net of basic-rate tax. That difference means that, with offshore funds, non-taxpayers do not have the hassle of claiming tax back. Equally, taxpayers can have the full use of a fund's gross income until they make their tax return. It is also possible to postpone, or even avoid tax, through investment in offshore 'roll-up' or accumulation funds. As their name suggests, the funds roll up their income. Tax is only due when the holding is sold. Investors who wait until they are in a lower tax bracket, perhaps after they retire, can benefit from a lower tax bill. The wheeze may prove less attractive than it sounds, however, because any capital gains from roll-up funds are also treated as income for tax purposes. Nevertheless, for investors who plan to move, work or retire abroad, such funds can be a way of escaping the UK tax net altogether. So what should investors looking to take the plunge offshore consider? Can I buy the same or an equivalent UK-based unit or investment trust? If so, are the potential tax benefits of going offshore enough to offset any potentially greater risks or hassles? Bear in mind, too, that most unit and investment trusts can be held in a personal equity plan (Pep) for tax-free income and capital gains. Offshore funds, by contrast, are not Pep-able. Are you really likely to benefit from a roll-up fund? If not, and you still want to go offshore, look for what is known as a distributor fund, whose returns are effectively subject to the same tax regime as (unPepped) unit and investment trusts, except that income is still paid out gross. Stick to the bigger, less exotic offshore centres. The UK regulators say that Jersey, Guernsey, the Isle of Man and Bermuda have investor protection arrangements at least as good as those in mainland UK (including compensation schemes), while Luxembourg and Dublin are also considered relatively well-regulated. Look for funds with what is known as 'Ucits' status or SIB-recognition. Ucits relates to a common European minimum standard for regulation; SIB-recognition means the UK's chief financial services regulator has looked over the fund and approved its promotion to UK investors. Buy through a UK-authorised financial adviser. That should increase your chances of getting compensation if something goes wrong. Try to stick with the big-name, blue-chip managers that you have heard of. You will probably feel more confident that your money is in safe hands. And they are more likely to have a UK contact point, which should make the administration of your investment easier. The costs of offshore funds - management, administration and dealing - can be more opaque than those on unit and investment trusts. Beware of simplistic comparisons. Quoted charges may be lower, but overall costs can work out higher than on onshore funds. Watch out for comparisons between the performance of offshore funds and, in particular, unit trusts. Offshore fund performance figures will tend to look unfairly favourable, because they do not include dealing costs and assume the reinvestment of gross income. Be aware that offshore funds are often denominated in foreign currencies - most commonly dollars - and of the associated risks and any costs. When you repatriate your investment, if sterling has appreciated against the currency the fund is denominated in, you will lose out. This is aside from any currency exposure the fund itself may have had. In addition, check what, if any, costs - administrative and exchange - are involved if, say, you are handing over sterling to invest in a dollar-denominated fund.</p>

			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / Observer: Cherry picker Few ex-diplomats can have picked up as many advisory jobs in such a short space of time as Sir John Whitehead, Britain's ambassador to Japan for six years until his retirement last summer. He has set up office at Morgan Grenfell, where he's a senior adviser, and is also advising the president of the Board of Trade and the Welsh Development Agency. Last week Guinness made him its international affairs adviser, and yesterday it was Inchcape's turn to recruit him as adviser on Japanese affairs. It seems that Cable and Wireless is about to hire him, too. Since he was dashing for a flight to Japan at the start of a packed three-week programme, he didn't have time to answer Observer's query about how many more such juicy jobs he planned to take. But it sounds as though he already has enough on his plate, if he's going to give value for money.</p>

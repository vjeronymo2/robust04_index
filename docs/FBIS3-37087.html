Speaking to journalists prior to his departure, Nazarbayev  said this visit, his second to the United States, promises to be  highly productive. He voiced the hope that the forthcoming  summit talks and meetings with business circles will inject a  new economic and political quality to diverse Kazakhstan-U.S.  ties. Increased mutually beneficial cooperation with the United  States, he said, will greatly help the republic to lift its  economy.    The leader of Kazakhstan also announced that on the return  journey, he will stop over in Paris at the invitation of  President Francois Mitterrand. Their meeting will look at ways  of developing existing agreements on bilateral cooperation.</p>

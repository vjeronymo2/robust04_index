Final  </P> <P> SIDELINES;  </P> <P> ENGLISH SOCCER CLUB WARNED  </P> <P> A first-division English soccer team was warned today that it could be expelled  if there is another incident of fan violence similar to the one that  accompanied a victory in May.  </P> <P> The Football Assn., English soccer's governing body, said it would revoke Leeds  United's membership as "the ultimate sanction."  </P> <P> "It is not a likely scenario, but it is a possible scenario," said David  Bloomfield, the FA's spokesman.  </P> <P> About 2,000 Leeds fans rampaged through Bournemouth, England, before, during  and after a victory that clinched the club's promotion to Division 1 in the  season's final game.  </P></p>

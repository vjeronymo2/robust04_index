			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: BOC under pressure BOC has become a victim of its own largesse. Its policy of announcing dividends in advance seemed sensible during the 1980s, but low growth and low inflation have caught the company on the hop. The pay-out has been rising faster than trading performance justified. While that helped the shares outperform through recession, the price was paid yesterday. An unexpected break in BOC's 20-year record of dividend growth - the company said next year's dividend will be unchanged - prompted another 5 per cent fall in its already sickly shares. Perhaps announcing dividends in advance is not such a good policy for the uncertain 1990s. Yet dividend cover of 1.9 times should not cause boardroom headaches at the bottom of a normal cycle. The dividend decision thus adds a further note of caution to the profits warning of the summer. Despite its reputation as an industrial bellwether, BOC has problems entirely its own. The collapse of Forane, its main anaesthetic, has been severe since US patent protection expired. Delays in introducing Suprane, the next generation anaesthetic, have added to the pain. BOC is understandably worried that more generic competitors could enter the fray. The big prize remains an upturn in industrial gases, which account for 70 per cent of sales. But gases do not rise early in the economic cycle. Other than slightly higher volumes in the US, the outlook remains unclear. While BOC's prodigious cash generation should limit the downside, it is difficult to discern the upside through the fog.</p>

			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Bringing right people to account for malpractice Sir, I fear John Mason's article ('Corporate manslaughter verdict poses legal dilemma', December 13) on corporate manslaughter following the conviction in the Lyme Bay canoe trial misses the point. Months before the disaster two instructors had written to the managing director about safety at the centre, warning that unless something was done 'you might find yourself trying to explain why someone's son or daughter will not be coming home'. At the trial, Mr Justice Ognall made it clear that it was the failure to heed this warning that separated this case from any other of its kind. No doubt it was also relevant to the managing director's jail term. If any of the five warnings about the Herald fleet sailing with bow doors open had been addressed to the managing director or board of P&amp;O, the case in the Zeebrugge prosecution might well have been put to the jury. As it was those warnings got lost in middle management. The key point, then, is with whom a serious concern is raised, rather than merely the size of the organisation. The message from this case is that an effective check on serious malpractice in the workplace is to make sure that those in charge know of it. Increasingly responsible leaders in the public and private sectors are open to such concerns and address them properly. They know it is only right that, when people in their positions have actual notice of any unwarranted dangers, they can and should expect to account for their response. If the law or good business provided otherwise, they would do little to promote the doctrine of accountability in organisations or to protect the public.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "SME-r": "Electoral Decisions of Slovak Republic </F> Citizens Who Would Definitely or Probably Participate in  Elections to the National Council of the Slovak Republic If They  Were To Be Held Today"]    [Text] Bratislava--In the first 10 days of April 1994, the  Slovak Statistical Office [SU SR] carried out its regular  monthly public opinion research. The sample (1,287 respondents)  was formed so as to correspond to the composition of the adult  population of the Slovak Republic in terms of sex, age,  nationality, level of education, size of community of residence,  and region.    The data acquired in the research suggests that citizens'  interest in participating in the early parliamentary elections  increased during the past month. Whereas in March 72 percent of  eligible voters said that they would definitely or probably  participate in the elections, their proportion in April was 76  percent.    The greatest difference between individual regions of  Slovakia as regards participation in the elections is between  Central Slovakia, where 74 percent of those questioned said that  they would definitely or probably participate in the elections  to the National Council of the Slovak Republic [NRSR], and  Bratislava, where 86 percent of respondents declared their  interest in going to the polls. Asked which political party or  movement they would vote for, those adult citizens of Slovakia  who would definitely or probably participate in the elections  replied most frequently that they would cast their vote for the  Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS].    The most striking changes compared with the preelection  situation in early March concern precisely this movement, which  has strengthened its leading position since the last poll. At  the same time, it increased its lead over the Party of the  Democratic Left [SDL], which holds second place in the  distribution of current electoral preferences.    Differences among individual regions of Slovakia regarding  the estimated electoral gains of relevant political forces are  not statistically significant in the case of the SDL, the  Alternative of Political Realism [APR], the Slovak National  Party [SNS], the Democratic Party [DS], and the Social  Democratic Party of Slovakia [SDSS]. As far as the HZDS is  concerned, support for the movement in Central Slovakia is  higher than in all other regions. Characteristic of the  Christian Democratic Movement [KDH] over the long term is its  relatively numerous electoral base in East Slovakia. In view of  the fact that approximately two-thirds of citizens declaring  themselves of Hungarian nationality will give their votes to  Hungarian political parties, the estimated electoral results of  the coalition partners Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement  [MKDH] and Coexistence in individual regions of the Slovak  Republic depend to a decisive degree on the representation of  ethnic Hungarians in the region in question.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                         |March 1994               |April 1994               |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |HZDS                     |24                       |32                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |SDL                      |14                       |13                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |KDH                      |8                        |8                        |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Coexistence/MKDH         |9                        |7                        |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |APR                      |--                       |7                        |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |SNS                      |5                        |4                        |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |DS                       |4                        |3                        |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |SDSS                     |2                        |3                        |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Green Party of Slovakia  |3                        |2                        |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Association of Workers o-|--                       |2                        |  |f Slovakia               |                         |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Alliance of Democrats    |3                        |2                        |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |National Democratic Part-|--                       |2                        |  |y-New Alternative [NDS-N-|                         |                         |  |A]                       |                         |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Other parties            |15                       |3                        |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Do not know for whom the-|13                       |12                       |  |y will vote              |                         |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Note: Data in percent                                                        |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Source: SU SR--Public Opinion Research                                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      Electoral preferences are cited only for those political  entities that would receive in April at least 1.5 percent of the  vote of adult citizens of the Slovak Republic who are either  determined to vote or will probably vote.

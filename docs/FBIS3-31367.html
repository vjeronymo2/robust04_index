			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] [Presenter] Leszek Miller and Mykhaylo Kaskevych,  ministers of labor of Poland and Ukraine, have signed an  agreement on mutual employment.    [Correspondent Magdalena Winiarczyk] The agreement, which  has  been signed for a three-year period, sets the conditions for  legal employment. Any form of employment that does not comply  with the principles of the agreement is illegal. The period of  individual employment may not be longer than 12 months and, in  exceptional circumstances, can be extended to 18 months. The  pay and working conditions for foreign employees may not be  worse than the conditions enjoyed by the citizens of each  country. This is to prevent dumping practices. Social  security, health care and legal protection are to be guaranteed  by the employing country and are to be included in consular  conventions.    Work permits are to be issued by employment offices for  specific employers and specific jobs. This principle also  concerns applications for long-stay visas, which include work  permits as well.    Ministers Leszek Miller and Mykhaylo Kaskevych have also  signed an agreement on cooperation in the area of labor and  social policy between the two countries.    [Announcer] Magdalena Winiarczyk was speaking from the  Ministry of Labor for the Midday Magazine.</p>

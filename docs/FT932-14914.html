			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / Electronic games enter a new level: What a US court victory for two giant-slayers means for Nintendo and Sega THE electronic games market is a battlefield, both on and off-screen. On-screen, Sonic the Hedgehog or Mario the plumber exchange fisticuffs with a host of enemies. Off-screen, the large manufacturers wage multi-million-dollar court actions in an effort to protect copyrights. Most take place in the US, the most lucrative market. Sometimes the giant-slayers win. Brothers Richard and David Darling, who own Codemasters, a software publisher, heard last month that the US Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal from Nintendo in an action against Lewis Galoob Toys, Codemasters' US licensee, giving them a clear victory after a two-year case. Nintendo and Sega, another Japanese company, dominate the international Pounds 9.2bn electronic games market. Nintendo was required to deposit a Dollars 15m (Pounds 9.7m) bond in the US courts. It may now be required to forfeit that bond to Lewis Galoob, Codemasters, and Camerica, a Canadian licensee of Codemasters' products. In the US case Nintendo acted against one of Codemasters' best-selling products, a copyrighted enhancer called Game Genie, which Codemasters claims has achieved international sales of Dollars 100m. It is an important victory. The managing director of one of the UK's leading retailers of electronic games is convinced that opening the door to the development of independent makers of games peripherals will be good news for both consumers and retailers. He said: 'For us, peripheral products are very important. Nintendo have always been able to fix their prices and it's really been a take-it-or-leave-it situation. Their success was due to their controlling hardware and software 100 per cent.' Nintendo is appealing against forfeiting its Dollars 15m bond, of which Dollars 3.4m is due to the Darlings, and may take their appeal all the way back to the US Supreme Court. It could be another year before the Darlings see any cash from the case. By that time legal fees, which US lawyers involved in the case say may reach Dollars 1.5m, will have eroded the final pot. But what really counts is the go-ahead in the US for Codemasters' business. The stakes in this game are high. Mr Philip Ley, marketing director of Sega Europe, says 40 per cent of homes in Japan and 30 per cent in the US have a games console. In the UK alone the electronic games market in 1992 was worth some Pounds 500m and some industry analysts estimate that could double in 1993. At the heart of the off-screen conflict are problems of definition concerning peripherals - a broad category including everything from joysticks and screen-magnifiers to game 'enhancers', which clip on to game cassettes and give the player extras, such as additional 'lives' for the central characters. The vast majority of the peripherals market is occupied by Sega and Nintendo products, so independents represent a threat to their grip on an increasingly important segment of the electronic games market. One UK retailer said: 'The only way the giants can combat the independent makers of peripherals is in the courts - and you try and find a jury which understands the technicalities of computer programming.' The main question is when is something proprietary - exclusive to the original system manufacturer - and when not? It's a very grey area and some main figures in the industry see Nintendo and Sega eventually losing their control. They expect other big Japanese electronics companies, such as Sony and Matshushita to get into games software. Both independent software producers and the large manufacturers run into conflicts because copyright laws, both in the EC and the US, are thought inadequate by some legal experts. A London-based lawyer said yesterday: 'You have difficulties applying copyright law to computer programs. When copyright law was first designed computers had never been heard of. Copyright is intended to protect an expression, not an idea. You get into very difficult questions with computer programs about what is an expression and what exactly is an idea, where the two coincide. That is what has caused a lot of the controversy.' To some extent, Nintendo and Sega have been able to grow by introducing technologically advanced hardware and feeding an apparently insatiable demand for new games. But the importance of software peripherals is set to expand. It is, industry sources say, impossible to estimate the scale of potential market, such is the rapid growth in electronic games.</p>

			<p><P> May 14, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MISPLACED HOPE OF SEDER  </P> <P> In the April 30 edition of The Times, there is a rather lengthy commentary  titled "Seder Becomes a Meal of Hope." I have had the opportunity to celebrate  Passover with my Jewish friends at the Seder, most recently at the San Diego  Community Seder. They have truly been meals of hope and freedom. However, the  tone of your article disturbs me a great deal.  </P> <P> The impression I was left with after reading the article was that the hope  provided by the Seder was the conversion of Christians to Judaism, almost  gleefully recorded. One of the most sensitive issues facing Jewish-Christian  relations is the whole problem of conversions. In my work with Jewish and  Christian -- specifically Catholic -- couples contemplating marriage, I  emphasize that the Jewish partner must, in no way, give up his or her Judaism  in order to marry a non-Jew. In fact, both are encouraged to support the other  in his or her religious belief.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, equal sensitivity is seldom reciprocated. At the recent National  Workshop for Christian-Jewish Relations in Charleston, S. C., one of the most  troubling issues was the seminar presented on intermarriage. It boiled down to  the fact that, in order for a Jew to marry a Christian, the Christian must  concede to raise the children Jewish or no marriage could take place.  Furthermore, having clergy from both traditions present was discouraged and  conversion to Judaism of the Christian was preferred. I have run across similar  mentalities in San Diego. This article in The Times reinforces this  observation.  </P> <P> If Jewish-Christian dialogue is ever to succeed, we must mutually agree to play  by the rules. Both Jews and Christians must learn to work together, accept each  other's differences, not to try to coerce conversion of the other and respect  each other's heritage, tradition and rights. This is the way each of our faith  communities can find hope; not by gloating over conversions in the newspaper.  </P> <P> THE REV. DENNIS L.

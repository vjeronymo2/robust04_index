			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Andy Gilbert] </F>   [Text] Customs officers are set to pose as computer game  customers to crack a completely new type of intellectual  property crime costing manufacturers millions of dollars a year.  New technology is being used in the territory to keep one step  ahead of law enforcers battling to keep a lid on the sale of  counterfeit computer games and the illegal copying of  programmes. The latest scam involves copying more than 100 game  programmes on to a compact disc which can in turn be copied  individually on to customers' hard disks for as little as $10 a  game. Original games can cost up to $500 each.    Previously, Customs officers raiding game stores could  easily  identify whether copying was taking place because large numbers  of hard disks containing the programme recordings were stored  there. But the new CD ROM discs, the same size as music CDs,  contain hundreds of times as much information as the older  discs. One CD ROM with hundreds of games can easily be  concealed during a customs raid.    Officers from the Customs' Intellectual Property  Investigation Bureau yesterday seized for the first time  equipment they suspected could record game programmes on to CD  ROMs. They raided a house in Kwun Tong and arrested two men  leaving the premises at 3.30 pm. Officers subsequently searched  two other homes and a private car and seized 1,128 counterfeit  game cartridges, computer chips, and a large quantity of copy  packaging valued in total at $500,000. But the bureau's deputy  head, Simon Wong Shinming, said the most significant part of the  haul was the confirmation that the counterfeiters had switched  tactics.    "We have been conducting raids on shops and had been able to  seize equipment being used for copying together with the hard  disks with the recordings on them. But recently we have not  been finding any hard disks. We couldn't understand why so we  switched our attention to the distributors."    Intelligence information led to yesterday's raid on the  distributors of CD ROMs and revealed the new tactics being used.  Mr Wong said his officers would now consider reviewing their  strategy. "We are likely to be focusing on the distributor  level or posing as customers in order to be able to hit them at  the right time," he said.    Russell Yeh, director of KPS Video Express, the largest  distributor of home entertainment software in Hong Kong, said he  estimated the industry was losing up to $3 million a month from  counterfeiting. "We need Customs to keep hitting  (counterfeiters). We know of shops that are selling copy  cartridges without even attempting to make them look like the  real thing. Their quality is not as good and we believe there  are a lot of people that would rather pay more and get the  original."</p>

			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / Insults fly from all sides in Euro-campaign The European election campaign degenerated into a slanging match yesterday as Labour dismissed the Tory manifesto as 'a tissue of lies' and Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor, said Labour policies would 'do Britain down and do Britain in'. Amid growing indications that the campaign will be one of the dirtiest on record, Labour also accused the Conservatives of seeking to exploit racial tensions and breaking promises in its last European manifesto. Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, accused the Conservatives of putting long-term British interests in jeopardy and lampooned Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, as the government's 'perennial Jeeves'. Addressing a rally in the south-west, Mr Ashdown said Mr Hurd's efforts to reconcile the Conservative party's deep divisions on Europe had made his actions 'more and more distant from what we know he believes in'. The exchanges were in sharp contrast to the decorous debate in the week after the death of John Smith when politicians on all sides called for a less confrontational style. Mr Jack Cunningham, shadow foreign secretary, said the Conservative manifesto contained 26 lies about Labour, including claims that it would ease immigration controls and abandon Britain's veto in the Council of Ministers. He accused Mr John Major, the prime minister, of pandering to xenophobic cabinet ministers, and described him as 'a junkie hooked on Tory Central Office lies'. He said it was difficult to recall a party document as 'mendacious' as the Tory manifesto, and warned: 'This is a prime minister and a government that will lie whenever they think it will be to their political advantage.' Mr Jack Straw, shadow environment secretary, said the Conservative allegations about Labour's immigration proposals contrasted sharply with the government's decision to allow wealthy foreigners to bypass immigration controls. 'It is a nice irony that they are playing the race card on the same day that they are giving the green light to drug barons to come into the country,' he said. Mr Clarke claimed that Labour would undermine British sovereignty by abandoning the British veto on European Union tax and immigration initiatives. Labour has denied that it would abandon the veto in 'areas of key national interest', although its manifesto envisages greater use of qualified majority voting on social and environmental matters. Sir Norman Fowler, Conservative party chairman, said the Liberal Democrat manifesto committed Mr Ashdown's party to abolishing Britain's veto in Europe and introducing comprehensive EU rules on immigration. In the Commons, Mrs Margaret Beckett, acting Labour leader, drew attention to a pledge in the Conservative manifesto for the 1989 European election, which ruled out the imposition of value added tax on domestic fuel and power. Mr Major accused Labour politicians of 'trying to duck and dodge and weave because they know the British people will not stand for their policies on Europe'. Sir David Steel, the Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesman, last night issued an emphatic statement of his party's traditional federalist stance, John Authers writes. He said in St Ives, Cornwall, that the EU would be 'stultified' if it did not abandon the national veto in favour of qualified majority voting. 'Are we really so un-self-confident in the new community of 16 that we worry all the time we are going to find ourselves so isolated on an item of policy that we stand alone?' he asked. Federalism, he said, would mean devolving all European decisions to the lowest level possible.</p>

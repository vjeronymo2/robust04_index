			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / Japan to ask US to curb budget deficit MR MORIHIRO HOSOKAWA, Japan's prime minister, plans to ask the US to curb its budget deficit and improve industrial competitiveness when he meets President Bill Clinton next Monday. He told parliament in a policy speech yesterday: 'Our country will strive to achieve non-inflationary economic growth based on domestic demand and improve access to its markets. At the same time, (Japan) will ask the US to cut its budget deficit and boost its international competitive edge.' Mr Hosokawa will meet the US president for their first summit after addressing the United Nations general assembly in New York. This will be scrutinised closely by the Japanese public as the first test of the new prime minister's statesmanship and his ability to stand up to the US. Relations between Washington and Tokyo are becoming sensitive again as they enter the second week of talks on trade and economic co-operation, clouded by a fresh spate of scandals over alleged bid-rigging in Japan's construction industry. His speech, Mr Hosokawa's second policy statement in the Diet, the lower house of parliament, was designed to set the tone for a 90-day special session to debate political reform, due to end on December 15. He repeated his pledge to push through plans to reform the corruption-prone political system by the end of the year and to pursue plans to reform Japan's administration and deregulate the economy. He used the occasion to underline the wider importance of political reform to Japan's place in the world. 'Japan has been beset with the scandal of political corruption virtually every year and the spectacle of the Diet in a frenzy trying to deal with these scandals has not only exacerbated distrust of politics but even threatens to undermine Japan's international credibility.' On deregulation, he argued it was vital to pass on benefits of Japan's economic power to ordinary people. Mr Hosokawa expressed the highest respect for those who worked single-mindedly since the end of the war to achieve economic and industrial growth.</p>

Martonyi arrived for a visit to Poland on Saturday [19  March]  to open the Hungarian Consulate in Krakow, for the time being  only a symbol, as actual work will begin later. The state  secretary said the main aim of his visit was to hold  consultations with senior officials from the Polish Foreign  Ministry, mainly in an effort to coordinate European integration  policy.    "The reason is that we consider Polish-Hungarian cooperation  to be of strategic importance, and this remains key to the whole  of the region," Martonyi said.    Talks with Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski and his  assistants, and with members of Polish Parliament's Foreign  Affairs and European Relations Committees, served this end, as  well as the furthering of bilateral relations.    Martonyi said that like the Hungarian, Polish foreign policy  also considers the Visegrad cooperation (between Poland, Czech  Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary) to be alive and important. The  free trade zone taking shape creates a good basis for developing  relations in other areas as well.</p>

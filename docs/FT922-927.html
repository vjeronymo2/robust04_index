			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / International Company News: Pirelli to sell bedding unit to Suez offshoot PIRELLI, the loss-making Italian tyres and cables concern, yesterday announced it had agreed the first of a series of disposals aimed at lowering its debts and speeding a return to profitability, writes Haig Simonian. The group is selling for L41.9bn (Dollars 35m) its bedding activities, one of the seven business units in the diversified products division now up for sale. The transaction, which involves one of the smallest business units under the hammer, will realise an extraordinary gain of L25.4bn for the parent company. The bedding business, which makes beds, mattresses and associated textile products, has a turnover of around L100bn. The disposal should ease the Pirelli group's net indebtedness by around L63bn, it said. The business is being bought by Overseas Partners International and Eurosuez, an offshoot of the French Suez banking group.</p>

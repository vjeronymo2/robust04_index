			<p><P> January 11, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MESSAGE IS CLEAR: GOVERNOR WANTS YEAR-ROUND SCHOOLS  </P> <P> When it comes to year-round schools, Gov. George Deukmejian's proposed state  budget contains few specifics and very little new money, but it sends a clear  political message that the state's fiscally conservative chief executive wants  California schools off the traditional summer-break calendar.  </P> <P> "We're not exactly sure of the specifics of this, but I think the message is  clear: he wants us to move in that direction," Bill Honig, state superintendent  of public instruction, said Wednesday.  </P> <P> "The governor has never taken such a strong position in use of facilities  year-round. It's his boldest, strongest statement to date," said Charles  Ballinger, executive director of the National Assn. for Year-Round Education.  </P> <P> Referring to a continuing explosion in school enrollment, Deukmejian in his  State of the State address Monday proposed three steps pushing the state toward  year-round schools.  </P> <P> Saying California schools cannot afford to "depend simply on building our way  out of the shortage of classrooms," Deukmejian proposed increasing incentives  to districts that switch to multitrack, year-round calendars that ensure that  classrooms do not sit idle for weeks at a time.  </P> <P> His package also includes allocating slightly more money to reward districts  that have multitrack, year-round schools and loosening requirements for voter  approval of local bond measures to build year-round schools. He also proposed  giving districts with year-round schools priority in tapping the state's pool  of school construction funds, a plan similar to an existing law.  </P> <P> It is unclear what effect the governor's proposals will have on the Los Angeles  Unified School District, where year-round schools are being hotly debated as  the district struggles to cope with massive overcrowding. About 23% of the  district's 610,000 students already attend year-round schools, contrasted with  only 9% of students statewide.  </P> <P> The district last year received a whopping $21 million of the $30 million  bestowed on California schools as part of the incentive program to switch to  year-round. This year, the governor proposed raising the pool to $43 million --  but he also wants to change the allocation formula in a way that could hurt Los  Angeles.  </P> <P> The current formula is tipped in favor of big, crowded districts, but both the  state legislative analyst's office and some members of the Legislature have  criticized the program, which pays up to $150 per student.  </P> <P> In Los Angeles, most of the money is eaten up by increased costs of operating  schools year-round, but approximately $50 per student is available to  individual schools to use for whatever educational programs they choose.  </P> <P> Gary Jerome, an aide to state Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach), who plans  to introduce legislation to change the formula, said Los Angeles has the most  to lose.  </P> <P> "It's going to be hard to get a change because of the size of the Los Angeles  delegation (in the Legislature), but if the governor is behind it, it improves  the chances," Bergeson said.  </P> <P> The governor's support for year-round schools may also give the concept  credibility beyond those education leaders that have been pushing for it.  </P> <P> "If year-round is going to be a viable program, people have to view it  differently," said Ron Prescott, a lobbyist for the Los Angeles district. "The  governor talking about it will change the perceptions of it over time.  </P></p>

			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / IMF agrees to Manila targets The Philippines yesterday won International Monetary Fund approval for a request to raise ceilings on the country's monetary growth while keeping its programme for economic expansion on track. The agreement removes a big obstacle in the current IMF review of the country's compliance with economic performance targets to enable it to draw the second tranche of the Dollars 648m (Pounds 415m) credit support for the economic programme. A visiting IMF technical team had initially rejected the Philippine debt negotiators' request, which led Mr Cielito Habito, the socio-economic planning secretary, to remark that Manila should abandon the Fund's programme if the new monetary target is not allowed. The threat, however, was contradicted later by Mr Gabriel Singson, governor of the central bank, who insisted that the IMF programme was still needed by the country. Mr Singson is head of the negotiating panel with the IMF. Under the programme, approved only in June, base money (money held by banks and the public plus banks' deposits with the central bank) is to grow by 13 per cent next year to about 3.5 per cent of gross national product. The Philippines asked that the growth rate be allowed to increase to 16 per cent, because of a recent surge in base money levels which was traced to increased levels of foreign exchange flows into the country. following the improved investment climate. Philippine officials are confident that the economy could grow by up to 6.5 per cent next year, against 5 per cent earlier projected. This year the growth rate is forecast at about 5.5 per cent  - the best since 1989  - compared with the target of 3.5 to 4.5 per cent under the IMF programme. So far, growth has been bolstered by strong investment and exports, although independent economists fear that a large trade deficit, if unchecked, could derail this. The IMF mission ends its visit on Friday.</p>

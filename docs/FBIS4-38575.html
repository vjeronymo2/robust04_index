			<p>BFN     [Text] Azerbaijani State Aide Arif Ragimzade proposed that  high-ranking members of the opposition People's Front be removed  from the parliament. This concerned former foreign minister  Tofik Gasymov and First Deputy Chairman of the People's Front  Ibrahim Ibrahimov.    Ragimzade proposed it this morning when the parliament was  discussing the social-political situation in Azerbaijan on the  initiative of Speaker Rasul Guliyev. The situation in  Azerbaijan has become more tense due to the opposition  protesting the position of the authorities on the settlement in  Nagorno-Karabakh.    Azerbaijani Interior Minister Ramil Usubov laid the  responsibility for the situation at the door of leader of the  National Independence opposition party Etibar Mamedov.    In his turn, Mamedov blamed Usubov for misinformation of the  Azerbaijani leadership and for actions of the police which, in  his mind, were undermining stability in the country.    Former foreign minister Gasymov said that Speaker Guliyev  was  triggering off the tension since Guliyev had refused to discuss  the Bishkek protocol on settlement in Karabakh in the  parliament. This made the opposition take action.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 9 (KCNA) -- The Asian Regional  Committee to Support Korea's Reunification condemned the perfidy  of the United States in totally reversing the agreed conclusions  reached at the DPRK-U.S. contact in New York.    In its statement March 28, the committee said the U.S. act  at  a decisive moment with the solution of the nuclear issue at hand  clearly proved that it was still pursuing a double-dealing  policy of resorting to a war scheme and threat to socialist  Korea while having talks with the latter.    Pointing out that the United States is manoeuvring to  isolate  and stifle Korea, cashing in on talks, negotiation and "nuclear  inspection", the statement demanded that it immediately withdraw  from South Korea with all its nuclear weapons and allow an  overall inspection of its nuclear weapons in South Korea.    Secretary General of the Committee, Om Prakash Mantri, sent  protest letters to the U.S. President and the South Korean chief  executive.    The letters demanded that the United States take an  effective  measure for the implementation of the agreed conclusions,  squarely looking at the realities, and the South Korean  authorities stop obeying to its orders.    The committee published on March 29 an appeal to political  parties and public organizations and peaceloving people in Asia,  calling upon the peaceloving people of Asia and the rest of the  world to wage a vigorous struggle against the perfidy of the  United States.</p>

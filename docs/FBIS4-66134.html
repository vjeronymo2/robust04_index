			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "14.7 Percent Polled in Favor of </F> Berlusconi as King"]    [Text] (ANSA) Milan, May 19 -- Asked if they would like to  see Premier and Forza Italia leader Silvio Berlusconi as king of  Italy, 14.7 percent of the 1,016 Italians questioned by Directa  pollsters via telephone over a three-day period (May 16, 17 and  18) said "yes." The pollsters, who questioned a sample of adult  men and women from 95 cities and towns throughout the country,  made the results known today.    Among those most in favor of Berlusconi as king were those  living on the islands (27.8 percent) and in the south (19.2),  persons over the age of 54 (20.1), those having little formal  education (23.1), practicing Catholics (20.7), and housewives  (more than one in four, while a little over half were against).    Among those opposed to "King Silvio" were those living in  the  northeast (89.7 percent), students (92.8), industrialists,  business executives and professionals (89.3), diplomats and  college graduates (85.2) and males, in general (79.5).    Out of the total polled, 74.1 percent responded, while 11.2  percent said they had no opinion on the matter of Berlusconi as  king.</p>

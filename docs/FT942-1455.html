			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / Clinton's team breathes easy at N Korea accord: George Graham reports on a sense of relief in Washington that there was a third way to resolve a thorny foreign affairs issue Enormous relief was expressed in Washington yesterday at the emergence of an agreement with North Korea that would freeze Pyongyang's nuclear programme and pave the way for talks in Geneva next month. Clinton administration officials had adopted a wait-and-see approach after former president Jimmy Carter returned from Pyongyang last week with an offer that apparently met US conditions for resuming talks. When official confirmation finally arrived on Wednesday, it allowed the US to embrace Mr Carter's deal, a third option far more palatable than the policies of economic sanctions or military action which appeared a week ago to be all that remained. The pursuit of economic sanctions at the United Nations never seemed very promising. North Korea's limited economic links with the rest of the world made it largely immune to such economic pressure, in the unlikely event that neighbouring China would agree to a strong sanctions resolution. The option of bombing North Korea's nuclear facilities, advocated by several senior officials from the administration of former President George Bush, though in the more clinical language of 'eliminating reprocessing capacity', carried with it the possibility of provoking at least some counter-attack on South Korea, if not a full-blown second Korean war. It remains to be seen how complete the victory will prove to be. North Korea's President Kim Il-sung may have folded, but poker rules allow him to keep his cards concealed, and the truth about nuclear fuel extracted in the past may now never be established. For an apparent success, however, the US's achievement in getting Pyongyang to agree to a freeze on its nuclear development was greeted with an unusual degree of criticism. Why did the White House not come up on its own with Mr Carter's blindingly simple idea of talking directly to President Kim? Was it the White House's failure to brief Mr Carter properly that led him to say prematurely last week that the drive for sanctions had been called off? Why did President Clinton appear over the weekend to disown Mr Carter, only to embrace him again on Wednesday when he received confirmation from Pyongyang that the deal did indeed correspond with what the former president had announced? These were the questions being asked. White House officials were irked by the carping tone with which their announcement was received. 'When we have just had a positive step forward, I find it strange to speculate on how we messed it, so I'll try to get my mind around that,' sniffed one senior administration official. The whole episode, coming on the heels of about-turns and waverings on China, Haiti and half a dozen other international problems, has reinforced the image of Mr Clinton's foreign policy team as 'the gang that couldn't shoot straight'. The criticism may be unfair, but at the least, the Clinton team is the gang whose every shot is going to be viewed as astray by a White House press corps whose binoculars are trained firmly on the trigger finger, not on the target.</p>

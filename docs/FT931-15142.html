			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Owners Abroad bid referral urged to avert travel duopoly AIRTOURS' hostile Pounds 215m bid for rival holiday company, Owners Abroad, has met the first signs of formal opposition from consumer groups and smaller tour operators. The Consumers' Association is today writing to the Office of Fair Trading requesting referral of the bid to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. At the same time, Mr Noel Josephides, chairman of the Association of Independent Tour Operators, has warned that 'the future of the travel industry under a duopoly will be grim.' He is particularly concerned about the future of Air 2000, Owners Abroad's charter airline which, if absorbed by Airtours he argues, would reduce the number of carriers available for smaller tour companies. 'This will be a serious blow to the independent tour operator and will lead to further lack of choice and eventual control of the industry by one or two major players,' Mr Josephides said. If the bid succeeded, Airtours share of the UK market would approach the 33 per cent controlled by Thomson, which has dominated the industry for more than a decade. Mr Derek Prentice, assistant director of the Consumers' Association, said he was less than optimistic that the bid would be referred to the MMC, given that recent UK competition policy had been 'cloudy'. But the referral was being requested on the grounds that Airtours would have between 27 and 30 per cent of the holiday tour market, above the 25 per cent figure that normally triggers an MMC investigation. Airtours is not expecting the bid to be referred. It investigated the likelihood of such a move before bidding. Mr Josephides, whose organisation represents about 120 independent travel groups, was also downbeat about the state of the holiday tour market. 'There is a mood of caution and pessimism in this, the most naively optimistic of industries,' he said. 'The prices being charged for 1993 holidays are artificially and dangerously low.' Meanwhile, it emerged that Sir Michael Bishop, chairman of British Midland Airways and a non-executive director of Airtours, holds 58,096 shares in Owners Abroad. The holding should have been declared when Airtours announced its bid last week.</p>

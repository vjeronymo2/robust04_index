			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / Body Shop's recovery beats forecast BODY Shop International, the natural cosmetics and toiletries manufacturer and retailer, is reaping the benefits of its tighter grip on the business with interim pre-tax profits up from Pounds 8.3m to Pounds 10m, ahead of market expectations of Pounds 9m to Pounds 9.3m. The shares rose 13p to 188p. Balance sheet gearing fell from 53 to 24 per cent, at the end of August, with net debt at Pounds 21.6m. Body Shop has also sold its 65.6 per cent stake in Eastwick Trading, which operates franchised shops in the Benelux countries and Austria, for Pounds 2.1m. Dr Jan Oosterwijk, who runs Eastwick, has resigned from the board but will remain a consultant. It is also paying Pounds 3.86m to end the earn-out for management of its Cos-Tec cosmetic manufacturing subsidiary, acquired in 1991. Mr Gordon Roddick, chairman, said the earn-out was raising conflicts and it would be cheaper to buy it out now rather than later. Mr Gordon Roddick, chairman, said the results reflected growth in the international business and 'an improving trading pattern in the UK'. The interim dividend is being raised by 10 per cent to 0.75p, which he said indicated the group's confidence that 'we think we know where we are going'. He added: 'I am happier today than I was a year ago.' Then the group issued a profit warning and the shares fell heavily. Mr Roddick said Mr Geoff Marshall, appointed UK retail director in May, had made a significant impact in a short time, introducing new products and organising the business better. Like-for-like sales were down 5 per cent in the UK in the first half, but this was lower than the 8 per cent seen in the second half of the previous year and was continuing to improve. Budgets for this Christmas season assume flat comparable sales. UK sales rose 6.9 per cent to Pounds 37.4m, although price increases were 'minimal' and operating profits were up 5 per cent to Pounds 3.9m. The group opened four shops in the UK, taking the total to 237. The small increase 'signals the transition of the Body Shop into a mature retailer in the UK,' Mr Roddick said. The chain was approaching 'critical mass' in the US with 140 shops. Sales there rose 77.7 per cent to Pounds 19.9m and operating profits were up from Pounds 800,000 to Pounds 1.3m. Sales from the rest of the world rose 21.4 per cent to Pounds 25.5m, with operating profits up 8 per cent to Pounds 5.5m. Interest charges fell from Pounds 1.3m to Pounds 700,000. Earnings per share were 3.4p, up from 2.9p. Lex, Page 22</p>

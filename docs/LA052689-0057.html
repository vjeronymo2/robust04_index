			<p><P> May 26, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: ART  </P> <P> A state Assembly subcommittee voted Wednesday to restore a $3-million cut  proposed by Gov. George Deukmejian for the $15.6-million budget of the  California Arts Council. Contrary to what was widely anticipated, the  subcommittee did not recommend that the council trim its administration budget,  but it did request studies about how the arts agency awards grants. A Senate  subcommittee has recommended the same budget restoration, also voting for an  additional $2.2 million for the council. The matter now goes before a joint  legislative committee, then to Deukmejian, who will sign the entire state  budget into law in July. CLAUDIA PUIG  </P></p>

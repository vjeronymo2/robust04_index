			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Joint news conference with Italian Prime Minister Silvio </F> Berlusconi and U.S. President Bill Clinton in Rome on 2 June --  live]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Correspondent Helen Thomas,  in English with simultaneous Italian translation] I would like  you to tell the president why so many people think that your  government is leaning toward fascism. In your statement, you  spoke about greater intervention in world crises. Do you want  to send troops into Bosnia to fight in that country?    [Berlusconi] I can tell you what is actually happening in  Italy and in my government. In Italy, there is no nostalgia for  a period that we consider to be buried in the past and condemned  by history. All the surveys that have been carried out on this  issue have shown that less than 1 percent of Italians -- the  last survey said exactly 0.4 percent of Italians - have what  could be termed nostalgia, and perhaps that is even going a bit  far, for fascism. So this problem does not exist and has nothing  to do with the real state of affairs. Moreover, the government  that I head and which is made up of the ministers I chose does  not contain, nor could it ever contain, any minister who is not  a democratic minister, any minister who does not believe in  freedom and democracy or who does not believe that  totalitarianism must always be fought.    As to the second part of your question, we have discussed  the  possibility of international organizations taking more effective  action in the future. Concerning specific situations in the  world -- the former Yugoslavia is one, but there is also Rwanda,  and other situations in Africa, of which Somalia is an example  -- a great deal has been done. When they see all these tragic  scenes on television, all our people ask themselves whether  enough has been done. I know that it is not easy to find  solutions, and I do not think anyone believes that by simply  sending in troops things can be solved. Nevertheless, I believe  that the international organizations must pay the utmost  attention to what is happening in the world so that through  diplomatic action they can prevent potential crises from  developing and giving rise to many disasters, much pain and  suffering. Above all, I believe that everything must be done to  prevent a wound from becoming a permanent and incurable ulcer  and a a continuous cause of pain and suffering. [passage  omitted]    [Unidentified correspondent] Could I ask Mr. Berlusconi  something? Since any judgement about the government must be  based on concrete facts, we would like to know which measures  will be put before parliament first and most urgently, and how  does he intend to move in the Senate, where he only has a very  narrow majority? Also, I would like to ask President Clinton  what he thinks about the possibility of Italian troops  participating in the UN mission in former Yugoslavia -- whether  or not he agrees with this.    [Berlusconi] I do not believe that we should bore our guests  with matters concerning domestic politics, which have already  been explained several times in the presentations of the  government's manifesto to the Senate and in the replies to  questions in the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies. We know  very well that we are waiting for a relaunch of the economy and  for growth and that we must tackle the central problem of  creating new jobs. We will proceed in this direction, and let  me say that on this matter I can clearly remember what President  Clinton said in Detroit a few months ago, when he stated that  the employment problem could not be solved by state  intervention, but that the state should encourage private  initiative, which is the real engine and can create new jobs. I  also remember that on that occasion he outlined what he thought  were the best ways of tackling the problem and specifically that  of a different relationship between man and work. In other  words, a different way of looking at the changing face of work  to achieve greater flexibility in the labor market -- and a  determined effort on everyone's part to improve training. We  are following the very same line, and we are already making  changes, because this government has restored confidence to  business, to the many millions of Italian businessman on whom  our particular kind of wealth is based and who would have felt  let down by other governments, but who now have the promise of  intervention to support them, of various measures, of a tax  truce, and above all have the promise to change the stance of  the machinery of politics and bureaucracy toward those who take  risks and do business, who have already started again and who  are looking with trust and optimism to the future of their  companies. I believe that is what we should worry about doing  and it is what we are already doing.    As for the second part of the question, I am not at all  worried because certain committees appointed chairpersons who do  not belong to the majority parties. I believe that the road is  long, and I continue to be optimistic -- I still think that the  minority parties have accepted the outcome of the election and  the Italians' desire for a working government and that the  minority parties will not want to be destructive or to hinder  government, but that they intend to judge policies individually,  for the good of the country. The minority parties will be  vigilant, careful, and will analyse things, but they will work  for and not against government.</p>

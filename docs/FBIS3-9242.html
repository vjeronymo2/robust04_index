			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Arrest of Albanians -- Political </F> Case"]    [Text] In reference to the latest arrests of Albanian  citizens, the Albanian People's Democratic Party appealed to all  government bodies to order an urgent release of all citizens  imprisoned in this political and fabricated process.    They warn the government has an obligation to treat this  case  in the same way it did similar attempts by certain Macedonians  to organise themselves. Otherwise, they say the Macedonian  Government takes on a responsibility for possible worsening of  the situation in the country, which is something Macedonia  [FYROM -- The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia] needs the  least at the moment.</p>

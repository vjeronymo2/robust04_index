			<p><P> October 7, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> One of my favorite shows, "The Young Riders," was pulled from its time slot in  mid-season.  </P> <P> It was given little advertising but found an audience and started to move up  (in the ratings) when it was replaced by "Twin Peaks." Due to a lot of hype and  marketing by ABC, this "innovative" "Peaks" series with its "brilliant  director" had good ratings in the beginning, but interest dwindled. "The  Riders" survived to a second season. But as the Emmys passed "Peaks" by, I  wondered: What was all the fuss about?  </P> <P> Anathea Lopez, Baldwin Park  </P></p>

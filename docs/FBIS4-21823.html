			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Evren Deger: ``Initiative To Establish a Kurdish </F> Red Crescent Society'' -- all punctuation as published]    [Text] Ankara--The Kurdish Workers Party [PKK] has made an  initiative to establish a Kurdish Red Crescent Society in  Greece. It has been ascertained that Hasan Dag, head of ERNK  [Kurdish People's Liberation Front], which is the PKK's  political wing, and Retired Admiral Andonios Naksakis, who  facilitates PKK's activities in Greece, appealed to the  Governor's Office in Athens to approve the establishment of the  society. It has been reported that the society will be based in  building No. 72 on Ipokratis Street in Athens if the appeal is  approved.    Turkish officials have been informed that the Governor's  Office has not yet responded to the PKK's appeal. However, they  assessed the initiative as being aimed at ``facilitating  Greece's financial aid to the PKK by having ERNK recognized by  the Greek Government.'' Stressing that the approval of the  appeal for the establishment of that society for humanitarian  purposes will create an opportunity for Greece to support the  PKK more easily, the officials said: ``The realization of their  project will facilitate Greece's contacts with the PKK through  that society, which will supposedly be a humanitarian  establishment. Consequently, Greece will find it easier to  resist international reaction.''    It is common knowledge that Greece has given material aid to  the PKK and allowed it to establish camps in that country for a  long time. The file that was submitted to Prime Minister Tansu  Ciller on the PKK in December 1993 said that Greece paid 30,000  drachmas monthly to ERNK members. It also said that Greece has  supplied ``Aris'' antitank missiles to the PKK and deposited 100  drachmas in the National Bank for each PKK member. The file  informed Ciller that Greece provided $10,000,000 for the PKK in  the form of aid in accordance with former Foreign Minister  Andonios Samaras' instructions. Meanwhile, the PKK received  another $1,000,000 to undermine tourism in Turkey.    The file also informed Ciller as follows:    A. The Lavrion refugee camp, which is 70 km southeast of  Athens, has been given to the PKK. PKK activities in Greece are  carried out by ERNK and the Kurdistan Committee in Athens.    B. An account has been opened in the Kaningos branch of the  National Bank of Greece for PKK members in the Lavrion camp.  The account number is 129/62639077. PKK members Samil Asmaad  and Sinan Aslan are responsible for the affairs of Kurds in  Greece.    C. The radio channel known as ``Phonitou Kourdhistan''  [Voice  of Kurdistan] is operated by the PKK in Greece.    D. The Greek Ministry of Foreign Affairs has given  scholarships to 33 PKK members in Greece.</p>

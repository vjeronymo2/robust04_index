			<p><P> September 29, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> GRANADA HILLS' WASHINGTON RUNS DEEPER INTO THE BOOK  </P> <P> Each year, the Granada Hills High football program is updated to include  records set the previous year. The 1990 program was circulated Thursday night  as the Highlanders prepared to play their home opener.  </P> <P> In one game, fullback Brett Washington rendered it obsolete.  </P> <P> In addition to shattering four single-game school records in Granada Hills'  48-7 defeat of Compton, Washington also set three career marks and moved within  an eyelash of a fourth. The first mark was obliterated the first time  Washington touched the ball: The 6-foot, 220-pound senior raced 93 yards for a  touchdown.  </P> <P> "The safety was 10 yards downfield when (Washington) broke through the line and  Brett ran by him like he wasn't even there," Granada Hills co-Coach Darryl  Stroh said. "By the time he reached the end zone he was 10-15 yards ahead of  everyone else."  </P> <P> The run eclipsed a record that Washington had shared with Kurt Schumacher,  whose 89-yard run against Bell in 1974 had been the longest. Washington tied  the mark in Granada Hills' season opener.  </P> <P> "He is so explosive," Stroh said.  </P> <P> The particulars of a dynamite night follow:  </P> <P> * Washington's 252 yards rushing broke the single-game mark of 218 set by  Khalid Ali in 1986 against Westlake.  </P> <P> * His five rushing touchdowns broke Ali's single-game mark of four set against  Westlake in the same 1986 game.  </P> <P> * His 30 points broke Greg Fowble's single-game record of 28 set against Van  Nuys in 1985.  </P> <P> * Washington passed Ali (2,062 yards from 1985-86) as the career rushing  leader. Washington has 2,216 yards in 25 games.  </P> <P> * With his five touchdowns, he broke two Ali career scoring marks. Washington  now has 27 rushing touchdowns, besting Ali's mark by three. Washington, who  entered the game tied with Ali with 27 career touchdowns, now has 31. Before  the night was over, five of Ali's records had been KOd.  </P> <P> There was also a near-miss. Washington has scored 186 points in his 25-game  career, one point shy of the career mark set by receiver-kicker Fowble in  1984-85.  </P> <P> Washington also holds the school record for average yards per carry at 7.5, set  last season.  </P> <P> "It's nice to see him have that kind of success," Stroh said. "He's a  sweetheart of a kid."  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Majles deputies Qorban 'Ali </F> Dorri-Najafabandi, Mohammad Reza Bahonar, Morteza Nabavi, and  Mohsen Yahyavi, by unidentified Central News Unit parliamentary  correspondent; date not given -- recorded]    [Text] [Correspondent] Following the approval of the  General Budget Bill of the country for the year 1373 [starting  21 March] by the Islamic Consultative Majles and its approval by  the Guardian Council, we have interviewed a number of Majles  deputies and the chairmen of specialized committees about the  major aspects and characteristics of this bill. Concerning the  changes which have been made in next year's budget, [Qorban  'Ali] Dorri-Najafabadi, chairman of the Plan and Budget  Committee of the Islamic Consultative Majles, said:    [Dorri-Najafabadi] In the first instance, the changes which  were made were changes in the revenue which constituted a major  change between the bill approved by the Majles and the bill  presented by the government. There was nearly a change of 380  billion tumans [each tuman is 10 rials] in the general sector.  If you add to this the government owned companies, the figure  will show a difference of 1,000 billion tumans between the  figure approved by the Majles and the figure presented by the  government in the budget bill. In other words, the figure  approved by the Majles is less than that proposed by the  government. Of course, certain mechanisms have been instituted  so that if certain incomes were received by the government as  part of their revenue the government would be able to cater for  it.    The next change which we introduced in this connection, is  stressing and changing the ratio of the revenue [as heard]. We  have made major changes in the revenue from taxation, especially  the revenue from customs duty and commercial benefit tax [sud-e  bazargani]. This was a positive change in the direction of  supporting the domestic products of the country. First of all,  we have introduced some savings in the current sector, between 7  percent and 13 percent [as heard]. We have made subsidies  universal, so that in the coming year the government will  provide subsidies for essential goods and medicine as far as it  can and which can be sustained by the present conditions.    We have taken good steps concerning deprived areas, above  the  ceiling set by the government budget. Although we have reduced  the budget by 380 billion tumans, we have not reduced the  ceiling. On the contrary, we have provided greater assistance,  we have increased the amount in this budget.    [Correspondent] Mohammad Reza Bahonar, deputy from Tehran  and  spokesman of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Majles,  also concerning the main elements of the budget and mechanisms  for preventing an increase in prices and controlling inflation  believes:    [Bahonar] To be able to balance our revenue with our  expenditure, we have put some pressure on some unnecessary  government expenditures. In one sentence, if we are going to  move toward a policy of balancing the budget we should achieve a  balance between general demand and general supply. Demand has  two main sources: From the government sector and from the  people. So far, the pressure has been placed on reducing the  public demand by increasing prices. However, alongside reducing  public demand, we can at least reduce the demand by the  government to some extent. This can be done by reducing  government expenditure. If the government demand is reduced at  least to the level of the reduction in public demand, the  situation of expenditure will be improved in favor of the  people. I think that if we wish to define in one word the  characteristics of the 1373 budget compared to previous budgets,  we should say that it can be summarized as:    1. Being more realistic about our revenue;    2. Reducing expenditure on the basis of our revenue;    3. Concentrating these reductions in unnecessary  expenditures. Where the expenditure has been necessary not only  have we not reduced it, on the contrary we have even increased  it.    Another important issue that we can see in the budget is the  issue of supervising and controlling bank credits. For the  first time, we have defined bank credits and we have allocated  55 percent of banking loans and credits to the people. In  controlling inflation -- the most important reason for which is  the increase of cash in circulation [roshd-e naqdinegi] -- we  have controlled this increase in circulation for the coming  year. In technical language, we have limited the growth in  banking facilities to 7,000 billion rials [roshd-e mande-ye  tashilat-e banki ra dar mahdudeh-ye haft hezar milliar rial  motevaqqef kardim]. If this increase is brought under control,  and God willing it will be controlled, we hope that next year  the growth in our cash flow will be about 15 percent. The  increase in Gross National Product should also be calculated,  and these two will determine how much is going to be the  increase in our inflation.    [Correspondent] Regarding some of the directions,  specifics, and also the effects of the rial's exchange rate on  the amount of foreign currency allocated to subsidize essential  goods, Morteza Nabavi, a representative of the people of Tehran  said the following:    [Nabavi] Since no mechanism has been thought of to cushion  the poor members of society against the effects of an increase  in the price of gasoline and other oil products, the Majles did  not agree to raise the prices of these products. This was  welcomed by the people. An increase in the price of these  products without a program to neutralize the effects of this on  the life of the oppressed would have increased pressure on the  people.    Last year, the amount of currency allocated to subsidizing  essential goods was worked out at the exchange rate of seven  tumans to the dollar. [Words indistinct] This year, the currency  allocated to subsidizing essential goods was worked out at 175  tumans. The rial for this has been predicted so that payment  can be made [as heard]. As a result, as far as the people are  concerned, the price of essential goods reaching them will not  change. In other words, the price at which rationed essential  goods were offered to the people through coupons this year will  not change next year.    [Correspondent] The topic of income generated through the  sale of oil and other related issues were addressed by Mohsen  Yahyavi, a deputy from Tehran and the head of the Oil Committee  of the Islamic Consultative Majles:    [Yahyavi] The psychological and technical factors that  affect  the production of oil, and also the price of oil, were assessed  by the Majles during its debate on the budget bill. In the end,  what the Majles approved, that is for the ceiling of income from  oil sales for the year 1373, was $10.154 billion. This is  nearly $1.646 billion less than the income predicted by the  government. We are now able to provide most of the raw materials  of our factories. There is less need than before for currency to  obtain such materials.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Roundup" by Xie Dongfeng: "'Arafat's Remark Sparks </F> Controversy in Israel"]    [Text] Jerusalem, May 19 (XINHUA) -- The Palestine  Liberation Organization (PLO) Chairman Yasir 'Arafat's call for  Islamic jihad (holy war) to liberate Jerusalem has sparked sharp  controversy in Israel's political spheres.    Last week, 'Arafat spoke in a mosque in South Africa that  "you have to come and launch jihad to liberate Jerusalem, your  third shrine."    Under pressure from Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres,  'Arafat clarified his statement Wednesday at a press conference  in Oslo by saying that he meant "peaceful jihad."    'Arafat promised to crusade for peace and reassured Israel  that he had urged Moslems to wage a holy war for Jerusalem only  in a religious sense.    However, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin did not accept  'Arafat's such clarification Wednesday, saying it was  "far-fetched."    Rabin said here that 'Arafat's call for jihad was making the  peace process with the Palestinians more difficult and would  continue to do so in the future.    Both 'Arafat and Peres attended a ceremony organized by the  Atlanta-based Jimmy Carter Center honoring Norway's contribution  to the Middle East peace process.    After hearing 'Arafat's clarification, Peres said that "this  was the minimum that I expected to hear, the situation was not  simple. This is what was needed, or else, I would not have come."    Earlier, Peres boycotted a lunch with 'Arafat, saying he  would not attend a joint event until 'Arafat issued a clarifying  statement.    On Tuesday, Rabin said that the future of the peace process  will come into question unless 'Arafat clarifies his call for  jihad.    If this statement is repeated, Rabin said, "this would be a  clear violation of a basic element of the continuation of the  process."    "Therefore, we will ask for a clarification, and there is no  doubt in my mind, Israel will not be able to accept such a  violation and to continue the process between the PLO and us,"  he said.    Under the PLO-Israeli Declaration of Principles signed in  Washington on September 13, 1993, the issue of the status of  Jerusalem will be resolved by political means and will be  discussed in 1996.    Meanwhile, the opposition Likud Chairman Binyamin Netanyahu  said Tuesday that Rabin's reaction to 'Arafat's call for jihad  was "totally unsatisfactory."    "'Arafat has revealed just how much it is Gaza and Jericho  first, with all of the other (occupied) territories and  Jerusalem slated to follow," he said.    A peace deal has just been signed, and now 'Arafat is  declaring a holy war to liberate Jerusalem, he said.    Netanyahu urged Rabin to "do more than just pay weak lip  service," adding that "he must shut down the PLO offices in East  Jerusalem and prevent Faysal al-Husayni and Sari Nusaybah from  serving on PLO negotiating teams and in the autonomy  institutions."    The National Religious Party, which also opposes the peace  process, said that "by giving up Jericho, the government has  made Jerusalem and its vicinity all the more vulnerable to  'Arafat and his bands of terrorists, no matter what cover name  they use."    It is reported that the Knesset, the Israeli parliament,  will  hold a number of debates in the next few days on 'Arafat's call  for jihad.    Israel occupied East Jerusalem in 1967 and has declared a  united Jerusalem as its eternal and undivided capital.    But the Palestinians have been claiming that East Jerusalem  is part of the occupied territories and should be returned to  the Palestinians in accordance with UN resolutions which call on  Israel to return all the occupied territories to Arabs.    So far, Israel has completed its army withdrawal from  Jericho  and the Gaza Strip. Meanwhile, Peres and 'Arafat had agreed in  Oslo on the principles on widening authority of autonomy to the  other parts of the West Bank.</p>

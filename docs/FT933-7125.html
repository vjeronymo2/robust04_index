			<p>930824 FT  24 AUG 93 / Mine safety plans face court test NACODS, the pit deputies' union, is threatening a legal challenge to government plans for changes in coal industry safety regulations. Mr Peter McNestry, Nacods general secretary, said yesterday that he would seek a judicial review of the proposed changes, which he claimed would severely weaken safety standards in the pits in preparation for their privatisation next year. The union's move comes as Mr Brian Langdon, deputy chief inspector of mines, cast doubt over the view that alleged defects in roofbolting contributed to last week's roof fall at Bilsthorpe colliery in Nottinghamshire in which three men died. He said he believed that the existence of old coal face workings alongside the development was a big factor in the disaster. Mr Martin O'Neill, Labour's energy spokesman, yesterday condemned the government's safety reforms and said: 'The government should now abandon its plans before more miners are killed. At the very least, it should wait until parliament has had a chance to consider them.' Mr O'Neill also called for a halt to the use of roofbolts pending the outcome of the Bilsthorpe inquiry, saying that in 1990 the Commons energy committee 'could not endorse the use of roofbolts'. He added: 'Yet the government's advisers have consistently encouraged the wider use of such American mining methods in order to increase productivity.' The new regulations were laid before parliament on August 6 and are due to come into force on October 1. The government said yesterday that it was open to any MP to question the guidelines for up to 40 days after their introduction. The Health and Safety commission drew up the regulations after discussions over the past six years. Both Nacods and the National Union of Mineworkers have opposed the regulations, arguing they will compromise safety - a charge denied by the government, the commission and the British Association of Colliery Management. Mr Kevan Hunt, British Coal employee relations director, said the new regulations - designed to replace detailed prescriptive statutes with more flexible codes of practice - would make the mines safer as well as more efficient. They lay down training requirements, specific duties for employees, and the preparation and duties of surveyors. Nacods' main objection is to the proposed division in the role of pit deputies. Under the new regulations it will be legally possible - but not mandatory - to have different people responsible for pit inspection and supervision.</p>

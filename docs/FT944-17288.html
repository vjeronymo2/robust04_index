			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / Books: Leviathan of the 17th century - AC Grayling hails the writings of Hobbes; philosopher, scientist - and chrysanthemum THE CORRESPONDENCE OF THOMAS HOBBES: VOLUMES I AND II edited by Noel Malcolm Oxford University Press Pounds 120, 1008 pages A Chinese saying tells us that 'orchids fear the Taylor-bird's song, but chrysanthemums survive autumn's frosts'; which means that early developers fade early whereas late developers go from strength to strength. This is an optimistic saying; there is hope for us all yet. Hobbes was a chrysanthemum. At the age of 46 he fell in love with geometry, and suddenly blossomed into an intellectual giant; despite Parkinson's disease later, and perhaps because he sang to himself every night as a way of keeping fit (he said it cleared his lungs), he lived to the grand age of 92, producing scientific, mathematical and philosophical works which had a profound influence upon the birth of modern times. These two volumes constitute the first collection of Hobbes's known correspondence, and their publication is therefore an important literary and philosophical event. There are letters here between Hobbes and - among many others - Pierre Gassendi, John Aubrey, Marin Mersenne, Gottfried Leibniz, Cosimo de Medici, and King Charles II, whose mathematics tutor Hobbes had been. Almost half have not previously been published. They open a window onto many aspects of the 17th-century world; anyone interested in history, literature, politics, philosophy and the history of science will find them utterly absorbing. The editor of these handsome volumes is a man whom Hobbes and his correspondents would have recognised as someone of their own stamp: a fine scholar who nevertheless engages with the world outside the academy. Noel Malcolm, political correspondent on the Daily Telegraph and sometime Fellow of Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, has done an outstanding job of translating all the Latin, Greek, French and Italian in the correspondence, providing excellent introductory material and biographical notices of Hobbes's correspondents. A reading of the letters and this elegantly written apparatus amounts to an education in the history of 17th century thought. Hobbes's most famous work is unquestionably the Leviathan, his great treatise of political philosophy. This work, together with the scientific and psychological theories he developed in connection with it, made him celebrated throughout continental Europe, but a figure of obloquy in his own country - partly because of the virulent anti-clericalism of his ideas, which made him seem an atheist, but also because the conclusion of his political theory is an uncomfortable one; namely, that the best form of government is absolute rule by a single sovereign power. Hobbes based this theory on his view of human nature, of which he took a deeply pessimistic view. Humans, he said, are greedy, selfish and distrustful, and will prey upon one another unless they are restrained by fear of a coercive power. Civil society comes into existence to give people protection against each other; each individual yields up, by consent, some of his liberty in return for security. But the logical terminus of this, Hobbes argued, is that full security is best achieved if there is a single absolute sovereign exercising power over all. The sovereign power might be a collective body, like parliament, or a monarch. Hobbes preferred the latter, on the grounds that a monarch will not be weakened by internal divisions, as might happen in a collective body. By postulating human nature rather than religion or tradition as the ground of civil society, Hobbes thought he had moved political theory into the realms of science. His ideas provoked strong resistance in many quarters, but his methods proved influential; his reliance on reason and experience helped to free subsequent philosophy from its thraldom to scholasticism and theology. It is one of the oddities of national temperament that whereas Hobbes's continental friends - many of whom, like Gassendi, were priests - were tolerant towards his attacks on religion, in England his views were regarded with horror. In 1666, after the plague and Fire of London, people began looking for reasons why God was punishing England, and a flurry of heretic-hunting began. A parliamentary committee considered a bill 'against Atheisme Blasphemy or Prophaneness . . . And in perticular . . . the booke of Mr Hobbes called the Leviathan'. Hobbes was saved from this threat, probably by Charles II, who was fond of him; but his reputation as a maverick remained. Interest in Hobbes has been steadily reviving in recent years, and Malcolm's magnificent edition of his correspondence will help to spur that process. No one has to agree with Hobbes to appreciate his achievement; failure to understand this fact is one of the reasons why England is often so slow to applaud its own.</p>

			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / International Company News: Court rules in favour of AT&amp;T AT&amp;T, the largest US long-distance telephone company, has won a Supreme Court ruling which will force smaller rivals to continue to publish commercially sensitive information. The Federal Communications Commission, the industry's regulator, had earlier ruled that MCI, the second largest carrier, need not publish details of agreements which did not match the company's published tariffs. The ruling, though, was overturned in a federal appeals court, a decision that has been confirmed in the Supreme Court. The courts ruled the FCC had exceeded the discretion it has under statute to alter the filing requirements.</p>

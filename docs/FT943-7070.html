			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: UK electricity Seeboard's purchase of 2m of its own shares should herald the beginning of a wholesale capital reconstruction of the electricity sector. But shareholders will only derive the full benefits if regional electricity companies reshape their balance sheets with vigour. Seeboard's buy-back corresponds to less than 1 per cent of its equity. Even buy-backs of 10 per cent - the maximum most companies have the authority for - would still leave the industry with gearing of about 10 per cent. Companies should be thinking of cutting their equity by at least twice that amount. The immediate advantage of a buy-back is to boost earnings per share. The consequent loss of interest income is more than compensated for by the cancellation of shares. Analysts estimate that, for a typical rec, buying back 10 per cent of its equity would enhance eanings per share by roughly 5 per cent. Another advantage for shareholders is that a buy-back reduces the risk that cash could end up in somebody else's pocket. It is not merely that managements might embark on unwise acquisitions. Cash piles could also prove an easy source of taxation for an incoming Labour government. Whether Seeboard has chosen the best way of handing cash back to its shareholders is more questionable. Recs will have to pay advance corporation tax on share purchases through the market. For tax-exempt investors, a share tender or some other mechanism that allowed them to reclaim tax would be preferable.</p>

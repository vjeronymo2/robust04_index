			<p>921005 FT  05 OCT 92 / Moscow warns Georgia over arms: 'Armed clash' if weapons seized from Russia THE RUSSIAN defence minister, General Pavel Grachev, has warned the government of Georgia not to fulfil its stated intention to take over all weapons and military equipment of the Russian (formerly Soviet) forces on its territory, or risk 'an armed clash with Russian forces'. This follows a warning on Saturday from Russian President Boris Yeltsin to 'take corresponding measures to protect the interests of Russian citizens' caught up in the growing conflict in Georgia. Mr Eduard Shevardnadze, the Georgian leader, had ordered the seizure of Russian arms at the weekend after touring the area of fighting in the northern Georgian autonomous republic of Abkhazia, where local forces took the town of Gagra after heavy fighting last week. Mr Shevardnadze said he would raise an army of 40,000 reservists against the Abkhazian rebels, who engaged the Georgian forces sent to the republic after it declared independence in August. The conflict is spreading throughout the Caucasus, as the Confederation of Mountain Peoples also vowed to raise a 40,000-strong force to assist Abkhazia in its struggle. The confederation draws its support from the largely Moslem Caucasian autonomous republics on Russia' s southern border with Georgia. Russian troops are also being drawn into the ever-fiercer civil war in the Central Asian state of Tajikistan, where supporters of ousted President Rakhmon Nabiyev have concentrated in the south of the republic and are battling with supporters of the new, pro-Islamic government of the republic in the regional capital of Kurgan-Tyube. Reports from the area yesterday pointed to continuing fierce fighting, with refugees streaming out of Kurgan-Tyube towards the Tajik capital of Dushanbe. The Russian detachments in the republic were strengthened last week, and are accused by the anti-Nabiyev forces of supporting the former Communist leader. Appeals for ceasefires in the regions and for the deployment of peace-keeping forces drawn from the members of the Commonwealth of Independent States (of which Russia and Tajikistan are members, but Georgia is not) have had no effect. A meeting of CIS foreign ministers is scheduled in Moscow today to prepare for the Friday meeting of CIS heads of state, postponed from September 25. Pakistan warned its nationals against travelling in Tajikistan, following the killing of a Pakistani businessman and threats against others in Dushanbe this month. Pakistanis have been active in trade in the republic over the past year. The Abkhazian defence headquarters has guaranteed safe conduct out of the republic for those Georgian troops fighting within it, according to the Interfax news agency last night. The agency said, however, that Georgian forces were continuing to reinforce positions in the north of the area.</p>

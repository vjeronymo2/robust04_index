			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On June 30, 1993, the Indiana legislature adjourned without taking the necessary action to enable Indiana to adopt and implement the I/M provisions mandated by the amended Act and the final I/M rule in Lake and Porter Counties. Failure to provide such authority prevented the State from submitting a complete SIP revision containing all the required elements of the program by November 15, 1993. On August 17, 1993, USEPA sent a letter to Governor Bayh of Indiana and to the Regional Administrator of the Federal Highway Administration advising them that USEPA had decided to exercise its discretionary authority under section 110(m) of the Act to impose sanctions at any time once a finding of SIP deficiency is made. After review of the committal SIP, USEPA proposed to disapprove the commitment on September 9, 1993 (58 FR 47415), and on November 29, 1993 USEPA disapproved this SIP revision based on the failure by the State to meet interim and final milestones in the schedule contained in the SIP submittal pertaining to the enactment of necessary authority to implement I/M requirements during the 1993 Indiana General Legislative session. On November 15, 1993, the State of Indiana failed to meet its commitment to USEPA by failing to submit a full SIP revision for I/M program implementation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Beyond being a specific mandate of the Act, enhanced I/M programs play an important role in the ability of Lake and Porter Counties to comply with the CAA requirements for achieving the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for ozone, as well as the Act's requirements for reasonable further progress (RFP) reductions for ozone. The Act provides that each state in which all or part of certain classifications for ozone and/or CO nonattainment areas are located is required to provide an attainment demonstration showing that its SIP, as revised, will provide for attainment of the NAAQS by the applicable attainment date(s). The Act further requires that each state in which all or part of a serious, severe, or extreme ozone nonattainment area is located shall submit SIP revisions that will reduce VOC emissions by November 15, 1996 by at least 15% of 1990 baseline emissions. If the reductions identified in the SIP revisions are less than 15% of baseline emissions, the state may obtain a waiver under section 182(b)(1)(A)(ii); this requires the State to make several demonstrations, including one that the plan reflecting the lesser amount includes all measures that can feasibly be implemented in the area in light of technological achievability. The Lake and Porter areas in Indiana will have difficulty meeting the RFP requirements because credit for certain pre-1990 CAA programs, such as the federal motor vehicle control program and basic I/M is not allowed. The additional benefits of enhanced I/M, however, are fully creditable towards meeting the RFP requirement. Enhanced I/M is one of the most powerful tools available to areas in terms of providing expeditious reductions in both VOC and NOx, both of which are precursors of ozone.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, a federally approvable enhanced I/M program represents one of the most cost-effective air quality control strategies available. Without an effective I/M program, attainment of the ozone air quality standard is virtually impossible, and without appropriate enabling legislation, an enhanced I/M program cannot be implemented.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II.

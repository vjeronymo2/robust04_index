			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Price Waterhouse chief goes to Charterhouse Mr Howard Hyman, head of corporate finance at Price Waterhouse, the UK's fifth largest accountancy firm, is to become managing director of Charterhouse, the merchant bank. The move will come as a blow to Price Waterhouse, which was planning to announce Mr Hyman's appointment as world head of corporate finance later this month. Royal Bank of Scotland sold 90 per cent of its ownership of Charterhouse at a loss earlier this year, with the stakes going to Credit Commercial de France and Berliner Handels und Frankfurter Bank. Mr Hyman, who is 44, will also become deputy chairman of Charterhouse Bank, the company's banking subsid-iary. He will be responsible for marketing and business development strategy, and the development of its European corporate finance network. He has spent the last few years building up Price Waterhouse's pan-European corporate finance network. He said negotiations for the move had started relatively recently and that he had been offered 'a very attractive' remuneration package. 'My main aim is to build up the European side,' he said.</p>

			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / The Blue Arrow Trial: Auditor's view on stakes questioned he did not know of all the holdings in Blue Arrow taken by advisers to the September 1987 rights issue until mid November that year was 'very hard to believe', the Blue Arrow trial heard yesterday, John Mason writes. Mr James Riddell, the former County NatWest financial control director, was questioned over evidence given by Mr Paul McNamara, a partner with Ernst &amp; Young, who advised County on the accounting treatment of its Blue Arrow holdings. Mr McNamara said that the first time he knew there were three stakes, held by County NatWest, County NatWest Securities and Union Bank of Switzerland, was when Mr Riddell had told him on November 16, said Mr Anthony Hooper, QC for Mr David Reed, the former County Natwest director. Mr Riddell replied: 'I find that very hard to believe.' Had Mr McNamara not known, he would have been greatly taken aback when told. That was not his reaction, he said. County NatWest, NatWest Investment Bank, UBS Phillips &amp; Drew Securities and seven individuals deny conspiring to mislead the markets over the outcome of the Pounds 837m issue. The trial continues on Tuesday.</p>

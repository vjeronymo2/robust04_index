			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / Observer: Time out A small rebellion put Rio de Janeiro out of step for a time with the rest of Brazil. The fun-loving capital refused to turn its clocks back in line with the rest of the country. Rio's decision to stay on summertime caused chaos in the city yesterday, particularly as the digital clocks placed along the beach are owned by the central government and were showing the new time. Radio commentators did not know what time to give, resorting to 'it's 10 minutes past the hour'. Airlines flying in and out of Rio had no idea whether aircraft were running on Rio time or Brazil time. Paulino Cicero, Brazil's minister of mines and energy, called it an act of 'insurrection', and a bitter blow for a country which always prided itself on its unity. Cesar Maia, Rio's new mayor, said it was all part of his new campaign to give his sun-worshipping citizens more time on the beach before lights out. But after a meeting with President Itamar Franco he agreed reluctantly to set the city's clocks back one hour putting his own and the president's watches once more in perfect harmony.</p>

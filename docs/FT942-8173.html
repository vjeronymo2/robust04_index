			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / Markets: The hidden costs of high returns - Serious Money The idea that income and capital are separated by some kind of Berlin Wall is as outdated as the Cold War. But breaking down this traditional barrier has created dangers as well as opportunities. The acceptable face of financial glasnost is the concept of total return. Today's intelligent investor targets the return produced by income and capital growth combined: getting the best return may well mean investing in shares with a low yield but good growth prospects. The financial sophisticate then creams off some capital when he needs a bit of pocket money, but would never be so irresponsible as to endanger his long term wealth. The unacceptable face is the pathetic picture of retired people who do not realise that the income produced by some ultra high income products comes out of their own capital, and only wake up when they have eaten their own seedcorn. Investment Ombudsman, Richard Youard, whose job is to resolve complaints from people who feel badly treated by investment managers, this week expressed his concern about 'income from capital' products (See page V) 'It is clear from the cases we have seen that investors instinctively assume that if the money they receive is described as 'income', it is not coming from capital or, at the very least, will in no way give rise to a reduction in their original capital.' Youard is particularly critical of salesmen who fail to make clear any risk to capital at the initial client meeting. He also deplores advertising literature which 'requires a D. Phil and a month's work to figure out.' The contrast between the financial sophisticate and the impoverished pensioner is stark. But as always it is the middle area that is hardest to deal with. Investors' hunger for products offering a high immediate income has been answered by a flood of disparate products: annuity shares of split level investment trusts, which leave you with only a token capital repayment; distributor trusts, which allow you to choose your income with no promises about maintaining the capital; and very soon income unit trusts which boost their yield by knocking their expenses off capital rather than income. The Securities and Investments Board, which has overall charge of investor protection, told unit trust managers this week that they may now knock their annual management charges off investors' capital, rather than their income. What this will mean in practice is that an income fund with a yield of, say 3.5 per cent now, will be able to increase it overnight to, say, 4.5 per cent, without any change in its underlying investment strategy. It will simply elect to knock its management charge (say, 1 per cent) off capital and pass the whole of the income on the underlying fund on to the investor. Some income funds plan to seize this opportunity; others do not. Regulator Lautro is due to send fund managers guidance on the explanations capital-charging funds will need to put in their advertisements and promotional literature. They will, for example, need to point out that capital may be eroded or future growth constrained, and that the tax take could rise. But the industry has no plans to make the differing charging practices evident in newspaper listings. So anyone who starts looking for a high income investment by comparing the yields of income funds quoted in a newspaper such as the Financial Times, will come away with an imperfect understanding of what is available. Two identical funds with different distribution policies will appear very dissimilar, since the only statistic commonly quoted is the yield. No professional investor would find this satisfactory. Consider the way share prices are presented. They are bunched into sectors because one of the key tasks of investment analysis is to compare one company with others in the same business. When you look at the share price service in the Financial Times, the yield will tell you about the current dividend policies of two retailers, and their price earnings ratios will give a fair reflection of the underlying profitability of both. This makes it possible for stockpickers to learn something useful by comparing the two shares. Surely investors looking for income funds are entitled to similar help? In an ideal world, fund managers might be asked to provide additional information, such as total return figures. At worst, some method of flagging funds which take their charges out of capital seems simple but essential. What is the annual running cost of Britain's unit and investment trust industry? Some back of the envelope calculations came up with a figure of Pounds 1.65bn, of which Pounds 1.4bn related to the Pounds 95bn worth of unit trusts and Pounds 250m to the Pounds 40bn worth of investment trusts. And what do investors get for their money? On average most funds do worse than the market. Here's another anomaly: the charging structure proposed by the new Baronsmead investment trust. Most management fees are a set percentage rate of assets. With Baronsmead, the larger its assets grow, the higher its management percentage.</p>

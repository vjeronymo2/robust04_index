			<p><P> October 11, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LA HABRA;  </P> <P> CITY WILL SOON BE 370 ACRES BIGGER  </P> <P> The city will soon be 370 acres bigger with the annexation of a tract of land  to the south of the city.  </P> <P> The council voted this month to annex the property, which is owned by Chevron  USA. The Local Agency Formation Commission some time ago approved putting the  parcel within La Habra's "sphere of influence." The parcel's southern border is  the Fullerton city limits, and its northern border is Imperial Highway. It is  occupied by about two dozen oil wells.  </P> <P> Chevron offices and a research facility are situated to the west of the parcel  and within the La Habra city limits, said Roy N. Ramsland Jr., a city planner.  </P> <P> Most of the remaining unincorporated areas in La Habra's sphere of influence  are occupied by homes. The many pockets of unincorporated land in La Habra were  the result of choices made by landowners in 1925, when the election creating  the city was held.  </P></p>

			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / Fowler to quit as Group 4 director SIR Norman Fowler, chairman of the Conservative party, is to resign as a non-executive director of Group 4 Securitas, the international group of security businesses, from 1 October to spend more time with his party. Sir Norman, who left Mrs Thatcher's cabinet early in 1990 in order to spend more time with his family, said yesterday that since becoming party chairman after the election last year 'my time has become increasingly limited and therefore I have decided, with great regret, to stand down'. In the general election campaign Sir Norman acted as Mr John Major's 'minder', signalling a return to full-time active politics, and for more than a year he has combined the party chairmanship with five non-executive director-ships. Group 4 hit the headlines in April when, soon after it had begun work as the first private-sector company to run services escorting prisoners between prisons and courts, four men escaped or were wrongly released within as many days. Sir Norman's decision will raise speculation that he hopes for a return to office with a senior post in the cabinet. The announcement came as Labour attacked the practice of cabinet ministers leaving government and almost immediately acquiring well-paid jobs in the private sector. Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, yesterday said there should be a delay of at least two years before ministers can take up posts in private business. He was responding to the announcement the day before that Mr Norman Lamont, the former chancellor, had been appointed a non-executive director of the merchant bank NM Rothschild &amp; Sons, less than four months after his reluctant departure from government.</p>

			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / Observer: Economic goals Could Chelsea football club's surge up the premier league table be a welcome economic omen? It sounds implausible, but if an observation made by Prime Minister John Major in a recent book holds true, the Blues' revival may be just the tonic the economy needs. Writing in 'We'll Support You Evermore' - an anthology of paeans to various soccer clubs by celebrated fans - the prime minister recalls how in the mid-1970s 'Chelsea's problems seemed to mirror the country's'. 'As Britain turned to the International Monetary Fund to bail out our economy, so Chelsea had to go cap in hand to its bankers . . . The upturn in Chelsea's fortunes in the 1980s was, like Britain's recovery, long overdue and extremely welcome,' comments Chelsea's famous fan. Does the relationship still hold? Time will tell. But the cognoscenti will note that Chelsea's lowest ebb this season was reached when Paul Elliott, one of its star players, was seriously injured - just 10 days before Black Wednesday.</p>

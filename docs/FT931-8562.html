			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / International Company News: Peripherals help Canon improve CANON, the office equipment and camera manufacturer, last year suffered a small decline in sales but posted a marginal increase in profits due mainly to the strength of its computer peripherals business. Pre-tax profits moved up 1.3 per cent to Y77.13bn (Dollars 637m) as turnover dipped by 0.9 per cent to Y1,063bn. Canon expects a modest improvement in both sales and profits this year on the back of a second-half recovery. It forecasts anincrease in sales to Y1,100bn and a rise in pre-tax profits to Y77.5bn. The company, chaired by Mr Ryuzaburo Kaku, which is considering buying the computer hardware operations of Next Computer, the US company, saw sales in its computer peripherals business rise 25 per cent to Y405.45bn in 1992. In the computer peripherals division, the company's laser printers sold particularly well in the second half after it introduced a new model, while its bubble jet printers increased sales last year as awareness of their advantages spread. Copiers also performed well. Sales increased by 4 per cent to Y332.9bn, largely on the strength of colour copiers, application equipment such as feeders and chemicals such as toners. But cameras suffered a 24 per cent fall in sales to Y167.29bn, as the economic slump dampened consumer spending. Cameras, which were Canon's mainstay in its early years, accounted last year for only 16 per cent of sales, against 21 per cent in 1991. Sales of communication equipment also fell back 12 per cent, to Y114.42bn, but this was largely a result of a transfer of the company's personal communications equipment business to a new company it set up last year in Hong Kong.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Colombo, June 15 (AFP) -- Sri Lanka's Tamil Tiger  guerrillas have dropped their key demand for a ceasefire and  offered to resume talks aimed at ending the island's ethnic  bloodshed, a Tamil tiger spokeman said Wednesday.    The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) spokesman in the  northern Jaffna peninsula, said the group was willing to open  political dialogue with the President Dingiri Banda Wijetunga's  government without pre-conditions.    Quoted by a BBC correspondent who travelled to the isolated  area, LTTE idealogue Anton Balasingam said the group no longer  insisted on a ceasefire and the lifting of an economic embargo  on their Jaffna stronghold as a prerequisite to opening talks.    Balasingam called for a political initiative from the  Colombo  government, but at the same time accused it of preparing for war  in the north of the country, where the Tigers run a parallel  administration.    In February last year, the LTTE offered to compromise on its  main demand for a seperate state called Eelam, and said it was  willing to accept a federal constitution that would give  minority Tamils greater autonomy.    However, the government remained skeptical and described the  LTTE overtures as a ploy to head off a military onslaught  against the rebels who have waged a protracted guerrilla  campaign since 1972.    Government security forces in the LTTE-dominated north are  confined to a handful of heavily defended military camps while  the administration is carried out through civil servants of the  minority Tamil community.    Fourteen months of direct talks between the LTTE and Colombo  collapsed in June 1990, leading to a revenewed round of  bloodletting that continues to add to the daily death toll in  the island's northern and eastern regions.    The government for its part has insisted LTTE supremo  Velupillai Prabhakaran must be directly involved in any future  negotiations and that the Tigers must declare their "intent" to  lay down arms and recognise other Tamil groups.</p>

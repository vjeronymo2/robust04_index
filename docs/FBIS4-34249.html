			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Passages within italics in Creole] </F>   [Text] Deputy Antoine Joseph recommends intra-Haitian  negotiations to avoid a military intervention against Haiti. The  lawmaker believes the Chamber of Deputies could play an  important role in these negotiations. To the former president of  the Chamber of Deputies, it is necessary to preserve national  sovereignty in exploring dialogue.    [Begin Joseph recording] Any self-respecting Haitian must  say  no to intervention. I do not believe that preparing for  war is the solution. What matters now is how to avoid the  intervention with a minimum of breakdowns with regard to the  actors concerned in the crisis. I admit that the Security  Council resolution complicated the situation because it goes  beyond the Governors Island accord. The accord had asked for the  resignation of General Cedras, while the resolution asks for the  resignation of the police chief and the Army staff as well.    Therefore, I believe it is more than time to begin  intra-Haitian negotiations. If we consider all that is happening  right now -- with Jonassaint, a government that is not well  installed, no prime minister -- I believe the Chamber of  Deputies now constitutes a reserve or reference that can begin  intra-Haitian negotiations, negotiations with Gen. Cedras and  the Army members to see how we can study the Security Council  resolution and later extend those negotiations to the  international level in an effort to find a solution before 25  June.    I think it is possible. Personally, as a lawmaker and a  former president of the lower chamber, and having a certain  knowledge of the political matters of this country, I am ready  to participate in all negotiations aimed at avoiding an  intervention in the country, but mostly to put an end to this  everlasting crisis.

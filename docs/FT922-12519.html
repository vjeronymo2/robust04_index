			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / International Company News: Ford to take 50% of Mazda arm FORD MOTOR, the second-biggest US vehicle manufacturer, yesterday said it intended to take a 50 per cent stake in Mazda Motor's US manufacturing subsidiary, Mazda Motor Manufacturing Corporation (MMUC). Ford, which suffered a record Dollars 2.3bn loss last year, said that it would acquire its stake in MMUC through a stock purchase of newly issued shares. Ford has held a 25 per cent stake in the parent Mazda company for more than 12 years. The proposal had been submitted to the US Federal Trade Commission and Department of Justice for review. Mr Howard Poling, chairman and chief executive, said: 'Ford is already a very important customer and supplier for the Flat Rock plant, with such a substantial stake in MMUC's success, it is only logical that we consider an equity position that fits our role.' Mazda said it would benefit from Ford's financial management expertise, while Ford would have access to MMUC's high quality manufacturing system. The move follows Ford's recent decision to invest Dollars 3bn in North America over the next three years. The companies, which have not put a figure on the transaction, said they hoped to reach a final agreement by the end of June. MMUC's Flat Rock, Michigan plant produces the Mazda 626 and MX-6 models and the Ford Probe. Next year, the Probe will become the first American-built right-hand-drive Ford vehicle in recent history to be exported to Japan and the UK. Mazda initially invested Dollars 550m in the plant, which has been operating since September 1987. Since then, MMUC has produced more than 750,000 vehicles.</p>

			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / UK Company News: Immunology seeks US funds Immunology Limited of Cambridge is to be the first UK biotechnology company to make an initial public offering in the US, writes Clive Cookson. It hopes to raise at least Dollars 20m (Pounds 11.6m). It has filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission to offer 2m shares in American Depositary Shares, at between Dollars 10 and Dollars 12 each. The company is changing its name to Cantab Pharmaceuticals, to reflect its origins in biomedical research at Cambridge University and its current location in Cambridge Science Park. The old name was thought to be confusing because many companies and university departments use some form of the word 'immunology' in their titles. The offering represents a little less than 30 per cent of Cantab's share capital, valuing the company at about Dollars 70m. The shares should start trading on Nasdaq in May.</p>

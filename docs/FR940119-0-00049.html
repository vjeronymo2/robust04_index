			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In &sect;650.6, paragraph (g) was modified to add the phrase, ``or ownership changes,'' to clarify that the permit does not transfer with the change in ownership of the business.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In &sect;650.7, paragraph (a)(1) was modified to replace ``provide'' with ``mail'' to clarify the way in which the reports will be submitted. The paragraph was further modified to contain the phrase, ``name and permit number of the vessels from which fish are landed or received;'' and the sentence, ``If no fish is purchased during the week, a report so stating must be submitted.'', to clarify reporting requirements for dealers and to be consistent with the reporting requirements of other regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In &sect;650.7, paragraph (a)(2) was modified to read, ``Required data are the number of employees handling fishery products by month. Reports for a given calendar year shall be submitted to: NMFS Statistics, 166 Water Street, Woods Hole, MA 02543, and must be postmarked by February 10 of the following year.'' This change further details the requirements for this reporting requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In &sect;650.7, paragraph (a)(5) was modified to add the following sentence, ``If no product was purchased during a week, a report so stating must be submitted.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In &sect;650.9, paragraph (b)(1) was subdivided into paragraphs (i) and (ii). Paragraph (b)(1)(ii) was added in order to clarify paragraph (b)(1)(i) by prohibiting more than one trip per calendar day.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In &sect;650.9, paragraph (b)(11), (b)(12), (b)(13), (b)(17), and (c)(4), the phrase ``Possess on board or'' was added to clarify the prohibition. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In &sect;650.9, the following changes were made to clarify the prohibitions. Paragraph (c) was subdivided into paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(7). Paragraph (d)(4) was changed to paragraph (d)(4)(i), and a new paragraph, (d)(4)(ii), was added. Paragraphs (d)(10) through (d)(15) were redesignated as paragraphs (d)(11) through (d)(16), and a new paragraph (d)(10) was added.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In &sect;650.20, paragraph (a) was modified to add the phrase, ``that may be landed, or possessed at or after landing,'' in order to clarify that the minimum shell height size is not an at-sea measure. Parallel changes were made to sections 650.20(b) and 650.9(a)(1) to reflect this clarification.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In &sect;650.21, paragraph (a) was modified to add the phrase ``in possession of more than 40 pounds (18.14 kg) of shucked scallops or 5 U.S. bushels (176.2 l) of in-shell scallops, or fishing for scallops,'' to clarify that certain trawl gear restrictions are also possession restrictions applicable to any vessel possessing more than 40 pounds of shucked scallops or 5 bushels of in-shell scallops. Similar changes were made to &sect;650.21(a) (1)&hyph;(2) and &sect;650.9(b)(8).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In &sect;650.21, paragraph (b) was modified by deleting the phrase ``holding a Federal sea scallop permit under &sect;650.4 and'' and adding the phrases ``of more than 40 pounds (18.14 kg) of shucked scallops or 5 U.S. bushels (176.2 l) of in-shell scallops'' and all vessels issued limited access scallop permits and fishing under the DAS allocation program,'' to clarify that the dredge restrictions apply to all dredge vessels in possession of more than 40 pounds of shucked scallops or 5 bushels of in-shell scallops. In &sect;650.21, paragraphs (b) (1)&hyph;(3) were modified to add the phrase ``in use by or in possession of such vessels'' to clarify that the dredge restrictions are possession restrictions also. The corresponding prohibition sections to these restrictions, &sect;650.9, paragraphs (b) (11)&hyph;(15) and &sect;650.9, paragraphs (c) (2)&hyph;(6), were changed accordingly to reflect these clarifications.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In &sect;650.21, paragraph (b)(iii), the sentence, ``The ring size will be the average of the measurements of any series of 20 consecutive rings.'' was deleted. This provision had been added by NMFS with the intent of facilitating enforcement. However, upon further consideration, it was determined that allowing an average minimum ring size would necessitate difficult and problematic measuring requirements and possibly would not be consistent with the Council's intent that no rings should be less than 31/4 inches. NMFS is developing a standard measuring device and procedures to determine minimum ring sizes and will publish a description of such device and procedures in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In &sect;650.21, paragraph (e) was modified to add the phrase, ``in addition to or notwithstanding other restrictions in this Part'' to clarify that vessels operating under the small dredge program are still subject to other restrictions in &sect;650 unless modified by the special provisions of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In &sect;650.24, paragraph (c)(2)(ii) was expanded to clarify the process for counting days at sea under the call-in system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930322 FT  22 MAR 93 / Arts: Britten Festival begins and ends with innovation - London premieres of Saxton's Cello Concerto and Dillon's Introitus The London Symphony Orchestra's Britten Festival began four weeks ago with a new work commissioned from Colin Matthews; its final orchestral concert, conducted by Oliver Knussen at the Barbican on Thursday, included a second premiere, from Robert Saxton. Saxton's new Cello Concerto was written expressly for Mstislav Rostropovich, and its proportions are imposing; it plays continuously for more than 30 minutes and it sets the solo cello against an orchestra that includes triple brass and a hefty battery of percussion. The music moves out from a lengthy orchestral introduction, a 'structural upbeat' in Saxton's terms, through carefully delineated sections which include a reflective slow movement and a dance-like scherzo back to the quiet ruminations with which it opened. The progression from darkness to clarity and back again is typical of Saxton; he refers to the concerto as being 'programmatic' in an abstract way, and certainly the very ending has almost a theatrical tension, as the cello line is left hanging with only a bass pedal to support it. Otherwise, though, the concerto is dogged rather than dramatic and it is difficult not to feel that Saxton has missed a precious opportunity. There are few more committed musical advocates than Rostropovich, whatever the cause, yet Saxton set him a thankless task: too much of the concerto condemns the soloist to busy figuration, as the thematic material is put routinely through its paces. The ideas are never vivid enough, nor the interplay between the cello and the orchestra sufficiently striking; what could have a luminous, intense work, given the auspicious circumstances, turned out to be a grey, undistinguished one. James Dillon's Introitus, introduced to Britain at St Giles, Cripplegate on Friday by Music Projects/London under Richard Bernas, scarcely set the pulse racing any faster. It is the latest instalment of the Nine Rivers cycle which has preoccupied Dillon since 1982, and by a long way the most ambitious to date. Planned as the eighth segment in the finished sequence (with the third, fifth and ninth still to be completed), Introitus was first performed at IRCAM in Paris three years ago: an ensemble of 12 strings is embedded in a web of computer-generated taped sound and electronic transformations which envelops both listeners and performers, creating what Dillon hopes is 'a tidal delirium opened up by the employment of computer technology'. The programme note painstakingly details the sources of the tape (from the string instruments themselves to the sound of cicadas and the periodicity of pulsars) and the digital techniques that were applied to them. For the most part, however, the sound is homogenised into a continuum through which the instrumental sounds, live and treated, only emerge vaguely. The total effect is generally far too amorphous; the telling moments towards the end of the 30-minute piece, appearing almost anecdotal in this context, arrive too late to lift what comes across as a forbidding and unrewarding experience.</p>

			<p>920601 FT  01 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: Putting Emu to the test It looks as though Danish voters will vote for ratification of the Maastricht Treaty in tomorrow's referendum. Opinion polls, which had suggested a narrow rejection, last week swung in the other direction. On the assumption (rather dangerous since the UK election) that they are right, European bond and currency markets will heave a sigh of relief. The perceived wisdom is that rejection would have three main consequences for the markets. Worries that the entire treaty might have to be renegotiated would be a blow to the interest rate convergence theory. This would affect not only the Ecu bond market, but also other high interest markets in Europe, including probably those Nordic countries which have proved vulnerable to devaluation fears in the past. Second, there would be a flow of funds into the D-Mark which would strengthen in the ERM. Third, pressure on the already vulnerable lira could become so intense that a realignment would become inevitable. The impact would be all the greater as markets are discounting a 'yes' vote. If that is the result, reaction may be limited to a modest upward push to bond prices in some of the peripheral, high interest markets. Beyond that, however, it is worth questioning whether the referendum result actually makes much difference to the prospects of an ERM realignment. In spite of the pressures on European economies resulting from tight German money, the idea of a realignment is currently taboo. Indeed there is a certain machismo attached to holding the line. There is no reason why the Danish vote should change that. The number of those who believe in a last realignment before European monetary union is dwindling. If the likelihood is really that remote, however, the differentials between German interest rates and those elsewhere in Europe should be even narrower than they already are.</p>

			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / Observer: Desert storm Jean-Marie Descarpentries, one of the more colourful members of the French business elite, has made it back from his short absence in the corporate desert. But the title of European development adviser to Novalliance, a medium-sized French packaging-to-property industrial group with a FFr 10bn turnover, seems distinctly small fry for the likes of Descarpentries who, until last September, was in charge of CMB Packaging. The show-case merger between Carnaud and Metalbox Packaging, two pillars of the French and British establishment, was, however, dogged by serious friction between respective management styles. The ebullient Descarpentries - who made his initial mark by taking CMB executives on a get-acquainted session to the Jordanian desert - stood aside four months ago. Accused by some executives of trying to divide and rule, he had been better appreciated when engineering the recovery at loss-making Carnaud  - in the early 1980s a company sorely in need of the Descarpentries touch. Now Novalliance seems eager for an injection of the decentralist philosophy which is his trade-mark. It may have got more than it bargained for.</p>

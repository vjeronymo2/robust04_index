			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Crime clear-up rate declines THE NUMBER of crimes cleared up by the police fell last year for the first time in three years, according to Home Office figures yesterday. Six per cent fewer notifiable offences were cleared up than in 1991. The figures marred a slowdown in the growth of the total number of crimes reported. Mr Michael Jack, the junior Home Office minister, said that the 6 per cent rise in the number of crimes which were recorded last year was 'encouraging' compared with the 16 per cent increase in 1991. The biggest rises in crime last year were cases of robbery and burglary which rose by 17 per cent and 11 per cent respectively. The number of residential burglaries rose faster than non-residential burglaries. The smallest increase was in the number of reported sexual offences. There was a fall in fraud and forgery cases. Across regions, there were falls in the number of crimes reported in Northumbria and in the City of London. However, crime in Cheshire rose by almost 20 per cent. Violent crimes had much better clear up rates with 95 per cent of homicides cleared up last year. The clear up rate for burglaries was 20 per cent.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] One can count days until the termination of the  first stage of the presidential campaign -- the collection of  signatures in support of candidates for the office of the first  Belarusian president. As a BELINFORM reporter has learned, few  of the candidates for the state's top post will clear the hurdle  of amassing 100,000 signatures. For example, as of 11 May, the  signature hurdle was cleared only by enthusiasts supporting  Prime Minister Vyachaslaw Kebich and Communist Party Chairman  Vasyl Novikaw. More than 160,000 Belarusians signed the  petition in support of the first candidate, and 115,000 of the  second. According to the number of supporters, the initiative  group supporting Stanislaw Shushkevich ranks next in line. That  group has already collected 90,000 signatures. According to the  headquarters for support of [opposition leader] Zyanon Paznyak,  it is too early to release information on their campaign. The  other initiative groups simply do not cooperate with the Central  Election Committee for Presidential Elections.</p>

			<p><P> February 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> A 91-year-old woman wandered away from her San Francisco home and spent four  days on the streets without food or water before a state transportation worker  saw her walking under a freeway overpass and took her to a local police  station. Dirty, tired and dehydrated, Modesta Montez Curiel "drank about a  gallon of water just like that," Police Officer Alan Siegel said. Police said  the 100-pound woman had apparently slept in nooks below the overpass about a  mile from her daughter's home after becoming disoriented and lost.  </P></p>

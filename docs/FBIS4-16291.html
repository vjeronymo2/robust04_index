			<p>BFN     [Text] Riga, Apr 14, BNS -- Latvian Saeima [parliament]  delegation handed Latvian Foreign Minister Georgs Andrejevs's  letter to the European Council's Parliamentarian Assembly  Tuesday [12 April] in Strasbourg. The letter is addressed to the  Assembly's Secretary-General Catherine Lalumiere. The letter  tells about events in Latvia, connected with Russian President  Boris Yeltsin's April 5 order to set up military bases in CIS  states and Latvia. The letter says that Latvian people consider  the order to contradict the Latvian-Russian initialed agreements  on Russian army withdrawal and the Skrunda radar station's  status.    Latvian people think that Yeltsin's order jeopardizes  Latvia's independence, says the letter. Though Russian  Ambassador Aleksandr Rannikh apologized for the incident and  said that Latvia was mentioned in the list by mistake, Latvia  still expects Russia to make an official retraction of the order.    While Latvia has not received the official retraction of  Yeltsin's order, the planned April 20 talks between Latvian and  Russian presidents and the signing of the initialed agreements  are postponed.</p>

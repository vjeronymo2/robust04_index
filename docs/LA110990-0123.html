			<p><P> November 9, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Mizlou Seeks Investors: Mizlou Communications Inc., seeking to calm reports  that the company was in financial trouble, said it is negotiating with several  cable companies about investing in Sports News Network, its fledgling cable TV  channel. SNN was launched last February as an all-sports news channel but has  been plagued by cost overruns for 10 months. Mark Wenzel, chief financial  officer of Mizlou, said SNN is available in 8 million households and has  contracts for another 10 million with cable system operators. In an effort to  cut costs, SNN reduced its program staff to 150 from 180 and moved to new  facilities in Edison, N.J.  </P></p>

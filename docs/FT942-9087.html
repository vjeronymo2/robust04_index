			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / Third new French newspaper The beleaguered French press yesterday gained yet another new recruit when the first issue of Paris 24.00 landed on the capital's news-stands despite production problems that halved the size of its print-run. Paris 24.00 managed to produce only 50,000 of a planned 110,000 copies, but its first issue was virtually sold out by lunchtime. The new daily, which is aimed at the mass market with a mini-tabloid format and FFr3 cover price, is described by Philippe Lecardonnel, editor-in-chief, as a 'city paper' that could be 'read in 15 minutes on the metro without getting your fingers dirty or poking your neighbour in the eye'. Paris 24.00 is the third new daily launched in France this year. InfoMatin and Aujourd'hui, two tabloids which were introduced in January, have seen their daily sales settle at 95,100 and 74,000 respectively.</p>

			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / World Trade News: Turks look to future with Bosporus radar - The costs of progress have put transit charges for ships on the agenda TURKEY is considering breaking with a tradition of more than half a century. It plans to introduce charges for ships going through the Bosporus, in an effort to defray the costs of a proposed radar system. Such a move would represent the first change since the Montreux Convention of 1936 established the Bosporus as an international waterway, guaranteeing free transit between the Sea of Marmara and the Black Sea. In April, 10 companies, including Thompson CSF of France and the UK's GEC Marconi, submitted bids for a turnkey supply contract for a fully automatic, computer-supported radar system. The project is estimated to cost Dollars 20m (Pounds 10.4m). It comprises as many as 20 direction-finding radars, providing the Bosporus with the equivalent of an air traffic control system. The project has been postponed a number of times, but a contract is now expected to be awarded in the next two months. Turkey is bracing itself for increased traffic. For the new Black Sea countries and central Asian states, the Bosporus offers the most direct route to western markets. In addition, once the network of canals in central Europe links with the Danube over the next two years, demand to use the Bosporus is likely to increase. Dr Demir Sindel, professor of marine engineering at Istanbul University and an expert on the Bosporus, says: 'If we have a good radar system we can manage twice the volume of traffic. But we must earn money from this. At the moment we have expenses but no income.' The Bosporus is one of the busiest sea lanes in the world, with more than 40,000 ships in transit every year, from coasters to oil and LNG tankers. In addition, it is also one of the most difficult waterways to navigate with 12 major turns, and as little as 500 metres at the narrowest point. There are just three passive radar units for the entire 30km length of the Bosporus Passage. When supertankers attempt the journey, port authorities close the Bosporus to other traffic. Despite traffic lanes, officials calculate there are on average 10 collisions every year. No formal request to the other Montreux signatories has been made to introduce transit fees. The Turkish Foreign Ministry is said to favour completely renegotiating the treaty, given that one of the main signatories, the Soviet Union, no longer exists. Turkey currently charges a fee based on tonnage, if ships choose to take pilots to direct them through the straits which divide European Turkey from the Asian mainland, but under Montreux pilotage is not mandatory. Officials at the Turkish Maritime Organisation (TDI) in Istanbul estimate that more than 20,000 vessels go through every year without pilots. Only warships have to notify the Montreux signatory countries, a key provision for Nato members Turkey and the UK during the cold war, when the Bosporus was an outlet to the Mediterranean for the Soviet Fleet. Earlier this year, Turkish authorities seized the Cape Malleas, a Greek-Cypriot ship taking arms to Iran. The public prosecutor defended the action, arguing that Turkey was still at war with Cyprus and thus, under Montreux, was empowered to seize the shipment, a position not supported by an embarrassed Turkish Foreign Ministry in Ankara. In practice, Turkey enjoys few other controls on the traffic. The TDI currently uses its right to make health inspections under Montreux as a means of regulating the frequency of ships.</p>

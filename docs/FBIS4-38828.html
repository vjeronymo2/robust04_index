			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, June 1 (YONHAP) -- South Korean President  Kim Yong-sam said Wednesday that after the North Korean nuclear  dispute is settled, Seoul is willing to provide economic support  to Pyongyang.    Kim, currently visiting Russia, made the remark while  delivering an address to the Council of the Russian Federation.    "If and when the nuclear issue is settled, the Republic of  Korea is ready and willing to provide economic support to North  Korea to help it rebuild its shattered economy and carry out  reform," he said.    Kim arrived in Moscow on Wednesday and has held two summit  meetings with Russian President Boris Yeltsin.    "... It is imperative to resolve international suspicions  about North Korea's nuclear development program as quickly as  possible. Without a decisive solution to the nuclear issue, it  will be impossible to preserve peace not only on the Korean  peninsula but also in Asia as a whole."    He added, "I sincerely appeal to you, distinguished members  of the Federation Council, to actively cooperate in solving this  issue."    The president also emphasized that Russia and Korea will be  able to work together in ushering in the fledgling Asia-Pacific  era.    "It will be impossible to preserve peace in Northeast Asia  without Russian cooperation. This is the very basis for the  joint efforts of our two countries to advance shared prosperity."</p>

			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / International Company News: Mexico gives Televisa network concession Grupo Televisa, the Mexican media group, has been granted a concession to 62 television stations that will enable it to extend a television network across much of the country. Televisa serves 90 per cent of Mexico's television audience, and takes a similar proportion of advertising. The new network will give the company a total of 291 television stations, about 51 per cent of the total in the country. The concession has been a controversy since the beginning of the year. Rivals complained that while the government was selling off two state-owned television national networks in an open auction, Televisa was being given another national network without any competition. The concession was granted to Radiotelevisora de Mexico Norte, a subsidiary of Televisa, after it promised to pay the Mexican government Dollars 91m. The two state-owned television networks were sold for Dollars 646m last July, to an investor group headed by Ricardo Salinas of Grupo Elektra. Critics say Televisa is being rewarded for its close co-operation with Mexico's ruling party. Televisa was not available to comment. The company is planning a secondary stock offering of about Dollars 900m later this month, which will give it a full listing on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>

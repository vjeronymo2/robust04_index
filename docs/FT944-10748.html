			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Losses prompt cuts at Warburg SG Warburg, the UK-based investment bank, yesterday said it would review staff levels and delay planned investments as part of a drive to cut costs after losing money on trading in the six months to September 30. Warburg, which issued a profits warning last month, saw a slump in investment banking profits from Pounds 98.4m in the first half of last year to Pounds 5.5m. Asset management contributed the rest of the Pounds 62.5m pre-tax profit, down from Pounds 148.8m. Dealing income fell from Pounds 140.6m to Pounds 45.3m in volatile and illiquid markets. Lord Cairns, chief executive, said Warburg made profits on proprietary trading, but dealing for clients - the 'vast majority' of its trading - did not cover costs. Lord Cairns and Sir David Scholey, chairman, insisted that Warburg had to remain a trader and marketmaker in securities to support other activities. They said the company remained 'strongly committed' to becoming a leading international bank. Total costs rose 10 per cent from Pounds 343.3m to Pounds 378.8m despite staff costs falling from Pounds 214.1m to Pounds 202.3m. Other operating charges, including investment in sales and trading technology, rose to Pounds 157.1m from Pounds 111.5m. Lord Cairns said Warburg would delay some investment in trading systems, particularly those preparing for higher volumes. There would not be 'a massive redundancy programme', but staff requirements would be scrutinised carefully. He and Sir David said that although reduction of expenses could not replace revenue generation as the prime engine of profitability, 'a reduced and more flexible cost base will contribute considerably to improving performance'. Lord Cairns was satisfied with risk management systems for trading. Warburg had reduced open positions after the tightening of US monetary policy in February, but 'if you are a marketmaker, you have got to be there'. Annualised return on equity fell to 9.1 per cent from 29.5 per cent, with earnings per share falling to 14.4p from 41.8p. The bank declared an unchanged interim dividend of 13.1p, as predicted in the profit warning. Lex, Page 24</p>

			<p><P> August 2, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: RETAIL;  </P> <P> EAST COAST CHAIN GIVES O.C. FIRM A HEALTHY BOOST  </P> <P> In a big boost to a little south Orange County company, the nation's largest  drug store chain has decided to carry CigArrest stop-smoking products at its  2,400 stores.  </P> <P> Advantage Life Products Inc. of Laguna Hills said Wednesday that Rite-Aid Drug  Stores, an East Coast-based chain, has begun carrying its CigArrest gum and  other stop-smoking products at its stores.  </P> <P> Advantage Life markets CigArrest primarily as a chewing gum to help smokers  quit their habit.  </P> <P> Advantage Life President Charles Sleichter said that Rite-Aid plans to put one  of the company's displays in each of its stores. The company also sells its  products through some major department store chains and at airport gift  counters.  </P> <P> "The selection by Rite-Aid illustrates the continued emergence of the smoking  cessation products market and CigArrests' leadership position in that market,"  Sleichter said.  </P> <P> The deal is the latest indication that Advantage Life continues to cash in on  the anti-smoking wave.  </P></p>

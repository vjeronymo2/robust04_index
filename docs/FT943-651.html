			<p>940928 FT  28 SEP 94 / UK Company News: AromaScan shares fall sharply to 82p Shares in AromaScan yesterday fell 14p to 82p, leaving the shares 18 per cent below their August flotation price. The company, which has developed an 'electronic nose' to detect odours, said it was not aware of any reason for the fall. AromaScan is the second NM Rothschild-sponsored flotation to suffer a slide within the past week. Aerostructures Hamble fell 40 per cent last Wednesday, after the company issued a negative trading statement. AromaScan, however, claimed that business was on target and that it had suffered no operational difficulties. Brokers said there had been a steady stream of small sellers, plus rumours that a market maker had built up a large selling position. Turnover on the day was only 90,950 shares. The company is developing commercial uses for its odour detection technology. Investors were warned in the prospectus that 'an investment in the company involves a higher than normal degree of risk'.</p>

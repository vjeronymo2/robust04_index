			<p>930927 FT  27 SEP 93 / US Money and Credit: Fed switches back into neutral THE LATEST minutes from the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee have just been released and show a surprising, albeit subtle, shift in opinion among the members of the central bank's main policy-making body. The minutes for the August 17 meeting showed that the FOMC voted unanimously to keep policy unchanged, but also to remove its earlier bias toward tightening and switch toward a symmetrical directive. In English, this means that the Fed is no longer so concerned about inflation, and, therefore, is now less inclined to make the next move in interest rates an upward one. The explanation for the shift was given in the minutes, which said: 'Members (of the FOMC) observed that the more favourable performance of key measures of prices in recent months had tended to relieve earlier concerns about a possible worsening in inflation.' The FOMC, however, always on guard against sending the wrong message to the fixed-income markets, added a big 'but' to the above statement: 'However, because the recent price indexes probably overstated the improvement in the trend rate of inflation, it was too early to determine whether they pointed to renewed disinflation.' The shift to a symmetrical directive on August 17 is particularly interesting for two reasons. It is interesting because senior members of the Fed, and self-appointed members of the alternative Fed (the Shadow Open Market Committee of economists that seems to have taken upon itself to act as the Fed's monetarist conscience) have been warning in recent weeks that if interest rate policy remains too accommodating, a speculative 'bubble' in stock and bond prices could inflate, and then burst, with dramatic consequences for the financial markets and the economy. The shift in policy is also intriguing because the most recent inflation data, released just under two weeks ago, appears to justify the Fed's qualifying statement in the August FOMC minutes. The latest figures showed that consumer prices rose by 0.3 per cent in August, which was well above Wall Street's forecast of a 0.1 per cent increase. Those figures gave the bond market a big shock, and presaged the return of long yields to back above 6 per cent, where they have stayed stubbornly ever since. That sell-off, and subsequent declines that were halted only in the final days of last week, prompted some observers to declare the bond market rally over. That could be a bit premature, for longer-dated prices jumped in the final hours of trading last Friday when the news of the FOMC's new stance was released. Yet, if the market reacts so positively to the FOMC's policy shift of August 17, it is just as likely to react negatively when the minutes of the latest FOMC meeting, held just last week, are released. Given that the most recent inflation numbers alarmed investors with their robustness, those minutes could well show that the committee has voted to return to a non-symmetrical stance with a bias toward tightening. If there is anything to be learned from the market's reaction to the latest FOMC minutes it is that investors should be wary of the coming weeks with the market in such a fragile state. A raft of economic data is due and several broking houses believe the figures will show a resurgence in economic activity. If the data does come in stronger than expected, then bond prices could tumble. The market has not forgotten the worrying August consumer prices number, and is likely to speculate much about what the FOMC decided last week. Against this background, no one is confidently predicting the return of bond yields to below 6 per cent.</p>

These countries have resources which, if they  were pooled, would enable them to check the interference of the  great powers. For the moment, the Iranian proposal can be  considered merely a desire which is formally expressed on such  occasions, because Iran is well aware that the components of  such an alliance are antagonistic and hostile to each other.  China and India had a military confrontation during the 1960's,  and subsequently their relations remained strained for a long  time. It was rather like a cold war between them. Of course,  they now have concluded an agreement to promote friendship. The  problems that were once created by Tibet's Dalai Lama have also  subsided and the border dispute has been resolved to a certain  extent. As a result, India has decided to withdraw two  divisions of troops from along the frontiers with China and to  deploy them in Punjab and Kashmir. At the international level,  however, the two countries are still contending with each other  to establish regional influence and superiority. India, in  particular, is badly gripped by this fever.    Similarly, Pakistan and India have a long history of  disputes, spanning about 1,200 years. India has repeatedly  targeted Pakistan for its military aggression to avenge the  1,000-year Muslim rule over India. In 1971, the Indian military  intervention in East Pakistan resulted in Pakistan's  dismemberment. Now, the Indian troops are engaged in the  massacre of Muslims in occupied Kashmir. Moreover, India is also  threatening Pakistan with a limited war. For obvious reasons,  how can the two hostile countries join hands on some regional  interests? The Government of Iran is fully aware of these stark  realities, and that is why Iranian President Hashemi-Rafsanjani  has urged India to strive to resolve the Kashmir issue  peacefully. Iran is fully conversant with the gravity of the  Kashmir problem. It is said that Ayatollah Khomeyni, the  founder and leader of the modern Islamic revolution, was of  Kashmiri origin.    It has been Iran's official stand that extending support to  the independence struggle of subjugated nations is not an  abetment of terrorism; it is like extending a helping hand to  realize the right to self-determination. Iran has always  rejected the U.S. and Western objections in this regard, and  never accepted the U.S. and European interpretations of the  human rights. In the words of the TEHRAN TIMES editor, the  United States has used the human rights issue as a political  weapon against the entire world including China, Pakistan and  Iran.    In view of these facts, the Iranian proposal to form a  regional bloc cannot be termed concrete or serious, nor should  Pakistan be concerned about it. In fact, if there can be a new  alliance or bloc, then it should include Pakistan, Iran,  Afghanistan, the Islamic countries of Central Asia, and Turkey.  That will be a natural alliance. These countries not only have  the commonality of religion among them, they have ancient  historical and cultural ties as well. An alliance comprising  Iran, India and China would be lacking natural ingredients.  Rather, they lack anything in common. The Muslim countries,  having common religious, historical, cultural and economic  values and interests, should join in a single platform and form  a regional bloc. If China can be included in the present  (?alliance), then there is no reason why U.S. hegemony in the  world could not be resisted.    The history of cooperation and friendship between Pakistan  and China is enviable. The PRC has now offered to cooperate  liberally with Pakistan to meet its weaponry needs. Pakistani  tanks and missiles are also being manufactured in China. China  did not even care for the U.S. pressure in this regard. No one  will object to China's inclusion in the alliance of Muslim  countries as China has not been seen to carry out aggression  against any neighboring country, nor has it claimed the  territory of any of its neighbors. It is hoped that the Iranian  Government will adopt a realistic approach regarding the  formation of a regional bloc.</p>

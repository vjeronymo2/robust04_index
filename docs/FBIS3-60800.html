The police in Arhus have asked Interpol for help in  identifying three Egyptians that might be connected to terrorism.    The three Egyptians, two of whom have applied for asylum,  are  in custody in Arhus, charged with arson of a Jordanian's home in  Tranbjerg. However, during the investigation police found items  that connect them to terrorism, according to ARHUS STIFTSTIDENDE.    While searching the home of one of the suspects the police  found among other things, a "bomb cookbook" with recipes for  making explosives. Two of the prisoners have also tried to buy  chemicals for this purpose from a business in Arhus. They were  refused because a special permit is required to buy some of the  items.    The search also revealed a leaflet urging all Muslims to  kill  infidels, a register of names and addresses of foreigners living  in Denmark, and papers in Arabic urging anybody participating in  subversive work to use false names.    According to ARHUS STIFTSTIDENDE, the potential political  elements in the case caused an Arabic-speaking interpreter to  become so nervous that he immediately asked to be excused from  the job of interpreting.    One of the Egyptians has lived in Brabrand for many years.  The other two, after a stay at the Sandholm camp, have had as  their address the Red Cross's asylum center in Odder for the  last two to three months. However, they have been at the asylum  center, where no other Egyptians live, only a few times, and the  rest of the time they have been at Brabrand.    The three men, who are 28, 35, and 42 years old  respectively,  were arrested on 18 November and so far are only charged with  arson. But in court on Friday [3 December] the prosecutor  reserved the right to expand the charges.    According to ARHUS STIFTSTIDENDE, one of the suspects  informed them during a previous hearing that he is an Egyptian  colonel who fled to Denmark because of having participated in a  political attack earlier this year. He alleges that he has been  sentenced to death in absentia.</p>

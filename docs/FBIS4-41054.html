			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Oleg Kuzmin] </F>   [Text] Tehran, 21 Jun -- The participants in the second  round of Tajik talks, which began on Saturday [18 June],  completed their fourth day in the Iranian capital today. There  were two sessions -- one in the morning and one in the evening.  If the discussion on the draft agreement on a cease-fire for  the duration of the talks, as proposed by Romero Piriz Ballon,  the UN secretary general's special envoy, had yielded some  positive results, it was expected that a plenary meeting would  have ensued, with foreign observers taking part.    However, the ITAR-TASS correspondent has learned from Otahon  Latifi, the head of the Tajik opposition's delegation, that the  talks are proceeding with difficulty; the sides have been slow  in moving from one point to the next and have been groping for  points of contact. But that is no reason for pessimism, Latifi  said.    Labor Minister Shukurjon Zuhurov, leading the Tajik  Government delegation, confirmed that the sides have thus far  discussed only the "first paragraphs" of the UN draft. He said,  however, that the atmosphere at the talks gives reason to feel  some restrained optimism.    The talks between the Tajik delegations will continue  tomorrow. The UN envoys will take part in them.</p>

			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / Russian miners call off strike Leaders of the mineworkers in Russia's Arctic core region of Vorkuta last night called off a threatened strike after talks with the government yielded further concessions to demands for payment of unpaid wages, extra social benefits and assurances on the future of the coal industry. About 30,000 Vorkuta miners had walked out yesterday morning after talks had broken down. The strike had threatened to spread to pits in the Urals region and to the largest Russian coal basin, Kuzbass in Siberia. The strike, the first the miners had mounted since early 1991, when their support for Mr Boris Yeltsin had helped bring him to power as president of Russia, had threatened his administration, at a time when the election campaign for the parliament is nearing its climax and the president is trying to drum up support for a draft constitution. The miners had presented over 20 demands; one was that the government under Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, prime minister, be restructured. Vorkuta has been the centre of the strike movement - in part because its highly paid mineworkers have received no pay for three months, and in part because a government closure programme threatens a third of its high-cost pits. However, the movement threatened to spread because of claims by miners' leaders that government promises to improve conditions were unfulfilled and because greatly-raised rail tariffs for the carriage of coal had threatened many mines.</p>

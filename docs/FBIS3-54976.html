			<p>Language: <F P=105> Armenian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Deputy Economy Minister Armen Darbinyan has reported  plans for Economy Minister Armen Yegiazaryan and First Deputy  Foreign Minister Zhirair Liparityan to visit Washington. They  will visit the IMF to hold talks on economic cooperation and  will provide detailed information to the Fund's directors on the  latest political developments.    Armenia has long been conducting talks with the IMF but the  situation in the region means the IMF thinks it is inappropriate  to allocate money to Armenia and Azerbaijan out of the  stabilization fund for countries moving toward independence; the  argument is that the resources could be directly or indirectly  used for nonpeaceful purposes.    To dispel such an opinion, the Armenian president recently  wrote to IMF Managing Director Camdessus expressing the hope  that the IMF will soften its stance since Armenia is not a  warring side and the international community has not recognized  it as such.    Once in Washington, the Armenian delegation will reiterate  our country's position, that is, to help in every way to  establish peace in the region.</p>

			<p><P> April 18, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> UNIFORM EFFORT PROPELS SAUGUS TO 8-5 VICTORY  </P> <P> So what if Saugus High doesn't have Roger Salkeld anymore?  </P> <P> They have his uniform.  </P> <P> The Centurions donned new duds for Tuesday's Golden League game against  visiting Palmdale -- blue and gray uniforms similar to those of the Seattle  Mariners, who made Salkeld the nation's third pick in last June's amateur  draft.  </P> <P> Dressed for success Saugus, on the strength of a pair of two-run home runs by  catcher J. B. Johnson and satisfactory efforts from three inexperienced  pitchers, fashioned an 8-5 victory.  </P> <P> The win gives Saugus (11-5-1, 7-1 in league play) a two-game lead over  second-place Palmdale (9-4, 5-3).  </P> <P> Saugus Coach Doug Worley, a Seattle native and University of Washington  graduate, insisted that the new attire was not a tribute to Salkeld. Not  solely, anyway.  </P> <P> "I was a Mariner fan long before he came along," Worley said.  </P> <P> Still, the uniforms served to boost morale -- which some players needed.  </P> <P> Johnson, for example, who struck out swinging in the first inning, admittedly  still feels the sting of last June's 1-0 nine-inning loss to La Palma Kennedy  in the Southern Section 3-A Division championship game at Dodger Stadium. In  his last high school game, Salkeld threw a bases-loaded, game-ending wild pitch  that skidded to the right of Johnson.  </P> <P> "It goes through my mind every once in a while," Johnson said. "It took a while  to say, 'Hey, that's only one pitch, I gotta forget that.' But this builds my  confidence a lot."  </P> <P> Said Worley: "He's been putting too much pressure on himself. I think he had to  realize, 'Hey, I struck out, but I came back and hit two home runs, that's  good.' "  </P> <P> Saugus, powered by Jeff Albert's two-run home run, grabbed a 3-0 first-inning  lead. In the third, Johnson crushed his first home run as Saugus extended its  lead to 6-0.  </P> <P> Palmdale countered with two runs in the top of the fourth, but Johnson smashed  another two-run shot in the bottom of the inning to give Saugus an 8-2 lead.  </P> <P> Sophomore left-hander Chris Hernandez (3-2) scattered four hits and six walks  over five innings. From there, sophomore Jayme Riggio, who was tagged for two  runs in the sixth, and junior right-hander Doug Maggiora, who entered in the  sixth and recorded his second save, mopped up.  </P> <P> Palmdale right-hander Jim Carson (4-3), who allowed six runs in 2 2/3 innings,  took the loss.  </P></p>

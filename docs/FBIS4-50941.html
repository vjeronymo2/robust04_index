			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Li Wei (2621 0251) ] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 23 May (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--General  Zhang Zhen, vice chairman of the Central Military Commission  [CMC], met Konan Koffi, Cote d'Ivoire defense minister, this  afternoon. During the meeting, Zhang Zhen said: Taiwan has  always been a part of China, and we do not allow the pursuit of  "Taiwan independence" or the so-called "one China, one Taiwan."  Any attempt to achieve "Taiwan independence" or "one China, one  Taiwan" will fail.    During their cordial talks, General Zhang Zhen expressed his  appreciation of Cote d'Ivoire's one-China policy, namely that it  only recognizes the PRC Government as the sole legitimate  government representing China.    Zhang Zhen pointed out that all disputes should be resolved  through friendly negotiations.    Zhang Zhen stressed that the Chinese Army is the people's  army, which always serves the people's interests, and that  China's national defense policy is of a defensive nature and is  absolutely for self-defense. He added that the assertion of the  so-called "China threat" spread by some Western people is  groundless.    The general hoped for the continuous development of the  friendly relations between the two countries and the two  countries' armed forces.    Among those present at the meeting were General Chi Haotian,  state councilor and defense minister; and Lt. General Li Jing,  deputy chief of staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.</p>

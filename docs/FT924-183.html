			<p>921230 FT  30 DEC 92 / Contracting out may prove an expensive undertaking: The row over European rules for transferring staff BUSINESSES bidding for contracts to provide services in the public sector often rely on cutting wages and staff benefits to make a profit. But some of the attractions for companies in bidding for contracts are now in doubt. Recent rulings by the European Court of Justice have led unions and some legal experts to argue that successful bidders may be bound to honour the pay and benefits of employees they retain. If they are right the case for contracting out could be seriously undermined, as labour represents about 80 per cent of the cost of public services. Many of those who are preparing the current round of compulsory competitive tendering and market-testing in local and central government are deeply concerned. At the heart of the dispute are the UK's 1981 Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) regulations which were designed to implement the European Commission's 1977 Acquired Rights directive. Where there is a 'transfer' of an 'undertaking' the regulations oblige employers to observe the contractual rights and obligations - except pensions - of employees they retain. If these regulations do apply, then in theory workers continue with no break in their employment rights. The central question is whether the regulations normally apply to contracting out. The government says the regulations can apply in the public sector, but ministers have insisted they do not apply where local authorities contract out in-house services under tendering legislation or in the contracting out of Whitehall services. Mr Michael Forsyth, the employment minister, is sufficiently irritated by the confusion to seek a UK opt-out from the EC directive. He argues that it should be left to national governments. Mr John McMullen, head of the employment unit and a partner at solicitors Simpson Curtis, said: 'For each contract, companies and government officials need to ask themselves whether there is likely to be a 'relevant transfer' of an 'undertaking'. Only if both conditions are satisfied will the regulations apply.' All cases must be considered individually but there are some generally agreed tests. First, an 'undertaking' is usually defined as an economic entity with, for example, its own balance sheet. Then, the more similar the function of the entity after the transfer, the more likely it is the courts would rule its 'identity' was intact. Finally, the easier it is to point to physical evidence of a transfer, for example equipment and staff, the more likely it is the regulations apply. Legal opinion is still divided over when the regulations will apply. A recent ruling by the European Court of Justice appears to reinforce the arguments of those who claim the regulations will normally apply to contracting out. This month the court indicated that the transfer of a management contract could constitute a transfer under the regulations, and that the sole question for national courts was whether the undertaking had retained its identity after the transfer had taken place. Each case would have to be considered on its facts in national courts. Firm court rulings on contracting out in the UK should reduce the uncertainty and several cases are pending. Meanwhile the unions hope they have found fresh support from the EC in their efforts to curb the market-led policies of the UK government. Some companies say that, whatever the outcome of the cases, they will not be dissuaded from bidding for contracts. Some contractors for skilled services, such as information technology, even say they prefer to transfer staff under the regulations. They rely on retaining experienced staff who are often earning less than their counterparts in the private sector. Mr Lynton Barker, the partner at accountancy firm Coopers &amp; Lybrand responsible for advising companies preparing to bid for Whitehall services, said that in cost calculations for a five-year contract overheads and technology would be at least as important as labour. There remains one clear reason the regulations do matter. Failure to apply them could expose the government and contractors to claims for compensation. Already unions are preparing retrospective claims on behalf of members who, they say, suffered losses as a result of earlier rounds of contracting out.</p>

			<p><P> October 25, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> The University of Colorado has implemented a new voluntary drug-testing program  for athletes that replaces the one ruled unconstitutional in August by a  Boulder, Colo., district judge.  </P> <P> The voluntary program emphasizes drug education and "probable cause" for  testing, both sticking points in the previous decision by Judge Joseph  Bellipanni.  </P> <P> Athletic Director Bill Marolt said the university still plans to appeal  Bellipanni's ruling, which struck down a stricter drug policy that required  mandatory random testing.  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 13, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UNLEASHED DOGS AND POSTMEN  </P> <P> The postman has a right to protect himself. If he had killed the dog in any  other manner would it be an issue today? No!  </P> <P> As an ex-animal control officer with 10 years experience, I have witnessed and  investigated many dogs and their owners for violations of vicious dog attacks.  Most dog owners will not admit their dog is vicious or comply with any  provisions of the law that would protect the public.  </P> <P> No one has raised the question as to what the dog was doing out in front of the  property with no fence or proper restraint (leash). The dog owner was just as  much at fault for not complying with the provisions of the Municipal Code,  which protect the public as well as the animals from harm.  </P> <P> It's unfortunate that the young boy had to witness the act, but if he had  witnessed the dog get run over by a car he would have suffered the same trauma.  </P> <P> Finally, with all our public servants becoming easy prey for drug users to rob  and hurt and all the dog owners who allow their dogs to run the streets, you  cannot blame the postman or any other public servant for taking a precaution he  felt necessary for protecting life and limb.  </P> <P> ALBERT CARRILLO  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>930125 FT  25 JAN 93 / Growing clamour for a stronger voice: The balance of power in Japan is shifting towards those who want their country to play a bigger international role Japan's political leadership is considering taking its boldest step yet into the uncertain post-cold war world. It will soon decide whether to begin a review of Article Nine of the 1947 constitution, imposed by the US in its postwar occupation. Article Nine, known as the peace clause, renounces war and the use of force. It is at the heart of Japan's troubled postwar identity. The review, which senior figures in the ruling Liberal Democratic party are expected to propose today, would involve all the main political parties in potentially divisive debate about the merits of the constitution. Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, has signalled he is opposed to change, while Mr Michio Watanabe, the foreign minister, and several other powerful cabinet ministers argue that reform is essential if Japan is to play a wider role in the world. For traditionalists, including many in the Social Democratic party, the main opposition party, the clause enshrines Japan's exceptional character as a state that does not wish to translate its economic power into military might. To revisionists, it is an anachronism of the cold war era, which consigns Japan to an unhealthy dependence upon the US. Since the end of the cold war, Japan has taken several small steps towards becoming more active in world events, highlighted by the recent dispatch of troops abroad for the first time since the second world war to serve as United Nations peacekeepers in Cambodia. But as yet there seems to be no clear answer to the question: what kind of international power does Japan want to become? It is widely accepted that the Yoshida doctrine, which has guided Japan's foreign policy since the 1950s, is not tenable. The doctrine, named after Shigeru Yoshida who dominated Japanese politics after the war, has four components: Japan's main goal should be economic development to match the west; it should be lightly armed and avoid involvement in international conflicts; to achieve this it should accept the political leadership and military protection of the US; Japan's diplomacy should be 'value free' to allow it to trade with a wide range of states regardless of their political complexion. The doctrine has been one of the most durable successes of postwar foreign policy among the leading powers. While Japan has been politically withdrawn, it has forged ahead economically. But the doctrine is being overtaken by events. The bindings of its relationship with the US are loosening. The Russian military threat, which brought the US and Japan together, has receded. The US increasingly views Japan as its arch economic competitor. For Japan, economic power has brought the need to make choices. For three decades after the second world war, the aim was to catch up with the west. Now that it has caught up, it cannot remain a follower; it has to set its own course. Several camps are competing to provide Japan with a foreign policy lead: The traditionalists. The most prominent is Mr Miyazawa. This group has elevated the pragmatic Yoshida doctrine into a faith, based on the belief that Japan is a 'special state'. Its history of wartime aggression and, most importantly, nuclear bombing make it exceptional, the group argues. Japan should accept as a principle a modest international role under the US umbrella, say the traditionalists. Japan's sovereignty must always be compromised, they believe, because it can never become an international military force, even in the cause of peace. The traders. Mr Noahiro Amaya, former vice-minister at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, has been the most controversial proponent of Japan as a commercial democracy. Miti is still the bastion of this view. The traders believe Japan should model itself on the great trading powers of the 15th and 16th centuries, such as the Netherlands. According to this view, Japan is the world's merchant, the US is the world's samurai. Japan should assess diplomatic initiatives against their financial returns. The new realists. The most famous is former prime minister Mr Yasuhiro Nakasone. The most influential is Mr Ichiro Ozawa, a young LDP politician who is expected to become one of the most powerful figures in Japanese politics in the course of the decade. The new realists believe that adherence to Article Nine is isolationist pacificism. Japan's international partners will see it as a free rider, benefiting from the world's trading system but doing little to protect it. The realists believe the 1991 Gulf war showed that a cash-based approach to diplomacy does not work. After much debate, Japan contributed Dollars 13bn to a war effort that most Japanese did not support. Yet the nation feels it received only grudging thanks from its international partners, who accused it of dragging its feet. The realists argue that the link with the US should be strengthened: Japan should contribute more to international security through finance, personnel and technology. Japan's political institutions should be reformed to create a two-party political system, which would generate open debate on Japan's foreign policy priorities. Yet, they say, Japan should not simply follow the US. It should represent an Asian view of the world, especially on economic issues, where the US and Europe could learn from the Far East's dynamism. The nationalists. The end of the cold war has unleashed nationalism in much of Europe. Such a movement is politically muted in Japan, for fear of rekindling other countries' fears that it harbours imperial ambitions. Yet there is an increasingly powerful sense of national pride in Japan, stemming from the contrast between its economic achievements and social stability and America's economic and social malaise, symbolised by the spread of drugs, urban violence and divorce. The Yoshida doctrine was framed when Japan was vulnerable. Japan's future foreign policy will reflect its growing national confidence. The visionaries. Members of this group hold widely differing views, but they share a belief that Japan should stand for a new kind of world order. They comprise people like Mr Akio Morita of Sony, who has called for an international standardisation of employment and social provisions to ensure fair competition. Others argue that Japan should become the standard bearer of an international welfare state, focusing on solving transnational issues such as the environment, Aids and refugee relief. The balance of power is gradually shifting from the traditionalists and the traders, who take their lead from the foreign policy of the 1950s and 1960s, to the new realists, who will articulate Japan's self-confidence. This change in part reflects the rise of a younger generation of political leaders, with no memory of Japan's war-time devastation or its postwar dependence upon the US. The shift in Japan will pose troubling questions for the US and Europe. Japan has so far played a limited international role, partly because the west has been unsure what role it wants Japan to play. Japanese politicians frequently complain that the west wants Japan to be content as an international cash dispenser, providing finance for events such as the Gulf war or reform in Russia, without having an equal voice on policy. This is symbolised, for the Japanese, by their lack of a permanent seat on the UN security council. The accession of the new realists into positions of power in Japan will bring benefits and costs for the west. Japan will play a more active world role, but the west will also find it tougher to bargain with.</p>

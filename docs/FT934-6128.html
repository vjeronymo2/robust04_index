			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / Case against Polly directors dismissed A High Court judge has dismissed on lack of evidence attempts to bring disqualification proceedings against four directors of Polly Peck International, the collapsed conglomerate. In transcripts of a hearing earlier this month Mr Justice Lindsay calls the case made against the directors 'at best speculative and very weak'. His ruling covers Mr David Fawcus, Polly Peck's finance director; Mr Mark Ellis, joint managing director in 1983-87; and Mr Lawrence Tindale and Mr Ulf Siebel, two non-executive directors. The judgment will prove an embarrassment to the Department of Trade and Industry, which was last month criticised in a National Audit Office report on the whole process of directors' disqualifications, including their administration. It appears to focus responsibility for alleged misconduct among directors solely on fugitive businessman Mr Asil Nadir, the former chair-man of Polly Peck, who faces charges totalling Pounds 34m for theft and false accounting. The DTI was requesting more time to bring disqualification proceedings beyond the normal statutory limit of two years after the insolvency of the company. But the judge said there had been delays in preparing the case that were 'unreasonable', and there was 'no good reason' for the extensions. He added that further delays would prejudice the directors under scrutiny. The DTI's case was based on statutory reports submitted on each of the directors made by Mr Christopher Morris, a partner with accountants Touche Ross and one of the joint administrators of Polly Peck. Most of the reports are believed to have been in general terms without specific evidence to justify disqualification. One referring to Mr Nadir was highly critical. The transcript shows the case was based on four charges related to inadequate financial controls, and failure to monitor or question spending in Polly Peck's Near East subsidiaries. The DTI's case - based on the 'D forms' or statutory returns on all the directors from the administrators to Polly Peck - was based on four general grounds: Failure to institute adequate controls over the expenditure and transfer of monies from PPI. Failure to ensure that adequate financial controls and reporting procedures were implemented and adhered to in respect of the Near East subsidiaries. Failure to obtain appropriate responses to the question of the need of the Near East subsidiaries for such substantial funding from PPI. Failure to monitor, or to set up proper procedures for monitoring, the actual expenditure incurred by the Near East subsidiaries; the funds which had been provided to the Near East subsidiaries; and the ability of the Near East subsidiaries to repay their indebtedness to PPI as and when required or at all. The DTI argued that the directors failed to threaten to resign if omissions and lack of knowledge and control were not rectified. But Mr Justice Lindsay called the charges 'misconceived' and said the resignations of the directors might have done little to remedy the problems of the company. He was also critical of some unreasonable delays and the 'leisurely pace' between the commencement of the Polly Peck administration on October 25 1990 and the presentation by the DTI of its disqualification case to the courts in June last year. The DTI has only a few days left for an appeal. 'We are actively seeking legal advice on whether to appeal,' it said.</p>

			<p><P> December 11, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH;  </P> <P> BUILDING CORDONED AFTER BULGE DEVELOPS  </P> <P> A 68-year-old building at Pacific Coast Highway and Main Street in the downtown  area was cordoned off from pedestrian traffic Monday after one of its brick  walls started bulging outward.  </P> <P> City officials said no bricks actually fell from the building, which houses  Jack's Surfboards, and no one was hurt. But they said that because the  structure looked as if a partial collapse might be possible, the sidewalk was  sealed off by yellow tape. Two upstairs apartments in the two-story structure  also were evacuated.  </P> <P> "We don't know what caused it," said Deputy Fire Marshal Dennis Groat. "We've  closed the area off to protect people from possible injury."  </P> <P> The surfboard shop is somewhat of a downtown landmark, located across the  street from the municipal pier and visible to thousands of motorists who pass  by on Pacific Coast Highway each day. The old building is opposite the gleaming  new Pierside Pavilion, a complex of newly built shops, theaters and  restaurants. Pierside Pavilion opened this year as part of the city's downtown  renewal.  </P> <P> Jack's Surfboards also is scheduled for some type of renewal, city officials  said. They added that the bulging condition of the old brick building may now  hasten a decision on whether to tear it down or try to restore it. Groat noted  that the building, like most of the older structures in the downtown area, was  not built to earthquake-safety standards.  </P> <P> Mike Adams, city director of community development, was at the scene, surveying  the possible hazard at 3 p.m. Monday.  </P> <P> "It looks like face bricks are hanging out further than they should, so we're  going to double check and take all safety precautions," Adams said. "We're  going to put a scaffolding up there tonight. We're going to get engineers in  here the first thing on Tuesday morning and make sure the building is still  structurally safe. We've also told the occupants of the two apartments (that  were evacuated) not to stay there tonight."  </P> <P> Adams said there had long been a slight curve in the Jack's Surfboards wall  that faces Main Street. But he said the bow became a distinct bulge Monday  afternoon, generating fears about the building's safety. The bottom floor of  the building is used for the surfboard shop, and the apartments are on the  upper floor.  </P> <P> Adams said the downstairs surfboard business is being permitted to continue  operation, but access to the store is limited to doors not near the bulging  wall.  </P> <P> "This building has always been scheduled to be part of downtown redevelopment,"  Adams said. He said no decision had been made whether to renovate the building  to earthquake safety standards or to raze it and build a new structure.  </P> <P> The building's owner, Mike Abdelmuti, said the building was constructed in  1922, during the early heydays of the Huntington Beach oil boom.

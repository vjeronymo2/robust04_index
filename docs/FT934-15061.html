			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / FT Exporter (8): Checking out the buyers - Paul Melly examines the ways in which the creditworthiness of potential customers can be verified / Credit risk assessment WHEN a company's home market is in recession, attempts to increase business through exports can become an increasingly important part of sales strategy. But while winning foreign orders is one thing, getting paid is another. Exporters need a way of tackling commercial payment risks in markets such as Europe and the United States, where political risk is not an issue, especially today with these markets in recession. The problem is compounded by the increased tendency towards open account trading, particularly between European buyers and sellers - that is, trading without the payment security associated with letters of credit which involve various levels of bank protection. One solution is to seek the protection of a credit insurance policy. In the UK these are issued chiefly by London-based Trade Indemnity and Cardiff-based, but Dutch-owned NCM, formerly the short-term insurance division of the UK's Export Credits Guarantee Department. Protection can also be sought through such specialist activities as factoring, where a third party can take over the responsibility for collecting and, where required, guaranteeing a substantial portion of due payments. However, the issue of payments security can also be addressed by exporters themselves by more closely examining the risks associated with selling to a specific client, especially where new business is concerned. In addition to a dedicated in-house individual or team, such an approach requires accurate information about the buyers. Exporters need to decide at what point such an approach makes economic sense. It is not easy to obtain accurate information on the recent financial performance of buyers in many parts of the world, either because the data is not published or because no central collection point, such as Companies House in the UK, exists. This applies not only to developing countries, but also to many newly-industrialised markets, such as Hong Kong or Saudi Arabia, and to some of the most powerful industrial economies in the west. In Germany, medium-sized family firms - the Mittelstand - account for an important slice of the market yet most are privately owned and do not have to release the detailed financial results that publicly quoted firms in Britain disclose. Only 11,000 companies in Germany are legally obliged to file accounts, compared with 900,000 in the UK, and a fine of just Dollars 30 puts little pressure on them to do so. In France, company accounts are lodged at local chambers of commerce, rather than a national centre. Finding out which chamber holds a buyer's accounts can be time-consuming and, in any case, annual accounts give only a limited picture of a buyer's creditworthiness and reliability. Such problems can, however, be largely overcome by using the services of credit reporting agencies. These systematically collect published financial information and catalogue it on computerised databases. The published accounts are supplemented with a mountain of detailed practical information on trading and payment performance from a wide range of sources. Agencies such as Graydon (owned by leading credit insurance groups NCM, Hermes and Coface), CCN, Infocheck and Dun &amp; Bradstreet charge between Pounds 20 and Pounds 100 for a detailed report on a company in Europe or North America, depending on the amount of detail required and the country concerned. At a time of economic uncertainty, exporters often need to monitor their main customers continuously to avoid the risk of not being paid for goods supplied or of receiving the money late. Another danger is a slump in orders as financial problems force a buyer to cut back on new purchases. Big credit reporting agencies, for a fee of only a few pounds, will monitor the status of a foreign buyer and warn the exporter of any financial problems. Europe's leading credit insurers are developing a rival Europe-wide service, Eurogate, which aims to provide reports on buyers in all 12 EC countries in a standardised format. In their original form, company accounts are hard to compare, as accounting requirements vary from country to country. But the Eurogate service aims to ensure that all buyers are assessed using the same criteria. The drive behind the creation of Eurogate late last year, came from NCM, Hermes and Coface, three of the biggest credit insurers. They wanted to ensure universally high standards of data collection because they draw on credit reports for their own assessment of buyers. Founder reporting agencies in Eurogate included reporting agency Graydon (in Britain, the Netherlands and Belgium), France's SCRL, and Burgel Wirtschaft Information in Germany. But the network is being extended to include members in Austria, Italy, Portugal, Spain and Switzerland. However, Eurogate members will have a tough fight matching the competitive strength of Dun &amp; Bradstreet, which has data on 10.5m European companies on file. It already has a system for presenting reports in a standard format, with standard principles for assessing creditworthiness. Dun &amp; Bradstreet provides detailed analysis of payment delays and defaults. Reports can be translated into half a dozen languages. Customers can pick out the various bits of information that they need, rather than taking the whole report. Leading agencies such as Dun &amp; Bradstreet are able to offer an on-line service providing exporters with data through a direct electronic link to their offices. Graydon, through Eurogate, is now developing this service: information from the Netherlands, Belgium and France is already on line; Spain and Portugal will follow at the end of October, and Italy and Switzerland at the end of November. But agency information, however detailed, is no guarantee of future payment. Even if a report is favourable, an exporter may still decide to take out credit insurance cover, or insist on secure trade financing terms - such as a confirmed irrevocable letter of credit.  --------------------------------------------------------           EXPORT CREDIT AND COLLECTION SURVEY  -------------------------------------------------------- Country        Exchange         Collection     Most                 delays            skills      liberal                (months)                      suggested                                               terms  -------------------------------------------------------- Australia         2             Good-Fair        OA Brazil            4                  Fair       ULC Canada            2             Good-Fair        OA Chile             2             Good-Fair     30/SD Egypt             2             Fair-Good       ULC Ghana             3                  Fair       ULC Hong Kong         2             Good-Fair        SD India             2             Fair-Good        SD Indonesia         3             Fair-Good        SD Israel            3                  Fair       CAD Jamaica           4                  Fair       CAD Japan             1                  Good     90/SD Kenya             4             Fair-Poor       ULC Koreas S          3             Fair-Good        SD Kuwait            3                  Fair       ULC Malaysia          2             Good-Fair        SD Mexico            2             Fair-Good     30/SD New Zealand       2             Good-Fair     30/SD Nigeria           3             Fair-Good       ULC Oman              3             Good-Fair        SD Pakistan          3             Fair-Good       ULC Philippines       3             Poor-Fair       ULC Saudi Arabia      3             Fair-Good        SD Singapore         2             Good-Fair     30/SD South Africa      3             Good-Fair        SD Thailand          3             Good-Fair        SD Trin &amp; Tobago     2                  Fair       CAD Turkey            3             Fair-Good        SD UAE               3             Fair-Good        SD US                2             Good-Fair     60/SD Venezuela         3                  Fair       ULC Vietnam           5             Fair-Poor       CLC  -------------------------------------------------------- Notes: 1.

			<p>920817 FT  17 AUG 92 / Letter: Poor argument for employers to scrap disabled quota scheme Sir, The Confederation of British Industry's statement (Letters, August 10) that more employers must be made aware of what disabled people can offer in the labour market is to be welcomed. However, we strongly disagree with the view that because employers cannot make the quota scheme work it should be scrapped. Quota schemes do work elsewhere in Europe - most notably in Germany, which has implemented a very effective quota scheme of 6 per cent. However, such schemes need the full support of government and in the UK the government does little to enforce it: three-quarters of employers fail to meet the UK's more limited 3 per cent target, yet there have only been some 10 prosecutions since the quota was implemented in 1944. Mr Gilbert of the CBI argues that one problem with the scheme is that disabled people themselves object to being categorised by the registration process. The Spastics Society's own research shows that, in fact, the reason disabled people do not register for the quota scheme is that they have little faith in its effort on behalf of government and employers to make the most of the untapped pool of talent represented by unemployed disabled people.

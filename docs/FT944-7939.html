			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / International Company News: Friendly Amgen approach wins Synergen's support Mr Gordon Binder, chairman of Amgen, is clear about why the biggest US biotechnology company is not about to succumb to an unwanted takeover. 'There's never been an unfriendly takeover in the biotech industry. It's never been attempted, let alone succeeded,' he said in an interview earlier this year. Friendly takeovers, though, are very much in fashion - and last week Mr Binder himself conjured up one of the biggest yet. On Friday, Amgen said it had reached agreement to pay Dollars 240m in cash for Synergen, a Colorado-based company. The lack of hostile takeovers, according to Mr Binder, is due to the fact that the success of biotech companies is built on a relatively small number of people: a hostile bid could alienate these people, destroying the value of the company being acquired. It is not difficult to see why Amgen's approach to buy Synergen won the support of the company. At Dollars 9 1/4 a share, its offer was about 70 per cent higher than the stock market's valuation of the company. Yet even that is only about one-eighth of the peak hit by Synergen's share price in 1992. It fell from grace in early 1993, though, on the failure of its most promising drug, Antril, a treatment for sepsis. The acquisition will boost Amgen's pipeline of new products under development with Synergen's own range of cancer, inflammation and neurobiology drugs under development. The deal should help to counter doubts expressed by some analysts about the scarcity of new products due from Amgen in the near term. In spite of Mr Binder's protestations, these doubts have helped to turn Amgen itself into a potential takeover target, in part explaining a rise in the company's share price from a low in April of less than Dollars 40 to its close yesterday at Dollars 56 3/4 , close to a 12-month high. Amgen has this year maintained a high rate of revenue growth. Third-quarter revenues reached Dollars 426m, while full-year sales are expected to rise some 20 per cent to Dollars 1.6bn.</p>

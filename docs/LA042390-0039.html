			<p><P> April 23, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POPE PLANS LONG-AWAITED VISIT TO CUBA  </P> <P> Pope John Paul II will make a long-awaited pastoral visit to Cuba later this  year, the Vatican announced Sunday.  </P> <P> The announcement triggered speculation in the papal party, not confirmed by the  Vatican, that Cuba became an added starter to the Pope's crowded 1990 travel  schedule to take advantage of international momentum for democratic change  begun with the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe.  </P> <P> The pontiff, who repeatedly applauded what he called East Europe's return to  "freedom's road" on his two-day Czechoslovak visit, had not been expected to  travel to Cuba until some time in 1991.  </P> <P> Meeting with reporters while the Pope celebrated Mass here, his spokesman,  Joaquin Navarro, said that the visit will come before Christmas and probably  will last five or six days. Navarro said that John Paul was formally invited to  make the visit by Cuba's Roman Catholic bishops and by the Cuban government.  </P> <P> The Polish-born John Paul is applauded throughout Eastern Europe as a symbol of  the human rights struggle and an important catalyst for change.  </P> <P> Fidel Castro, Cuba's Marxist president, has adamantly rejected perestroika in  the Soviet Union that has made change possible in East Europe, but of late, he  has muted a longstanding antagonism toward religion.  </P> <P> Precise dates and details for the Cuba trip are still being worked out, Navarro  said, but the Vatican expects that the pontiff will arrive in Havana around  Dec. 9. He is expected to travel throughout the country, visiting each of the  seven Cuban dioceses.  </P> <P> If he follows his usual pattern, the Pope will also meet privately with Castro,  with Cuban intellectuals, with the diplomatic corps and with leaders of other  churches.  </P> <P> Under Communist rule since 1959, Cuba is the largest Roman Catholic country and  the last major Western Hemisphere country that has yet to be host to a visit  from John Paul.  </P> <P> The 69-year-old John Paul, in the 11th year of his papacy, usually makes four  foreign trips each year. The addition of Cuba makes six for 1990.  </P> <P> In January, the Pope visited five Sahel countries in West Africa. After his  Czechoslovakia visit, he will begin a new round of visits to Latin American  countries in Mexico on May 6. At the end of May, he goes to Malta, and in  September he returns to Africa, before completing his busiest travel year with  the Cuban visit.  </P></p>

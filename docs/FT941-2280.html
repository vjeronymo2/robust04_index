			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / Patten halts reform tide for schools No more education legislation is planned for England and Wales in the lifetime of this parliament, Mr John Patten, the education secretary, said yesterday. Mr Patten's pledge was interpreted as an attempt to pacify teachers' unions, which are still considering a boycott of this summer's national curriculum tests. He said the legislation to set up a quango for administering teacher training was 'the last major piece in the jigsaw' of a new settlement for education which has been introduced by successive acts of parliament since 1988. Education department officials said several measures to widen the scope of nursery education would still be possible. But significant changes to the system controlling primary and secondary schools would not be possible. The announcement appears to rule out speculation that the government could force all schools to opt out of local authority control. This would require primary legislation. Financial incentives for schools to opt out will be increased, however. Mr Patten also announced an extension of the government's specialist colleges plan, which will not be open to local authority schools. He said: 'By the autumn I hope to be in a position to invite bids from those wishing to set up business and language schools specialising in three or more foreign languages linked to business studies.' He said that the scheme, to run on the same lines as the technology colleges announced earlier this month, would produce 'youngsters able to make the most of the opportunities offered by the single European market'. Schools would be required to raise Pounds 100,000 from business sponsors, which would be matched pound-for-pound by the government. Mr Patten hopes to invite bids for schools to become specialist sports colleges at the same time, although business interest has been harder to define. Mr Nigel de Gruchy, general secretary of the National Association of Schoolmasters/Union of Women Teachers reacted angrily. He said: 'It is profoundly unhelpful to suggest that some schools specialise in languages, business studies, sports and so forth. All schools should offer these and other subjects. The Standing Conference on Schools' Science and Technology launched a scheme which will aim to help 2,000 primary school teachers each year in teaching science and technology. Ciba, the Swiss chemicals company which is underwriting the scheme, said it was concentrating on primary schools because many teachers were not fully qualified in science.</p>

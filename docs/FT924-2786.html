			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / Survey of Software at Work - Winter 1992 (14): Higher productivity with lower cost - Architectural user view ARCHITECTS at Yakeley Associates need high quality graphical presentations to impress a varied customer base. In the public sector alone, Yakeley's tasks can vary from the refurbishment of an office block to the creation from start to finish of a Pounds 45m courthouse. Like many architectural firms, Yakeley faced the problem of productivity. With a staff of 18 and a turnover of about Pounds 700,000, the company saw computer-aided design as a way of increasing efficiency and improving presentation skills, without having to spend a crippling amount on technology. Just as important was the time and effort that would have to be invested in learning, so easy-to-use software was a high priority. 'The advent of the Macintosh made the technology affordable for us,' comments town planner Ian Kime. 'We originally bought our Mac for word processing, but started to invest in drawing packages.' Yakeley looked at Macdraft, and other contemporary offerings, including AutoCAD and Architrion, but settled for a US-based package, MiniCAD. The Yakeley team was unimpressed by what it saw as unnecessary complexity.' He adds: 'The MiniCAD package was straightforward, and used the Mac interface very well. In addition, it was one-quarter the price of anything else we looked at. 'Since we installed the system in 1986, the software has developed and we have also developed with it. The primary aim is to get the lines on the paper as cheaply and efficiently as possible - nothing else really matters.' THE Yakeley users are all self-taught novices, more at home with the Architects Journal than the computer trade press. However, Ian Kime has been quick to spot ways in which the use of CAD software can further benefit the practice. 'Compatibility is critical in relation to the construction industry today,' he says. 'The one thing we have to do is to talk electronically with other consultants, exchanging drawing files with structural engineers and consultants.' MiniCAD allows them to exchange data through a Data Exchange Facility, DXF, so that details of drawings can be taken off disc, worked on, and returned in their original for mat. This saves errors in copying, and time in reproducing data. Although MiniCAD has speeded up the production of drawings, especially when dealing with features that are repeated many times in one building, its benefits have been much more widespread. They include the ability to target and present services better, for example in the customisation of brochures produced for a particular market sector. 'We have expanded our range of services,' says Mr Kime. 'We don't wait for people to knock on our door, we take a pro-active approach, developing the client's needs, defining them, and developing the brief with the client. Essentially, the computer allows us to prototype buildings. His colleague Mr Yeates agrees that there have been benefits in focusing the architects' talents on the client's specific needs. 'We can now model all the important parameters, and suggest the best building for the particular conditions, focusing on the particular needs of that site or contract. 'Also, the technology affects the discipline and working procedures, keeping track of who is working on what. 'Productivity is greater - which is good for our clients - because we can produce more drawings for the same price.' PRODUCT PROFILE MiniCAD Suppliers: Diehl Graphsoft, developer of MiniCAD, was founded in the US in 1985. Gomark, in London SW6, distributes the product in the UK. MiniCAD can be used as a 2-D draughting package, or in 3-D to design, visualise and present entire schemes. It can be used as a basis for analytical studies in design. MiniCAD+ Version 4.0 was launched in 1992 by its US-based developer, Diehl Graphsoft. The system combines easy-to-use classic 2D drafting, interactive modelling, built-in spreadsheet and database tools with high-quality graphic output and the ability to export data to other programs and systems. Price: Pounds 595 plus VAT Hardware and operating systems: Apple Macintosh Sales and support/ maintenance: Available in the UK from Gomark. Other services include training, available shortly from Gomark. User views: Pros: 'Low cost, easily integrated with other applications.' Cons: 'Needs a great deal of storage capacity.'</p>

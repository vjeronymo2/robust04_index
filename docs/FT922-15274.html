			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / Harrisons &amp; Crosfield pays Pounds 67m for Unilever unit HARRISONS &amp; Crosfield, the UK conglomerate, is paying Pounds 67m in cash for BOCM-Silcock, Unilever's animal feeds business. It will be merged with Pauls Agriculture, H&amp;C's animal feeds subsidiary. Unilever will suffer a loss on the deal as BOCM is valued at Pounds 85m in its books, having been written down from more than Pounds 100m. H&amp;C, which has interests in chemicals, timber and building supplies, and plantations as well as animal and human food, announced the purchase with its 1991 results which showed a fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 106.1m to Pounds 71.2m. It also maintained its annual dividend at 9p although it is not covered by earnings per share of 7p, down from 11.6p. Unilever put most of its agribusiness division on the market in February, and said losses on disposals would be covered by a Pounds 60m extraordinary charge made in the 1991 accounts. BOCM-Silcock, which has 22 feed mills in the UK, is the largest of the businesses Unilever is selling. The sale to H&amp;C includes Unitrition, an oil miller, and Fulmar, a Scottish fish-feed maker. The combined businesses had sales of Pounds 300m in 1991 and made pre-tax profits of Pounds 5.1m. However, H&amp;C said on its accounting policies the business would have made Pounds 11.1m, because Unilever charges the subsidiary for head office services. On this basis, the multiple H&amp;C is paying is 9.3 on a 35 per cent tax charge. Mr George Paul, chief executive of H&amp;C, said Unilever had spent heavily on its mills but they were working below full capacity. He said combining the 22 Unilever mills with the 11 which H&amp;C owns would mean closures but would give H&amp;C market leadership and economies of scale. He said BOCM had 15.5 per cent of the market while H&amp;C had 8.5 per cent. The deal is subject to clearance by the competition authorities. Mr Paul expected the deal to add 0.3p to H&amp;C's earnings per share in 1992, after financing costs, when it would own BOCM for seven months, and 1.3p to earnings in 1993. The purchase would increase H&amp;C's gearing from 38 per cent at the end of 1991 to 52 per cent. H&amp;C planned to sell non-core businesses bringing gearing down again. Unilever shares fell 2p to 896p while H&amp;C shares rose 2p to 126p. Lex, Page 20; Details, Page 24</p>

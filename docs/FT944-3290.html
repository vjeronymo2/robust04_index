			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / People: Deputy md for Pearson Pearson, the media and entertainment group and owner of the Financial Times, announced yesterday that David Veit is to become deputy managing director with group-wide responsibilities. Veit, 56, has been with Pearson since 1961 and for the past 20 years has been the senior Pearson executive in the US. He joined Pearson after graduating from Oxford and later obtained an MBA from Stanford University. The move is designed to give some support for Frank Barlow, the Pearson managing director who turns 65 in March. It could also signal the likely succession, although Lord Blakenham, the Pearson chairman said yesterday: 'I am glad to say that Frank Barlow has no immediate retirement plans. David's appointment marks a welcome strengthening of our senior management team in London.' Veit, who was involved in the development of Pearson's publishing and other activities in the US, will continue to live in New York while spending an increased amount of time at head office in London.</p>

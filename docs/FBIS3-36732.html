Recordings are  usually shown at 0600 [0300 GMT] and 0900 local time, but at  those times this morning a testcard appeared accompanied by  audio of Uzbek radio. Programs later were broadcast according  to schedule. An RIA correspondent was told at the television  and radio company of Uzbekistan that this was done by the  Ostankino company, which has announced cuts in broadcasting from  19 to 8.5-9 hours per day, because of a shortage of funds and  debts to communication workers.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Stepanakert, April 10 (SNARK)--Today at dawn  Azerbaijani units, supported by a large number of tanks and  other military hardware, went over offensive. The offensive was  assumed in the north part of Karabakh front in the direction of  Tonashen settlement (Mardakertskiy region). SNARK was informed  of this in the Karabakh Defence Army Headquarters.    Before the attack the Karabakh Forces defending that part of  the confrontation line had been shelled.    At 10 a.m. hard fights took place here. The Karabakh Defence  army units manage to repel the massed attacks of the Azerbaijani  units.    The Karabakh leaders are of the opinion that the official  Baku is deliberately increasing tension in the conflict zone  just before the summit talks being prepared by the Russian  Foreign Affairs Ministry, and a new meeting of CSCE Minsk group,  which starts today in Prague. Baku still relies on force  methods, once again defying the World Community, which makes  efforts to settle the problem by peaceful means.</p>

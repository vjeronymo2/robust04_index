			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / International Company News: St Paul to take write-down on Minet ST PAUL Companies, the Minnesota-based property-casualty insurer, is planning to write down the value of its large, but troubled London-based insurance broking subsidiary, Minet Group, which was acquired by the US parent in 1988. St Paul said yesterday that it intended to take a write-down of a portion of goodwill associated with the group as a non-cash charge against its fourth-quarter earnings. The US company did not specify the size of the write-down, but said this would be 'material' and result in the operating loss for the group in both the fourth quarter and for the year overall. In the first nine months of 1992, the US company reported total operating earnings of Dollars 92.5m. St Paul bought out the 74 per cent of Minet which it did not already own for around Dollars 515m in 1988. At the end of September this year, the carrying value of Minet-related goodwill was put at Dollars 482m. The Minnesota-based parent has made no secret of the problems within its insurance broking division, which employs around 4,000 people and has about 100 branch offices, recently. Reporting third-quarter results - which also bore the adverse impact of Hurricane Andrew - Mr Douglas Leatherdale, St Paul's chairman, said that Minet had proved 'a major disappointment', and generated 'substantial' losses in the first nine months of the year. On a pre-tax basis, Minet's deficit was put at Dollars 32.1m for the third quarter, and Dollars 51.7m for the first three quarters. As a result, efforts to restructure the Minet business are underway. According to St Paul, these concentrate on reducing the number of profit-centres, so that back-office facilities and support staff can be streamlined; putting more emphasis on a 'country-based' structure, rather than operating by product line; and also emphasising specific, specialised product areas, such as professional liability. Nevertheless, some analysts have cautioned against expecting a rapid turnround in the brokerage business, given the weakness of premium volume in international insurance markets.</p>

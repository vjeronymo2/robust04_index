Ho Chong, deputy chief of the North Korean mission to the  United Nations, explained Pyongyang and the IAEA's agreement to  Tom Hubbard, U.S. deputy assistant secretary of state for Asian  and Pacific affairs, who welcomed the accord.    C. Kenneth Quinones, North Korea desk officer at the State  Department, and Han Song-yol, councilor of the North Korean  mission to the world body, accompanied Hubbard and Ho.    Details of the working-level talks were not known  immediately, but diplomatic sources here said that the two sides  agreed to continue meeting to negotiate the third round of  high-level talks. The U.S. side emphasized, however, that a key  precondition of the high-level talks is the IAEA's satisfaction  with the results of its inspection of North Korean nuclear  sites, according to the sources. After the talks on Tuesday, Ho  said, "We will continue meeting (with the United States)."    Sources expected the two sides to discuss the agenda, dates  and preconditions of the third round of North Korea-U.S.  high-level talks through frequent meetings in New York.    Hubbard said he welcomed North Korea's acceptance of the  IAEA  inspections, but added that Tuesday's working-level talks are no  more than a small departure.    Ho said, "Today's talks were held in a friendly and  productive atmosphere. I don't think there is any tension  caused by the nuclear problem. The tension has been created by  the United States and press of the West."</p>

			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: EC move to protect consumers opposed THE GOVERNMENT is to continue to resist attempts by the European Commission to include financial services in a new EC directive on distance selling, Baroness Denton, consumer affairs minister, told the House of Lords last night. She maintained that financial services would not fit well in the framework of the regulation. It was designed to provide greater protection for consumers as the single European market and developments in telecommunications led to more products being sold across national borders. Lord Peston, from the Labour front bench, and Lord Thomson of Monifieth, for the Liberal Democrats, both argued for the inclusion of financial services in the scope of the new directive, but Lady Denton stressed that the sector was already subject to detailed regulation at both national and EC level. She accepted that there might well be a case for providing further protection for consumers, but insisted that this could best be achieved by building on measures already in force or being developed. Lady Denton also warned against plans to give consumers an automatic refund on any disputed credit card sale where proper electronic identification of the card itself had not been made. The EC draft directive would mean that a telephone sale by credit card should be void if challenged by the cardholder. Baroness Denton said: 'The government understands the need for safeguards against abuse of credit cards, but everyone is concerned that the current provisions in the proposal are too heavily loaded in favour of the consumer.' The draft directive also addresses the question of unsolicited advertising by fax, stressing the need for privacy, but with no firm proposals.</p>

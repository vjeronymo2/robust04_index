			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with 'Abd-al-'Aziz 'Abd-al-Ghani, member of the </F> Presidential Council in Sanaa, by Sawsan Abu-Husayn in Cairo;  date not given]    [Excerpts] [Abu-Husayn] It is expected that Security  Council states may recognize the Democratic Republic of Yemen  [DRY] in the near future. How will you deal with this reality?    ['Abd-al-Ghani] First of all, the Security Council's  position is very clear through Resolution 924, which proceeds  from the UN Charter and stipulates the independence and  sovereignty of the state, that is the Arab Republic of Yemen  proclaimed on 22 May 1990. Besides, in one of its drafts, the  resolution stipulates that it is an application of Article 34.  This was omitted because it concerns disputes between two  states or more. So the resolution talks about what is happening  in the Republic of Yemen. There is no indication at all that  the recognition question is on the cards.    [Abu-Husayn] Recognition is on the way, as southern leaders  say, because of Sanaa's rigidity and failure to comply with the  Security Council resolution. What is your opinion?    ['Abd-al-Ghani] That is untrue. Sanaa complied with and  implemented Resolution 924. Actually the fighting was halted  for six hours the first time, but the other side violated it.  On the eve of the blessed 'Id al-Adha and on the occasion of  the unity's fourth anniversary our legitimate forces complied  with the cease-fire, but Aden did not, and announced the  secession. The fourth time, we complied, but Aden announced its  decision to form a government.    We are the legitimate government, and it is in our interests  to have a cease-fire. But it is in the rebellious side's  interests to continue to fight and to keep the issue alive on  the front pages of newspapers. And it is in its interests for  the United Nations to continue to issue statements and  resolutions, while we complied and welcomed the UN secretary  general's envoy, Lakhdar Brahimi, and we sent our delegation to  Cairo to engage in a dialogue, and we conceded some of the  demands we had stressed.    [Abu-Husayn] Like what?    ['Abd-al-Ghani] That the dialogue should not be conducted in  the tripartite coalition framework, but, rather, in the Republic  of Yemen framework in implementation of the Security Council  resolution, but the southern leadership refused because it  wanted the meeting to be held in the framework of two states.  [passage omitted]    [Abu-Husayn] What is your opinion of your bombardment of  cities and residential areas and killing of civilians?    ['Abd-al-Ghani] First of all, we are not targeting any  citizen, civilian or military. This war is imposed on us by  some Socialist Party leaders, not all of them. Because the  Socialist Party is unionist, and it had the honor of signing the  unity agreement with the General People's Congress. This is why  I say that the rebels in the south are using civilians as human  shields for military purposes and so that public opinion will  sympathize with them. I wonder here: What view does public  opinion take of shelling Sanaa with the internationally banned  Scud missiles, which claimed the lives of 23 citizens? [passage  omitted]    [Abu-Husayn] Despite all you say, the siege is imposed on  Aden, and there are northern intentions to burn it.    ['Abd-al-Ghani] That is untrue. We will not burn Aden,  because Aden has not responded to the secessionists. It has  expelled them, and they now live in world capitals and in safe  areas. All governorates of the Republic of Yemen reject these  people, who have rebelled against legitimacy and portray  themselves as the victims.    [Abu-Husayn] But the people of the south celebrated the  DRY's proclamation on 22 May 1990.    ['Abd-al-Ghani] That is untrue. That state and its  leadership were not set up through elections or a referendum.  So we wonder: Under what legitimacy does it rule or represent  the people of the south?    [Abu-Husayn] It seems that the dispute is not over unity,  but, rather, the way in which it was established, because the  south has not ignored the unity, and some southern leaders say  that secession has been imposed on them.    ['Abd-al-Ghani] True, no Yemeni will dare reject the unity.  And if the dispute is over the form of the unity, why have  southern leaders rejected the new formulas which we spent months  negotiating? I was a member of the dialogue committee with  Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas, and we reached the Pledge and Accord  Document by dint of strenuous efforts and continued dialogues,  but southern leaders rejected this document.    [Abu-Husayn] But they are demanding that Sanaa comply with  the stipulations of the document, saying that the southern state  was established on the basis of the principles stipulated in it.    ['Abd-al-Ghani] That is designed for public opinion.  [passage  omitted]    [Abu-Husayn] I ask you again, and I want a specific answer:  Is it possible to return to a unified state in these conditions?    ['Abd-al-Ghani] Why not? Yes, it is possible, provided the  people of Yemen are left alone. We are confident that, if that  happens, we will find solutions to problems, because what  complicates the problem is internationalizing and Arabizing it.  Thus we urge the brothers and friends to focus their efforts on  supporting unity, and to stop supporting one group against  another. They should support the wish of the Yemeni people, who  welcomed unity on 22 May 1990.    [Abu-Husayn] Will the abolition of the southern state be  among the solutions?    ['Abd-al-Ghani] Yes, the southern state should be abolished,  and unity between the two peoples, not two states, established.  I requested a meeting yesterday with the brothers from the  Socialist Party, especially Salim Salih, who was in Cairo, but  he left Cairo and refused to meet with me because he wanted the  meeting to be held on the basis of two states -- which is  unacceptable. [passage omitted]    [Abu-Husayn] The south believes that Resolution 924 means  halting the fighting first and then engaging in a dialogue.    ['Abd-al-Ghani] That is true, but in addition to a phrase  which says, in the framework of the Republic of Yemen. We are  willing to do that, and I announce through AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT  that we accept an immediate halt to the fighting as of this very  moment, and the time now is 6:30. But I have to receive a  telephone call from the other party, announcing its acceptance  of this, then we would agree on an unconditional dialogue and on  the first matter, that is, a halt to the fighting. The second  matter is dialogue: let us negotiate everything within the  framework of the Republic of Yemen, legitimacy, and the Security  Council resolution. [passage omitted]    [Abu-Husayn] How will you deal with the Security Council  resolution if they are stepped up to the point of imposing  sanctions?    ['Abd-al-Ghani] We have not committed a crime for us to be  punished, nor have we fought anyone outside our borders.    [Abu-Husayn] What about the results of your meeting with  Lakhdar Brahimi in Cairo?    ['Abd-al-Ghani] The meeting was very good. We spoke about  the importance of implementing the Security Council resolution,  I stressed Sanaa's readiness for that, and we agreed to continue  consultations and contacts.    [Abu-Husayn] With regard to the Arab League's role, do you  want it to continue its endeavors?    ['Abd-al-Ghani] Why not? Especially as the League has said  from the outset that what is happening in Yemen concerns the  Yemenis.    [Abu-Husayn] What is the position of both Iraq and Iran  toward you, especially in light of the accusations that they are  supporting you militarily?    ['Abd-al-Ghani] First of all, Iraq is currently being  subjected to an embargo, and if an ant moves out of it, it is  under close watch. Second, we are capable of protecting unity  and need not import people to defend our unity.    As for Iran, it supports unity politically, and we welcome  the position adopted by it or by any other state.</p>

			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets: Bangkok pulls back from 1,000 barrier - One bad news item after another has forced the SET index down Only a month ago the Stock Exchange of Thailand index, comfortably supported by strong corporate earnings growth, seemed poised to celebrate the market's bull run by breaking through the 1,000-point barrier. In the past few weeks, however, one bad news item after another has conspired to force the index down. From a peak of 998.44 in January, the SET index fell to 910.52 on Monday this week before staging a moderate recovery yesterday to 922.48. 'It is funny how quickly a market can lose 10 per cent,' said one stockbroker in Bangkok yesterday. The first blow to confidence was the closure of First City Investment, a listed finance and securities company which ran out of money and suspended payment of mature promissory notes. Although the company was regarded as badly managed, and although the Bank of Thailand, the central bank, has arranged a rescue, some local investors remembered the market fall which followed the collapse of Raja Finance 13 years ago and feared that there would again be knock-on effects from the closure. The mood was not helped by mutterings about a possible dispute within the Democrat Party, which leads the coalition government, over whether to save FCI or not; Ms Patcharee Wongpaitoon, the wealthy businesswoman at the helm of the company, is the daughter of a former Democrat leader. Nor was sentiment improved by the comments of a frustrated opposition MP who called for a military coup d'etat during a dispute over the 1993 budget. Meanwhile, the authorities have been continuing their painfully slow attempts to prosecute Mr Song Watcharasriroj, a leading player in the market better known as Sia Song, for illegal share price manipulation. The gloomy assumption among the local speculators who account for most of the SET's turnover is that the regulators have so much egg on their faces over the mishandling of the Sia Song and FCI affairs - it turns out that the central bank knew of FCI's bad debt problems by the middle of last year - that they will redouble their efforts to tighten controls on the market. Questions were already being raised about the quality of FCI's accounts when Siam Cement, the largest cement producer in Thailand, disclosed that its audited 1992 net profit of Bt3.56bn (Dollars 140m) was Bt400m below the unaudited figures announced earlier, as well as being below the 1991 profit of Bt3.89bn. The share price fell sharply. Another unsettling factor for the SET has been the suggestion that the widespread premiums for the limited number of shares that can be legally held by foreigners will disappear if the authorities approve a plan to set up a trust fund to keep shares for foreign investors. As if all this were not enough, news dribbled out that the board of Bangkok Bank, the largest bank which accounts for about 5 per cent of the entire market capital-isation, had approved an eventual doubling of its registered capital to Bt20bn and was planning a three-for-10 rights issue this year. The disappointment among investors was palpable. They had believed that commercial banks were generating enough money from their record profits to avoid such calls for fresh capital and dilution of earnings; and since Bangkok Bank was the market leader, the others were bound to follow. Banks shares account for about a quarter of the SET index, and their behaviour has been partly responsible for the rise - and the recent fall - of the index. Several bank share prices have tripled in the past 18 months, prompting some brokers to suggest that the market's recent decline is no more than a timely correction. Many brokers predict in any case that by the end of the year the index will reach 1,100 or 1,200 because earnings growth remains so strong across the economy. Yesterday was perhaps a typical day. With the tourist trade dented by the political violence last May, the Oriental Hotel reported a fall in profits in 1992. But Land and Houses, a property company, announced net profits 75 per cent up at Bt1.24bn; Charoen Pokphand Feedmill was up 30 per cent to Bt1.19bn; and Nation Publishing was 52 per cent higher at Bt184.5m. Most companies in Europe and Japan can still only dream of results like that.</p>

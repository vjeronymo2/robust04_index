After omitting answers such as "I don't know," the following  institutions were deemed most trusted by Slovaks: Army,  president, Church, unions, Police, Parliament, courts, and  prosecutor, and, lastly, the government.    The research showed a higher level of mistrust than trust in  state bodies. Only two out of eight institutions earned more  trust than mistrust: the Army and the president.</p>

			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / People: Policy Studies Institute Pamela Meadows, chief economics adviser and head of the economics, research and evaluation division at the Department of Employment, becomes the next director of the Policy Studies Institute from the beginning of October. She takes over from Bill Daniel, who has been in the job for seven years, and who is stepping down, aged 54, to devote more time to his own area of research expertise - employment and industrial relations. 'If I were asked to describe my ideal job, this would be it,' says Meadows, 44, simply. After 19 years in the Civil Service, she says the appeal is presiding over a body of work that is 'at the interface between very respectable academic research and work which influences the policy agenda'. PSI has a permanent staff of 70 people, with some 50 full-time researchers, and calls itself Britain's leading independent social research institute. Annual turnover is around Pounds 2.5-3m and it has a forward order book of about 12 months. She happens to have known Daniel for 15 years; one of her first tasks when she joined Employment was to manage a project that Daniel was doing. Her government department is a significant funder of PSI - notably contributing to the recent Employment in Britain Survey. As well as developing the research side, part of her job will be to extend current sources of funding, encouraging more involvement from industry and putting together consortia of donors for the bigger projects.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Alain Juppe drew the lessons  learned from the European elections in the National Assembly  this afternoon. Juppe observed that the debate over Europe was  far from over. However, he is still working hard for the opening  up of European Union [EU] membership to East European countries  with the exception of Russia:    [Begin Juppe recording] This expansion of the EU seems to me  necessary. It is necessary because we have promised it. For  more than 40 years we have been telling these countries: When  you have thrown the yoke of communism, once the Berlin Wall and  the Iron Curtain have fallen we will welcome you into the  European family that is yours. It would seem to me absurd and  dangerous if we do not keep this promise. I would add this  argument, which may be contested, but which I believe to be very  strong: If we reject such a development the Franco-German  partnership would not withstand it. What would the EU be if  Germany took a different direction? This does not mean that we  should follow anyone blindly, but it is about whether we  continue to maintain Franco-German relationa as one of the  cornerstones of the European construction. If the answer is  yes, then we should -- for so many reasons and particularly for  this one -- continue moving toward an expanded Europe. [end  recording]</p>

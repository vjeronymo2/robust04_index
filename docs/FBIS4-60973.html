			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Viktor Belikov: "Passengers Moving from </F> `Ikarusz' to German `Neoplan'"]    [Text] A comfortable and maneuverable 15-meter city bus  with three wide doors and a passenger capacity of 150 will be a  new sight on the capital's roads next year. It will be produced  under license from the well-known German firm of "Neoplan."    The decision to set up a joint venture in conjunction with  the "Avtobus-ZIL" closed-type, joint-stock company was made 28  April by the Moscow City Government. Fifty-one percent of its  shares will be held by the "ZIL" Moscow Automobile Company, with  the rest being held by the Moscow Committee for the Management  of State Property. There is very high demand for a Russian-made  vehicle of this type. Moscow alone will require no less than  1,000 a year. The city's bus fleets are currently short  2,400-2,500 vehicles.    The Hungarian "Ikarusz," which currently have to be bought  for foreign exchange, are obsolete and leave us dependent on  shipments of spares from abroad. Moreover, Moscow's motor  industry enterprises have found themselves in a difficult  financial and economic position, and the city authorities took  this into account in deciding to support the "ZIL," not with  preferential hand-outs or tax breaks, but with a major long-term  production program.    As Yu. Luzhkov reported at the session, "ZIL" specialists  made their choice of the basic model suitable for our conditions  after looking at examples from around the world -- from France  to Japan. The German firm's proposal was the most acceptable in  terms of its technical characteristics as well as from the  standpoint of foreign exchange expenditure. The "Neoplan"  license plus the purchase of components to produce the first  batch of 150 buses in 1994-95 will cost 49.51 million German  marks. Off-site "ZIL" teams will begin assembling the vehicles  at the firm's plant in Pilsting (Bavaria), from where they will  be dispatched to Moscow.    Components and parts production will gradually move to "ZIL"  shops, and it is ultimately planned to supply the engines from  the Bashkir city of Ishimbay. Assembly of the new vehicles, V.  Saykin, first deputy general director of the "ZIL" Moscow  Automobile Company, said, will be launched in the modernized  wing of one of the capital's unused motor vehicle pools. The  motor vehicle plant intends to develop a whole family of  passenger vehicles based on the "Neoplan."</p>

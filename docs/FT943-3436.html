			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / 'Hard core' dissent: The chasm dividing the UK and its EU partners is getting deeper European for-eign minis-ters have den-ounced the controversial report by the German Christian Democrat party (CDU), which argued that there should be a minority 'hard core' at the centre of the European Union. Their show of disapproval may give temporary reassurance to the British, Italian and Spanish governments, which have expressed alarm at the thought that Germany might try to relegate them to the slow lane of Europe. But public denunciation cannot dispose of the thinking behind the CDU paper, because it has been shaped by the geopolitics of the new map of Europe. Unfortunately, geopolitics is the chasm which has long divided the British from most of their partners on the continent, and it now seems to be getting deeper. The six founders of the European Economic Community saw it from the start as an essentially geopolitical undertaking, of which the economic rules were just the practical expression; and for the Germans this imperative has been even stronger than for the other five. But even after 20 years of membership the British still do not understand this. They instinctively think that the 'common market' is just a trading arrangement, and believe it ought to become more like a loose free-trade area; whereas if the problem is geopolitics, the solution is Nato and the Americans. The authors of the CDU paper inevitably see the geopolitics of Europe in German-centric terms, and invoke the EU as a guarantee against historic German-driven instability on the continent. They argue that the institutional and law-based framework provided by the Treaty of Rome was essential after the second world war to stabilise West Germany inside western Europe, and they claim it is just as necessary today. The British pay lip-service to this peace-making function of the EU, but they discount 90 per cent of what the Germans are saying; they do not understand the German problem, because it is not a British problem. As a result, the British and the Germans draw opposite conclusions from the fall of the Iron Curtain. The British government is now trying to sweep away the original geopolitical underpinning for the EU, by pretending that that purpose has now been served and can be dispensed with. Here is what Mr John Major said last week in his William and Mary Lecture in Leyden. 'The European Community was born to end divisions in western Europe. It has succeeded. With Nato, it has given us peace and prosperity in our part of the continent, and made war unthinkable. The determination of the founding fathers has succeeded far beyond the estimations of most people in their time. Their vision was proved right for its age. But it is outdated. It will not do now.' The obvious inference is that the EU model is no longer needed. But if so, what then? Should the Treaty of Rome and all its institutional trimmings now be scrapped? Or does Mr Major merely mean that we do not need any additional political integration of that kind, because now we have peace in our time? If the old vision is in some unspecified way out-dated, what is the nature of the new vision? He does not say; the only thing he is firm about is that we must have lots of flexibility all round. The authors of the CDU paper take the opposite point of view. They argue that the opening up of Europe may reawaken all the historical dangers in central-eastern Europe, with Germany once more at the pivot of instability between east and west; and therefore Europe needs a politically integrated union even more than it did before. 'The only solution which will prevent a return to the unstable prewar system, with Germany once again caught in the middle between east and west, is to integrate Germany's central and eastern European neighbours into the (west) European postwar system, and to establish a wide-ranging partnership between this system and Russia . . . Hence, Germany has a fundamental interest both in widening the union to the east and in strengthening it through further deepening. Indeed, deepening is a pre-condition for widening . . . ' the report says. The central question, according to the CDU paper, is whether the EU 'is able and willing to become the main pillar of a continental order, alongside a democratised and once-again stable Russia, and in alliance with the US'. This will only be possible, it says, if we strengthen the political integration of the union; and one component of this strengthening will be a tight inner core of those countries which are most able and willing to go for integration. The merit of the CDU paper is that it sets out a broad-based strategy for tackling the enlargement of the EU to the east, in which the geostrategic starting-point is brought together with a mainstream integrationist approach to Europe. It is obviously not the only possible strategy for Europe, but it is clear and coherent, and it will be at least a stimulating starting point for the debate now erupting on the future of Europe. Mr Major's speech was evidently intended as a British counterblast. Unfortunately, its main characteristic was its evasiveness. He says we should rebuild 'cohesion and confidence' in the EU; but he does not say how. He says enlargement of the union to the east 'must extend to security arrangements'; but he does not say how, except, of course, that 'we must be flexible'. In fact this speech is largely waffle, from which it is impossible to deduce any operational strategy. And if the government does not have a strategy, it is mainly because it cannot or will not think in geopolitical terms.</p>

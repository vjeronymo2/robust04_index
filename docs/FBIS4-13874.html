			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Cairo AL-MUSAWWAR in Arabic on 15 April  publishes a 2,500-word report on an interview with a "repentant  filmmaker" who became involved with a regional scam that used  bribes to lure Arab artists into joining the Muslim  fundamentalist movement. The filmmaker, Anis 'Abd-al-'Ati, is  interviewed by 'Adil Sa'id.    'Abd-al-'Ati says that he studied film direction at the  Cinema Institute in Cairo from 1981 to 1986. He reveals that he  made one documentary during his student days that received some  media notice. Having left the institute without completing his  studies, 'Abd-al-'Ati traveled abroad in search of work:    "After I left the Cinema Institute, I went to Jordan to seek  my fortune. Then I went to Iraq. There, I thought of making a  film about Saddam Husayn and calling it 'Knight Faces Persia.'  I met 'Udayy, Saddam Husayn's son and head of the Olympic  Committee in Baghdad. I had with me some newspaper cuttings  about my career. 'Udayy was forthcoming. He made me a gift of a  Jeep-type vehicle full of books about Saddam Husayn's life and  career. However, the peace agreement between Iraq and Iran was  signed and the film project was discarded. I decided to return  to Egypt."    'Abd-al-'Ati then related an aborted attempt in "a  neighboring Arab country" to find a producer for a film about  the Palestinian issue. He then traveled to another country,  which he does not name, and was introduced to several people in  the advertising and recording business. Among them was Usamah  Bin-Ladin, the Saudi businessman that Egypt and other countries  blame for funding the fundamentalist movement and who currently  lives in Sudan. Another was Salih al-Sharif, who owns al-Muslim  Recording Company. 'Abd-al-'Ati expresses the belief that  Bin-Ladin actually "controls" al-Muslim company and that  al-Sharif is just a "front man."    'Abd-al-'Ati, making a 3,000-riyal per month [$600 or $700]  working for al-Muslim Company, began to follow the strict dress  code and lifestyle favored by his employers:    "Meanwhile, I went regularly to pray and perform religious  rites with them. I let my beard grow and donned a shorter dress  [a knee-length shirt-like dress favored by fundamentalists in  presumed imitation of early Muslims]."    'Abd-al-'Ati then met a friend of his employers, a mosque  preacher, 'Abd-al-'Aziz Hamdan, who asked him to preach in a  mosque. In his sermon, 'Abd-al-'Ati spun a lie about himself  being a world-renowned filmmaker persecuted by international  Zionism. The sermon was recorded and became an immediate hit  "all over the Gulf, Europe and America." 'Abd-al-'Ati finds it  "regrettable" that the public fell for this "yarn," but bemoans  the fact that he "did not receive one cent of the takings."    An acquaintance of Bin-Ladin, whom 'Abd-al-'Ati does not  name, then asked him to approach top Egyptian actors and  actresses with offers of five to 10 million pounds [$1.5 million  to $3 million] if they would renounce their careers and lead a  life of religion. 'Abd-al-'Ati says: "He offered to increase  the offer if they were ready to reform their ways and renounce  their careers."    The same, unidentified, acquaintance then seeks to involve  'Abd-al-'Ati in a wider scheme:    "He then revealed to me an impressive proselytization effort  -- Bin-Ladin's official scheme. He asked me to take charge of  the finances of Islamic groups and to run an office in London  for this purpose. He wanted me in this job for two reasons:  First of all, being an Egyptian, this would confuse the public  as to the identity of the real financiers. Second, they really  trusted me.    "Initially, 250 million [currency not specified] were  earmarked for that project. From experience, I tell you that  most of the money came from people who were unaware of how it  would be used, who thought they were just donating to some  charity."    'Abd-al-'Ati then fell out with the proselytization racket  because he failed to meet their expectations. In one instance,  'Abd-al-'Ati refused to meet with Shaykh 'Umar 'Abd-al-Rahman,  because of "fear," which he does not explain. In another, he  declines to get involved in a plan to bomb the Cairo synagogue:  "I met a man by the name of Muhammad Taha. I still remember  his face. He asked me to put him in touch with some of my  acquaintances because he planned to bomb the Cairo synagogue,  but I refused."    Miffed at this lack of enthusiasm, the Bin-Ladin group sent  'Abd-al-'Ati for further education:    "My punishment was tactical. I received orders to move to  another area [not further specified] for nine months of further  education in religious matters and to do some soul-searching.    "There, I made the acquaintance of 'Abdallah al-Jilali,  'Abdallah al-Jafir, and Salam al-'Awdah, all of them Bin-Ladin's  friends.    "After the nine months were over, I discovered that I was  given a one-way exit visa [mughadarah niha'iyah] from the  country [not further specified].    "Before I left, one of Bin-Ladin's friends asked me to take  some letters to Afghanistan and Pakistan. I then discovered  that, with the type of visa I was issued, I could not go back to  Egypt or stay where I was. When they asked me to go to  Afghanistan I began to fear for my life. I discovered that I  was part of a new game and was virtually stateless.    "I got the plane tickets after they explained to me the  circumstances that forced them to terminate my residency. My  travel itinerary was to take me to Damascus, then Tripoli in  Libya. From there, I was supposed to go to [Rached] Ghannouchi,  the extremist leader, in Tunisia. From there I was to go to  Algeria and then London.    "Once in Syria, laden with heavy suitcases and accompanied  by  my wife and son, an unexpected thing happened: An air embargo  was slapped on Libya. I must have been a bit of a spectacle  with my beard, clothes, and a top-to-toe-covered wife. My only  option was to go back to Egypt. I was surprised to find that  the Egyptians let me into the country without any problem."    Having entered Egypt unchallenged, 'Abd-al-'Ati somehow  traveled, also unchallenged, to the "same country" that gave him  the one-way exit visa. There, he got another job offer:    "Back in Egypt, I read all that the papers wrote about me  and  was shocked by the magnitude of the problem I had caused. A few  months later, I returned to the same country with my wife and  met the same people. They gave me a forged residence permit  that I still have here in my pocket.    "I went to give a lecture at an air base and there I met a  Sudanese commander named 'Abd-al-Rahim Hammad, who came to  collect donations. He offered me a job in the media, through  which I would attack Egypt and get paid $20,000. I learned that  Bin-Ladin had gone to Sudan."    'Abd-al-'Ati does not elaborate on his rift with the  Bin-Ladin scam. He simply states that he returned to Egypt and  relates the story of his estrangement with his wife, who went on  to marry someone else "having stolen the common-law marriage  certificate, a photocopy of which I still keep." This,  AL-MUSAWWAR writes, "ends the story of the repentant filmmaker."</p>

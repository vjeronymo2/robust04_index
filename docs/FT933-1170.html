			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / International Company News: Daimler to take DM1.5bn charge DAIMLER-BENZ, Germany's largest industrial company, will take a charge of DM1.5bn (Dollars 617m) against earnings in the third quarter of the current year to cover restructuring costs. This emerged in a document Daimler has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission - the regulatory body for the US securities industry - ahead of the listing of its shares on the New York Stock Exchange on October 5. The figure fleshes out comments by Daimler management on Friday, when the company reported a loss of DM949m for the first six months of the year. This was after restating its figures in line with US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (US GAAP) ahead of the listing. Mr Gerhard Liener, the group's finance director, said then the losses would be considerably worse at the end of the third quarter, as the costs of rationalisation had not yet been booked against profits. Mr Edzard Reuter, the group's chief executive, announced last week that a total of 43,900 jobs would go this year and next, taking the total shed between 1992 and 1994 to 60,000. All but between 3,000 and 4,000 of the cuts had been announced previously. The bulk of the jobs will be lost through 'natural wastage', although there will be redundancies at the Mercedes-Benz luxury car subsidiary and Deutsche Aerospace, the group's aerospace subsidiary. Analysts forecast the group will lose DM2bn for the year under US GAAP. Turnover is set to come close to DM100bn after DM98.5bn last year. Mercedes-Benz has agreed to acquire a 13 per cent stake in US-based Detroit Diesel Corp, the German car and truck manufacturer said, AP-DJ reports from Stuttgart. Mercedes, the motor division of Daimler-Benz, said it took the stake through its US subsidiary Diesel Project Development. The stake is valued at Dollars 40m, the company said.</p>

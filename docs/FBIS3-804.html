			<p>Language: <F P=105> Afrikaans </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Radio Pretoria Chairman Rev. Mossie van den </F> Berg by Radio Pretoria announcer -- live]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Van der Berg] Let us make an  appeal and direct a plea to all our people. Let us -- man,  woman and child across the breadth and length of our country --  throw in our weight behind the resistance strategy which the  National Front is in the process of getting off the ground, and  which we hope -- and I want to try and announce this at this  stage -- on Friday 25 March will reach a climax by what we have  decided to call, and which we will advertise during the coming  week, `Capital Day in Pretoria.' During the coming week the  National Front will start distributing information throughout  the entire country.    This will begin on 22 March -- from the furthest corners,  and  it will gradually move toward Pretoria, and on 25th of this  month we hope to -- for the first time -- stage a real  demonstration in Pretoria not only for our people's enemies to  see, but they must also feel it in their bodies that they cannot  provide security and safety for anybody in this country without  having satisfied the Boers regarding their own future.    My plea to all our listeners is: Let us stop flinging  accusations: let us -- with more resolve than ever before --  tackle and perform the task at hand shoulder to shoulder. As  far as we are concerned, it is a forgone conclusion: There is  no way that we will get involved in the election on 27 April.  Our task is to see to the resistance campaign and to muster the  force of the Boer people. Thank you very much.    [Announcer] Reverend, I just want to ask you. You have just  mentioned Capital Day on the 25th. What is going to happen on  that day, or is it premature to talk about that now already?    [Van der Berg] We are going to get every man, woman, and  child from throughout the country, and particularly from around  Pretoria, to come to Pretoria and show the world that if there  is one piece of soil on which the Boer nation can make an  undisputed claim, then it is Pretoria. And from that point the  freedom struggle must continue forward.    [Announcer] Where is this meeting going to take place?    [Van der Berg] We hope Pretoria will be too small [announcer  laughs]. But the nucleus of the meeting will be at Church  Square.    [Announcer] Rev. Mossie, thank you very much. We will get  more detail in the course of next week to give our people.</p>

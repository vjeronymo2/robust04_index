			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Guaranteed products start to multiply AS FINANCIAL companies try to persuade cautious investors to leave their traditional safe haven in the building society, guaranteed products are evolving at breakneck speed. The latest version from Citibank Life is a complex product which aims to counter some of the flaws in other guaranteed products - inflexibility and the lack of an income facility. The 'Stockmarket Bonus Bond' has strong similarities to Hypo Foreign &amp; Colonial's Protected Capital Plus, which was launched last summer. The guarantee occurs on a quarterly basis. If the FT-SE 100 Index rises over three months, investors receive part of the gain; if the index falls, their capital remains intact. Once a gain is locked in, it cannot be lost. The cumulative effect of these guarantees is to reduce the impact of stock market volatility sharply . But the investor does not receive all the rise of the Footsie, nor the yield on shares in the index. The proportion of Footsie's gain will vary from quarter to quarter; Citibank indicates a range of 45 per cent to 94 per cent. For the forthcoming quarter, the proportion will be a net 52.5 per cent (60 per cent for pension products). To add to the complications, one must then take account of the charges (which are 5 per cent initial and 1 per cent annual) and the bonus allocations. Investors will receive extra allocations for investing early (2.2 per cent before February 10, falling to 0.5 per cent before March 24), or for investing more than Pounds 10,000. So it is rather difficult to estimate exactly how well an investor will do. Citibank has found that over the past five years, an investment of Pounds 30,000 would have grown into Pounds 47,492 net of all charges and tax - but smaller investments will not have done as well because of lower allocation rates. All returns are paid net of tax which cannot be reclaimed, but basic rate taxpayers will face no further charge. Higher rate taxpayers will face a further liability, but can take advantage of top slicing relief, which allows the investor to divide the gain made on the bond by the number of years it has been held. The income facility allows investors to make regular withdrawals, for a minimum of Pounds 50, or irregular withdrawals, with a minimum of Pounds 250. If the market does not rise in a particular quarter, these withdrawals will cause the investor's capital to drop. The product is technically an insurance bond, so investors can withdraw 5 per cent of their capital a year with no immediate tax liability (there may be a tax charge on final encashment). Flexibility is an important aspect of the bond; the product rolls on indefinitely, and the investor can withdraw money at any time, although it is a long- term investment. Investors could be forgiven for being bemused by the product's complexity. It is hard to predict how it will work in practice. It seems, likely, however, that a top-rate taxpayer would still be better off buying a low-charging index fund, such as Gartmore's; this carries no guarantee but there is little point in buying any equity-based product unless you think the market will rise.</p>

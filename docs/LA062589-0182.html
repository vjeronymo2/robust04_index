			<p><P> June 25, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANALYSIS;  </P> <P> CHIP CONSORTIUM ESCALATES GLOBAL INDUSTRIAL RACE;  </P> <P> U.S. FIRMS PUT JAPAN ON NOTICE THAT THEY'LL FIGHT TO STAY COMPETITIVE IN THE  SEMICONDUCTOR MARKETPLACE  </P> <P> What's behind last week's unprecedented move by U.S. computer and semiconductor  leaders to form a company, called U.S. Memories Inc., to make memory chips?  </P> <P> The industrial equivalent of the arms race in which staying ahead in the  electronics industry is as critical to U.S. standing in the world as having the  fastest fighter plane was in the military arms race.  </P> <P> It's a peaceful competition for the most part -- although the Defense  Department has an abiding interest in the latest technology -- with Japan  instead of the Soviet Union as the United States' chief rival.  </P> <P> But above all, it's a tough competition -- so tough that even International  Business Machines, the largest computer company and a U.S. technological  leader, realizes it will be vulnerable without a healthy American electronics  industry around it.  </P> <P> "IBM and the U.S. information industry face intense competition," IBM's  President Jack D. Kuehler told the Senate subcommittee on competitiveness at  recent hearings. In electronics, particularly, Kuehler testified, "we are  concerned with the essential infrastructure of our industry, be it  semiconductor chips, or tools, or test equipment. This infrastructure is  important because semiconductor chips are at the heart of finished goods in  many industries -- appliances, automobiles, consumer electronics, medical  instruments and computers, to name a few," said Kuehler.  </P> <P> How can a microscopic memory chip, costing less than $20, be the "heart" of so  many products and industries? Because having the most advanced memory chips is  the real key to competitiveness, Kuehler explained in an interview at IBM's  headquarters in Armonk, N.Y. "A computer is only a package of the latest  technology," he said. "And competitiveness is not a matter of how many geniuses  your company has, but of price and performance" -- are you getting there first  with the most.  </P> <P> Kuehler, a 56-year-old engineer and IBM's chief technologist, is talking about  semiconductor advances that have brought increased performance at lower price  to computers -- and many other products -- in the last decade. Ten years ago,  the basic memory chip held 16,000 bits of information -- the rough equivalent  of 2,000 of the letters and numerals you are now reading. Today's standard chip  holds 1 million bits -- or roughly 120,000 letters and numerals. Yet the  1-million-bit chip costs no more today than the 16,000-bit chip did then --  and, allowing for inflation in the intervening years, costs far less.  </P> <P> Since a personal computer uses 150 memory chips, at a rough cost of $1,000 to  $2,000, it's clear that having the latest, cheapest and most powerful chips in  your machine can make all the difference. "The principle is the same whether  it's a workstation or a mainframe," says Kuehler. If you're behind, he says,  you're not delivering a competitive product at a competitive price.  </P> <P> So far, IBM has more than held its own in the memory chip race. In a month or  so it will ship computers with chips containing 4 million bits of information  -- the most advanced technology yet.  </P> <P> But other U.S. electronics companies have been devastated, as Japanese  competitors took the lead in semiconductors in the past decade.  </P> <P> It was money that did it. As recounted in "Competing for Control," a book on  electronics competition by Michael Borrus, U.S. companies cut back capital  spending in the 1974 recession but Japanese companies kept on building capacity  and so had the products to grab market share when business turned up in the  late 1970s. That was Japanese industry's entry into world semiconductor  markets.  </P> <P> By 1986 they had pulled ahead, following a competitive Armageddon in which  Japanese companies lost $4 billion and U.S. companies $2 billion in  semiconductor price wars. Many American companies retired from memory chip  production after that, hoping to buy their components from Japanese or other  suppliers.  </P> <P> But soon it became clear that Japanese suppliers were also competitors in  finished goods. NEC, now the largest maker of semiconductor components, is a  challenger in supercomputers. Hitachi, Toshiba, Fujitsu -- all powerful in  semiconductors -- are global competitors in computers, and telephones and  appliances.  </P> <P> So American firms had no choice but to keep up in memory chips, despite the  increasing expense of the technology, which requires extraordinary  vibration-free, dust-free factories.  </P> <P> Even IBM, which spends $6 billion a year -- 10% of its $60-billion annual  revenue -- on research feels the bills mounting. "To get the latest  semiconductor technology means making a commitment of $250 million to $500  million for a new plant," said Kuehler. "The financial gamble to remain  competitive is escalating at an awesome rate."  </P> <P> And IBM knows that whatever the cost of keeping up today, it will be higher  tomorrow as attempts to pack more information on microchips demands expensive  X-ray lithography -- a high-science process, explains Joseph Grenier of the San  Jose research firm Dataquest, in which X-rays thrown off by accelerating  electrons are used to imprint electrical circuits.  </P> <P> IBM already has spent $350 million on an X-ray lithography plant at East  Fishkill, N.Y., that will ultimately cost $1 billion.  </P> <P> But the U.S. effort -- IBM is the only American company pursuing X-ray  lithography -- pales beside that of Japan, where 15 companies are planning  X-ray lithography plants.  </P> <P> Why are the Japanese doing that? "Because they look down the road and see  future opportunities in all industries," says Jim George, vice president and  general manager of memory products at Motorola. Just as Kuehler says, they know  that spending the money to gain improved memory chips will yield world markets  for all sorts of finished products.  </P> <P> So last week, U.S. industry began pooling its resources to cope with the  challenge. Computer competitors IBM, Digital Equipment and Hewlett-Packard, and  the semiconductor rivals, Intel Corp, Advanced Micro Devices, National  Semiconductor and LSI Logic, put up $50,000 apiece to launch U.S. Memories., a  firm that will ultimately demand $500 million in equity financing, along with  an equal amount of borrowing.  </P> <P> </P> <P> May Be Questioned  </P> <P> The founding companies are calling for other partners to join, and the venture  already has the approval of Texas Instruments and Motorola, two persevering  U.S. semiconductor makers. They see, as does IBM which is licensing its most  advanced technology to the new firm, that the common effort is in the interests  of all because it builds an "infrastructure" capable of assuring business for  supplier firms and coming up with advances in manufacturing technology. It  promises, in short, that the semiconductor electronics industry doesn't go the  way of consumer electronics, which has practically disappeared in the United  States.  </P> <P> Still, the idea of direct competitors pooling resources is a departure in many  ways from U.S. industrial tradition, and may be questioned on antitrust  grounds. But some scholars hail the venture, seeing such cooperation as a  necessary shift for antitrust law from a national to a global focus.  </P> <P> Traditional antitrust thinking holds that consumers are better served by  numerous fractionated suppliers, say Thomas Jorde and David Teece, professors  at the UC Berkeley Schools of Law and of Business. "But in the world market,  with a great diversity of innovation and suppliers, Jorde and Teece write in  California Management Review, "consumers are more likely to be injured if U.S.  firms attempt to go it alone, and lose out, or if they do nothing." In that  case, Americans may end not only with fewer suppliers to the market, but also  with fewer U.S. jobs and higher prices.  </P> <P> Indeed, the industrial arms race is high stakes just like the military one --  but with the saving grace that peaceful competition yields more useful results.  To be sure, advances in memory chips can bring more proficient gimmickry -- a  more complex TV set, a hand-held VCR. But it also means computers that teach  reading to children and adults alike; it means a better heart monitor in the  hospital and a better pacemaker at home. It is, in short, a more worthy arms  race -- and a critical one for U.S. industry, which is why it launched a common  effort last week.  </P></p>

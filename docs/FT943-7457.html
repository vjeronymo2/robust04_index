			<p>940823 FT  23 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Meyer shake-out continues as Jewson chief resigns The management shake-out at Meyer International is continuing with the announcement yesterday that Mr Richard Reynolds is resigning as chairman and managing director of Jewson, Britain's biggest builders' merchants chain and the company's largest subsidiary. Mr Reynolds, 45, who joined Jewson at the age of 16, had been managing director of the subsidiary since 1986. He is also resigning as a main board director of Meyer. The company said that Mr Reynolds would be leaving on September 30 'to pursue other interests'. The company is thought to have regarded Mr Reynolds as a good operational manager, but not the right person to pursue the strategic development of the builders' merchants business which is expected to expand as construction demand increases. It is the third major board change to be announced at Meyer in less than a year. Mr Richard Jewson last autumn announced that he was quitting as chairman and chief executive of Meyer after the company decided to split the two roles in line with the Cadbury committee recommendations. Mr Jewson, who became chairman in 1991, said that he did not disagree with the board's decision to divide the two roles, but did not want to become a non-executive chairman, nor did he wish to go back to being chief executive, his earlier post. He was succeeded as chief executive by Mr John Dobby, managing director of Meyer since October 1991. Mr David Kendall, chief executive of BP Oil between 1985 and 1988 and chairman of Bunzl until last year, was appointed non-executive chairman of Meyer in April. Until a successor for Mr Reynolds is appointed, Mr Dobby will take over responsibility for running Jewson, which contributed 35 per cent of Meyer's turnover and 41 per cent of operating profits in the 12 months to end-March. Group profits for the year rose from Pounds 14.4m to Pounds 41.6m while sales increased by 10 per cent to Pounds 1.2bn. Jewson's operating profits rose by 78 per cent to Pounds 20.7m. Meyer said yesterday that sales at Jewson, helped by a rise in new housebuilding, were higher in the first four months of the current financial year than at the corresponding stage last year.</p>

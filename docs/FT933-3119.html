			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / International Company News: Avonmore ahead 16% to IPounds 11.2m AN EXPANSION programme worth IPounds 71m (Pounds 66.5m) during 1992 by Avonmore Foods, the Irish dairy and meat processor, was the main factor behind a 16 per cent increase in interim pre-tax profits to IPounds 11.2m, against IPounds 9.63m. Turnover rose 54 per cent to IPounds 514.7m (IPounds 335m) for the six months to July 3. Ten acquisitions and two joint ventures were completed last year, largely in the meat processing business where turnover advanced more than 2 1/2 times to IPounds 214.7m (IPounds 80.6m) and now accounts for more than 40 per cent of group sales. However meat division operating profits grew by only 22 per cent to IPounds 3.9m (IPounds 3.2m), reflecting the present very tight margins in the market. The company said: 'The overall performance of the meat division was affected by difficult trading conditions in the European market and the turnaround nature of the 1992 acquisitions.' Mr Brendan Graham, group secretary, said: 'Our meat business has grown very rapidly and six months is a short time for companies which are being turned around. 'But we believe we have put a good business together at a modest cost, and the fundamentals are good. We are selling good products into 25 countries. The focus for the division from now will be on integration and efficiency measures.' Further growth will come through in the second half from the IPounds 21.6m acquisition of the Birmingham area operations of Dairy Crest last July. As a result Avonmore is the UK's fifth largest liquid milk supplier with a 7 per cent share of the market. Interest charges increased 53 per cent to IPounds 6.71m (Pounds 4.37m), as a result of the acquisition programme. The composite tax rate increased from 10.2 per cent to 13.8 per cent, reflecting the ending of tax exemptions for co-operatives in Ireland, and a growing contribution from overseas subsidiaries which face higher rates. The tax charge was IPounds 1.55m, compared with IPounds 985,000. Earnings per share were 5.38p (4.74p). An interim dividend of 1.55p (1.45p) has been declared. Mr Liam Igoe of Goodbody Stockbrokers in Dublin forecast a year-end pre-tax profit of IPounds 29.1m and for earnings of 13.6p.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] REUTER and ATA agencies report that our Foreign  Minister Alfred Serreqi took the floor in the Conference on  European Stability, which is being held in Paris. Serreqi  stressed that our country wishes to be a model of the rights of  minorities in the Balkans. Despite the noise of the Greek  international machine, the Greek minority in Albania enjoys full  rights and freedoms, Serreqi stressed at the conference,  pointing out the announcements by the Pan-European high  commissioner regarding human rights.    We understand the interest and care of the Greek Government  for the Greek minority in our country and their situation, but I  want to avail myself of the opportunity to remind that the  manipulations that include the Greek minority and other  minorities in general are dangerous and unacceptable, Serreqi  stressed.    Minister Serreqi called on Greece to accept the Firenze  Protocol of 1913, which guarantees the borders of Albania. He  stressed that a fair solution of the Albanian question  constitutes an important issue in the Balkans. Out of 7 million  ethnic Albanians distributed in four Balkan countries, only half  of them live in Albania now, he stressed. Tirana fully supports  the principle of permanence of borders, and it requests  democratic space for Albanians in the neighboring countries, the  minister added.    Diplomats consider the question of the rights of the  Albanian  majority in Kosova a hot target for a broader conflict in former  Yugoslavia, Foreign Minister Serreqi stated at this conference.</p>

			<p><P> March 16, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> KRAFT JURORS TO BE SEQUESTERED AT HOTEL TO AVOID MEDIA INFLUENCE  </P> <P> Superior Court Judge Donald A. McCartin broke the news to jurors in the Randy  Steven Kraft murder trial Wednesday that they will be sequestered during their  deliberations. He also told them that the target date for that should be  mid-April.  </P> <P> Kraft, 43, a Long Beach computer consultant, is on trial in Santa Ana charged  with 16 murders. If convicted, his case would go into a penalty phase in which  prosecutors say they could present evidence that Kraft committed 29 other  murders in Southern California, Oregon and Michigan.  </P> <P> McCartin told the jurors that they will have single rooms -- instead of two  jurors sharing a room -- in a nice hotel and will be allowed visitors on  weekends.  </P> <P> "We rarely sequester anymore, but in the abundance of caution . . . I believe  this is the best way to assure you won't be exposed to any news media publicity  during your deliberations," McCartin told them.  </P> <P> The judge told the seven alternate jurors that he will place them on call  during the deliberations but warned them that they might have to return if the  trial moves into a penalty phase.  </P> <P> The judge also told the jurors that they could have a 4-day Easter holiday next  week, with testimony presented only on Monday. When they return March 27, the  judge said, he will listen to any of the members of the 10-woman, 2-man jury  for whom sequestering might pose a hardship.  </P> <P> The judge added that the jurors could set their own timetable during the week  on how long each day they want to deliberate but that he will not permit  deliberations on Saturdays or Sundays.  </P> <P> McCartin joked with the jurors about the sequestering arrangements, at first  telling them that they would be staying at the Bates Motel, the fictional motel  made famous in the "Psycho" movies. He also joked that those who are unmarried  will be permitted to place boyfriends or girlfriends on their visitors' list.  </P> <P> "But let's try to keep this to the immediate family," he said. "I don't want  you inviting your ninth cousins to the hotel for the weekend."  </P></p>

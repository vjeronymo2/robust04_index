			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / The Liberal Democrats in Brighton: Activists reject idea of pacts with Blair Liberal Democrat activists yesterday warned the leadership they would not tolerate pre-election deals with Labour. Amid growing controversy over the decision by senior party figures to abandon the policy of 'equidistance' from Labour and the Tories, delegates made clear that their implacable opposition to the present government could not be the precursor to an electoral pact with Mr Tony Blair, the new Labour leader. In spite of Mr Paddy Ashdown's refusal to join the debate, four members of his Westminster team yesterday joined those who ruled out sustaining the Conservatives in office after a general election. Mr Menzies Campbell, Mr Alan Beith, Sir Russell Johnston and Mr Alex Carlile said it was inconceivable that the party could prop up a minority Tory government. But senior party figures bowed to grassroots pressure to dismiss any idea of a pre-election deal with Labour. At a fringe meeting yesterday several delegates were warmly applauded after voicing animosity to Labour politicians on local councils. There was little support for senior party figures - including Baroness Williams and Lord Jenkins - who have openly supported Mr Blair's election as leader. The overwhelming majority of voters think the Liberal Democrats' policies are closer to Labour's than the Tories', says an opinion poll for BBC's Newsnight and The Independent. The poll of more than 1,100 voters throughout Britain found people no longer see the Liberal Democrats as 'equidistant' from Labour and the Conservatives. But a majority of supporters of both opposition parties oppose a pre-election pact against the Tories.</p>

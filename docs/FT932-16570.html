			<p>930405 FT  05 APR 93 / International Capital Markets: Foreign borrowers turn to US THE surge in issuance in the US corporate bond market, where underwriting volume reached a record level of more than Dollars 122bn in the first quarter, has been accompanied by a spate of financings by foreign borrowers in the US market. The so-called 'Yankee' bond market - the US market for foreign borrowers - reached record volume of nearly Dollars 7bn in the first quarter, according to IFR Securities Data. Although the market is still dwarfed by issuance in the dollar sector of the Eurobond market - close to Dollars 40bn in the first quarter, including global offerings - as well as the US corporate bond market, the Yankee bond market has proved a vital source of funding. For leading borrowers, there is little difference between financing costs in the US and the Eurobond markets. Frequently, the best way for them to minimise costs is to structure deals as global offerings, with placement in both the US and Europe, so that paper will flow towards the strongest bid. Consequently, borrowers such as Finland and Sweden, which might have considered tapping the Yankee market to meet heavy funding needs, launched global bonds instead. What the US market does offer, however, is a home for weaker credits which are not readily accepted in the Eurobond market. While Eurobond investors tend to demand exorbitant spreads for borrowers with credit ratings below the single-A band, US investors have considerable appetite for lower-rated debt. 'There is an ability to evaluate credit in the US market which is more advanced than in the Euromarket,' said Mr Charlie Berman, a director of Salomon Brothers in London. The appetite of US investors for lower-rated - and consequently higher yielding - bonds has been fuelled by the sharp decline in US interest rates. The prolonged rally in the Treasury market has pushed yields down to historic lows. Even now prices are off their highs, there is still demand for bonds, simply because investors do not want to leave funds on deposit or in the money markets because of the negligible returns on offer. The main beneficiaries outside the US of this appetite for yield fall into three main categories. First, some lower-rated companies have been able to fund themselves more cheaply than in their domestic markets. UK companies have been keen to access the market, often funding US subsidiaries in this way. In some cases, they have made use of the US Securities and Exchange Commission's rule 144A, which allows borrowers to issue tradeable securities in the private placement market without registering with the SEC. Bass and Hanson both raised large sums in the US market in the first quarter. Second, the market has attracted emerging countries such as Turkey and Korea, which are planning to return to the market shortly. Third, the market has proved a fruitful source of subordinated debt for banks, which need to shore up their capital to meet new international rules. Last week, Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Bank successfully placed a Dollars 300m 10-year issue, via J. P. Morgan, priced to yield 140 basis points over the comparable US Treasury. But much of the surge of issuance in the first quarter was created by Canadian provinces, which are trying to diversify their funding to meet heavy borrowing schedules. In spite of the growth of the Yankee bond market, the amount of paper issued in the private placement market under rule 144A is still below the expectations of three years ago, when the market was opened. Most investors still prefer SEC-registered paper, while insurance companies, which were always active in the private placement market, remain the mainstay of the 144A market. However, dealers have tried to improve liquidity in the sector by making markets in the paper, and there have been signs of a broadening of the investor base.</p>

			<p>920316 FT  16 MAR 92 / Fear and optimism among the Democrats: Candidates' differences are more shadings than broad colours WELL, 'if you could clone the best of each of them, you'd have a pretty good candidate'. Thus the voice of eternal optimism, and underlying fear, in the Democratic party, expressed by a young woman interviewed on TV after one of the latest in the series of debates, from Chicago, on Friday night. The point is valid. Bill Clinton, Paul Tsongas and Jerry Brown were civilised and serious; they jabbed at each other, but they did not maul; they tried to mix minutiae with message; distinctions between them did emerge, but they were painted more in shades than broad colours. Mr Bill Clinton, governor of Arkansas, as befitting the one with a formal job other than running for the nomination, probably showed the best command of detail. He certainly talked more than the other two. Whether the subjects were taxation or industrial policy, which they were a lot, or even foreign policy (there actually was a question about what to do about dictators around the world), Mr Clinton spoke with the greater precision both about his plans and what was wrong with the solutions offered by his opponents. Mr Paul Tsongas, the former senator from Massachusetts, basking in the endorsement of the Chicago Tribune that morning, kept emphasising that his economic policies were the most realistic. He repeated over and again his well-worn slogans that there was no longer a Santa Claus or candy store to take the public mind off the real problems of economic competitiveness with the likes of Germany and Japan. But he was constantly pressed by Mr Clinton on the fine print of his tax and investment proposals. Much the loosest of the three and much the most adept at the populist anti-Washington one-liner, Mr Jerry Brown, the previous governor of California, cheerfully bashed on with his message of the need for 'economic and social justice'. To him, this meant stopping the export of jobs to low-wage Mexico, introducing a flat 13 per cent rate income tax, a comprehensive new energy policy, the creation of 50 new enterprise zones, and the building of 'B2 bullet trains'. On the foreign policy question, Mr Clinton asserted that General Norman Schwarzkopf, the US Gulf war commander, was right and the allied troops should have fought on another few days further to weaken capabilities of the Iraqi Republican Guard. But, he added, 'we gave our word not to go to Baghdad' and that was correct. Pressed by Mr Tsongas that his stand on the war had been ambiguous, Mr Clinton insisted that whatever the prior mistakes of US policies in the region, President Bush was right to go to war and should not have been denied that right by the Congress. response meant that Mr Tsongas was left only with the observation that the US no longer needed as many troops as it now had in Europe. Mr Brown regretted the slaughter of Shias and Kurds in Iraq and complained about administration policy, but added that the real issue was the number of unemployed in Michigan. The state of the domestic economy is, relatively, Mr Tsongas' strong suit and he reminded everyone that, when in Congress, he was one of the 11 Democratic senators to vote against the Reagan-Bush tax cuts of 1982. Now, he said, the Democrats, by inference mostly Mr Clinton, were engaging in their own form of 'voodoo economics' by blithely promising unaffordable middle-class tax cuts. This induced Mr Clinton to accuse Mr Tsongas of a 'kinder, gentler form' of Reaganomics, and Mr Tsongas to charge that Mr Clinton refused to ask Americans to make any sacrifices at all. Both then engaged in a vigorous exchange about petrol taxes, leaving Mr Brown free to score most heavily by pointing out that the average 'working stiff' was always losing out through this sort of insider-policy debate. Mr Clinton asked Mr Brown to reconcile his previous support of a north American free trade zone with his vigorous opposition to it. Mr Brown replied that a regulated common market, as in Europe, was fine but a regime which merely allowed the export of American jobs to Mexico, because it was cheaper, was not. Mr Brown must have mentioned Mexico at least half a dozen times in the debate. The closing statements covered well-travelled territory, Mr Tsongas invoking Santa Claus and his own recovery from cancer, Mr Brown 'keeping the jobs here' and not, of course, in Mexico, and Mr Clinton promising 'a new kind of politics - putting people first'. There was, it should be said, no mention of the 'character' issue dogging Mr Clinton. Each was intent on putting his best foot forward - and into President Bush. When not confronted with each other and dealing only in soundbites, the reticence is less apparent. And they were due to go at it again here last night.</p>

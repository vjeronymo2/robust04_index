			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / How To Spend It: A respected chair man - A workshop that concentrates on quality or indeed any other store, large or small, metropolitan or provincial. The only way to view the chairs, made in the Arts and Crafts tradition to the designs of Ernest Gimson, is to take a trip to Neal's workshop. There, on any weekday or Saturday morning, you will find him at work at the bench used by Gimson up to his death in 1919, creating perfect pieces of work using exactly the same methods he was taught when he started as a 14-year-old 52 years ago. The workshop is a downbeat affair, housed in a former shop in the all-brick village of Stockton in what was formerly the rural industrial belt of south Warwickshire, where the claylands used to sprout huge brickworks and the limestone underneath gave rise to the original Rugby Portland cement quarries. Inside however, Neville Neal's workshop is full of sweet smelling newly-cut ash in all the shapes and sizes needed for Neal and his 40-year-old son Lawrence to assemble into some 20 variants of hand-made Gimson-designed chairs and stools. On the walls, beside the frames of partly-completed chairs, hang many of the original tools. Edward Gardiner, who learned the craft of chairmaking from Gimson in the village of Sapperton near Cirencester, intended to continue the tradition when he moved his timber importing business to Warwickshire just before the First World War. After a break of six years or so he was persuaded to take up the craft again in 1920 and he continued making rush seated chairs in the village of Priors Marston, six miles from Stockton, until his death in 1958. Neville Neal became apprenticed to Gardiner when he left school in 1938 and took over the business on Gardiner's death. Followers of the Arts and Crafts tradition will be familiar with the story of how Gimson, originally an architect, and his collaborators, the Barnsley brothers, put their artistic theories, largely derived from Ruskin and Morris, into practice at Sapperton. They trained local men to turn out a range of exquisitely made furniture. It followed the Arts and Crafts ideals of being functional yet good to look at, but not so good that the owner would be afraid to use it daily, and not excessively expensive to buy. Ladderback and spindleback dining chairs made with the Neville Neal stamp are in a direct line of Arts and Crafts movement work that stretches right back to William Morris. They are all made in the spirit of Morris's belief that we should have in our houses nothing that we do not 'know to be useful or believe to be beautiful.' There is little chance of automating production in the Neal workshop because of the painstaking processes of working timber and rush. While Neville Neal is happy to make batches of up to 50 in the same style he is more at home with just four or six - or even one-offs, like the three-seater bench he made for an American artist last year. It was the first he had made (and might well be the last) and cost the customer Pounds 750. The Neal chairs come in eight main styles and cost from Pounds 106 to Pounds 122 each. Rockers and carvers cost more, and children's chairs and stools less. The waiting list is about nine months from the date of order. Neville Neal also works in oak. Chairs in this wood cost slightly more than the ash ones, neither are they as good, in his view. 'Oak is more brittle. If we get a chair back for repair it is more often than not an oak one. Ash is virtually unbreakable,' he said. It takes about five hours to make the rush seat of a chair. All the work is done by the Neals using rushes they have gathered themselves in the summer months from the banks of the Warwickshire Avon or the nearby river Leam. The rushes come free. 'No money passes hands between us and the landowner - just the occasional chair,' Lawrence said. Lawrence has been working with his father since leaving school in 1966 but, if his father, now 66, retires he will be happy to carry on the tradition, making chairs in the same place and in much the same way. 'It's not really possible to mechanise or update the production process very much, however much money one might have to spend,' Lawrence said. 'Our chairs are essentially hand-wrought individual items, and of course the quality has to be absolutely right.' Lawrence is hopeful that one of his two sons, aged three and 10, will become the third generation to carry on the tradition. Neville Neal, Stockton, near Rugby, Warwicks CV23 8JE.</p>

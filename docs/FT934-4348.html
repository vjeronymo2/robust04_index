			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / EU to recycle the issues at fresh talks on waste Germany, Denmark and the Netherlands were yesterday given a fresh chance to reach a compromise on new European Union rules for dealing with packaging waste or risk having their ambitious recycling goals voted down by their partners. Environment ministers of the 12 failed to reach agreement in 21 hours of negotiations. Now, a special council to resolve the issue has been called for December 13, and senior EU officials warned that the 'green' trio will be defeated under a weighted majority voting system if they cannot come to terms with the other nine. These nine take as their yardstick what they see as the failure of Germany's national recycling targets. These so exceed local reprocessing capacity that Germany is exporting huge quantities of used paper, board and plastic, with a subsidy, to be handled in other member states. Eight of Germany's partners complain their own efforts to build up recycling industries are being overwhelmed by this dumping. France has threatened an import ban, a possibility also raised by the UK House of Commons select committee on the environment. Because of the German programme's distortion of the single market, the Belgian presidency of the EU, allied with the European Commission, has lowered the recovery and recycling targets to levels Bonn and its allies consider regressive. But they are being offered the opportunity to stick to their more ambitious goals if they can prove they will not be distorting trans-European flows of waste for recycling. Meanwhile, ministers decided on new targets to reduce car emissions by 1996, and to speed up the phasing out of ozone layer-depleting HCFCs and methyl bromide, used for soil fumigation. Carbon monoxide emissions from new cars will have to fall a further 30 per cent in petrol engines and 68 per cent in diesel engines; hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxide emissions by 55 and 38 per cent respectively; and particle emissons from diesel engines by a further 55 per cent. Incentives will be allowed for those countries seeking to reach these targets before 1996. HCFCs do far less damage to the ozone layer than the chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) they are replacing in aerosols and refigerators but are now due for total phase-out by 2015. The UK is to ratify the Climate Change Convention, one of the key instruments from last year's Rio Earth Summit aimed at combating global warming, David Lascelles reports. Mr Tim Yeo, environment minister, said a programme to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide to 1990 levels by the year 2000 would be published early in the new year. This week's UK budget also included measures to combat gas emissions by increasing taxes on fuel consumption, and encouraging energy efficiency.</p>

			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / Sri Lankan Tamils leave India The first batch of over 600 Sri Lankans who fled to India to escape civil war in their country left for home yesterday heading for an uncertain future, Reuter reports from Madras. In Colombo, aid workers expressed concern over the fate of more than 30,000 who have volunteered to return home. They said that the conditions that had forced more than 200,000 Tamils to flee fighting between Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) guerrillas and government troops had not changed sufficiently to justify their return. India's southern Tamil Nadu state, which accommodated most of the Sri Lankan refugees, had put them under close surveillance after the May 21 assassination of Mr Rajiv Gandhi, the former prime minister, by a woman suicide bomber, a suspected LTTE activist.</p>

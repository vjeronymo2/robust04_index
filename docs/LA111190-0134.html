Howie Dougherty added a touchdown later in  the quarter.  </P> <P> The only bright moment for Oak Park came in the second quarter on a 24-yard  Mike Stern field goal.  </P> <P> Bishop Diego scored its final touchdown when Oak Park's Wes Lones fumbled the  second-half kickoff and Danny Kendrick recovered the ball at the Eagle 28.  Donati, 10 of 20 for 89 yards and one interception, then passed four yards for  his second touchdown. ROB SONNER  </P></p>

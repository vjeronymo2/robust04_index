			<p>940221 FT  21 FEB 94 / World Bond Markets: Frankfurt Last week's half-point cut in the discount rate took the markets by surprise but did nothing to satisfy bund market investors. There was disappointment that the cut to 5.25 per cent did not go hand in hand with a reduction in the all-important securities repurchase or 'repo' rate, which was fixed for this week at 6 per cent - where it has been for the past two months. It is difficult to see what can provide the impetus for a change in sentiment. Good data on January M3 - which may be published this week - will not change the fact that the easing move last week was less substantial than the markets wanted. Developments in the US government securities market will also be watched carefully: further anxiety about rate rises in North America is likely to spill over into the German market, where the average current yield was 5.78 per cent on Friday and the yield of many 10-year issues was back over the 6 per cent mark. There is a danger that the Bundesbank reduced the discount rate merely to put the proper margin between it and the repo rate. Mr Paul Brunker of Robert Fleming in London thinks the Bundesbank wants to see how the currency holds up in the wake of rate cuts. But, he warns, nerves will be stretched if there is no signal of further easing in the next two weeks.</p>

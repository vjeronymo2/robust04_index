			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] On 1 March International Atomic Energy Agency  [IAEA] experts are to begin the inspection of seven nuclear  facilities in the DPRK.    Kondratiyev, commentator of this broadcasting network, said  that the international community will undoubtedly welcome this.    He said: The people have waited for this news for a year.  Talks among IAEA, Washington, and Pyongyang representatives on  international inspection of nuclear facilities in North Korea  necessitated such a delay.    North Korea withdrew from the Nuclear Nonproliferation  Treaty  [NPT] in March 1993 and refused IAEA inspection of its nuclear  facilities. The negative results of such a decision by North  Korea should not be emphasized as many of them are being removed  with the beginning of the inspection.    The affirmative results of Pyongyang's agreement to  inspections are very clear. First, Washington and Seoul will  suspend the Team Spirit joint military exercise, which was held  every year. Second, talks for forming normal relations between  the United States and North Korea will continue. A third round  of talks will likely be held on 21 March.    What is the most important result is the resumption of  North-  South talks, because no one but the Korean people themselves can  solve the problems on the Korean peninsula, including the  denuclearization issue.    The North and the South of Korea had already reached an  agreement on denuclearization of the Korean peninsula in 1991.  The only thing remaining is the implementation of this plan.  The resumption of working-level talks between the North and the  South is scheduled on 3 March.    We cannot (?assess) at this moment the result of IAEA  inspections of DPRK nuclear facilities. The beginning of the  inspection, however, will exercise good influence on the Korean  peninsula and on the overall political situation in this area.</p>

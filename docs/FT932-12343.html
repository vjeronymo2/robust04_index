			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / Brussels to open telecom market by 1998 THE European Commission yesterday set a deadline of the beginning of 1998 for open competition in the Ecu100bn (Pounds 79bn) market for EC telecommunications services, and promised to put pressure on member states to liberalise domestic and international telephone calls. The Commission hopes to get agreement from member states on the principle of liberalisation, and the five-year timetable, before introducing draft legislation. EC telecoms ministers, some of whom are bound to oppose rapid liberalisation, will discuss the plan for the first time on May 10. Mr Martin Bangemann, EC industry commissioner, said yesterday: 'The transition period doesn't mean we are just going to sit back ineffectually until 1998; it means the process will end at the latest in 1998. Progress could be made more quickly than that.' The plan should eventually allow non-EC operators to offer rival services on EC networks. Mr Bangemann said yesterday access would only be granted if non-EC markets were also opened. The proposals go much further than the plan originally favoured by the Commission, to open only intra-EC calls to competition. However, Brussels has decided to continue discussions on the controversial question of setting up competing private telecoms networks, instead of encouraging the immediate use of existing cable TV and railway networks for telecoms services. France, Belgium and Germany are opposed to rapid liberalisation, while Britain, Denmark and the Netherlands favour a more aggressive effort to increase competition. One aim is to reduce discrepancies between the cost of local and international calls. Mr Bangemann and Mr Karel Van Miert, competition commissioner, stressed yesterday that liberalisation should not endanger a standard service for all subscribers or the financial stability of operators. British Telecom last night welcomed the Commission's call as 'excellent news', saying liberalisation would be 'in the best interests of everyone, particularly the consumer'.

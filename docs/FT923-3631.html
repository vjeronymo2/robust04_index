			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / 'Tax meter' unveiled to expose Italian dodgers THE Italian finance ministry claims to have perfected a device to catch tax-evaders. It is called a 'redditometro' - literally an income measurer - but more aptly it might be termed a 'taxmeter'. In essence a computer model of a person's income is drawn up on the basis of their possessions and the cost of their maintenance. This is then measured against that individual's declared income. If projected income exceeds more than 25 per cent of declared income, then the tax-payer will be called to explain. Against the back-drop of continuing large-scale tax evasion the authorities want to have a reliable means to check declared income against real earnings. The government has previously relied on an unsophisticated system of assessing 'real' income, backed up by casual checks from finance ministry inspectors. According to Mr Giovanni Goria, the finance minister who announced the new 'taxmeter' after Wednesday's cabinet meeting: 'The real novelty is not so much in the philosophy but in its application which can now be applied on a vast scale thanks to all the information technology available to the ministry.' Within a month of the proposal being approved by parliament, the tax authorities will start sending a questionnaire to people suspected of evading taxes asking for details about the size of the home and nature of ownership, possession of cars, motorcycles, yachts, helicopters and aeroplanes as well as household help. Each item is graded on a scale of one to 10 to form the model projection of the contributor. Interestingly, the only items to be graded the potential maximum 10 points are insurance policies and life insurance premiums - and indeed the latter if divulged provide an accurate indicator of wealth. Another indicator, telephones and telephone bills, are excluded. But already the finance ministry has threatened to check a taxpayers' electricity consumption to check the size of homes. Critics argue the 'taxmeter' blurs the distinction between checking wealth and income while the government maintains that in a country where there is chronic tax evasion the assessment of wealth must be used as a means to establish income. The authorities have carefully chosen to ask people to declare those items whose ownership can be easily checked in existing registers. Successive Italian governments, partly reflecting the authoritarian controls of Mussolini times, have established an ever growing jungle of bureaucracy surrounding the purchase of items like cars, the transfer of property or the supply of public services. Italians are asked to divulge a large number of intrusive details about themselves. However, until now the country's tax authorities appeared never to have co-ordinated such information. In theory, computers have made this possible. But equally the tax authorities' threat to be more intrusive could encourage the evaders to be even smarter, and in turn create even more bureaucracy.</p>

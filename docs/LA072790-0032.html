			<p><P> July 27, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: ARTS  </P> <P> Christie's Record Sales: Despite strong indications that the overheated art  market has encountered a big chill, Christie's overall sales have hit a new  high.  </P> <P> The London-based auction house's worldwide sales for the 1989-90 season  totalled $2.376 billion, a 40% increase over the previous year's total of $1.78  billion. Weak sales in some areas were outweighed by such record highs as the  $82.5-million sale of Vincent van Gogh's "Portrait of Dr. Gachet." Christie's  sold 247 works of art for more than $1 million apiece in 1989-90. Of those, 41  commanded more than $5 million apiece and 14 brought more than $10 million  each. BETH KLEID  </P></p>

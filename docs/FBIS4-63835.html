			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS parliamentary correspondent Lyudmila Yermakova] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 24 TASS -- Neither the State Duma nor  the Federation Council will impede the ratification of the  treaty between the Russian Federation and the Slovak Republic,  Federation Council Deputy Chairman Valerian Viktorov told a  parliamentary delegation from the Slovak Republic during their  meeting in the Russian parliament today.    According to Viktorov, the Russian Foreign Ministry has  already sent the document to the State Duma, the lower chamber  of the Russian federal legislature, for consideration.    Slovak delegation leader Ivan Laluga said members of the new  Slovak parliament, which has been functioning for a mere six  months, are interested primarily in the democratization process  in Russia and in principles of work of the Federation Council in  this respect. He said Slovakia is considering the establishment  of a second chamber in its parliament to better reflect the  interests of the regions".    The sides exchanged views on the activity of legislatures in  the two countries and expressed confidence that their inter-  parliamentary ties will continue to strengthen.    Responding to questions about relations between the Russian  Federation and the Chechen Republic, Viktorov stressed that "all  problems between the federal centre and the Chechen Republic  must be settled though negotiations". According to him, it is  far from best to try and solve such problems by force. He said  the Russian president's intention to meet with the president of  the Chechen Republic was a positive development.</p>

			<p><P> April 9, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> E. EUROPE ON RECORD FOR FREE ENTERPRISE SYSTEM  </P> <P> Moscow and its reformist allies, in a move unthinkable only months ago, have  accepted an international accord committing them to back private property, free  enterprise and multi-party democracy, delegates to an East-West economic  conference said today.  </P> <P> Although not legally binding, it represents a formal commitment by the  reformist Communist countries to step further down the path of Western-style  free markets and make their currencies convertible.  </P> <P> The pledges are contained in a draft final document agreed upon by 35 nations  attending a Conference on Economic Cooperation in Europe, which has been  meeting here since March.  </P> <P> The document, submitted by six neutral countries today, was based largely on  proposals from the European Community, Canada and the United States.  </P></p>

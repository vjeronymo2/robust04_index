			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / Business and the Environment: Putting brakes on the bus cartel - Leslie Crawford breathes the smog in Santiago / Urban air pollution SANTIAGO'S chronic smog obliterates its most stunning landmark. The towering Andes that once formed the backdrop to the Chilean capital now exist only in the memories of long-suffering residents and the postcards bought by tourists. Although Santiago has no heavy industry to speak of, and its population (4.5m) is only a fraction of Sao Paulo's or Mexico City's, it nevertheless rivals these heavyweights for the dubious distinction of being Latin America's most polluted city. The reasons for this lie in the capital's untrammelled growth and its dry climate, but above all in misguided free-market policies which encouraged the development of the most chaotic, inefficient and costly public transport system in Latin America. Chile's former military government lifted controls on bus transport from 1975 onwards until there were no restrictions on routes or fares. Anyone who owned a bus could drive it wherever they pleased. As a result, there are more than 14,000 buses trundling through Santiago. Most run half empty, spewing out diesel fumes and thick clouds of soot from their engines. Deregulation did not bring about a fall in fares. The lack of alternative transport allows Santiago's 4,000 bus owners to operate a cartel, which controls a Dollars 250m-a-year business and rigs prices to mask inefficiencies. But to grasp the full extent of Santiago's smog problems, one must add 430,000 other vehicles to Santiago's bus fleet, the dust from 700km of unpaved roads and wood burning in homes. The amount of particulate matter - dust, soot, and a choice blend of mutagenic agents - never falls below twice the accepted international health standards. In winter, when a mass of cold air traps the smog near ground level, the concentration of breathable particles can increase five-fold, forcing the closure of schools and industry. Drivers face restrictions of varying degrees for nine months of the year. Hospitals are overwhelmed by the number of patients with respiratory diseases as soon as the autumn sets in. Their waiting rooms overflow with children attached to vaporisers - a kind of oxygen mask that unblocks obstructed lungs. Pneumonia has become the main cause of infant mortality in Santiago. The military regime, which stepped down in March 1990, suppressed the results of medical research on the deteriorating health of its inhabitants. President Patricio Aylwin's government has made a brave stab at the problem since taking office less than two years ago. However, its greatest success so far has been political. After an acrimonious year-long conflict with the bus owners' cartel, the Ministry of Transport succeeded in forcing the retirement of the oldest 2,600 buses in circulation with compensation for their owners. It also put the city's bus routes to tender in an effort to rationalise services and ease traffic flow. This was at first boycotted by the cartel, but its members caved in. The new services, scheduled to begin next month, were awarded on a point system that gave top marks to operators offering newer buses and lower fares. 'Putting the bus routes out to tender has effectively broken the cartel because operators have had to compete on the basis of price and quality,' says Juan Escudero, a transport systems analyst at Santiago's Decontamination Commission. Santiago's police now have the power to carry out spot checks on vehicles belching out exhaust fumes - and order them off the streets. The government has forbidden the import of used motors and spare parts, and from September onwards all imported vehicles will have to come with catalytic converters. Some of the capital's 1,000 industries are already cleaning up their act, but the investment so far in reducing toxic emissions remains a paltry Dollars 18m. The impact of planned tougher legislation remains uncertain while the government lacks inspectors to enforce it. Escudero would prefer the onus to rest on self-regulation, and he is toying with the idea of a 'pollution bourse' where licences permitting specified amounts of contamination could be traded. This would force industries to factor their emissions as an economic cost. If the idea sounds strange, consider some of the other proposals seriously put forward: Blowing up mountains to the north and south of the capital to create an air vent. Rain-making machines. Fans to lift the smog. The proposals reflect, perhaps, how desperate Santiago's inhabitants are to improve their environment. When the first electric trolley-buses reappeared last month after 14 years, a trio of old ladies, alighting for the first time, knelt before the conductor and blessed the bus. Next week's article will focus on Tokyo.</p>

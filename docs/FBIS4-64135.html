			<p>BFN     [Text] Russian President Boris Yeltsin expressed extreme  concern over the criminalization of society. Speaking at the  All-Russian conference of the Federal Counter-Intelligence  Service [FCIS] in Moscow on Thursday, he pointed out that  "violent crimes by organized groups take the form of criminal  terrorism."    In Yeltsin's words, "the corruption of power structures,  law-enforcement and other state bodies especially in the sphere  of redistribution of property is extremely dangerous for the  state."    The Russian president noted that "organized crime is already  not confined to the sphere of regular crimes. It seeks to enter  big politics, to gain access to ruling the state and its  regions."    The FCIS should prevent such attempts with all of its  operational and technical potential, Yeltsin said. "In  interaction with the Interior Ministry and tax police it is  necessary to reveal criminal sources, the financing of political  campaigns, ties of state and political figures with organizers  of criminal gangs which seek to have their people in state  bodies, and are subsidized from abroad," he pointed out.    The president noted that Russia's nuclear safety is an  extremely important problem. "We should prevent proliferation of  nuclear and other arms of mass annihilation all over the country  and abroad," he noted.    Yeltsin believes that the counter-intelligence bodies should  be outside politics. As for its servicemen they cannot combine  their work with political activities, i.e. to serve the  interests of a party or a public organization.</p>

			<p>930802 FT  02 AUG 93 / Unions look beyond Labour for support with campaigns UNIONS ARE increasingly turning to cross-party political lobbying instead of depending on the eventual return of a Labour government, judging by the preliminary agenda for this year's Trades Union Congress to be held in Brighton next month. Although the campaign by several large TUC unions to retain their influence in the Labour party is bound to dominate the congress, few motions even mention the party. A motion from the CPSA Civil Service union specifically asks that a campaign to defend public services should 'seek the support of all parties represented in parliament'. In another motion the CPSA calls for joint action with the Confederation of British Industry. The largest number of motions, 11 in all, protest against the government's latest labour legislation. There is particular concern about some elements of the Trade Union Reform and Employment Rights Act 1993, including a late amendment that has the effect of giving employers the right to deny pay increases to staff who refuse to sign personal contracts. Mr John Monks, who will take over as TUC general secretary at the end of the congress when Mr Norman Willis retires, is expected to back this new campaigning tone. Mr Monks has already made clear that he wishes to influence all the main political parties and that he does not want 'too many eggs in one basket'. He will also, in a keynote speech, set out what sort of TUC he wishes to lead. Mr Monks takes over at a difficult time for the TUC, with membership lower than at any time since 1945. Mr Gavin Laird, general secretary of the AEEU engineering and electrical union, yesterday stressed the need to loosen ties with Labour. He noted that the US anti-union legislation of the Reagan-Bush Republican administrations is being reversed in spite of the lack of formal links between unions and the Democrats. The percentage of union members paying their dues by direct debit has nearly doubled from 4.8 per cent to 8 per cent since 1991, the Labour Research Department, the independent labour movement organisation, says. However the 'check-off' of dues by employers still remains the most popular method with 82 per cent paying this way.</p>

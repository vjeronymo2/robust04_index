			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / World Trade News: US targets EC products for retaliation MRS CARLA HILLS, the US trade representative, yesterday released a list of Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.08bn) worth of EC products potentially targeted for high import tariffs in retaliation for the loss of European market share by US soyabean producers. 'We have gone the extra mile, patiently pursuing this issue through the General Agreement for Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) for five years,' she said in an accompanying statement. 'However, in light of the magnitude of trade harm the US is suffering, I have no choice but to prepare a commensurate trade action.' The list - probably the largest ever compiled for a trade action - included: EC wines, cheeses, beers, meat products, seafood, breads, vegetables, gin, vermouth, brandy, whiskey, unmanufactured tobacco, animal feed, cut flowers, vegetables and cooking oils. The US trade representative will now hear public comment for at least 30 days before paring the list of targets from Dollars 2bn to Dollars 1bn and putting the sanctions in effect. Two dispute settlement panels in the Gatt have found the EC at fault for subsidies of its oilseeds sector. EC subsidy schemes have boosted domestic output of oilseeds by more than 10m tonnes since the early 1980s. The EC has said it plans to offer compensation to the US, as well as Argentina and Brazil, but the Bush administration is being urged by the farm lobby to accept no settlement that does not benefit the soyabean producers.</p>

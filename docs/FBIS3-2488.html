Reviewing the bilateral trade and cooperation, Li Peng said  that the bilateral trade is still at a comparatively low level  due to problems in transportation, trade form and areas of  cooperation.    "The two sides should make concerted efforts to expand areas  of cooperation and promote the development of economic  cooperation and trade," the Chinese premier said.    Aliyev appreciated China's successes in its economic reform  over the past decade, saying that it is wise to work out  principles and policies in light of the actual conditions and  characteristics.    Aliyev promised to further its cooperation with China in  every field.    Li Tieying, State Councillor and minister in charge of the  State Commission for Restructuring the Economy, called at Aliyev  at the state guesthouse here this afternoon and exchanged views  with him on economic reforms.    Aliyev spoke highly of tremendous achievements China has  made  in its reform and opening to the outside world. Azerbaijan is  ready to study China's successful experience in reform, he said.</p>

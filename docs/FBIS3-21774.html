			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos described  yesterday's decision by the EU [European Union] Commission not  to send Greece to the European Court for its measures against  Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] as  positive. In a statement made today, Venizelos said the EU  Commission's decision puts the weight on the political aspect of  the issue, something which the Greek Government has continuously  stressed.    Responding to a question about the revelation in a  television  program regarding heroin processing plants in Skopje, Venizelos  said that the Greek Government will examine the evidence that  was reported and bring it to the attention of the other Balkan  countries. He said that it is necessary to clarify the  situation and the responsible ministers have already been  informed and are working on the issue.</p>

Indonesia House has been established in an effort to  coordinate such an effort. It is a forum that acts as a  facilitator for Indonesian businessmen who wish to invest and  conduct business in Myanmar.    This was stated by Communications Minister Haryanto  Dhanutirto, after he, Coordinating Minister for Industry  Hartarto and Joop Ave, Minister of Tourism, Posts, and  Telecommunications presented their reports on their recent visit  to Myanmar to President Suharto at Merdeka Palace on 15 June. He  clarified that the Burmese officials reflected a positive  attitude regarding the interest shown by Indonesian businessmen  to conduct business activities in Myanmar. They gave priority to  such an issue.    According to the communications minister, Indonesia House is  headed by Hutomo Mandala Putra (known as Tommy Suharto). An  office has been set up in Myanmar as an effort to facilitate all  matters pertaining to investments in Myanmar.    The communications minister said, "Indonesia House is  getting  serious attention from the Government of Myanmar. This was  indicated through the authorities' appointment of its national  development planning board chief as the partner for Indonesia  House."    According to the communications minister, Indonesia House  coordinates several business groups, such as the business groups  on forest industry, industries, trade, design and construction  and tourism.    One of the most promising sectors of cooperation lies in the  forest industries because 53 percent of Myanmar is covered with  forests. Indonesia is currently a producer of plywood. The  country hopes that its markets will be perpetually secured and  safe as a result of the cooperation with Myanmar.    Apart from this, there is also bilateral trade cooperation  in  the cashew nut business. Indonesian traders are involved in  about 43 percent of the cashew nut trade. The country hopes to  capture a greater segment of the global trade through this  bilateral trade cooperation. [passage omitted]</p>

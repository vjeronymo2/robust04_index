			<p>940131 FT  31 JAN 94 / Seoul fails to cool share deals The Seoul bourse has surged to a four-year high, in spite of government efforts to cool the market. The general share index rose 2 per cent to 946 on Saturday, a day after the government announced new share issues would be increased to soak up liquidity and that financial institutions would be encouraged to sell stock. The government wants to curb stock speculation, fearing it could divert funds from the industrial investment needed to boost economic growth this year. The finance ministry said it would raise the amount of permitted new share issues this year by Won3,200bn to Won10,200bn (Pounds 8.4bn). This would include an initial share issue by Korea Exchange Bank and a new rights offering by the Commercial Bank of Korea. It also urged domestic institutional investors to sell Won3,000bn worth of shares. Funds are flooding into the exchange because of low interest rates depressing the bond market and recent government efforts to stamp out speculation in the property and unofficial loan markets. Korean companies are also expected to report higher earnings. The 7.8 per cent rise in the share index last week also reflected the inclusion on the Seoul exchange of Samsung Heavy Industries, a big shipbuilder.</p>

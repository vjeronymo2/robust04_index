			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Panamanian Education Minister Marcos Alarcon </F> by reporter Luis Alberto Jimenez at the Palace of the Herons in  Panama City on 14 April--recorded]    [Text] [Alarcon] We all were watching, let's say, what the  television stations were analyzing. Nothing at all was being  planned. We were simple viewers analyzing the various reactions  as reflected by the television interviews.    [Jimenez] Did the members of the Cabinet Council know of the  content of the document that was going to be presented?    [Alarcon] No Cabinet Council member knew about this  document.  This was a decision made solely by the president, and if you  listen to the documentary introduction the president himself  assumes the responsibility of the content of the document.    [Jimenez] Politically speaking, who gains from this?    [Alarcon] The people are the ones who benefit. The people  are the ones who did not know the inside details of how the  military government operated.</p>

			<p><P> September 13, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BARBARA BUSH TO HONOR LATINA OUTREACH GROUP  </P> <P> It must have been a strange sight to the Latinas arriving at a Santa Ana clinic  for a free gynecological examination: A rummage sale in the parking lot where  other women were selling old clothes and shoes to make money for their  fledgling organization.  </P> <P> That was eight years ago, when the county chapter of the Mexican American  Women's National Assn. needed money to continue sponsoring the free exams that  have been offered each spring since then. More than 300 needy Latinas, many of  whom had never had a Pap smear and most of whom did not speak English, have  been helped through the clinics.  </P> <P> "They have the ability to reach that person who would not usually get care,"  said Dr. David Lujan, an Orange physician who volunteered to work in this  year's clinic in April. "They are fulfilling a role here that is not served" by  the medical community.  </P> <P> Today, the county group will be honored by its parent organization in  Washington for sponsoring the clinics. Among those attending the awards  luncheon will be First Lady Barbara Bush.  </P> <P> "We really feel like we are coming of age," said Irene Martinez, president of  the county chapter of the group, which goes by the name MANA.  </P> <P> It is the only organization of Latinas in the county, where at least 155,000  Latinas live, Martinez said. The group's 110 members range from homemakers to  business executives, though most are professional women.  </P> <P> The free clinics were one of the first projects organized by MANA, which has  since developed programs to try to fight the skyrocketing high-school dropout  rate among Latinas and to encourage more Latinas to become leaders.  </P> <P> Next month, MANA will be holding its second annual leadership conference for  Latinas at the Southwest Senior Center in Santa Ana. The event will include  workshops in both English and Spanish on such subjects as cultural transition,  motivation and non-traditional careers. County Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez will  speak about the political empowerment of Latinos.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'To Share the Skills'  </P> <P> "One of the things we really want to get into," said Evelyn Colon-Becktell, a  MANA board member, "is to promote development and leadership in our women. We  want to share the skills we have gotten so that they don't have to start from  scratch like we did."  </P> <P> Another important issue for MANA is education, Martinez said. Nationally,  statistics indicate that about half of all Latinos drop out of high school.  </P> <P> Martinez said the dropout rate is even higher among Latinas, who are often kept  out of school to care for younger siblings or those who get pregnant as  teen-agers.  </P> <P> Last year, MANA began a mentor program called the Hermanitas Project (Spanish  for little sisters), in which 50 Santa Ana High School students were paired  with MANA members who are role models, counselors and friends. This year, the  program is expanding to 250 students from the Santa Ana district and will  include a youth leadership conference in November, field trips and awards.  </P> <P> "We hope," said Martha Gallegos, MANA's vice president and a census outreach  supervisor for Santa Ana, "they will turn to an organization like MANA when  they need assistance, whether it's a problem at school or with their home life.  We know what they're going through, and we're here to help them."  </P> <P> MANA also hopes to work with the families of these girls, because there is  often a reluctance in the Latino culture to allow young women to leave home for  college or a new job.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Helping to Educate Parents'  </P> <P> "You either let go of them when they get married or you don't let go at all,"  said Martinez, director of programs and marketing for Orange County Community  Consortium Inc. in Santa Ana. "These are the types of things that MANA can help  address by helping to educate parents."  </P> <P> But even when parents are persuaded to let their daughters go, it is often with  some hostility. In those cases, MANA members can confer with each other.  </P> <P> Gallegos said: "It's a real support group. (Latinas) come to the point where  they are breaking away from some traditions, and they sometimes don't get  support from their families. In MANA, you are among other women who are  accepting you as family and giving you that support."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 16 (KCNA) -- Stanley Faulkner,  vice-chairman of the International Liaison Committee for  Reunification and Peace in Korea (Cilreco), in a letter sent to  the president of the United Nations General Assembly recently  with regard to the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula, urged  the implementation of the resolution of the 30th session of the  UN General Assembly adopted in 1975, saying countries producing  nuclear weapons have been increasing tensions against North  Korea. Noting that, no matter in which country they may be,  nuclear weapons pose a threat to peace, the letter stressed they  are contrary to the mission of the United Nations.    It contended that the DPRK and the United States should sit  at the negotiating table and settle the nuclear issue of the  Korean peninsula through dialogue.</p>

			<p><P> June 29, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> RESTORATION FUNDS OKD FOR EAGLE ROCK LIBRARY  </P> <P> A joint committee of the state Senate and Assembly has agreed to earmark  $250,000 for the restoration of the former Eagle Rock Library.  </P> <P> Three similar allocations approved by legislators since 1981 have been vetoed  by Gov. George Deukmejian, and there are no guarantees that the allocation will  be approved this time.  </P> <P> The money to restore the 62-year-old building is part of the 1989-90 budget  fashioned by a six-member conference committee appointed by the two legislative  houses. Assemblyman Richard Polanco (D-Los Angeles), who represents the Eagle  Rock area, had asked the committee for $400,000 to restore the library.  </P> <P> The Spanish mission-style building has been vacant since 1981, when the library  moved to new quarters. The grant would enable Los Angeles to bring the former  library up to earthquake standards and to install access for the handicapped.  The city's General Services Department would provide matching funds of $26,500.  </P> <P> The budget is expected to be approved by the Senate and the Assembly this week.  Deukmejian, who has veto power over individual spending items in the budget,  must approve it by July 30.  </P></p>

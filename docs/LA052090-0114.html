			<p><P> May 20, 1990, Sunday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> LITHUANIA RULES OUT SUSPENSION OF SECESSION LAW  </P> <P> Lithuanians searched Saturday for concessions to offer Mikhail S. Gorbachev as  a way of opening talks with the Soviet leadership but ruled out suspending  their declaration of independence, which virtually ensures that crippling  Kremlin economic sanctions against them will continue.  </P> <P> Reporting to an emergency session of the Lithuanian parliament, Kazimiera  Prunskiene, the breakaway republic's prime minister, summed up talks she held  in Moscow with Gorbachev. Then deputies debated proposals they hope will bring  Soviet authorities to the bargaining table to end a two-month-old stalemate.  </P> <P> Though no formal vote was taken, lawmakers concurred that "there can be no  question" of suspending the independence declaration they approved March 11,  Arvidas Ryabchis, a spokesman in the Parliament's Information Bureau, said by  telephone from the Lithuanian capital of Vilnius.  </P> <P> The March 11 declaration set off the crisis with Moscow. Unless the Lithuanians  reverse themselves or there is a dramatic shift in the position of Gorbachev,  who has repeatedly said the proclamation is illegal under Soviet law, the war  of nerves over Lithuania's right to unilaterally proclaim its independence  seems certain to continue.  </P> <P> In a dispatch printed earlier on the front pages of Soviet newspapers, the  official Tass news agency said the bottom line of the Kremlin's position is  "the indispensable necessity that the Lithuanian Supreme Soviet (Parliament)  cancel -- or at a minimum, suspend -- this act (the independence declaration)  and all the legislative measures following it that contradict the Soviet  constitution."  </P> <P> In her remarks in Parliament, Prunskiene acknowledged that Gorbachev, who met  with her Thursday, was still pressing for suspension of the independence  declaration.  </P> <P> According to Edward Tuskenis, another Information Bureau spokesman, Prunskiene  said suspension would be too risky because it would juridically return  Lithuania to the status of a "Soviet socialist republic" that it had for 50  years after annexation by the Kremlin in 1940.  </P> <P> "What the deputies will do is review laws passed since March 11 and see which  can be suspended," Tuskenis said. Gorbachev has specifically objected to laws  establishing separate Lithuanian identity cards and annulling mandatory Soviet  military service, and to the alleged confiscation of Communist Party property.  </P> <P> The Lithuanian deputies adjourned Saturday night without making a formal  decision. They are to reconvene Monday to hear legal experts and reports from  economists on the damage done by the Soviet economic sanctions imposed in  April. The Parliament, officially called the Supreme Council, is to consider  several drafts of concessions it might offer the Soviet leadership, and  Prunskiene sounded optimistic that the proposals would win Moscow's agreement  for negotiations.  </P> <P> "To my mind, all possible effort has been made from our side," she told  state-run Soviet television. "This may be taken into account, and next week we  may move closer to further discussions on the entire complex of problems  related to the restoration of Lithuanian statehood by means of compromises and  a transitional period."  </P> <P> Secretary of State James A. Baker III, who met Friday with Prunskiene in the  Soviet capital, expressed support here for Lithuania's "hopes and aspirations  for independence" and again called for dialogue between the two sides.  </P> <P> Addressing a news conference, Baker denied a published report that he had  pressed the Lithuanians to suspend their independence declaration, saying,  "That is not for me to do." He also recalled that the United States has never  recognized the absorption of Lithuania and its two Baltic neighbors, Latvia and  Estonia, by the regime of Soviet dictator Josef Stalin.  </P> <P> "The exact course that they follow is up to them to determine -- and regardless  of what that course is, they are certain to have the support of the United  States of America, as they have had (in) the past," Baker said of the  Lithuanians.  </P> <P> Last month, Gorbachev imposed a cutoff in Soviet oil supplies to the republic  of 3.8 million people, as well as large-scale reductions in natural gas  deliveries, as a way to throttle the independence drive. Prunskiene said that  in their talks, Gorbachev threatened even tougher sanctions.  </P> <P> Saturday night, Soviet television reported that an oil-fired power station in  Lithuania now has only enough fuel for two more days of operations, and that  industries were warned that electricity could be switched off at any time.  Prunskiene has also said that half the Soviet rail shipments bound for her  republic are being sidetracked elsewhere in the country.  </P> <P> As deputies pondered what concessions to offer Moscow, pro-secession forces  rallied on what is now called Independence Square in Vilnius, waving the  republic's yellow-red-green flag.  </P></p>

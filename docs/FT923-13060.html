			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / Lord King hands over BA to Sir Colin Marshall LORD King handed over command of British Airways to his deputy Sir Colin Marshall yesterday after 11 years at the controls of the formerly state-owned airline. He will remain non-executive chairman for another year before becoming the company's first life president, an honorary position. Sir Colin will implement an economy drive aimed at cutting another Pounds 150m from the company's costs this year. He takes charge of one of the few airlines to have increased profits during 1991. Last year saw the first fall in the number of international airline passengers, and the world's airlines between them lost about Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 780m) last year, Lord King told the company's annual meeting in London yesterday. In a farewell speech punctuated by shareholder applause, Lord King said he had hoped 'to leave some small footprint in the sands of time. I have decided to reduce my executive role in the company from today,' he said. 'The single most important step I took was to find and recruit Colin Marshall. When I step down (as non-executive chairman) I shall propose that I shall be succeeded by Sir Colin.' There was some aggressive questioning from shareholders on the company's plans to amend its articles of association to take control of the level of foreign ownership of shares. That control has been in the hands of the government since the company was privatised in 1987. Responses included some characteristic banter between Lord King and Sir Colin on the stage of the Barbican arts complex in central London. Twice, Lord King referred shareholder inquiries from the floor to Sir Colin with the words 'good question'. The amendment to the articles of association was eventually passed, and the company now has full control over the level of acceptable foreign ownership in the company.

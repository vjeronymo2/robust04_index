			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Charges push Tiphook loss up sharply to Pounds 331m The share price of Tiphook, the debt-laden transport leasing company, rose by 10 per cent as fears of a rights issue diminished, but pre-tax losses for the year to April 30 jumped from Pounds 21.8m to Pounds 331.1m. The shares added 4p to 38p, as Tiphook reiterated the commitment of its bankers, which control the destiny of a company with gearing of 1,551 per cent. Net debt almost halved from Pounds 1.02bn to Pounds 512.5m during the year, following the sale of its container leasing company. However, shareholders' funds fell from Pounds 215.1m to Pounds 33.3m. The container sale continues to throw up some difficulties. Transamerica, the purchaser, is proposing a further cut of Pounds 11.4m, in addition to an initial Pounds 12m adjustment from the Pounds 734m purchase price. This has been fully provided for. However, Tiphook had originally estimated Pounds 31.8m of costs associated with the sale and financial restructuring, while the actual amount charged was Pounds 19.5m. The 1994 figures included exceptional items of Pounds 295.7m (Pounds 75.3m), and Pounds 75.9m (Pounds 72.1m) in interest charges. The sale of the container division resulted in a loss of Pounds 124.8m, while there was a further Pounds 168m taken under operating activities. The company has been reduced to two core divisions, Trailer Rental and Rail Wagon Rental, which both saw substantial profit declines during the year. To reflect its new composition a name change is planned to Central Transport Rental Group. Due to the earlier sale of 9,532 of its older trailers, the division achieved average utilisation of 74.1 per cent in 1994, compared with 56.6 per cent. However, on lower rental rates operating profits before central costs and exceptional items were Pounds 18.3m (Pounds 31.8m). The Rail Wagon operations' operating profits fell from Pounds 4.1m to Pounds 800,000. Mr Rupert Hambro, chairman, said: 'We are acutely aware of our very high level of borrowing. With our continuing drive for economies and cost reductions we have reasonable expectation of seeing margins improve.' Tiphook was also looking to 'take appropriate steps to improve our financial structure.' There is no dividend. Losses per share came to 301.1p (41.2p). COMMENT The key to Tiphook's survival has probably been the size of its difficulties. With more than Pounds 1bn of debt, Tiphook's bankers had a lot to lose. Nevertheless its future remains uncertain. Financial reconstruction is inevitable, meaning substantial dilution for shareholders. In addition, the company has to resolve problems such as a Pounds 156m obligation to purchase trailers in 1996, for which no funding is in place. An improving European economy could provide some joy, but at this stage the risks are far more striking than the rewards.</p>

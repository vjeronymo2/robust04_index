			<p><P> March 30, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> AREA NEWSSTANDS: WHERE TO GO TO FIND OUT WHAT'S UP  </P> <P> Nurturing a reading habit at area newsstands is easy -- most are at busy  intersections and along well-traveled corridors such as Ventura and Victory  boulevards. Many have boulevard addresses, but actually front on a cross  street, so look around the corner.  </P> <P> "Newsstands are definitely growing in number," said Errol Pectol, general  manager of ARA Services in Burbank, a major distributor of magazines and  paperbacks. "We've had several new, major stands open in the Valley in the past  several years, and none have died out."  </P> <P> Some newsstands carry daily foreign newspapers, such as Britain's Daily  Telegraph, France's Le Monde and Italy's Corriere Della Sera. The papers, flown  in daily, arrive one day late and cost from $2.50 to $2.95 for dailies and  $3.75 to $4.95 for Sunday editions.  </P> <P> Sunday editions of out-of-town newspapers, such as the San Jose Mercury News,  the San Francisco Examiner, the Denver Post and the Milwaukee Journal, are  mainstays at many stands, and some vendors also carry daily editions. All  arrive one day late. The newspapers are priced from $1 to $4 for dailies and  $2.50 to $4 for Sunday editions.  </P> <P> Area newsstands and hours of operation:  </P> <P> What's News, 21900 Ventura Blvd. at Don Pio Drive, Woodland Hills.

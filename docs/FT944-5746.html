			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / Philippine growth rate quickens The Philippines' gross national product rose by 5.9 per cent in the third quarter of the year on sharply higher farm output and accelerated growth in industrial activity, the government announced yesterday. The growth rate was the highest since the third quarter of 1990 and brought growth in the first three quarters to 5.5 per cent, compared to 2.2 per cent in the period last year, said the National Economic and Development Authority. Gross domestic product, which excludes capital inflows and remittances from Filipinos employed abroad, grew in the third quarter by 5.1 per cent, up from 2.7 per cent a year ago. The improved performance bolstered government hopes for full-year 1994 growth of up to 6 per cent, from last year's 2.3 per cent.</p>

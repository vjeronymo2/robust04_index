			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, Feb. 3 (YONHAP) -- South Korean Ambassador  to the United States Han Sung-su said on Thursday there is no  difference between Seoul and Washington's positions on the North  Korean nuclear problem. Han, who is attending the annual  conference of Korean ambassadors and envoys here, said the two  nations' relationship is strong enough to weather any attempt to  destroy it. He expected that the North Korean nuclear problem  will be discussed by the United Nations Security Council after  March 21.    If the Board of Governors' meeting of the International  Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), slated for March 21, comes to the  conclusion that the continuity of North Korea's nuclear  safeguards can no longer be assured, the issue will have to be  discussed by the U.N. Security Council, he said.    "Then, the council will discuss everything about the (North  Korean nuclear) problem including sanctions against North  Korea," he said.    He urged Pyongyang to make a rational judgement, saying that  the North Koreans themselves know very well that the issue will  be transferred to the U.N. Security Council if the IAEA Board  of Governors' meeting fails to solve the problem. He also  confirmed that there are no problems with South Korean security.  He denied U.S. reports that tension on the Korean peninsula is  mounting, saying that South Korea's security has not  deteriorated and is in fact no different from the past.    Meanwhile, discussions on deployment of U.S. Patriot  missiles in South Korea are under way between the South Korean  and U.S. Governments, and the two have agreed that deployment of  the anti-missile missiles should not affect the IAEA-North  Korean negotiations, Han said.    The reason why the IAEA and North Korea cannot narrow their  differences is not the possibility that Patriot missiles will be  deployed in South Korea, but that they differ on technical  problems related to nuclear inspections, he added.</p>

			<p><P> December 1, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MCENROE NOT READY TO SERVE CHANG;  </P> <P> MASTERS TENNIS: IT TAKES THREE SETS, BUT 30-YEAR-OLD VETERAN BEATS 17-YEAR-OLD  AGAIN TO ADVANCE TO SEMIFINALS.  </P> <P> The first time he played John McEnroe last year in Paris, Michael Chang said he  felt like the kid carrying McEnroe's rackets.  </P> <P> So on the occasion of their fourth meeting, it is perhaps noteworthy that the  would-be racket-carrier sees something of a change in roles coming right up.  </P> <P> "I'm hoping soon he'll be carrying mine," Chang said.  </P> <P> And for a few moments Thursday night at the $3-million Nabisco Masters in  Madison Square Garden, it appeared such a role reversal might be taking place  sooner than expected.  </P> <P> Chang, who was one point away from 0-5 in the third set, caused some very  anxious moments for McEnroe, but not enough of them. McEnroe prevailed, 6-2,  5-7, 6-4, in 2 hours 44 minutes to reach the semifinals.  </P> <P> Also in the semifinals is Ivan Lendl, who defeated Aaron Krickstein, 6-1, 6-3.  Lendl and McEnroe play tonight to decide the winner of their group and Boris  Becker and Stefan Edberg meet to settle the winner and runner-up of their  group.  </P> <P> The McEnroe-Lendl loser plays the Becker-Edberg winner in one semifinal and the  reverse makes up the second of Saturday's semifinals.  </P> <P> It took Lendl 20 minutes to win the first two games and seemingly about 30  seconds to close out the match against Krickstein, who is winless in their five  meetings.  </P> <P> "He's scary," Krickstein said. "I think he's the best player in the world -- at  least against me. Hopefully, he'll win Wimbledon and retire."  </P> <P> McEnroe, 30 years old and 13 years Chang's senior, may have aged a little bit  as he was forced to an extra set for the first time by Chang.  </P> <P> There were 18 break point opportunities that cropped up for Chang, who cashed  in just three of them, a rejection of opportunity that cost him the match.  </P> <P> However, Chang had his moments and even McEnroe had to admit that.  </P> <P> "It was a real dogfight," he said.  </P> <P> In their previous matches, one of the dogs was a pup. But after falling behind  two service breaks for 4-0 then 5-1 in the third set, Chang nearly evened the  match.  </P> <P> He eventually broke McEnroe in a momentous eighth game after McEnroe won an  argument with chair umpire Gerry Armstrong over McEnroe's favorite nemesis, the  electronic service line machine.  </P> <P> Trailing, 3-5, Chang won his service game to 4-5 and held two more break points  for 5-5, but he missed three more break point chances. Chang may have had  another at deuce, but he mistimed a short ball that had clipped the net cord  and banged the ball long with McEnroe hopelessly trapped at the net.  </P> <P> That lost opportunity troubled Chang. "It was just bad luck," he said.  </P> <P> McEnroe whipped a backhand volley winner crosscourt to give him a second try at  match point, which he cashed in with a forehand volley crosscourt.  </P> <P> His work done, McEnroe retired to the training room to get a rubdown. McEnroe  had barely avoided a letdown and he knew it.  </P> <P> "He's so low to the ground and gets to so many balls, he just attacks the  court," McEnroe said. "He's got incredible legs."  </P> <P> "If (Chang) is as strong mentally in five years as he is now, he should be very  happy," McEnroe said.  </P> <P> There was an example of Chang's mental process early.  </P> <P> "He won the coin toss and he thought about what to call for like 15 or 20  seconds," McEnroe said. "For him, I think it was some kind of intense thing."  </P> <P> McEnroe's reaction?  </P> <P> "I asked the chair umpire to penalize him for delay of game," McEnroe said.  "But Gerry said the guy has 30 seconds. They always have an answer."  </P> <P> McEnroe has always had an answer for Chang, too, but Chang said he will  persevere.  </P> <P> "At this point, he's still better than I am," Chang said. "But . . . hopefully,  it's just a matter of time."  </P></p>

			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (The Economy): City welcomes bond market liberalisation - Gilts repo plans The chancellor cheered UK government bond market participants yesterday when he unveiled plans to further liberalise the trading of gilt-edged securities. The announcement of the intention to establish an open market for gilt sale and repurchase agreements - 'repos' - was warmly welcomed, though widely expected. Changing the rules will bring the UK market more into line with practice in many other big government bond markets. It will scrap the requirement that stock can only be lent or borrowed through one of eight stock exchange money brokers. It will also abolish the rule restricting the borrowing of gilts to registered market makers and discount houses. Mr John Shepperd, chief economist at Yamaichi International, said: 'It is exactly what the market wanted to see - long-term, I think it will be beneficial for the gilt market.' The Bank of England said the steps 'should enhance the liquidity and efficiency of the gilt market, increase demand for gilts, and thereby reduce the overall interest cost over time to the government and the taxpayer'. However, the details of the proposed system have yet to be hammered out. The Bank of England said it hoped for an 'intensive period' of discussion over a consultative paper it issued yesterday. The Bank is seeking comments on the paper from market participants by January 31, 1995. It said that the new system could not possibly start before July 1995. Following a spate of highly publicised problems in the US repo market in the early 1980s, the bank decided at the time of Big Bang in 1986 that it was easier to supervise stock lending by insisting that brokers were used. In the paper yesterday, it said it was satisfied 'that the prudential problems initially experienced in repo markets in other countries can be addressed'. A repo is, essentially, a loan agreement between two parties in which bonds act as collateral. The institution which owns the bonds sells them to the counterparty and in return receives cash. At a set date in the future, the original bond owner agrees to buy back the bonds for a set sum. The buy-back sum will be higher than the original cash amount, the difference reflecting the rate of interest on the loan. In theory, both parties can gain from this transaction. The original bond owner raises money at a cheaper rate than by borrowing without using collateral. Meanwhile, the lender receives interest at a better rate than by just depositing the cash with a bank, and has the comfort of the bonds as security for the loan. However, there remain risks: Mellon Bank of the US announced this week a Dollars 130m charge to cover investment losses of customers after the fall in US bond prices this year. Government bond markets in other countries, including the US, France and Germany, already have well-developed repo facilities. But although London has long been the European centre of non-dollar repo business, the sterling sector has lagged behind its international competitors. In the consultative document, the Bank said the proposed changes would make it easier for a broader group of investors to 'short' gilts, without using futures or options markets. It said evidence did not support fears that the liberalisation would increase gilt market volatility. The proposed changes would also extend the sterling money markets, by in effect creating a new money market instrument. The chancellor said in the Budget that an open repo facility 'should improve both liquidity and efficiency, reducing yields and hence the government's debt interest costs . . . Each reduction in yields of one basis point will eventually save more than Pounds 25m a year of public expenditure.' The Bank said that changes to taxation arrangements 'might be required to facilitate the efficient functioning of a repo market.'</p>

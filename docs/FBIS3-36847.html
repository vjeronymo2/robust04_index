			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Valeriy Shanayev] </F>   [Text] Vladikavkaz, 9 Feb -- "North Ossetia is prepared to  move consistently toward establishing normal relations with all  its neighbors. Strong-arm methods should not be used on the  path toward peace, for force gives gives rise only to force."  These words were uttered by North Ossetian President Akhsarbek  Galazov, who today received a Russian parliamentary delegation  which is visiting the region. The delegation is headed by  Valeriy Fateyev, member of the upper chamber's security  committee.    During the meeting between the president and the  parliamentarians there was discussion of the problems of  regulating the situation in the state of emergency zone on the  territory of North Ossetia and Ingushetia. In the opinion of  Akhsarbek Galazov, "the problem of the return of refugees must  be solved in an integrated manner on the basis of the Kislovodsk  agreements. In this complicated question the coordinating  commissions which have been set up in all populated points of  Prigorodnyy Rayon have the deciding word."    Valeriy Fateyev told the ITAR-TASS correspondent that the  aim  of the parliamentarians' visit to North Ossetia and Ingushetia  is to gather objective information about the situation in the  conflict zone, to assess the situation in the region, and to try  to find a path toward peace and accord between the two  republics. They are to have meetings with the leadership of  Ingushetia, the interim administration, and various categories  of refugees, and will visit populated points of Prigorodnyy  Rayon. "The path toward peace and accord," Valeriy Fateyev  stressed, "is long and hard, but it must be sought. There must  be a stable situation in the northern Caucasus."</p>

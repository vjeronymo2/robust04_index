			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A third-party servicer entrusted with Title IV, HEA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program funds may not use those funds to compensate itself for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fees owed to the servicer by an institution. As provided in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;668.18, federal funds may only be used for Title IV, HEA program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purposes, and may not be hypothecated or used for collateral.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The only exception would be where an institution has agreed to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pay to the servicer all or part of the administrative cost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allowance payable to an institution under the Title IV, HEA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program regulations. Otherwise, the Secretary will regard any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effort to take servicing fees directly from federal funds as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> grave violation of a third-party servicer's fiduciary obligation,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for which its eligibility to contract with any institution should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be terminated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Several commenters believed that it is unreasonable to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expect a third-party servicer to be held to the same fiduciary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards as the institution.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Many commenters stated that the proposed language could be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> read to mean that if any employee of a third-party servicer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e.g., janitor or painter) has been convicted of or has pled  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> nolo  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contendere <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  to any crime involving government funds (not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specifically Federal student aid), the servicer is subject to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> termination. Four of these commenters voiced concern about the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issue of due process, because the ability to screen all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicants is very limited due to laws regarding privacy and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nondiscrimination in hiring. One of the commenters stated that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such removal may be prevented by State or Federal laws and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> perhaps expose the servicer to liability. One commenter believed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the provisions should be effective only for new contracts,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because many servicers currently have contracts with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subcontractors that do not contain the restriction regarding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> removal of an affiliation, and the servicer could be liable for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> breach of contract.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Secretary does not agree with the comment that a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> third-party servicer should not be held to the same fiduciary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard as an institution. As an agent of an institution, a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> third-party servicer administers aspects of the institution's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participation in the Title IV, HEA programs. Therefore, it is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary to hold a third-party servicer to the same level of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fiduciary responsibility as the institution in handling or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> influencing the use of Title IV, HEA program funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary agrees with those commenters who argued that a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> third-party servicer should not be considered to have violated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its fiduciary duty with regard to the conduct of any person,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> entity, or officer or employee of an entity with which the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> servicer contracts, if that person or entity does not have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Title IV-related responsibilities. For example, the Secretary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would not hold the conduct of a custodian employed by a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> third-party servicer as an element in determining that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> third-party servicer has violated its fiduciary duty, if that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> custodian had no responsibility for administering a Title IV, HEA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to those commenters who were concerned that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> removal of an agent of a third-party may violate due process or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may be prohibited by Federal or State law or may be a breach of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contract, the Secretary does not believe that those prohibitions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exist. However, the Secretary recommends that third-party  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> servicers modify their contract terms to specify that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> servicer is prohibited from engaging any entity to administer any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aspect of the Title IV, HEA programs that meets the criteria in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paragraph (d)(1)(i)(D) of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary expects a third-party servicer to apply these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisions to existing contracts as well as to any new contracts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the servicer may enter. These provisions supersede  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisions of existing contracts that the servicer may have with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> outside entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Paragraph (d)(1)(i)(D) of this section is revised so  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that a third-party servicer violates its fiduciary duty in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instances where the servicer uses or contracts with, in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> capacity that involves the administration of any aspect of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Title IV, HEA programs, any other person, agency, or organization  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that has been or whose officers or employees have been convicted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of, or pled  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> nolo contendere <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  or guilty to, a crime involving the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> acquisition, use, or expenditure of Federal, State, or local  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> government funds, or has been administratively or judicially  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determined to have committed fraud or other material violation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> law with respect to those funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter suggested that paragraph (d)(1)(i)(B) of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this section should be amended to exclude those instances in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which the funds that were fraudulently or criminally obtained or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> spent were repaid. The same commenter believed that this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provision is too broad in scope, and should be restricted only to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> crime and fraud involving funds covered by the contract between  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the institution and the servicer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Secretary disagrees with the commenter. A  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> person that has been convicted of, pled guilty to, or has been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determined to have engaged in criminal misconduct or fraud with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> respect to government funds poses a danger to the Title IV, HEA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs and the funds appropriated for use by those programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Such a person has violated the public trust by misusing public  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> funds. The Secretary does not believe that payment of restitution  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by that person is sufficient to guarantee that the person will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not repeat the offense.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Several commenters thought that the requirements in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paragraph (d)(2) of this section were unreasonable by specifying  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that an institution or third-party servicer would violate its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fiduciary responsibility if the servicer or a principal or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> affiliate of the servicer violated any Title IV, HEA program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement. The commenters thought that the cure_to sever all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ties with that servicer, or a principle or affiliate of that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> servicer, or to remove all responsibilities of administration of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Title IV, HEA programs_was too punitive in its scope. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

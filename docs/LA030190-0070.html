			<p><P> March 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PASADENA BOARD TO ASK FOR PAY OF $935 A MONTH  </P> <P> Members of the Board of Directors decided Tuesday to ask voters to raise their  pay to $935 a month.  </P> <P> The board unanimously approved placing the proposal for the pay hike on the  June 5 ballot, but in the belief that voters might reject larger amounts,  cautiously chose to peg it at $935. The amount is equivalent in 1990 dollars to  the $250 monthly pay set in 1968, according to calculations by city staff  members.  </P> <P> The ballot proposition will also ask voters to tie city director salaries to  the consumer price index so that raises will be automatically increased as the  cost of living rises. If approved by the voters, the increase would take effect  July 1.  </P> <P> "I don't view this as a pay raise for me," said Director Rick Cole. "I'm really  concerned about the citizens." Because board members receive $50 per meeting to  a maximum of $250 monthly, residents must choose among candidates who are  "retired, wealthy or overworked," he said.  </P> <P> The proposed raise was supported by Pasadena Citizens for Representative  Government. Attorney Dale Gronemeier, a member of that group, suggested an even  larger raise, to $3,000 per month, an amount the board perceived as  unacceptable to voters.  </P> <P> "To talk in terms of $3,000 would be a distinct uphill climb to be acceptable,"  said Mayor William Thomson.  </P> <P> Barbara Lamb, a resident who opposes the aerial spraying of malathion, also  spoke in favor of the raise. She said the board's actions last week -- when it  passed an ordinance banning low-altitude flights above the city and sent a city  police helicopter into the air to enforce it -- have boosted the board's  popularity, which could result in easy passage of the pay measure.  </P> <P> Increases in board pay were unsuccessfully proposed in 1988 after nearly three  years of review by a city-appointed Charter Study Committee. But that proposed  increase, to $1,200 a month, was tied to creation of an at-large elected mayor  with a salary twice that of the other board members. The mayor now is elected  from among the seven board members.  </P> <P> To simplify the current ballot proposal and ensure its success, the board  members avoided tying the pay hike to any other proposal, such as one  suggestion, rejected Tuesday, to increase the mayor's salary by 50%.  </P> <P> Although Thomson acknowledged that hours for the mayor's job are longer than  those of the other board members, he said a proposal to increase the salary  would be perceived as the first step toward creation of a strong-mayor form of  government, an idea rejected by the voters in 1988.  </P></p>

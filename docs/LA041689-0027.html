			<p><P> April 16, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TAXES  </P> <P> As I write my check to the IRS, I'm reflecting on the bills it will pay to keep  our country going. I feel good about contributing to education, housing, health  care, and saving the environment. But that just adds up to 14 cents of my tax  dollar. My hair stands straight on end when I think about 52 cents of that  dollar going into military budgets. Wouldn't we, in the end, be a stronger and  better nation if we could turn those figures around?  </P> <P> JUNE BEHRENS  </P> <P> Rancho Palos Verdes  </P></p>

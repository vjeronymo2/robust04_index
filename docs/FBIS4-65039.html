			<p>BFN     [Text] Turkey would like to coordinate the operation to  save the Karkuk-Yumurtalik oil pipeline with the UN guidelines.  Foreign Ministry spokesman Ferhat Ataman commented on the  subject when asked about certain proposals submitted in a letter  by the U.S. ambassador to Ankara regarding plans to save the oil  pipeline.    Ataman recalled that various contacts were held with the  Iraqi authorities and the coalition partners of the Gulf War  with the aim of rescuing the Karkuk-Yumurtalik pipeline.  Stressing that everyone agrees that it is necessary to save  this important pipeline, Ataman described this as a positive  development. We see that all the sides have begun exerting  efforts to this end, Ataman remarked, adding: During a visit to  our ministry yesterday, the U.S. ambassador confirmed that his  government also concedes this necessity. At this stage, he did  not make any proposals on the subject or submit any letters.  The permanent members of the UN Security Council have actually  begun exchanging views on the subject. We will continue our  consultations in London, Moscow, Paris, and Washington in the  coming days.    Ataman declared that from the beginning, Turkey's aim  remains  rescuing the Karkuk-Yumurtalik oil pipeline in harmony with the  UN system.</p>

			<p>920530 FT  30 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Park Food advances 73% to Pounds 6.9m as hamper sales grow OLD-FASHIONED virtues such as thrift might be spurned as Dickensian in some companies, but not at Park Food Group, where the only Victorian notion is that Christmas is still a time for good cheer and loaded tables, financed by weekly savings towards Park's main product, the annual hamper. Yesterday Park Food reported a 73 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 6.89m (Pounds 3.99m) for the year to March 31 1992. This was from static turnover of Pounds 119.5m (Pounds 119.6m). Mr Peter Johnson, chairman and managing director, said he was 'delighted' with the results and that potential for growth in the group's core business  -supplying Christmas hampers via a nationwide network of 65,000 commission-earning agents - was considerable. Mr Richard Hughes, director responsible for the hamper and voucher division, said that of the UK's 22m households, roughly half fit socio-economic C2/D/E profiles, the central target for the group's hampers. At the moment Park Food services some 1.5m of those homes, taking about 40 per cent of the Christmas hamper market, currently worth Pounds 300m annually. Sales of hampers for Christmas 1991 increased by 14.7 per cent over 1990's figure. Mr Johnson said that Park Food's hamper business had seen sustained growth since its establishment in 1967: 'when times are bad people feel the need to save and when times are good they feel they can save'. The group made a number of disposals last year, though the remaining subsidiaries - Jetlag, supplier of travellers' kits to airlines and hotels, and Bee Cee Foods, the group buying arm - are contributing to group profitability. Earnings per share increased by 79 per cent to 8.6p (4.8p). The directors recommended a final dividend of 2.2p (1.14p) making a 3.2p (1.6p) total. The group had nil gearing at March 31, compared with 60 per cent in 1991, and net cash of Pounds 10.9m. There was Pounds 13m cash flow from operations against Pounds 6.73m last time.</p>

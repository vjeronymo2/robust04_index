			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / FT Review of Business Books (19): No solution perfect - Corporate Governance / Geoffrey Owen looks at contrasting systems Capital Markets and Corporate Governance Edited by Nicholas Dimsdale and Martha Prevezer Oxford University Press, Pounds 40 349 pages The objectives of any system of corporate governance are to organise relationships between owners, boards of directors and management in a way which promotes the long-term growth and profitability of the enterprise. The form which these relationships take varies widely among the industrial countries and none has found a perfect solution. Most of the 16 papers edited by Nicholas Dimsdale and Martha Prevezer deal with deficiencies in British arrangements, including the allegedly malign effects of excessive takeover activity and 'short-termism.' But the book also contains some useful comparisons with Japan and Germany, which have problems of their own. Differences between the three countries - in the composition of boards, in the pattern of share ownership, in the role of banks - stem from historical circumstances. In Japan, for example, the capital liberalisation which began in 1967 promoted companies to protect themselves against foreign takeover through cross-shareholdings. With more than half their company's equity in the hands of stable, long-term shareholders, Japanese managers worry much less about the share price than their counterparts in the US and Britain. As Colin Mayer points out, Japanese and German systems of ownership and control are not directed exclusively to the interests of shareholders, but involve other stakeholders in decision-making, including suppliers, purchasers, banks and employees. In Japan, according to Seiichi Masuyama, 'stable shareholders are selected by and are dependent on management, and cannot therefore play a disciplinary role on corporate management'. The main source of disciplinary pressure, he suggests, comes from the need to satisfy employees. Jenny Corbett notes that Japanese boards are dominated by executive directors who are promoted from within: 'It is not clear how shareholders can remove or replace poor managers nor how they can force managers to look after their interests.' In principle, the monitoring problem should be handled more efficiently in Germany, where there is a clear separation between management and supervision. But supervisory boards meet only three or four times a year and their members are often too remote from the company's affairs to exert effective influence; their input, according to a survey reported by Jeremy Edwards and Klaus Fischer, is far less than that of US non-executive directors, partly because of the importance in the US of board committees, especially the audit committee. Recent failures of German corporate governance have raised doubts about the 'insider' approach to corporate control; there have been calls for the appointment of genuinely independent directors, with no business ties to the company. How these independent directors should be appointed, and what incentives they might have for rigorous monitoring of management, is one of the unsolved problems of the Anglo-American system. For Allen Sykes the way forward is for institutional shareholders to agree among themselves that every major company would have three to five 'core' investors, which would hold the shares for at least five years and be directly represented on the board. Their combined shareholding would normally amount to 15-20 per cent of the equity. Each of the top 60 institutions would take a special interest in, on average, eight of the top 100 companies. They would be free to trade without restriction in the other 92. Any move in this direction would require an unlikely degree of common purpose on the part of shareholders. British and American institutional investors have been intervening more vigorously in badly managed companies. But this hardly amounts to large, committed shareholdings on the Japanese or German pattern. How much do these differences in corporate governance matter? Many commentators deplore the absence of trust and commitment in the Anglo-American system. But the regeneration of the US motor industry over the past decade suggests that some Japanese management practices, including high-trust relationships with suppliers and employees, can be adopted within the constraints of US financial markets. German and Japanese institutional arrangements have some important strengths, but dispersed shareholdings and an active takeover market may not be quite as serious a competitive disadvantage as most contributors to this volume assume.</p>

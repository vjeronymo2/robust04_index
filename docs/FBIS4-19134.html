			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Heidemarie Wieczorek-Zeul, European policy </F> spokeswoman of the Social Democratic Party of Germany: "Beyond  Maastricht"]    [Text] The European Union (EU) is getting bigger. The  latest decisions have made it clear that the 12 states that  concluded a treaty in Maastricht can be accompanied on their  path toward further European cooperation by Austria, Sweden,  Finland, and Norway. What remains is to work to have the people  of these four states seize this opportunity courageously.    The history of European integration has been a story of  success up to now, the luster of which seems to be visible only  to those outside. Peace, cooperation across borders, and  prosperity for most people are part of this success story. It  continues: The accession of the Scandinavian states and Austria  strengthens those who have long been working for the realization  of a social union and an environmental union. A country like  Austria, for instance, strengthens those in the EU who are of  the opinion that European traffic policy must finally take the  interests of nature and the environment into account. This also  benefits the people in Germany. We, too, do not want endless  streams of traffic rolling along German highways in the growing  single market.    With the accession of these four former EFTA [European Free  Trade Association] states, however, the bell also tolls the hour  of truth for the governments of the member states themselves.  The question is: What kind of Europe do we want? A Europe  that is based on the principle of mere national cooperation  between its governments and on a free trade zone? Or a Europe  that can shape economic, social, ecological, and political  matters, that is, one that wants to be more than the sum of its  member states? In view of the globalization of problems and the  internationalization of developments, the answer seems quite  clear to me.    All the more surprised one must be about those voices in the  German discussions that, following the pattern of  national-conservative thinking, call European integration into  question as no longer necessary after the realization of German  unification. Such a position, however, grossly contradicts --  quite in contrast to its public justification -- Germany's  interests. It is bad that such positions are meanwhile also  being advocated by parts of one government party in Germany, and  that against its better knowledge, just to preserve its  political power. This means the danger of a radicalizing  nationalism that shifts toward the right and entails dangers  just like those that arose after the first German unification  120 years ago.    Loosening Germany's European integration would mean the  formation of new "alliances" and thus new isolation. Economic  prosperity, too, requires European integration. The economic  benefits of an integrated Europe are hardly questioned any  longer now. The preservation of European competitiveness in the  triad and the possibilities of a common research and development  policy, the necessary economic policy coordination, and  initiatives for growth and stability in Europe will not work  without an EU that is capable of action.    More integration is also necessary to facilitate a social  dimension in Europe. The conditions of the single market may  lead to serious deregulations and social dumping if common  minimum standards are not ensured. So far, Great Britain has  been blocking potential progress in this field -- a comfortable  state of affairs, since in this way none of the other 11 member  states is forced to state its sociopolitical intentions clearly.    Chernobyl has shown that environmental pollution does not  stop at borders. Therefore, setting down ecological standards  must not remain a national matter; after all, common survival is  at stake.    Freedom and democracy, a rule-of-law state, the protection  of  minorities, economic development, and social justice are the  bases for the preservation of internal and external peace  throughout Europe. Today the observation of human rights, basic  freedoms, democracy, and the principles of a rule-of-law state  is no longer exclusively part of a state's internal affairs but  are affairs that concern all the CSCE member states. The EU is  currently leading this process through political integration.    In economic and ecological terms a national state is no  longer sovereign, anyway. Europe's citizens have high  expectations for the EU and justified expectations regarding the  EU's benefits for their personal concerns. An EU that is not  transparent and removed from the citizens and could not  legitimize its actions in the eyes of its 350 million citizens  cannot be successful.    The EU needs reform to the head and the limbs, if it is not  to become incapable of action. Not only is it necessary to  strengthen further the European Parliament's rights to  participate in decisionmaking, but also to adhere strictly to  the principle of subsidiarity. Most problems can be solved more  appropriately at the local, laender, or national level. The EU  must become more transparent and democratic.    The desirable strengthening of the political role of the EU,  the European Commission, and its more effective control by the  European Parliament, the necessary majority decisions in the  Council of Ministers on all issues of European legislation can  probably be achieved only if future conferences for  restructuring the contractual bases of the EU also have national  parliaments and the European Parliament participating.  Therefore, it would be a fatal mistake if the conference, which  is to review the Maastricht Treaties in 1996, were to be  prepared once again in the old way of "secret government  conferences." Rather, it should provide the opportunity to hold  a large-scale public debate in our country in 1995 about the  further development of Europe. Any new contractual shaping of  the EU must be made subject to a vote by the people in Germany  and in the other EU member states.    The idea of democracy comes from Europe. The EU is to become  a model of democracy, transparency, participation, and  responsibility. The alternative would be: a failed hope and --  violence, because disintegration produces violence, as we see  every day.</p>

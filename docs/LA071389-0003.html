			<p><P> July 13, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ONLY IN L.A. / PEOPLE AND EVENTS  </P> <P> In a poll of seniors published by the student newspaper at Banning High in  Wilmington, the winner of "Best School Activity" for the year, was . . .  </P> <P> The teachers' strike.  </P> <P> Finishing second to the two-week labor dispute in the poll was a much shorter  event -- Senior Ditch Day.  </P> <P> The tension was thick on KPWR-FM radio the other morning when Dodger manager  Tommy Lasorda launched into a discussion on disc jockey Jay Thomas' show of how  he'd lost 36 pounds on the Ultra-Slim Fast diet.  </P> <P> Like an umpire, Thomas had to cut off Lasorda with the explanation that his  station sponsors the Nutri-Systems diet.  </P> <P> It was a moment that was nearly as awkward as when All-Star game announcer  Ronald Reagan remarked that Anaheim Stadium, home of the California Angels, is  "the greatest baseball stadium in America." After a few moments of silence, Vin  Scully, the long-time Dodger announcer, diplomatically resumed calling  play-by-play of the All-Star action.  </P> <P> Zsa Zsa Gabor, star of matrimony, talk shows and salons, appeared at the  Beverly Hills courthouse Wednesday morning with Husband No. 8 to plead innocent  to a misdemeanor charge of slapping a police officer.  </P> <P> Gabor, whose Rolls-Royce had been pulled over because her license tags were  allegedly expired, repeated her contention that the officer used "abusive  language and excessive force."  </P> <P> A former Miss Hungary of 1936 -- evidently she was around 13 when she won the  crown because she lists her current age as 66 -- denied that she was seeking  publicity.  </P> <P> "My dear boy," she told one reporter, "I don't need any help."  </P> <P> In an exclusive interview with The Times beforehand, Gabor's attorney, William  T. Graysen, said: "Make sure you spell my name right. G-r-a-y-s-e-n."  </P> <P> It just hasn't been Harold Ezell's week.  </P> <P> Not only was he was forced out as western regional commissioner of the INS, but  while he was conducting an interview with KABC radio's Michael Jackson on his  car phone, he disappeared from the air. "Suddenly you could hear some other  driver's conversation," reports Barbara Rosenstein of West Los Angeles, who was  listening to the show. "Michael Jackson sounded like he was trying to keep from  laughing."  </P> <P> Then, on the KNBC-TV (Channel 4) news, while anchorwoman Colleen Williams was  reporting Ezell's ouster, the picture on the screen showed the Air Force's  stealth bomber.  </P> <P> Even his critics would never have accused the talkative Ezell of being  stealthy.  </P> <P> A male shopper, apparently struck by a memory lapse, brought his cart to a halt  in the cleaning-goods section of a Ralphs market in West Los Angeles.  </P> <P> No problem. He took his cellular phone out of the cart, dialed home and was  overheard asking:  </P> <P> "Now which liquid detergent was I supposed to get?"  </P></p>

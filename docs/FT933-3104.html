			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / International Company News: Politics of money dominates Kuala Lumpur - Kieran Cooke on accusations that business deals are used to further Malay interests Earlier this year, the Kuala Lumpur stock market was set ablaze by a sudden surge in the shares of Union Paper Holdings, a small Malaysian company producing toilet paper and joss sticks. This stratospheric rise to MDollars 23 from MDollars 1.73 was triggered by rumours that Union was about to be taken over by a co-operative linked to the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), the political party which has dominated Malaysia's government since independence in 1957. But the takeover soon proved to be an illusion, and Union's shares dropped to earth. They were subsequently suspended, and many shareholders lost heavily. The Union fiasco highlights the influence of politics - and in particular of UMNO - on Malaysia's corporate community. 'Union Paper is only one example of the way many investors here make decisions solely on political grounds,' said one Kuala Lumpur broker. 'Company fundamentals are often ignored. The trouble is that the local speculators are often proved right: political connections, mainly to leading figures in UMNO, are a vital element in a large number of business deals.' At around USDollars 105bn, the capitalisation of the Malaysian stock market is bigger than Taiwan, South Korea and Singapore. Analysts point out that funds from abroad, encouraged by Malaysia's economic growth, have been flooding into Malaysian stocks recently. Yet often outsiders are ignorant of local political considerations. UMNO's corporate power and influence grew in tandem with a government programme called the New Economic Policy (NEP), which was inaugurated in the early 1970s. At that time the Chinese, who make up about 35 per cent of the population, controlled most economic activities in the country. The NEP was designed to give 'bumiputras', or indigenous Malays, who account for about 50 per cent of the population, a greater share in the country's wealth. They were favoured in government jobs, in education and in business. UMNO, the party of the Malays which has traditionally controlled all senior government posts, used its political clout to further Malay business interests. In the process, UMNO itself became directly involved in the corporate sector. By the mid-1980s, UMNO controlled a complex web of businesses which stretched into most areas of the economy. Through the Fleet Group, UMNO's investment holding company, the party owned the New Straits Times Group, the country's leading newspaper and publishing group. In 1988, United Engineers Malaysia (UEM), another UMNO company, was awarded what was then Malaysia's biggest infrastructure project - the MDollars 3.4bn (Dollars 1.34bn) contract for the privatisation of a highway running the length of peninsular Malaysia. More recently, UEM won a multi-million dollar contract to build a new link between Malaysia and Singapore. Party assets were transferred to trustees following a split within UMNO in 1988. Since that time, the party's extensive business shareholdings have been dispersed among various groups and business people, most of them seen to be closely connected with the UMNO Baru party, or new Umno, led by Dr Mahathir Mohamad, Malaysia's prime minister. The Renong group, a listed holding company which now controls one of Malaysia's biggest conglomerates, was the main vehicle for the transfer of UMNO corporate assets. Mr Daim Zainuddin, a former finance minister and now UMNO treasurer, is adamant that since 1988, UMNO has had no business interests. 'I categorically state and place on record that UMNO is not involved in any business,' said Mr Daim earlier this year. 'It does not own any company, nor shares in any company.' Mr Terence Gomez, a Malaysian academic who has made an extensive study of UMNO's corporate investments, says that while it might be correct to say that UMNO no longer has direct control of companies, the connections are still there. 'Umno patronage has led to the formation of very powerful business conglomerates,' says Mr Gomez. 'Now a stage has been reached when a business elite, made up of bumiputras and their Chinese partners, and with close connections to leading politicians, is able to dominate a large segment of corporate life. It can also seriously influence stock market behaviour.' The topic of 'money politics' has hit the headlines in Malaysia recently as different factions within UMNO line up for battle. Mr Anwar Ibrahim, the present finance minister, is challenging the position of Mr Ghafar Babar, the UMNO number two, in party elections due in early November. Whoever wins the race is seen as the likely successor to Dr Mahathir as UMNO president, and next in line to be prime minister. Opponents accuse Mr Ghafar of plundering state bodies for campaign funds, while Mr Anwar is said to have raised a substantial election war chest from the corporate sector. Mr Anwar is generally believed to have assisted the recent rise to prominence of Malaysian Resources Corp. MRCB, with little experience in the power sector, has become the lead partner in a project to build, own and operate a MDollars 3.5bn power plant. The company also played a key role in a MDollars 800m management buyout of the New Straits Times group and the country's only independent TV station from Renong earlier this year. Mr Anwar denies he was suspicious of the Renong management's political sympathies. But it is clear the media group, under its new management, has swung solidly behind the finance minister. Some analysts have become a little uneasy about developments. They say a substantial amount of corporate engineering has been going on, with little apparent benefit to minority shareholders. Managers of large foreign funds have begun asking questions about their investments in Malaysia's privatised entities, particularly Tenaga Nasional, the electricity utility, and Telekom, the telecommunications service. They say there is evidence of growing political interference in the operations of these companies, which undermines the privatisation process and could jeopardise long-term prospects. 'There are some noteworthy companies here who get on with business,' said one Kuala Lumpur broker. 'But for others, political connections are all-important. The system is so entrenched - it's part of the business culture.'</p>

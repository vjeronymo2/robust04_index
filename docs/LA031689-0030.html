			<p><P> March 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JACK SMITH: IN HAWAII, HOW GREEN IS HIS VALLEY  </P> <P> In Honolulu the lush Nuuanu Valley rises through a pass in the dark green  mountains to a precipice called the pali. It is a place where people often stop  and park their cars to peer from a viewpoint above the stupendous cliff out  over the velvet green coastal plain below.  </P> <P> Our friend Harry Albright drove us up through the valley through vegetation so  green and thick it made us forget for a moment the concrete excrescence that  Waikiki had become. From the pali we could see the rugged windward shore of the  island, and the town of Kaneohe. It was still relatively small and low in  profile.  </P> <P> For nearly two years one of my jobs on the night desk of the Advertiser had  been to call the local police departments in Kaneohe and other outposts on the  island to ask if there was any news. The routine never varied:  </P> <P> "This is the Advertiser. Any news tonight?"  </P> <P> "No. No news tonight."  </P> <P> The only time they ever had any news was on Dec. 7, 1941, and that night I  never bothered to call. We had enough news.  </P> <P> My wife remembered standing at the pali one day when the eminent pianist Artur  Rubinstein walked up and stood beside her. He was playing that night in  Honolulu and she went to hear him. Culture is where you find it.  </P> <P> The pali is famous in Hawaiian legend. King Kamehameha, who brought all the  Hawaiian Islands under his crown, is said to have driven the locals to the pali  and pushed them over, as commemorated in the popular song (as I remember it):  </P> <P> King Kamehameha, conqueror of the Islands,  </P> <P> Became a famous hero one day.  </P> <P> He conquered the native army,  </P> <P> And pushed them over the pali  </P> <P> And crowned himself  </P> <P> the king of Hawaii Nei.  </P> <P> We drove back down through Waikiki and around Diamond Head and up into its  crater, a shallow bowl that has become a park. The old gun emplacements could  still be seen around its crest. It was supposed to make Oahu impregnable, but  on Dec. 7 it was helpless against the attack by air.  </P> <P> That evening we dined with three shipmates in the Orchids Room of the  Halekulani, one of the three remaining hotels of the prewar era. It had been a  charming retreat, a low central building surrounded by cottages. Now the  cottages were gone, of course, replaced by concrete towers, but the hotel  itself looked reminiscent of the original, though modernized.  </P> <P> Before dining we had a drink on the terrace overlooking Waikiki Beach. Towering  palm trees were lighted dramatically. A trio of Hawaiian musicians sang the old  favorites, among them "Farewell My Tane."  </P> <P> My chest tightened. I had learned that song as a scullion on the S.S. Monterey.  At night after our watch the chief scullion, a pure Hawaiian, would get out his  ukulele and sing Hawaiian songs. My favorite of all he sang was "Farewell My  Tane."  </P> <P> I used to lie on my bunk in the ship's glory hole (that part of the forecastle  where the lower forms of marine life lived) and wonder if I would ever meet my  Tane, and whether our relationship would be that poignant.  </P> <P>  Farewell my Tane, child of a coral sea  </P> <P> We dreamed of heaven, now you've forgotten me  </P> <P> As it turned out, I never met my Tane. I married a haole girl, and we are still  together.  </P> <P> In the morning the hostess at our hotel's restaurant asked whether we wanted  the American or the Japanese buffet. "What's in the Japanese?" I asked naively.  "Rice, raw fish . . . ,"she began. "American," I interrupted.  </P> <P> I know the war is over. I am even willing to concede that in some respects the  Japanese won. But my acceptance of things Japanese does not extend to raw fish.  </P> <P> We flew home in a plane so crowded that my wife and I, having changed from a  later flight, couldn't sit together. Oh well, we had survived longer  separations.  </P> <P> I ordered white wine with lunch and the flight attendant brought me a small  can. The weather was rough, and when I opened it, I discovered from the spots  on my necktie and my pants, alas, that it was red.  </P> <P> But who could complain? At least the door didn't blow out in flight.  </P></p>

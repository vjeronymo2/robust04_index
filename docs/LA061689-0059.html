			<p><P> June 16, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Swedish prosecutors in the case of slain Prime Minister Olof Palme suffered  another setback when a third government witness backed off from earlier  statements implicating defendant Christer Pettersson, 42. Prosecution witness  Harri Sandberg-Miekkalina said police misunderstood a pretrial statement he  made about Pettersson in which he told them Pettersson hated Palme. "It was I  who hated Olof Palme, not Pettersson," he said, adding police induced him to  incriminate Pettersson by suggesting he would get part of a $7.5-million  reward. Later witnesses gave contradictory testimony regarding Pettersson's  whereabouts on the day of Palme's slaying.  </P></p>

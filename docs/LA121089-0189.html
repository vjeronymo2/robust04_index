			<p><P> December 10, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REPORT PREDICTS WORLDWIDE WATER SHORTAGES IN 1990S  </P> <P> A collision between increasing populations and wasteful irrigation practices  will produce shortages of water and food in some of the world's most populous  countries during the 1990s, the Worldwatch Institute warned in a report  released Saturday.  </P> <P> Although the situation in the United States is less dire, the inexorable growth  of Western states and their increasing demands on limited water resources will  force more of the nation's richest croplands out of production, the institute  reported.  </P> <P> The earliest and most dramatic impact of worldwide pressure on water supplies  may be felt in Egypt, according to the institute, a nonprofit research  organization that studies world environmental and economic problems.  </P> <P> It noted that virtually all productive land in Egypt is irrigated, the  population is growing at a rate of a million people every eight months, and the  country is the last in line to draw water from the Nile River.  </P> <P> The outlook for China, India, Mexico, Israel and Jordan is somewhat less stark,  but nevertheless foreboding, the institute reported.  </P> <P> At least 10 countries in North and East Africa "are likely to experience severe  water stress by 2000," the report states. "Egypt, already near its limits,  could lose vital supplies from the Nile as upper basin countries develop the  river's headwaters."  </P> <P> In much of the Third World, food security is destined to replace military  security as the most pressing priority of many nations, Worldwatch Director  Lester R. Brown said at a press conference.  </P> <P> The institute's study was headed by Sandra Postel, a Worldwatch vice president  and senior researcher who attributed looming shortages to short-sighted  policies, technical obsolescence and rising costs, in addition to the pressure  of growing populations.  </P> <P> In China, Postel said, the water tables beneath Beijing are dropping as much as  2 meters per year, and farmers in the arid region of the country may lose 30%  to 40% of their irrigation water to critical municipal and industrial demands.  </P> <P> In India, thousands of villages already face shortages, and large sections of  metropolitan New Delhi have water for only a few hours a day, while around  Mexico City, land is subsiding because of ground-water depletion.  </P> <P> In Israel, Jordan and the West Bank, where streams, aquifers and all other  water supplies that are renewed by rainfall will be in use by 1995, "shortages  are imminent," Postel said.  </P> <P> On a per-capita basis, the amount of irrigated land has been declining  worldwide since 1978, and in some countries, such as Mexico, there have been  outright reductions in the total area under irrigation.  </P> <P> Although many countries, such as China and India, rely on irrigation for more  than half of their food production, lending for irrigation by the major  international donors has declined sharply over the last decade, Worldwatch  reported.  </P> <P> Lending to 23 countries in Asia, North Africa and the Middle East by the World  Bank, the Asian Development Bank, the U.S. Agency for International Development  and the Japanese Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund fell more than 60% after  adjusting for inflation between 1977 and 1987, the report said.  </P> <P> The cost of bringing new land under irrigation is soaring -- reaching as much  as $4,000 per acre in Mexico -- and more than half of the world's irrigation  systems are in need of upgrading to remain in good working order, the group  said.  </P> <P> Although the United States will not experience the potential catastrophe facing  much of the Third World, the report found trends in the United States moving in  the same direction and policies hardly more efficient than those where critical  shortages loom.  </P> <P> Rapidly expanding Western cities, facing future water deficits, are  increasingly buying up perpetual water rights in a practice known as "water  ranching." In Pima County, Ariz., around Tucson, irrigated agriculture is  expected to disappear by the year 2020, the institute reported.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, some 4 million hectares -- about 10 million acres -- of U.S.  agricultural land is being irrigated at unsustainable rates "and will  eventually come out of irrigated production" unless farmers reduce pumping to  no more than the rate at which rainfall recharges aquifers, Postel said.  </P> <P> Water subsidies by the Interior Department's Bureau of Reclamation have  subsidized farmers who grow hay and pasture while more valuable water  priorities go wanting. And the artificially low cost of water used to irrigate  croplands such as California's San Joaquin Valley causes inefficient use of  scarce water resources.  </P> <P> "Farmers benefiting from the huge Central Valley Project in California have  repaid only 5% of the project's costs over the last 40 years -- $50 million out  of $931 million," Postel said. "This free ride in large part explains why so  few Western farmers invest in efficiency improvements."  </P> <P> The institute report was completed before the Interior Department's decision  Nov. 29 to renew 28 Central Valley water contracts for another 40 years. The  contracts provide for a 300% increase in the price paid by valley farmers for  irrigation water while ensuring that they will continue to receive ample  supplies well into the next century.  </P> <P> The 28 contract renewals were regarded as a harbinger of Bush Administration  policy on hundreds of contracts due to expire over the next several years.  Although some contract terms could be modified in response to findings of an  environmental impact statement, the amount of water allocated to agricultural  interests will not be reduced.  </P> <P> Among significant water policy initiatives around the world, Postel cited the  conservation initiatives of Southern California's Metropolitan Water District  as an example worthy of wide emulation.  </P> <P> By financing conservation projects in the Imperial Irrigation District, the  Metropolitan Water District is getting enough water for 800,000 Southern  Californians without the need for taking cropland out of production or selling  irrigation water rights.  </P> <P> Postel said that approach is "at the other extreme" from the strategy in  Arizona, where water ranching by cities has already destined thousands of acres  of prime agricultural land to revert to desert.  </P></p>

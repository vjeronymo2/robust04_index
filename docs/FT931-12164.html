			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / Survey of Personal Equity Plans (21): Best choice if you haven't a portfolio - Unit and Investment Trusts / Savings schemes currently seem to be one of the investment world's best-kept secrets. Charges are usually no greater than for buying in a lump sum UNIT AND investment trust Peps seem to be the face of the future. Now that the full Pounds 6,000 Pep limit can be invested in unit or investment trusts, sales have taken off. The Unit Trust Association's figures for net unit trust Pep sales show a startling rise in support for the products once the limit was raised. Sales in the second quarter of this year totalled Pounds 336m, compared with only Pounds 166m in the equivalent quarter of 1991. This was even higher than the Pounds 216m taken in the end-of-tax-year rush in the first quarter of this year. In the three months to the end of September, when almost all the news seemed to be bad for equities, net sales of unit trust Peps were Pounds 319m, compared with only Pounds 144m for the previous year. Plainly the public thinks these Peps are a good idea. Figures for investment trusts are more difficult to come by, because it is harder to keep track of the ownership of individual investment trust shares. However, several management companies have reported significantly increased sales, and the success of the newly launched trusts at the end of the 1991-92 tax year indicated the pent-up demand. M&amp;G's Income and Recovery trusts raised Pounds 376m between them. With the tax-free annual limits now equal for collective funds and directly held equities, it is difficult to justify the use of any other vehicle by those who do not have large portfolios of directly held shares. There are several reasons for this: Peps are now being marketed as a mainstream savings vehicle, but Pounds 6,000 is not a large enough equity portfolio to guard against the risk of capital loss. Collective trusts allow you to diversify your risk. The charges within the trusts allow the portfolio to be actively managed at no extra cost to the investor, while minimum dealing commissions eat into any active portfolio management in a direct-equity Pep. Information on past performance is much easier to come by if the underlying investment vehicle is a unit or investment trust, which can be monitored. Comparison of different managed Peps with any certainty has proved difficult, but comparison of unit and investment trusts is easy. A limited price war started this year between the different groups, as they have realised that the only way they could sell new products was through Peps. A quirk in pricing, which allows unit trust groups to be more innovative in pricing Peps than in pricing their basic product, has helped the process. And another argument in favour of unit trust Peps is simply that, if you were going to buy a unit trust anyway, and it costs no more to do so through a Pep, then you may as well take advantage of the tax benefits, even if they will not have a great immediate effect. Finally, collective trusts make it much easier to invest in savings schemes through regular savings rather than in a lump sum. If the Pep is to be used to fund a mortgage, when the typical buyer will already have spent a four-figure sum in other fees, investment via a lump sum is impractical. Pep savings schemes currently seem to be one of the investment world's best-kept secrets. Charges are usually no greater than for buying in one lump sum, even though the expenses of administration are greater. According to Roz Barder, of Chase De Vere's Pepguide, there are now about 65 separate unit trust Pep savings schemes to choose from, and about 23 schemes for investment trusts. There are also about 10 savings schemes which allow regular savings into Peps that buy a mix of shares and unit trusts, and six which allow this for mixtures of investment trusts and other shares. The minimum monthly investment tends to be slightly greater than for un-Pepped savings schemes, but still allows for very parsimonious saving. According to Ms Barder, the average monthly minimum for unit trusts is Pounds 50, while for investment trusts it is Pounds 100. These are not too high to deter those who are saving to back mortgages or school fees. A plan by the Inland Revenue to oblige regular savers to re-apply for their Pep each year now appears to have been watered down. According to the UTA, the current suggestion is that Pep providers make clear on their form that the commitment should be either open-ended or for one year only; and investors must make a choice from this 'dual track' option. Managers will also need to remind savers annually that they are allowed no more than one Pounds 6,000 Pep each year. The Pounds 1,500 limit on annual investments in funds that are 50 per cent or more invested in non-European markets remains a fly in the ointment for the sector. While the limit for investing in Peps as a whole was doubled, the restriction on international funds was left unchanged. This affects some of the longest-established and largest investment trusts, such as Foreign &amp; Colonial and Bankers. This led F&amp;C to launch a special Pep investment trust (Pepit) in October, which was mainly invested in FT-SE stocks. Investment and unit trusts are also covered on pages 27 and 28 of the Review</p>

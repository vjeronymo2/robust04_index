"In my opinion, neither side came to  Nairobi (Kenya) prepared to take the difficult steps necessary for peace," said  former President Jimmy Carter, who acted as an unofficial mediator in the five  days of talks. Both Carter and the Sudan People's Liberation Army said the  talks failed, but the government said they were merely postponed.  </P></p>

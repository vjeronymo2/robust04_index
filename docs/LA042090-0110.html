			<p><P> April 20, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> BREWERS' 11 RUNS GIVE THEM 42 IN FOUR GAMES  </P> <P> The Milwaukee Brewers are continuing their habit of taking batting practice  once the game begins.  </P> <P> Thursday night at Arlington, Tex., the Brewers beat the Texas Rangers, 11-0,  giving them 42 runs in their last four games.  </P> <P> On Wednesday, the Brewers defeated the Rangers, 11-6. At Fenway Park on Monday,  Milwaukee routed Boston, 18-0.  </P> <P> The offensive output Thursday made it easy for Chris Bosio, who pitched a  four-hitter for the American League's first complete game of 1990.  </P> <P> Bosio, who led the Brewers with 15 victories last season, struck out five and  walked one.  </P> <P> "This was the first decent weather we've had this year," Bosio said. "I got a  good sweat going and was loose."  </P> <P> Greg Vaughn and B.J. Surhoff each homered off Bobby Witt (0-2).  </P> <P> Bosio (1-0) retired the first nine batters before Gary Pettis and Rafael  Palmeiro singled in the fourth.  </P> <P> Oakland 5, Seattle 2 -- Dave Stewart kept his April winning streak going,  allowing five hits and one run in seven innings at Oakland for his 17th  consecutive victory in the opening month of the season.  </P> <P> Stewart, who lost his first 11 decisions in April, is 3-0 with a 1.86  earned-run average this season and 13-0 against Seattle since joining Oakland  in 1987. He has won 17 of 18 April starts since an April 15, 1987 loss to  Minnesota, and the A's won his only no-decision, 5-4 over Toronto on April 24,  1989.  </P> <P> Baltimore 4, Detroit 2 -- Oriole fans, anxious to cheer a team that went from  the cellar to second place in the American League East last season, finally got  their chance as the Orioles took advantage of eight walks in their first game  at Baltimore.  </P> <P> The Orioles were supposed to open at Memorial Stadium on April 2, but the  owners' lockout changed the schedule and sent them on an eight-game trip.  </P> <P> Dave Johnson (2-0) scattered seven hits over six innings to earn the victory.  Gregg Olson pitched the ninth inning to earn his fourth save and extend his  club record of 25 scoreless appearances, the most since Warren Brusstar of the  1983 Cubs put together 25 consecutive scoreless outings.  </P> <P> Cleveland 1, New York Yankees 0 -- Left-hander Greg Swindell (1-1) pitched 6  1/3 scoreless innings, allowing three hits, striking out five and walking one  at Cleveland as the Indians won their twice-delayed home opener.  </P> <P> The Indians had gone scoreless for 21 innings until Tom Brookens tripled with  one out in the sixth and, with Candy Maldonado at the plate, scored on a passed  ball by catcher Rick Cerone.  </P></p>

			<p>920729 FT  29 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow rises on Chrysler results and lower yields Wall Street IN SPITE OF more bad economic news, US equities posted their second best performance of the year yesterday in the wake of a sharp decline in long-term bond yields and strong second quarter earnings from Chrysler, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 51.87 up at 3,334.07, the best one-day gain since January 14 and the second largest of the year. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 advanced 5.98 to 417.52, while the American SE composite put on 2.49 to 384.55 and the Nasdaq composite appreciated 6.90 to 571.63. Turnover on the New York SE was fairly heavy at 218m shares, while rises outpaced declines by more than three-to-one. Stability on foreign markets set the tone for a solid start to trading, but the buying did not really gather momentum until mid-morning when bond yields plummeted on news of a fall in the Conference Board's latest index of consumer confidence. Although the confidence figures were bad in economic terms, equity investors were cheered by one of the biggest one-day falls in long-term interest rates this year - a decline that should stimulate activity in the housing market over the coming months. Technical factors also came into play when the Dow burst above the 3,300 mark, which has been a short-term ceiling for the average recently. After that, computer program buying then kicked in, pushing prices even higher and luring back to the market those investors who have stayed on the sidelines during the recent losses. Better than expected second quarter earnings from Chrysler also lifted sentiment. The stock climbed Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 21 3/4 in turnover of 6.1m shares in response to net income of Dollars 178m, a substantial turnround from the Dollars 212m loss incurred at the same stage a year ago. The two other big car manufacturing issues rose sharply on the Chrysler news: General Motors moved ahead Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 41 3/8 and Ford Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 45 3/4 , both in active trading. Telmex, the Mexican telephone monopoly, jumped Dollars 3 1/4 to Dollars 46 1/4 in turnover of 3.7m shares after revealing pleasing first-half results. Tenneco added Dollars 2 1/4 at Dollars 39 1/4 in heavy trading after the oil group announced second quarter net income from continuing operations of 71 cents a share, a reversal of the loss of a year ago. The Nasdaq market was led higher by hi-tech blue chips such as Apple, up Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 46 1/2 . Everex Systems fell Dollars  15/16 to Dollars 2 1/4 after warning that it would make a loss in its fiscal fourth quarter because of soft sales and weakening margins in the price-competitive personal computer industry. Canada TORONTO posted a modest gain in continued moderate trading. The TSE 300 index finished 15.1 firmer at 3,411.5 and advances held a slim 256-to-237 lead over falls after volume of 23.1m shares valued at CDollars 258.1m.</p>

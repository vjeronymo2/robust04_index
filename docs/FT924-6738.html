			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / Exams league table fiercely attacked: A north-south divide appears in rankings which have been published for the first time PUBLICATION by the gov-ernment of this year's GCSE and A-level examination results for schools in England caused fierce controversy yesterday. Mr John Patten, education secretary, hailed the exercise - involving the issue of 3m booklets - as central to the Citizen's Charter, enabling parents to make informed choices about schools for their children. Opposition parties, teachers' unions and an array of educationalists denounced the results tables as seriously misleading because they presented 'raw' results, making no allowance for socio-economic factors. The booklets detailing results achieved by all state schools and about a quarter of private schools will be distributed under the Parent's Charter, at a cost of Pounds 1.4m. Separate booklets for each of England's 108 local authority areas will be available through schools, libraries and from telephone request lines. Ranked by GCSE performance, London boroughs come top and bottom. After the Scilly Isles, with its one secondary school, are the London boroughs of Harrow and Kingston. Tower Hamlets, Barking and Southwark, all of which have large areas of deprivation, come bottom. Mr Philip Hygate, chief executive of Isles of Scilly council, said the isles position at the top of the table was not an aberration. 'It demonstrates the importance that education has on the Isles of Scilly. It is a historical and cultural issue.' The Isles of Scilly had compulsory education 30 years before the rest of the country. 'Almost 100 per cent of our pupils go on to A-levels or further education,' said Mr Hygate. Mr Patten said the tables 'mark the start of an information revolution, bringing an end to a system which has too often denied parents the right to know how schools are performing'. The National Confederation of Parent Teacher Associations condemned the tables as 'lies, damned lies and school exam statistics'. Mrs Ann Taylor, shadow education secretary, said: 'No parents should set too much store by raw results which cannot reflect the real achievements of schools - unless viewed with caution tables could unfairly damage the reputation of a school.' Mr Nigel de Gruchy, general secretary of the 179,000-strong National Association of Schoolmasters and Union of Women Teachers, said the tables 'do nothing more than confirm the obvious'. He said: 'Children in the gin-and-tonic belt of the south-east do better than those from the poorer areas of the country.' The tables are only the first instalment. Next year all primary schools and their results in the national tests for seven-year-olds will be included. Results from all independent schools will also be included, as will information on national curriculum test results for 14-year-olds, truancy rates and school-leaver destinations. LEAs and the independent sector complained yesterday at the way the tables were compiled.</p>

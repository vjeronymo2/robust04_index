			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / US health bill must cover all - Clinton President Bill Clinton yesterday challenged Congress by saying it must pass a health reform bill that covers all Americans - as his plan does  - instead of a watered-down version, AP reports from Washington. 'We should not walk away from this Congress without a commitment to cover everyone,' Mr Clinton said in an interview on NBC television. The president spoke a day after Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, chairman of the Senate finance committee, said there was no way that Congress would pass a bill guaranteeing healthcare for all Americans. Mr Moynihan said it was more likely that Congress would enact a scaled-down plan with the potential of insurance for everyone within 10 years. 'It doesn't have to be done tomorrow,' Mr Clinton said. 'It ought to be phased in over a period of just a few years, but we ought not to walk away without a bill that provides health care to all Americans.' Mr Clinton has made solving the healthcare crisis a top priority. More than 37m Americans have no health insurance, and Americans must spend a larger amount of their income on medical expenses than residents of most developed countries. Some measures in Congress envisage insuring 91 per cent of Americans. Ms Donna Shalala, health and human services secretary, has released a report showing 17.2 per cent of Americans were uninsured in 1992, up from 12.5 per cent in 1980. Most uninsured are middle class people, she said, hard-working Americans 'who get up and go to work every day, yet, every day they must live without the security of health insurance.'</p>

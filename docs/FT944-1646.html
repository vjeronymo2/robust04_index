			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / Equity Markets: News round-up - Tokyo In a week shortened by a national holiday on Friday to mark the birthday of Emperor Akihito, the market is awaiting today's announcement of the government's economic growth target for the fiscal year to March 31 1996, writes Robert Patton. And at the same time, Mr Yasuo Matsushita, who was installed as governor of the Bank of Japan on Saturday, will hold his first news conference. Some analysts note that given his background, there is some speculation that Mr Matsushita may be more inclined to assist the financial system than his predecessor. Tomorrow, the Ministry of Finance will present a draft budget for other ministries and agencies for the next fiscal year.</p>

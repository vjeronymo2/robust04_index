			<p>930805 FT  05 AUG 93 / A monument to Hosokawa's initiative: Gordon Cramb on the record of Japan's new PM who had a liking for modernist projects THE ARISTOCRAT who helped break Japan's 38-year-old political mould and is due to be elected today as prime minister has never held a cabinet post. For eight years, though, Mr Morihiro Hosokawa ran one small part of the country  -where he became known in equal measure as marketing man, internationalist, and builder of modernist municipal monuments. He described his job, as governor of the southern Kumamoto prefecture until 1990, as that of the region's top salesman. He brought in Dentsu, the country's biggest advertising agency, to promote a 'cultural infrastructure' which included the erection of dozens of design-conscious public buildings. 'On the surface he was successful but it cost a lot of public money,' says Mr Hatsuo Yamashita, branch general secretary of the Social Democratic party, which is one of the seven partners in the coalition which Mr Hosokawa will head. 'Visually Kumamoto has been changed but in the way it functions nothing much is different.' Kumamoto North police station is one striking example of the sort of building Mr Hosokawa has promoted. An inverted wedge of glass which cost Y2.5bn (Pounds 15.8m), it formed part of Mr Hosokawa's so-called Artpolis construction programme aimed at promoting quality of life in Kumamoto and its image nationally and abroad. It was completed as Mr Hosokawa's term ended. The shape of the police station provides a symbol of what local political foes and colleagues from the period agree was a 'top-down' administrative style, strong on initiative and short on consultation. Mr Hosokawa is credited in Kumamoto with bringing the relatively poor prefecture to national attention through projects such as the Artpolis, as well as the Technopolis research and development centre for which he raised more than Y2bn from local donations. He also brought in an agricultural programme to encourage communities to become more specialised in what they grow. His popularity was always high, with an approval rating towards the end of his term put by one local opinion poll at more than 70 per cent. In part this reflects the traditionalist populace of the region, many of whom revere Mr Hosokawa, whose family ruled there for more than two centuries until 1868. Some called him (tono-sama (lord). His increases in construction spending, however, dented the share of the budget going to social security and to education. Although these grew in yen terms as the budget expanded in the prosperous 1980s, opponents point out that the outlay on education, in which he professes a special interest, shrank from 27.5 per cent of all spending to 24 per cent during his time in office. Yet the Artpolis projects provided high-quality public housing estates, and the 30 per cent of the budget allocated to construction was not out of line compared with other prefectures. However, some projects appear to be an eccentric indulgence typical of the high spending years in late-1980s Japan  -an outdoor theatre with one of the largest stages in the country goes unused most of the year because of the region's high rainfall. Mr Arata Yamauchi, Mr Hosokawa's budget director for Mr Hosokawa's first four years in office and deputy governor during his second term, says: 'He saw the historic buildings in Kyoto and Nara (two former capitals of Japan) and wanted to create the same in Kumamoto - buildings which will last century after century.' Mr Hosokawa 'taught people not to depend on the central government', says Mr Yamauchi. An advocate of decentralisation, the governor had perennial run-ins with the bureaucrats of Tokyo, to whom he once famously claimed he had to defer if the prefecture wanted a bus stop moved. Between leaving the governorship (he declared that corruption sets in if politicians stay in office too long) and founding the Japan New party last year, he was invited to chair a government commission on administrative reform. He suggests that the rejection of its findings by ministry officials and by conservatives in the ruling Liberal Democratic party, to which Mr Hosokawa had until then been loyal, was one factor convincing him that the established order in Tokyo had to be overturned. His economic record is mixed. Kumamoto still hovers around 30th out of the 47 prefectures, ranked by per capita income. Some 220 companies, including car component makers, moved to Kumamoto during his tenure, although it has so far failed to win foreign investment in manufacturing from abroad. This is despite a 'foreigners first' policy instituted by Mr Hosokawa offering preferential incentives to non-Japanese companies. One group of Kumamoto residents in particular is placing great faith in his ability as premier - the remaining victims of the Minamata poisoning scandal of the mid-1950s, when a chemical factory in the fishing town knowingly pumped mercury sludge into the bay, causing Japan's worst industrial pollution incident. As governor, Mr Hosokawa sought in vain to break a legal logjam in the battle for compensation for the thousands disabled by eating tainted fish. Tokyo imposed a narrow definition of those entitled to compensation, and with the average age of sufferers now above 70, an early settlement 'will be a test of his ability in government', argues Mr Nobuya Hidaka, Kumamoto general secretary for the Japan Communist party, which will remain outside the national coalition. With fissures emerging within the seven-party coalition even before it takes office, and reform of the cash-consuming electoral system as almost the sole item on its agenda, Mr Hosokawa will have his work cut out to deliver even on that. There may be no time for other matters - least of all monument building. Editorial Comment, page 15</p>

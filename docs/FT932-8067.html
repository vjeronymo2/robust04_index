			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Engineers still wait to uncork champagne - The sector faces a slow recovery, according to the survey of the FT Six THE recession may officially be over, but the champagne is being kept on ice in Britain's battered engineering sector, which faces a slow, spasmodic recovery to 'normal' levels of business. The six engineering companies whose progress out of the recession is being tracked in the FT's occasional survey of the sector say conditions are improving - but not by much - and confidence within the customer base is picking up gradually. The good news is that further job cuts are mostly off the agenda, as long as the gradual upturn does not grind to a halt. At JCB, the construction equipment group, employees are even working a modest amount of overtime. But, significantly perhaps, those ubiquitous phrases of the past few months  -'We've definitely bottomed out' and 'It's not getting worse' - have not yet been laid to rest. The previous survey in the series, published on December 30, found faint signs of confidence returning to the customers of the FT Six. Since then, interest rates have been cut by another 1 percentage point. But the first four months of this year have shown that the engineers were right to be cautious in December about the pace of the recovery - recognising that it would take time for customers to feel confident about the stability of the interest rate and currency environment. This is how things are looking for the FT Six: Fenner, the power transmission and industrial conveyor belting group, announced its half-year results on Tuesday. Pre-tax profits dropped from Pounds 2.28m to Pounds 105,000, but Mr Peter Barker, chairman, said customer confidence was rising. With UK manufacturing output set to rise this year and next, the company was 'well placed to derive maximum advantage from the recovery that now appears to be underway.' At Senior Engineering Group, the tubing, boilers and ductwork company, volumes have improved in some consumer-related businesses, although not in more investment-related sectors where the lead times are longer. Mr John Bell, chief executive, says there is more confidence within industry, and speaks of 'a will to see things improve.' Overall, he had seen a gentle improvement in UK business conditions, but a normal level of activity was probably some months away, perhaps in the autumn. One hopeful sign comes in Senior's contract heat treatment business, which takes in metal components from a wide range of manufacturers and heats them for extra strength. Here, there has been a good improvement in volumes, says Mr Bell: 'This is a true indicator of the economy. It takes in business on a day-to-day basis, and there is nothing more instant than that.' Mr Peter Burton, chief executive of Bloxwich Engineering, says: 'I feel in my bones that perhaps the recession is over,' but he warns that there will be no sudden revival of activity for the Walsall-based car and truck parts company. The car side of Bloxwich's parts business has picked up, he says, due partly to continuing and forthcoming business from the Japanese transplants. But the truck parts business has yet to revive, and has not been helped by the receivership of Leyland-DAF, an important customer. Another 'chink' which Mr Burton points to is Bloxwich's tool-making business, where press tool activity has increased. 'To make cars, you need tools first,' says Mr Burton, 'and customers are now optimistic enough to release work.' Overseas markets, and particularly Germany, offer mixed prospects. On the one hand, Mr Burton says, 'We think the German economy is in a hell of a mess.' But he hopes Bloxwich can benefit from the more international sourcing policy at Volkswagen under the new purchasing director, Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua. The 600 Group, the producer and distributor of machine tools and materials handling equipment, has also been hit, at least in the short term, by the Leyland-DAF collapse. The engineering company has 50 per cent of the market for truck-mounted cranes, and one-third of its products in this sector went on Leyland-DAF Trucks, says Mr Colin Gaskell, managing director. Overall, Mr Gaskell is unable to report any 'vast upturn' in the UK market, but there are a lot more inquiries around, he says. 'Our sales guys are much more optimistic than they have been.' The rate of purchase by end-users of machine tools, as opposed to dealers, has picked up. As at Bloxwich, Mr Gaskell is concerned about economic conditions on the Continent, which look 'pretty sick.' But he thinks that the devaluation of sterling has created an opportunity to sell machine tools in Germany, where customers might refuse to pay the customary premium for domestically-produced equipment if it becomes excessive. At JCB, the period from April-June is a traditional stage of increased buying by plant-hirers and other users of earthmoving equipment, so gauging any upturn is difficult. But Mr Gilbert Johnston, deputy chairman, feels that the UK market 'just has to be past the worst. 'Things are better, but it's not something we're jumping up and down about,' he says. In broad terms, activity could still rise by between 25 and 30 per cent to reach normal levels for the domestic market. Mr Johnston says the improvement will be gradual. Indeed he hopes this is the case, as that would produce a more stable and sustainable recovery. Mr Johnston is not expecting any immediate help from the all-important UK construction market, where activity was described recently as still at dangerously low levels. Taking a five-year view, however, he says it looks good for improvement. Finally, Mr Reg Bricknell, managing director of Posiva, the gears and drives producer, does not think that the recession is over, but there are pockets of industry producing more orders. Although German-owned Posiva has had to adjust to the effect of the sterling devaluation on the products it brings in from Germany, it is also benefiting from increased activity among customers exporting from the UK. The order intake in the first three months of the year was 36 per cent higher than the comparable period of 1992. 'This is not just green shoots,' Mr Bricknell says. 'It's due to the efforts from our salesmen.' The increase in business has been helped by equipment that Posiva is supplying to the big UK builders of power stations and water treatment plants in Asia. In the home market, though, Mr Bricknell does not yet see sufficient stability to prompt confidence that activity will continue upwards. He would like to see a few more months of the same growth trend before declaring the recession over.</p>

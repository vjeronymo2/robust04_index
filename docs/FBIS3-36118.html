The U.S.-Latvian military cooperation will substantially  expand this year, said Willian Perry, under secretary for  defense. The cooperation will include visits of U.S. warships  to Latvia's ports, joint maneuvers with U.S. and NATO's Armed  Forces.    The U.S. president has received a draft resolution to lift  restrictions of shipments of all kind of war materials to the  Baltic states, Perry said.    Latvian parliamentarians voiced a concern over the lack of  any security guarantees what was said to be potentially  dangerous against the background of the political climate in  Russia becoming worse.    U.S. officials reiterated that the Baltics were granted a  priority status in the American foreign policies. Consequently,  the absence of concrete security guarantees should not be  overdramatized because formal guarantees are actually redundant.    The United States had never signed a formal security treaty  with Israel but the existing relationship allows to attain the  desired result without a formal document, U.S. speakers said.    The Latvian-U.S. relationship is also very close to similar  attitudes, they noted.    The Latvian delegation met with Senator Carl Levin and  discussed the potential U.S. financial support for the  dismantling of the Russian military early-warning antimissile  radar in Skrunda, Latvia. The senator promised to study the  request.    The group also visited Anthony Lake, president's adviser on  national security issues.</p>

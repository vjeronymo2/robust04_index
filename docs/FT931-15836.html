			<p>930111 FT  11 JAN 93 / Sihanouk climbs down PRINCE Norodom Sihanouk of Cambodia is to co-operate with the UN peackeeping mission in Phnom Penh, less than a week after announcing he was unable to work with the organisation as it had not stopped political violence, writes Victor Mallet in Bangkok. In a weekend statement, Prince Sihanouk also said he had called a meeting of Cambodia's Supreme National Council - which includes the four main political factions - at his residence in Beijing on January 28. His climbdown followed two hours of talks in Beijing on Friday with Mr Yasushi Akashi, head of the UN transitional authority in Cambodia.</p>

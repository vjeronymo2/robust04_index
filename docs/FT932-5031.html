			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / Gardening: Fruitful inspiration for border browsers - Book / Bridget Bloom on the latest in reading for gardeners WHAT DO you expect from a gardening book? Inspiration? Practical advice and a faultless index? The widest possible selection of plants? Obviously, the answer must vary depending on the sort of gardener you are. But I suspect that no gardener ever actually reads a gardening book, at least to begin with. Browsing is what it is about, whether to dream away the long winter evenings or decide which runner bean to plant in the spring. Whether the problem is what to put into terracotta pots or how to design a new water garden, a single book will rarely do. Considerations of this sort, at least, must move publishers. Why else, in a single spring, would you find several more volumes on gardening in containers to add to those already on the market? Maybe container gardening has become more fashionable but this spring also sees a number of new or reprinted books on gardening in the shade and in dry or damp soils, subjects which have been with us for a very long while. The most ambitious of these new reference books bears the imprint of the Royal Horticultural Society. Four titles open what the publishers, Conran Octopus, bill as a 'new library . . . combining expert advice, inspirational photographs and practical information . . . for the new and experienced gardener.' Slimmish volumes of about 130 pages each, the four books cover shady, flower, glasshouse and container gardening, written respectively by Jane Taylor, Helen Dillon, John Watkins and Thomasina Tarling. Each costs Pounds 15.99. Twelve books are promised altogether, with cottage, alpine and landscape gardening expected next year. The format of these new volumes is easy to follow with good pictures and coloured drawings, a good index and in each a succinct list of 'key plants' and key points to note for each of the seasons. Do not expect particularly good writing or necessarily happy editing. (One chapter is headed 'Containers for Situations'). But the series should prove a useful addition to any library shelf. Plants For Dry Gardens, by Jane Taylor (Francis Lincoln, Pounds 18.99) nicely complements her volume in the RHS series. Jane Taylor appears again in a different series with a volume on Climbers and Wallplants for Year Round Colour, alongside Peter McHoy's Containers and Baskets (Ward Lock Pounds 14.99). I find these volumes less well produced and more pedestrian than the RHS series but not so poor as the (admittedly, at Pounds 4.99, much cheaper) Letts Guide To Garden Design. These hardback volumes (covering containers again as well as Walls and Screens, The Small Garden and The Herb and Kitchen Garden) are quite glossily produced. But for me they commit the unforgiveable crime of failing to identify gardens singled out for praise: each one of the four volumes carries a - different - photograph of Sybil Spencer's herb garden at York Gate, near Leeds in Yorkshire, without once identifying it. From publisher J M Dent comes the classic Perennial Garden Plants by Graham Stuart Thomas, first published in 1976 and Alan Mitchell's Gardeners Book of Trees - the latter not for newcomers since there are very few photographs. Roy Lancaster's Trees For Your Garden might be better there, though more expensive at Pounds 16.99 (publisher Aidan Ellis). For my money however, it is still very hard to beat Hillier's Manual of Trees and Shrubs - both the longer and the 'picture' version, which started life as a nurseryman's catalogue. And so on to more elaborate reference books. One splendid and lavishly illustrated volume to appear this spring is Headline's Illustrated Encyclopaedia of Roses, edited by Mary Moody with Peter Harkness as consultant and rather competitively priced at Pounds 19.99. This shows however why gardeners so frequently need several volumes on a chosen subject. My 'bible' for roses is again a nurseryman's catalogue: and I happen to know that David Austin's is the correct listing of Blush Noisette, for he and not the encyclopedia mentions one of that climbing rose's chief asset, its wonderful clove-like scent. There are several other examples where the two diverge, not to the new book's credit. And so to a couple of books which purport to be rather more complete gardening guides in that both aim to take the gardener through design, planning and planting of a range of different gardens, from cottage to classic, and kitchen to container. Initially, I was not sure what to make of Nigel Colborne's Short Cuts To Great Gardens, (Conran Octopus Pounds 16.99). Like the 'crusty professionals' he quotes, after only ten years of strictly amateur gardening I tend to believe also that there are no real short cuts. But never mind. The idea that there might be is a challenge in itself and as befits a well-known television gardener and RHS show judge, his advice is sensible and easy to follow. This would certainly be a book to have if you were starting from scratch. However, I am less keen on the rather pretentiously named Garden Source Book (Pounds 25 from Mitchell Beazley) which I find less imaginative (and considerably less tasteful) than another 'bible' of mine, John Brooke's infinitely adaptable The Small Garden, originally published by Cavendish House in 1977.</p>

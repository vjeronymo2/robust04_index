			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Teresa Salazar from the "Early Morning" newscast] </F>   [Text] Six opposition candidates accepted the invitation  Ernesto Zedillo, Mexican presidential candidate for the  Institutional Revolutionary Party, made to hold a debate. The  National Action Party said it will think about it.    Most of the candidates of the small parties accepted  Zedillo's invitation to hold a new public debate over their  presidential proposals. Diego Fernandez de Cevallos turned down  the invitation but later said he would think about it.    [Begin Fernandez de Cevallos recording] I have said I  believe  it is improper to gather the nine candidates at the same place  at the same time, however, my secretary general told me, using a  phrase that has become famous and that has been used by  presidents: I only ask you not to be fearful. [Solo les pido que  no se hagan bolas]. [end recording]    Alvaro Perez Trevino, presidential candidate for the  Authentic Party of the Mexican Revolution, accepted the  invitation, but said the only drawback would be if the debate  were used to attack another candidate.    Jorge Gonzalez Torres, presidential candidate for the Green  Ecologist Party, said the debate represents a point of hope for  democracy which is demanded by the Mexican people.    Cecilia Soto, candidate for the Labor Party, said she is  ready for the debate.    [Begin Soto recording] I understand it is a ratification of  his 12 May proposal to hold a debate. I am ready to hold a  debate, tonight if necessary. [end recording]    Rafael Aguilar Talamantes from the Cardenist Front for  National Reconstruction Party, accepted the debate and  designated a representative for the negotiations prior to the  talks.    Pablo Emilio Madero, candidate from the National Opposition  Union, said a civilized step forward in Mexican democracy  depends on the confrontation of government programs.    Marcela Lombardo from the Popular Socialist Party confirmed  her participation in the debate as long as it is a display of  proposals, projects, and possible solutions to the country's  problems.</p>

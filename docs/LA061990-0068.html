Silver Putnam, 6, and her stepsister, Kristine  Johnson, 3, were last seen when they left their home in Pioneertown with Alan  Erickson, San Bernardino County sheriff's spokesman Jim Bryant said.  </P> <P> Erickson, 36, told the girls' mother, Linda Johnson, that he was going to buy  motorcycle parts. He and the girls left in a white pickup truck that he  borrowed from Johnson's boyfriend. When Erickson and the girls had not returned  by midnight, Johnson called sheriff's deputies. An all-points bulletin was  issued to authorities in areas Erickson was known to frequent, including the  High Sierra.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Budget Minister Herbert Van Rompuy, Flemish </F> Christian People's Party chairman, by Guy Daloze and Pierre  Loppe; place and date not given: "The Budget and the `Affairs'"]    [Excerpts]  <H5>  Reconquering Hearts and Spirits </H5>   [LA LIBRE BELGIQUE] There is the risk of a political problem  arising: We may have to find another prime minister. What do  you think of a European career for Prime Minister Jean-Luc  Dehaene?    [Van Rompuy] No comment.    [LA LIBRE BELGIQUE] If necessary, could you succeed Dehaene?    [Van Rompuy] Become a colleague of Berlusconi? [laughs] No  comment. I will be seeing Dehaene after the Easter holidays,  but still, I am not going to give him my advice now through  other people.    [LA LIBRE BELGIQUE] Our polls show that the CVP [Christian  People's Party] is recovering.    [Van Rompuy] I am pleased.... Two things are coming  together. First, the fate of the CVP has always been linked with  the fate of the government. The government has been doing  better in recent months since it implemented its global plan and  refused to give in to pressure. Second, we have been able to  manage a transition of renewal in the CVP. I have accepted my  responsibilities, and I think I have played a major role in  helping us get over the crisis. I think I was right, even in  the choice of prime minister. I sparked the renewal of the  party which, as I had wanted, can only come through renewing the  personnel.    [LA LIBRE BELGIQUE] Do you think you will again catch up  with  the Flemish Liberal Democrats (VLD)?    [Van Rompuy] The European elections are very important. I am  confident, and if the CVP could remain the leading party in  Belgium, it would be a psychological blow for the Liberals.  Today they are so euphoric and arrogant, as if the country  belonged to them (with just 15 percent of the national vote in  the polls).    [LA LIBRE BELGIQUE] Are the traditional political parties  capable of withstanding the "affairs?" Is not a major upheaval  necessary?    [Van Rompuy] You should see what remains of this upheaval in  Italy. It makes me shudder to see that the fascists look likely  to be included in the government....    However, there are other trends: In the French regional  elections, the alternative parties were unsuccessful.    The traditional parties must be aware that we are going  through a very serious period of crisis in political legitimacy.  They have to reconquer hearts and spirits and once more give  people confidence in the system with a series of global measures  for renewal. The political system must abandon its immobility  and its feeling of ingratitude and conspiracy (the feeling that  "everyone is against us"). Of course, there are excesses and,  when I see the Flemish press printing complete lies, I am  shocked that people are being discredited merely to improve  circulation figures and to make money. However, I also know that  there are serious files implicating the worlds of politics,  insurance and trade unionism, and the worst thing we could do is  deny the existence of these problems.    The people must see that we are ready for change. The  current climate is the worst, since no one knows what the future  holds in store. An economic crisis could strengthen extremist  reactions and if, at that time, democracy is not entrenched  sufficiently with the population, certain elements could profit  from the situation.    [LA LIBRE BELGIQUE] The opinion of the Central Committee on  Competition is worrying. What political conclusions can you  draw?    [Van Rompuy] The situation is perhaps not as alarming as  people make out. The National Bank does have a significant  balance of payments surplus. We should therefore relativize the  "share of the market" reasoning. Let's wait for September's  report. The government has recently decided on the global plan.  We must assess its effects and impact on the economy at the  beginning of fall. It is still too early.    [LA LIBRE BELGIQUE] The measures proposed in the plan have  been affected by measures taken in other countries, and  especially the wage moderation granted in Germany....    [Van Rompuy] Yes, but with the notable difference that in  Belgium we had to impose moderation....    [LA LIBRE BELGIQUE] What do you think of the divisions among  your partners on this crucial subject?    [Van Rompuy] Since October, the consensus has been that the  economy is in serious crisis. This is always the case when  harsh measures have to be taken. The situation has worsened  since the failure of the social pact.    [LA LIBRE BELGIQUE] Do you think that the Belgian social  model is threatened?    [Van Rompuy] In a time of crisis the threat is always there.  Remember that in 1981 an interprofessional agreement was signed  imposing a wage freeze. Two months later, [former Prime  Minister] Martens launched an additional rescue plan. In 1982,  when the currency was devalued, no social agreement was  achieved. In such cases, it is up to the government, as  guardian of the common interest, to take action.    [LA LIBRE BELGIQUE] Will Dehaene's team accept its  responsibilities? Will it do so in September?    [Van Rompuy] Everything will depend on the new opinion of  the  Central Committee and the attitude of the social partners. Will  they manage to reach an agreement this time? They will have a  month to do so. After that, we will intervene.    [LA LIBRE BELGIQUE] If the current scenario were to occur  again, would you act....    [Van Rompuy] We are obliged to by law....    [LA LIBRE BELGIQUE] Do you share the relative optimism of  the  governor of the National Bank who considers that we are "out of  the crisis?"    [Van Rompuy] I was the first to say so! Our darkest postwar  year was 1993. In December, the Bank recorded its first jump,  which was then confirmed in January and February. Technically,  it is true, we are out of recession, but with 1 percent in 1994  we are not yet on the road to normal growth. Employment only  takes off again when the economy has recovered. By the end of  1994, I would like to see a reduction in the federal debt  accompanied by the first signs of an improvement in the  employment situation. Until now, our crime is that we have been  over-pessimistic. We have forgotten that there is an economic  cycle....    [LA LIBRE BELGIQUE] Hearing you speak, anyone would think  the  employers have been overdramatizing things....    [Van Rompuy] The Belgian Employers' Federation (FEB) is  still  dominated by a few major industrial groups who are justifiably  concerned. I do not want to accuse anyone merely on the basis  of assumptions, but the employers know full well that the public  authorities can impose measures. It is therefore in their best  interests to dramatize the situation.    [LA LIBRE BELGIQUE] Positive discourse can also help get us  out of difficulty....    [Van Rompuy] Very true! We can see a note of confidence  returning to consumers and investors. If we have to point out  what is going badly, to be truthful we also have to say what is  going well. Crisis is also a psychological thing.    [LA LIBRE BELGIQUE] Is it to avoid compromising the recovery  that the government implemented such a "soft" budgetary control?    [Van Rompuy] The social pact, which guided my actions in the  government, has turned into the global plan. We have listened,  but we have also stood up to them. We have not given in. The  country has felt governed despite the various malaises.    Look at the figures. The difference between income and  expenditure is 17 billion Belgian francs [BFr], while the  reduction target is BFr60 billion. With the global plan, the  measures applied on 1 April, and the slow economic recovery, it  would be unreasonable to take further measures affecting  spending power. Budgetary control has made it possible to  resolve the problems without overdramatization. The new  technique has borne fruit. We will consider the budget for 1995  in the summer. Everything will depend on changes in the  short-term interest rate. This has yet to reach its lowest  level. The government is banking on 6 percent. Maybe we will  go below that, with a stronger franc. [passage omitted].    [LA LIBRE BELGIQUE] You are starting to plan the 1995  budget.  You also mentioned the economic and psychological aspects of  budgetary control. In July, a third aspect will come into play,  a political aspect with the approach of the local elections.  That will expose you taking an even "softer" approach.    [Van Rompuy] We will see when the time comes. We must  consider the economic situation. Let me also point out one  thing: The budget will be worked out between the European and  local elections.    [LA LIBRE BELGIQUE] It will, then, be a difficult budget,  politically speaking.    [Van Rompuy] Everything depends on the gap we will have to  make up.    [LA LIBRE BELGIQUE] Will you ask the towns and the regions  to  contribute to this effort? Some people are reluctant....    [Van Rompuy] They will have to make the efforts determined  by  the High Finance Committee. However, we live in a system where  there is no hierarchy of standards, and where the executives and  assemblies act totally independently. They therefore will have  to participate in the effort of their own free will. We agreed  that the different bodies would work together, and that there  will be no disputes over the figures and the method if the  Finance Committee issues a new opinion. Everyone then will have  to accept their responsibilities, and we will see who is  responsible if we do not respect the standards laid down in the  Maastricht Treaty. The increase in spending of the towns and  regions considerably exceeds the spending of the federal  authority and even social security spending, which is a  situation that cannot be allowed to continue in the future. Of  tax and nontax revenue, 60 percent is kept by the federal  authority while BFR40 billion goes to the towns, regions, and  social security. However, public opinion seems to think that it  is the federal authority that receives the full weight of the  increase in taxation. We are justified in feeling a little  frustrated.</p>

			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Enlarged Sunleigh warns on profits Sunleigh, the leisure products group which made a Pounds 19.2m diversification into prams last June, yesterday issued a trading statement suggesting that profits for the second half of 1994 would be 'small', writes Simon Davies. The shares fell 1 1/2 p to 4 1/2 p on the announcement that the group had suffered 'a difficult third quarter', due to a downturn in sales in continental Europe, particularly for its Laser dinghies and Dart catamarans. The group also makes Powakaddy motorised golf trolleys, and the purchase of Maclaren moved it into a third consumer durables sector. The acquisition was funded by a placing of 320m shares at 6p, resulting in a fourfold increase in share capital. Mr Alan Hancock, chief executive, said Maclaren's profits for the third quarter had exceeded 1993, but that it had a strong seasonal bias towards the first half. Maclaren has introduced new product lines and substantially reduced its cost base. Sunleigh retains a cash surplus of Pounds 650,000, and will pay a nominal dividend for the second half of the year, its first distribution since 1989.</p>

			<p><P> November 21, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> The San Diego County Grand Jury praised the city school district Tuesday for  recent efforts to eliminate the eyesore of Dana Junior High School on Point  Loma. The school, shuttered since 1983 because of declining enrollment, has  been heavily vandalized while the school board wrestled with what to do with  the site.  </P> <P> In September, trustees agreed to move forward with a plan to rehabilitate the  13-acre site and consolidate there the offices of counselors, health workers  and other administrators now spread throughout the city. The school's massive  auditorium would be made available for community use, and its sprawling  playground would be graded and seeded to provide new baseball fields for  nearby, cramped Point Loma High School.  </P> <P> The grand jury, in a brief report Tuesday, said the district should move ahead  as quickly as possible with the estimated $6-million renovation, which has the  backing of a large segment of the Point Loma community.  </P></p>

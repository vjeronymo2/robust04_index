			<p>Language: <F P=105> German, </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Dieter Abendroth, BMFT (Federal Ministry of </F> Research and Technology)]    [Text] Successful Model    Altogether 183 firms have so far been supported by the  government in accordance with the BMFT"s "Assisting  Technology-Oriented Enterprise Establishments" (TOU) model  experiment. Jointly with the Information Service, the BMFT is  devising a "program - implementation of assistance - founders of  firms" sequence.    It is by means of the TOU model experiment that the Federal  Ministry of Research and Technology (BMFT) aims to have  technological enterprises established in the new Federal States.  The assistance extends over the length of time it takes an  enterprise to develop its eventually profitable product and thus  over the lean initial period of its existence. Not only funds  for product development but also advice on organizing an  enterprise and raising private capital for product marketing are  made available at that time.    By last August 183 such innovative enterprises have thus  been  assisted with a total sum of about 123 million DM. New top-notch  workshops have been built. The results of earlier research done  in the GDR (German Democratic Republic) are being successfully  converted into novel products. So far most projects originate in  measurement, medical, and processing practice. Next in numbers  are projects in the fields of microelectronics, software tools,  environmental engineering, optics, and biotechnology.    What has been learned from the model experiment is that the  enterprise founders are by far highly qualified persons (see  diagram). The distribution of enterprises among the new Federal  States duplicates the distribution of previous research and  industrial sites among them. At the top is Saxony, followed by  East Berlin, and Thuringia.    Database Diagram (Pie Chart): 377 enterprise founders in  second phase of approved projects:    1. no data available (8.2%)    2. others (no education, some study completed, military  training) (5.0%)    3. professional education (technical, manual trade,  business)  (3.7%)    4. technician (1.9%)    5. graduate economist or industrial management specialist  (1.1%)    6. graduate engineer, physicist, chemist, et al.  (41.4%)    7. other degrees (2.1%)    8. engineering degree (36.6%)    Not surprisingly, there remain gaps in knowledge of and  experience in industrial management and marketing techniques.  The enterprise founders try to close these gaps by continuing  their education or by measuring up to Western partners endowed  with relevant skills. They are aided here by consultations with  TOU-Project carriers and by seminars organized by them.    In the meantime, a great many thus assisted enterprises have  completed their development stage and have begun marketing their  products. A quite encouraging picture emerges here: The first  firms among them are slowly gaining a foothold on the German  market and on the international market as well.</p>

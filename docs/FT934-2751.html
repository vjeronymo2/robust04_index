			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / Food &amp; Drink: Sicily and its seasons - J D F Jones enjoys the delights of a soft-centred book 'The aspect of those monumental dishes of macaroni was worthy of the quivers of admiration they evoked. The burnished gold of the crusts, the fragrance of sugar and cinnamon they exuded, were but preludes to the delights released from the interior when the knife broke the crust; first came a spice-laden haze, then chicken livers, hard boiled eggs, sliced ham, chicken and truffles in masses of piping hot, glistening macaroni, to which the meat juice gave an exquisite hue of suede . . . (they) ate without thinking of anything, and without realising that the food seemed so delicious because sensuality was circulating in the house . . .' That comes from Lampedusa in one of our century's greatest novels, The Leopard, If you have ever been curious about the mysteries and delights of Sicilian cuisine, Anna Tasca Lanza's deliciously-illustrated, softest-centred book, The Heart of Sicily (Cassell, Pounds 18.99, 255 pages), will enchant you. She is mistress of the Regaleali estate and the story is an unabashed promotion of its commercial wine operation (she also runs a cookery school there). But the book is about food, not wine, laced with recipes of traditional Sicilian dishes, and takes the form of a seasonal sequence, starting with Pasta con le Sarde in springtime when the wild fennel is fresh and moving through to the winter season of olives and citrus. Sicily is of course one of the cradles of our civilisation - we are shown how Regaleali's head shepherd makes cheese every day in a manner that has scarcely changed since the ancient Greeks. Its cuisine and culture have been successively influenced by Greeks and Romans, Arabs and Normans, French and Spaniards. But the Mediterranean tradition was invaded by the French via the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies in the 19th century, which brought in the 'monzu' (ie monsieur), a head chef with a knowledge of consommes, foie gras, cream and butter. The book, full of family and landscape, is evidently directed at an American readership, but that need not matter. Read here of Estratto di Pomodoro (how the estate kitchen annually reduces 4000 lbs of tomatoes to 240 lbs of extract); of wondrous, oil-drenched versions of melanzane (eggplant); of dishes of wild rabbit; of fried courgette flowers ('Mario takes the flowers for Fiori di Zucca Fritti to serve with drinks before dinner or to include in a Fritto Misto. He fills the flower with as much diced mozzarella as it can hold and a small piece of anchovy and folds it over. Then he dredges it in flour, dips it in egg wash, coasts it with breadcrumbs, and fries it . . .') It's all ecstatic stuff.</p>

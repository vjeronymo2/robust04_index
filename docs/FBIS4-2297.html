			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Sofia Wu] </F>   [Text] Taipei, April 7 (CNA) -- President Li Teng-hui said  Thursday [7 April] he is optimistic about the economic prospects  of Southeast Asia and Taiwan's role within the region.    "Southeast Asia is one of the fastest-growing areas and is  attracting ever-increasing attention from other parts of the  world," Li said while meeting with a group of foreign bank  executives here to attend the 29th Conference of Governors of  Southeast Asian Central Banks (SEACEN).    Li said Southeast Asian countries have become less reliant  on  markets outside the region while intraregional trade and  investment has risen steadily since 1990. "I believe this trend  will continue in the years ahead," he noted.    In line with the trend, Li said, Taiwan has adjusted its  overseas investment strategy and has encouraged entrepreneurs to  increase investment in Southeast Asian nations.    Li said he exchanged views on promoting bilateral economic  cooperation and regional economic development with leaders from  the Philippines, Indonesia and Thailand during his February trip  to those countries. "We'll continue to strive for closer  economic ties with countries in the region," Li added.    Those present at the meeting included Lord Kingsdown, former  governor of the Bank of England, Dr. J.E. Esmael, executive  director of the International Monetary Fund, and central bank  governors from 10 SEACEN member states -- South Korea, the  Philippines, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Nepal, Myanmar  [Burma], Indonesia, Sri Lanka and the host Republic of China  [ROC].    The SEACEN meeting opened Wednesday and will close Friday. A  joint statement will be issued at the end of the meeting  reaffirming member states' commitment to gradually liberalizing  their financial markets and promoting regional economic and  financial cooperation.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The government will probably re-edit the provisional  measure on the URV [Real Value Unit]. The Congress plenary  gathered this morning to vote on the measure. The session,  however, was suspended after an agreement with government  leaders in Congress.    The congressional session began with the presence of 113  members of Congress, which is enough of a quorum to initiate the  session but not enough to vote on the provisional measure that  creates the URV. The congressional rural bloc, which has 200  members, was obstructing the session [through their absence].  They will only approve the provisional measure if the government  accepts an amendment guaranteeing the correction of the minimum  prices for agricultural products through the URV.    Since not enough members of Congress turned up for the  session, the Congress director board and government leader in  the Chamber of Deputies, Deputy Luiz Carlos Santos, decided to  suspend the session. It is now thought that the government will  tomorrow re-edit the provisional measure that creates the URV.    [Begin Santos recording] It would be irresponsible to  attempt  to have the provisional measure voted on without the certainty  of holding a majority of votes in favor of its approval.  Therefore, lacking the certainty of having the provisional  measure approved, the government now must probably re-edit the  measure. [end recording]</p>

			<p><P> December 6, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MARKET CHANGES FOR ANIMATION ART CELS;  </P> <P> AUCTIONS: RECENT L.A. AND N.Y. SALES SHOW TOP PRICES FALLING BUT THERE IS A  HIKE IN MID-PRICE PURCHASES.  </P> <P> Recent auctions of artwork from animated films in Los Angeles and New York City  indicate that top prices are falling but that the number of buyers for  mid-priced works is increasing.  </P> <P> Monday night, at an auction at the Burbank Hilton, the highest prices were paid  for three cel and background set-ups from Disney features: Snow White kissing  Dopey goodby at the end of "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" (1937) brought  $22,000, well within its pre-sale estimate of $20,000 to $30,000; Cinderella  surrounded by the mice from the 1950 film sold for $19,800, slightly below the  estimate of $20,000 to $30,000; and Bambi standing in a snow bank from the 1942  film fetched $15,950, somewhat above its estimated price of $9,000 to $13,000.  </P> <P> All but 20 of the 271 lots sold, for a total of $509,630.  </P> <P> The Burbank sale followed the pattern set at a Nov. 28 auction at Christie's  East in New York, with the exception of gaveled prices versus estimates. A cel  and background of Alice talking with the Caterpillar from the 1951 Walt Disney  feature "Alice in Wonderland," sold for $82,500, twice the pre-sale estimate of  $30,000 to $40,000. A cel and background set-up of Mickey and Minnie Mouse from  the 1935 short "On Ice" brought $46,200 -- eight times its estimate of $5,000  to $7,000, but a set-up of Mickey leading the musicians from the 1935 classic  cartoon "The Band Concert" sold for $55,000, matching the presale estimate of  $50,000 to $60,000. Of the 349 lots offered, more than 80% found buyers, for a  sale total of $1,035,925.  </P> <P> The sale prices represent a substantial decline from May, 1988, when a buyer at  Christie's paid $286,000 and $181,500 for two cel and background set-ups from  the 1934 black-and-white Disney cartoon "Orphan's Benefit."  </P> <P> "We're getting good, strong prices in all areas of the market," said Joshua  Arfer, director of animation and collectibles at Christie's. "Some prices might  have been exceptionally high in the past because certain collectors were  willing to go higher to get certain items for their collections, but we started  getting more realistic prices about a year ago."  </P> <P> "More people are moving into the middle ground," said dealer Howard Lowery, who  conducted Monday night's auction. "They start out with pieces that may sell for  a few hundred dollars, then, as they become more knowledgeable, they expand  their collections with pieces in the $2,000-to-$5,000 range. I think Monday  night's sale indicates that despite bad news and a leveling off in prices,  people want to continue building collections of animation art."  </P> <P> Other sales scheduled: On Wednesday, Lowery's Burbank gallery will host the  first American exhibit and sale of artwork from the Will Vinton Studio, the  creators of the commercials featuring the animated clay figures of the  California Raisins. The exhibition will include cels from the Saturday-morning  television series starring the Raisins ($70 to $240), limited-edition  sculptures ($890 to $2,950) and clay figures that appeared in some of Vinton's  films ($2,500 to $10,000).  </P> <P> On Dec. 15, Sotheby's will auction 283 lots of cels and backgrounds from the  1989 Disney hit "The Little Mermaid" in New York. Estimated prices range from  $1,000 to $1,500 for images of the minor characters, Scuttle and Flounder, to  $10,000 to $15,000 for a three-cel and background set-up of Eric and Ariel  driving through the forest.  </P></p>

			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / International Company News: Northwest Air stays in the red NORTHWEST Airlines, the fourth largest carrier in the US and one taken private via a Dollars 3.65bn leveraged buy-out in 1989, made an after-tax loss of Dollars 44.5m in the first quarter of 1992. This compared with the net loss of Dollars 61.6m in the same period a year earlier, when the Gulf war seriously disrupted traffic flows. 'While our first-quarter results reflected a moderate improvement from the Gulf war-depressed levels of 1991, this improvement fell far short of acceptable long-term performance targets,' said John Dasburg, chief executive. Northwest's results means the only big US carrier to show a profit in the first three months of 1992 was American Airlines, which turned in a tiny Dollars 20m surplus. Mr Dasburg, like many of his competitors, blamed the 'continued sluggishness in the US economy'. He also blamed recent weakness in the Japanese market. Northwest has a large Pacific route network. The airline's revenues in the first quarter rose 17.1 per cent to Dollars 1.92bn, while expenses climbed 14.6 per cent to Dollars 1.99bn. NWA, the carrier's parent company, fared even worse. After bearing the brunt of lease and interest costs, it reported a Dollars 103.1m after-tax loss in the first quarter, compared with a loss of Dollars 158.1m in the first quarter of 1991. Air Canada posted a first-quarter loss of CDollars 164m (USDollars 137.8m), or CDollars 2.23 a share, much higher than analysts expected, writes Robert Gibbens. The result compares with a loss of CDollars 100m, or CDollars 1.35, a year earlier. Revenues dipped 5 per cent to CDollars 827m. The latest period includes a CDollars 21m provision for staff reductions, against CDollars 36m a year earlier. The loss was CDollars 63m higher also because of a change in tax status. On an operating basis, results were down 3 per cent year-to-year. Fewer travellers, ticket price wars, and lower cargo revenues more than offset lower fuel costs and lower interest rates. Rolls-Royce Canada will maintain the engines used in all USAir's 88 Rolls-Royce-powered aircraft at its Montreal overhaul plant, under a CDollars 100m multi-year contract.</p>

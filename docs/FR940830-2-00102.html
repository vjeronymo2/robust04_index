(``California SunCare'') engaged in a combination and conspiracy, in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. &sect;1, to fix the price of indoor tanning products sold by California SunCare to dealers throughout the United States. The complaint alleges that, in furtherance of this conspiracy, California SunCare: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) established and communicated to dealers a minimum resale price for indoor tanning products from California SunCare; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) obtained agreements from dealers to maintain the minimum price as a condition of receiving and continuing to receive indoor tanning products from California SunCare. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The complaint also alleges that as a result of the combination and conspiracy, prices of indoor tanning products have been fixed and maintained, and competition in sales of indoor tanning products has been restrained. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The complaint alleges that the combination and conspiracy is illegal, and seeks to enjoin California SunCare from continuing or renewing the alleged combination or conspiracy and from engaging in any combination or conspiracy or adopting any practice or plan having a similar purpose or effect. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The United States and California SunCare have stipulated that the proposed Final Judgment may be entered after compliance with the APPA, unless the United States withdraws its consent. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Court's entry of the proposed Final Judgment will terminate the action, except that the Court will retain jurisdiction over the matter for possible further proceedings to construe, modify or enforce the Judgment, or to punish violations of any of its provisions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> II <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Description Of Practices Giving Rise To The Alleged Violation Of The Antitrust Laws <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> California SunCare, a California corporation, is a leading seller of indoor tanning products in the United States. Indoor tanning products sold by California SunCare are manufactured in California by California SunCare. California SunCare sells indoor tanning products to dealers which sell them to indoor tanning salons, which in turn sell them to consumers. Each year, California SunCare publishes a resale price schedule stating the price at which California SunCare believes its products should be resold by dealers to salons. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> During the period from November 1992 through April 1994, California SunCare confronted several dealers who were selling California SunCare products at a discount. The discounts included new customer discounts, discounts for trade association members, and free product after a certain number of bonus points had been earned on previous purchases. California SunCare obtained agreements from these dealers to maintain California SunCare's announced resale prices on indoor tanning products. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In April, 1994, the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice began an investigation into California SunCare's pricing policy. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNER> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / Arts: Sweet Bird takes flight - A new production at the National There were moments during Richard Eyre's new production of Tennessee Williams's Sweet Bird of Youth in the Lyttelton Theatre when the American accents affected by a predominantly British cast slipped so badly that I started fantasising about a production done unashamedly in English theatrical tones - a sort of Ascot Williams, full of Wildean pronunciation and poise, though without changing a word. The power of the play certainly would not be dimmed and a point about its dogged universality would, perversely, be made. Better, at any rate, such bizarre stylisation than a performance in which the linguistic mask of raw passion is constantly being dropped and something like an Ealing comedy seems snickering behind every other vowel. The worst offender is Richard Pasco's Boss Finley - Bible-bashing demagogue in the Southern American town of St. Cloud - whose public and private ranting passes muster but who cannot make his conversational tones convincing for a minute. Alison Fiske's Aunt Nonnie substitutes sobbing for speech tones, which is cheating a bit. Diane Langton's bar-propping southern belle, Miss Lucy, tries too hard with her accent and is often unintelligible; while Emma Amos as Boss Finley's pretty blonde but - so we discover - venereal daughter, Heavenly, is so measured of speech as to be incredible. Robert Knepper in the male lead as Chance Wayne is, though, a native speaker and with his James Dean looks, prettily muscled torso, and his authentic air of twitching, fast-talking, last-ditch desperation, altogether appropriate in this gigolo role (originally taken by Paul Newman). But even he produces oddities of speech. Lost in the hotel of heartbreak, he twice at the end tells his client, the ageing film star Alexandra del Lago, 'I couldn't go past my youth, but I've gone past it;' and each time emphasises the 'it' (rather than 'gone'), which does not quite work as an off-the-cuff allegorisation of the enemy Time. Chance is a chancer indeed; but when his head is held to the mirror by Alexandra and she exclaims 'Face it', I am not sure what I reckon to that particular pun: is it poetry or bathos? This would, of course, be a criticism of the text rather than the production. The text which Eyre uses is, however, specific to the production, compiled (as he writes) from five manuscript drafts, and considerably at variance with the Penguin edition. It is, for instance, not clear whether Chance is the direct or only indirect agent of Heavenly's infection. The last scene, in which Alexandra's career is restored by the phone-call that seems to finish his hopes, and he remains in St. Cloud to face emasculation by Boss Finley's men, is altered in a way that toys with the idea of redemption. There are strengths to Eyre's production - this final tableau suggesting purgation is perhaps one of them. I liked the indigo-violet sunset cyclorama, designed by Anthony Ward. Clare Higgins as Alexandra, aka The Princess Kosmonopolis, gives a wonderfully spirited and witty performance, her accent holding as she despatches such Dorothy Parkerisms as 'I'm being used. Why not? Even a dead race horse is used to make glue.'</p>

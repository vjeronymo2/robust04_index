The protest outside government headquarters coincided with  the start of a new parliamentary session at which members of the  National Assembly, chosen in inconclusive general elections last  November 29, took their oaths of office.    Eyewitnesses said there were loud explosions as police fired  stun grenades to keep back the crowd and clear the way after the  ceremony for the exit of Governor-general Sir Clement Arrindell,  Prime Minister Dr Kennedy Simmonds and other officials.    One of the two persons taken to hospital for treatment, had  head wounds after reportedly being struck with a baton by a  police officer.</p>

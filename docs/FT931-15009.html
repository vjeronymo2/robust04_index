			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / World Trade News: French farmers demand tough line against Gatt FRANCE'S largest farming union yesterday warned that campaigning for the March general election must not be allowed to weaken the country's resolve to stand up to the US in the Gatt agricultural trade negotiations. Mr Luc Guyau, president of the FNSEA, which groups most of France's 1.2m rural workforce, said he expected President-elect Clinton to be just as tough as his predecessor in defending American farmers' interests. Mr Guyau said France could not simply fall in with US plans for world agricultural trade, aimed at cutting back subsidised EC exports. It 'should use 1993 to move from speeches to action and veto the Washington agreement (between the EC and US on farm trade),' he said. He confirmed reports by agricultural suppliers such as Elf-Aquitaine and Rhone Poulenc that, as a result of EC reforms intended to curb production, and of uncertainties about the outcome of the Gatt talks, farmers had sharply reduced purchases of fertilisers and pesticides. One FNSEA official said the level fell last year to its lowest since 1960. Rhone Poulenc. See International Company News.</p>

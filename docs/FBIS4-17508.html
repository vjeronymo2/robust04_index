			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Ivan Ivanov] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 25 Apr -- "The position of the Russian  Government and president on Middle East is that settlement in  the area should be reached by peaceful means and that all armed  clashes should stop. Our position on settlement in former  Yugoslavia is the same," Viktor Chernomyrdin, chairman of the  Russian Federation Government, said today while answering  questions from journalists after the conclusion of his talks  with Yitzhaq Rabin, prime minister of the state of Israel.    The head of the Russian cabinet emphasized particularly that  the Russian government "intends to do everything possible to  reach a peace settlement in the Middle East".    At the end of intergovernment Russian-Israeli talks, which  lasted about two hours, Viktor Chernomyrdin and Yitzhaq Rabin  signed six agreements between the governments of the two  countries: on scientific and technical cooperation, on economic,  scientific and technical cooperation in the agro-industrial  complex, on avoiding dual taxation, on cooperation in health  care and medicine, on cooperation in education and culture and  on cooperation in tourism.    Highly assessing the importance of these agreements for the  development of bilateral relations, the Russian premier spoke  about the necessity for the conclusion of a Russian-Israeli  document on trade and economic relations in the immediate  future. He pointed out that Russia and Israel have favorable  prospects for expanding cooperation in various spheres including  the economy and military spheres.    It has become known to the ITAR-TASS correspondent from  sources in the Russian Government delegation that during the  talks various aspects of Russian-Israeli relations were  discussed in detail and that the two sides spoke in favor of  developing mutually beneficial trade and economic cooperation.  The importance of strengthening the friendly relations between  Russia and Israel, of which the broad cultural and humanitarian  ties are an important factor, was also pointed out during the  talks. A number of topical international issues including the  situation in the Middle East were also discussed.    Repying to the question whether the "Zhirinovskiy  phenomenon"  has any influence on increasing the threat of anti-Semitism in  Russia, Viktor Chernomyrdin gave the assurance that "a large  number of Jews live today in Russia but they are not threatened  by any kind of anti-Semitism and that no kind of `Zhirinovskiys'  will be able to whip up anti-Semitism." "Fascism or  anti-Semitism will not prevail in Russia. Though, of course,  there are certain forces which would like to agitate the  situation by bringing up the ethnic issue."</p>

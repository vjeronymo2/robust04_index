			<p><P> September 10, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GUNS  </P> <P> Houston uses the buzz words "cop-killer bullets" and "assault rifles," neither  of which are accurate descriptions -- they are are phrases manufactured by  anti-gun organizations. The correct terminology is "armor-piercing ammunition,"  designed for use by police and military.  </P> <P> Similarly, there is no such thing as an "assault rifle." If a 2x4 were used in  the attack, would you call it an "assault board"?  </P> <P> JON K. EVANS, Sherman Oaks  </P></p>

			<p>940823 FT  23 AUG 94 / Irish-Americans set to urge IRA ceasefire An influential Irish-American delegation which will visit Northern Ireland this week is expected to encourage the early announcement of an IRA ceasefire. The delegation, which is expected in Belfast tomorrow, will meet Mr Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA. The group is headed by Mr Bruce Morrison, a former congressman who is considered a close friend of Mr Bill Clinton, the US president. He will be accompanied by other prominent Irish-Americans including Mr Niall O'Dowd, publisher of the New York-based Irish Voice; the businessman Mr William Flynn, and Mr Charles Feeney, head of General Atlantic, the multinational. Mr Adams yesterday described persistent speculation about an IRA ceasefire as 'unhelpful' but said he considered the meeting with Mr Morrison 'an important one'. Mr Morrison played an important role in obtaining a temporary US visa for Mr Adams earlier this year in spite of a long-standing ban on his entering the US. During a visit to the province by Mr Morrison last year the IRA called an unofficial seven-day ceasefire. Speaking on Irish radio yesterday, Mr Morrison said: 'What needs to occur is that the violent activity needs to stop. If the IRA takes a decision to stop, steps must be taken to get the loyalist paramilitaries to stop as well. 'In the context of there not being paramilitary activity, it then falls to the political process to take steps to make it a permanent cessation.' The British and Irish governments have again stressed in recent days that only a permanent ceasefire by the IRA will allow Sinn Fein to enter into direct talks with the two governments and round-table talks with the other political parties in Northern Ireland. The US embassy in Dublin emphasised that the visit of the delegation was private and that no official business would be conducted by Mr Morrison. Nonetheless, Mr Morrison's team has maintained close contact with political figures in Northern Ireland over the past year, and is considered to be an unofficial line of communication between the republican leadership and the White House. The Northern Ireland Office said it had no meetings planned with the delegation, and unionist leaders said no meetings had been requested. The Ulster Unionist party said: 'If they are dealing with Sinn Fein directly I don't think the UUP will be interested in helping them with their deliberations.' Mr Morrison is best-known in Ireland for his role in getting US Congressional approval for a special lottery system to allocate a large quota of immigrant visas to Irish people wishing to settle in the US. More than 70,000 people from Ulster and the Republic have entered the US in the past five years.</p>

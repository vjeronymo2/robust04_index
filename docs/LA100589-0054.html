			<p><P> October 5, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DRIVEN TO THE BOOB TUBE  </P> <P> Re "Is the Sky Really Falling? Two USC Professors Claim Complexity of Life  Drives Us to the Boob Tube" (by Kathleen Hendrix, Sept. 25): TV is certainly  less addicting than crack. Like wine, food, shopping, work, gambling or sex, it  can be enjoyable in moderation but lethal in excess.  </P> <P> But TV is not the culprit, any more than clothing manufacturers, ice cream  makers or vineyards are. Addiction is the real, underlying problem in the  United States today.  </P> <P> Some behavioral science experts believe that we as a nation are displaying many  of the classic symptoms typical of an alcoholic or addict. Our productivity is  suffering. We're in debt. Our children are neglected. We don't fulfill our  responsibilities to our loved ones and communities. Our minds are dulled. Our  health is deteriorating. Our lives are becoming unmanageable.  </P> <P> Until we learn to cope with reality "clean and sober," we'll fall further and  further behind other, healthier nations in our ability to face up to tomorrow's  challenges and create the wholesome, productive, creative and enjoyable life  style we all seek.  </P> <P> LINDA BUZZELL, Venice  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 6, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Iranian President Ali Khamenei said that diplomatic relations with Washington  will not be possible until the United States abandons its hostile posture  toward Iran, Tehran Radio said. "There can be no change in our stance against  America, unless there is a change in American foreign policy toward Iran," the  official broadcast quoted Khamenei as saying. "What forces us into our present  stance against the United States is its hostile and extremely conspiratorial  behavior toward the Islamic Republic and the revolution. . . ." Khamenei said  improved relations would have to be preceded by the release of billions of  dollars in Iranian assets frozen by the United States after the Islamic  revolution in 1979.  </P></p>

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Moscow Russian Television Network in  Russian at 1725 GMT on 21 March in its "Details" program carries  a report on talks between correspondent Nikolay Svanidze and  Valentin Zorkin, member of the Constitutional Court, about the  latest reports of an alleged coup d'etat. Svanidze begins with  the following: "Hello! Details continue to focus on versions of  a coup d'etat that have been circulating in Moscow over the past  few days, the objective being the overthrow of President  Yeltsin. I say versions, because until recently people had been  talking about one, and now we have a second -- version number  two -- which is a virtual twin of version number one, but more  detailed. It contains the same list of names of the plotters:  Soskovets; Luzhkov; General Staff chief Kolesnikov; and Deputy  Defense Minister Kokoshin. In comparison with the first  version, the list also includes Kvasov, head of the government  apparatus. However, there are certain reservations about  participation in the plot by Skokov and Shumeyko. Moreover, in  comparison with the first version, it says that a plot is  possible after spring of this year. Well, like the first  version, behind the backs of the plotters lurks the figure of  Prime Minister Viktor Stepanovich Chernomyrdin.    "If one takes the thinking of the authors of the document to  its logical conclusion, an attempt on Yeltsin is being prepared  by the hierarchy of the Cabinet of Ministers, the Federation  Council, the Moscow administration, and a powerful section of  the army leadership, with the well-disposed neutrality of other  power ministries. If one takes these anonymous notes on trust,  then President Yeltsin will clearly remain alone. He will  weaken and try to obtain satisfaction from his last days in the  office of president. Thus, it would be impossible to counter a  powerful alliance of the above-mentioned figures and state  structures. But if not everything in these notes is true --  which is more than probable in view of the complex relations of  the above-mentioned people among themselves and their very  doubtful interest in Yeltsin's removal -- then a whole number of  questions remain. The main one of these: why are anonymous  letters of this kind appearing now?"    Svanidze then turns to Valeriy Zorkin, member of the  Constitutional Court, and asks who he thinks might gain from all  this. Zorkin says he believes it is those who do not reckon  with realities and believe the country can be brought back from  the abyss by junta-type coups. If those who elaborated all this  believe that they can carry out a "palace junta," Zorkin says,  they are sadly disillusioned. Zorkin says he proposes another  "version" where effective power should be linked with national  accord.    Svanidze wonders how real the possibility of a peaceful  outcome of the crisis is and if there can really be accord in  Russia in the foreseeable future. Zorkin believes that the  existing institutions of power must be strengthened and that one  must do everything to make society concentrate around  presidential power, which is the only real capable institution.    Svanidze notes that "all the politicians named in the  documents represent the pragmatic center. Some of these --  Luzhkov, Shumeyko, and Chernomyrdin -- are possible strong  candidates for the president's chair. A most probable task of  their opponents is to cast aspersions on them."    Svanidze asks Zorkin why he decided to become a member of  such movements with the word "accord" in them. Zorkin says  there is nothing strange or odious in joining such movements if  you believe in what they stand for. But this is not what it is  at issue, Zorkin says. It is true there are a number of people  in these movements who may be called centrists, he says. What  we must do is to find a delicate combination between democracy  and authoritarianism on the basis of accord and clearly set-out  rules with a social treaty of the whole people, Zorkin says.    Svanidze notes: "According to an INTERFAX report, Aleksey  Ilyushenko, acting Russian procurator general, today issued an  amendment to a report regarding the intention to carry out a  coup d'etat. According to Ilyushenko, the procuracy general is  prepared to institute criminal proceedings on accusations of  slander in combination with charges of a state crime. Members  of the general procuracy, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and  the federal counterintelligence service will be brought into the  investigation."</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Sevindzh Abdullayeva and Viktor </F> Shulman]    [Text] Baku April 25 TASS -- Three-hour talks between  Turkish Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin and Azeri President Geydar  Aliyev were completed here late at night on Sunday. The meeting  was mostly held behind closed doors.    The talks were focused on the Armenian-Azeri conflict over  the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh enclave and ways for its  settlement. According to the Azeri leader, efforts by  international organizations, including the United Nations, the  CSCE and its Minsk group, failed to produce any positive  results. Seeking to end the protracted warfare by any means,  the republic accepted Russia's mediatory initiatives. However,  all attempts to solve the thorny problem have been in vain so  far. The only obvious thing is that the Armenian side is  forcing Azerbaijan to agree to its terms, which do not meet the  republic's national interests, Aliyev emphasised.    The Turkish foreign minister believes that "the world  community should at last understand clearly that Azerbaijan is  forced to wage war in order to defend its territories." Cetin  dismissed the principle of equal responsibility of both  conflicting sides for the continued fighting, since "aggression  is aimed against Azerbaijan." He pledged that "Turkey would  uphold this position at all international forums."    The Turkish foreign minister told a news conference after  the  talks that "Armenia should meet the demands of U.N. Security  Council resolutions, and to withdraw its troops from occupied  Azeri lands immediately and unconditionally." In case it  continues ignoring these demands, the world community should  impose sanctions upon the republic, Cetin stressed. As for  Turkey, it will not lift the embargo for supplies of foodstuffs  and medicines to Armenia until the republic halts the aggression  against Azerbaijan.    According to the Turkish foreign minister, the current  deadlock in the peace process can be broken by convening a  session of the Minsk conference. However, this is possible only  in case of liberation of Azeri territories. Therefore, Russia,  the United States and other Minsk group countries should step up  their efforts to create conditions for the session to be  convened.    Speaking about deployment of peacekeeping troops in the  conflict zone, Cetin emphasised that "Turkey strongly believes  these can be only international forces, not troops of any  definite country."    The Turkish foreign minister assessed his short-term visit  to  the Azeri capital Baku as "very fruitful." According to his  Azeri counterpart Hasan Hasanov, this visit testified to  Azerbaijan's stable and consistent relations with Turkey, to  which the republic gives top priority in its foreign policy.</p>

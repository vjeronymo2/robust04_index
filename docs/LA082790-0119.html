			<p><P> August 27, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ILLINOIS TRACK ROBBERY A PUZZLE  </P> <P> Officials at Maywood Park Race Track say they still don't know how masked  gunmen found a hidden accounting room at the track, let alone how they robbed  it and got away.  </P> <P> "We're puzzled," Bill Moore, the track's assistant general manager, said  Sunday.  </P> <P> "It is safe to say they had some information because they were able to get in  too smoothly. The source of the information is what puzzles us."  </P> <P> The masked duo took at least $20,000 in cash Saturday from the accounting room,  despite secrecy about its location.  </P> <P> "It appeared they knew where it was. They circumvented a maze of stairs and  doors," said Police Capt. Arthur Jackson. "Employees there for two years often  don't know where accounting is."  </P> <P> The robbery also was timed between betting periods, when few people are around  the grandstands, Jackson said.  </P> <P> Before making off with the cash, the gunmen disarmed a security guard and  disabled three employees with tear gas spray, police said.  </P> <P> None of the victims required hospitalization, Moore said.  </P> <P> It was the first robbery since the track opened in 1946, track President  Patrick Flavin said.  </P></p>

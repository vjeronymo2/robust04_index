Kiridjievska: "There Is No Free Privatization"] </F>   [Text] Will trade in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav  Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] transform itself painlessly or  will it go in the directions it has started -- street trade,  poor-quality goods, and jumbled assortment? These were the  points on which yesterday's debate concentrated, on the subject:  "Transformation of trading companies with state capital," held  in Skopje and organized by the Macedonian Chamber of Commerce  and the Transformation Agency. Besides scientists, it was also  attended by a large number of outstanding economists from the  commercial sphere.    "We wanted to urge another initiative for faster transition,  organization, and ownership restructuring in trade, as the  priority task for the creation of new relations, which should  lead to overcoming the present situation," the introductory  speaker Duse Kotevski, vice president of the Macedonian Chamber  of Commerce, said. While numbering the basic statistical  indications about the real image of the situation in this  economic branch, Kotevski located the roots of the problems in  commerce. He said it was harmful to start liberalization  without adequate solutions and organization, with illegal  activities and disloyal competition. In concluding that the  number of the legal subjects engaged in trade has significantly  increased, he said that the modern shops with rich variety,  catalogue sale, shopping centers, discount shops, and modern  warehouses with terminal cashiers had been replaced by ugly  sights in the streets, whose consequences will be long felt.    According to Ariton Zivkov, professor at the Faculty of  Economics, there was no recipe for the complex process of  transformation, however only those who were really interested in  becoming tradesmen would be able to attain it. In his opinion  this process in trade did not begin with Ante Markovic's law,  but started the moment sales were completed with postponed  payment in conditions of high inflation. One should not forget  the small trading companies supplied themselves from the state  companies by postponing the payment of debts, and sometimes not  paying at all. At the same time, the state sector, according to  Zivkov, had to meet the requirements of the state, contrary to  the private sector, which piled up its capital. Calling this  manner of privatization forced, Professor Zivkov explained he  was doing his best to save resources. In his opinion, there  would be no real transformation in trade without real  efficiency, finance, personnel shifts, selection, and regional  orientation, because trade can drive the economy only if it is  given a chance.    Recalling some clarifications of the law on transformation,  Miroljub Sukarov, manager of the Transformation Agency, said  that priority could be given to nobody. "The process must begin  with the concept of paid privatization, because our country is  not rich, and there is no such thing as free privatization. If  we do not form a body of financial resources, the social  tensions will not be prevented, and the state must have money to  maintain social peace. The law on transformation divides the  companies into those that have, and those that have not started  privatization, and it has to end in a period of two years."  These were the words of professor Aleksandar Nikolovski from  the Faculty of Economics. We must not wait and play tactics in  transforming ourselves, because we are getting close to a deeper  abyss.    Bobek Suklev, professor at the Economics Faculty  provocatively started his discussion by saying, "I shall start  my job by giving assessments with the question of whether the  company is yours, that is, whether you can prove it is your  property. From previous experience I know that companies do not  have such proof at their disposal and that will slow down the  process of privatization. Thus, the assessment will have to be  based on experience, on the feeling for each particular  situation, and on the basis of a subjective evaluation."    Joining the discussion, the economists showed interest in  the  fate of the shareholders' capital, the prohibition on selling  objects with a value of over 50,000 German marks, as well as in  putting a mortgage on objects when there is no capital turnover.  They stated that it would be a great and unforgiving sin if this  state took liquidation as the only prospect for the former state  industry, but that would be inevitable if four conditions were  not fulfilled. They are: a rigorous decrease in the gray  economy, equal working conditions, an alteration to the Law on  office space, computerization, but also a true division between  the private and the state sectors.  <H5>  [Box, p 3] </H5> <H5>  Seminar on Privatization </H5>   Today and tomorrow a seminar will be held at the Faculty of  Law with privatization as the subject. There will be 12  lecturers, nine of which are eminent professors of the Faculty  of Law, and three are professors of the Faculty of Economics.  Jane Miljovski, minister in the Macedonian Government, and  Sofia Todorova, Minister of Development, will also present their  views. The discussions will be concentrated on the  privatization of state companies with 100 percent state capital  that have not yet started the process of transformation  according to the old laws.    -- by V.C.</p>

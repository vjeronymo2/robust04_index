			<p><P> February 19, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MARTIN LUTHER KING AND I;  </P> <P> CONTROVERSY: SAYING A NEW BOOK IMPLIES A LIAISON, THE WOMAN WHO SERVED THE  CIVIL RIGHTS LEADER HIS LAST DINNER, FILES SUIT TO CLEAR HER NAME.  </P> <P> Adjua Abi Naantaanbuu, a graceful woman with languid eyes and pointed wit,  sipped tea and talked about that day more than 20 years ago, the day the Rev.  Martin Luther King Jr. died. It was 1968 and he had had dinner at her house the  night before. Those events changed her life.  </P> <P> "I knew something was wrong" in America if a man as revered as King could be  murdered for his color and his nonviolent beliefs, she told a visitor to her  home in a quiet Memphis neighborhood, the same one in which she was host to  King.  </P> <P> Naantaanbuu, who in 1968 was Tarlease Mathews, began "embracing the African  culture and being proud of who I am." Now, she says, the only "European  clothes" she owns are jogging outfits. All the rest are African, like the long,  loose purple and white dress, with matching gele that she wore on a recent day.  </P> <P> She produces an annual African-American cultural festival in Memphis. At 53,  she has carved out her niche in this city.  </P> <P> But another incident connected to King has come along, again altering her life  dramatically.  </P> <P> The Rev. Ralph Abernathy, in his recently published book, "And the Walls Came  Tumbling Down," described that last dinner at Naantaanbuu's house, and, without  naming her, called her "a 'friend' of" King.  </P> <P> She "had provided dinner partners" for King and another activist, Bernard Lee,  that night, Abernathy wrote. And, he wrote that, sometime after dinner, "Martin  and his friend came out of the bedroom."  </P> <P> The implication was clear -- that King was an adulterer on his last night  alive, with his closest aide a near witness.  </P> <P> That account, published in October, infuriated black people generally, but in  Naantaanbuu's view, it amounted to libel. She has sued Abernathy, his  publisher, Harper &amp; Row, and the book's editor, Daniel Bial, seeking a  total of $10 million -- $5 million from Abernathy, $2.5 million each from the  publisher and editor. And she wants a stop-publish order on any books  containing what her 10-page complaint calls "the defamatory material."  </P> <P> Abernathy did not return repeated telephone calls, but in past interviews he  has stood by his account.  </P> <P> In a statement released Friday, Harper &amp; Row officials said that the  company "has complete confidence in this book and in the integrity and veracity  of its author. We believe the lawsuit is without merit, and we will defend it  aggressively."  </P> <P> Abernathy's account is "a lie," Naantaanbuu said, holding a well-worn copy of  the book, asserting that Abernathy makes her out to be "a madam."  </P> <P> In more than three hours of conversation, Naantaanbuu gave her own account of  King's last night alive, including his comments about the likelihood he would  be murdered and his threat to leave the civil rights movement. She compared her  feelings about King and Malcolm X, whose philosophy she finds more appealing.  </P> <P> Naantaanbuu and her attorney reject the notion that the lawsuit, filed in New  York earlier this month, weakens the civil rights movement, and Naantaanbuu  asserts that her own faith in "the movement" remains unshaken.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, Naantaanbuu said that Abernathy's book has taken a terrible toll  on her. Stress has caused her to gain 30 pounds, she said. Strangers stop and  stare. And the talk tears her apart. "I have a friend who said that a lady told  her: 'She's no different from Jessica Hahn,' " (the one-time church secretary  with whom the Rev. Jim Bakker had a sexual encounter before his television  evangelical empire crumbled).  </P> <P> "It's so depressing to have to deal with something like this," she said. "My  reputation is on the line. I walk out in the street, and people look at me and  you can see all eyes going (here, she rolls her eyes). They're saying, 'That's  the woman that Abernathy said was coming out of the bedroom.' Well, think what  they read into that -- coming out of the bedroom, you know? It's a very ugly,  nasty thing."  </P> <P> In many ways, Naantaanbuu's story illustrates how any person can go from  obscurity to notoriety in the stroke of a computer key.  </P> <P> Naantaanbuu was asleep one night last October when the first friend telephoned  her to tell her that she had joined the notorious.  </P> <P> "I've got something important to tell you," the friend said, citing news  reports. "Abernathy has written a book. And . . . he talked about them being at  your home and seeing you and Dr. King coming out of your bedroom."  </P> <P> Naantaanbuu recalls responding, "Oh, you gotta be kidding."  </P> <P> She said: "I just couldn't imagine Abernathy having something like that printed  when it wasn't true."  </P> <P> Naantaanbuu and Abernathy agree on much of what happened on the night of April  3. Their major differences center on two paragraphs on Page 434 of the book,  rapidly becoming known as the "$10-million paragraphs."  </P> <P> In the first paragraph, Abernathy wrote that King's "friend" invited the three  men over for dinner and that when they arrived, "we found three ladies  waiting." He went on to describe a "heavy meal along with some light  conversation." In the other paragraph, Abernathy wrote that he was exhausted,  fell asleep in an easy chair in the living room and awoke as "Martin and his  friend came out of the bedroom."  </P> <P> As Naantaanbuu tells it, she had never met King before she was "volunteered" by  local rights activists to chauffeur him, along with Abernathy, Jesse Jackson  and Bernard Lee, from the Memphis airport to the Lorraine Motel. The group was  coming to town to lend support to striking garbage workers.  </P> <P> She recalls picking up the four men in her car, "a large car, a deuce and a  quarter," as the fancy Buick 225 was called then. After the men checked into  the motel -- the same one on whose balcony King would be shot to death the next  day -- Naantaanbuu delivered them to a church meeting. After the meeting she  delivered three of them -- Jackson rode off in a limousine and was not at the  dinner -- back to the motel, where Abernathy "asked me if I would prepare some  food for them."  </P> <P> He also asked her to supply some liquor, she said, which she did, asserting  that Abernathy drank liberally from the fifth of gin. (Abernathy's account does  not mention any alcohol being served at the dinner.)  </P> <P> Excited at the prospect of having King and his colleagues as dinner guests,  Naantaanbuu said she phoned her sister, Cleopra Mitchell; a woman friend, Marie  Jones, and several other people and told them that "Dr. King was coming over to  my house," and invited them to drop by.  </P> <P> The meal -- steak, potatoes, salad -- would be eaten after King delivered his  stirring, prophetic "I've been to the mountaintop" speech to the striking  garbage workers, in which he thundered: "Like anybody, I would like to live a  long life. Longevity has its place. But I'm not concerned about that now. I  just want to do God's will. . . . And so I'm happy tonight. I'm not worried  about anything. I'm not fearing any man. Mine eyes have seen the glory of the  coming of the Lord."  </P> <P> Still high after the electrifying rally, the group -- Naantaanbuu, King,  Abernathy, Lee, Mitchell and Jones -- ate about midnight, Naantaanbuu said.  Jones left about 1:30 and the rest of them stayed and talked until 2:45 a.m.,  she said, noting that Abernathy was nodding off in the living room while King  talked.  </P> <P> Abernathy, not King, Naantaanbuu said, went to lie on her bed. "He had had too  much to drink," she said.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, she said, King talked as if he "knew he wasn't going to be around  long," recalling a conversation with Robert Kennedy in which both men predicted  their murders.  </P> <P> At one point, she said, King said he had thought of quitting the movement,  saying that once when colleagues came to his house in Atlanta, "he said he sent  his wife to the door to tell them that he wasn't there. He said at that point  he had decided to get out."  </P> <P> At no time, Naantaanbuu said, did she and King become intimate.  </P> <P> "It would have been highly unethical," she said, fuming, "to pull somebody off  to my bedroom, you know, especially somebody I'd never met before. The whole  thing is just terrible." Mitchell and Jones plan to testify for her during the  trial, Naantaanbuu said.  </P> <P> Naantaanbuu views her plight as ironic, having her life turned upside down  because she played the "good Samaritan" to King, especially since she considers  her temperament closer to Malcolm X's -- the charismatic black nationalist who  was murdered in 1965 -- than to King's.  </P> <P> She said that although she admired King's nonviolent approach to civil rights,  turning the other cheek is not her style.  </P> <P> "Malcolm is the kind of brother I admire very much," Naantaanbuu said,  gesturing toward a copy of his autobiography, which occupies a prominent place  on her bookshelf. She is fond of telling the story of meeting Malcolm at a 1963  Mississippi protest, where he lent moral support but refused to join the  demonstration because, as she reported his saying, "If those (people) spit on  him or kicked him, he was going to die in Mississippi."  </P> <P> "I believe in loving those who love you," said Naantaanbuu. "Fight those who  fight you. That is my philosophy. Same as Malcolm's."  </P> <P> It was not always that way. She said her grandfather was a minister, "and I was  in church everytime the door opened." She later came to believe that it was  wrong to "be meek and humble and believe the Lord will open up the window of  heaven and pour out your blessings."  </P> <P> The coming battle against Abernathy fits Naantaanbuu's style. Her attorney,  Gail Boyd, who practices in New York City, portrayed the suit as a necessary  response -- regardless of the fallout.  </P> <P> "When the shot has been fired from the opposing camp," she said, "you have to  fire back."  </P> <P> As the case winds its way through the court system -- Naantaanbuu is seeking a  jury trial, and pretrial proceedings are scheduled for April 20 -- Naantaanbuu  continues her effort to spread Pan-Africanism.  </P> <P> She is partial to large gold earrings and a nose ring, along with a necklace  bearing a gold African pendant. A wall in her home is filled with books and  artifacts extolling African and black American culture.  </P> <P> A barber and beautician, Naantaanbuu is separated from her husband. She is the  mother of three children, aged 34, 26 and 16, and has extended her family by  creating a program for children who are enrolled in a local Head Start program,  aimed at familiarizing the 3- to 5-year-olds with black culture and heroes,  African and American.  </P> <P> On a recent day, 22 youngsters sat in a circle at a Head Start center, and one  by one, they stood, greeting the group in Swahili, then introducing themselves,  taking on names of famous black people. There was a little King, a Frederick  Douglass, a Cleopatra, a Nat Turner, an Angela Davis, a Jomo Kenyatta, a Cicely  Tyson. And Malcolm X was there.  </P> <P> After an hour, Naantaanbuu, asked: "How many of you all know the movement song,  'We Shall Overcome?' " Most of the little hands shot up, and a minute later,  they were all singing, led by Naantaanbuu.  </P> <P> Back at home, Naantaanbuu is reflective.  </P> <P> No, the stress has not worn her all the way down. The episode, she says,  "increases my determination to educate the sisters and brothers because Ralph  Abernathy is an unconscious brother."  </P> <P> No, she has not talked with Abernathy, whom she once considered a friend, since  the book was published.  </P> <P> And, yes, sometimes she has second thoughts about having filed the suit because  "I was just not prepared for the kinds of changes I have had to go through as a  result of this."  </P> <P> But, she goes on, "I've been damaged. My reputation -- I'll always have that  stigma that will follow me all the days of my life. If I win, they'll say that  there was the woman that Abernathy said . . . " her voice trails off. "And if I  lose in court, '(people will say) that's the woman that slept with King.'  That'll always be. I mean, regardless of what happens, that'll always be."  </P></p>

			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / Arts: Henry V - Theatre The Royal Shakespeare Company is giving itself a large transfusion of new blood this season. For its first new production in Stratford's big Royal Shakespeare Theatre, Henry V, the director (Matthew Warchus), designer (Neil Warmington) and lead actor (Iain Glen) are all new to the company; so are over half the cast. Warchus, who staged last summer's odd and fresh West End Much Ado, gives us a Henry V less odd and just as fresh. The opening image is a study in scarlet: the medieval royal robes hanging above a field of poppies. The modern-dress Chorus (Tony Britton) wears a Remembrance-Sunday poppy in his coat, and Henry V (Iain Glen) puts on the royal red during his first scene. The connection of kingship and bloodshed is explicit, as is the contrast between time present and time past. Visually, the Agincourt scenes have immense, multi-faceted eloquence. While the battle rages - on a ramp centre-stage, before an azure sky - hooded bystanders plant poppies on the margins of the stage; and disparate pieces of armour, like severed limbs, descend and hang eerily in the air. At the end of Act Five - before the spreading cornfields and mountains of France - the stage action freezes, just as Catherine signs the marriage contract; while, from the sides, the Chorus comes forward to draw the play to a close. Iain Glen, as the young King, has star quality. He looks and sounds noble, intelligent, virile, sensitive, appealing, handsome. He arrives with strong Shakespearian credentials (having won awards for his Glasgow Macbeth and Bristol Hamlet; he played Edgar at the Royal Court and in the recent Gielgud/Branagh recording). He brings to Henry a very interesting nervous intensity, and he develops - maturing vocally from high, clear tenor to shadowed baritone - from cautious cool to tempered assurance. However, he has as yet no stillness. Even when praying to God before the battle, he employs so restless a variety of inflection that his actual words hardly strike home. But Glen's potential is obviously vast. His sheer nobility is something rare on our stages, and the way it is combined with intensity, attack, variety, is rarer. The contrast between Glen's Henry and Britton's Chorus - between warrior and mourner, action and recollection - is excellent. Spruce, silver-haired, his voice full-toned, he does rather too much. There are some uneconomical gestures with his walking-stick, and consciously 'poetic' vocal effects. But he is both authoritative and detached. Of the other players, two of the youngest made an especially sure impression  -Daniel Evans as the Boy (Welsh); and Julia Crane as a bespectacled attendant at the French court. Elsewhere Warchus has not brought out all the characters' human complexity. But Linal Haft, though he sometimes reduces Fluellyn to a comic turn, is generally fine and funny. Monica Dolan, as Catherine of France, plays her charming scenes with an unusually keen energy. In repertory at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon, until January</p>

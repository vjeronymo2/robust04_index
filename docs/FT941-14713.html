			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / Arts: Power shift becomes Oleanna - Theatre A spectacular change of cast makes David Mamet's Oleanna look an even better play than when it had its British premiere at the Royal Court last July. There can be no higher praise than that. The principal talent still lies in the writing. Nothing in Mamet's text is redundant. The lines are short and frequently, but never pointlessly, interrupted. Here are two characters - a male professor and a not very bright female student - failing to understand each other. With the new cast there is a change in the balance of power. There is an additional gain. The juxtaposition of the student's sense of social inferiority and the professor's relative affluence, self-confidence and security has become much clearer. When I first saw Harold Pinter's production at the Court, I noted that it was about much more than the current debate on political correctness. It was about McCarthyism, liberalism and academic freedom over the ages. I wrote, perhaps wrongly, that the gender clash was incidental to the theme: the student might just as well have been male. Now I am not so sure, for the great merit of Oleanna is that it can be played in all sorts of ways. Here the social side is much stronger. The student has worked hard to get to college in the first place, and is probably the first member of her family to have done so. She has read the professor's book in order to write her essay. True, she doesn't understand it, but she expects to be taught and given the rewards of a university education. What she sees is a professor who seems at least as interested in buying a new house and securing his tenure as teaching his subject. Moreover, he has troubles with his wife and his telephone scarcely stops ringing. It does so, almost fatally at the end of the first act when the student is just beginning to become articulate. By the start of act two, there has been a complete reversal of roles. The girl has been to her campus committee and is pursuing a case against the professor not only for sexual harassment, but also for relying on unacceptable texts. The student's perceptions are, of course, a travesty of the truth. The professor is going out of his way to help her. Nevertheless, at her age and with her background, it is the perceptions that count, and he does in a way seem slightly smug and patronising. None of that was so plain when the play first appeared. Not for the first time I think that Pinter's direction has improved with repeated performances. The timing of the lines - and the interruptions - has become immaculate. Just as important, the new cast is more fitted to the roles and thus allow greater scope for ambiguity about who is more at fault. In the original production David Suchet was a rather diffident professor who would never hurt a fly except under extreme provocation. He tended to go round apologising for himself. He has been succeeded by Denis Lawson. No-one would use the word diffident about him. Lawson is tall, dark and handsome with blow-dryed hair, oozes charm and knows it. All that makes the perception of a sexual advance more plausible. Again, in the original version the student as played by Lia Williams was a mousy, reticent figure who seemed to have been put up to her complaints by the campus committee. Michelle Fairley is quite different. She seems to be acting in her own right. Sometimes in the second act she seems frightening, not because she is a timid girl who has been frightened into assertiveness, but because she is genuinely frightening and believes what she is saying. Note the sting in the way she seeks to turn the tables on the professor when making a (quite false) distinction between allegations and facts. None of that is to cast aspersions on the earlier performers. It is a tribute to the play and the production. No doubt another team could play it another way again, and one hopes that will happen. Here, in the gender war, Lawson and Fairley come out on pretty well equal terms. But that is only my impression. Oleanna is so good precisely because others can reach different conclusions.

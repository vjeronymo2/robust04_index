			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / International Company News: Continental 'satisfactory' if market conditions hold CONTINENTAL, the German tyre manufacturer, is on course for 'satisfactory' results this year provided there is no deterioration in market conditions later this year, the chief executive said yesterday. Mr Hubertus von Grunberg told shareholders in Hanover that the group managed to make a profit in the first five months of the year although sales fell by 10 per cent to DM3.7bn (Dollars 2.18bn). Mr von Grunberg blamed the decline in turnover on low unit sales to the recession-hit car industry, but cited a number of factors which were working in the group's favour. These include a continued recovery in earnings at General Tire, the group's US subsidiary, as well as the swift implementation of rationalisation measures which had enabled the group to avoid the full force of the downturn. These measures would be intensified during the rest of the year. Mr von Grunberg said Continental was considering transferring production away from high cost manufacturing sites in western Europe to other parts of the world. Continental made net profits of DM133m last year after a loss of DM128.2m in 1991. The recovery disguises poor conditions in the second half of last year when the group made virtually no profit. Mr von Grunberg earlier this year described the first two months of 1993 as 'miserable'.</p>

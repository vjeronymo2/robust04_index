			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / US and N Korea climb back in the ring: Resumption of talks today in Geneva on nuclear issue The US and North Korea will resume high-level talks in Geneva today on full inspections of Pyongyang's nuclear programme in return for possible US diplomatic ties and economic aid. However, new uncertainties will cloud the negotiations, , suspended on July 8 after only one day because of the death of North Korea's President Kim Il-sung. The main question is whether North Korea has changed its basic policy on the nuclear issue under its new leader, Mr Kim Jong-il, the late president's son. The talks are expected provide the first significant indication of Mr Kim's willingness to solve the nuclear dispute and proceed with economic reforms opening the country to foreign investment. 'Our policy remains consistent,' said Mr Ho Jong, former North Korean ambassador to the United Nations and a member of the Geneva delegation led by Mr Kang Sok-ju, the first vice foreign minister. But there is still concern that Mr Kim may adopt a hard line in order to win the backing of military for his assumption of power which has not yet been completed. Moreover, the one month delay in the talks occasioned by the president's death has increased pressure to find a quick solution. North Korea has threatened to start reprocessing spent nuclear fuel into weapons-grade plutonium at the end of the month if an accord is not achieved soon. Pyongyang claims that the spent fuel rods, which are being stored in a cooling tank under the supervision of the International Atomic Energy Agency, must be reprocessed soon for safety reasons. But the reprocessing of the fuel, which could produce plutonium for four or five nuclear bombs, would break North Korea's promise to freeze its nuclear activities. The US has threatened to break off the talks in response and seek UN economic sanctions, an action Pyongyang has said amounts to an act of war. The US has disputed the urgency of reprocessing the spent fuel rods, believing that North Korea is using the issue as a negotiating tactic. Mr Robert Gallucci, US assistant secretary of state and chief US delegate at the Geneva talks, said: 'The first order of business for us with the (North Korean) representatives on Friday will be to address that issue of time and push it aside for a number of months.' The US has suggested that North Korea transport the nuclear fuel to a third country for processing, but Pyongyang opposes the idea. Washington appears willing to grant several concessions to North Korea if it agrees to full nuclear inspections. These could include the establishment of liaison offices as a first step to full diplomatic relations, which Pyongyang regards as a guarantee of US non-aggression. It has also suggested that it would support the replacement of North Korea's plutonium-producing graphite reactors with safer light water ones that would be supplied by Russia, Japan or South Korea at a cost of at least Dollars 1bn. Several other problems remain in concluding a comprehensive agreement, including procedural issues on how actions by both sides would be co-ordinated. North Korea is also refusing a demand by the International Atomic Energy Agency to be allowed to make special inspections of two suspected nuclear waste dump sites to determine if Pyongyang has previously withdrawn plutonium from its 5MW reactor to make at least one nuclear bomb. The US has stipulated that North Korea must accept the special inspections in return for concessions. The IAEA request triggered the nuclear dispute 16 months ago, prompting North Korea to threaten to withdraw from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. Another potential source of trouble is the expected US insistence that diplomatic ties between Washington and Pyongyang be linked to progress on relations between North and South Korea. A proposed summit between the two Koreas was postponed following President Kim's death and tensions have increased in recent weeks as the two countries have engaged in a fierce propaganda war. The linkage between North-South Korean relations and US-North Korea ties is meant to prevent Pyongyang from using the nuclear issue to drive a wedge between Washington and Seoul over the future defence of South Korea. Pyongyang has repeatedly claimed that the solution to the nuclear dispute lies in an agreement with the US, since it regards South Korea as being an American 'puppet state'.</p>

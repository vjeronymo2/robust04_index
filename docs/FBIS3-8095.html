			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by B.I.W.: "Solidarity Announces Surprise Strikes"] </F>   [Text] The first strike, a strike of railway workers  lasting at least 10 days, is supposed to be one of the "more  cumbersome" for the people," the "Solidarity" ["S"] leadership  admitted during a Thursday [3 March] press conference.    Passenger trains will be stopped for one day. When will that  be? We will find out from the posters at railway stations. At  any rate, "on Monday [7 March] people can still travel by  train," said Railway "S" head Krzysztof Maminski. A few days  following this strike, there is supposed to be "a long strike,  blocking freight traffic and thus paralyzing the economy, but it  will not be cumbersome to the people."    "S" merely says that the strike action will be conducted by  the plants of the metal branch, energy, mining, communications,  and railways, as well as selected regions, districts, and  enterprises. "S" will not reveal who will go on strike, when,  and for how long. It is going to reveal the details no more than  10 hours before the strikes actually begin because "all of the  things that have been practiced on the union before are starting  all over again." "Traveling all over the country are gentlemen  with attache cases who put out strikes and promise wonders,"  said National Committee Spokesman Piotr Zak.    Asked whether the people will bear the costs of the "S"  action, Zak gave assurances that, even though "strikes are  always cumbersome," they will try to "limit this  cumbersomeness": "One can, for example, imagine limiting energy  supplies not to private houses and apartments but only to  offices...."    "Will the central administration be paralyzed?" journalists  asked.    "Now, has it not been paralyzed already?" replied "S" Head  Marian Krzaklewski.    Miners are planning three forms of the strike: They will not  go underground; they will, but they will not work, or they will  work, but they will not sell the coal. "The purpose of our  strike is not to overthrow the government or this political  configuration," said Silesian "S" Head Marek Kempski.    On 7 March, the "S" action is supposed to begin with a  collection of money for the strikers. Not only "S" members but  all of the people participating in the strike will be entitled  to remuneration for the strike.    Asked whether the trade union is strong enough to undertake  such a large-scale action, Krzaklewski replied that "all of the  structures in Poland are going through an organizational crisis;  however, in comparison with others, we are effective; hence the  fight with the union." He also evaluated that the determination  of the work force is so great that, "if our union and each plant  had a strike fund, they would all go on strike."    He is not afraid of chaos. "I am afraid of a 200,000-person  demonstration in Warsaw. I would not like the people to go out  on the streets; therefore, I prefer that they protest in their  plants," said Krzaklewski.    "S" will not conclude any branch or regional agreement, if  talks on all-national demands of the entire union are not held.  Neither will it respect any agreement signed by the union, if  it does not include the all-national demands. Krzaklewski added  that, since November 1992, the union had been in collective  bargaining with the government, concerning compensation for the  costs of living; Silesia demanded that in its strike, and now  "S" has the full right to go on a general strike. "This time we  will complete our action when decisions, not paperwork  agreements, are made."    The Cegielski Factory in Poznan will not take part in the  "S"  strike. Marek Lenartowski, head of the plant "S," which belongs  to the "Network," said that "a strike will pour oil on the  flames," and the planned action is "an ambition-dictated  activity of the chairman and the union leadership."</p>

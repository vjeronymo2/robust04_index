			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 45. One comment asked FDA to define ``relevant'' for proposed &sect;314.94(a)(12)(ii). The word ``relevant'' refers to those patents defined by section 505(j)(2)(A)(vii) of the act for which a patent certification would be required, i.e., patents that claim the listed drug, or drug substance component thereof, referred to in the ANDA or that claim a use of the listed drug or drug substance for which the ANDA applicant seeks approval and for which patent information is required to be filed under section 505 (b) and (c) of the act and &sect;314.53.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although patents that are held to be invalid or unenforceable in a judicial decision may be removed from the list by FDA, a patent that has been declared invalid or unenforceable in a lawsuit resulting in 180-day exclusivity will be deemed relevant under &sect;314.94(a)(12)(ii) and will not be removed from the list until the end of the 180-day exclusivity period. This will ensure that 180-day exclusivity cannot be avoided by changing a patent certification.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 46. Several comments objected to proposed &sect;314.94(a)(12)(iii), which would require ANDA applicants to provide a patent statement if the listed patent is for a method of use and that applicant does not intend to claim any of the patented uses. The comments recommended that such ANDA applicants certify, under &sect;314.94(a)(12)(i)(A)( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), that the listed use patent would not be infringed, thereby giving the patent owner notice of possible patent infringement. One comment asked how proposed &sect;314.94(a)(12)(iii) would affect eligibility for the 180-day exclusivity period. The comment explained that the statute requires ANDA applicants to make patent certifications under section 505(j)(2)(A)(vii) of the act and statements for method of use patents under section 505(j)(2)(A)(viii) of the act. However, the comment stated, for method of use patents, the proposed rule could be interpreted as giving ANDA applicants the option of making a patent certification of noninfringement under proposed &sect;314.94(a)(12)(i)(A)( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) or a statement that the applicants' drug products do not involve a patented claim under proposed &sect;314.94(a)(12)(iii).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA does not intend &sect;314.94(a)(12)(i)(A)( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) to authorize certifications with respect to patents that claim a use for the listed drug for which the applicant is not seeking approval. The statute requires patent certifications only if the patent ``claims a use for [the] listed drug for which the applicant is seeking approval *&blank;*&blank;*'' (section 505(j)(2)(A)(vii) of the act). The statute requires an applicant to make a patent statement when a method of use patent ``does not claim a use for which the applicant is seeking approval *&blank;*&blank;*'' (section 505(j)(2)(A)(viii) of the act).) The proposed rule recognized this distinction. FDA stated that if a patent claims a method of using the listed drug, and labeling for the ANDA applicant's proposed drug product does not contain any indications covered by the method of use patent, the ANDA applicant ``should not submit a certification under &sect;314.94(a)(12)(i)(A) for such a patent'' (54 FR 28872 at 28886). The preamble also indicated that if the labeling for the ANDA applicant's product did contain an indication that was claimed by a patent, the applicant should make a certification under &sect;314.94(a)(12)(i)(A). (Id.) Thus, the two provisions cited by the comment are not overlapping, and an applicant does not have the option of making a certification under &sect;314.94(a)(12)(i)(A)( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) in lieu of, or in addition to, a statement under &sect;314.94(a)(12)(iii).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If, however, there are listed patents that present both a product and method of use claim, the applicant may file a paragraph IV certification with respect to the product patent or patent claim and a statement that the product that is the subject of the application does not involve a patented method of use with respect to the method of use patent or patent claim.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 47. One comment recommended revising proposed &sect;314.94(a)(12)(v) to provide NDA holders the opportunity to consent to licensing agreements between ANDA applicants and patent owners. As written, proposed &sect;314.94(a)(12)(v) did not address this issue.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Neither the statute nor the legislative history suggests that NDA holders should be given such a right, and the agency is not prepared to infer such a right to interfere in the patent holder's enjoyment of its right to license. However, as stated earlier, FDA has elected to remove the language in &sect;314.94(a)(12)(v) regarding consent by the patent owner.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

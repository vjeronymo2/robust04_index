			<p><P> January 28, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THEY FULLY ENJOYED SEINFELD SHOW  </P> <P> In response to Lawrence Christon's review of Jerry Seinfeld's performance  ("Laughing on Empty," Calendar, Jan. 17), we feel he was very unfair to this  talented comedian, not just in the review of the show but also in the attack on  Seinfeld's person -- "the New York face, thin as a chisel." (We are not from  New York.)  </P> <P> The next time Mr. Seinfeld appears in Orange County, perhaps this critic could  take a sense of humor instead of pen and relax and enjoy the show.  </P> <P> Mr. &amp; Mrs. RUSSELL G. GORDON  </P> <P> Huntington Beach  </P></p>

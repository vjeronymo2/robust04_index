This was confirmed by the Defense Ministry.  However, the question arises, how the possible arms sale to  Turkey can be reconciled with the new arms law.    Two weeks ago, officers from the Turkish Army visited the  depot at Zonhoven, where the excess equipment is stacked up in a  big shed, waiting for potential buyers. Last Friday 11 March],  the Turkish military also paid a visit to Lombardsijde, where  another battery is stored. They asked about the price, and  requested that Belgians train the Turkish military in operating  the antiaircraft guns. So far, it is merely an exchange of  information. This was confirmed to DE MORGEN yesterday by the  Defense Ministry, which also stated that it is now waiting for  the Turks to decide whether they will actually buy the Hawk  batteries. However, there seem to be no other potential buyers.    The Hawk batteries come from two Belgian battalions in  Germany which were shut down. Their arms were dismantled and  transported to Belgium.    The deal involves a total of four batteries in Zonhoven and  one battery in Lombardsijde. Each battery is equipped with  three launching mounts and with tracking and detection radars.  They include some 300 short- and medium-range missiles. When  the Belgian army purchased the equipment in the sixties, it had  paid several billions of francs for it. Throughout the years,  the equipment was gradually automated.    The news about the Turkish interest in Belgian Army  equipment  was circulating at last weekend's International Kurdish  Conference in Brussels. In the corridors, participants said it  was an outrage that Belgium is selling equipment to a country  which is fighting a civil war with the Kurds -- even though  Turkey is a member of NATO.  <H5>  Arms law </H5>   One might, indeed, wonder whether the arms sale to Turkey  can  be reconciled with the letter and spirit of the new Belgian arms  law. The law -- a consequence of the painful arms crisis which  toppled the Martens VIII government in 1991 -- has been in force  since April 1993. Article 4 lists the criteria by which an  export permit can be refused. Such a refusal is possible if the  export "is seriously contrary to Belgium's external interests or  to the international goals pursued by Belgium, especially if it  would contribute to a manifest violation of human rights."    So far, there is no problem, since the Hawk missiles can  only  be used to shoot down airplanes. The Kurds -- with whom the  Turks are fighting a bitter war -- have no airplanes.    Things change when one looks at the section in Article 4  which states that arms exports are forbidden if "the country of  destination is faced with heavy internal tensions which might  lead to an armed conflict (or if the country) is involved in a  civil war...." This is definitely the case in Turkey.    In 1992, there was already a lot of fuss about the selling  of  AIFV armored vehicles from Cockerill Mechanics Industries to  Turkey. The arms law was not in force then. Later, Kurdish  spokesmen claimed that the AIFV's were used as mobile police  stations. At present, they are reportedly used to encircle  villages, in anticipation of the Air Force's arrival. At the  time, the European Community refused to impose an arms embargo  on Turkey, in exchange for (idle) Turkish promises that human  rights would be respected.    So the sale of Belgian arms to other countries continues to  create a great deal of turmoil. Last week, several Flemish  peace organizations protested against the planned sale of Mirage  fighter planes to Chile. They are especially displeased fact  that former Chilean dictator Pinochet still controls the South  American country's army.    Yesterday, AGALEV (Green Party) demanded that the government  be accountable to parliament for the Army selling weapons on its  own, or for authorizing arms exports in general. The Greens  endorsed the peace movement's protest. "Safe transactions are  impossible," they argue, "because the arms can be easily misused  in internal or regional conflicts."    "No one knows the Belgian arms' final destination after the  official sale, or their potential side effects," AGALEV said in  a statement.</p>

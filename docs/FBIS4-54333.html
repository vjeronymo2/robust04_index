			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 27 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam  said Friday his visit to Russia starting June 1 is part of  Seoul's summit diplomacy to establish genuine peace on the  Korean peninsula through "quadruple diplomacy."    Visiting an Air Force fighter wing, he stressed that the  Armed Forces can exert all their strength only after winning the  people's confidence. Accompanying the Armed Forces'  commander-in-chief on his visit to the Air Force unit just four  days before his state trip to Russia were Defense Minister Yi  Pyong-tae, Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Yi Yang-ho,  Senior Presidential Secretary for Foreign Affairs and Security  Chong Chong-uk and Presidential Spokesman Chu Ton-sik, among  others. Arriving at the wing headquarters, the president was met  by Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Kim Hong-nae.    After the wing commander gave a briefing on his missions,  Kim  emphasized the Air Force's importance to national defense,  exhorting both the officers and men to do their utmost in  discharging their duties.    Explaining about North Korea's severe food and oil shortages  and corruption in officialdom, he said, "This is a very  dangerous time... I know how important a role the Air Force  played and how strong a power it exerted in the Gulf war... I  trust you all."    While touring a room for stand-by pilots, he personally  pushed the scramble bell to see how fast the pilots could take  off and then observed a display by F-5E fighters and Apache  helicopters. Visiting the wing's maintenance shop, he presented  a watch to the shop manager.    From the Air Force wing, he boarded a helicopter and flew to  an Army infantry division on the central front line to check the  division's troops deployed along the front, guided by Army Chief  of Staff Gen. Kim Tong-chin.    After the Army division, he visited a Naval fleet  headquarters to inspect the fleet, guided by Chief of Naval  Operations Adm. Kim Hong-yol. After planting a tree in the  headquarters compound, President Kim went on board the  "Kyongbuk" and posed with sailors for a photograph, then lunched  with them in the ship's mess hall.</p>

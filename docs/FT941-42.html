			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / International Company News: Union Miniere may return to profit this year Union Miniere, the Belgian mining and metals group, expects earnings to improve strongly this year after reporting a slightly reduced net loss for 1993. Mr Jean-Pierre Rodier, chief executive, said UM might return to a net profit this year. The board, however, did not think it appropriate to pay a dividend for 1993. UM last paid a dividend in 1990. The group suffered a net loss after minority interests of BFr2.484bn (Dollars 69m) in 1993, against a loss of BFr2.814bn the previous year. Mr Rodier said UM achieved a BFr160m operating profit in a year when most metal prices plummeted. This hit most of its processing operations. The 1992 operating result of BFr1.93bn included BFr1bn non-recurring gains on stocks. UM managed to stay on course partly because of rationalisation measures and partly because of strong performances at the processing units. He said UM expected to collect BFr9bn cash in May from its policy of selling non-strategic assets to fund investment in the core business. UM's turnover fell to BFr105.2bn from BFr120.8bn.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Most researchers consider DDE-caused eggshell thinning to be the proximate factor that caused peregrine falcon populations to decline in North America. Average eggshell thickness decreased by as much as 24 percent in Alaska during the peak period of organochlorine contamination. This decreased eggshell thickness correlated with greatly reduced reproductive success. Eggshell thickness has increased significantly since the use of DDT was restricted in the United States, but pesticides accumulated in Latin America still affect shell thickness. Shells from Rankin Inlet, NWT, collected in 1981&hyph;1986 averaged 15.8 percent thinner than pre-DDT shells (Court  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . 1990). Alaskan shells collected in 1979&hyph;1984 averaged 13.4 percent thinner than pre-DDT thickness measurements, and shells collected in 1988&hyph;1991 averaged about 12 percent thinner. Peregrine populations are expected to decrease in size if eggs have shells averaging at least 17 percent thinner than normal while populations with eggs averaging less than 17 percent thinning generally remain stable or can increase in size (Kiff 1988). Although arctic peregrine falcon eggs remain vulnerable to an increase in exposure to organochlorines, eggshell thinning has been insufficient to prevent widespread population recovery since the late 1970's.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Reproductive success is another parameter used in measuring the effects of pesticide poisoning upon peregrine falcons. ``Normal'' productivity rates vary among regions; therefore, it is difficult to assess the health of a local population based upon productivity rate alone. In Alaska, productivity reached its lowest level of about 0.6 yg/pr in the mid 1970's. Productivity improved in the late 1970's, reaching 0.9 yg/pr in 1979. From 1980 to 1993 it varied between 1.3 and 2.0 yg/pr, which was sufficient to support an average annual increase in the breeding population size of about 9 percent (unpublished Service data on file, Fairbanks, Alaska). In Canada, a decrease in the productivity of arctic peregrine falcons was never clearly documented, although populations decreased in size so productivity almost certainly declined. At Rankin Inlet, NWT, productivity averaged about 1.5 yg/pr between 1981 and 1992 (Court  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . 1988; C. Shank, pers. comm., 1991, 1992), although annual productivity varied tremendously in response to variation in weather conditions (Court  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1988). Productivity in Ungava Bay, Quebec, reached a low of 1.33 yg/pr in 1970, and exceeded 2.7 yg/pr in each of 3 surveys conducted since 1980 (Bird and Weaver 1988; David Bird, pers. comm.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> in litt. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 1991). Reproductive rates have remained high in Greenland since observation began in 1972. In western Greenland productivity from 1972 to 1992 remained at least 1.80 yg/pr (William Mattox, Greenland Peregrine Falcon Survey, pers. comm.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> in litt. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 1992). Similarly, in southern Greenland, production remained high from 1981 to 1991 (Knud Falk, Ornis Consult A/S, pers. comm.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> in litt. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 1992).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The only recent measurable effect presumably attributable to organochlorine use in Latin America has been found in Rankin Inlet in the NWT. Between 1982 and 1986, pesticides caused about 10 percent of the nesting pairs to fail, but average productivity within the population was high, and numbers were stable at the extremely high density of one pair per 17 square kilometers (Court  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . 1988). Despite the effect on a small portion of the pairs, the overall impact to the population in this area was minimal. There has been no other recent evidence of pesticide-caused reproductive failure found in any other arctic peregrine falcon population studied.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In summary, the reproductive failure and resultant population crash seen in arctic peregrine falcons were likely the result of the heavy use of organochlorines in the United States and possibly Canada. However, arctic peregrines are still exposed to organochlorine pesticides due to continuing use in Latin America. Because organisms at the top of the food chain bioaccumulate environmentally stable contaminants, arctic peregrine falcons remain vulnerable and could suffer from an increase in the use of organochlorines or the widespread use of other stable toxins that affect survival or reproduction. The concentration of organochlorines in arctic peregrine falcon tissues continues to decline, though, and is currently well below those levels associated with population declines. The widespread recovery of arctic peregrine falcon populations is convincing evidence that pesticides and other contaminants do not currently threaten the continued existence of the subspecies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Service has carefully reviewed all available scientific and commercial data and concluded that the threat or threats that caused arctic peregrine falcon populations to decline no longer pose a risk to the continued survival of the subspecies. A widespread recovery has followed restrictions on the use of organochlorine pesticides in the United States and Canada. This recovery indicates that the subspecies is no longer endangered or likely to become endangered within the foreseeable future in a significant portion of its range. Under these circumstances, removal from the list of threatened and endangered wildlife is appropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553(d), the Service has determined that this rule relieves an existing restriction and good cause exists to make the effective date of this rule immediate. Delay in implementation of this delisting would cost government agencies staff time and monies conducting formal section 7 consultation on actions which may affect species no longer in need of the protection under the Act. Relieving the existing restriction associated with this listed species will enable Federal agencies to minimize any further delays in project planning and implementation for actions that may affect arctic peregrine falcons.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Effects of This Rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to the similarity of appearance provisions of section 4(e) of the Act, species (or subspecies or distinct vertebrate population segments) that are not considered to be endangered or threatened may nevertheless be treated as such for law enforcement purposes of protecting a listed species (or subspecies or vertebrate population segment) that is biologically endangered or threatened. Under the similarity of appearance provision (implemented by 50 CFR 17.50), the Service must find:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) that the species so closely resembles in appearance an endangered or threatened species that enforcement personnel would have substantial difficulty in identifying listed from unlisted species;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) that the effect of the substantial difficulty is an additional threat to the listed endangered or threatened species; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) that such treatment of an unlisted species will substantially facilitate the enforcement and further the purposes of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

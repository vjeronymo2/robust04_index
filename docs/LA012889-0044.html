			<p><P> January 28, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRESIDENT BUSH'S INAUGURAL ADDRESS  </P> <P> I was pleased with the tone of President Bush's inaugural address and his pleas  for decency and cooperation.  </P> <P> But his effort to rationalize the huge budget deficits with the statement "we  have more will than wallet" was upside down. We have the "wallet" to pay for  what we're spending, but we don't want to.  </P> <P> We've been brainwashed for eight years to believe we "don't deserve" to pay  taxes and that government and its activities are the problem, not the solution.  President Reagan has said these very words while observing we are in the midst  of prosperity.  </P> <P> He's taught Americans that, yes Virginia, there is a free lunch and your  grandchildren deserve to pay for it. We don't want to.  </P> <P> JOHN McSWEENEY  </P> <P> Studio City  </P></p>

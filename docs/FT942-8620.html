			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / International Company News: Casio profits tumble to Y7.37bn Casio Computer, Japan's leading maker of digital watches, yesterday announced a 36.1 per cent fall in pre-tax profits for the year ended March but forecast a vigorous earnings rebound. Casio, which exports more than half its total sales, blamed its decline on the yen's sharp appreciation in value. The company made a Y20bn exchange loss on its exports last year. Pre-tax profits fell to Y7.37bn (Dollars 70.3m) last year on sales which fell by 1.3 per cent to Y322.22bn. The group has restructured in response to the yen's rise faster than many Japanese exporters. Casio has pushed up its overseas output dramatically, from 20 per cent of the total in 1992 to 50 per cent last year. It plans to keep overseas production at the higher level in the current year. The company has also imported more foreign components. The group said the restructuring is forecast to reduce costs. The company plans that cost cutting will be the main feature of a projected 62.7 per cent recovery in pre-tax profits to Y12bn. Casio also plans to increase its sales by 5.5 per cent to Y340bn. The forecast is based on the assumption that the yen will hover at around Y100 to the dollar this year - close to its record high - said Mr Toshio Kozai, senior managing director. Casio's profits recovery will also be helped by the introduction of new products, plus economic recovery in Europe and the US, said the group. In the past year, sales of electronic notebooks for children and liquid crystal televisions were steady. But Mr Kozai admitted that digital watches sales in Europe were sluggish. The group also makes calculators and and electronic musical instruments.</p>

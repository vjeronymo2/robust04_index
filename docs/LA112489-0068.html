			<p><P> November 24, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> ALCATRAZ;  </P> <P> INDIANS MARK ISLAND OCCUPATION  </P> <P> Americans Indians and their supporters gathered Thanksgiving morning on  Alcatraz Island to commemorate the 20th anniversary of their occupation of "The  Rock" in San Francisco Bay. Hundreds of people were ferried to the island for  the sunrise ceremony, which has been held every year since 1975, said Tony  Gonzales, director of the International Indian Treaty Council. "The first  Thanksgiving happened in 1621," Gonzales said, "and the Indians sat at the same  table with Pilgrims. Then in 1622, the Pilgrims organized raiding parties and  slaughtered 600 Indians. Since that time, there hasn't been peace between  Indians and whites," he said. "Our un-Thanksgiving dinner, bringing Indians and  non-Indians together, is trying to change that."  </P></p>

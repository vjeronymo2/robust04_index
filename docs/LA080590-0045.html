			<p><P> August 5, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> QUAKE PROJECTIONS ARE ON SHAKY GROUND, SOME SAY  </P> <P> Iben Browning holds dozens of patents in several specialties, but it's his  earthquake projections that are stirring up notoriety he says he'd rather do  without.  </P> <P> Browning said at a conference in Missouri last year there was a high  probability of an earthquake along the New Madrid Fault this Dec. 2.  </P> <P> He was deluged by calls.  </P> <P> He insists that he did not predict an earthquake.  </P> <P> "The public always wants everything in black and white," Browning said.  </P> <P> "No one can tell you there is going to be an earthquake on Dec. 2, no one can  know that. . . . Everybody knows when he drives a car that he's taking a risk  that it will malfunction or crash. Yet people do drive cars. They're dealing in  probabilities."  </P> <P> Browning, 72, a large man with a graying burr haircut, says the public does not  understand -- and the press does not know how to communicate -- the idea of  probability.  </P> <P> "The closest you can translate probability into English is 'maybe.' But unless  you say 'maybe not,' they take it as an absolute," he said.  </P> <P> Browning, who publishes the Browning Newsletter on world climate, said his  climatological observations are based on high tidal forces produced by four  causes: the proximity of the moon to Earth; the proximity of Earth to the sun;  the alignment of the Earth, moon and sun during the full moon and new moon; and  the more perfect alignment of those bodies during eclipses. These factors  combine to produce tidal forces.  </P> <P> The same forces can trigger earthquakes, he said, and on Dec. 2, there will be  the highest combination of such factors in 60 years from 30 degrees to 60  degrees north latitude. That area includes the New Madrid Fault, running  roughly from Marked Tree, Ark., through New Madrid, Mo., to Cairo, Ill.  </P> <P> Since last year, when Browning raised the possibility of a December New Madrid  quake, the Arkansas National Guard has scheduled earthquake exercises for  around that time, one Arkansas school district is considering canceling classes  and sales of earthquake insurance have picked up.  </P> <P> But Browning said whether a given fault is actually triggered would depend on  the pressure built up along it. That information should come from area  seismologists, he said firmly.  </P> <P> If no earthquake occurs in or around December, Browning said people will be  more inclined to ignore the danger of the New Madrid Fault.  </P> <P> "That's what I fear more than anything else," he said. "People don't trust  authorities anymore; they never did trust them much. Why should they? What have  authorities done for them except tax them to death?"  </P> <P> Browning's earthquake projections are controversial among seismologists.  </P> <P> Klaus Jacob, senior research scientist at Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory  of Columbia University in Palisades, N.Y., said correlating earthquakes to  tidal forces doesn't work.  </P> <P> "It's more likely that in the next 10 years or 20 years we'll have something  (quake activity), rather than on this particular day," Jacob said. "You see,  earthquakes don't care about predictions. And people shouldn't worry about  predictions. They should worry about earthquakes."  </P> <P> Browning said he told a convention of chief executive officers in San Francisco  on Oct. 10, 1989, that there was a 50-50 chance of an earthquake registering 7  on the Richter scale on or about Oct. 16 because a high triggering force was  expected that date and geologists had determined there was a strain on the San  Andreas Fault.  </P> <P> An earthquake registering 7.1 hit Oct. 17, killing 67 people.  </P> <P> Jacob said: "He was just lucky. That's the law of large numbers."  </P> <P> Arch Johnston, director of the Center for Earthquake Research and Information  at Memphis State University in Tennessee, said Browning "is certainly not  justified scientifically."  </P> <P> "The tidal force that Dr. Browning bases his theory on has been examined  thoroughly by seismologists, and there's no evidence that tidal forces can  trigger earthquakes. . . . Earthquakes depend on the internal processes of the  Earth, not the external processes of the sun and moon."  </P> <P> Browning is chief scientist for Summa Medical Corp., an Albuquerque  biotechnology research and development company. His Summa resume says he holds  66 U.S. and foreign patents in optics, electronics, mechanics, chemistry,  electrooptics, hydraulics and educational toys.  </P> <P> Summa credits him -- he won't discuss what he does for the company -- with  developing new technology for compressing electronically transmitted human  speech.  </P> <P> Over the years, he has been a development physicist with American Optical Co.,  worked in optics for Bell Aircraft Corp. and was a scientist for Sandia  National Laboratories.  </P> <P> But gradually his interest in climatology grew. He said he has been accepted  commercially as a climatologist since 1974 when he became a consultant for  Paine Webber Inc.  </P> <P> His formal training was elsewhere: a bachelor's degree in math and physics from  Southwest Texas State University, and a master's degree in bacteriology  physiology and a doctorate in physiology, genetics and bacteriology from the  University of Texas at Austin.  </P> <P> "It turned out that in my observations of climate that all of the soft tools  with which I approached biology were applicable to climate," he said. "It's a  subject that is comparable in complexity to biology."  </P> <P> Business needs climate information because the weather determines how much food  will be produced and where, whether the transportation industry can get over  the roads, whether anything can be built, he said.  </P> <P> He provided forecasts for the 1989 edition of the Rocky Mountain Almanac and  "did as well or better than the Old Farmers' Almanac predictions," said Lee  Olson, almanac editor.  </P> <P> "He did predict the usual monsoons that come up in Arizona in late August, that  the Colorado Great Plains would receive extra moisture and store up adequate  moisture for the 1990 year," Olson said. "He had the ski season only partly. He  had it right for an early start, but it got dry around Christmas as I recall  and his timing was a little off on that."  </P></p>

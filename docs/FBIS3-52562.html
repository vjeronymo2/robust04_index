Speaking at the Foreign Ministry's regular forum, Abu-Salih  reiterated that the Sudan and Eritrea maintain strong and  fraternal relations, pointing out that the two countries ties  have been found [as heard] on strong principles. He said the  Sudan had extended continuous support to the Eritrean liberation  struggle till the country achieved independence, and that the  Sudan was among the first countries who supported Eritrea as an  independent state.    The foreign minister went on say that the Sudan now hosts  half a million Eritreans. Less than half of them are living in  nine camps under the supervision of the Sudanese Refugees  Administration. The refugees camps house refugees from all  colors of the political spectrum, the foreign minister said,  stressing that the refugees are not allowed to exercise any form  of political activity. Abu-Salih indicated that the Sudan  provides 75 percent of the needs of the Eritrean refugees while  the international community extends only 25 percent of their  requirements, calling for the conclusion of a tripartite  agreement between the governments of the Sudan and Eritrea and  the UNHCR to organize the voluntary repatriation of the Eritrean  refugees.</p>

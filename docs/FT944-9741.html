			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / Survey of Greece (1): European prosperity proves elusive - Disputes with its neighbours, political uncertainty and continuing recession are pushing Greece further from convergence with the EU These are difficult times for Greece. Its superficial gloss of European prosperity can no longer disguise the structural problems that are blocking prospects for long-term growth. The political parties, obsessed with personal rivalries and keeping alive the pervasive patronage system, show little awareness of the country's economic predicament. And disputes with its neighbours in the Balkans have further distanced the country from its European Union partners. The mood of frustration is reinforced by the refusal of Andreas Papandreou, the 76-year-old prime minister, to retire or appoint a deputy premier. Mr Papandreou's weakening health, which allows him to work for only a few hours a day, feeds media speculation over the succession struggle in the governing Panhellenic Socialist Movement, Pasok. But strict self-censorship by Greek newspapers and television suppresses any debate about when or even whether the ailing Mr Papandreou should make way for a younger leader. The waiting period will go on at least until parliament votes for a new president, a largely ceremonial job due to be relinquished next spring by another frail elderly statesman, Constantine Karamanlis. Mr Papandreou is the obvious candidate to take over, but Pasok controls only 170 of the 180 votes needed and he is not prepared to risk a humiliating defeat that would trigger a general election. A search has begun for a compromise presidential candidate who would be supported by some conservative and leftwing deputies in the 300-member house. Most opposition deputies are anxious to avoid an early poll, in spite of assertions by Miltiades Evert, who took over as leader of the conservative New Democracy party after its election defeat last year, that he could capture power. The conservatives are looking less ragged than before, as Mr Evert has enticed back a group of deputies who defected last year to the rightwing splinter group Political Spring, but he still cannot persuade the party's feuding factions to rally behind him. The results of last month's local government elections underlined the fact that support for Pasok is still strong, particularly in the countryside where the effects of recession have been less harsh. Although conservative candidates were elected as mayors of Athens and Thessaloniki, the cities where unemployment is highest, the socialists' popularity has survived their decision to abandon the generous wage and welfare spending of their first term in the 1980s in favour of tighter policies. The election in Athens of Dimitris Avramopoulos, an ex-diplomat with virtually no political experience, demonstrated, however, that voters are rejecting traditional party and ideological divisions. Significant, too, was the high nationwide abstention rate, indicating rising dissatisfaction with the politicians. After three decades in which many Greeks became city residents for the first time, while attaining a standard of living comparable to that elsewhere in southern Europe, attitudes are undergoing a radical change. Social and environmental problems, ranging from drug use to atmospheric pollution and the dumping of toxic waste, assume a much higher profile. The urge to modernise cuts across political boundaries. The pro-European technocrats in charge of economic policy under the socialists and the liberal faction in New Democracyhave more in common with each other than with old-style politicians in their own parties. But the present lack of leadership is undermining the technocrats' chances of pushing through structural reforms needed to help the economy catch up with the rest of the EU. The government's decision last week to postpone the partial flotation of OTE, the state telecommunications monopoly, until next year is just one example of how special interest groups, in this case the telecoms company's powerful union, can obstruct the reform process. Political opposition to the flotation, together with the socialists' commitment to continued state management, had a negative impact on overseas investors' interest in the offering. It is not just the possibility of losing some Dr300bn (Pounds 790m) in revenues that worries the economy ministry. Failure to float the telecoms company would raise doubts about the partial privatisations being planned and put at risk Greece's convergence programme for participating in EU economic and monetary union. Moreover, with the state still controlling some 60 per cent of the economy, overhauling public corporations is important in trying to shrink the public sector deficit. Low productivity at state-controlled banks, transport companies and government agencies, where payrolls are crammed with patronage appointees, makes it harder to reduce inflation, which has been stuck for most of this year at about 11 per cent. Greece's hopes of economic recovery are based on its Ecu14.8bn (Pounds 11.64bn) share of the EU's new structural package designed to help its poor members achieve economic convergence. Infrastructure improvements, with the EU providing up to 80 per cent of funding, should promote growth and competitiveness. Yet only one EU-backed project has been awarded - a sea-bed tunnel linking two ports in western Greece - while disputes with the European Commission over contract terms are blocking the start of construction of a new Athens airport, port improvements and several hundred kilometres of motorways. Without strong political backing, the finance ministry's new campaign to curb corruption at tax offices, broaden the tax base and cut tax evasion could quickly crumble. Plans for including credit card payments and mortgage loans, as well as obvious items such as yachts and luxury cars, into the new list of 'wealth indicators' that are being used to calculate tax liability have been met with fierce opposition. Whatever happens, next year marks a turning point. Economy ministry planners know that unless progress is made towards convergence, by 1996, when the EU reviews its future, Greece's status will decline further with the arrival of new entrants from eastern Europe. But with EU transfers to Greece to amount to almost 5 per cent of gross domestic product in the next five years, few Greek politicians seem aware that the years of generous hand-outs from Brussels may soon be over. It does not help, either, that Greece is quarrelling with two out of three of its Balkan neighbours. Suspicion runs so deep in the region that even if disputes with Albania and Macedonia can be patched up soon, trade and investment prospects are likely to suffer in the future. The eight-month trade embargo against Macedonia has frozen business contacts and will also affect earnings this year at Greece's northern port of Thessaloniki, formerly the main outlet for Macedonian exports. In Albania where Greek investment was increasing, smaller projects have been frozen and there are fears that Italian companies may now be preferred over Greek companies in competitive bids for infrastructure projects. Greek officials realise that readiness to implicate the EU in these bilateral disputes, by vetoing European aid to both countries, damages their own relationship with Brussels. Yet in spite of a perceptible decline in nationalist feeling, which triggered the rows over Macedonia's name and the status of the ethnic Greek minority in southern Albania, Greek attitudes on minority rights at home still reflect outdated policies. Accusations persist of discrimination against Greece's Moslem minority in Thrace, while the efforts of Slav-speakers in Greece's northern provinces - who would be called the Macedonian minority if they lived anywhere but Greece - to preserve their language and cultural traditions still face political obstacles.</p>

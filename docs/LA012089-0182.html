			<p><P> January 20, 1989, Friday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> GERMAN ALL BUT CINCHES SKATING TITLE  </P> <P> West Germany's Claudia Leistner all but locked up the women's title as she took  a commanding leading after today's original program at the European Figure  Skating Championships.  </P> <P> Leistner skated to a lively version of big-band music that earned first-place  marks from the judges. She had led after the school figures.  </P> <P> With a factored placing of 1.0 with the free skating left, she would have to  finish fourth or worse in the final program Saturday afternoon to lose the  championship.  </P> <P> "Skating last, I had to wait a long time," Leistner said. "They all came back  laughing or crying. But I felt good on the ice and I hope I can do it  tomorrow."  </P> <P> If she skates as well as she did in the original program, she will not have any  problem succeeding Katarina Witt as European champion.  </P> <P> The next three places are extremely tight. Second was British champion Joanne  Conway, who pleased the home crowd with a clean but safe routine. Third was the  Soviet Union's Natalie Lebedeva and fourth was East Germany's Simone Lang.  </P> <P> Soviets have won both titles already decided. Larisa Selezneva and Oleg Makarov  won the pairs event and Aleksandr Fadeev captured the men's crown.  </P> <P> Fadeev won his fourth European championship since 1984 despite being penalized  by a British judge for his costume in Thursday's men's original program.  </P></p>

The copyright bill, classified as urgent, was forwarded to  the Sejm on 23 November 1994. Such a mode of proceedings was  criticized by Zbigniew Romaszewski: "Urgent proceedings make it  practically impossible for the Senate to influence this law,"  said Romaszewski. The "Solidarity" senator said that the  producer's rights were too broad and proposed that the period in  which they are binding be shortened from 10 to five years, which  the chamber did (there was no vote against it), after the  committees had issued positive opinions. It adopted the law,  despite the negative stand by Deputy Minister of Culture Piotr  Lukasiewicz, who explained that "the producer is not only a fat  capitalist with a cigar in his mouth, but also the one who  organizes the process of creating work."    The new Copyright Law envisions absolution for owners of  computer software which they obtained, in violation of the law,  before the effective date of this law. "What would we look like  if in an agreement with the United States, we decided that as  soon as the agreement comes into effect, all automobiles stolen  in the United States will be the legal property of the people  who bought them?" protested Piotr L. Andrzejewski, on behalf of  the Club of the Independent Self-Governing Trade Union  "Solidarity." "The theft of computer software and the theft of  automobiles are two entirely different things; a person who  obtained given software in a non- prohibited manner cannot be  told not to use it," argued Senator Jan Orzechowski of the  Polish Peasant Party; the majority of the senators agreed with  his view.    "Poland is believed to be a real paradise for pirates. The  production and sale of those people's products is a large sector  of the economy; however, it is in fact like a tumor. Due to the  fact that this sector exists, everyone is losing, except the  pirates themselves," said Piotr Lukasiewicz, undersecretary of  state in the Ministry of Culture and Art; he was for maintaining  the absolution concerning stolen software.    Among the proposals that the senators turned down was also  prolonging vacation legis [preceding two words in Latin] from  three to six months from the day the law is passed -- "to give  appropriate establishments the time to become familiar with it."    It was agreed that it will be lawful to perform literary,  musical, and literary-musical works in public, free of charge  ("if this is not done with a view to making a profit"), and to  distribute them, without the author's permission, for "didactic  and scientific purposes."    The senators decided that a court of law must state the  forfeiture of the "unlawfully manufactured specimens of works";  it may also, but is not obliged by the law, to state the  forfeiture of the objects by means of which the offense was  committed.    Solidarity senators expressed doubts of a rather general  nature. Piotr L. Andrzejewski stated that the Copyright Law  violates the constitutional right to associate and introduces a  "Stalinist criterion of the warranty of the right  administration," which will be decided by the governmental  administration.    On Thursday [13 January], the Sejm also adopted amendments  to  the Geological and Mining Law.</p>

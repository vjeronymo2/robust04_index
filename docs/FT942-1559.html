			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Buyers come to copper's rescue after early fall The copper market burst into life again late yesterday after pausing for breath earlier this week. However, analysts warned that the copper price - and prices of other London Metal Exchange-traded metals - might be heading for a fall in the third quarter. Copper for delivery in three months, which at one point yesterday dropped to Dollars 2,417 a tonne, closed on the London Metal Exchange at Dollars 2,451.50, up Dollars 18.25 a tonne from Tuesday's close. Traders said that some Japanese buying stopped copper's price fall and later the Chinese also came in with 'buy' orders. Mr Nick Moore, analyst at Ord Minnett, said the market was still unsure whether there would be the usual summer lull in business. He added: 'I suspect that there will be a lull and the onset of the third-quarter seasonal demand weakness will indeed witness lower metal prices in the coming quarter. These lower prices will, however, offer a period of consolidation as a prelude to a fresh acceleration (in copper's price) in the final quarter'. At GNI, analyst Mr Lawrence Eagles suggested that, if copper should begin to fall back, other metals would follow. The sell-off was likely to be most aggressive for those metals, such as zinc, which had the worst over-supply problems. Mr Ted Arnold, metals specialist at Merrill Lynch, remained more bullish. Although he accepted that the copper market might be very volatile in coming weeks and he would not be surprised to see daily trading ranges of 3 to 5 cents a pound, he forecast that three-month copper would trade over the next two to three months between Dollars 2,250 and Dollars 2,550 a tonne (Dollars 1.02 to Dollars 1.16 a pound).</p>

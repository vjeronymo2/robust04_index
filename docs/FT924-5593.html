			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / Australian MP ousted by court AUSTRALIA'S Labor government could face a difficult by-election before next year's general election following a High Court ruling yesterday which ejects an independent MP from parliament, writes Kevin Brown in Sydney. Mr Phil Cleary won the Melbourne seat of Wills in April in a by-election dominated by his attacks on the liberal economic policies of both the government and the conservative opposition. The defeat was doubly embarrassing for the government because the seat was held until March by Mr Bob Hawke, former prime minister. Mr Cleary, a Melbourne teacher, lost his seat after the court ruled that he was a paid public official at the time of the election, even though he was on unpaid leave throughout the campaign. Mr Cleary could be required to repay his parliamentary salary, and could be fined ADollars 200 (Pounds 91) for each day he sat in parliament if an elector pursued the issue in court. Ironically, the court ruled that the Labor and conservative candidates were also ineligible because both were dual citizens who had taken insufficient steps to renounce their foreign citizenship.</p>

He said that the Federal Government would  have no choice but to respect the outcome of the constitutional  conference provided it would not be toward tearing the nation  apart. The minister urged Nigerians to regard dialogue which  the conference will offer as a better alternative to crises and  social disorder. He, therefore, appealed to all those calling  for a boycott of the delegates' election to have a rethink.  Prof. Gana called on all Nigerians to come out en masse on  Monday [23 May] and exercise their civic responsibility.  [passage indistinct] [end recording]</p>

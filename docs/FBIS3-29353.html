A South Korean Embassy official in Moscow contacted Vladimir  Kumachev, a senior researcher quoted in the press, and was told  he was misquoted, Paek Nak-whan, director-general of European  Affairs, said. Kumachev, with Russia's Institute of National  Security and Strategic Research, was quoted as saying that North  Korea has nuclear weapons "according to information we have  received."    He was also quoted as saying Pyongyang carried out nuclear  tests in African countries. A Russian official, asked to verify  the reports, said he wasn't even aware of the existence of the  named institute.    Kumachev told the South Korean Embassy official that he only  said North Korea "could be" possessing nuclear arms as claimed  by certain press reports and is trying to build up its weapons  program, Paek said.    The Russian official assured Seoul that North Korea does not  have the precision technique involved for a nuclear weapons  program and does not have the launching capability, he said.</p>

			<p><P> July 2, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WEATHERMEN  </P> <P> Thank you for the story of the weathermen who dedicate their lives to  monitoring the planet's health, or lack of it ("Weathermen of the Apocalypse,"  by Michael Rogers, May 21). It must be difficult to know the horrid truth and  be responsible for telling the nation.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, there are too many people who don't believe that they, as  individuals, truly can make a difference. It will take everyone on this planet  to help heal the wounds all of us are responsible for inflicting.  </P> <P> JANET COLE  </P> <P> Long Beach  </P></p>

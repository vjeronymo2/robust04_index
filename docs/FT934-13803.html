			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / Arts: Sonny's flights of fancy - Jazz Sonny Rollins, 'saxophone colossus', is generally regarded as one of the most important (surviving) figures in modern jazz. With a considered technique and driven by awesome stamina and dexterity, the 64 year old New Yorker has set the standard for saxophone the improvisors for the last 40 years. An annual visitor to Europe, he is fussy about the venues he plays and on Monday he brought the regular band and his rag bag of battered old tunes to the Theatre Royal in Drury Lane. For the committed Rollins fans this will have been a source of great relief and joy: since the 1970s the Rollins repertoire has consisted of short but strong melodies which provide recognisable reference points for the saxophonist's flights of fancy. The band's role is strictly a as reliable support crew which provides some mid-air refuelling for the boss between aerobatics. So it was on Monday. With a familiar flight plan comprising old favourites such as 'Duke of Iron', 'Prelude to a Kiss', and 'Long Ago and Faraway', Rollins roared matter-of-factly over his musical landscape like a veteran flying circus pilot. Breathtaking time changes like stall turns are executed effortlessly; now he loops around a fast moving melody with deadly grace, later ambushing the rhythm from behind before finally turning genial barrel rolls through a tin pan alley tune like 'Tennessee Waltz'. The band looks skyward indulgently. Jerome Harris and Bob Cranshaw on electric guitar and bass were solid and slavish while Cliff Anderson's trombone supplied buoyant fat notes to fill where Rollins took a breather. A new and welcome addition to the band came in the unlikely shape of percussionist Victor See Yuan whose Confucian appearance belied a splendidly kinetic way with congas and various shakers. But if Rollins retains all the old firepower as well as the chocs-away trickery in his display, the repertoire is beginning to sound all too familiar for a performer whose appeal has always been strongest heard live. The corny, jangly C &amp; W tinged 'Tennessee Waltz' and his calypso trademark 'Don't Stop the Carnival' brought loud cheers of approval from the full house, but that did not entirely extinguish the strong feeling of deja vu.</p>

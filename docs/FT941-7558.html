			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / Can Europe Compete?: Why a buoyant US and Asia pity poor old listless Europe - The view from outside Europe's flagging prowess prompts surprise, criticism and - worst of all - pity from business leaders in the US and Asia. Many American executives, basking in their country's economic revival, are scathing about the Old World's inability to find the path back to growth. Although corporate Japan is preoccupied by the country's own recession, its representatives wonder aloud about Europe's capacity to solve its problems. Elsewhere, in east Asia's booming 'tiger' economies, industrialists say bluntly that Europe will slip further in the competitiveness league unless it adopts more free market medicine. Many US executives attribute their country's economic recovery to the creative energy of American capitalism. They view Europe, by contrast, as a soft, sclerotic society, addicted to subsidies, welfare handouts and long holidays. 'Painful as it must be, Europe needs to celebrate change,' says Mr Tom Theobald, chairman of Continental Bank. 'Some wonderful cultural and societal values are bottled up in European tradition, but the communication and transportation revolution no longers allows the continent to be walled off from world competititors. Change is frightening, even in America, but Europe must master the art.' Americans acknowledge that, in sectors such as power generation equipment, chemicals and retailing, Europe remains competitive. However, Europe is regarded as lagging badly in many important high technology industries, including computer hardware and software, data networking, and multi-media telephony and entertainment. One top executive at a leading US electronics group says most American companies know relatively little about European companies because so few of them are good enough to set standards in their individual sectors. European volume motor manufacturers, for years protected from Japanese competition, are regarded as well behind the European operations of Ford and General Motors in productivity and cost-cutting. Americans point to recent decisions by Germany's BMW and Mercedes-Benz to locate new factories in the southern US. This shows, they say, how European industry is trying to escape high domestic costs by moving abroad. Japanese executives these days pay less attention to Europe, reflecting a shift in Japan's investment priorities to China and other parts of Asia. Additionally, BMW's surprise move to buy 80 per cent of Rover, the UK motor company in which Honda holds a 20 per cent stake, has reminded Japanese businessmen of the differences in corporate culture between Europe and Asia. Mr Toyoo Gyoten, chairman of the Bank of Tokyo, says Europe faces 'multiple challenges' as a result of 'dangerously high' unemployment and post-cold war uncertainties. Mr Gyoten says an important priority is 'to complete the reunification of Germany as soon as possible'. 'United Germany is bound to play the role of an anchor in the economic and political stability of Europe. However, it didn't take much time for our German friends to discover that the task of unification was indeed a daunting one.' Mr Gyoten adds that the collapse of the European Monetary System has 'maimed' momentum towards economic integration. Europe will remain a federation of nation states, he says. 'Convergence of economic fundamentals must come first before artificial institutionalisation (of European union.)' The most outspoken advocacy of free market solutions comes from South Korea. Mr Bae Soonhoon, president of Daewoo Electronics, says: 'The solution to the European malaise is simple: give Adam Smith as much chance to work as possible. Remove the paternalistic protection given to industry and workers, which in many cases is neither wanted or needed. 'Europeans must recognise that today's comforts have been made possible by the industriousness of their forefathers, and the value of hard work must be relearned from them.' Mr SaKong Il, a former South Korean finance minister and president of the Institute for Global Economics in Seoul, says Europe has lost its sense of priorities. 'It has been devoting too much time and energy to political integration. It has not paid enough attention to unemployment and other social problems. These are now the issues - and they cannot be remedied by quick-fix solutions.'</p>

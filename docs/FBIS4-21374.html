			<p>CSO     [Text] There are approximately 133,000 hectares of  shrimp nets in the country. It would hardly be possible for  150,000 hectares of mangrove swamps to be devastated, leaving  only 40,000 in Ancon de Sardinas: National Chamber of  Aquaculture.    Guayaquil Staff: The National Chamber of Aquaculture has  expressed concern and constant support for the creation of a  system for surveillance and monitoring of the mangrove swamps  and the ecosystem. This also entails a revision of the penalties  in effect under the present regulations.    The institution's executive director, Harold Muller, gave  explanatory reports on the statistics for mangrove swamp  depredation ascribed to shrimp production.    According to statistical data from the Remote Sensor  Integrated Surveys Center (Clirsen), the distribution of  mangrove swamps in Esmeraldas covers 32,032 hectares.    The Coastal Resources Management Program (PMRC), in its  series of management plans for the special management zones  (ZEM) of Atacames-Sua-Muisne, indicates that, between 1969 and  1987, the reduction in the mangrove swamp area surface totaled  approximately 1,000 hectares.    This decline compounds that caused by shrimp nets, removal  of  mangrove piles, and charcoal production, which amounts to 1.2  million pounds per year in the Muisne area alone.    Muller proved with documentary evidence that the mangrove  swamp reserve is nearly intact. He declared that there is an  error in the claim that 150,000 hectares of mangroves out of a  total of 300,000 have been felled.    There has also been a claim that, in 1986, the Esmeraldas  mangrove swamp was declared a protective forest and that,  despite this, over 150,000 hectares have been felled since that  date, leaving at present only 40,000 in the Ancon de Sardinas  estuary.    Muller gave a reminder that the shrimp industry in the  country as a whole occupies approximately 133,000 hectares. He  added that 150,000 could hardly be devastated, leaving only  40,000 hectares on the Ancon de Sardinas estuary: something that  is not true.    He stressed that it was at the sector's initiative that the  national government was requested to cease granting new  concessions for the construction of shrimp ponds, and noted that  these authorizations have been suspended.    On several occasions that institution has asked the  government to exercise strict control over the indiscriminate  felling of mangroves on the national territory, so as to prevent  unscrupulous persons from continuing their deforestation work.  This is especially necessary since the sector has been fully  aware that the mangrove swamp constitutes a fundamental element  in the ecosystem, primarily in the development of shrimp itself.    "Therefore, we are the first to take precautions and oversee  the good condition of our resources."    Although the shrimp sector, and particularly the National  Chamber of Aquaculture, have been the first to report, and to  give constant cooperation to the authorities, it is regrettable  that our laws do not call for example-setting penalties.    Because of this situation, the efforts expended by  shrimpers,  fishery authorities, and the navy are being constantly thwarted  by the land traffickers.    Minimal, and even ridiculous penalties are imposed on those  engaged in the repugnant task of destroying mangrove swamps.    The Aquaculture Chamber is also concerned about proposing a  revision of the penalties in effect in the regulations.    Muller emphasized that the shrimp industry accounts for over  31 percent of private exports and, more than an environmental  impact, is having a significant economic and social effect. It  generates foreign exchange in an amount equivalent to $525  million.    Moreover, it employs over 200,000 full-time workers  directly,  and over 90,000 persons indirectly. This means that 7.2 percent  of the country's economically active population makes its living  largely from the shrimp industry.    During recent times especially, many private and state  organizations have come out in defense of the Ecuadoran mangrove  swamp.    The shrimp sector, in particular, is accused of being the  main cause of the deterioration of vast riparian areas of the  Ecuadoran coast.</p>

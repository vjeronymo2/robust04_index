			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["U.S. Imperialists and South Korean Puppets Stage Surprise </F> Strike Exercise and Gunfiring Against North" -- KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, April 2 (KCNA) -- The U.S. imperialists  and the South Korean puppets on March 31 hurled fighter planes  of various types including F-15s and FA-18s into the skies above  Nyongwol, Wonju and Chunchon and staged an exercise of surprise  strike at targets in the midst of electronic jamming, according  to military sources.    In separate action that day, large-calibre artillery groups  and heavily-armed bandits of the puppet army took firing  positions in Cholwon County, South Korean Kangwon Province,  Phaju and Ryonchon Counties, Kyonggi Province, and kicked up a  war frenzy, firing over 60 105mm shells and 1,000 large-calibre  machinegun bullets into spots near the Demilitarized Zone along  the Military Demarcation Line.    On the same day, the puppets deployed scores of  large-calibre  guns in Cholwon County, South Korean Kangwon Province, and  brought some 500 armed bandits into areas near Rinje and  Ryonchon Counties.    Some ten helicopter gunships and transport helicopters of  the  puppet army flew into the skies above Ryonchon and Phochon and  Cholwon, areas under the very nose of the North side's portion  for a frantic exercise of support to ground attack and war  materiel airlifting.</p>

During the conference Geriletu, member of the autonomous  regional party standing committee and secretary of the  autonomous regional discipline inspection commission, delivered  a speech in which he said: Since September 1993, the regional  level units as well as various leagues and cities have generally  conducted various work set in the struggle against corruption  under the conditions of short time limit, of heavy tasks, and of  that the struggle involves in a large range of things. Most  localities and departments have earnestly and actively launched  the struggle against corruption and scored certain achievements  in the three tasks of the struggle. Negative and corrupt  phenomena have somewhat disappeared and the people's confidence  in the struggle has been somewhat enhanced. The development of  the work as a whole has been healthy. During the struggle  against corruption, party committees and governments at all  levels have paid attention to it and established the  responsibility system at all levels for the struggle. They have  effectively conducted supervision and inspection over the  struggle work. Various localities and departments have steadily  upgraded their ideology and understanding by urging their  personnel to steadily enhance their study while waging the  struggle. Many localities have vigorously grasped the  implementation of the work by persistently proceeding from  reality and emphatically dealt with their own prominent problems.    Geriletu pointed out: In reviewing the work done over the  past four months, we must note while acknowledging the  achievements that there still is a large gap between the effects  scored in the struggle as well as the demands set forth by the  CPC Central Committee and the autonomous regional party  committee and the people's expectation. Things that have been  done in the struggle work still cannot satisfy the people's  feeling. We should fully discern the importance, emergency, and  arduousness of the struggle; overcome the thinking of adopting a  wait and see attitude, implicating others, and fearing  difficulties; and further enhance the leadership over the  struggle and vigorously grasp the implementation of the  struggle's tasks.    In citing the struggle around the Spring Festival, Geriletu  said: Efforts should be made to further enhance the study, to  continuously upgrade the ideology and understanding of cadres at  all levels and the vast number of people, to unswervingly and  successfully grasp the three tasks for the recent period. In  organizing leading personnel, it is imperative to enhance the  unified leadership between party committees and governments and  to uphold and implement the work-division responsibility system  among leading personnel for the struggle. In encouraging  leading cadres to perform their official duties honestly and to  conduct self discipline, we should vigorously handle various  problems discovered from their self examinations. In  investigating and handling serious and appalling cases, we  should accelerate the pace of handling the exposed important  cases and further rely on the mass to actively report the  corrupt phenomena through letters or visits. We should achieve  in having every report offered through letters or visits be  accepted seriously. In correcting malpractice, the cases of  making overseas travels with public funds and illegally  purchasing imported sedans should be totally handled before the  Spring Festival. Efforts should be made to step up the work of  checking the illegal business and enterprises run by the party  and government organs, of correcting the arbitrary collections,  and of clarifying the two line of revenue and spending. The key  departments of banking, electric power, railways, and post and  telecommunication should continuously and vigorously grasp the  consolidation in their specialized working projects.    Geriletu urged various localities and departments to  earnestly summarize the work done in the struggle for this  period, put forward work arrangements for next period, and to  take the struggle for promoting the establishment of socialist  market economic systems by proceeding from the whole situation.  Localities should strictly implement the spirit of circulars  issued the general offices of the CPC Central Committee, the  State Council, the autonomous regional party committee, and the  autonomous regional people's government so as to have a happy  Spring Festival with an honest and peaceful atmosphere.    Yun Bulong, vice chairman of the autonomous regional  people's  government, presided over the television conference and also  delivered a speech.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Rauf Gerz: "Officials Fear Aircraft From Romania </F> Transporting Arms to Yemen"]    [Text] Cargo planes from Romania are believed to have  transported large quantities of arms to north Yemen since the  outbreak of the war in Yemen. Cargo planes fly from Romania to  Yemen through Turkey's airspace twice every night. The flights  and the weight of cargo have led officials to consider the  possibility that arms are being supplied from Romania to Yemen.    Gigantic Russian-made Ilyushin-76 cargo planes have taken  off  at night from Otopeni Airport in Bucharest to fly to Sanaa in  north Yemen for the past 20 days. The next day they returned  empty. The aircraft reportedly obtained permission to transport  vegetables through Turkey's airspace. The aircraft maintained  the same flight route. They entered Turkey's airspace from the  "Rixan" air corridor over the Black Sea and left it over  Antalya. The Ilyushin-76 aircraft, the largest cargo planes in  the world, fly at 24,000 feet (8,000 meters) when they cross  through Turkey's airspace, although that altitude is not  economic for such aircraft on long-distance flights.  Considering the planes' altitude, military aviation experts  have said they may be carrying arms. An expert said: "Cargo  planes may fly at a higher altitude even if they are fully  loaded with tomatoes. I do not believe the cargo they transport  exceeds 150 tonnes. A cargo that heavy can only be made up of  arms."    Turkey has no right to place the cargo aircraft under its  control, because there is no UN ban on arms to Yemen. But the  Treaty on Conventional Forces in Europe gives it the right to  search any aircraft in its airspace that it believes to be  carrying a cargo of arms.</p>

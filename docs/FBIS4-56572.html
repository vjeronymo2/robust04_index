			<p>BFN     [Text] The recently dedicated Maya Aqueduct will benefit  more than 14,000 people, representing more than half the  population of Maisi Muncipality, the easternmost point in Cuba  and the main coffee producer in the country. Further details on  this by reporter Leonel Perez Moya:    [Begin Perez recording] Using its own resources, at a cost  of  690,000 pesos, the revamped plant operates by gravity and  replaces the old, inefficient installation that has been  corroded by inclement weather. The approximate five km of  conduits and pipes of various diameters, leading to the main  duct, replaces the pumping system, with an annual savings of 590  megawatts of electricity.    This inexpensive technology provides for a continuous supply  of potable water to residents of Punta de Maisi on the  easternmost point of the nation; to La Maquina, the center of  Maisi Municipality; and to eight other populated settlements.  Water is also carried to the largest coffee plant in the zone  and to the family doctors' offices, to schools, minifarms,  agricultural areas, and other socioeconomic institutions.

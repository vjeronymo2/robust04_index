			<p>BFN     [Text] Quito, 27 May (EFE) -- Human rights organizations in  Quito today reported that Celso Garbarz, an Italian citizen and  a member of the Amnesty International (AI) executive committee,  was attacked by unidentified individuals who left him  unconscious on a street in a tourist sector of Quito. "Robbery  was not the motive for the crime because none of his personal  possessions were taken. He was attacked by three men," Elsie  Monge, president of the Ecumenical Human Rights Committee  (CEDHU), told EFE.    Garbarz attended the annual meeting of the Ecuadoran chapter  of the AI in Cuenca last week. He was visiting Quito at the time  of the attack. Last night Garbarz flew to London where the AI  headquarters are located.    Elsie Monge said that "while in Cuenca and Quito, the AI  official addressed the issues of detained and missing people,  difficulties in recognizing the status of refugees, and  systematic torture in Ecuador."    According to statements made by Garbarz, on Sunday he was  attacked by three well-dressed and armed men who stepped out of  a vehicle "and began hitting and insulting me without any  explanation, inflicting multiple wounds and contusions, and  leaving me lying unconscious on the street."    A communique issued by some 20 Ecuadoran human rights and  church organizations stresses that "this attack is an attempt to  stop the work being done to denounce the violations being  committed in Ecuador and to frighten human rights organizations  because of these organization's actions in the defense of the  victims of institutional violence."</p>

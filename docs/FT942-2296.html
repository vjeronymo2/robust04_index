			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / International Company News: Life company farms out derivatives management Confederation Life, Canada's fourth biggest life company, has passed on the management of its derivatives portfolio to Sumitomo Bank Capital Markets. Many companies have become increasingly nervous about using derivatives, following losses in recent months by Metallgesellschaft, Procter &amp; Gamble, and others. While it is highly unusual for a company to farm out all its derivatives management to an outside specialist, the growing need for sophisticated operational controls and computer systems when using derivatives has made it increasingly difficult for companies to manage risk effectively in-house. SBCM will take over the risk management activities of Confederation Treasury Services under guidelines and policies set by the company. 'We will manage their books, but some transactions will require authorisation,' said SBCM. It will use its Prism front-to-back office system, developed in-house, to perform services such as daily valuation, risk analysis, trade confirmations, payments and rate resets. Prism supports SBCM's current portfolio of over 10,000 swap transactions in 17 currencies. SBCM's Derivatives Products Group has 170 employees in New York, London and Hong Kong, having poached teams from Pru-Bache and Security Pacific in the late 1980s.</p>

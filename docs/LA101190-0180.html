			<p><P> October 11, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REAL ESTATE DOWNTURN HITS HOME;  </P> <P> PROPERTIES: A SURVEY OF SAN GABRIEL VALLEY REAL ESTATE BOARDS SHOWS A 30% DROP  IN SALES FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 1990.  </P> <P> It all started when Dean Borton was suddenly, as he put it, "blessed with early  retirement."  </P> <P> In other words, the public relations firm Borton worked for, "gearing down" for  some expected losses, decided to give the 64-year-old copywriter a head start  on his Golden Years.  </P> <P> Borton and his wife Meredith had a plan. They'd sell their Diamond Bar house at  a nifty profit, they thought, and go back home to a lake in Michigan, where the  living is cheap and unstressful.  </P> <P> The Bortons had bought the house -- a stucco-walled hillside home with a shake  roof, a swimming pool shaped like a big footstep and a scintillating view of  the San Gabriel Mountains -- for $160,000 in 1984. Considering the way property  values had risen in the late 1980s in the San Gabriel Valley, they figured  they'd sell for $290,000. Easy.  </P> <P> That was in January. Since then, they've dropped the price by $10,000, gone  into escrow twice -- both sales fell through -- and taken over the brokerage  duties themselves. And still the house is unsold.  </P> <P> Nowadays, after Meredith goes off to her job at a direct marketing firm, Dean  busies himself manicuring an already weed-free yard and thinking about that  lake in Michigan. "I'm getting a little edgy," he says. "I'm at the point now  where I'm going to have to find something else to keep my nimble mind busy."  </P> <P> The real estate downturn, which has thrown a wet blanket on the housing market  all over the United States, has arrived with a vengeance in the San Gabriel  Valley. Interviews with agents and brokers show:  </P> <P> * Houses -- particularly in the $300,000 to $500,000 range -- have been  languishing with "For Sale" signs on their front lawns for a year or more.  </P> <P> * The infusion of foreign capital, particularly from Asia, that kept the San  Gabriel Valley market hot through most of the 1980s has slowed considerably.  </P> <P> * Houses that do sell are often going for far less than equivalent houses sold  for a year ago. Brokers say that there is a widening gap between asking price  and selling price.  </P> <P> Except in the low end of the market, in which houses sell for under $200,000,  buyers are scarce.  </P> <P> Most real estate agents don't like talking about the down side of their  business. "We're talking ourselves into a recession," said broker Alex Turner,  a former president of the East San Gabriel Valley Board of Realtors. "Marginal  people are being scared out of the market because there's too much negative  talk."  </P> <P> But a survey of the real estate boards in the San Gabriel Valley shows that,  for the first nine months of 1990, sales are down throughout the region by 30%,  compared with the equivalent period last year. At the same time, the inventory  of properties for sale has risen dramatically.  </P> <P> "Weekend open houses are really dead," said Diamond Bar City Councilwoman  Phyllis Papen, an agent for Remax Diamond Bar. "What you get are not buyers but  escrow company representatives and lenders, coming by with cookies and cold  drinks" to drum up business for themselves.  </P> <P> Most real estate brokers expect the slowdown to last well into next year, when  the San Gabriel Valley's strengths will begin to assert themselves again.  </P> <P> Some agents say they're experiencing a normal cyclic downturn after several  years of soaring prices, just as in any financial market.  </P> <P> "People don't worry when the stock market has a tremendous surge, then settles  back to a reasonable advance," said Jack Newe, broker-owner of Century 21 E-N  Realty in Diamond Bar.  </P> <P> Two years ago, prime properties in the region were being snapped up as soon as  they went on the market. Real estate agents talk fondly now of the go-go years,  when some houses got seven or eight offers on the day the "For Sale" signs went  up.  </P> <P> Now, everybody has horror stories about houses that won't sell.  </P> <P> Richard and Esther Schuster just sold their house in a well-to-do neighborhood  in western Pasadena after it was listed for a year and a half. The couple and  their two children moved to a bigger house in the same neighborhood in May 1989  and started paying two mortgages, expecting the first house to sell pretty  quickly.  </P> <P> "I had a feeling we'd sell it by the end of the year and get about $700,000 for  it," said Schuster, a manufacturer of biodegradable paper products.  </P> <P> They finally closed the deal for the house in September, selling it for  $560,000.  </P> <P> Some real estate agents say the situation appears to be more than a simple  market adjustment.  </P> <P> "It's not just affecting realtors, it's affecting banks," Papen said. "The  market is tightening up on home equity loans and bridge loans.  </P> <P> "You used to be able to get a home equity loan, then go out and buy a second  piece of property. But those are a lot harder to get now."  </P> <P> There is still a strong market for "starter" houses, agents say. "If there is  such a thing as a $150,000 house, it'll sell -- yesterday," said Monrovia  broker George Baker.  </P> <P> But "move-up" sellers -- those seeking to cash in on middle-level properties in  order to move up to a larger, more expensive house -- are finding buyers  scarce.  </P> <P> "About two thirds of our sales are in the move-up category," said William  Podley, president of the Pasadena-based Podley Caughey &amp; Doan Associates.  "We're especially active in the $300,000 to $1 million range. Our sales are off  by more than 30%."  </P> <P> "There are three elements to a sale -- a buyer, a seller and financing," said  Newe. "We've got interest rates at less than 11%, and there are sellers willing  to sell. But the buyers -- they're holding back, convinced that bad times are  here."  </P> <P> Others are convinced that the buyers are out there. The secret to finding them  is "proper pricing," real estate agents say.  </P> <P> "The sellers are going through a re-education process," said Fran  Barrington-Dryden, an agent for Coldwell Banker in San Marino, who expects her  income to be the same this year as it was last year. "Of course, they all hoped  that prices would continue to escalate. But they just couldn't.  </P> <P> "It's a little shock to them to think that a house four doors down sold a year  ago for $100,000 more than they can get now."  </P> <P> Few sellers are actually losing money, Barrington-Dryden and others say.  They're just reaping lower profits than 1988 sellers pulled in.  </P> <P> The Schusters, for example, conceded that they sold their Pasadena house at a  profit. They had bought the house 10 years ago for $230,000, and they sold it  for twice that amount.  </P> <P> "We made a good profit on the house," said Schuster. "It's just that it was  $200,000 less than we expected."  </P> <P> Maria DiMassa, an agent with Century 21 Lake Realty in Pasadena, calls that  expectation of maximum profits "the California mentality."  </P> <P> "People think, 'If my neighbor got $200,000 a year ago, I should get $30,000 or  $40,000 more. I deserve it,' " she said.  </P> <P> Barrington-Dryden says money from Asia is still coming into the San Gabriel  Valley real estate market. "I have five escrows (for Asian buyers) right now in  San Marino, South Pasadena and Alhambra," she said.  </P> <P> But like other buyers, Asian investors are becoming more cautious, DiMassa  said.  </P> <P> "Everybody is just waiting a minute," DiMassa said. "The inventory is good,  there are good bargains to be had. There's no rush."  </P> <P> Real estate brokers say the San Gabriel Valley's strengths will pull the region  out of the doldrums sooner than other markets.  </P> <P> There's a plentiful supply of attractive houses in the area; it continues to be  a market of choice for Asian immigrants, and it's closer to Los Angeles than,  for example, the Inland Empire or Antelope Valley, both of which have built up  recently.  </P> <P> As gasoline prices rise, proximity could become the decisive factor, some say.  "When you're paying $1.35 for regular and $1.60 for super, you're going to be  looking closer to reduce that transportation cost," said Berton M. Tibbett,  president of the Pasadena-based Tibbett Group.  </P> <P> The bright side of the picture is the buyer's side.  </P> <P> An Altadena couple who own a dry cleaning business just bought an attractive  house across the street from a golf course.  </P> <P> "We were looking to get into a good neighborhood in a house that would  appreciate over time," said the man, who asked that his name be withheld.  </P> <P> Largely because of the tepid market, the couple was able to bargain the seller  down, from $395,000 to $370,000.  </P> <P> "It's good time to buy, if you can afford to," said the happy buyer.  </P> <P> THE REAL ESTATE SLUMP  </P> <P> Sales within jurisdictions covered by San Gabriel Valley real estate boards  </P> <TABLE CWL="3.87IN:1.78IN:1.78IN:1.89IN" WDM="ABS"

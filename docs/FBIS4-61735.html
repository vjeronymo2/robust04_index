			<p>BFN     [Text] In their two years of existence, Russia's armed  forces have "risen from their knees and are today completely fit  for war," Russian Defense Minister General Pavel Grachev said.    "They can solve problems not only locally but on a wider  scale too," he said in an interview with INTERFAX on Monday,  after a traditional Victory Day ceremony of laying wreaths at  Moscow's Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.    He said several new military districts and defense areas had  been formed. One of them is the Kaliningrad Defense Area, where  the Baltic Fleet commander is in charge of all locally stationed  naval, land and air forces, which thus form a single powerful  military unit, he said.    The North Caucasus Military District is also ready for  combat, and, "by dividing the Volga-Ural Military District into  two separate districts, we made forces deployed in that region  more mobile," Grachev continued. "Apart from that, for the same  purpose in many districts we replaced armies by brigades or  corps. At the moment, the creation of mobile forces and the  replacement of air defense forces with air and space defense  forces is nearly over."    But forces structure in Russia's Far East has remained  unchanged, the minister said. "After a close analysis of all  life and service conditions of the armed forces in that region  we came to the conclusion that we won't change anything. We'll  most likely be able to take the final decision only after some  exercises in the Far Eastern region. Then it'll be clear what  system of armed forces we need in the Far East of Russia," he  said.</p>

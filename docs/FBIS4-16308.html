			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Igor Ivantsov] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 14 TASS -- An extraordinary situation  has formed with power supply in Russia. Strategic reserves of  masout and coal dwindle. Anatoliy Dyakov, president of the  Russian joint-stock company "The Russian Power Grid",  corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, told  ITAR-TASS. The overspending of these kinds of fuel at power  stations made up over 300 thousand tonnes in March and over 116  thousand tonnes in April.    The emergency situation is largely caused by huge  non-payments the power-generating industry, running into 3,600  billion roubles. Being short of funds, the branch ran up a debt  to fuel suppliers, owing about one thousand billion roubles for  gas. Because of this, gas suppliers broke the agreement to  deliver gas to power stations even if there is non-payment. Gas  supplies dropped by over 600 million cubic metres in March.  This resulted in the stoppage of a number of large power plants  at thermal power stations. Half their number use gas for fuel.  The situation has aggravated further because of the drop by  1,250 million kilowatt-hours of electricity at nuclear power  plants, the drop that has not been sanctioned by "The Russian  Power Grid" joint-stock company. Managers of nuclear power  plants explain this by the lack of fuel.    Dyakov said these factors explain the rapid dwindling of  stocks of fuel at power stations. Not even the use of strategic  reserves can fully compensate for gas shortages, he said. Due  to this it is necessary to cut fuel supply to industrial  enterprises in the Transbaikalia, Siberia and Transcaucasia.</p>

			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets: Europe strives to end year with a rally As strategists continued to discuss the threat of higher US interest rates last week, lower domestic interest rates drove the best performers higher in both Europe and Asia. In Europe, with a gain of 3.1 per cent, there was a sense of bourses striving to produce the traditional year-end rally which would allow their clients to close their books happily on December 31. To help them, they had more positive statements concerning the Gatt negotiations, the favourable UK Budget and the round of interest rate cuts triggered by the 0.25 percentage point reduction in the German repurchase rate, said Mr Marcus Grubb, the Salomon Brothers strategist. Austria topped the performance figures with a rise of 4.8 per cent. November was a good month for Vienna money markets, says Mr Frank Jonuschat at Kleinwort Benson, the intervention rate coming down from 6.2 to 5.8 per cent over the month and lifting the banking sector after three months of underperformance. Highly geared utilities such as EVN and Verbund continued to lead the market, says Mr Jonuschat, rising on the effect of lower interest rates on their financing costs and on the benefits both utilities will enjoy from domestic tax reform in Austria, including the abolition of the asset and trade taxes. In Asia, Malaysia's climb of 4.3 per cent took its halcyon year, so far, to a gain of more than 84 per cent in local currency terms. Foreign &amp; Colonial Emerging Markets said last week that Kuala Lumpur continues to be driven by overseas investors, particularly from Japan. It adds that the slight month-on-month rise in Malaysia's CPI caused it little concern, and that banks continue to cut interest rates. F &amp; C, however, has its reservations: 'Given the current stock market strength, it is worth observing that the market capitalisation of the Kuala Lumpur stock exchange is now three times Malaysia's GNP, and is one of the reasons why we are cautious about the market at present.' Meanwhile, at Goldman Sachs, the bank's US economic and strategy teams believe that US long-term interest rates are unlikely to rise on a sustained basis, primarily because growth is likely to slow again and inflation should remain subdued. The London strategy pairing of Mr Sushil Wadhwani and Mr Mushtaq Shah believe global equities have been over-reacting, and that equity market weakness caused by rising rates will prove temporary.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        MARKETS IN PERSPECTIVE  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                   % change    % change                  % change in local currency ??   sterling ??    in US                                                              dollars ??               ----------------------------------------------------------                1 Week  4 Weeks  1 Year  Start of   Start of   Start of                                           1993       1993       1993  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Austria         +4.77    +3.73   +38.66   +35.01    +28.40    +26.41 Belgium         +2.09    +3.46   +27.93   +28.07    +19.48    +17.62 Denmark         +0.99    -1.54   +34.43   +35.70    +27.58    +25.60 Finland         +0.83    -2.86   +91.05   +92.00    +76.54    +73.83 France          +2.66    +4.55   +25.30   +22.05    +15.81    +14.00 Germany         +3.32    +4.62   +37.25   +36.69    +30.69    +28.66 Ireland         +2.74    +1.35   +56.19   +51.05    +33.54    +31.46 Italy           +2.16    -1.01   +39.17   +30.09    +13.66    +11.90 Netherlands     +2.23    +0.53   +36.24   +34.54    +28.86    +26.86 Norway          +0.78    -3.77   +30.79   +32.58    +24.84    +22.90 Spain           +2.61    +1.20   +43.75   +41.91    +16.58    +14.77 Sweden          +1.94    -4.38   +37.02   +31.84    +12.42    +10.67 Switzerland     +2.50    +5.75   +47.99   +36.85    +36.76    +34.63 UK              +3.82    +4.55   +18.87   +15.04    +15.04    +13.26 EUROPE          +3.07    +3.49   +28.96   +25.20    +20.44    +18.56  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Australia       +0.30    -1.27   +39.06   +27.55    +26.18    +24.22 Hong Kong       +0.28    +5.33   +88.95   +71.18    +74.27    +71.56 Japan           +2.47    -7.44   +12.87   +12.49    +31.61    +29.56 Malaysia        +4.32    +4.77   +82.61   +84.36    +91.59    +88.62 New Zealand     +1.40    -4.49   +41.40   +39.20    +51.12    +48.78 Singapore       +3.85    +4.77   +54.83   +46.92    +52.82    +50.45  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Canada          +0.44    +1.91   +22.24   +20.34    +16.96    +15.13 USA             +0.39    +1.21    +7.74    +6.29     +7.98     +6.29 Mexico          +1.86   +12.84   +33.57   +26.87    +29.58    +27.57  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- South Africa    +1.58    +7.07   +38.09   +37.82    +52.82    +50.44  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- WORLD INDEX     +1.70    -0.55   +16.74   +14.75    +19.76    +17.91  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- ??

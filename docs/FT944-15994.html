			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / International Company News: MoDo stake sale MoDo, the Swedish pulp and paper group, said yesterday it had agreed to sell a 25 per cent stake in Slave Lake Pulp Partnership (SLPP) to Canada's Alberta Energy Co (AEC). The disposal, which will give AEC 100 per cent control of the partnership, would generate a SKr200m (Dollars 27m) pre-tax capital gain for the Swedish group. The sale is conditional on AEC going ahead with a plan to float its forest products division, which includes SLPP. SLPP owns a modern pulp mill in Alberta, Canada, with annual capacity of 130,000 tonnes of aspen pulp.

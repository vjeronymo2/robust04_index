			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / FBI and UK police combine: Task force will try to tackle offshore financial crime The Federal Bureau of Investigation in the US and officers from the UK police's New Scotland Yard have joined forces to create a task force aimed at tackling white-collar crime emanating from British offshore territories. The White Collar Criminal Investigations Team was set up in January to investigate fraud and money laundering which affects the British dependent territories in the Caribbean. Two UK officers have been assigned to the FBI's base at Miami, Florida. The move comes as the UK government seeks to encourage its territories to change laws allowing company owners to hide behind nominee names. Such rules make the work of criminal investigators almost impossible. Mr Tony Baldry, a UK Foreign Office minister, is to bring a series of propsoals for discussion with the heads of government of the territories when he visits the Caribbean next month. International business companies, as these shells are called, have been used by money launderers as part of a complex finanical network through which funds cannot be traced. According to one estimate by British intelligence, some Dollars 500bn (Pounds 322bn) may have been 'laundered' worldwide last year. The territories and the UK government have been working together to crack down on criminal activity for some time. However, the territories are particularly sensitive about the rules regarding IBCs, which are substantial revenue earners for such entities as the British Virgin Islands. The creation of the task force is disclosed in a documentary, Dirty Money - Islands of Secrecy, to be screened tonight in Britain on BBC-1 television, describing the role played by offshore centres in financial fraud. More than 60 per cent of the world's money is believed to be held offshore.</p>

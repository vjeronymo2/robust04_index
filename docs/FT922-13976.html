			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / Rafsanjani poised to defeat radical opposition: Careful screening of candidates should leave him in control of parliament THE RUN-UP to Iran's majlis (parliamentary) elections tomorrow has been marked by acrimony and cries of foul play from opponents of President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, who have threatened a boycott on more than one occasion. The elections have given Mr Rafsanjani the opportunity to break the backbone of radicals in their last great stronghold, allowing him to press ahead with measures designed to open up the country to foreign investment and trade. All legislation must pass through the Islamic Republic's 270 seat chamber and some has been held up by the radicals who favour state control of the economy. They also oppose foreign loans and the prevailing open-door foreign policy propounded by the pragmatists, who regard these measures as essential to their own survival and to restoring the country's economy, devastated after Iran's gruelling war against Iraq. Although Mr Rafsanjani has been generally successful in pushing through legislation, the radicals have used the chamber as a public platform to broadcast opposition to his policies. Iran's latest five-year development plan was held up for a year while the radicals argued against a provision allowing borrowing abroad, while last year they succeeded in impeaching Mr Rafsanjani's minster for health, Mr Iraj Fazel. Iran has no formal political parties; instead voters choose from a list of candidates every four years. This year, controversy has centred on the screening process for prospective candidates. Some 1,100 candidates were disqualified from standing from an original list of just over 3,150. The vetting procedure was undertaken by the conservative Council of Guardians, a 12-man body of clerics and legal experts, whose main function is to check that laws passed by the majlis are in accordance with Islamic law. Mr Mehdi Karrubi, the radical majlis speaker, saw the writing on the wall last month when he protested at the fact that the guardians - instead of the Interior Ministry, itself a radical-leaning organisation  - had the final say. 'We plan to take part actively in the elections, he said in an interview reported in the radical newspaper, Salaam. 'But if the Guardian Council wants to start politicking and disrupt the elections by a series of cancellations, maybe we will not take part.' However, the hardline Combatant Clergymen's Society acknowledged last week that it would contest the elections after Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the spiritual leader, directly demanded its participation. At Friday prayers last week, Ayatollah Khamenei warned against 'mischievous elements' and 'those who obstruct the work of officials, those who do not observe piety in their speeches, those who talk in a certain way to attract some votes - such people are not qualified to come to the majlis; they must be identified so that the people do not vote for them.' But Mr Karrubi's protests about the rejection of so many 'distinguished personalities' from the initial candidates' list led to the Council of Guardians reinstating some candidates to its final list. Those radicals who have been dropped for good include Ayatollah Sadeq Khalkhali, known as the 'hanging judge' for his activities in the early years of the revolution, Hojatoleslam Hadi Khamenei, who is Ali Khamenei's brother, Mr Assadollah Bayat, the radical deputy speaker of the majlis and Mr Ibrahim Asgharzadeh, a leader of the students who seized the US embassy in Tehran in 1979. Ayatollah Khalkhali told Salaam newspaper he had been rejected because of his 'clear opposition to US interests in the region'. However, Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati, spokesman of the Council of Guardians said the body had acted in a 'just and legally responsible manner,' and claimed that some candidates had been rejected because of their 'extremely limited literacy' and not because they belonged to any particular faction. In a clear reference to the inadequacy of revolutionary zeal as a sufficient condition for public office, the Iranian news agency, Irna, proudly announced last week that most candidates 'are in their thirties and most hold bachelors and masters degrees. More than 100 have PhD degrees'. However, President Rafsanjani has been careful not to be too provocative and some key radicals, such as the former interior minister, Mr Ali Akbar Mohtashemi and Mr Karrubi have been allowed to stand. Nevertheless, an editorial in Salaam warned of 'an unhealthy and one-sided election'. Despite the differences which have emerged between the radicals and supporters of Mr Rafsanjani, participants in tomorrow's elections are all supporters of the Islamic Republic. Those outside the system are not able to contemplate standing for election. Nine members of a tame opposition group, the Association for the Defence of Freedom and Sovereignty of the Iranian Nation, have been in prison since 1990 when they signed an open letter to Mr Rafsanjani asking for constitutional guarantees of freedom and justice to be implemented. The group is associated with Mr Mehdi Bazargan, the Islamic Republic's first prime minister and a septuagenarian who is in disgrace for being a 'liberal'. On Sunday, Iran launched an air strike against bases of the dissident Mujahideen-e-Khalq, the largest opposition group, located inside Iraq. Mr Massoud Rajavi, leader of the Mujahideen, said the attack was an attempt by Mr Rafsanjani to bolster his popularity in the run-up to the election.</p>

			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / Survey of Logistics (7): Flags of inconvenience - Competition flares in Europe's sea-lanes Most international cargoes make part of their journey by sea but, unless there is a dramatic sinking of a ferry or an oil tanker, seaborne shipping suffers from a very low profile. In recent months, however, a dispute over a rate and capacity sharing agreement or 'conference' across the north Atlantic has focused attention on the financial pressures afflicting parts of the shipping industry. The controversy surrounding the Trans-Atlantic Agreement (TAA) has drawn the European Commission, the shipping industry and large shippers into a bitter dispute. The TAA raises questions about the viability of long-distance, deep-sea routes but the problems confronting short-sea shipping have also come under serious consideration recently. The opportunities for taking consignments off road and rail and transferring them to coastal and canal shipping are being reviewed by the European commission. Shipping owes its low profile in large measure to the shift of the industry away from the traditional but now high-cost European seafaring nations to the Third World and the Far East. With a few notable exceptions ownership has moved to small one or-two vessel companies which sail under 'flags of convenience' and employ non-European crews. Despite these cost-saving measures, competition in many areas of the shipping market has put fierce pressure on the operating margins of shipowners. The traditional method of regulating competition has been the shipping conference, an agreement between competing shipping companies to set prices on a particular route. The TAA was just such an agreement, put in place in September 1992 to stem rising losses on the Europe-North America routes. It united 15 large shipping lines accounting for 85 per cent of sailings on these routes and included companies such as P&amp;O, Nedlloyd and Maersk. The TAA succeeded in pushing up freight rates by as much as 100 per cent. But it enraged many of the companies shipping their products across the Atlantic and prompted the intervention of the European commission. The commission took particular exception to the TAA extending its influence over the land-based section of journeys - to and from the port - and to the fact that it sought to control capacity as well as freight rates. In July the members of the TAA put revised proposals to the commission aimed at making the agreement more flexible and more acceptable to shippers but there is no guarantee that these concessions go far enough. A response from the commission is still awaited. In its role as a defender of free trade and open competition the commission has taken a tough line with the companies involved in the TAA. But within the framework of its transport policies the commission is doing its best to promote the shipping sector. This reflects the importance of shipping to the international movement of goods. More than 90 per cent of the European Union's trade with the rest of the world uses sea transport. This amounts to 600m tonnes of the world's total seaborne trade of 3.6bn tonnes. The EU's international maritime trade is split roughly equally between distant, deep-sea destinations and more 'local' ports of call in Scandinavia, eastern Europe, North Africa and the Middle East. Maritime transport also accounts for a large share - 35 per cent - of total trade between the EU member states. Island nations such as the UK and Ireland are understandably very dependent on seaborne transport but other countries on the EU periphery such as Greece, Portugal and even Denmark move many of their imports and exports by ship. As part of its efforts to revitalise the European shipping fleet, the commission is working on proposals for a European shipping register, Euros. Under an early draft Euros would have still required officers and half the crew to be European nationals but would have given income tax concessions to the crews of Euros-flagged vessels. The tax proposals ran into objections from the national finance ministries, however, and a modified version of this plan is now under consideration. A second strand in the commission's efforts to boost shipping can be found in its proposals to improve the efficiency of ports within the EU. This ports initiative forms part of a broader strategy to create strategic networks of road, rail and air links. Growing pressures on the road network have led to rising levels of congestion and there is little likelihood that investment in roads alone can solve the problem. The inability of road investment to keep up with demand has led to higher energy consumption, more pollution and a greater number of accidents, a commission report concluded. Ports and maritime transport cause less damage to the environment and are more energy efficient. New port infrastructure is normally less intrusive than new road building while the energy consumption of a coastal tanker is four times less per tonne/kilometre than road freight. Under the commission's proposals, financial support would be available for projects defined as being 'of common interest'. An initial trawl has thrown up more than 110 possible projects including the deepening of the approach channel to Esbjerg in Denmark, the construction of quays for a new container terminal in Oslo and improved road connections for ports such as Ramsgate and Southampton. But for all the apparent financial and environmental advantages of ship transport, it will still have a tough task in competing with road and rail shipments. The de-regulation of the road haulage sector to allow cabotage, the carriage of goods between destinations in another country, and the construction of transport links such as the Channel tunnel and Oresund tunnel/bridge between Denmark and Sweden increase the competitiveness of land transport 'The critical success factors such as transit time, frequency of departure, cost of transport and quality of service often do not measure up in comparison with road and sometimes also rail transport,' according to a recent study* by Niko Wijnolst, a Dutch academic. The turnaround time of ships must be reduced dramatically and port and stevedoring costs must be cut if shipborne transport is to become more attractive. Wijnolst calls for the creation of port hopper services, fast and frequent shipping links between European ports, to make maritime transport more attractive. Vessels would need to be equipped to load and unload their own cargoes, dispensing with the delays and cost of shore-based systems. They would also need flexible propulsion units and mooring systems to make them independent of tugs and harbour pilots. Such proposals would require a revolution in working practices in many European ports and a rethink on the level of port dues levied, Wijnolst concedes. Hopper services would also require government assistance. But if these admittedly considerable obstacles could be overcome, maritime transport could play an even greater role in moving goods. *Multimodal Shortsea Transport - Coastal Superhighway. By N.

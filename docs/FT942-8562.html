			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / Eurotunnel failure to raise funds jeopardises rights issue Eurotunnel will be unable to raise much more than Pounds 600m of the Pounds 700m of senior bank debt it requires, according to its principal banking creditors. Its board must therefore decide whether it can launch a Pounds 850m rights issue with less bank finance than planned. 'I simply do not know whether Pounds 600m of senior debt is enough,' said a Eurotunnel director. One company adviser said: 'The banks have got to come up with the extra Pounds 100m.' However, one of the leading bank creditors said: 'The syndicate (of 200 banks) has done what it can. After all, Pounds 600m is a lot of money.' At the moment, banks have provided commitments for slightly more than Pounds 500m, and some of those holding out have indicated that they will make contributions today. The new senior debt would take precedence over all existing debt. Bankers are planning to end their part of the fund-raising exercise early next week, in the hope that the company can make do with less than Pounds 700m. Leading corporate stockbrokers have advised Eurotunnel, however, that underwriting the planned Pounds 850m issue will not be easy and increasing the amount would be extremely difficult. One positive development yesterday was that the required 90 per cent majority vote of the banks has at last been achieved in favour of the refinancing and a change in loan agreements, so that the company will no longer be in breach of its covenants. The official deadline for this vote was on Monday. Eurotunnel runs out of cash next month. It needs to receive the necessary funding from its banks by early next week, so that it can complete its rights issue before the French holiday season begins in July. Fund managers said valuing the shares was difficult given that the company will not be generating enough cash to cover interest payments until 1998 and paying nodividend until 2003.

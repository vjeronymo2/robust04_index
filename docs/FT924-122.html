			<p>921230 FT  30 DEC 92 / Money Markets: Futures rise sharply THERE were sharp rises in currency futures across Europe yesterday, as dealers continued to take the view that interest rates in Germany could come down earlier than expected, writes James Blitz. In sterling markets, dealers ignored the signs of economic recovery in the high street, and continued to believe that the government would introduce another cut in base rates before March. Trading in all markets continued to be thin because of the holiday season, but there was an upbeat tone everywhere. On the German cash market, call money was little changed at 8.80-8.85 per cent, despite the Bundesbank's unexpected decision to drain DM8.8bn from the money market in its weekly securities repurchase operation. The draining ran counter to forecasts of an allocation to match the DM57.1bn in expiring funds, but dealers said that the lower injection had not upset the market. Short-dated Euromark futures continued the upward progress that characterised the approach to Christmas. The March contract rose 5 basis points to close at 92.24, while the June contract was up 7 basis points to a close of 93.01. At these levels, the market assumes that 3-month D-Marks will be some 180 points cheaper over the next 6 months. However, some dealers continue to take an extremely pessimistic view of the possibility of German policy being eased, at least before March. French futures reflected the calmer atmosphere. The March contract closed up 11 basis points at 91.89 and the June contract up 10 basis points at 91.95. In the sterling market, dealers might have been expected to take a more bearish view, following reports that there had been a surge of high street shopping shortly before Christmas. However, the futures market continued to think there would be another 50 basis point cut in base rates before the spring. The March short sterling contract rose 10 basis points to close at 93.42, a level which assumes that 3 month money will be at 6.58 per cent within 3 months. Dealing in the cash market was not as bullish. Three month money closed slightly softer yesterday at 7 1/16 per cent from about 7 1/8 per cent. The 1 year rate was also  1/16 per cent softer at about 6 7/8 per cent.</p>

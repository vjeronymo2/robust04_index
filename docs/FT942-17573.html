			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Redland strong Building materials group Redland was one of the best performing stocks among FT-SE 100 constituents after analysts upgraded profit expectations following the release of better than anticipated full-year figures. The group reported profits of Pounds 278.9m, against a range of forecasts between Pounds 260m and Pounds 270m, with the results followed by a bullish presentation from the board. At the day's best, the shares were up 25 but came off the top with the market to finish 15 up 539p on balance, after hefty trade of 7.3m. Mr Simon Brown at Strauss Turnbull raised his forecast by Pounds 10m to Pounds 335m and believes the stock to be undervalued, 'given the Steetley acquisition two years ago together with the high quality of the assets and the management.' Mr Mike Betts at Goldman Sachs, who has been negative on the stock over the last few months, raised his estimate by Pounds 23m to Pounds 328m and moved the stock from a sell to a hold recommendation. He said: 'The stock will perform well in a weak market as the yield will underpin the shares.' Media and publishing group Pearson retreated sharply after announcing an agreed Dollars 462m offer for Software Toolworks, a US software publisher. Some analysts expressed concern over both the price being paid and the strategic logic of the move. Pearson shares slippped by 26 to 641p, the biggest faller in the FT-SE 100. There was other takeover activity in the media sector. Capital Radio set the radio broadcasting sector alight with the Pounds 32.8m agreed offer for Southern Radio. Capital shares jumped 21 to 418p, while Southern surged 25 to 118p, 3p above the offer price. The move excited other radio shares, with Chiltern gaining 11 to 163p, GWR Group 37 to 895p and Metro Radio 10 to 349p. Advertising agency Saatchi &amp; Saatchi appeared to have resolved its boardroom differences with a statement that the chief executive and chairman would both be keeping their current roles. The shares responded by slipping a half-penny to 135 1/2 p, with one analyst commenting that the deal failed to resolve the problem over the future direction of the company. Software group Unipalm made its expected strong debut, the shares coming to the market at 100p and finishing the day at 136p. Capital Shopping, the property group which came to the market on Wednesday at 230p, had another weak day along with the sliding sentiment in the the sector. The shares slipped a further 2 to 206p and gave rise to fears for other forthcoming property flotations, which were priced prior to the sector's recent bout of weakness. Rugby Estates is rumoured to have had its original issue price cut by some 30 per cent prior to coming to the market the week after next. A weak performance overnight by Wall Street impacted on several stocks. Reuters fell back 26 to 1960p, Glaxo was off 10 before recovering to close a net 4 off 600p, and ICI fell 18 to 789p. Firm gilts, continued hopes of a rate cut and positive sentiment over early payment of bills by consumers avoiding VAT helped the electricity sector. Among the better performers, Eastern gained 14 to 675p, Yorkshire 13 to 651p and Manweb 16 to 738p. Great Universal Stores continued to attract attention, the shares gaining 16 to 607p. There are rumours that the company is planning to spend a Pounds 1bn buying back a chunk of its shares. Kingfisher was again buoyed by this week's buying recommendations from several brokers and the shares added 8 to 577p. At the start of the busy Easter period for DIY groups, WH Smith gained 12 to 533p on hopes for its restructuring proposals for Do It All, due after the break. Nervous trading in British Airways ahead of US committal proceedings instigated by Virgin Atlantic, left the shares trailing 8 1/2 to 404 1/2 p, after trade of 3.4m. Aero-engine group Rolls-Royce recovered from recent weakness gaining 6 1/2 to 181 1/2 , on volume of 7.2m. Also recovering was Inchcape, which reported poor figures earlier this week. The shares put on 2 to 515p. Taylor Woodrow continued to benefit from its recent favourable figures and the shares put on another 5 to 159p. The rest of the building materials stocks followed the market lower. Hepworths shed 15 to 391p, while Harrisons &amp; Crosfield lost 8 to 197p, following a cautious note from NatWest Securities. Building products and security printing group Caradon which reported improved figures earlier this week, was also the subject of a cautious note from NatWest Securities. The shares fell 11 to 363p. after NatWest said that ' ..we would prefer to rate RMC, Marley, Rugby and Blue Circle more highly since they have owned for some time the operations that will deliver the anticipated performance.'</p>

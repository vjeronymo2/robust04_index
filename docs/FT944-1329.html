			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / 'Output gap' leads to inflation alert: Gillian Tett reports on OECD findings that could fuel the debate on the timing of interest rate rises The strong growth in the US has now eroded all of the spare capacity in the US economy, suggesting that inflationary pressures may soon intensify, the OECD outlook said yesterday. Germany also has a relatively low level of spare capacity in its economy, even though recovery has started only recently there. However, the UK has more spare capacity than any other of the six largest industrialised economy, closely followed by France. These findings are likely to fuel the debate about the timing of interest rate rises in OECD countries and the significance of the so-called 'output gap', not least because the OECD yesterday announced reforms in its calculations of this gap. In recent years, western governments have attached growing significance to the concept of an output gap, since it has been assumed that an erosion of the spare capacity will lead to higher inflation, The output gap is usually defined as the difference between the actual growth rate in an economy and its theoretical potential growth rate if all capacity were used. However, economists and governments have remained sharply divided over the correct way to measure the output gap. Although the Bank of England, for example, uses its own calculations of the UK output gap to help determine the timing of interest rate rises, it refuses to publish figures on this. In the past, the OECD's own calculations of the output gap have relied on a mixture of historical statistical analysis, and judgements about broader trends in the economy, such as changes in labour market flexibility. However the OECD is now relying on a more complicated modelling technique that seeks to estimate the total productive capacity in an economy, compared with its actual growth. The OECD admits that the concept remains extremely slippery. Nevertheless, its finding that the US economy has now eroded all of its spare capacity may add to pressure for a further rise in US interest rates. 'There is widespread agreement that full employment has been reached (in the US),' the OECD said. It forecasts that inflation in the US will rise to more than 3 per cent in the next 18 months. Conversely, the surprising conclusion that the UK now has more spare capacity than most other European countries not only highlights the depth of the recent UK recession - but may also fuel complaints from some economists that further rises in UK interest rates are unnecessary. France is also estimated to have a relatively large output gap, which again may indicate the depth of its recent recession. Meanwhile the output gap in Japan, which is only now emerging from recession, is predicted to remain little changed over the next two years, highlighting the fact that inflationary pressures are likely to remain subdued, creating little need for interest rate rises. The OECD warned that Italy, in particular, was one country that needed to address the problem of the budget deficit, although the Italian government had introduced some reforms.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                OUTPUT GAPS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------            Deviations of actual GDP from potential GDP as                      percentage of potential GDP  ----------------------------------------------------------------------             US      Japan     Germany   France    Italy   UK    Canada  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 1986      -0.4      -3.8       -1.3      -2.2      0.1    0.5     1.0 1987       0.2      -3.8       -1.8      -2.3      1.5    2.8     2.6 1988       1.7      -1.2       -0.5      -0.5      2.9    5.0     4.6 1989       2.2       0.1        0.2       1.1      4.0    4.6     4.0 1990       1.4       1.8        2.3       1.2      3.7    2.2     0.8 1991      -1.4       3.1        3.8      -0.2      2.6   -2.5    -3.5 1992      -1.3       2.0        2.5      -1.0      0.8   -5.1    -4.8 1993      -0.4      -0.2       -1.2      -3.7     -2.1   -5.2    -4.4 1994       1.0      -2.3       -1.2      -3.5     -2.0   -3.9    -2.9 1995       1.5      -2.8       -1.1      -2.6     -1.4   -2.9    -1.7 1996       1.0      -2.5       -0.5      -1.6     -0.7   -2.3    -0.8  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

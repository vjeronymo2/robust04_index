			<p>940829 FT  29 AUG 94 / Emerging Markets: News round-up - Mexico Mexico's stockmarket rose a modest 2.4 per cent last week following the ruling party's easy win in Sunday's presidential election, although the peso unexpectedly weakened against the dollar, writes Damian Fraser in Mexico City. The market reaction was limited largely because investors had already discounted the victory of Mr Ernesto Zedillo. The leftist opposition's decision to denounce the election as fraudulent and to hold a protest rally on Saturday in Mexico City, while expected, appears to have made some investors nervous. After strengthening sharply the day after the election, the peso weakened in the second half of the week after the central bank moved its informal intervention limit up to 3.25 pesos to the dollar to prevent a sudden appreciation of the currency.</p>

			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Kode forced to make further dividend cut Kode International, electronics and computer services group, reported a slight downturn in profits for the year to December 31. Operating profits were 8 per cent up from Pounds 561,000 to Pounds 608,000, with turnover marginally lower at Pounds 15.7m compared with Pounds 16m. But a rise from Pounds 57,000 to Pounds 122,000 in exceptional items, mainly redundancy and compensation payments, left pre-tax profits down from Pounds 504,000 to Pounds 486,000. After tax of Pounds 137,000 (Pounds 163,000), earnings per share came to 4.3p (5.8p). The proposed final dividend is cut from 5p to 3p following the 1.5p cut in the interim, to make the total payment of 4p, against 7.5p.</p>

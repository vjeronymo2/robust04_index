			<p><P> July 9, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAVVY COMPROMISE  </P> <P> The idea of environmental groups accepting a cash settlement from developers in  return for dropping a lawsuit is an unsettling. one.  </P> <P> The Sierra Club has such a lofty reputation that few people question its  motives or ideals, even when they disagree with its positions.  </P> <P> So it came as quite a shock to many that the Sierra Club and San Diegans for  Managed Growth were considering a settlement of $500,000 or more from two  developers whose projects were possibly jeopardized by a lawsuit the groups had  filed against the city.  </P> <P> The groups said they planned to use the money to set up a foundation, which  could intervene in future cases to protect sensitive lands and the city's urban  reserve.  </P> <P> Disclosure of the negotiations brought on a furor of criticism from builders  and politicians. Mayor Maureen O'Connor accused the environmental groups of  selling out. Builders, afraid of setting a precedent, pressured the two  developers to back off from a settlement that would have given  environmentalists the freedom to decide how the money would be spent.  </P> <P> At issue in the suit is whether the City Council improperly gave the developers  permission to build on 320 acres in the city's northern tier, land that the  environmentalists claim cannot be developed without voter approval. The  environmentalists lost the first round when a judge said the statute of  limitations had been exceeded, a ruling they are appealing. The developers,  hoping to speed resolution of the case, offered the groups a settlement.  </P> <P> Settling lawsuits out of court is an everyday occurrence in most legal circles.  Each side weighs the chances of winning and the costs and risks of continuing a  case. Practicality often prevails over principles.  </P> <P> Environmentalists and other public-interest groups face the same legal hurdles  as other litigants. But they wage their battles mostly with volunteers, while  their adversaries are often financial Goliaths.  </P> <P> So, perhaps even more than other plaintiffs, public-interest groups have to  temper idealism with realism. They do this when they decide whether to file a  suit, when they decide how much money and volunteer time to devote to the suit  and whether to appeal.  </P> <P> It would be unreasonable to expect them to refuse all settlements, which are  fairly rare and probably should be if public-interest groups want to maintain  the public's trust.  </P> <P> But, in some cases, settling might provide the funds to allow public-interest  groups to better succeed with future efforts.  </P> <P> Settling doesn't necessarily mean selling out; it may just be smart strategy.  And, in San Diego, where most elected officials tend to favor development,  environmentalists need to be smart.  </P></p>

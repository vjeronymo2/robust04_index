			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / Battle to hold the middle lane: Quentin Peel examines the challenges ahead for Chancellor Helmut Kohl's coalition government In the small hours of Germany's Monday morning, any normal political animal would have been wide awake, frantically following every last election return to determine the fate of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government. Computer predictions put his overall majority at two seats, a cliff-hanging result well within any normal margin of error. Only three-quarters of the seats were counted by midnight, and most of the remainder were in unpredictable territory in east Germany. On the face of it, it could have gone either way. But in Bonn, at midnight, most German political animals were in bed. In the first place, Mr Kohl had said he had won, so they believed it. Indeed, Mr Rudolf Scharping, the leader of the opposition Social Democratic Party (SPD), had virtually admitted defeat. And secondly, they knew that even a two-vote majority would not necessarily spell chaos and instability in the German political system. Long past bedtime, it emerged that the chancellor's conservative-liberal coalition had actually survived with a 10-seat majority, a dramatic drop from its lead of 134 in the outgoing parliament, but, in Mr Kohl's words, 'a perfectly good working majority'. Yesterday, the markets took it all in their stride. The Frankfurt stock exchange put on an initial 2 per cent, before falling back later in the day in 'muted' trade. The bond market was up. The atmosphere was relaxed. But the political establishment was split down the middle over whether the current coalition would survive its full four-year term. 'They won't even last a year,' Mr Rudolf Dressler, social affairs spokesman of the SPD, said yesterday. 'There is no reason why they shouldn't survive a full term,' said Mr Klaus Beck, head of the Bonn liaison office of the trade union federation. Everyone accepts that a tiny majority is not in itself a disaster. Former Chancellor Helmut Schmidt survived with a 10-seat majority from 1976-1980, and his predecessor, Mr Willy Brandt, had a 12-seat margin from 1969-1972. The government of the north German state of Schleswig-Holstein has been in power with a one-seat majority since 1992. There are no mid-term by-elections, and German governments are anyway slow-moving, consensus-based creatures, which avoid conflicts at all costs. The trouble for Mr Kohl is that his coalition contains political strains which have been under pressure for several years and the finely-balanced election result could just bring them to breaking point. And the government agenda in the coming four years is certain to include some issues that could provide the material for deep divisions. For a start, it must tackle the question of tax reform, of both income tax, which is the chancellor's priority, and company tax. Another key question is the soaring cost of the welfare state, and how to control it. Privatisation and deregulation are also potentially divisive issues for the members of the coalition. And so is the need to take tougher action to enforce law and order, and cope with organised crime. Only foreign policy looks to be an area of relative harmony. Everything depends on the highly unpredictable Free Democratic Party (FDP), the liberal minority partner in the ruling coalition, and the big loser in Sunday's general election. It emerged from the poll with just 47 members in the 672-seat Bundestag, compared with 79 in the previous parliament. But it still holds the balance of power between Mr Kohl's Christian Democrats and the opposition SPD. The party, led by Mr Klaus Kinkel, the foreign minister, has fought a string of disastrous election campaigns during the year, losing all its seats in 10 state parliaments, and in the European parliament, because it failed to get more than the required 5 per cent minimum share of the vote. In east Germany, in particular, its philosophy of free market liberalism has failed to find any response. It scraped into the Bundestag on Sunday night, largely thanks to votes transferred by CDU supporters. People who said they voted FDP as they emerged from the polling stations were asked which party they really favoured. No fewer than 63 per cent said CDU, compared with only 16 per cent for the FDP itself. The FDP is now the smallest member of the coalition - the Bavaria-based Christian Social Union (CSU) has 50 seats. Yet the irony is that it is more politically powerful, because of the paper-thin majority, than it was over the past four years. Mr Kinkel is totally committed to the current coalition. He fought the entire election on that basis. But he knows that over the next four years he has to win a clear political profile for his own party if it is to survive the next election at all. The FDP has to take a clear, independent position on issues. The question is whether it can best do that within the ruling coalition, or outside it. On tax reform, the FDP, the CDU and the CSU are not too far apart, although the FDP is clearly more radical in the reduction it would wish to see in company tax. It is also more potentially radical on deregulation and privatisation. A big issue for Mr Gunter Rexrodt, the economics minister, has been the need to make the energy market more competitive, and another has been to deregulate the retail sector - both issues on which he has met solid opposition from the more conservative CDU/CSU. But the most potentially contentious area is social spending cuts, where the FDP is also more radical than its more powerful partners. 'The dilemma of the FDP is that they will be tempted to try to get more profile by being in the forefront of moves to deregulation and to slim the welfare state,' according to one top political adviser. 'But they know first of all that the CDU is much more cautious. And Mr Kohl knows that these are issues on which he needs the support of the Bundesrat (the second house of parliament representing the 16 federal states). The Bundesrat has an SPD majority, and on such issues, he will never get that support. So he has to resist the FDP.' Social spending issues nearly brought disaster during the past four years, first over reform of the health service, and then over setting up a new insurance scheme to finance nursing care for the old and handicapped. The FDP backed down, but next time, it might decide not to. The other key area of contention could be law and order, for the FDP still contains a strong libertarian wing, committed to generous immigration policies, good race relations, and a determined resistance to police surveillance, such as bugging telephone lines. Mr Kohl will be pushing for tougher action on law and order, to fulfil his election promises. Only on Europe are the coalition members in broad agreement, although Mr Kohl is perhaps more passionate about the need for further European integration. But any of those issues could be the one the FDP chooses to use to seek a new profile, if the party leadership decides that is the best strategy. Mr Kohl, on the other hand, will bend over backwards to keep his coalition together. He knows that the alternative - a grand coalition with the SPD - was a disaster for his party before, when it paved the way for a change of power to an SPD-FDP alliance. He will thus seek to accommodate the liberals, within the limits of his need to work with the SPD majority in the Bundesrat. That is where a de facto grand coalition already exists. That is perhaps why the German body politic, and the financial markets, can afford to be so relaxed about such a close election result. But it still leaves the future clouded by uncertainty, and the fate of Mr Kohl in the hands of his unreliable partner, Mr Kinkel.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, April 27 (AFP) -- The United Nations said  Wednesday [27 April] it was against moving Gorazde residents out  of the Moslem enclave, which has been overrun by Serb troops.  "Our view is that the refugee population of Gorazde should be  allowed to return to their villages" in the pocket, said the  United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees spokesman in  Sarajevo, Peter Kessler. "For the moment there has been no  official suggestion of a forced displacement of population," he  said. UN Protection Force spokesman Eric Chaperon said the idea  of a movement of population was an "unfounded rumour."    Earlier several humanitarian sources said a movement of up  to  20,000 refugees in the Gorazde pocket was being discussed.    "We know that discussions are under way to open up a passage  through Serb-controlled territory for refugees from Gorazde,"  one said on condition of anonymity. "They are talking about up  to 20,000 people, crossing the mountains on foot, within the  next two weeks," the source said.    UN officials say two-thirds of the Gorazde enclave's  territory is occupied by Bosnian Serb troops who have imposed a  stranglehold after a fierce offensive that began in late March.  The town of Gorazde itself swelled with Moslem refugees. Serb  forces pulled heavy weapons outside an exclusion zone Wednesday  under threat of NATO air strikes, and the fighting has largely  subsided. But Kessler said the enclave's civilian population  was going to need "a permanent life support system" as the Serbs  appear bent on making the region unlivable for the Moslems. He  said one example of this was the Serbs' destruction of Gorazde's  water processing plant as they pulled out of the town over the  weekend. Humanitarian sources said that Serb psychological  pressure on the Moslem population was such that many would  accept an opportunity to leave.    A similar idea was floated last April at Srebrenica in  eastern Bosnia after Serb forces succeeded in eliminating the  enclave's defences, but local authorities opposed the move,  saying it would aid the Serb campaign of "ethnic cleansing."    The Bosnian government has consistently opposed forced  movements of population.</p>

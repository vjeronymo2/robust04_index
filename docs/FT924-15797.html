			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Harmony EGM sought A GROUP of dissident shareholders in Harmony Leisure, the loss-making pubs and restaurant group, yesterday announced moves to oust the board at an extraordinary meeting. The rebel group, led by Mr Andrew Martyr, a former hotel executive, claims that more than 30 per cent of shareholders back their call for an EGM. Mr Martyr has told shareholders that the dissidents, if elected, would return Harmony to profit and raise capital to expand the chain of 23 pubs and restaurants. The USM-quoted company lost Pounds 1.04m in the year to March 31 1991 and Pounds 445,000 in the following six months. It said yesterday that its 1991-92 results, due earlier this week, would be released on Tuesday and an annual meeting would be held next month. Mr Martyr's team includes Mr Simon Lynch, formerly with Grand Metropolitan; Mr Ronald Laden, former chairman of Quaker Oats (Europe); and Mr Simon Smith, a London solicitor. Since announcing their challenge last month, the rebels have acquired 520,000 shares, 2 per cent of Harmony's capital.</p>

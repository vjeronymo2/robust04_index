			<p><P> November 30, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TOP TAILBACK LEAVES IRVINE FOR TUSTIN  </P> <P> Shad Vickers, one of the top running backs in the South Coast League, has  transferred from Irvine High School to Tustin. He will be eligible to compete  on the school's track team this spring and on the football team next fall.  </P> <P> Vickers, a 5-foot-10, 170-pound junior, rushed for 787 yards and six touchdowns  for Irvine this season after moving from wide receiver. As a sophomore, he  caught 16 passes for 302 yards.  </P> <P> Vickers moved to running back in Irvine's final game against El Toro as a  sophomore and rushed for 158 yards in a 27-26 loss.  </P> <P> Vickers finished third in the 330-yard low hurdles in the league finals as a  sophomore and is expected to be among the top competitors in the event this  spring.  </P> <P> "He enrolled on Monday and was in our sixth-period football class that day,"  Tustin Coach Marijon Ancich said. "I guarantee you, he's one of the fastest  guys around."  </P> <P> Irvine Coach Terry Henigan said he learned that Vickers was leaving Irvine  before the Thanksgiving holiday, but did not speak to him before he left.  </P> <P> "He's living with his grandfather, who is his legal guardian," Henigan said. "I  wasn't surprised that he left. I wish the best for him. He's been a super  two-year starter for us who competes as hard as anyone I've coached.  </P> <P> "You never like to lose a player like Shad. He's a tough kid who plays hard."  </P></p>

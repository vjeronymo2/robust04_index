			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report: "Zheng Guoxiong Says Only When the British Side </F> Withdraws Patten's Proposal Can China and Britain Resume Talks"]    [Text] In response to the recent British statements  calling for continued talks with the Chinese side, Zheng  Guoxing, deputy director of the Hong Kong branch of XINHUA,  pointed out yesterday that Chris Patten's recent performances in  London, as well as the results of the British Cabinet meeting,  did not carry new meaning and that the Sino-British talks had  been totally disrupted by the British side. Only when the  British side displays sincerity by practical action and  withdraws the partial constitutional reform bill which had been  submitted to the Legislative Council [Legco], will it be  possible for China and Britain to resume talks on the  arrangements for the 1994/95 elections in Hong Kong through  diplomatic consultations.    Zheng made the aforesaid remarks when attending a public  occasion at the Chinese University of Hong Kong yesterday  morning. He pointed out: The fact that the British side has  submitted the partial constitutional reform bill to Legco means  that the talks have broken down and that the basis for  Sino-British cooperation has been disrupted by the British side.    The British side should clearly understand the Chinese  side's  stand, that only by withdrawing the partial constitutional  reform bill submitted to Legco can the British side prove its  sincerity. If the British side is really sincere about the  talks, they are clear about what to do.    Zheng said: The Sino-British talks have broken down because  the British side unilaterally announced the suspension of  negotiations at the 17th round of the talks and later submitted  the partial constitutional reform bill to Legco. Given that the  British side has gone farther on the road of noncooperation and  has seriously affected the stable transition of Hong Kong, the  Chinese side must speed up the work of the Preliminary Work  Committee and rely on Hong Kong residents in making good  preparations in all fields in line with the provisions of the  Basic Law in order to achieve a stable transition.    Zheng also pointed out: Given that no agreement is reached  between China and Britain, the three-tier councils of the  British Hong Kong Government will only serve until 30 June 1997.  The future special administration region government will  reorganize Hong Kong's three-tier councils according to the  Basic Law.    A reporter asked: "Recently the Hong Kong Government again  applied to Legco for an appropriation of 4.6 billion Hong Kong  dollars for the airport project. What is your view on this?"    Zheng said: "The British move is out of keeping with the  memorandum of understanding [MOU]. In fact, no sooner had the  memorandum been signed than the British side put forward a  financial arrangement in violation of the memorandum. It was  stipulated in the MOU that debts should not exceed HK$5 billion,  but the British side put forward a financial arrangement that  incurred well over HK$5 billion in debt. This means that the  future special administrative region government should assume a  heavy debt. As this will directly affect the interests and life  quality of the vast numbers of Hong Kong residents, it is  naturally unacceptable to us. Recently the Chinese side put  forward some proposals, but the British side has made no  response. The British side is now adopting an attitude of  ignoring the Chinese side's view and is submitting the airport  project to Legco piecemeal. This is also unacceptable to us for  it is not conducive to the solution of the issue on airport  financial arrangements. The key to solving the airport issue  lies in the British Hong Kong authorities truly acting according  to the MOU on the airport project. This is not something  difficult to solve."</p>

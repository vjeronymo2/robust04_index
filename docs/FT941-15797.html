Which means that today's programme (10.20 BBC1) will be unique. We shall see. BBC2 begins a magazine series, Big Science (8.00). Each half hour programme will contain three items.

The final programme in Peter Taylor's States Of Terror series investigates how Army intelligence and MI5 plant agents in Northern Ireland's terrorist groups (9.30 BBC1). In Trial And Error David Jessel investigates another alleged miscarriage of justice: the case of Gary Mills and Tony Poole who were convicted in 1989 of murder (9.00 C4).</p>

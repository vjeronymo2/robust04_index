			<p><P> June 16, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FACES . . . : ANOTHER DIMENSION FOR MARILYN MCCOO  </P> <P> Yes, Marilyn McCoo is still married to Billy Davis Jr.  </P> <P> "Isn't that funny? Still, people wonder," the singer says of her 20-year  marriage, which remains strong despite a professional split-up. "Ever since I  hosted 'Solid Gold,' Billy and I have been trying to convince people we're  still married."  </P> <P> McCoo is probably best remembered as one fifth of the pop group the Fifth  Dimension -- or half of Marilyn McCoo and Billy Davis Jr., whose "You Don't  Have to Be a Star (To Be in My Show)" remains a '70s classic. Since then,  though, McCoo has been the star of quite a few shows -- as host of "Solid Gold"  in the mid-'80s and headlining in Las Vegas and Lake Tahoe. Most recently,  McCoo made her theatrical debut as Aldonza in "Man of La Mancha" at the  Pasadena Civic Auditorium.  </P> <P> McCoo, who plays opposite Ken Howard, says being in a musical is a lot  different than doing a Vegas show. "I'm used to being the one in charge," she  explains. "Here, it's a matter of giving up control. I have no control over  whether the whole play succeeds." But, she adds, "One can't forget that one is  not totally in control all of the time."  </P> <P> "Being in a play makes you more sensitive to the input of the people around  you," McCoo continues. "To derive maximum value from them, you have to make  sure not to get in their way" -- a lesson she will use after the play closes  June 24, when she goes back to her solo act.  </P> <P> McCoo's decision to work without her husband was a mutual decision, she says.  "Performing with a group was very fulfilling in many ways, but I didn't want to  look back on my life and say, 'Yeah, I had fun doing this, but I wish I had  done that.' "  </P> <P> As for Davis, he is currently working on some songs of his own. "If there is an  album, we will have a duet," McCoo says. "We promised each other that if we  worked separately, we'd always have guest performances on each other's albums."  LAUREN LIPTON  </P></p>

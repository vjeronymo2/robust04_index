			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / International Company News: Dublin approves Aer Lingus rescue plan AER LINGUS, the Irish state airline, last night received the government approval for its rescue plan which includes the shedding of more than 25 per cent of the 5,500 workforce and open up the possibility of direct transatlantic flights between Dublin and the United States. The cabinet finally gave clearance to the plan despite last-ditch efforts by the airline's trade unions and supporters of the so-called Shannon stopover to have it extensively modified. Mr Brian Cowan, the transport minister, told the Dail (parliament) that the airline was facing unprecedented losses and that time was running out to save it. This year, the air transport division is expected to loseIPounds 64m (Pounds 61m) after registering a loss of IPounds 50m last year. The government has promised a capital injection of IPounds 175m over the next three years conditional on union acceptance of the rescue plan. Mr Bernie Cahill, executive chairman, last night called upon unions to 'respond positively' to the plan, adding: 'The alternative would be to witness the inexorable decline of Aer Lingus.' Mr Paul O'Sullivan, the main representative of the trade unions, said, however, that he was extremely disappointed by the government's endorsement. Business leaders in the Shannon region of the west of Ireland also expressed anger at the decision claiming that the ending of the Shannon stopover will have a severe adverse economic impact on the area. For the first time direct flights will now become possible between Dublin and the US, which should attract new carriers to the route. Mr Cowan said he would open talks shortly with the US aviation authorities to negotiate a new bilateral agreement covering air transport between the US and the republic. Aer Lingus at present carries about 500,000 passengers a year across the Atlantic.</p>

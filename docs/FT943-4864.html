			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / Ford and Vauxhall lose market share Ford and Vauxhall, the leaders of the UK market for new cars, both lost market share during August, the most important month for sales of new cars, as did most Japanese carmakers. The biggest gains were achieved by Mercedes-Benz, the German executive and luxury carmaker, and Honda of Japan. Both increased sales volumes by more than 60 per cent year-on-year in an overall market where registrations rose by only 2.8 per cent. Fiat of Italy and the Volkswagen group of Germany, which includes Audi, Seat and Skoda, also gained ground, as sales of imported cars rose strongly to account for 60.2 per cent of August sales compared with a share of 58.3 per cent a year ago. Japanese carmakers, with the exception of Honda and Subaru, all suffered sales declines in August with their price competitiveness under heavy pressure from the appreciation of the yen. The Volkswagen group, whose fortunes have wavered in the UK market in recent years, is regaining lost ground supported by significant price cuts during the past year for its VW and Audi brands. Sales of the VW brand in August rose by 27.3 per cent year-on-year. Seat, the group's Spanish subsidiary, increased its registrations by 52.3 per cent, helped by the launch of the Ibiza and Cordoba small-car ranges. Sales to private buyers, which in previous months had been running 10 per cent higher than the previous year, fell by 4.4 per cent year-on-year in August to 268,298. In the first eight months sales to private buyers rose by 4.2 per cent to 730,830.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- UK NEW CAR REGISTRATIONS - JANUARY-AUGUST

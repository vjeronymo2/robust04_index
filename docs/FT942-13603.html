			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / Books: Hong Kong through a mandarin's eyes - An account of the Sino-British pact EXPERIENCES OF CHINA by Percy Cradock John Murray Pounds 19.99, 276 pages It is rare in Britain for senior civil servants to publish their memoirs. In the past decade, Clive Ponting, a former senior defence department official, wrote a book after he blew the whistle on the sinking of the Belgrano in the Falklands War and fought off a government attempt to convict him under the Official Secrets Act. Now, for reasons more to do with reputation than conscience, a most unlikely and considerably more senior Whitehall figure joins ranks with Ponting. He is Sir Percy Cradock, adviser to two prime ministers on foreign affairs, head of Britain's secret intelligence community for most of the 1980s, and former ambassador to China and East Germany. Sir Percy - who retired from the civil service in May 1992 - first flickered across the consciousness of the British public in December that year when he appeared on the BBC's Newsnight programme to denounce British policy on Hong Kong. There he vigorously criticised Chris Patten, the colony's governor, for embarking on confrontation with China and in so doing changing the policy of accommodating China which he, Sir Percy, had devised a decade earlier when he was still our ambassador at Beijing. What brought this man from the background to the foreground of public life and onto the nation's television screens was the accusation, published in The Times, that British policy pre-Patten had been pusillanimous. Sir Percy was the architect of that policy. It was his hand that guided negotiations which culminated in 1984 with the signing of the Sino-British Joint Declaration - a treaty in which China undertook to preserve Hong Kong's way of life for 50 years after 1997, the year of the hand over. Experiences of China, thinly disguised as a memoir, is his defence of that strategy and of subsequent British policy until his retirement. As a memoir it is almost wholly unrevealing of the author, except for his inability to disguise a certain fussy, 'mother knows best' intolerance of those who do not share his views. The first 158 pages concern Sir Percy's career in China as a British diplomat during the 1960s and 1970s. Interesting to his colleagues as they may be, they add little to our understanding of China under either Mao or Deng that could not be found elsewhere. It is, however, the last 100 pages for which Sir Percy will be remembered. Until 2009, when the documents of the period will begin to become available, this is likely to remain the only first hand account of Britain's Hong Kong diplomacy by so central a participant. This diplomacy began in 1979 with the trip to Beijing - when Cradock was ambassador - by Sir Murray MacLehose, Hong Kong's then governor, where the issue of Hong Kong was first raised formally; to the author's last official trip to the Chinese capital on the eve of his retirement as foreign policy adviser in May 1992. The main argument supporting this narrative is that the lease covering 98 per cent of Hong Kong's territory was due to expire on June 30 1997, making the continuance of British rule of the remaining 2 per cent untenable. Furthermore, Britain, which had used military power to wrest Hong Kong from a decaying imperial China 150 years before, did not possess the power to retain its colony in the face of resurgent and unified Communist China. The policies pursued - characterised by 'patient private negotiation' - produced the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration, and, after the Tiananmen massacre of June 1989, agreements to increase democracy in Hong Kong and secure a new airport. As befits a former Cambridge law don, Sir Percy argues his case persuasively. But in the end he fails to convince. The devil resides in the detail and no more so than in the case of Hong Kong's transfer to China. Sir Percy manages (to use the Foreign Office's favourite verb) to elide the most awkward parts of the story. In particular he avoids dealing with the uncomfortable fact that Britain conceded to China the interpretation of the Joint Declaration as soon as it had negotiated the treaty. This is certainly the case where Hong Kong's political development is concerned - the weakest part of the Joint Declaration. Sir Percy and Governor Sir David Wilson simply accepted Peking's diktat on what constituted 'convergence'. This amounted to doing nothing to Hong Kong's political structure with which the Chinese might disagree. It 'was recognised at the time that there was no point, and much danger, in developments that would be abruptly terminated on 1 July 1997,' Sir Percy writes. Recognised by whom? Certainly not much of Hong Kong opinion. After the signing of the Joint Declaration Hong Kong wanted a rapid introduction of elective democracy. According to one knowledgeable source, the policy of convergence was a device. As Xu Jiatun, former Communist party chief in Hong Kong, notes in his own memoirs, in 1984 'the Chinese government resolved to adopt the 'convergence' strategy in a bid to contain the pace of political reform.' Sir Percy accepted this from the outset yet, like so many of accommodations Britain made with China at the time, it was only admitted afterwards and in this case not until 1988. This followed one of the more shameful acts of British colonial rule - a sham poll of local opinion to determine popular feeling towards democracy. Sir David Wilson, Sir Percy's leading acolyte and then governor, conducted the poll which, because of the complexity of the questionnaire, ended up sowing confusion rather than determining truth. A signature campaign conducted in parallel, which collected 250,000 names in favour of the early introduction of democracy, was rejected because it was not presented on the correct form. Little wonder that China got such a shock when Chris Patten arrived. Early in his career Sir Percy developed Cradock's First Law of Diplomacy. This held that it was not the other side you had to worry about, but your own. His memoir is an extended elaboration of this principle in ways he could not begin to understand.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Li Ning: "From State Treasury to Real </F> Bank"; first paragraph is BEIJING REVIEW introduction]    [Text] China will transform the People's Bank of China  into a real central bank and specialized banks into real  commercial banks. A number of policy-related banks will be set  up to engage in policy-related business.    Prior to 1978, the People's Bank of China was the only one  in  the nation. It was not only the bank for monetary issue, but  also the center for credit, settlement and cash receipt and  payment. Therefore, it was dubbed a monetary issue company or  state treasury.    At the end of 1978, China embarked on its reform and opening  policies. Deng Xiaoping, the chief architect of China's reform  and opening, instructed in 1979 that "banks should be real  banks," which raised the curtain on the country's financial  system reform.    Between 1979 and 1985, the Agricultural Bank of China and  the  Industrial and Commercial Bank of China were set up; the Bank of  China was separated from the People's Bank of China as a  specialized exchange bank engaging in international settlement  and foreign trade credit; the People's Construction Bank of  China became independent from the Ministry of Finance to handle  part of credit business. In 1984, the People's Bank of China  began to act as the central bank.    From 1986 to 1993, China established nine commercial banks,  including the Bank of Communications, the CITIC Industrial Bank,  the Merchant Bank, the Shenzhen Development Bank, the Fujian  Industrial Bank, the Guangdong Development Bank, the Everbright  Bank, the Huaxia Bank and the Shanghai Pudong Development Bank.  Their emergence put an end to the monopoly of state specialized  banks and promoted competition in China's banking industry.    However, economic operations over the last 10 years have  exposed undeniable shortcomings in the existing financial  system. The central bank does not behave like a central bank,  and neither do the commercial banks act accordingly. With its  macroregulation and control measures still characteristic with  those of a planned economy, the central bank fails to play its  due role in implementing the state monetary policy and in  managing and supervising national financial activities. It  handles its own policy related loans and runs investment and  trust companies. In the interim, the specialized banks handle  commercial as well as policy-related business. With fund  operations conducted in accordance with planned indicators and  administrative instructions, the specialized banks have no  autonomy to choose where to put money and therefore credit risk  does not exist.    The still not thoroughly reformed financial system certainly  failed to withstand the pounding of the socialist market economy  and the rapid development of the national economy after 1992.  In the first half of 1993 chaotic phenomena like fraudulence in  money raising and loan calling cropped up in the financial  market. This aggravated the excessive growth of investment in  capital construction and fixed assets, inflation and steep price  increases.    The Chinese government shifted the focus of reform and  opening onto finance.    On July 2, 1993, Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji was appointed  president of the People's Bank of China, a post concurrent with  his existing one. As soon as he took office, Zhu called a  working conference on national finance. Zhu put forward the 14  measures for macroregulation and control, trying to reverse the  chaotic situation in finance through rectifying the financial  order and strictly enforcing financial discipline so the  national economy could revert to the road of continuous, rapid  and healthy development. The efforts have created favorable  conditions for smooth formulation and implementation of  supporting financial reform measures in 1994.    At the press conference of the National People's Congress  and  the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference on March  17, Zhou Zhengqing, vice president of the People's Bank of  China, introduced the main points of financial reform in 1994.  Major points of his introduction are as follows:    Establishing a central bank macroregulation and control  system under the leadership of the State Council that will  independently implement the monetary policies;    Establishing a financial organizations network in which  policy related finance is separated from commercial finance, and  under which state-owned commercial banks are the main body,  while various financial institutions coexist;    Establishing a market system featuring openness, orderly  competition and strict management;    Turning the People's Bank of China into an actual central  bank and specialized banks into the real commercial banks;    Further opening up finance to the outside world, and  unifying  the exchange rate so the Renminbi can gradually become a  convertible currency.  <H5>  Macroregulation and Central Bank Control </H5>   Since it became the central bank in 1984, the People's Bank  of China has carried out independent monetary policies. It has  employed international practices such as reserve deposits,  rediscounts, interest rates, central bank loans and credit  limits to control the money supply and adjust the credit  structure.    Major function of the central bank Vice-President  Zhou Zhengqing pointed out at the branch head conference of the  People's Bank of China held in December last year that a real  central bank should lead and manage national financial  undertakings, scientifically devise and carry out monetary  policies and maintain essential currency stability; and exert  strict supervision and administration over financial organs and  ensure secure and effective operation of the financial system.  "Only the head office of the People's Bank of China has the  right to create monetary policies," Zhou emphasized.    Specific Reform Measures Zhou said major reform  measures include the following:    -- Transforming and defining functions of the People's Bank  of China. The head office of the People's Bank of China has the  rights to issue money, manage basic monetary policies, regulate  and control total credit, and regiment bench mark interest  rates, in order to guarantee the face of monetary policies  throughout the country. Usually, the head office of the People's  Bank of China only allows provision of temporary credit to head  offices of national commercial banks. The basic duties of the  bank's branches include: financial supervision and management  investigation and statistical analysis, adjustment of horizontal  money supply, state treasury operation, cash allocation,  exchange management and interbank settlement    -- Reforming and improving monetary policies. The ultimate  goal of the monetary policy of the People's Bank of China is to  maintain currency stability and thus promote economic growth.  In line with the macroeconomic situation, it will flexibly use  monetary policy tools such as legal deposit reserve rates,  central bank loans, rediscounts, interest rates, open-market  operations, central bank foreign exchange operations and credit  lines to regulate and control the money supply. It has started  from this year to handle separately funds and business of  commercial and policy-related banks, cut off the direct  connection between the central bank's basic money supply and  policy-related loans, and to practice asset liability ratio and  asset risk in managing the Renminbi and foreign currency credit  in commercial banks.    -- Fortifying the supervision and management of the central  bank over the national banking industry. Drafts of the Law of  the People's Bank of China, the Bank Law of the People's  Republic of China, the Law of Negotiable Instruments and the Law  of Insurance will be submitted to the National People's Congress  for examination and approval in 1994. In the interim, rules and  regulations managing various financial institutions will be  drawn up and refined. According to Zhu Xiaohua, vice president  of the People's Bank of China, China will soon make up and  enforce 22 laws, regulations and methods relating to the banking  industry. The drafting has absorbed some common articles from  foreign bank laws and related regulations under the market  economy. Starting from the reality of China, these statutes  will be made similar to international practice so the Chinese  financial market can be linked with global financial circles.  <H5>  Financial lnstitutions </H5>   Within the financial institutions network, policy-related  finance should be separated from commercial finance. With the  state-owned commercial banks as the main body, the network  should accommodate financial institutions of various kinds.    Policy-related banks: Beginning from the second  half of 1993, three policy-related banks were founded and  formally put into operation in 1994. They are the State  Development Bank that accommodates funds for key state  construction projects; the Agricultural Development Bank that  provides policy-related loans for the country's reserves of  grain, cotton and edible oil, contracted purchase of farm and  sideline products, and agricultural development; and the Bank of  Import and Export Credit.    Policy-related banks are geared to the needs of state  policies and do not aim at making profits. They provide special  loans that are beneficial to overall stability, such as specific  loans for infrastructure construction, stocks of key materials,  and poverty aid and disaster relief. Their interest rates are  much lower than those of the market.    Policy-related banks do not participate in commercial  banking  competition but receive the supervision of the central bank.    Conventionally, policy-related banks do not absorb social  deposits. Therefore, they have no direct debt relationship with  the public. The main sources of funds come from financial  allocation, central bank reloans, bonds issued to the public,  regular sums left in social security funds, and indirect use of  post office deposits.    In establishing the policy-related banks, China has drawn on  foreign experience as a reference, especially that of the United  States and Japan. Still in their preliminary stages, China's  policy-related banks are not as detailed in function as their  foreign counterparts.    State-owned commercial banks: As policy-related  banks take over policy-related financial business, the existing  state-owned specialized banks (including the Industrial and  Commercial Bank of China, the Agricultural Bank of China, the  Bank of China and the People's Construction Bank of China) will  be transformed into state-owned commercial banks. They will  operate with the mechanisms of modern commercial banks, featured  by autonomous management and assumption of full responsibility  for profits and losses.    State-owned commercial banks, though rivals, can undertake  interlocked business. All their operations must strictly abide  by the Bank Law of the People's Republic of China and other  financial rules and regulations. They must receive the  supervision of the central bank.    Other financial institutions: In addition to the  People's Bank of China and the above-mentioned four state-owned  specialized banks, China's financial institutions include nine  commercial banks such as the Bank of Communications, 12  insurance companies, 387 financial trust and investment firms,  87 securities bodies, 29 financial houses, 11 financial and  leasing concerns, 59,000 rural credit cooperatives and 3,900  urban credit cooperatives. All these constitute the Chinese  financial network.    All commercial banks and other non-bank financial  institutions will operate in line with the Bank Law of the  People's Republic of China and other related financial rules and  regulations.    In this financial reform, rural and urban credit  cooperatives  will change into rural and urban cooperative banks, whose major  task is to develop the local economy and provide services to  small and medium-sized enterprises and agriculture, animal  husbandry and the fishing industry.  <H5>  Financial Market System </H5>   Diversification of credit forms and financial tools have  boosted the development of China's financial market. In 1986,  fund markets were established in the five cities of Shenyang,  Wuhan, Guangzhou, Chongqing and Changzhou. Over the following  several years, various kinds of financial markets were  established across the country. They included inter-bank, short  and long-term funds, corporate bond, national debt, note  discount, foreign exchange swap and stock markets. This  resulted in floating interest rates and commodity capital.    In 1993, China successfully set up its first-class national  debt dealer system. This symbolized the move by China's  national debt market toward standardization and international  practice. From this year on, the Ministry of Finance stops  borrowing from the People's Bank to amend the financial budget,  and therefore, the financial deficit shall be met through the  issue of national debt. During his visit to Japan in early  March, President Zhu Rongji said that China, in order to control  inflation, will adopt tight currency and strict financial  policies to control money issuing and expenditure. Specifically  speaking, China will issue national debt to replace its previous  practice of meeting deficit by borrowing money from banks and by  money issue. This is a significant reform. This year, the  proportion of national debt in the financial budget in China is  about the same as that in Japan.    Another major measure in this year's financial reform is the  unification of the exchange rate. The unitary floating exchange  rate based on the exchange market price was put into effect from  January 1. Coinciding with global practice, this move will have  far-reaching significance on Sino-foreign economic exchange. It  will help attract foreign investment and pave the way for China  to restore its status in GATT. In addition, it opens a path for  the free convertibility of the Renminbi, the ultimate goal of  the reform of the exchange management system.    Experts say that only when China has sufficient exchange  reserves, Chinese commodities occupy a significant share in the  world market, Chinese enterprises are internationally  competitive enough, and Chinese legal conditions improve, can  the Renminbi's free convertibility finally materialize.</p>

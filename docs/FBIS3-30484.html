			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] According to Karel Kovanda, Czech ambassador to the  United Nations, who chaired the UN Security Council in January,  peacekeeping by the United Nations is a question for the distant  future.    Karel Kovanda sees his success and that of Czech foreign  policy in the Security Council mainly in the fact that the other  countries view the Czech Republic different from the way they  did a month ago. Kovanda said that he purposely managed to cut  down the length of the council's meetings but increased their  efficiency.    He said it is a hard fact of the present world that the  council has only limited powers that could be further curtailed  by the decreasing interest of the individual states in  supporting the council by, for example, being reluctant to offer  their soldiers for service.</p>

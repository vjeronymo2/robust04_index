			<p>BFN     [Text] Ankara--Turkey's financial crisis, which has led to  the collapse of three banks and nine stock brokerage houses this  year, has now spread to the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus  (TRNC).    Turkey's Sekerbank, in compliance with a court decision, has  confiscated part of the assets of Akdeniz Garanti Bankasi, based  in Nicosia and owned by the Semiler family. Akdeniz Garanti  Bankasi owed $1 million to Sekerbank, half of which was said to  have been repaid immediately after the confiscation.    Akdeniz Garanti is controlled by Bulent Semiler, former  general manager of the now bankrupt state-run Anadolu Bankasi  and a close economic aide of the late President Turgut Ozal.  Semiler is a major shareholder of Impexbank, which was the  third and last bank to collapse on April 24. Impexbank,  controlled by the Semiler and Eliyesil families, was owned by  fugitive Turkish Cypriot businessman Asil Nadir.    Bankers say that most Turkish Cypriot banks are closely  linked with Turkish banks and that the most recent crisis in  Turkey has had serious repercussions on the island. "The  relationship between the Turkish banks and the Turkish Cypriot  banks are [as published] very complex. In the coming days, this  complexity will become more apparent," said one banker in an  interview with the Anatolia news agency.    Anatolia reported that Akdeniz Garanti had issued a  statement  saying that some circles in the TRNC had deliberately spread  ominous rumors regarding this bank, in order to tarnish its  image.    "Those circles aim to take control of the bank," ran the  statement.    After the government's April 5 austerity package, the  Turkish  Treasury banned three private banks from carrying out any  banking activities. Following the collapse of TYT [Foreign  Trade] Bank, Marbank and Impexbank, eight stockbrokers and the  leading brokerage house AOG Turkinvest have gone bankrupt. There  were reports over the weekend that a number of creditors (unpaid  investors) attacked the Istanbul headquarters of Turkinvest and  smashed its windows.    Turkinvest was banned last Friday [29 April] from trading  activities, just a day after it offered a debt swap to its  creditors, who claim 1.3 trillion Turkish lira ($38 million)  from this firm. The Capital Markets Board (SPK) said in a  statement that it had halted the activities of the leading  brokerage house, Turkinvest; which now faces the threat of  liquidation.    Turkinvest was accused of becoming involved in fictitious  repo (repurchase) transactions worth TL 100 trillion.    Its chairman, Nasrullah Ayan, said he would not "give up so  easily."</p>

			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / India unveils lending rate cut of 1 point THE Reserve Bank of India, the central bank, yesterday signalled a modest easing of monetary policy with a 1 percentage point cut in commercial lending rates and a relaxation of liquidity rules for banks. Mr S Venkitaraman, the governor, said the measures were a response to distinct signs of recovery in the Indian economy, after a sharp slowdown in growth last year when the government introduced austerity measures to cope with a balance of payments crisis. But industrialists said the cut in commercial banks' minimum lending rate from 19 per cent to 18 per cent would not be enough to revive the economy. The Confederation of Engineering Industry had asked for a 4 point cut. Stock investors were unaffected by the central bank's announcement and the Bombay Stock Exchange's 30-share index fell eight points to 3211.55. Nevertheless, a leading government economist said the cuts would be 'a modest stimulus' to industry. Yesterday's rate cuts were the first since rates were raised to record levels last year and follow a sharp decline in the annual inflation rate from a peak 16.3 per cent to 8.8 per cent at the end of last month. However, the reserve bank is adjusting its policy cautiously. While the commercial banks' minimum lending rate is being reduced, and deposit rates are also coming down, the central bank's bank rate, its main indicator rate, will stay unchanged at 12 per cent. The reserve bank also cut its statutory liquidity ratio - the proportion of funds which commercial banks are obliged to invest in government securities. This spring the ratio was cut to 30 per cent for new deposits from 38.5 per cent. Following yesterday's announcement, the figure for existing deposits will be reduced from 38.5 per cent to 37.75 per cent, in a move which will release funds for commercial loans. In a speech to bankers in Bombay, Mr Venkitaraman said industrial production would probably rise by 4 to 5 per cent in the 1992-1993 financial year, which started in April. This follows a marginal 0.1 per cent increase last year. Meanwhile, in a cautious move to restore life to the market in government securities, which has been hit by a Rs35bn scandal, the central bank is resuming the sales of government securities to banks under repurchase terms (repos). Repo sales were stopped in May when the scandal erupted. However, a ban on repo sales between banks, which were the occasion of regulatory abuses, will stay in place.</p>

			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar consolidates its gains DESPITE another turbulent week in the foreign exchange markets, dealers are wondering whether currency tensions have significantly eased following the subtle changes in German monetary policy, writes James Blitz. Yesterday, sterling, the dollar and the Italian lira all continued to gain against the German currency as dealers digested the recent cuts in the Bundesbank's money market dealing rates. The Bundesbank again injected liquidity into the German money markets at a rate of 8.9 per cent, 60 basis points below the emergency Lombard rate, which provides the ceiling for official rates. Technically, the Bundesbank could reduce the Lombard rate by  1/2 a percentage point without affecting the structure of market rates. Germany's high monetary growth makes this a difficult option. Nevertheless, three other factors have weakened the D-Mark this week. German industry faces growing problems, highlighted by yesterday's news that German exports fell 19 per cent in August. The Bundesbank drained more liquidity from the market in September than had been thought. A London based analyst said yesterday that the Bank had drained DM75bn of liquidity compared to intervention of about DM92bn last month, controlling growth in the M3 money supply. The US Federal Reserve looks as though it will not cut interest rates until after the US Presidential election because it regards the signs of economic slowdown as inconclusive. The differential between US and German short term rates looks unlikely to widen in the next two months. The dollar yesterday closed in London at DM1.4855, up 8 pfennigs on the week. Sterling closed at DM2.5125 this week, up nearly 15 pfennigs from Monday's lows, despite a troubled Conservative party conference. Pressure has not come off the weaker currencies in the Exchange Rate Mechanism. Mr Jim O'Neill, head of research at Swiss Banking Corporation in London, says the lira's devaluation puts pressure on the peseta and escudo because their economies are closely linked. 'Relative competitiveness and a devalued lira put pressure on the other two,' he said. The peseta closed at Pta71.51, near to its floor of Pta72.62. The French franc is in a category of its own. The franc's overnight rate was at 12 per cent last night, with the currency closing at FFr3.388 to the D-Mark, against an ERM floor of FFr3.4305. Ms Joanne Perez of Banque Indosuez in Paris says the central bank's reserves are at a mere FFr20bn, making high interest rates the only effective weapon.</p>

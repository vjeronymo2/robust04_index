The  meeting was held following the conclusion of an OAS visit that  lasted several days to the areas in conflict.    Leo Valle Lanza, president of the international commission,  indicated they had received reports from the CPR settlers on  harassment by Army soldiers, mined camps, and restrictions  placed on their movements. "It is obvious that as a result of  the proximity of the combat areas, there could be guerrilla  movements, but this does not necessarily imply the CPR are  cooperating with the subversives," Valle Lanza added.    "The only thing they want is to be recognized as a civilian  population and for their most basic rights to be respected,"  noted the international official who also indicated President de  Leon Carpio had confirmed his intentions to respect those  rights. This is why the OAS delegates consider the  demobilization of the military detachments near the CPR a top  priority. Nevertheless, they received Defense Minister Mario  Rene Enriquez' assurance that no military operation are being  carried out in those areas.    The international commission was made up of Valle Lanza,  David Padilla, Elizabeth Houppert, and Osvaldo N. Kreiner. The  commission was accompanied by Fernando Alvarez Guadamuz who  indicated they had visited Xalbal, Cantabal, Cuarto Pueblo, San  Francisco Los Angeles, San Luis, and La Esperanza; they also  spoke to the soldiers of the nearby detachments.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From "The News" newscast] </F>   [Text] President Rafael Caldera has emphasized that  constitutional amendments must include provisions for an  impeachment referendum, that is, the possibility that people  could impeach any government official, including the president,  who fails to perform his duties. He made these statements at the  opening of a play called "Venezuela, Political Crisis, and  Constitutional Reforms." He also said that participative  democracy must be the main aspect of the amendments to ensure  that people will have a say in the nation's important  sociopolitical issues. He also rejected all doubts that the  community will not be able to understand the amendments due to  the large number of articles.    [Begin Caldera recording] People will not discuss the  amendments article by article; they will merely reply yes or no,  as is done in every democratic country. They will ratify or  reject the amendments drafted by the National Congress. [end  recording]    He also said that it is necessary to give the Venezuelan  people a greater opportunity to participate and more power in  view of the situation the country is currently experiencing.</p>

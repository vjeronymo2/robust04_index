			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / Property: Help yourself to a sale - Few houses sell themselves; most need preparation by the vendor before the buyers arrive. Gerald Cadogan tells how to go about it THERE ARE people who continue to believe their houses will sell themselves. It is, of course, not that simple. But some close attention to the state of the property can make for an easier - and more profitable - sale. Good houses, priced realistically, often sell quickly although they are still unlikely to match their value of early 1989 or mirror the booming 1993 stock market. But preparation - particularly of houses that may take time to move - remains a key point. Put another way, the vendor's job is to present the house so attractively that the potential buyer cannot overlook its charms and might even fall for them. What does that mean if you are selling? Your family must be ready to help in showing people around, turning off the ghetto-blaster, or not wandering naked at the wrong time between bathroom and bedroom. Remind them that, in most cases, the intention is that all should benefit from the sale/move. The sour atmosphere of a family squabble does not help a sale. Do not hasten to tell your neighbours: so says Andrew Smith, of national agent Strutt &amp; Parker. Word will spread quickly, probably giving the wrong price. The house will soon become stale news, damaging the short, intense sales campaign a good agent is likely to recommend. Surprise helps selling. Buyers like to think of themselves as early birds catching the new day's worm. Read the draft of your agent's brochure carefully. Is it a fair, open-minded description? If you like, you can add a personal note on what the place means to you. That will help some buyers and should not run foul of the Property Misdescriptions Act. Check carefully the fittings mentioned in the text. Are they the ones you intend to be included in the sale, or will you remove some? Should any be available as extras? Buyers are not happy if they think they are getting a house with an Aga but, on completion, find the Aga gone. It could lead to a lawsuit against you. The effective time to talk about the house, and how you and your family have lived in it, is when taking buyers around and you can gauge the sort of people they are. Remember - they are buying the house, not you. But mentioning changes you would have made had you the time or money could prove an irresistible challenge for them to carry out. Arrange for the photographs in the brochure to be taken as close as possible to its printing and the house coming on the market - and, says Smith, 'on a bright, sunny day.' Buyers look for what they have seen in the brochure and do not like to think it has changed. Repaint before the photographs and do not change the furniture afterwards. Then, it is clear you are not hiding anything. If the garden has its best flowers in the spring but you are selling in the autumn, include a picture if you have one. Here, the brochure is more use than viewing. Have the house tidy, clean and welcoming as if you are awaiting guests. A few flowers help. But do not overdo the tidying-up or you will reveal your anxieties. It is more important that the house looks confident and lived-in. If it is too neat, especially in children's rooms, the buyer will think it is sterile and go away wondering how anyone could live in such over-disciplined unreality. Mow the grass and tidy the garden, at least enough to show that you maintain it as an integral part of your life there. If there is a tennis court, remove any weeds. A swimming pool must be clean. Live in the house during the sale period if possible, and keep as much furniture as you can. The more homely it is, the better. Minimise buyers' fears of a large bill for repairs and re-decoration. A small outlay by you on necessary repainting, clearing gutters, checking downpipes and fixing loose slates and tiles is almost a sure bet to be repaid several times over. Be chary, though, of a complete redecoration; it might put buyers off. You do not know what colours they like or what furniture they have. (London is different, particularly in the rich, central area where overseas buyers often are glad of a completely decorated flat or house into which they can move at once). Be pleasant and natural to the buyers. Answer their questions honestly but do not gush. If you have transformed the house from a humble past, do not be surprised if some are disappointed; they may think it has become too comfortable for its origins. Fitted carpets did not exist when most old rectories and farmhouses were built. Too many now could deter those buyers who prefer polished wood floors with rugs; they will be happy not to acquire the floor coverings mentioned as an extra in the brochure. But all buyers are glad of a watertight house. If the buyers have come a long way, offer them tea or coffee. And do not let bawling children and yapping dogs put them off even before they have started to look. If you take them through the rooms, let them go round by themselves afterwards. It gives the privacy they must have to decide if your house is the one they want. Finally, if the property is listed, have photo-copies of the listing entry, and of any mentions in Pevsner's Buildings of England or articles about it in Country Life, ready for the buyer to take away to read later.</p>

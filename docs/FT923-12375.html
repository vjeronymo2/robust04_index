			<p>920718 FT  18 JUL 92 / Damages agreed for dioxin claim THE SETTLEMENT yesterday of the first claim for damages brought by a worker exposed to the toxic chemical dioxin might provoke further actions, solicitors said. Mr George Yates, 43, who worked for Rentokil from 1978 to 1988, received Pounds 90,000 in agreed damages. He claims to have suffered from cancer as a result of exposure to dioxin and other chemicals during the course of his work. The claim, against Rentokil Group, the environmental services and property care concern, was settled out of court after action in the High Court. Mr Alan Care, from solicitors Leigh, Day and Company, acting for Mr Yates, said lawyers in other countries had been waiting for the result of this first case involving dioxin and pesticides. It would 'open the doors to other related claims' worldwide. Dioxin, the toxic byproduct of many manufacturing processes, is the subject of controversy, with disagreement on the extent of its alleged link with cancer. The settlement contained no admission of liability, but Rentokil is angry with its insurers, a syndicate at Lloyd's of London, for agreeing the deal. 'We strongly object to the settlement and deplore the fact that it may raise unjustified fears among our staff,' said Rentokil. It added that, on the evidence, Mr Yates's claim was unjustified and there was no connection between his exposure to chemicals and the rare condition he was suffering from - soft-tissue sarcoma. The decision to settle had been made 'purely on commercial grounds when the insurers decided it was uneconomical to defend the action'. It would have cost at least a further Pounds 200,000 to pursue the case and because Mr Yates was receiving legal aid there would have been no hope of recovering costs even if Rentokil had won, the company added. However, Mr Brian Smith, the syndicate underwriter, defended the decision. 'We have doubts about whether they could win the case,' he said. 'We don't want to create case law because the next time you've got a case like that you have no chance of negotiating.' Mr Yates claimed he sprayed large quantities of pesticides during the course of his work. He alleged that his cancer was caused by dioxin impurities in the chemical pesticide Pentacholorophenol, or by the chemical itself.</p>

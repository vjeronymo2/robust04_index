			<p><P> November 5, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE HUMAN RIGHTS ORDINANCE IN IRVINE  </P> <P> I was reading the ballot arguments for and against Measure N in the Voter  Information Pamphlet distributed by the Orange County registrar for Tuesday's  ballot. I find a clear distinction in the way the arguments are presented.  </P> <P> The city attorney's impartial summary says that "this initiative would delete  any references to sexual orientation (in the city's Human Rights Ordinance)."  </P> <P> The argument for Measure N says the issue is special protections for  homosexuals, not discrimination, and proceeds to give examples of how that's  true and reasons why the Human Rights Ordinance needs to be amended.  </P> <P> The argument against the measure signed by the City Council defending its  ordinance tells me that the "people of Irvine" enacted this "nationally  acclaimed Human Rights Ordinance." I don't know about you, but I didn't vote  for it.  </P> <P> The mayor tells me that a "handful . . . of extremists seek to destroy this  ordinance." Yet the press reports that 7,000 Irvine signatures qualified N for  the ballot. Since when did 10% of the voters become a "handful of extremists?"  Only 8,500 voters showed up at the last school board election.  </P> <P> Why does the City Council insist on name-calling rather than dealing with the  issue as the city attorney outlined it? I would encourage everyone to read the  arguments for and against and then let the mayor know how you feel on Tuesday.  </P> <P> LINDA HIGGINBOTTOM  </P> <P> Irvine  </P></p>

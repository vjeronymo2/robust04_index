			<p><P> October 29, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GOLF COURSE PLAN IN HUNTINGTON BEACH  </P> <P> At a recent Huntington Beach Town Hall meeting, Lynn Shackelford of American  Golf Corp. assured concerned citizens that there would be no problem getting  water for the "wall-to-wall irrigation" of their proposed golf course in  Central Park. According to Shackelford, if future shortages develop, the water  will be taken from allocations for agriculture and there will be no water  problem.  </P> <P> The Huntington Beach City Council would be well advised to examine this  situation in light of the recent water rationing announced by San Clemente  officials. Each of San Clemente's two municipal courses uses 600,000 gallons of  "reclaimed" water per day.  </P> <P> While our neighbors to the south are planning to conserve water, we're planning  to use our municipal drinking water for "wall-to-wall irrigation" of a golf  course! This water will be provided to American Golf at a reduced rate, a cost  that will be subsidized by residential users of water in the city.  </P> <P> DARRYL C. BOOM  </P> <P> Huntington Beach  </P></p>

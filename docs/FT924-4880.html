			<p>921130 FT  30 NOV 92 / Economics Notebook: Russia changes direction of its radical reform The government of Russia is changing its economic course. It has proposed a fundamental change in direction, in which the emphasis on fiscal and monetary measures, given pride of place earlier this year, yields precedence to an underscoring of its effort to support industry, to stop the fall in living standards and to construct a 'social' market economy. This is an important shift. Whether or not it will be given a chance to work is a matter of politics, and the politics will be played out in public from tomorrow in the febrile forum of the Congress of Peoples Deputies - at the centre of whose deliberations will be the government and its performance. Mr Yegor Gaidar, the acting prime minister, has striven to make clear in the past week that there is no desertion of radical reform. The direction is the market, an open economy and a stable currency - all conceived of as the indispensable economic infrastructure for a civil and democratic society. Yet while this new course is not a turning back, it is more than just a 'correction'. The key text for the shift is a document of some thirty pages, called 'A programme of urgent measures to lead the Russian economy out of crisis'. It was completed eight days ago, and was drawn up by a commission of experts, one side of which was drawn from the government and headed by Mr Sergei Vassiliev, director of the Centre for Economic Reform; the other side of which was drawn from the Civic Union and the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, headed by Mr Yevgeny Yasin, director of the latter organisation's expert institute. This is the written basis of the agreement between the government and the Civic Union - though it is clear that no broader political agreement is yet firm. The document makes a spirited and too-rare claim for some success, pointing out that the conditions for market relations have at least been laid, that the queues have largely disappeared and that the trust of foreign countries has been retained. But it does not minimise the failures. Inflation is up to around 25 per cent a month. The rise in prices continues. The production fall shows signs of evening out, but has gone on longer and to lower levels than forecast. Many enterprises are on the verge of bankruptcy:the rouble has fallen to close to 500 to the dollar; foreign trade regulations change constantly. In the long list of mistakes with which the programme begins, one theme is dominant: that is, that the government is not able to execute its will and has been absent from too many processes in which it should have been a main actor. It has not secured laws on bankruptcy and private ownership of land; it has not been able to stop illegal exports, and the illegal transferring abroad of vast amounts of hard currency. It has been helpless before a surge in crime and in the continued inertia and interference of the bureaucracy. It is now deemed a mistake to have avoided what is now seen as a responsibility: that is, to support Russian industry; to give clear guidelines to the state companies; to take an active hand in the reconstruction of those which have good prospects; to subsidise and promote exports, and to define and support enterprises which could substitute for imports. This theme is writ large in the main body of the programme. Central to it is this observation: 'An objective account of our realities and analysis of the vast experience, both positive and negative, which we have acquired in the past year shows that in our real conditions we cannot just have a transition to a regulated market so much as a regulated transition to the market.' In short, the government no longer expects individuals, enterprises and institutions to make their way to capitalism by unsupervised actions within a legal, monetary and fiscal framework. The Russian - or rather, post-Soviet  -realities have been shown not to permit it. A market needs to be created: the creator can only be the state. To quote the programme again: 'this means a strengthening of state power, and the raising of its efficiency'. This is a great deal to ask of a state as fractured and demoralised as the Russian one now is: furthermore, of one which has lost so much of its once grossly overcentralised power to other levels of regional and local bureaucracy, and to the enterprises. As the programme bitterly notes at one point, the enterprises usually keep the profits, passing on their debts to the state. It is important to note that the programme does not abandon fiscal and monetary rectitude: on the contrary, it devotes several pages to a description of how it will be achieved. But it also says this: 'to restore production and the living standards of the population, it is not possible to stop inflation quickly.' (It later says that the aim is now to get inflation down to between 8 per cent and 10 per cent a month within six months.) Further, it promises a lot of support - to the population's living standards, of course; to various sectors; to scientific institutions; to exporters. Only in one sentence does it promise the 'regulated reduction of enterprises and branches which have no future'. Clearly, to do all this and fight inflation is almost certainly too tall an order. It is, in the end, only a programme. The interest is not in the detail but in the direction: the government is now prepared, in order to gain the support of the centrist block represented by Civic Union, to try its hand at constructing a viable corporatism, on the grounds that only through that will it be able to establish reform on a broad enough social base to make at least some of its objectives attainable. It is not at all clear if this will go far enough. Like most such programmes, there is something in it for everyone: and without trust between the contracting parties, the fears of the Civic Union that the current government would be much keener on the monetary and fiscal instruments than on the apparatus of industrial planning could be well grounded. The next days and weeks will see how far this new course is a political tactic, or a real economic strategy.</p>

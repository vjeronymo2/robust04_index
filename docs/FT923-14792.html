			<p>920706 FT  06 JUL 92 / UK Gilts: Weak economy pulls in the buyers MORE evidence of economic weakness in the UK pushed up demand for gilts, led by many large institutions anxious to build up their bond portfolios at the expense of equities. Speculation about a possible cut in base rates over the next few weeks helped to force down yields for most classes of gilts. The general demand for gilts - following the underlying pattern in the gilt market for much of this year - caused a rise of nearly 2 points at the long end of the market. Yields slipped by about 20 basis points. Evidence of the fragility of the UK economy came with news that the savings ratio - personal savings as a percentage of disposable income - hit 11.5 per cent in the first quarter. This was up by 1.5 points on the fourth quarter of last year, to the highest level for nearly a decade. With the Treasury almost daily receiving more reports of economic weakness, many commentators are reducing their forecasts for growth this year in the UK to around zero, after a drop in gross domestic product last year of 2.4 per cent. While such gloomy scenarios lead to poor prospects for equities, the low inflationary pressures likely over the next year make gilts a tempting investment for many institutions. That was underlined by Bank of England figures last week indicating that such bodies bought Pounds 5.9bn worth of gilts in April and May. Further signs, meanwhile, of weak upward pressure on prices throughout the economy are likely on Friday when the Central Statistical Office is expected to announce that the retail prices index increased by just 4.1 per cent in the year to June, after 4.3 per cent in May. After the cut in US interest rates last week by the Federal Reserve, with a view to stimulating the lacklustre US economy, technical operations on the money market by the Bank of England fuelled expectations of an early cut in UK base rates, now 10 per cent. But while such a move would go down well with the US - which at this week's Munich economic summit of the seven richest nations is expected to push for concerted measures to boost world growth - the pound's weakness in the exchange rate mechanism probably rules out a base rate cut for the time being. All the signs are that Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, will continue for some time with his policy of not risking a possible slide in sterling by a rate cut. That seems at a point when UK short-term rates are only 25 basis points above the equivalent German rates. While the gilt market would be quite happy to see a cut in rates of perhaps a quarter of a percentage point - a move which would boost prices at the short end - it is equally at home with the prospect of Mr Lamont's policy of high interest rates squeezing out the last drop of inflationary pressure from the economy for some months to come. The Bank announced it will make available from today Pounds 700m of new gilt issues; Pounds 200m of 10 per cent conversion stock due 1996; Pounds 200m of 9 1/2 Treasury loan stock maturing 1999; Pounds 200m of 9 per cent Treasury loan due 2008; and Pounds 100m of 2 1/2 per cent index-linked Treasury stock, expiring in 2013.</p>

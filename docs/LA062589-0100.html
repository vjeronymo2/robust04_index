			<p><P> June 25, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BOARD VOTE ON THE AIDS ORDINANCE  </P> <P> Is anyone paying attention out there? You people who continue to support County  Supervisors Gaddi H. Vasquez, Don R. Roth and Roger R. Stanton. You people who  continue to re-elect Rep. William E. Dannemeyer who stands before groups, opens  his mouth and spews out falsehoods which only further ignite the hysteria, hate  and ignorance of the uneducated and short-sighted opposition to an anti-AIDS  discrimination ordinance.  </P> <P> Thanks to these officials, Orange County can now hold its head in shame as  being the only urban county in California to ban this ordinance. How long are  you going to keep your heads in the sand and pretend this is a "gay disease"  which we can ignore?  </P> <P> Ignorance and fear cannot be tolerated in the fight against AIDS. Don't wait  until you are personally affected by AIDS-related death of a friend or  co-worker. Let Vasquez, Roth, Stanton and particularly Dannemeyer know they  made a major error and that you won't continue to support such backward  thinking.  </P> <P> KATHY JAMES  </P> <P> Laguna Beach  </P></p>

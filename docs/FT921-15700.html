			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar remains under pressure THE DOLLAR remained under pressure on the foreign exchange markets yesterday, stabilising against the D-Mark but falling back against the Japanese yen before finding late support in London. The focus on the yen/dollar exchange rate came as US President George Bush and Mr Nicholas Brady, US treasury secretary, arrived in Tokyo for talks with Japanese ministers. Dealers commented that the two sides may agree a controlled devaluation of the dollar against the yen as a means of moderating the US trade deficit with Japan. Some analysts expect the authorities to target a rate of around Y120. Against this background, the dollar slipped in Far Eastern trading, ending in Tokyo at Y123 from a Y124.05 close in London on Monday. During the Tokyo day the US currency fell below Y123 for the first time in three years. In European trading the weak tone continued, with the dollar declining to Y122.75. But a late bout of profit-taking pushed the Japanese currency down and the dollar finished at Y124.35 in London, before dipping to Y123.90 in New York. The yen/D-Mark exchange rate also attracted significant trading volume, with the German unit firming from Y81.68 to Y81.83 during the day. The US currency was less volatile against the D-Mark, following a substantial fall on Monday. In Tokyo the dollar closed at DM1.5160, from a DM1.5190 close in London on Monday. In Europe the dollar tested technical support at DM1.5120 before rallying to end at DM1.5195 in London. In New York it fell to DM1.5065. However, analysts are expecting the dollar to weaken further against the D-Mark and other European currencies later this week if economic statistics show the US economy to be weakening. If weak non-farm employment figures are released on Friday and poor producer price inflation figures tomorrow, this could prompt a further easing of US monetary conditions and a flight of international funds out of US financial assets. Elsewhere, sterling slipped further against the D-Mark but remained above its 'floor' within the European exchange rate mechanism. From a close of DM2.85 on Monday, sterling eased overnight in Tokyo to open at around DM2.8475 in London and then further softened to end at DM2.8450. Analysts noted that sterling fell in line with its permitted lower limit against the D-Mark within the ERM. The floor moved from around DM2.8470 on Monday to DM2.8405 yesterday due to a weakening of the Spanish peseta, the strongest currency in the ERM. As the permitted floor moved lower, currency traders could push the pound down without the risk of being caught by concerted central bank intervention. Sterling also suffered from press reports that Mrs Margaret Thatcher, the former prime minister, is in favour of a devaluation of the UK currency within the ERM.</p>

Kim's trip, his first state visit to the two countries since  taking office in February 1993, was originally designed to  strengthen South Korea's economic ties with its nearest  neighbors.    Kim told reporters Tuesday he hopes his visit will serve as  a  turning point in resolving the nuclear crisis on the Korean  peninsula.    He said besides in-depth discussion of the North Korean  problem, bilateral economic cooperation and closer trade ties  will top his agenda in talks with Japanese and Chinese leaders.    Kim is scheduled to hold talks with Japanese Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa on Thursday and Friday, and with Chinese  President Jiang Zemin next Monday. He will return to Seoul on  Wednesday.    Kim is being accompanied by his wife Son Myong-sun and three  cabinet ministers.    In a departure ceremony at Seoul airport, Kim said he will  try to obtain support from Japan and China to resolve the  nuclear issue and also bring North Korea around to reform and  openness.    "I will explain to the two leaders of Japan and China that  preserving reconciliation and peace on the Korean peninsula is  important to ensuring stability and prosperity in the  Asia-Pacific region as well as in Northeast Asia," Kim said.    He said North Korea has created confrontation on the Korean  peninsula by failing to allow unhindered inspections of its  nuclear facilities and make progress in inter-Korean dialogue.    "While keeping the channel of dialogue open, South Korea,  with firm security commitment of the United States, is also  fully determined to fight against any possible provocation by  North Korea," he said.</p>

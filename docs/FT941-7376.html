			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / World Trade News: Philips in cable TV venture Dutch electronics group Philips is joining forces with United International Holdings of the US to invest in cable television infrastructure in about a dozen European countries. The joint venture will focus at first on the physical infrastructure through which cable television is transmitted, but may expand later into programming. Philips sees cable television as an important outlet for its ambitions in multi-media electronics. It already owns stakes in cable television networks in its home town of Eindhoven as well as in Vienna, Paris, Brussels and other European cities. UIHI has interests in the cable infrastructure of countries from Norway to Hungary. The two companies' existing investments in cable television already cover a potential 2.5m European households, of which 1.5m are subscribers. They plan to expand the potential number to 7.5m.</p>

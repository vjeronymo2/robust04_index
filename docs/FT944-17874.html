			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / Legal challenge to Tube strike The RMT transport union faces a legal challenge to stop the 24-hour Tube strike which is due to start at 7.30 this evening. London Underground is questioning the validity of the union's ballot which resulted in support for industrial action. It said last night: 'We are considering seeking a High Court injunction to prevent the disruption. There were irregularities in the ballot.' The RMT is demanding a basic pay rise of at least 4 per cent although the rest of the staff employed by London Underground have agreed to a pay settlement this year of 2.5 per cent. A total of 15 hours of talks at the conciliation service Acas earlier this week failed to produce a deal. London Underground said it was willing to hold further discussions but emphasised it would not improve its 2.5 per cent offer. The company says that a number of its employees who are RMT members failed to receive voting papers for the ballot, although they were entitled to participate. The union denied this yesterday, pointing out that London Underground had given no indication of how many employees were covered by the complaint. It said that its solicitors were considering the position. Only 37 per cent of the 7,500 RMT members at London Underground took part in the ballot last month. Of those, 2,072 backed strike action and 809 opposed it. The ballot was carried out by an independent organisation - Electoral Reform Balloting Services. A 24-hour strike planned for last Friday was called off when it became clear that notification of the strike had not specified the exact period of the action. The union's lawyers advised the executive to make the period covered by the stoppage more precise. Mr Bob Crow, a leading leftwing member of the RMT executive, has been elected one of the union's three assistant general secretaries. He ousted Mr Tony McGregor by 2-1 in a ballot of members.</p>

Sethuram: "Will India Gain From GATT?"] </F>   [Text] At last, a new world trading system is emerging from  the tortuous negotiations spread over seven years which could  have been short-circuited had a deal on farm subsidies been  struck by USA and the European Community at the ministerial  meeting in December 1990.    That collapse was followed by the comprehensive Draft Final  Act (DFA) popularly known as "Dunkel Draft" to which India had  been the bitterest opponent among developing countries.    The positive conclusion of the Uruguay Round on December 15  is undoubtedly a major milestone for the global which now enters  an era of greater and fierce competition for markets by both  developed and developing countries.    Most of the world barring former Soviet Union and China,  which are yet to be formally admitted to GATT will be bound by  the new rules and disciplines governing international trade.    Who will gain more and who will lose out in the bargain will  depend more on each country's outward-orientation, its  productive efficiency, and competitive strength. To the extent  that India measures up to these standards, it should stand to  benefit, if not in the short-run, at least over the longer term.    India had from the beginning taken a clearcut stand that its  hopes are bound up with only a multilateral trading system with  transparent rules and non-discriminatory treatment.    This does not mean that protectionist barriers raised over  the last decade by the major industrialised nations are going to  be instantly lowered. Nor would the global accord in any way  diminish the ardour of nations seeking regional fortresses. For  India, which is not in any of the trading blocs, the single  market of Europe or NAFTA, which comes into existence on January  1, 1994, multilateralism provides the best insurance against  marginalisation, especially given its already low share of world  exports at around 0.60 per cent.    Developing countries could have got a better deal in the  Uruguay Round had there been effective coordination among  themselves through the long period of negotiations. The  South-South cooperation was not brought into sharp focus while  it has been ritualistically emphasised at meetings of G-15 or  other forums of developing countries.    India's main concerns with the Dunkel Draft were in respect  of intellectual property protection, textiles, agriculture and  services. It become difficult to get any revision of the Dunkel  text in regard to Trade-Related Intellectual Property Right  (TRIPS) when all developed nations as well as a large number of  development countries themselves had gone with the kind of  intellectual property protection regime provided for. Of course,  there is a ten-year transition period before India would have to  fall in line with the new regime.    In textiles, developing countries seem by and large  satisfied  with the phasing out of the multifibre agreement though the  maximum liberalisation would materialise only in the latter half  of the ten-year period from January 1, 1995.    India has been assured by its major trading partners and  GATT  Director General Peter Sutherland that the Dunkel Draft would  not affect present level of subsidies to agriculture or the food  security system through public distribution or use of seeds by  farmers. In services, it is not clear whether India's interests  (labour migration) have been embodied in the final document.    Overall from India's point of view the outcome of the  Uruguay  Round should be regarded more positive than negative. Until  India becomes internationally competitive, there is the risk of  its market being more open and being flooded with cheaper  imports. The only safeguard against this would be an effective  anti-dumping legislation. Also India is entitled to retain some  non-tariff barriers so long as its balance of payments situation  continues to remain difficult.    While the East Asian economies owe their dramatic success to  exports of manufactures--an area where India could do equally  well now that the economy has been liberated to a considerable  extent--India can also become a significant exporter of  agricultural commodities without domestic injury as the country  is capable of producing surpluses, especially in superior  varieties of rice and commercial crops.    The Uruguay Round had largely been played out as a big power  game and the developing countries, more than 45 of which had  started reforming their economies were watching helplessly. They  fell so frustrated that any deal would have been welcome for  them. It is in this situation that India could achieve little in  what started as the most ambitious and comprehensive trade  negotiations in 1986.    A strengthening GATT with safeguards mechanism and trade  dispute settlement machinery can be expected to monitor the  observance of the new rules and disciplines more effectively.</p>

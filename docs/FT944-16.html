			<p>941231 FT  31 DEC 94 / Outdoors: Youth appeal - Motoring / Why Rover transformed the Metro More of a nose job than a full facelift. That sums up the cosmetic changes Rover has made to the Metro for 1995. The name has changed, too. In future, it will be a Rover 100, which is what it has been called for several years on mainland Europe, where a metro is an underground railway. The changes should make Rover's smallest modern car more attractive to young buyers who have been put off by its angular, early-1980s styling. This was a pity. Since it was given a new engine, transmission and suspension a few years ago, the Metro has been one of the best superminis for ride, refinement and handling. But it lacked sales appeal because it looked thoroughly middle-aged. Safety and security improvements include a cheap (Pounds 245) driver's airbag option, standard side intrusion beams in the doors and a combined alarm and immobiliser. In addition to Rover's own K-series 1.1-litre and 1.4-litre petrol engines (right), the 100 may be had with a Peugeot-Citroen 1.5-litre diesel. Prices start at Pounds 6,495. Three two-pedal 100s with continuously variable transmission will be good town cars and would be even better if power steering were available. A cabriolet with power-operated hood that joins the Rover 100 family in the spring will cost about Pounds 12,000.</p>

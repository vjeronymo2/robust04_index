			<p>BFN     [Text] Australia's prime minister, Paul Keating, says the  closure of three news magazines by the Indonesian Government is  an internal matter for Indonesia. But Mr. Keating's office in  Canberra said Australia was a strong supporter of freedom of the  press which was regarded as a basic right. A spokesman said Mr.  Keating would go ahead with his planned trip to Jakarta despite  a call by a leading Indonesian human rights lawyer to cancel the  trip following the banning of the magazines by the government of  President Suharto. Michael Marr reports from Jakarta.    [Begin Marr recording] The head of Indonesia's Legal Aid  Institute, Adnan Buyung Nasution, has urged Mr. Keating to  cancel his trip to Jakarta which is scheduled for next week to  protest against the closure of the three news weeklies. The  leading human rights lawyer has also called on U.S. President  Bill Clinton to call off his planned visit to Indonesia due to  take place during the Asia-Pacific Economic Forum's leaders  summit later this year. The government has yet to fully reveal  why it banned TEMPO, the country's leading news magazine, and  the popular publications DETIK and EDITOR. However, all three  magazines have recently published articles critical of the  country's research and technology minister, Dr. Yusuf Habibie,  who is a confidant of President Suharto. Pro-democracy  activists have been quick to declare the closure of the  publications as a major setback to openness in Indonesia. So  far, authorities have yet to say whether or not the bans will be  permanent. [end recording]</p>

			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / BBC dispute returns to Acas Talks between the BBC and its main broadcasting unions will resume at Acas, the conciliation service, on Monday in a further attempt to resolve the dispute that has already led to two 24-hour strikes. The BBC offer to return to Acas to clarify its final package came after Bectu, the main technical union, and the National Union of Journalists decided to call off industrial action planned for tomorrow, the day of the European election results. Unions were also encouraged by the willingness of the BBC management to discuss the detail of the terms of employment - a key factor behind the dispute. As a result of the signs of flexibility further industrial action planned for Tuesday has also been dropped although the unions have given no commitment beyond then. The dispute is about the implementation of performance pay and some terms and conditions of employment which can in future be subject to negotiation in individual BBC directorates rather than centrally. Movement came yesterday after a letter to staff from Mr John Birt, the director-general, saying that the BBC needed a closer link between pay and individual performance. Mr Birt said: 'Annual increments - raising pay automatically because someone remains in the job - are antiquated and have no place in a modern workplace.' He warned, however, that if there were any further industrial action the BBC would invoke formal procedures which would almost certainly lead to suspension of striking staff. A continuing series of strikes could not come at a more potentially embarrassing moment for the BBC. The government is in the final stages of completing a white paper on the future of the corporation which is due to be published this month or next. It would be difficult for the BBC management to decide that a 'final offer' was not final after all. The return to Acas also helps union leaders who do not want to be seen to be responding to threats of suspension.</p>

			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Saatchi confirms seamless transition at the top - The appointee who will take control of the group's gradual recovery SAATCHI &amp; Saatchi yesterday confirmed at its annual meeting in London that Mr Charles Scott, currently chief operating officer, will assume the role of chief executive from June 1993, replacing Mr Robert Louis-Dreyfus, who will resign from all functions. At one level the move comes as something of a surprise, though it has been a poorly-kept secret for some time that Mr Louis-Dreyfus wished to move on. He was brought in in January 1990 to draw up and implement a rescue operation, a recapitalisation scheme which, 16 months later, was successfully in place. Although the group is no longer on the deathbed, it is still in convalescence. In March the group reported pre-tax losses of Pounds 58.4m, on a annualised basis, to the end of December 1991, against pre-tax profits of Pounds 35.6m for the year to September 1990. It is still facing earn-out payment burdens of Pounds 21m this year, rising to Pounds 28m in 1993, but falling to Pounds 13m and Pounds 10m in the following two years. Net debt in the final quarter of 1991 averaged Pounds 200m. But on another level, the appointment of Mr Scott will be as close as possible to a seamless transition. Mr Louis-Dreyfus brought Mr Scott into Saatchi to assist with the refinancing negotiations. Thus the move recognises Mr Scott's key role in bringing financial control back to an organisation which was rapidly sliding into shambles. The two will be working in tandem for the coming year, as they have since January 1990. Mr Scott says that it is difficult to outline financial targets over the short term due to the depressed state of world economies. 'The reality is that to sit here now and say how much revenues are going to increase in 1993 is not a sound basis for planning.' Improving group performance will not be easy this year, when advertising revenue projections of 2 per cent real growth are already being revised downwards. How will Mr Louis-Dreyfus and Mr Scott improve operating margins from the 'clearly unacceptable' 2.8 per cent 1991 level to their target of reaching 10 per cent in the next three years? Mr Scott sees the key in dealing with loss-making areas: 'Whatever happens to revenues, we will raise margins to 10 per cent by the elimination of loss-making concerns, either by turning them into profit or closing them down. I don't think we would necessarily sell companies in order to raise margins; though we would sell them if we don't see them as being a core business for the company.' Thus while the group's two international advertising networks, (Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Worldwide and BSB), the direct mail company (Kobs and Draft), its public relations company (Rowland), and its media-buying arm (Zenith) are seen by both men as central, a sprinkling of smaller US and UK companies are going to come under close scrutiny. 'We don't anticipate that there will be any loss-making operations by 1993,' says Mr Scott. One plan likely to come to fruition before the end of 1993 is to expand Zenith's media-buying operation through a European link. Mr Scott can hardly be further removed from the common image of an advertising person; he epitomises caution and exudes thoughtfulness. Thus he was keen to emphasise the gradualist approach he has to steering Saatchi back onto the straight and narrow. For 1992, he is content to hope for small but real improvements: 'It will be a year not dissimilar to last year, with things showing constant improvements. We have been working all the time on rationalising the company and that will continue. My particular role is to improve the earnings as much as possible.'</p>

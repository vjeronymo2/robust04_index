			<p><P> January 24, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: MEDICAL;  </P> <P> AFTER JAPANESE PURIFICATION CEREMONY, HITACHI BREAKS GROUND FOR UCI CENTER  </P> <P> Following a traditional Japanese ceremony to purify the land, ground was broken  Monday on the $12-million Hitachi Chemical Research Center to be built on the  UC Irvine campus.  </P> <P> The 40,000-square-foot building, scheduled to be completed in the spring of  1990, will be used jointly by Hitachi Chemical Co. Ltd., a diverse Tokyo-based  chemical manufacturer, and the university, under an agreement approved in March  by the University of California Board of Regents.  </P> <P> Appearing at the 2-hour ceremony were Hitachi Chemical President Dr. Ryoji  Yokoyama, UCI Chancellor Jack W. Peltason, UCI College of Medicine Dean Ted  Quilligan and Kenneth Gibson, director of the California Department of  Commerce.  </P> <P> A Shinto ceremony to purify the building site was conducted by three priests  from the Meiji Shrine in Tokyo. By Japanese tradition, a cone of dirt was moved  with a plow and a hoe. In recognition of the U.S. ground-breaking tradition, a  shovel was also used in the ceremony.  </P> <P> The university is providing rent-free land to Hitachi for the center. In  return, UC Irvine will use the ground floor of the building for research and  office space.  </P> <P> Hitachi will occupy the top two floors of the building for the 40-year term of  the lease, after which the entire building will become UC property.  </P></p>

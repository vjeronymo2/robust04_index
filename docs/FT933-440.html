			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / The Labour Party Conference: Hackles raised over one-member-one-vote DEFENDERS of Labour's union links failed yesterday to persuade the party conference to support an emergency resolution blocking the leadership's plans for reform. But traditionalists promise a further battle today when the national executive committee's proposals to 'modernise' the link are presented by Mr John Smith, the party leader. Attention has focused on plans to democratise the selection of parliamentary candidates by limiting the franchise to individual party members - ending the unions' right to cast up to 40 per cent of the vote. This proposal, referred to as one-member-one-vote, is opposed by many unions. Their alternative would give an individual vote to union members who pay the political levy which helps to finance Labour, most of whom are not party members. Union leaders refer to this as every-member-one-vote. Voting on the proposals will be complex. Delegates will be asked first to approve a statement by the national executive committee setting out Mr Smith's proposals. Then there will be votes on eight resolutions followed by votes on five rule changes to give effect to the NEC proposals. For the leadership, the key will be the rule change votes. If approved, they will take precedence over any successful resolutions. The NEC statement makes three main proposals: Parliamentary candidates would be selected by individual members voting in their constituencies, instead of jointly by individuals and affiliated union branches. Union members would have a vote, but only if they paid the political levy and a further fee of Pounds 3 to join the party. Union branches would retain the right to nominate candidates and to take part in running constituency parties. The leader and deputy leader would be elected by an electoral college giving a third of the votes to each of three groups: unions, members of the Westminster and European parliaments, and individual members. Unions have 40 per cent of the votes in the existing college, with the balance split between parliamentarians and constituency parties. The block vote would be weakened by forcing unions to split their votes between individual delegates. However, unions would still be able to control delegates by mandating them in advance. The unions' 70 per cent share of conference votes would be reduced to 50 per cent, but only if party membership increases from 260,000 to 300,000, reversing a long-term decline. The rule changes required to give effect to these proposals will be determined in a series of five 'card' votes, in which union leaders will vote - under the existing rules - on behalf of all members who pay the political levy. The resolutions will matter only if one or more rule changes fail to pass. Two are straightforward: composite 55, moved by the rightwing Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union, broadly supports the NEC, and resolution 375, moved by Leicester East constituency party, supports the retention of block voting. Opposition to the leadership will centre on composite 58, moved by the TGWU, and composite 57, from the GMB general workers' union. The GMB motion seeks to preserve one third of selection votes for union levy payers, who would vote through their unions without being required to join the party as individuals. The TGWU motion seeks to reserve 40 per cent of selection votes for levy payers voting through their union, and to preserve the block vote. The motion also instructs the NEC not to use its reserve powers to introduce a revised system. This is intended to block the leadership's fallback plan to impose one-member-one-vote if the rule changes are defeated. If that happens, the leadership's best hope is composite 56, which says that levy-paying union members should participate in selections as individuals 'on a fairly agreed basis.' The leadership says this phrase could be interpreted as authorisation for the NEC proposals.</p>

			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / Equity Markets: Other Markets - Interest Rates The outlook for higher interest rates in the US and Germany will dominate activity this week. James Capel reckons that the strength of the real economy data over the last month points to a rise in rates at Tuesday's US Federal Open Market Committee and it reiterates, ahead of Thursday's Bundesbank meeting, that the underlying strength of German M3 over recent months has indicated an inflationary risk from 1996 'and we therefore still think German rates have bottomed'. Kleinwort Benson rates the chances of a US rates rise after the FOMC as very high and it expects the strength of the economy will force the Fed to raise rates to 5 1/2 per cent by the end of this year, and 6 1/2 per cent by the middle of 1995. UBS, however, is sceptical about the need for a rise in US rates, saying that the markets are exaggerating the extent of the US inflation threat, not least because the tightening of policy seen so far this year has already put in place influences that will limit the cyclical rise in prices in 1995. It also expects the Bundesbank to leave official rates unchanged, saying that policy is on hold until after the Federal election. Thereafter, further disinflation may yet facilitate one final round of monetary easing. Compiled by Michael Morgan</p>

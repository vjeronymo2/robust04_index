			<p><P> July 22, 1989, Saturday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> FERNANDO GETS DODGERS A SPLIT WITH PIRATES  </P> <P> Fernando Valenzuela overcame early wildness that included four walks in one  inning to pitch the Dodgers to a 7-3 victory and a split of their doubleheader  with the Pittsburgh Pirates Friday night.  </P> <P> John Smiley pitched a five-hitter and hit a tainted three-run double in the  seventh inning as the Pirates won the opener, 4-1, to extend the Dodgers'  losing streak to four games.  </P> <P> Valenzuela (5-9) walked four batters in the second but did not allow a run  because Barry Bonds was caught stealing. Valenzuela checked the Pirates on four  hits over seven innings, walked six and struck out two in winning for the first  time since June 24.  </P> <P> Jay Howell worked the last two innings for his 18th save in 20 opportunities.  </P> <P> Mike Marshall hit his first home run since April 16 in the second, starting a  string of five one-run innings against Neal Heaton (1-7), who remained winless  since May 21. Heaton allowed seven hits and five runs in 5 2/3 innings in his  first start since June 5.  </P> <P> Eddie Murray singled home a run in the third, then doubled and scored on Jeff  Hamilton's double in the fifth. Alfredo Griffin singled with two out in the  fourth and eventually scored on shortstop Rey Quinones' fielding error as the  Dodgers won for the fifth time in 12 games.  </P> <P> In the first game, Smiley (8-5) ended a three-game losing streak by striking  out four and walking two to win for the first time since beating St. Louis,  5-3, on June 25.  </P></p>

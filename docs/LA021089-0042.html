			<p><P> February 10, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SMALL BUSINESS / JANE APPLEGATE: FORGET INDUSTRIAL PARKS -- HOTTEST NESTS FOR  START-UPS NOW ARE IN 'INCUBATORS'  </P> <P> In the past, when it was time to move a fledgling business from the back  bedroom or garage, the choices were mainly limited to an affordable but bare  industrial park or perhaps a dreary office building in a marginal neighborhood.  </P> <P> Once settled, a feeling of loneliness or isolation often sets in. Adjacent  businesses were established and not experiencing the same growing pains.  </P> <P> But now, savvy real estate developers, knowing that California has 1.4 million  small businesses, are courting their owners in new ways.  </P> <P> "Most small businesses are relegated to the wooden office buildings on the  fringe of town," said Fred Ellsworth, chief executive of American Comm Centers,  a real estate development firm. "Our buildings are marble and glass."  </P> <P> Some developers, like American Comm Center, have built high-tech office centers  divided into small suites. Others have turned abandoned factories into small  business complexes that are now being called "incubators." And, still another  company built a small business venture park on the site of a defunct drive-in  theater.  </P> <P> The key difference between most small business complexes and a true incubator  is the amount of low-cost management services offered to tenants, according to  the National Business Incubation Assn.  </P> <P> "Anybody can use the term incubator," said Dinah Adkins, executive director of  the Athens, Ohio group. "It's a sexy term and right now many people are  glomming on to it."  </P> <P> To qualify for membership in the association, a business incubator must not  only provide basic services such as telephone answering and a mail drop, but  offer management and technical services to tenants. The services most  frequently requested by tenants are business and financial planning,  accounting, loan packaging, advertising, legal services, tax preparation and  advice on international trade.  </P> <P> So far, there are about 330 member-incubators in the U.S. and Adkins projects  that the number will jump to 1,000 by 1991. She said many incubators are  operated by nonprofit agencies, while others are private, profit-making  ventures.  </P> <P> Incubators are especially popular in the East, where a decline in heavy  manufacturing created a glut of large factories and warehouses, ideal for  renovation. Pennsylvania alone has 38 incubators, Adkins said.  </P> <P> In California, small business incubators are appearing all over the state,  according to Oscar Wright, California's small business advocate. "Eighty  percent of new small businesses fail within the first five years," said Wright.  "But for companies located in incubators, there is an 80% success rate."  </P> <P> Wright, who serves as a liaison between business owners, the governor and the  state Legislature, said he has found thriving incubators in Santa Ana, San  Diego, Redding, San Francisco, Chico, San Jose and San Pedro.  </P> <P> The San Pedro Venture Center on Gaffey Street is home to 18 businesses, ranging  from a tile company to a hazardous waste disposal firm. The center was  originally a drive-in theater. Faced with a lack of business, Pacific Theatres  initially built a mini-storage building on the 13-acre site. When the  mini-storage tenants begged to install telephones and desks in their storage  rooms, the company decided to build the venture park, according to Frans  Vershoor, project director.  </P> <P> The center, which opened in September, will ultimately include 11 buildings  with space for retail stores to warehouses. The park also features a day-care  center scheduled to be operated by a local YWCA.  </P> <P> Services include a fax machine, photocopying and secretarial services, a  conference room, mail room and a staffed reception area. In the works are plans  to offer marketing, accounting, tax, legal and business planning services,  Vershoor said.  </P> <P> A more traditional business incubator opened four years ago in Chico, Calif.  The former Chico-San noodle factory became available when H. J. Heinz bought  the company and moved its operations. Heinz sold the building to a nonprofit  organization for $150,000 and the Business Center was born. Four manufacturing  companies and four nonprofit organizations are located there. Operating an  incubator is "more than just being a friendly landlord," said Audrey Taylor,  executive director. "We need to be there when they feel that entrepreneurial  terror."  </P> <P> Small business owners seeking luxury and service are moving into two new  centers operated by American Comm Centers. The Comm Centers, one in Richmond in  the Bay Area, and the other in Ontario, Calif., cater to small, professional  business owners such as realtors and insurance agents.  </P> <P> The Comm Center staff not only answers phones and greets visitors, but provides  tenants with services such as 5,000 words of dictation and 500 free photocopies  a month. The rent also covers utilities, janitorial service and parking.  </P> <P> "I feel so good, I can hardly wait to get to work in the morning," said Terrie  Marzetta, a realtor who recently moved into the Hilltop Comm Center in  Richmond. "It's warm, the coffee is made and someone has been answering my  phone." Ellsworth said the next Comm Center is scheduled to be built at the  Fluor Corp. complex in Irvine.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Growing in Long Beach  </P> <P> The third annual Long Beach Minority and Women Business Development Conference  is set for 7:30 a.m. to 1 p.m. Feb. 24 at the Ramada Renaissance Hotel, 111 E.  Ocean Blvd. The city's Community Development Department sponsors the gathering,  which features exhibits and speakers on subjects including marketing and  home-based business. For information call 213-590-6487.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Yellow Pages Lessons  </P> <P> Last year, American businesses spent $8 billion on Yellow Pages advertising.  For many small businesses, it was their only form of advertising. Yet many  business owners are unsure about how to get the most out of the Yellow Pages.  To help them, Barry Maher, a former marketing representative for GTE  Directories, has written a practical guide to Yellow Pages advertising.  </P> <P> "Getting the Most From Your Yellow Pages Advertising" is published by Amacom  Books, a division of the American Management Assn. in New York. The book  provides insights and advice for small business owners. It costs $14.95 and is  available through Amacom, 135 W. 50th St., New York, N.Y. 10020.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Looking at 1992  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Venture Assn. is presenting Robert W. Nichols, president of RNC  Capital Management Co., at its Feb. 14 breakfast meeting. Nichols, a registered  investment adviser, will speak on "1992 -- A New World Trading Order Impacts  the 1989 Economic Outlook."  </P> <P> The meeting begins at 7:15 a.m. at the Bel Air Summit Hotel, 11461 Sunset Blvd.  The cost is $35, including breakfast. For reservations and membership  information, contact Christine Buteyn, executive director, L.A. Venture Assn.,  213-450-9544.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with PLO Executive Committee member Jamal </F> al-Surani by Rashid Khashanah in Tunis; date not given]    [Excerpts] [Khashanah] How do you interpret the delay in  appointing members of the Palestinian authority, despite the  Executive Committee's extensive meetings?    [Al-Surani] Forming the Palestinian authority or the  government is not an easy issue that can be ended in hours or  days. There are numerous normal contacts, because we are moving  from one phase to another...from the revolution, which has  numerous concerns but limited requirements, to the phase of  taking responsibility for a people's life, including health,  education, housing, transportation, post, food, electricity, and  other needs. [passage omitted]    [Khashanah] When will consultations be completed as regards  forming the authority, and when will it be officially announced?    [Al-Surani] We must first complete the consultations between  those inside and those outside and also among those outside. It  is a difficult equation. The objective is to ensure that the  ship is heading -- right from the start -- toward the shore of  safety.    [Khashanah] Have you agreed at least on the foundations and  criteria?    [Al-Surani] That too is among the issues we are currently  discussing. I expect the consultations to be completed within a  week or 10 days at the latest. [passage omitted]    [Khashanah] In practice, how will the Executive Committee be  the authority for the National Authority?    [Al-Surani] That decision was taken by the Central Council  in its October session, because the Executive Committee  represents the Palestinian people's unity. If the national  authority inside is for those inside only, it would be as if we  are saying that the Palestinian people in the diaspora have  nothing to do with Palestine. The Executive Committee's being  the authority qualifies it to continue to be the political and  spiritual bond for the Palestinians inside, about 3 million of  them, and the Palestinians outside, about 3 million of them. It  means that the problem of the diaspora Palestinians will  continue to exist and will not be solved except with the  deferred issues -- Jerusalem, dismantling of the settlements,  and self-determination.    [Khashanah] Does that mean that the Palestinian state will  continue to be based in Tunis?    [Al-Surani] Foreign activity will remain in Tunis. Because  under the accord signed in Washington, the Palestinian authority  is not entitled to have foreign relations. But the PLO has  secured the recognition of 127 states, and we shall safeguard  these relations and exploit them in the interests of our people  inside and outside. Because it is unreasonable for Israel to be  in charge of our relations with the world, especially as we have  secured this international recognition through the sacrifices  made by our people. [passage omitted]    [Khashanah] It is said that there are criticisms against  granting Fatah sensitive posts....    [Al-Surani] First, no one disputes that Fatah is the mother  organization. Second, those who get posts now are not the  winners, because the early posts are very demanding. Anyhow,  such talk did not take place at the Executive Committee's  meetings. On the contrary, it asked everyone to participate,  the Popular Front, Hamas, the Democratic Front....    [Khashanah] What will the Executive Committee's fate be  after the formation of the authority and its entry into Jericho?    [Al-Surani] It will continue to exist and operate until the  National Council elects a new Executive Committee at its next  session.</p>

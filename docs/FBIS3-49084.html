He adds that no power plant  except the Chaira Pumped Storage Power Station has been under  construction since 1990 and that in three to four years time the  Maritsa Iztok 1 Thermoelectric Power Station and some other  minor thermal power plants will be closed down. According to  Mr. Shervashidze, a nuclear as well as some conventional types  of generating facilities should be built in Bulgaria. At the  same time, he believes that the current 40 percent proportion of  nuclear power in electricity production is the optimum and  should be maintained. According to Mr. Shervashidze, it would  be more profitable to build an N-plant but this would take at  least six years and the only feasible site is in Belene (where a  new nuclear power plant went under construction back in the  1980's and was put into cold storage in 1990 for lack of money  and under environmentalists' pressure).    The chairman of the Power Engineering Committee denies press  allegations of the existence of a "nuclear Mafia" in Bulgaria  but says he himself belongs to a nuclear power lobby campaigning  to convince the government and people in this country of the  excellent prospects and the economic efficiency of nuclear  energy in Bulgaria.    Further in his interview, Mr. Shervashidze says there are  several projects for completion the second nuclear power plant  in Belene (on the Danube). According to him, the site in Belene  can accommodate six nuclear reactors of 1,000 megawatts each.  The draft project envisaged two nuclear reactors of 1,000  megawatts each, but later it became clear that 500-100 [as  received] megawatt units suited better Bulgaria's energy supply  system and their construction was feasible.    Nikita Shervashidze believes the motion by 14 MP's for a  moratorium on the development of nuclear power engineering and  the construction of nuclear facilities can not be serious. "A  plant for recycling cool radioactive waste is being built and if  such a moratorium is imposed, the construction will have to be  stopped," Mr. Shervashidze says.    He points out that the construction of gas-powered stations,  worth about $1,100-1,200 per kilowatt of installed capacity, is  also possible in Bulgaria, but the high prices of imported gas  raise the cost of such projects.</p>

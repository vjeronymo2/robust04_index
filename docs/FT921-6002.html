			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / How to Spend It: Sitting pretty REPRODUCTION used to be a dirty word but, these days, needs must. As the supply of the genuine articles dies out, those who like their furniture old, tried and trusted have had to turn to those manufacturers who turn out perfect copies of the pieces they love. Priors Hall started life selling antiques but gradually found itself restoring pieces and then making, for example, a chair to complete a set. Today, it is engaged full-time in producing fine copies of period furniture. But it is not in the business of merely copying - it actually builds its pieces entirely by hand, following the line and spirit of the originals and using the same materials, the same detailing and the same finishes that make the original so desirable. As it copies only the finest and the best, the comparisons in price with genuine antiques are staggering; for instance, Priors Hall can sell you a fine copy of a Queen Anne Burr walnut kneehole desk for about Pounds 4,000. If you could find the real thing, you would probably have to pay around Pounds 38,000. Priors Hall Chippendale dining chairs sell for Pounds 380 while the going rate for an original is 10 times more. The Regency sofa, photographed here sells for Pounds 1,250 while an original would probably fetch Pounds 2,500. Anybody interested can visit the recently-opened shop at 604 Fulham Road, London SW6 5RP (Tel: 071-384-2223).</p>

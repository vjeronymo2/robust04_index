			<p><P> May 24, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COKE GIVING TIPS ON TABS THAT DON'T WORK  </P> <P> As Coca-Cola Co. learned once before when it came up with a bright idea for  marketing, things don't always work exactly as planned.  </P> <P> It recently put prizes -- including cash -- in some Coca-Cola Classic cans as a  $100-million summer promotion for the brand, a name the company made up in 1985  after a brief and disastrous marketing brainstorm to substitute the  longstanding Coke formula for something new. However, in some instances, the  prizes have failed to pop up as designed when customers pull the tab and some  thirsty people have found themselves gulping down a mouth full of chlorinated  water.  </P> <P> Thus, the Atlanta-based soft-drink giant found itself Wednesday explaining in  full-page newspaper ads how the darn things are supposed to work. "As you may  already know, any can of Coca-Cola Classic could be a MagiCan. Although  MagiCans don't have Coca-Cola Classic in them, you can't tell them apart from  the real cans. So we'd like to help you recognize a MagicCan when you find  one," read the ad that appeared in 50 papers, including The Times.  </P> <P> If it is a "MagiCan," the company said, the prize should pop up immediately  when the customer pulls the tab. In a "small number of instances," the prize  mechanism may jam, the ad said. "But by simply tapping the prize 'stem,' it  should pop up," the ad said. If "something is jiggling inside the can, the  prize mechanism has become detached," the ad said, although that is not  supposed to happen. When it doubt, look in the can, the ad said. "If you see  anything other than Coca-Cola Classic, it's a winner."  </P> <P> Most of the cans contain a rolled up $1 bill, but they also have coupons for  prizes, including one for a trip to the 1991 Super Bowl. Some have bills in  denominations as high as $500, said Coke spokesman Randy Donaldson. The  "MagiCans" contain chlorinated water so that they will be indistinguishable  from cans filled with Coke. The water is not supposed to come out even if  someone tries to drink it, but there have been leaks and other failures, the  company said.  </P> <P> The ad advised people not to try to drink from "MagiCans" -- although the water  is harmless -- and included a toll-free number to report problems.  </P> <P> "To put this in context, we've had a very small number of complaints. At the  same time, people around the country have won about 60,000 prizes," Donaldson  said. The Coca-Cola U.S.A. promotion, which ends Aug. 15, is "unique," he said.  "It's never been done before," said a jovial Donaldson in apparent delight that  a deluge of media attention would boost further the promotion.  </P></p>

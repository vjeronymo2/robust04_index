			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Alternative 5 lowers the organic HAP vapor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pressure level for tanks required to be vented to a control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> device. The control requirements for the other emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> points remain the same as for Regulatory Alterative 4.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Tanks in which the organic HAP vapor pressure of the waste  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or recoverable material in the tank is equal to or greater  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than 0.7 kPa (approximately 0.1 psi) use a cover and are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vented to a control device that reduces organic HAP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions by 95 percent. Tanks in which the organic HAP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vapor pressure of the waste or recoverable material in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tank is less than 0.7 kPa use a cover without additional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> controls.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Regulatory Alternatives for New Sources  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Based on current waste management trends, the EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expects very few, if any, new off-site waste and recovery  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operations facilities to be built in the foreseeable future.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A more likely scenario is construction of new units (such as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tanks or treatment units) at existing off-site waste and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recovery operations facilities to expand facility capacity,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> replace existing surface impoundments, or add new treatment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> capability or expand treatment capacity. However, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available information to the EPA is insufficient to make  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> projections of the numbers or types of new sources to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> built during the next 5 years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A regulatory alternative representing the MACT floor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for new sources at off-site waste and recovery operations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities was defined by combining the MACT floor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determinations for new sources. No regulatory alternatives  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> beyond the MACT floor were identified for new sources.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulatory alternative for new sources requires  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application of air emission controls on tanks, containers,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and treatment processes managing waste or recoverable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> material with a VOHAP concentration equal to or greater than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 100 ppmw as determined at the point where the material first  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enters the facility. For tank emission points, tanks in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which the organic HAP vapor pressure of the waste or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recoverable material in the tank is equal to or greater than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 0.7 kPa are required to use a cover and be vented to a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control device that reduces organic HAP emissions by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 95 percent (or equivalent floating roof technology). Tanks  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in which the organic HAP vapor pressure of the waste or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recoverable material in the tank is less than 0.7 kPa use a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cover without additional controls (i.e., a cover only  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> without being vented to a control device). For container  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission points, the regulatory alternative requires use of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a cover on each unit and use of submerged fill when wastes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or recoverable materials are transferred into containers by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pumping. For process vent emission points, the regulatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternative requires connecting the process vent to a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control device that reduces organic HAP emissions by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 95 percent. For land disposal unit emission points, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulatory alternative requires treatment of the wastes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prior to disposal to reduce the waste VOHAP concentration to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> less than 100 ppmw. For equipment leak emission points, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulatory alternative requires a implementation of a LDAR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program and certain equipment modifications specified under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the existing for ancillary equipment handling waste or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recoverable material streams with a total organic HAP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concentration equal to or greater than 10 percent. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment leak requirements are consistent with the existing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NSPS process equipment leak standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> G. Regulatory Alternative Impacts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The EPA developed estimates of the impacts associated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with each of the regulatory alternatives for existing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sources. As explained in the preceding section, no impacts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were estimated for the regulatory alternatives for new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sources because of difficulty in projecting the numbers and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> types of new sources likely to be built over the next  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5 years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Overview of Impacts Estimation Methodology  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In developing NESHAP and other air standards, the EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> frequently uses a model plant approach for comparing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternative control options. However, for the off-site  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> waste and recovery operations source category, it is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> difficult to adequately characterize the source category  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> using a selection of several representative model plants  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because, for many of the facilities in the source category,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the quantities and characteristics of wastes and recoverable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> materials received at the facility are highly variable and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> can change often (as frequently as on a day-to-day basis).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, many different waste management unit and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recoverable material reprocessing unit configurations are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used at off-site waste and recovery operations facilities to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manage these ever changing materials. Consequently, the EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decided a model plant approach is not appropriate for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> estimating control option impacts for the off-site waste and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recovery operations source category.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

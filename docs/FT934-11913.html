			<p>931029 FT  29 OCT 93 / Expatriate voting rights speeded up THE European Commission has rushed out legislation to enable the EC's 5m expatriates to vote or stand for election to the European parliament next June in the EC country where they live. The right to vote in local and European parliament elections in the country of residence is one of the principles of EC 'citizenship' contained in the Maastricht treaty, which comes into force on Monday. But to sidestep accusations that the new 'European Union' wants to harmonise long-established national rules on who can vote or stand for election, the Commission yesterday tabled complex legislation which respects existing regulations. For example, member states like Britain which impose a minimum residence requirement on their electorate, will retain that limit, but will have to take into account the time voters have spent living in other EC member states. Further rules will prevent candidates disqualified from standing in one member state from joining the party lists in another EC country, and information exchanges should help catch fraudsters voting or standing in two countries at once. The EC will try to ensure the measures are adopted by the end of the year. In most member states the proportion of expatriates is comparatively low - ranging from less than 1 per cent to 6 per cent. However, some 29 per cent of the Luxembourg population are foreigners - mainly Portuguese immigrants - and the Grand Duchy was worried that some of its constituencies would be dominated by foreign candidates. The draft directive gets round that problem by allowing Luxembourg to prevent all but long-term residents voting or standing for election.</p>

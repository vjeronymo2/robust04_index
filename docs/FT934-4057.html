			<p>931206 FT  06 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: BT's valuable connections As Oftel's decision on the rate competitors are to be charged for using BT's lines has drawn shouts of pain from all sides, it can probably be concluded that it is fair. Mercury complains that the large incremental payments it will have to make as it hits market share hurdles are a disincentive. BT, on the other hand, argues that since Mercury does not pay the full costs of using its network, its own shareholders are, in effect, subsidising Mercury. Even if that is so, there is a case for seeding the development of competition. If Mercury can use cheap access to undercut BT and increase its market share, that is acceptable up to a point. Oftel's hurdles of a competitor holding 10 per cent for some contribution to local network costs and 25 per cent to bear the full load seem reasonable. Underlying the whole issue, however, is the questionable notion that BT would charge more for its lines and less for its calls were it free to do so. In cities, competition from cable operators will hold down rentals. In remote areas, BT's licence, which does not allow it to differentiate between regions, will peg rental charges. In some senses, maintaining these expensive customers is a social obligation, and a clear identification of the real subsidy is desirable. That, however, might well result in a lower figure than BT currently claims, as part of the problem arises from the company's historically expensive local infrastructure. Such costs properly belong to its shareholders. The reduced rate of return which Oftel has allowed BT for handling third party traffic adds to the impression of a squeeze. With all this and the RPI -7.5 price cap, the pressure is on at BT.</p>

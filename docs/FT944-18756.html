			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / Arts: Anarchy versus German romanticism The South Bank has a multi-art 'Deutsche Romantik' festival in train now, ambitious but so broadly focused as to risk losing the bird-in-hand. It began on Thursday with a London Philharmonic concert: Beethoven's Fifth and Wagner's Wesendonk Lieder, very proper choices, but also Hans Werner Henze's Heliogabalus Imperator (from 1972, revised in 1986). The best excuse for that was that it prompted an introductory speech by Henze himself, who compressed an intelligent, soulfully Left-biased diagnosis of German romanticism into some ten minutes. GR (or DR, if you prefer) was a matter of reclaiming German folksong and its artless native ways; of revelling in the German Landschaft, in Weber's hunting-horns and simple, singable airs, and in Schubert's discovery of naive young millers and their maids. What came later, Henze told us, was tragically adulterated by ideology and nationalist propaganda. Wagner's name was never actually mentioned, nor the fact that subsequent musical developments came from Austrian composers rather than German ones. By implication, Henze's own Heliogabalus must have been meant as a celebration of the 'true' Romantic tradition - sexual liberation and happy anarchy, as it turns out, with no political intent whatsoever. One might mistrust that. Henze's gloire et misere have always been indissoluble from his extreme sensitivity to popular (student) political phases. Anarchical liberalism was fine for Woodstock, but it soured with Kent State, Altamont and the dull fate of Sid Vicious. Heliogabalus reaches back to an imagined hedonist past: the 15-year-old boy-Emperor makes his sumptuously exotic entrance, as reported by the ancient scribes, initiates three years of comprehensive polysexual debauchery (mostly on ravished, sighing strings) and is then brutally assassinated by the Praetorian Guard. That was not the kind of thing that Schubert or Weber had in mind. As a musical construction, Henze's Heliogabalus struck me this time as indefatigably colourful but thinly stretched. There are ritual post-echoes of his 1965 Auden opera The Bassarids - not of its androgynous hero Dionysus, but of the deadly ritual itself - at the start and finish. In between, with a spate of instrumental solos (for the young Emperor's newly appointed senators: 'children of love, rough-hewn but hearty') Heliogabalus tries on a variety of just-post-'60s dress: silky Messiaenic tone-clusters for the strings, birdcalls and learned two- or three-note effects from solo winds, some improvisation, some frank theatrics. It lacks any persuasive through-put. Fun, but not much cop. Franz Welser-Most conducted Henze with self-effacing flair. His Beethoven 5 was disconcertingly swift, without any of the time-honoured rhetorical pauses, but coolly alert and vital. For the five Wesendonk-Lieder, of which Wagner orchestrated only 'Traume', he recreated some plausible Wagnerianism. The soprano Amanda Roocroft found her expressive way into these songs rather well, without convincing me that they require anything less than the grand, steady depths that a fine mezzo can command.</p>

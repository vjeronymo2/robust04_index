			<p><P> December 4, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A BRAVE NEW ART WORLD?;  </P> <P> GALLERIES MOUNT ART/LA90, HOPING STABILITY HAS RETURNED TO THE MARKET  </P> <P> The New York art market hit the skids in November auctions, but you might not  know it by looking at the lineup of participants in ART/LA90, the fifth  international contemporary art fair at the Los Angeles Convention Center. About  165 galleries from 20 countries will offer thousands of artworks for sale at  the annual event, which begins Wednesday night with a benefit preview and is  open to the public on Thursday through Monday.  </P> <P> There has been some fallout this year, however. The Leo Castelli Gallery of New  York, the biggest name at last year's fair, will not be here. Castelli had  planned to participate but he changed his mind after suffering damage in  October when two vandals slashed paintings in his exhibition at FIAC, an art  fair in Paris. Other galleries have bowed out because of the ailing economy.  BlumHelman of New York and Santa Monica, Raab of Berlin and London, Ghislaine  Hussenot of Paris and Marc Richards of Santa Monica are among familiar faces  that will not be at ART/LA90.  </P> <P> "It seems like the year to take a pass on the fair, considering the economy,"  said Los Angeles dealer Neil Ovsey, who has been a regular since the fair's  inception but opted out this year.  </P> <P> But many dealers have returned and at least 30 others have plunged in for the  first time, including the Fred Hoffman Gallery and the Richard Kuhlenschmidt  Gallery of Santa Monica and the Union of Soviet Artists from Moscow.  </P> <P> "I think the economy is wonderful. Lots of people are buying art," said Dorothy  Goldeen of Santa Monica. She will be back "with my usual enthusiasm" for the  fifth year.  </P> <P> Outlooks for the fair vary sharply from dealer to dealer, but one thing is  certain: A staggering array of art will be for sale at the Convention Center.  There will be sculpture from Zimbabwe, paintings from Yugoslavia, sculpture  from France, prints from Canada, conceptual art from the United States. A  special feature, "The Belgian Show," will showcase four young Belgian galleries  including the Galerie des Beaux-Arts of Brussels which represents such major  European artists as Christian Boltanski and Wolfgang Laib.  </P> <P> Among hopeful vendors, the Linda Cathcart Gallery of Santa Monica will offer an  uncompromising roster of major pieces by such heavyweights as Robert Longo,  Cindy Sherman, Louise Bourgeois, Sigmar Polke and Pat Steir.  </P> <P> Fay Gold of Atlanta will show a bold assortment of primitive paintings by  "outsider" artists whose unschooled visions of human form often substitute  psychic shock for physical reality.  </P> <P> Having made a hit last year with Attila Richard Lukacs' shockingly realistic,  life-size paintings of skinheads and other intimidating tough guys, Diane  Farris of Vancouver will return with more works by Lukacs and other Canadians.  </P> <P> Visitors in the market for tried-and-true modernism can see works by Fernand  Leger at a booth run by the Evelyn Aimis Gallery of Toronto. Bright striped  paintings by Gene Davis will be available from Charles Cowles' New York  gallery.  </P> <P> Print collectors can check out Robert Indiana's "The Hartley Elegies," a  limited edition of five large (77x53-inch) silk screens that pay tribute to  Marsden Hartley's "German Officer" paintings, at a booth run by Park Granada  Editions of Tarzana.  </P> <P> Choices for photography buffs include Horace Bristol's 1944 shot of torpedo  planes, at G. Ray Hawkins' booth, and Bruce of Los Angeles' beefcake pictures  from the '50s in Jan Kesner's exhibition.  </P> <P> And for ceramics collectors, the Garth Clark Gallery -- on hand for the first  time -- will offer works by an impressive slate of artists who live in Southern  California or got their start here.  </P> <P> Will the fair be economically worthwhile for dealers who have paid between  $12,500 and $37,500 -- plus stiff transportation and staffing costs -- to show  their wares to a crowd that numbered 30,000 last year?  </P> <P> Only time, turnstiles and receipt books will tell, but fair organizers are  banking on a perception that "sanity has returned to the market" -- as a fair  press release announces -- and hoping that collectors are in the mood to  patronize dealers whose prices never approached the heights of spectacular  auctions.  </P> <P> Attempting to turn recessionary gloom into a beacon of light for art fairs,  ART/LA90 director Brian Angel said: "The movement is away from auction houses.  Large-scale art fairs, such as the one in Los Angeles, are proliferating  because their welcoming environment is light-years away from the elitism and  price-hyping at auctions."  </P> <P> The speculative factor that sent art prices into the stratosphere in the '80s  certainly seems to have vanished, but the general health of the art market is  subject to debate. Whispered reports of bargains in dealers' back rooms and  rumors of gallery closures are countered by denials of trouble.  </P> <P> No one disputes the fact that international art fairs have proliferated,  however. At least 25 fairs boasting top galleries have taken place this year --  so many that no dealer can make the rounds while minding the store at home. In  fact few galleries are represented in more than two or three fairs a year, and  the competition is fierce.  </P> <P> Los Angeles' fair suffers the disadvantage of distance for East Coast and  European dealers, and the five-year-old fair hasn't yet measured up to longer  established enterprises in Basel, Paris and Chicago, aficionados say. Every  year fair organizers seem to fight an uphill battle as they try to entice top  out-of-town galleries to participate.  </P> <P> Working to make the Los Angeles fair a distinctive, high-quality event, fair  organizer Charlie Scheips says he tries to persuade dealers to present  exhibitions that give an accurate picture of their galleries rather than to  bring re-sale items in hopes of turning a quick profit.  </P> <P> Another tactic to boost interest in the fair is to center it in a whirlwind of  activities and to tie it to a socially conscious theme. ART/LA90 will focus on  environmental protection. A $150-a-ticket dinner tonight at Morton's restaurant  and a $75-a-ticket fair preview Wednesday night will both benefit the Natural  Resources Defense Council, whose program combines legal action, scientific  research and citizen education. Heal the Bay, an organization formed to clean  up Santa Monica Bay, will benefit from a $30-a-ticket pre-fair brunch and art  exhibition, sponsored by Kurland/Summers Gallery at the Seventh Street Bistro  on Sunday.  </P> <P> The fair poster -- from a painting by Vernon Fisher depicting a father and son  cutting into a globe as if it were a pumpkin -- ties into the environmental  motif, as does a series of programs at the convention center.  </P> <P> Art fairs are complex productions that serve a variety of functions. For local  dealers, a fair is a chance to promote their galleries to a vast audience.  Recession or not, "this is our hometown fair. It's a major event," said Mark  Moore, owner of the Works Gallery.  </P></p>

			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / Spraying of oil slicks defended THE Department of Transport defended the practice of aerial spraying to counter coastal oil pollution when the government's contingency plans came under scrutiny at the Donaldson inquiry this week. The hearing is looking at the wider implications of the Braer tanker disaster off Shetland this year. There has been evidence that questions the government's emergency strategy which relies on aerial spraying as the first line of defence.

The inquiry continues.</p>

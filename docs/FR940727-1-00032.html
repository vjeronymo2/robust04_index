			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> EPA requests comment on industry and other source reduction initiatives involving the reduction of mercury in fluorescent lamps. Source reduction may be occurring through more efficient dosing techniques, lightweighting of lamps, and changes in phosphor powder technology. The Agency requests comments reflecting these and any other source reduction activities and may use this information to develop a strategy to support and encourage voluntary source reduction. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> III. Environmental Release and Fate <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> This section presents the technical information used by the Agency in developing options for the management of used mercury-containing lamps. Information is provided on the environmental fate and transport in the ground water and air pathway for mercury. Specifically, EPA has reviewed leachate data from municipal landfills and data on air emissions from municipal waste combustors and municipal landfills. In addition, the Agency has estimated possible releases of mercury to the air from lamps broken during storage and transportation. Most of the information considered pertains to management in municipal landfills. Information on other types of non-hazardous landfills is not presented due to a lack of data and the wide variability in design and waste composition of other non-hazardous landfills. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency requests comment on the data presented in this section of the preamble. These data, along with any data submitted in the public comment to this proposal, will be used to determine the risk to human health and the environment from the management of used mercury-containing lamps. Also, some information on the risks of managing mercury-containing lamps in landfills, combustors and recovery facilities was submitted to the Agency in response to a request for such information in the Universal Waste Proposal (February 11, 1993, 58 FR 8102). This information is included in the rulemaking docket for today's proposal and the Agency requests comment on it. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 --> A. Groundwater Impacts <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> This section discusses leachate samples collected by EPA from municipal landfills. As previously discussed, the Agency is further developing its groundwater model under the TC to accurately predict the movement of mercury through the groundwater system. The groundwater pathway for mercury is being considered because the TC uses the groundwater pathway to estimate the movement of contaminants from municipal landfills. The leachate data indicate that further analysis may be needed on the behavior and movement of mercury in municipal landfills and in groundwater, although initial analyses indicate that mercury is less mobile than previously believed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA has collected data indicating that mercury may not leach from MSW landfills at levels above the drinking water MCL, despite some mercury disposal in MSW landfills. EPA estimates that approximately 73% of municipal solid waste (MSW) is placed in municipal landfills, while 14% of municipal solid waste is incinerated and 13% is recycled. Based on a study of mercury production and use, the Agency estimates that about 643 metric tons (Mg) of mercury is discarded in MSW landfills per year. A major source of mercury in municipal solid waste is household batteries which accounts for about 88% of the 565 metric tons (Mg) of mercury in municipal solid waste. Most of these batteries fall under the Household Waste Exclusion (see 45 FR 33119, May 19, 1980). Thermostats/thermometers and mercury-containing lamps are second in their contribution of mercury in municipal solid waste, 3.9% and 3.8% respectively. The Agency estimates that, assuming all lamps are disposed of in MSW landfills, approximately 20 Mg of mercury would be placed in MSW landfills per year from used mercury-containing lamps. (U.S. EPA, 1991c). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Data on the amounts of mercury in MSW landfill leachate are included in a study summarizing the available data on MSW landfill leachate characteristics conducted by the Office of Solid Waste (U.S. EPA, 1988). Out of 109 leachate mercury analyses collected, only six (7 percent) were above the drinking water level or maximum contaminant level (MCL) for mercury (0.002 mg/L) and none were above the Toxicity Characteristic (TC) limit for mercury (0.2 mg/L). The average of these MSW leachate analyses was 0.0008 mg/L mercury. The maximum concentration reported is 0.0098 mg/L. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Further analysis indicates that less than 0.01 percent of the mercury in MSW landfills leaches from the landfill. This estimate is supported by a study measuring mercury disposition (in landfill gas and leachate) in four Swiss landfills which found around .007 percent of the mercury from the landfill in the leachate (Baccini et al., 1987). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The behavior of mercury in a MSW landfill is not known in great detail. The complexity of aqueous mercury chemistry makes it difficult to predict and model at this time. However, the available information suggests that chemical conditions tend to favor the metallic form of mercury in MSW landfills. This form has a lower solubility in water (0.02&hyph;0.04 mg/L) than other chemical forms. In addition, EPA has identified studies that indicate that municipal solid waste has a significant capacity for retaining mercury in the landfill unless there are unusually large quantities of mercury in municipal solid waste (Gould et al., 1988/Mennerich, 1985). The Agency has not seen field data for industrial non-hazardous landfills. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Isidre Ambros and Pau Baquero: "Gonzalez Admits </F> That There Is a Crisis in Council's Functioning"]    [Text] Corfu -- Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez  acknowledged yesterday that the European leaders' failure in  their attempt to agree on a candidate to replace Delors  represents "a clear crisis in the European Council's  functioning," while admitting that the veto imposed by John  Major could lead to an institutional conflict to which "I can  see no easy solution."    The news conference at which Gonzalez analyzed the Corfu  Council virtually centered on the issue of the candidate to  succeed Delors as Commission president. Gonzalez acknowledged  that the summit's outcome produced an outcome that was  "bittersweet with evident light and shade."    The Spanish head of government explained his efforts to try  to reach a consensus among the Twelve. During the dinner on  Friday [24 June] evening, Gonzalez said that he believed that  there was an agreement for nobody to veto anybody, "which seemed  to me a very good thing. We delegations accepted the  presidency's proposal that we vote according to preference.  There were 11 ballot papers with the order of the three  candidates and one on which there were just two candidates, and  none of them was Brittan."    Yesterday morning, Gonzalez met with Lubbers, "and I asked  him to withdraw," as Brittan also did, but Major maintained his  veto, but not the Netherlands, which said that it was prepared  to accept a consensus of the Twelve on Dehaene. Gonzalez  described the current situation as "unpleasant," and said that  he found the alternative of seeking new candidates, as Major  proposed, "very complicated."    The Spanish prime minister would not enter into assessments  as to whether the British prime minister's stance was due to  reasons of domestic politics in the United Kingdom -- not  reasons of a European nature, but he did make it clear that  "yesterday evening I understood that the possibility of a veto  was ruled out, and this morning (yesterday), Britain has imposed  one."    Gonzalez said that he could not see the reasons why Major  was  prepared to accept Lubbers but not Dehaene, since they are both  Christian Democrats and there are no qualitative differences  between their ideas of what Europe should be like. He even  pointed out in this connection that Lubbers was the architect of  the Maastricht treaty, so much criticized by London in some of  its chapters.  <H5>  Rule of Consensus </H5>   Asked whether there was not a certain weariness in the  European Council because it is Britain that periodically blocks  important decisions in the European building process, Gonzalez  said: "If there is no consensus, there may be greater or lesser  irritation among the countries, but we must all accept the  rules. The rules require consensus, but the countries that do  not accept this should make an effort at rapprochement, which I  admit is not obligatory."    Gonzalez did not rule out the deadlock's continuing, and  conjectured that either a solution will be reached in 20 days at  the special summit that the German presidency will foreseeably  call, or there will be no choice but to seek alternative  candidates. With respect to the criticisms leveled against  Paris and Bonn of lack of openness in proposing Dehaene as a  candidate, Gonzalez recalled that he was the prime minister who  supported a candidate and maintained his support for Lubbers to  the end. "It could be said that we supported a candidate who  did not win, but it must also be emphasized that we have  maintained our independence of judgment, and that that possible  lack of openness did not influence our vote," he said.    Asked for an assessment of Berlusconi, Gonzalez was very  cautious. "I already knew him, and perhaps because of that he  has felt closer to me. As you know, it is complicated to enter  into the ways meetings like this work," he concluded.  <H5>  Felipe Reiterates That He Will Not Be Candidate for </H5> Commission Presidency    Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez recalled during the news  conference that he has been repeating over the past two years  that he would not be a candidate for the EC presidency when  Jacques Delors leaves the post. With the crisis over this  European politician's succession open in the European Union  right now, some observers believe that Gonzalez could be a  candidate accepted by all the Union's member countries.    "In a situation of some economic and political difficulty  such as our country is experiencing, I reaffirm even more my  decision to fulfill my obligations as prime minister and not to  be a candidate," Gonzalez flatly asserted. He then added that  "what has worried me most about the deadlock situation from the  personal viewpoint is that it could reopen in an alternative  direction and reach me. I hope that this will be understood,  especially by those who must understand it -- the Spanish  public."    The Spanish prime minister concluded his thoughts on this  issue by stating that "some people tell me that the European  Commission presidency would be a brilliant solution for the next  five years, but I believe that my prime duty is to try to  resolve our country's problems and contribute to European  building from that position -- not from another."</p>

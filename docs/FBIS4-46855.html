			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Svetlana Svetlanova: "We Eat and Drink Any Old </F> Thing and Sometimes -- We Poison Ourselves: Is the Law on  Protection of Consumers' Rights in Russia Really in Force?"]    [Text] It is no secret: in the last three or four  years the quality level of domestic products has fallen. Boris  Migachev, general director of the Russian Testing and  Certification Center, has stated this repeatedly.    It is a paradox: 57 certification organizations and 152  testing laboratories are fighting over the important task of  making our products meet safety and medical-biological norms.  Moreover, this struggle is not without its banner. In fact,  there is, after all, a Law on Protection of Consumers' Rights.    Almost 90 percent of the foodstuffs and 70 percent of  industrial products are certified. It is a bit worse with  imported goods: in 1993, Rostest rejected... one percent of the  goods. And in general not because the rest were "okay."    Is satisfaction too expensive?.... It turns out that the  price of a certificate issued by Rostest at the request of  enterprises for a food product "stretches" to 80,000 rubles [R].  This includes the cost of tests and services upon conclusion of  the expert examination.    Meanwhile, is the consumer chewing up unfit cheese and  washing it down with unfit milk? The quality of the products  supplied from many CIS countries is very bad. As Migachev  stated, however, "beginning on 1 July, barriers will be set up."    It is curious: throughout Russia... there is no figure on  rejected goods. Even though the consumer tested on his own skin  (and repeatedly) the carelessness of the suppliers. ZIL, for  instance -- it produced a microwave oven, which Rostest  immediately rejected. The Krugozor Toy Factory was reprimanded  for violation of the production process. Some products of the  Mikoyanov Meat Combine and the Cherkizovo Dairy Combine were  rejected.    Forty Western firms have now turned to Rostest with a  request  to certify their products. Eighteen German washing machines are  being tested. Let us hope that Moscow has every opportunity of  testing products. One thing is particularly depressing: The  hawkers and kiosk attendants "pass around" quite a few fake  certificates. The general director of Rostest therefore appeals  to us to be on the alert. If you don't want them to cheat you --  ask for a certificate. Not just any one. Be sure that the form  has the seal and logo of the Rostest representative on it.</p>

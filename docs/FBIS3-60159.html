"The make quick incursions using light planes to collect  drugs, usually from clandestine airstrips," Soliz said.    The secretary told journalists that the police are unable to  interdict those flights because they are small, random,  difficult to detect, and do not follow a set timetable.    Soliz Valenzuela said the constant violation of Bolivian  airspace occurs because the borders are long and "difficult to  control."    He said: "The presence of Colombian drug cartels in Bolivia  is of obvious concern because they encourage cocaine paste  production."    He added, however, that our authorities are doing everything  necessary to prevent it from getting out of control.    Asked about reports on abuses involving DEA agents, Soliz  said there are no specific reports that can be investigated.    "Reports are made in general terms. No one has mentioned  names or specific cases, otherwise we would have acted  immediately and punished those responsible," Soliz said.    He said the government does not know how many DEA agents  operate in the country.    "I will ask the DEA coordinator in the country for a  complete  report to find out how many operate in Bolivia," Soliz concluded.</p>

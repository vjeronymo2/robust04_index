			<p>910415 FT  15 APR 91 / Letter: Unfree market Sir, Your front-page report of April 10, 'Gorbachev seeks ban on strikes and protests', surely represents the greatest dialectical contradiction yet in the Russian crisis. Even in the midnight of the century of the Stalinist terror of the 1930s, strikes were not officially banned and did indeed break out from time to time. What can we make of an economy that is meant to be embracing the free market but at the same seeks to outlaw attempts by labour to influence that market. Not even Mrs Thatcher tried to ban a miners' strike. Keith Flet, 4 Blake Road, New Southgate, N11</p>

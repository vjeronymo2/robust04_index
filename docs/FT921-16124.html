			<p>920106 FT  06 JAN 92 / Serb enclave rejects UN troops plan THE Yugoslav army and Croatian forces held to a ceasefire yesterday but Serb leaders of a key region appeared set to spell trouble for UN plans to deploy peace-keeping forces, Reuter reports from Belgrade. The leader of the Serb enclave of Krajina, standard-bearer of Serb resistance in Croatia, rejected deployment of UN troops in the territory itself, saying they could be stationed only on its borders. Mr Milan Babic, Krajina's president, said in a message sent to the UN envoy, Mr Cyrus Vance, and the Security Council, that Serb irregulars there would not lay down their arms while Croatia's National Guard retained theirs. He also questioned why units of the Serb-led federal army had to be withdrawn  - another key element in the peace plan. 'We would remind everyone that the internal arrangement and the maintenance of public order is exclusively within the competence of. . . Krajina and no one has any right to settle those matters in a different way,' Mr Babic said. Krajina, a wedge of territory in the heart of Croatia, unilaterally declared independence from the republic last month and now styles itself 'the Serbian Republic of Krajina'. Under the UN plan, 'Blue Helmet' troops would be deployed in Krajina and other Serb enclaves in Croatia, irregular forces would be disarmed and units of the army and Croatian National Guard would be withdrawn. Mr Babic's opposition touched off a row with the political leadership of Serbia and the federal presidency which, with Croatia, have accepted the plan. Mr Borisav Jovic, the Serbian member of the presidency, accused Krajina leaders of backtracking after initially agreeing with Serbia to accept the terms of the UN plan. Mr Vance says he will recommend deployment of the UN force if a Friday night ceasefire between the Yugoslav federal army and the Croatian National Guard really takes hold. Both the army and Croatian forces yesterday reported the quietest night for months, with no serious violations of the ceasefire and all battlefronts quiet yesterday. More than 6,000 people have been killed in fighting since Croatia declared independence from Yugoslavia last June. In New York, Mr Vance discussed prospects for a peace-keeping force with Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general. He later said he hoped the new ceasefire, the 15th in the conflict, would hold and indicated any deployment of UN troops might be weeks away. 'One can tell if you watch over a period of days, and perhaps even weeks, as to whether or not it is going to stick,' he said. His recommendations to the Security Council this week will be crucial.</p>

The election was a crucial test for Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa because it was the first gubernatorial election fought  between the seven ruling coalition parties and the LDP since the  Hosokawa government took office last August, throwing the LDP  into opposition after 38 years of unbroken rule.    Former Vice Gov. Masanori Tanimoto, 48, was backed by the  Social Democratic Party (SDP), Komeito, Shinseito [Japan Renewal  Party], the Japan New Party (JNP), the Democratic Socialist  Party (DSP), new party Sakigake [Harbinger] and the United  Social Democratic Party. Tanimoto defeated LDP-backed Hiroshi  Ishikawa, 51, a former House of Councillors member, and Japanese  Communist Party-backed Takashi Shimizu, 51, a doctor.    The election was held to fill the post vacated following the  death of Yoichi Nakanishi.    Tanimoto garnered 283,992 votes while Ishikawa had 275,854  votes and Shimizu 47,624 votes as of 10:50 P.M. with 98 percent  of the votes counted, Election Administration Committee  officials said. The officials said 70.9 percent of some 887,000  eligible voters turned out.    During the election campaign, Hosokawa and LDP President  Yohei Kono both visited the prefecture to canvas for votes.    The election was regarded as a prelude to a House of  Councillors election next year, and the next general election,  as well as a litmus test of election cooperation among coalition  parties in a single-seat electoral district.    The Diet has enacted a package of political reform bills to  replace the current multiseat constituency system for the lower  house with the combination of single-seat district and  proportional representation.    The implication of the election result is expected to give  an  impetus to a coalition move to create a new party to fight  jointly against the LDP in other elections, political analysts  said. Shinseito and Komeito have advocated merging coalition  partners into a single party, while the SDP, Sakigake and the  DSP call for a "moderate multiparty system."    The governor's race was also seen as a proxy war between  Keiwa Okuda, chairman of the lower house steering committee and  a key member of Shinseito and LDP Secretary General Yoshiro  Mori. Both Okuda and Mori have been elected from the No. 1  constituency in the prefecture.</p>

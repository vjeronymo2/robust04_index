			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In commenting on the NPRM, AAMA stated that it supported a limited exclusion for vehicles with low U.S./Canadian parts content, although at a 15 percent content level rather than 35 percent. AAMA also stated that since the agency ``has implied that it has the authority to set a minimal level for the U.S. and Canadian content which removes a recordkeeping burden on the low end of content, it urged that such relief also be provided for the high end of content. That organization recommended that, for carlines with more than 85 percent U.S./Canadian content, manufacturers be permitted to specify the content as ``at least'' 85 percent instead of specifying a percentage.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The foreign vehicle manufacturers strongly supported a limited exclusion for vehicles with low U.S./Canadian parts content. However, several of them argued that unless the agency also permits a limited exclusion from providing the information required for item two of the label, i.e., the percentage parts content originating from major sources of foreign content, there would be only a minimal benefit from an exclusion from specifying the percentage U.S./Canadian parts content. This is because the foreign manufacturers would have to collect detailed information from most of their suppliers to calculate the information for item two of the label. The foreign manufacturers suggested various alternative approaches, such as requiring them to specify the countries that constitute major sources of foreign content but not the percentages from such countries.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since publishing the NPRM, the agency has completed the analysis of its authority to provide exclusions from the Labeling Act requirements. For reasons which are summarized below, NHTSA has concluded that it does not have the authority to provide exclusions from the express statutory labeling requirements for either vehicles with low U.S./Canadian content or vehicles with high U.S./Canadian content. As discussed in the next section of this preamble, however, the agency may provide limited exclusions for multi-stage manufacturers and low volume manufacturers, based on the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> de minimis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  doctrine.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As discussed above, the Labeling Act expressly requires manufacturers to label each vehicle with five items of information: (1) The `` <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> percentage <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> '' U.S./Canadian parts content; (2) the names of foreign countries providing at least 15 percent of the parts content and the `` <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> percentage <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> '' for each such country; (3) final assembly point; and (4) and (5) countries of origin for the engine and transmission. Items (1) and (2) are calculated on a ``carline'' basis. See section 210(b)(1).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There is a limit to the degree of precision in the percentages required by the Labeling Act. Section 210(b)(2) provides that ``[t]he percentages required to be indicated by this section may be rounded to the nearest 5 percent by the manufacturers.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To implement these and other requirements, section 210(d) requires the Secretary to:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Promulgate such regulations as may be necessary to carry out this section *&blank;*&blank;* Such regulations shall provide to the ultimate purchaser of a new passenger motor vehicle the best and most understandable information possible about the foreign and U.S./Canada origin of the equipment of such vehicles without imposing costly and unnecessary burdens on the manufacturers.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Labeling Act does not provide any express authority to create exclusions from the statutory requirements which apply to vehicle manufacturers. NHTSA notes that while section 210(d) provides that the regulations must not impose costly and unnecessary burdens on manufacturers, this is not an invitation for the agency to second-guess Congress about the requirements it has established regarding the specific content information which must be provided to consumers. As a matter of statutory construction, the agency notes that general provisions cannot be construed as overriding specific ones. Since all of the exclusions identified above are inconsistent with the statutory language, the relevant legal question is whether NHTSA has implied authority to create the exclusions notwithstanding such language.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Where a statute does not provide express authority to create exclusions, there are only two circumstances recognized by the courts in which an agency has implied authority to create exclusions. The first is administrative need, related to an agency's inability to carry out a mandate fully, and the second is  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> de minimis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  circumstances, where following the plain meaning of a statute would lead to ``absurd or futile results'' or to ``a gain of trivial or no value.'' The courts indicate that both bases for exclusions from the clear command of a statute are disfavored and that agencies bear a strong burden of proof in attempting to show that adhering to a statute would have the effects described above.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since exclusions are not necessary for the agency to carry out its mandate, the only relevant issue is whether the exclusions can be justified on the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> de minimis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  theory. The exclusions cannot be justified if non-trivial benefits are provided by a regulation in those circumstances.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA has concluded that it does not have authority to provide the above-discussed exclusions from the express statutory labeling requirements for either vehicles with low U.S./Canadian content or vehicles with high U.S./Canadian content because the exclusions would permit the labels on a substantial portion of the vehicles sold to provide the consumer with significantly less information than Congress intended, thereby eliminating much of the benefit that the Labeling Act was intended to provide.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For example, a ``low-end'' exclusion would permit a large percentage of foreign vehicles to be labeled with the words ``minimal'' or less than 35 percent (or some other specified percentage) U.S./Canadian content, instead of being labeled with a specific percentage. Consumers would not know whether vehicles bearing such labels contained (on a carline basis) 0 percent, about 15 percent, or possibly even nearly 35 percent U.S./Canadian content. A consumer wishing to make a purchase decision among vehicles bearing such labels would not be able to compare their U.S./Canadian content. Similarly, a ``high-end'' exclusion would permit most domestic vehicles to be labeled with the words ``greater than 85% U.S./Canadian content.'' A consumer wishing to make a purchase decision among vehicles bearing such labels would not be able to compare their U.S./Canadian content.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA notes that section 210(b)(2) allows rounding of the percentages, but limits the rounding ``to the nearest five percent.'' This indicates that specific percentages must be listed (since general percentages aren't amenable to rounding) and that any rounding to a greater degree is prohibited. In this regard, it is particularly important to note that the degree of permissible rounding permitted by the enacted version of section 210 is significantly less than the degree that would have been permitted in the introduced version. In the introduced version, rounding would have been permitted to the nearest 10 percent. The enacted version permits rounding only to the nearest 5 percent. Thus, Congress focused particular attention on the issue of rounding and decided to adopt strict limits. Moreover, implicit in the enacted rounding provision is a judgment by Congress that differences in content of as little as five percentage points are significant enough to be considered by the consumer. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Blantyre, May 29 (AFP) -- Malawi's outspoken trade  unionist and opposition leader, Chakufwa Chihana, has accused  President Bakili Muluzi of failing to unite the country, divided  on regional lines since May 17 general elections.    Chihana, leader of the Alliance for Democracy (AFORD), who  was in third place in the presidential elections, said Muluzi  had done nothing to unite the country, state radio reported  Sunday [29 May].    Speaking to reporters in the northern district of Rumphi,  where he has his powerbase, Chihana called for unity talks  between Muluzi and ex-president Kamuzu Banda and himself.    The densely-populated south voted overwhelmingly for Muluzi  who comes from a southern district of Machinga, while the thinly  populated north voted for Chihana, and Banda drew his votes from  the central region, where he comes from -- setting the scene for  regional division.    "People voted because Muluzi or Chihana comes from that  area," said Muluzi last week, worried that his ruling United  Democratic Front (UDF) party did not win any parliamentary seat  in the north.    Coalition talks between Muluzi's party and AFORD collapsed  last week. UDF have ruled out any coalition with Banda's Malawi  Congress Party.    UDF, which won 84 of the 177 parliamentary seats, has formed  a minority government after failing to secure at least 89 seats  to make 51 percent of the working majority in parliament.    AFORD with 36 seats and the MCP with 55, make a stronger  opposition in parliament with 91 votes.</p>

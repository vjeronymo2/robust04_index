			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Third of three installments of an interview with </F> Subcommander Marcos of the Zapatist National Liberation Army,  EZLN, by correspondent Epigmenio Ibarra in the Lacandona jungle  in June; date not given; first three paragraphs are LA JORNADA  introduction; quotation marks as published]    [Text] According to Subcommander Marcos, the National  Democratic Convention convened by the EZLN is the proper  alternative to prevent what is regarded as an imminent outbreak  of violence. It is the responsibility of all political forces  to choose that alternative, Marcos points out. "If the  political parties take the wrong stand on the convention, they  will eventually take the wrong stand on the war, which will blow  up in their faces again sooner or later," he insists. He  continues to say that the convention, for the time being,  "offers the only opportunity to unite a scattered civilian  movement with an isolated but localized military movement," thus  forcing "a peaceful transition or at least making the military  phaseout less bloody."    "Why should someone who demands freedom, justice, and  democracy be labeled a dreamer," he wonders. He says that the  convention, "this crossroads, this point of convergence with  civilian society, organized or disorganized, is the first item  on the EZLN agenda."    In this third installment of an interview held in the  Lacandona Jungle, Marcos reaffirms the need for the union of  "civilian and military revolutionaries." Asked if he still has  hopes, Marcos answers: "Under the circumstances, that is the  only thing that can keep us on our feet and alive. The problem  now is to find out whether this hope has a trigger or a ballot."    [Ibarra] Any hope of holding the convention?    [Marcos] It would be premature to say. For the time being,  we feel the convention offers the only opportunity to unite a  scattered civilian movement with an isolated or localized  military movement. We believe that the convention, inasmuch as  it represents the convergence of military and civilian efforts  toward the same purpose, can still bring about a peaceful  transition or at least make the military phaseout less violent.    [Ibarra] There is an electoral process under way. Political  forces are challenging each other. For instance, why can the  PRD [Party of the Democratic Revolution] not say: I am betting  on the convention, not the elections, or the PAN [National  Action Party]? What would happen if those organized political  forces did not cooperate?    [Marcos] The political parties must start from reality. The  media have pointed out that none of the parties has succeeded in  achieving a consensus among those who abstain. That is to say,  the parties are facing a very high degree of abstentionism and  will share the votes. According to the official list, there are  between 45 and 50 million registered voters, but everyone is  taking it for granted that at least half of them will not vote.  In other words, the parties will have to share between 22 and  25 million votes. According to the most optimistic estimates,  the winning candidate will receive between 9 and 12 million  votes. The winner will have to govern in an ungovernable  climate. In other words, the winner will receive between 15 and  20 percent of the vote at most. Whether he likes it or not, his  government will be a minority. If I were the winning  candidate, I would be seriously concerned about that 50 percent,  the more than 20 million people who will not vote because they  are not interested in politics or elections or because they  believe in violence. I would not say they would necessarily  take up arms, but they would look favorably on an armed  movement, one that could break up the electoral system.    The political parties are aiming in the wrong direction, at  those who are determined to vote and will vote. We aim at those  who will not. If the political parties take the wrong stand  regarding the convention, they will eventually take the wrong  stand on the war, which will blow up in their faces again sooner  or later. That 50 percent of registered voters who will not  vote represents the potential for war. That is how we see it.    [Ibarra] Does this have the potential for passivity and  conformism?    [Marcos] Our analysis is based on this group. Passivity and  conformism are a force that will go in one way or another. It  could be the balance will tilt in one direction and things will  remain the same, but the balance could also tilt toward war if  the group, in one way or another, decides: "Well, let there be a  war. We will not do anything to stop it." Isolated groups or,  as they are called, groups of lunatics could start mobilizing  and encouraging the other millions of Mexicans in that 50  percent to move to a more radical and permanent option.    [Ibarra] Mexico had a convention in the past, the  Aguascalientes Convention. Are you urging a convention as part  of a revolutionary tradition, or do you believe you can carry  out a task similar to the one undertaken at the Aguascalientes  Convention in the past?    [Marcos] We believe we can keep the task that was not  accomplished at the Aguascalientes Convention. Of course, it is  also part of the EZLN's historic right to call to this  convention. I want to tell you, I really want to insist to the  country that we are not resorting to foreign models to make our  demands or to further our political and military course. The  1914 Aguascalientes Convention was an effort to unite the  military and civilian movements of those times. The Zapatists  understood it in this manner, but they were defeated on this  issue at this convention. The 1914 Convention was an agreement,  or, rather, was an attempt to reach an agreement to get the  military forces to become civilian-oriented. The Zapatists of  those times insisted that it had to be an agreement between the  military forces and the civilians to further this transition,  but the revolutionary civilians and military forces did not  reach an agreement for several reasons. The objective of the  1994 Convention, to which we are calling, is to try to associate  or to hold a meeting between revolutionary civilians and  revolutionary military forces to initiate this passage to  democracy in Mexico.    [Ibarra] Other attempts are being made. The peace  commissioner himself was working hard to further an initiative  for a government of transition or a wide front for democracy.  What do you think of those efforts?    [Marcos] We view those efforts with skepticism because other  people's logic will say what is to be done, as they are the ones  who will make the summons a success. The government always says  it is successful in the measure that it appears in media  headlines. Political parties and other forces believe they are  advancing based on the amount of intellectuals in their groups  or the space the media gives them. This is how they appraise  the situation, but, later on, reality shows them they were  wrong. We are calling those who do not have space in the  newspapers, those who do not want to give conferences or write  in newspapers, those who are voiceless and faceless, as we have  said previously. We are calling them to this convention or to  reach this agreement between civilians and military forces.    "We do not reject this type of initiatives or fronts, but,  in  one way or another, if they are perceptive and honest, they will  have to converge and agree with the convention for which we are  calling or at least to reach an agreement regarding it."    [Ibarra] It is frequently said the isolation, the jungle,  the  years of struggle here can inhibit you from having a coherent,  cohesive vision of the future to design a project for the  country that can be offered to all of Mexico.    [Marcos] Regarding our historic blindness, I believe the  events between January and July have shown that if we do not  have much lucidity, there are others who are at least blinder  than we are. This is the EZLN's modest, or, better said, we  admit that the reality is: There is no project for the future of  the country. We are saying: Let us sit down and talk with those  who are going to have to carry out, to deal with, to confront or  organize the country's future. We have to sit down and talk  about it, and the place is at the convention. We have to reach  an agreement, to discuss what it is we want, and, in that sense,  the EZLN's voice will be one among the others. What worries us  greatly is: Why do they say a person is a utopian if he asks  for freedom, justice, and democracy? To what point have we  gotten in this country that we say a person who is fighting for  the most basic human rights is a utopian? To what point has  skepticism contaminated, poisoned people already?    [Ibarra] Are you referring to the skepticism?    [Marcos] Look, how can an army take up arms for freedom,  justice, and democracy and this be considered as utopian. We  want a democratic, free, and just country, and this is utopian?  What has happened to the people who think and write? What are  they doing with their thoughts, their work, their life? In what  way or up to what point has skepticism poisoned them? Is it to  the point that they say nothing is possible? In what measure is  this conformism or passivity?    "What we are trying to do is open a space so that, perhaps,  all the skepticism in the country will not necessarily become  skepticism to the nth power and to have the possibility of  realizing it is not a utopia but, rather, a right for which we  have to fight. In the worst case, all the revolutions have been  a utopia prior to being started, and all major changes in the  history of mankind have been a utopia the day before they became  a reality.    [Ibarra] What is the first point on the EZLN program at  this time?    [Marcos] The convention. All our efforts will now be focused  on establishing that bridge, that link of unity, that point of  consensus with civilian society, organized or unorganized. The  convention, if it materializes, is the only possibility for the  EZLN and the country to make a peaceful journey to democracy,  without violence.    [Ibarra] Weapons today are a guarantee of this peaceful  journey. Does the EZLN's existence change the outlook?    [Marcos] Yes, there is another option now. The option  before was: You either settle for what I offer or you will face  my weapons, that is, their weapons. We are now saying: You  either agree with the decision of a majority or settle for a  very long war that would wear down both parties, and we are the  only ones who have nothing to lose. We made no investments in  the stock market, and we have nothing to lose in this regard.  Those who have investments, prestige, and so on, need to be  careful; we do not. They either accept this decision imposed  through a peaceful means or accept that hell will last several  years.    [Ibarra] When we refer to hell and the possibility of the  explosion of a conflict, many talk about 22 August as the day  when this could happen. There could, however, also be some sort  of propaganda to frighten the people.    [Marcos] I think that January, well, actually the six months  of war, or armed truce, or armed peace, as some call it,  demonstrated once again the limits of the media, the limits of  propaganda. What started in January or February, I mean the  possibility of a new ethical code or a new way to handle the  media, finally resumed its course. Efforts that certain media  were making to democratize themselves to genuinely meet the  expectations started to disappear. There was an attempt to be  the protagonist; they were certain about their influence on  public opinion until we proved them wrong on 10 June 1994, when  we said no.    "Throughout that period, everyone insisted in the media that  the armed struggle was no option. I am glad that peace is on  the way, that there was already a negotiation, that it is only a  matter of time, and that there will be a spectacular signing. I  insist that faceless and nameless armed forces, which respond to  the EZLN, have grown throughout the country and in certain  sectors. If they are betting on propaganda, they are betting to  lose; if they are betting on television spots and newspaper  headlines, by the way, they will lose, and so will the media."    [Ibarra] Finally, you are talking to an atomized left wing.  You told them: Let us reach a consensus on what we do not want,  and later we will reach a consensus on what we want. Is this  possible? What project are you proposing to the left wing, and  what will be your stand toward the elections, which are just  round the corner? What will the EZLN do with its political and  moral strength? Who will receive it? Where will it channel it?    [Marcos] We do not know; this is quite a problem. We think  that historic time is going by faster than calendar time; the  historic time between 1 January and 10 June, when we said no to  the government proposals, that is, between the first and the  second Lacandona Jungle declarations. In terms of historic  time, it was very meaningful to this country. This means that  it is possible to make historic time run faster than calendar  time and that this process to achieve unity and agree on what we  do not want -- that we no longer want a state party -- includes  not only an atomized left wing, but that it could also lead the  middle class and important wealthy sectors.    "In one way or another, the clumsiness of the state party,  as  it promoted a neoliberal and arbitrary project at the political  level, also affected the interests of the high classes. I think  that the stand of saying no to the state party will find  supporters in broad sectors of the population. The problem  arises when we say: We want to be Maoists, Trotskyists,  orthodox, social Christians, democrats, centrists, and so on;  that is where problems start. When a person starts to say how  things should be, he starts, even unwillingly and spontaneously,  to divide and dissolve.    "But if we try to reach a consensus on what we do not want,  we believe we can participate. We may not be the leaders, but  we can participate in a broader movement under the common cause  of opposing the official party. We have had enough of the  official party and everything it implies. This historic time is  about to whom we should give our political support. We believe  many forces will establish their positions in the coming days,  even regarding the convention. Whom could we support, whom  could be the man to receive our support, or does a transition to  democracy have a name? I am telling you: We do not know any of  this yet. We would have to know if a leader such as Francisco  I. Madero will come forth in this historic time, given we are  referring to the historic past that nourishes the EZLN.    Finally, the EZLN is foreseeing that even if a leader is  missing, at least there will be, at the social and civic levels,  the need for a transition government and a new Constitution,  which regulates the new political relations. It would be good to  have a leader at the right time and the right moment. We cannot  commit our political endorsement, our support to someone unless  the historic moment indicates he is worthy of it. By historic  time, we mean the mobilizations and the explicit commitment to  assume the EZLN causes; otherwise, we could implicitly  acknowledge that or we could, in a given moment, raise those  causes. The EZLN believes a government must have a clear  commitment to advance the causes for which we rose up in arms.  Our causes are outlined in 11 points, which are mainly  encompassed in democracy, freedom, and justice.    [Ibarra] The EZLN would somehow be a force depending on  historic forces. It would be a catalyst, a thermometer.    [Marcos] We believe that does not mean there is a fever. The  EZLN is conducting an internal evaluation and is obtaining a  "negative" result. It is conducting an external evaluation at  two levels through the tables set up for consultations and  informal consultations, and the result is also "negative." We  believe this is right, that the measure was the correct one, and  that we must assess the situation again. We must again set the  thermometer for August, that is, from now until to August --  what will happen between now until August -- and examine whether  a peaceful transition is still possible. We are optimistic and  believe a peaceful transition is still possible. What concerns  us is whether a leader will come forth.    [Ibarra] The responsibility is no longer in your hands but  in  the hands of people in the cities and towns, people outside the  EZLN.    [Marcos] Definitely, because I must clarify that even in  military terms, we are not at a military disadvantage vis-a-vis  our situation in January. In other words, we are not weaker  militarily than in January, nor have we more to lose now than we  did then. On the contrary, in military terms, we have more  advantages: Our morale is higher now than in January; we have  more people now than then, and we have nothing to lose by  waiting and saying if you have another alternative try it. We  cannot do any worse than we did. In any event, whatever happens  will be better for us as an organization, as the EZLN.    "Time flies for the civilian sector; historic time flies. I  insist on that, because I always get answers based on a  calendar. I tell the government that if they would have thought  on 1 January of stopping the war in 12 days, they themselves  would have said it was not enough days, but I believe that had  they organized themselves, it would have been enough time. Now,  there is much effervescence, which could generate results at the  Convention."    [Ibarra] Do you have any hope?    [Marcos] Yes, definitely. Hope is the only thing that under  the current circumstances can still keep us alive and on our  feet. The problem now is determining whether that hope has a  trigger or a ballot.</p>

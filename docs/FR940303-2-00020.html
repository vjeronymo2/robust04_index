The possibility of significant environmental and socio-economic impacts as the result of the implementation of these potential flood damage reduction alternatives, necessitates the preparation of a Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) on the Levisa Fork Basin Flood Damage Reduction Plan, Kentucky and Virginia, to analyze these potential impacts. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES AND LOCATION:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> The Huntington District is scheduling a public scoping meeting on the Levisa Fork Basin Flood Damage Reduction Plan DEIS for 28 February 1994, at 6:30 p.m. The meeting will be held at the Birchleaf Elementary School in Birchleaf, Virginia.

Drum, (304) 529&hyph;5644 or Mr. Wallace E. Dean, (304) 529&hyph;5712. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Location and Description of Proposed Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The project area includes those floodplain areas that would be affected by a recurrence of the April 1977 flood within the Levisa and Russell Forks of the Big Sandy River Basin in Kentucky and Virginia. These floodplain areas extend from the confluence of Indian Creek and Russell Fork in Dickerson County, Virginia downstream on the Russell Fork to the confluence of the Russell Fork and Levisa Fork at Millard, Kentucky (a distance of approximately 50 miles) and from the downstream extent of the incorporated limits of the Town of Grundy, Virginia on the Levisa Fork to Louisa, Kentucky a distance of approximately 138 miles (excluding the area included within the Government property boundary of the Fishtrap Lake project in Pike County, Kentucky). Also included are the floodplain areas located along tributaries of the Russell and Levisa Forks that would be affected by backwater flooding from a recurrence of the April 1977 flood including mainstream and tributaries a total of approximately 220 stream miles are being investigated under the study. Approximately 4,500 structures are located within the floodplain areas being investigated under this study. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Components of Proposed Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A total of five (5) project alternatives have been formulated for reducing flood related damages in the Levisa Fork Basin. These five alternatives will be further studied under the authority of Section 202 of the Energy and Water Resources Development Appropriations Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96&hyph;367) to determine the most cost-effective method of reducing flood related damages in the basin. Project alternatives being evaluated under this study include a flood control dam with permanent pool located approximately 4.6 miles upstream from the Town of Haysi, Virginia on the Russell Fork, a ``dry'' flood control dam (no permanent pool) located approximately 4.6 miles upstream from the Town of Haysi, Virginia on the Russell Fork, voluntary nonstructural measures (floodproofing by raising structures in-place, ringwalls or veneer walls or permanent relocation of floodplain structures to flood-safe sites), no action and a flood control dam with permanent pool located approximately 4.6 miles upstream of the Town of Haysi, Virginia on the Russell Fork, that would include seasonal storage to facilitate downstream whitewater recreation uses in the Breaks of the Russell Fork. Flood warning and emergency evacuation systems will be included for all floodplain areas where nonstructural measures are proposed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Draft General Plan Supplement (GPS) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A draft General Plan Supplement (GPS) containing a summary of investigations with specific recommendations is currently scheduled for completion by February 1995, with a final report to be completed by January 1996. Public involvement will continue throughout the development of the DEIS in the form of workshops and information furnished to the local media. Federal, State, and local agencies, as well as, other affected and concerned organizations will be notified of all scheduled meetings through published notices in local newspapers and direct notification with concerned parties. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 4.

Potentially significant impacts are: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. Impacts on the present aquatic and terrestrial resources. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b.

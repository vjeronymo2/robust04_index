			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / Lang sets up advice panel on quangos Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, yesterday acted to stem criticism of the growing use of quangos in the National Health Service by creating a committee of leading public figures to advise him on appointments to health boards and NHS trusts. The new committee is chaired by Mr Norman Irons, the Scottish National party member who is lord provost of Edinburgh. Mr Alex Salmond, leader of the SNP, described Mr Lang's move as a humiliating climbdown forced by public concern over 'the stuffing of health-service quangos by Tory placemen'. The proliferation in Scotland of boards nominated by the Scottish secretary has aroused criticism because their members are not elected. It is said that they include disproportionate numbers of Conservatives in a country where only a quarter of the electorate voted Tory in the 1992 general election. Mr Lang said that he had sought a broader spread of political views among people on quangos after the general election, asking leaders of opposition parties to make nominations, inviting individuals to put themselves forward and seeking nominations from more outside organisations. The party leaders ignored the invitation but Mr Lang nominated people such as Mr Campbell Christie, general secretary of the Scottish Trades Union Congress, and Mrs Susan Baird, a former Labour lord provost of Glasgow, to NHS trust boards. Mr Lang said yesterday that 58 per cent of appointments made since the general election had been from among people nominated by themselves or outside bodies. About 40 per cent were women. The other members of the new committee are: Mrs Jean McFadden, former Labour leader of Glasgow District Council; the Rt Rev Mario Conti, Roman Catholic bishop of Aberdeen; Mr Hugh Morison, director general of the Scotch Whisky Association; and Dr Anthony Toft, president of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh. Mr George Robertson, shadow Scottish secretary, said: 'Appointing yet another quango to choose more quangos is no real answer in a democracy.' The answer was to establish a Scottish parliament to which boards would be accountable. There is no English equivalent of the committee, although the Department of Health is setting up a database of potential board members.</p>

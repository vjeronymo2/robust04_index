			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market report New York raw SUGAR prices were at fresh session lows in heavy late trading. The market was under pressure from the opening bell on technical liquidation following Tuesday's steep decline. The nearby May contract fell more than 0.5 cents a lb, touching a low of 10.81 cents a lb. London COCOA and COFFEE prices looked set to be winding down ahead of the Easter holidays. Uncertainty over whether the Ivory Coast, the world's biggest producer, would keep its threat not to market its mid-crop, especially given speculation over its size, was keeping prices under wraps, dealers said. The weakness in copper failed to unsettle the LME's other base metal contracts. Three-month ALUMINIUM touched a fresh 16-month low of Dollars 1,125 a tonne before edging back up to finish unchanged. LEAD and ZINC continued to draw support from recent mine cutbacks, and closed steadier. GOLD spent most of the day testing support on the London bullion market, but SILVER showed the most volatility of the precious metals - fund buying was prominent on dips but profit-taking prevented any gain from being sustained.

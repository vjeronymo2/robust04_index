			<p><P> March 16, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> ISLAMIC PANEL WON'T DOOM RUSHDIE  </P> <P> Islamic foreign ministers called today for "The Satanic Verses" to be withdrawn  but refused to back Iran's call for British author Salman Rushdie to be killed,  delegates to a meeting here said.  </P> <P> They said the Islamic Conference Organization told member states to boycott  Rushdie's publishers if they failed to withdraw the book and urged the  international community to pass laws protecting the beliefs of others. "This  publication transgresses all norms of civility and decency and is a deliberate  attempt to malign Islam and the venerated Islamic personality," delegates  quoted the organization's final declaration on the book as saying.  </P></p>

			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / Value of fraud charges at Pounds 632m THE VALUE of fraud charges brought in the UK courts was Pounds 632m in 33 separate cases during the first eight months of this year, figures in the Fraud Barometer produced by accountants KPMG Peat Marwick show. That compares with Pounds 671m in charges from 84 cases for all of last year. The firm said that fraud sentencing was inconsistent, with disproportionately harsher sentences going to professional advisers who abuse positions of trust, and to defendants aged under 40.</p>

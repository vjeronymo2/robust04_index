			<p>940104 FT  04 JAN 94 / Markets across world surge ahead to hit record levels Stock markets in Europe and south-east Asia have begun the new year in the same record-setting style with which they saw out 1993. Bourses in Frankfurt, Paris, Zurich, Amsterdam, Madrid, Brussels and Stockholm rose to record highs. London returns today after the new year break. The surge in European stock markets stretched from the fledgling markets of Athens and Istanbul, in the south, to Vienna and Warsaw in central Europe. Hong Kong led the Asian advance with a 1.7 per cent rise, while new peaks were set in Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Seoul, Manila and Jakarta. Bombay and Karachi completed the record-breaking run in Asia. The recent sustained rise in Asian and European markets has been underpinned by outflows of money from the US, where many investors believe equity markets have less potential for growth than those abroad. In contrast to the surge elsewhere, Wall Street was subdued yesterday. The market there largely ignored a positive report from the National Association of Purchasing Management and instead took its lead from a weak bond market. At noon, the Dow Jones industrial average was 5.31 lower at 3,748.78. A surge in US demand for German stocks helped Frankfurt's DAX index up 1.30 to 2,267.98 after an early, 30-point fall, in a show of confidence that many traders believe the market still has further potential to rise. Some investors were also building their hopes that Thursday's meeting of the Bundesbank Council will cut interest rates. However, many analysts believe that the authorities are unlikely to act this week, with some German financial centres closed on Thursday for the Epiphany holiday. Paris picked up after a quiet start, the CAC-40 index adding 22.34 to 2,290.56, while Amsterdam was led higher by technical considerations in otherwise quiet conditions. The new AEX index made its debut yesterday, having replaced the EOE index, and closed at 420.37, up from a rating of 414.27 last Thursday. Mr Frederick Hasslauer, an analyst at Bank Sal Oppenheim in Zurich, confirmed that European markets were being spurred higher by inflows of US money. He said: 'US fund managers . . . are buying in the European markets, because it is the current trend.' With the Tokyo market closed, Hong Kong remained the main Asian focus for buying by foreign investors. US institutions continued to fuel the market's rise, which saw turnover of more than HKDollars 9.2bn (Pounds 805m) during the session, compared with HKDollars 7.4bn last Friday. The Hang Seng index, which rose by 115 per cent in 1993, added 198.10 to close at 12,086.49. Many traditionally superstitious Chinese investors had seen the Hang Seng's final tally for last of 11,888.39, as a good omen: the Cantonese equivalent of 'three eights' is taken as a portent of growth and prosperity. A break through the 12,000 level in the Hang Seng had been seen as inevitable after the market's recent surge but many analysts had not expected the barrier to be breached until the run-up to the Lunar New Year, which this year runs from February 10-13. Yet even at the market's current levels, many investors are reluctant to take profits, setting their sights instead on a further rise in the Hang Seng to the 14,000 level. Market reports, Page 19</p>

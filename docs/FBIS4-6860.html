			<p>BFN     [Text] On 21 April, Takashi Onoda, chairman of the Marine  and Fire Insurance Association of Japan, Inc. [MFIAJ], in  reference to the fact that the insurance sector has become one  of the focal points in the Japan-U.S. framework trade talks,  said: "We are considering plans to set up a meeting ground  where officials from the private sector can hold discussions to  deepen their mutual understanding." Onoda, who is also  president of the Sumitomo Marine and Fire Insurance Co. Ltd.,  made the comment at a news conference held the same day. He  also disclosed there are plans to revise the existing system to  give easier access to membership in the MFIAJ for foreign  insurance companies which have entered the Japanese market.    The MFIAJ already holds meetings with foreign insurance  companies which have entered the Japanese market. Onoda,  however, feels these meetings have remained too routine. He  disclosed the MFIAJ is thus considering plans to set up a forum  where top-level meetings can be held to discuss a broad range of  topics. The plans are expected to materialize as early as this  coming summer.</p>

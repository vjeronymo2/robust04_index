			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 12 KYODO -- The latest statistics have  yet not proved that the economy has hit bottom and prolonged  political unrest may put a damper on public sentiment, Finance  Minister Hirohisa Fujii said Tuesday [12 April]. "The economy  is in a delicate stage" with both good and bad indicators, Fujii  repeated at a news conference after a morning cabinet meeting.    Fujii was referring to a monthly economic report endorsed at  the cabinet meeting. The report, compiled by the Economic  Planning Agency, said the economy remains sluggish but included  a phrase that some bright spots have emerged.    Fujii's cautious stance on the economy contrasts with that  of  Bank of Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno and many private  economists, who have recently suggested that the economy is  showing signs of bottoming out.    The finance minister said the political uncertainty "is  certainty not favorable" for corporate and consumer sentiment.  He called for a settlement as soon as possible of the issue of  choosing a successor to Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, who  announced his intention to resign last Friday.    Concerning tax reform, Fujii said, "the direction and track  indicated by the Hosokawa cabinet will be inherited by any new  cabinet."    "Tax reform should become the mainstay of any new cabinet,"  he said. The government has pledged to conduct a full tax  reform, including permanent income tax cuts, by the end of the  year, and promised in its March market-opening package to  present details of the tax reform plan in June.    Legislators of both the ruling parties and the opposition  Liberal Democratic Party attached a provision to include  permanent tax cuts in the tax reform when they enacted a  single-year tax cut bill in March.</p>

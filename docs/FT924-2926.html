			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / Personal View: To Russia with resolve The International Monetary Fund has been actively involved in helping Russia and other states of the former Soviet Union (FSU) find solutions to their pressing economic and financial problems. This is one of the greatest challenges in the IMF's 48-year history. The transformation from a centrally planned to a market economy is a profoundly difficult task for two reasons. First, restructuring or replacing existing industry will take time and financial resources, which are particularly scarce. Second, there is a need to build the institutions necessary for a market economy to function efficiently. Basic institutions, such as a modern financial sector and a functioning system of commercial law, did not exist. Therefore, economic and institutional transformation has to be comprehensive, rather than piecemeal. Not surprisingly, the early results have been mixed. There are some encouraging signs. Market behaviour by producers is becoming more widespread. The government's privatisation programme is gaining momentum. New private businesses are being created all the time. However, serious strains have also emerged. With the collapse of the old system of central planning and the disruption of trade flows within the FSU, output has declined sharply. Considerable parts of the existing industrial plant cannot survive without assistance, and domestic political pressures to maintain output and employment are strong. The result has been excessive budget subsidies and credit expansion to finance loss-making enterprises. There is now a real danger that inflation will escalate into hyperinflation unless the Russian authorities act vigorously to reimpose financial discipline. And hyperinflation would threaten to wipe out all the gains made so far, and jeopardise the reform process itself. These developments point to the only practical way out of the present economic crisis: stabilise the macroeconomic situation; press ahead with the whole array of structural reform measures, including corporatisation and privatisation, enterprise restructuring and financial sector reform, market-oriented legal, institutional and accounting reforms, and improved enterprise management. At the same time, resist the temptation to reintroduce non-market methods such as price controls and large subsidies; ensure that the social safety net is adequate so that the human cost of higher unemployment, which will be inevitable, is tolerable, but not so expensive as to undermine budgetary stability. The IMF is actively working with the Russian authorities to make progress in all these areas. First, it approved Dollars 1bn in credits in August. As a second step, it is currently negotiating an economic reform and macroeconomic stabilisation programme that may be supported by more financial assistance. Unfortunately, this is taking longer than expected, because of the authorities' inability so far to decide on firm monetary and fiscal policies. The third phase, which may involve a Dollars 6bn fund to stabilise the rouble, will begin when conditions are more favourable. IMF technical experts are also active in advising on macroeconomic policies, structural reforms and the social safety net. At present as much as a third of the IMF's worldwide technical assistance effort is being devoted to Russia and other FSU countries. The IMF is also making an extraordinary commitment of human resources. The unprecedented concentration of effort is clear evidence of the priority that the IMF is giving to these countries. The IMF is not alone, by any means. The response of the community of nations to Russia's appeal for help has been very positive. Last April, the US and Germany announced a Dollars 24bn package of external financial assistance for Russia for 1992. Excluding the Dollars 6bn for a stabilisation fund (which will become available only in the third stage of IMF assistance), it is now expected that the total amount of assistance, including grants, export credits, humanitarian aid and debt relief, will approach Dollars 18bn. In terms of technical assistance, many international institutions and governments have been providing experts. In addition, many private companies, consultancies and non-profit-making bodies have been making available their skills and know-how. It could be argued that donors and creditors should have been even more generous. But it certainly cannot be claimed, as some observers have done, that the response in 1992 has fallen short of promises. At the IMF, we harbour no illusions about the scale of the problem, the possible setbacks and the time needed to complete the task. We understand the temptation to slow down the pace of reform. But we believe that this would only create worse problems in the future. It is better to take the difficult decisions at the beginning of the process, to set the economy on the right path from the outset. The author is director of the IMF's European II department</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Latvian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Today, on the second and last day of his visit,  Polish President Lech Walesa met the Saeima Chairman Anatolijs  Gorbunovs. After talks, the distinguished guest addressed the  Saeima deputies. Walesa pointed out that the visit had fulfilled  its purpose, because it had once again affirmed the diplomatic  relations between the two countries, giving a sincere and  friendly character to the official declarations. The Polish  president noted that there is much in common in the histories of  Latvia and Poland. Both countries fell victim to the brutality  of Hitler and the Soviet Union. Walesa noted that the Polish  Government in exile, the legitimate representatives of the  nation, never recognized the annexation of Latvia.    Addressing the Saeima deputies, the Polish president noted  that the two countries are currently solving similar problems of  a political, economic, and social nature. Mutual cooperation by  the two countries can assist in solving Latvia's economic  problems. Walesa noted with satisfaction that the authorities in  the Republic of Latvia have guaranteed the Polish minority the  opportunity to develop undisturbed and preserve their national  qualities. For this, I want to express here in your parliament  my sincere gratitude.    The Polish president expressed the hope that his visit will  help to create all-round cordial relations between Poland and  Latvia.    Afterwards, a speech in response was made by Saeima Chairman  Anatolijs Gorbunovs:    [Begin Gorbunovs recording] Highly esteemed president of  Poland, I wish to thank you for your address. I think that I  express the thoughts of the deputies as well in declaring my  satisfaction that you, highly esteemed president, have during  your visit attended the Saeima of the Republic of Latvia. I  especially wish to pay my respects to you, because your name is  undeniably inscribed in the recent history of the  transformations in Europe. We know that the processes that at  present seem objective and inevitable, at the time, for the  initiators of these transformations, demanded very much. At  that time, Polish Solidarity, under your leadership, boldly  showed the way that had to be undertaken by the other countries  of Central and Eastern Europe. No less responsibility rests upon  us today, when along with painful economic reforms, countries  that recently returned to the company of free nations are  seeking a way to stand together with the big developed countries  on the map of common European security. All the more so because  Latvia, like Poland, is conscious of being fully entitled to be  a shaper of the new democratic Europe today and in the future.  We fully concur with the idea expressed by you, Mr. President,  that we must cope with the demands posed by the new times and  the new situation in Europe. As Latvia is step by step being  connected to the circuit of Europe, we see in Poland one of our  closest partners. With great attention we have been following  your country's experience of political and economic reforms, and  what you have achieved has given us great hope. Let me wish  success to you, to the whole Polish nation, in realizing those  aims that you put forward on the way to prosperity, peace, and  security. May your visit to Latvia serve the growth of our  nations and our countries. [end recording]    That was the speech in response to the Polish president by  Saeima Chairman Anatolijs Gorbunovs.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Viktor Orban, chairman of the Federation of </F> Young Democrats, by Imre Bednarik; place and date not given:  "New Age in Hungary"]    [Text] It is perfectly clear that one of the most  important periods of Hungarian transition has ended. A new age  is beginning in Hungary because it has become obvious that  people's political taste is completely different from what it  was four years ago. It is the job of the Federation of Young  Democrats [Fidesz] to assess the situation and to launch a new  program on this basis, Fidesz Chairman Laszlo Orban told PESTI  HIRLAP.    [Bednarik] Do you agree with the statement that the Fidesz  is one of the biggest, if not the biggest, loser in the  elections because, although it is an opposition party, it did  not even manage to reach its 1990 results in the first round of  the elections?    [Orban] I agree, but with the note that, nevertheless, it  was the government parties that lost most. It is also certain  that the Fidesz's performance was way below expectations and in  this sense we are indeed the losers of these elections.    [Bednarik] On the night of the elections, reacting to the  results, you said that the country wanted a major correction  rather than the half-turn advocated by the Fidesz. At the same  time, the Fidesz defined itself as a nationally committed  liberal center party -- as such, it should have found support  with the broadest groups of society.    [Orban] Unfortunately, this did not happen. The country's  general mood was much more radical that the Fidesz's program.  Since we decided not to join this radicalism, our politics had  to go against the main drift. This was only enough to get the  number of votes we did on 8 May.    [Bednarik] Why did more people support the Free Democrats  when the liberal parties had put up very similar programs and  they had even coordinated these?    [Orban] I cannot yet give an exact answer to this. Perhaps  the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] advocated a much more  radical change than we did. If, at a discussion, I said  half-turn, [SZDSZ prime ministerial candidate] Gabor Kuncze  always emphasized the need for a full turn. When I spoke about  the danger of restoration of people in their positions, the  SZDSZ said that this did not have much chance. The Fidesz  distanced itself from the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] much  more than the SZDSZ did. Therefore, the differences between the  two liberal parties must have been quite clear for the voters.    [Bednarik] Is it possible to maintain the cooperation  agreement with the SZDSZ in spite of the fact that this will  further damage the Fidesz's final chances?    [Orban] When a party makes an agreement it should adhere to  it. Up to now, the Fidesz has adhered to all of its agreements  and it does not wish to change this practice.    [Bednarik] How was the Fidesz's failure affected by the fact  that, as Fidesz chairman, you conducted a very powerful campaign  against the MSZP?    [Orban] This is what is called sailing against the wind. I  think that our strong criticism of the MSZP did not have an  effect on the Fidesz's election results.    [Bednarik] Then what did?    [Orban] With hindsight, I believe that we did not  participate in criticizing the government as powerfully as the  MSZP or the SZDSZ. Therefore, the relationship between the  Socialists and the Young Democrats did not influence the voters.    [Bednarik] What is the hidden message of the first round of  the elections?    [Orban] It is perfectly clear that one of the most important  periods of Hungarian transition has ended. From now on, Hungary  has a new period in time because it has come to light that  people's political taste is different from that of four years  ago. It is the Fidesz's job to assess the situation and to  create a new strategy based on this, to prepare for analyzing  the government program, and to prepare for the local government  elections in a few months' time.    [Bednarik] Will the failure have any personal consequences?    [Orban] The mandate of the party leadership is for two  years, until 1995. Therefore, in theory, it is not possible to  replace people in the party. However, the chairman and all  deputy chairmen believe that the elections are an important  enough event for the Fidesz also to reconsider its personnel  decisions. We are not intending to resign but we will return  our mandates if the congress that is soon to be convened wishes  to elect new leaders. In this case, we will also overcome the  obstacles in our statute which would prevent the changes.    [Bednarik] What happens if the membership decides in favor  of change?    [Orban] In that case, I hope that they will find the people  who can better adjust to the new situation than we can.    [Bednarik] In view of the election results after the first  round, Zoltan Gal, the MSZP's parliamentary group leader, did  not exclude the possibility of cooperating with the Fidesz if  the attitude of the Young Democrats changed.    [Orban] I remember my late class teacher Geza Rimmel saying  similar things. I never took him seriously, either.    [Bednarik] Does this mean that there is still no chance of  the Fidesz entering into a coalition with the MSZP?    [Orban) We have not received such a request from the MSZP.  I maintain that while I am the Fidesz's chairman, it is not  possible to cooperate with this MSZP.</p>

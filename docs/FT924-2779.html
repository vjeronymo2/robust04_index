			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / Survey of Software at Work - Winter 1992 (21): Afloat in a rough sea - Leasing application / How on-line data helps reach balanced underwriting decisions WITH SO MANY companies going out of business or falling down on repayments, it is not easy for a leasing company to choose the right customers, writes David Tebbutt. Schroder Leasing, which leases office and medical equipment, owes its continued good health at least in part to its astute use of on line database information. 'Not only does the information enable us to reach balanced underwriting decisions, it has helped us to give our supplier network a more rapid response to proposals,' says James McWattie, general manager. These benefits have helped Schroder Leasing to maintain acceptable profitability through one of the worst crises in the sales aid leasing business. Mr McWattie uses financial, status and overview reports from ICC, depending on the level of information needed. Financial reports include balance sheet, and profit and loss. Status reports give details of smaller companies, which do not have to file full accounts. The financial or status report is accessed for deals in excess of Pounds 10,000, while the overview report is generally sufficient for smaller deals. Another key source of information is the county court judgment database which has recently been added to the ICC service. This often gives an indication that something is going wrong in a company. Once all the information is in, it is combined with other details such as the type of business, how long it has been trading and the industry it is in. Decisions can be made rapidly, providing the source information is comprehensive and up to date. BEFORE subscribing to the ICC service, Schroder Leasing relied on bank reports, county court judgments and lower level reports from other information providers and, sometimes, hard copy accounts which took up to 48 hours to arrive. The most-used report was Infolink's CMS4 which lists financial transactions on a company's file. This information is supplied by contributing members, such as finance houses and leasing companies. These methods were slow and inaccurate. If Schroder Leasing wanted to go into more detail on a company's circumstances, the delay could have meant the competition getting the deal. The recession has made it even more important to gain up-to-date information, and was another factor in looking for a more effective way of working. ICC's on-line database information was the first step. The system currently contains details on every single limited company, with full details on more than 360,000. These company records cover some 70 per cent of Schroder Leasing's business. It does, however, lack detail on sole traders and partnerships, the remaining 30 per cent. For this type of client, the company relies on UAPT Infolink and bank opinions. Schroder Leasing chose ICC because it offers first class data at a competitive price. Other on-line services and CD-ROMs considered were rejected for being inaccurate, out of date or for containing details of too few companies. In addition to filtering out bad risks, the on-line services have allowed Schroder Leasing to take on new business in risky sectors, by providing a clear view of a potential client's financial performance.

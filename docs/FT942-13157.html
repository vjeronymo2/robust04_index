			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / World Stock Markets: South Africa Shares recovered late in the day from pre-election nervousness as buyers returned, in spite of the spate of bomb blasts which have killed at least 19 people since Sunday.

The overall index finished 28 higher at 5,068 and industrials were 43 ahead at 6,031. De Beers reversed losses to post a 75 cent gain to R108.25 and Anglos made R1.50 to R215.50.

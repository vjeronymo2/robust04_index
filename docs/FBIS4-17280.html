			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Russian Justice Minister Yuriy Kalmykov by </F> Leonid Nikitinskiy; date and place not given: "What Is Stopping  State Duma From Passing Laws. Our Correspondent Leonid  Nikitinskiy Talks With Justice Minister and State Duma Deputy  Yuriy Kalmykov"]    [Text] [Nikitinskiy] Which of your two hats would you  prefer to wear as we begin -- minister or deputy?    [Kalmykov] I would like to divorce the two roles. Although  as justice minister I can probably see the problems in  legislation more clearly than most of my Duma colleagues. Our  rule-of-law area is reminiscent of the diminishing ozone layer  over the earth -- and saving it and launching a mechanism for  reviving it will take emergency measures.    [Nikitinskiy] The Duma has been at work for four months, and  not a single law in the proper sense of the word has been passed  in that time....    [Kalmykov] To a certain extent this hiatus is normal since  it is due to the discussion of the standing orders and other  documents regulating the work of the Duma itself. At the same  time, each plenary session in the Duma begins with a heated  debate on the agenda which has already been approved the  previous day by the Duma Council. Feelings run high, and, as a  result, we are not in a position to tackle actual legislative  matters. I put this down mainly to a lack of experience.    [Nikitinskiy] Experience is something you have to earn. But  the first and, so far, last legislative attempt to "pass" the  law on the Constitutional Court by a two-thirds vote failed for  purely political reasons. For certain factions and groups in  the Duma torpedoing the Constitution is a very important element  of their strategy of preparing for the next elections.    [Kalmykov] Nonetheless the majority of people in the Duma,  as I see it, are sensible enough to stay within the  constitutional framework. This was stated by Speaker Ivan  Rybkin as a representative of the majority of deputies. For its  part the government and the president have enough carefully  prepared draft laws in reserve that they can and should  "bombard" the Duma -- but the correct utilization of these  drafts is being impeded by the fact that the procedure for their  submission has not been regulated in detail and there are no set  precedents.    [Nikitinskiy] Do you mean that there is political rivalry  even in the sphere of legislative initiative?    [Kalmykov] I probably have to agree. I believe that, for  instance, the president should initiate only the most important  draft constitutional laws and major codified acts. The  legislative initiative of factions and deputies' groups should  in the course of time become more the exception, with the bulk  of draft laws -- as is the case worldwide -- being submitted by  the government.    [Nikitinskiy] As long as draft laws are being used for  political advertising they will merely distract lawmakers into  rehashing their deliberately unpalatable product. Yet there are  many filters in different branches of power designed to prevent  any "foreign bodies" from getting into the legislative  apparatus....    [Kalmykov] These mechanisms often do not so much help each  other by sticking to a unified strategy as produce conflicts,  which creates chaos in lawmaking and a loophole for lobbyists.  Answering on behalf of the Justice Ministry, I can say that,  owing to apparatus intrigues, it is often bypassed and prevented  from carrying out its direct duties. Our functions are  expanding on paper, but other structures -- primarily the State  Legal Administration -- are constantly infringing them.    From the very beginning, by dint of its role, this has been  one of the departments at the Presidential Administration  responsible for the legal side both of its own edicts and of  legislative initiatives. Initially, it also included  departments dealing with awards, appeals, and citizenship.  These were then hived off into independent Presidential  Administration structures, but the State Legal Administration  was not only not cut back, it grew to an absurd size. This  structure now has a staff as big as a sector ministry, but it  has arrogated intersector functions to itself. You get the  impression that the State Legal Administration is not controlled  either by the Presidential Administration or by the president  himself -- not to mention the government, with which it is in  constant conflict instead of organizing working contacts.    [Nikitinskiy] There are some very qualified legal  specialists working at the State Legal Administration.  According to lawyers, a comparison of their expertise with that  of the Justice Ministry leaves the latter coming off worse.    [Kalmykov] The level of provision and benefits in that  mysterious structure is an order of magnitude higher than we  have. But many of them are not at all doing the job that should  follow from the modest functions of the president's apparatus.  When it comes to the legislative process the State Legal  Administration constantly obtructs the government and even the  president and torpedoes many draft laws merely because they  carry an "outside stamp." We can now expect friction between  the State Legal Administration and Aleksandr Yakovlev, the  president's representative in parliament.    We recently received from the State Legal Administration a  draft of the Labor Code with a proposal that we study it and  make our comments. But how did it get there, bypassing the  Justice Ministry and the government? At the same time, the  draft Civil Code, on which long and painstaking work has been  done by specialists at the behest of the president and the  government -- and that was no secret to the State Legal  Administration -- has gotten bogged down there "for  coordination" and has not made any progress for months. This  after having been approved by the government and receiving a  promise from the president to support the legislative  initiative. I suspect that the real reason for this delay lies  once again not in the sphere of the law, but in the sphere of  official ambition. In order to spite the specialists drawing up  the draft Civil Code, another group of lawyers is now urgently  working on the Trade Code. The draft of this code, which rivals  the Civil Code, has to all intents and purposes been kept  secret, and we can so far only speculate as to what it will look  like. We only know that the working group is headed by  Academician Vladimir Laptev, formerly a vigorous opponent of the  development of trade and monetary relations in the country and  an advocate of administrative regulation of the economy within  the framework of the concept of so-called "economic law."    [Nikitinskiy] If the law-drafting process is such a mystery  even to you, the justice minister, imagine yourself once again  in an ordinary deputy's position. How can he sort all this out,  what should he think?    [Kalmykov] That this is a mad house, of course....</p>

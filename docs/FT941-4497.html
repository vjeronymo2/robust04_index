			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / Air France puts Pounds 2.3bn rescue proposal to unions Air France yesterday put a rescue plan, including a three-year wage freeze and 5,000 voluntary redundancies, to its 14 trade unions. The French government has made union acceptance a condition for injecting FFr20bn (Pounds 2.3bn) into the ailing state airline. An official of Force Ouvriere, the largest union at Air France, said it would 'not put a spanner' in the management's plan. Two other big unions complained the government was 'blackmailing' them into accepting the scheme. Mr Christian Blanc, the new Air France president, insisted that all 14 unions must approve the rescue to prevent any recurrence of the damaging strike that led to the scrapping of a previous austerity plan last October and the resignation of Mr Blanc's predecessor, Mr Bernard Attali. Unlike the Attali plan, the new measures do not include forced redundancies or pay cuts. Air France's request for 'at least FFr20bn' in state aid to help cover its losses, which amounted to FFr7.5bn last year, and to help service its FFr37bn debt, requires approval from the European Commission. Confident of approval, Mr Blanc said the Commission should be reassured that the state aid would not distort competition in the European market, as Air France would be reducing its fleet from 166 to 149 aircraft during five years. It plans to increase by 2 per cent a year the seats per kilometre it could offer, by better use of its carriers. This would also be the last time Air France would seek state aid, he promised. Decisions on airline aid are made by Mr Abel Matutes, the transport commissioner. His officials said yesterday that the French aid request was in proportion to aid recently promised by Portugal and Greece to their carriers. The UK, where British Airways has made clear its opposition to any subvention for the French carrier, is expected to lobby against the state aid. Praising BA's turnround in recent years, Mr Blanc said the UK carrier should give Air France the chance to do the same. He criticised BA for its 'lack of fair play' in wooing passengers away from the French airline and 'its clear desire to see Air France disappear'. Mr Blanc threatens unions that if Air France does not adapt to the new rules of international air competition, it may go under. 'We must live with these rules or disappear,' he said. Mr Blanc, addressing journalists at one of the Meridien hotels which Air France owns, said he would sell the hotel chain 'before the summer'. Accor of France and Forte of the UK are rival bidders. Mr Blanc also revealed Air France's intention to disentangle itself from its Dollars 30m investment in CSA, the Czech airline. In addition to selling some aircraft, Mr Blanc said Air France planned to cut its level of non-fuel purchases by 16 per cent during three years, starting with a saving of FFr650m this year.

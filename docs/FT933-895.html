			<p>930927 FT  27 SEP 93 / Sinn Fein enters peace process: Tim Coone glimpses the prospect of political progress in Ulster as bilateral talks raise hopes THE twists and turns of Northern Ireland's politics are rarely clear and the finer details tend to escape those who live outside the province. But a significant event occurred this weekend which will resonate well beyond the parochial confines of the Belfast or Londonderry City Halls or the corridors of the Northern Ireland Office at Stormont. For Sinn Fein, the political wing of the Provisional IRA - which has been waging a terrorist campaign to effect the withdrawal of Britain from the province - has now formally entered a process of negotiation to put an end to the violence. On Saturday evening Mr John Hume, the leader of the Social Democratic Labour party, and Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein leader, jointly announced that they are submitting a report to the Irish government on the progress of their bilateral talks which have been taking place during the past six months. It is intended that the report will be discussed in Dublin and in London. Mr John Major, the British prime minister, was apparently told two weeks ago that such a development was imminent when he met Mr Hume in Downing Street on September 16. Since starting his bilateral talks with Mr Adams, Mr Hume has emphasised that they are not aimed at achieving a simple ceasefire but are aimed at bringing about 'a total cessation of all violence'. Politics in Northern Ireland entered a vacuum in November last year when a series of round-table talks between the main political parties, initiated in 1991 by Mr Peter Brooke, the former Northern Ireland Secretary, broke up without an agreement. Those talks were overseen by the British and Irish governments under the auspices of the 1985 Anglo-Irish agreement, and were designed to produce a replacement for the 1985 agreement and a new constitutional framework for the province. Unionist insistence that the Irish Republic must first drop its territorial claim to Northern Ireland as a basis for continued negotiation was a significant obstacle to progress. Sinn Fein was excluded from the talks because of its tacit support for the IRA, and both governments have refused to negotiate with the party until such time as either Sinn Fein renounces the IRA, or the IRA itself decides to end its military campaign. Frustrated with the failure of the round-table talks, Mr Hume then decided to take a totally different tack. Although the target of much invective and attacks from the Unionists for embarking upon his negotiation with Mr Adams, it is significant that neither the Irish nor British governments have criticised him for doing so. It is still too early to say that a breakthrough has been achieved in the Northern Ireland logjam. as Immensely delicate and careful negotiations remain to be carried out, not least to convince the Unionist parties that there might be some merit in the SDLP-Sinn Fein proposals. But it is highly significant that Mr Hume is today in the US briefing US Congressional leaders about his proposals. As an SDLP spokesman said in Belfast: 'It is not likely that either the British or Irish governments will talk to Sinn Fein yet, until there is an end to the violence. But that does not mean they will not talk through an intermediary.'</p>

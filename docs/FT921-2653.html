			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / Election '92: Labour gambles with the affluent - The implications for marginal seats of John Smith's tax plans IT IS the biggest gamble of the campaign. As the details of Mr John Smith's shadow Budget settled into the country's electoral landscape yesterday the political judgment emerged from the complicated arithmetic of his proposed tax and benefit changes. In the battle for the marginal seats on which a Labour victory depends, the shadow chancellor has decided to sacrifice the potential support of the affluent in a drive to reassure the skilled working classes. If last night's polls prove a reliable guide it will work. The survey taken after Mr Smith's announcement pointed to a five-point Labour lead  - the same result as a poll taken before plans were unveiled. But the Conservatives, who have three weeks to 'unpick' the plans, claimed the package was a bad miscalculation: that Labour had alienated too many of the modestly well-off. Their judgment was that the plan to abolish the Pounds 21,000 ceiling on National Insurance contributions would swing back to the government many of the 30 or so seats in London and the south-east which have been targeted by the opposition. The Labour leadership was equally adamant that it had kept the balance of advantage. As Mr Smith put it, Labour is not chasing votes in the stockbroker belt. It is the support of a much larger segment of the electorate, the average taxpayer and average family, which it is after. Mr Smith won independent backing for his claim that across the country eight out of 10 taxpayers would be better off under his package and that of those remaining only 10 per cent would be losers. But it is not as simple as that. The distribution and present political allegiance of those voters may turn out to be just as important as the numbers. In London, where Labour is hoping to win at least 20 seats, the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies calculated that the number of losers rose to 18 per cent. In the south-east, where Labour may win another 10 seats, the proportion worse off from the package was put at 14 per cent. The Conservatives - who do not accept that the IFS has included all of the 'hidden' tax increases in the calculations - said that in constituencies where the outcome depended on a few thousand votes or less the losers would give them a decisive advantage. Mr John Major reeled off a list of those who would have to pay the extra 9 per cent in every pound earned over Pounds 21,000 a year. They were not just the rich: a primary school head teacher would pay an extra Pounds 560 a year, a secondary school head Pounds 1,500, a senior hospital registrar Pounds 517 and a GP Pounds 1,700. To that list his strategists attached the names of marginal constituencies such as Slough and Basildon, Dulwich and Battersea, Hampstead and Croydon North West. The message to those seats is that Labour does not plan an extra tax on the rich but on those whose incomes are not far above the male average of Pounds 18,000 a year. One member of the cabinet said that Mr Smith, for all his presentational skills, had forgotten the golden rule of politics. Gainers from tax changes were rarely thankful but the losers always screamed. He has also failed to appreciate that 'people do not think statistically'. Many of those who earn less than Pounds 20,000 aspire to incomes above it. There are other constituencies where concentrations of relatively affluent voters might tilt the balance. Elmet in North Yorkshire, Birmingham Hall Green, Southampton Test and Chester fall into that category. Mr Smith recognised the risks but judged that it was one he had to take. The careful package of increases in tax thresholds, the abolition of the starting rate of NICs and the increases in child benefit and pensions had a single objective: to persuade those earning between perhaps Pounds 10,000 and Pounds 20,000 a year that they have nothing to fear from Labour. For Labour they are the swing voters whose crosses on the ballot paper will decide the election. The party's research showed that the Conservatives had been successful in persuading many of them, particularly in marginals, that they faced substantial tax increases. Labour had to reassure them. Mr Smith's assessment was that winning back their support was more important than appealing to a smaller segment of the electorate which leans heavily towards the Conservatives. The shadow chancellor, of course, would not admit such cynical motives. As an aide said: 'This was an occasion when we could be morally correct and politically wise.'

The minister said he had met with Russian President Boris  Yeltsin and Prime minister Viktor Chernomyrdin before leaving on  the visits and called these meetings "rich in content." Kozyrev  said the prime minister was "determined to maintain financial  discipline, even restrict it, and limit spending and loans."    Kozyrev said Chernomyrdin intended to attend to the European  Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, to explain Russia's  economic policy there. "We are planning considerable steps to  streamline the economic reforms," he pointed out.    The foreign minister said he believed it a big mistake of  Moscow's western partners and friends to wait for the failure of  reforms in Russia. "It is necessary to make real business and  help the Russian reforms instead of waiting for the scenario of  the end of the world to come," he said.    In an answer to an Interfax question, Kozyrev said his  political views had seen no changes.    "Kozyrev is still the same," the minister said. "He still  supports good-neighborly relations with the Baltic states and an  organized withdrawal of (Russian - IF note) troops on the basis  of agreements rather than cries about occupants, etc., what I  call political hysteria. But he still supports observing human  rights." At the same time, Kozyrev regretted that the Baltic  states "were going further along the way of violating human  rights." Among such violations, the minister indicated the  "attempt to deport dozens of thousands people" from Latvia and  "possibly Estonia."</p>

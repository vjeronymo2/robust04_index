			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 29 (YONHAP) -- Song Yong-tae, vice  minister of the National Unification Board, reaffirmed Friday  that the government will go ahead with its policy of seeking  early repatriation of North Korean loggers in Russia.    Speaking to business leaders at a breakfast meeting held  under the auspices of the Korea Management Association at the  Hyatt Hotel, Song also said various government agencies were  devising measures to help the loggers settle in South Korea.    While delivering a speech entitled "The Outlook for the  North  Korean Nuclear Problem and the Seoul-Pyongyang Relationship,"  Song revealed that Pyongyang has stopped issuing travel  certificates to North Koreans and strictly limited entry by  foreigners since mid-March in an apparent effort to heighten  internal tension.    Pyongyang recently increased military activity 50 percent  and  resumed anti-air raid drills in the Yongbyon area, which Western  countries suspect has facilities capable of producing nuclear  weapons, Song said. North Korea had suspended the drills in the  Yongbyon area last June.</p>

			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / Arts: A motley cast for 'Aida' - Opera There was a motley crew for Verdi's Aida on Wednesday, motlier than I can remember seeing at the Royal Opera - and that was just the audience, who ran from American neglige (greying T-shirts, busted chinos) to bold chic imported from deeply foreign countries. It was a nice touch for the RO to have imported another motley new cast, unable to communicate with one another nor even, apparently, with the conductor Edward Downes. I have to report that by the end, most of the audience were vociferously delighted. 'New cast' is too simple, because the singers successively contracted for this Aida - Elijah Moshinsky's new production - have been dropping like flies. Somebody at the RO has had to spend desperate hours on international phone-lines. Wednesday's Radames, the Icelander Kristjan Johannsson (new to London), was flown in on the afternoon of the performance: it was no wonder that he and his Aida seemed never to have been properly introduced. Of the ex-Soviet singers - not including the Amonasro of Gregory Yurisich, who is Australian - Nina Rautio's Aida sang in even less intelligible Italian than Paata Burchuladze's High Priest. Burchuladze, however, lent imposing power and presence to his faceless role; Miss Rautio, musically quite effective, kept herself glumly to herself, and her acting to raising one or both arms heavenward at high notes. It was amusing to watch Dolora Zajick's Amneris (a daunting Midwestern hostess), Yurisich's wild Amonasro and Johannsson's stiff, upstanding Radames trying in turn to get some dramatic response from her, all in vain. The Zajick mezzo has too sharp an edge for the crucial Act 2 scene with Aida  -which I have not seen more crudely played: where was Moshinsky?  - but came into its own with the Act 4 showdown. Johannsson's Italian-schooled tenor has bright metal and force (he must be a stirring Manrico in Trovatore), but not much grace. 'Celeste Aida' was brittle, and he kept rushing his fences - again and again Downes made considerate room for him to breathe in, but he refused to take it. Otherwise, Downes himself sounded un-tender with the score, though of course efficient: grand, noisy ensembles, but no magic in the quieter music. As usual Moshinsky has built a clean, thrifty production, designed to last; I thought that recycling Michael Yeargan's Nile act set, with its tall array of Anubis-heads, for the Act 4 trial looked too much like parsimony. And why Aida and her father should belong to a genetically deviant tribe of Ethiopians (none of them was remotely black) remained a mystery: could this be a perverse example of pc? In repertory with a variety of singers until July 22</p>

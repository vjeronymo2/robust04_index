			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / Japan 'over worst' of bad-debt crisis: Central bank governor hails progress in lifting bad loans burden The protracted bad-debt crisis experienced by Japan's banks appeared to be past its worst, Mr Yasushi Mieno, governor of the Bank of Japan, said yesterday. In a speech at the bank's Institute for Monetary and Economic Studies, Mr Mieno, who retires next month after five years as head of the central bank, said banks had made significant progress towards lifting the burden of bad debts produced by the collapse of property and other asset prices in the past few years. Mr Mieno has raised eyebrows in financial circles in the past six months with his insistently upbeat assessments of Japan's economic prospects. Yesterday that optimism was focused on the overall health of the banking system, though he criticised banks for their slowness in facing up to their bad debts. 'We may no longer have to be concerned about how much further the problem of non-performing assets is going to develop since the outline of the problem has now become fairly clear,' Mr Mieno said. The bad-debt burden has made Japanese banks wary of new lending, in particular, in the international market. Mr Mieno was careful to avoid claiming that the total number of bad loans had peaked, stating only that the 'pace of increase in non-performing loans' seems to have slowed. Figures published in the banks' annual reports in May supported the proposition that the total had peaked. Disclosed bad loans at the nation's 21 largest commercial banks fell by 1.3 per cent between September 1993 and March this year to Y13,600bn (Pounds 85.85bn). But these figures include only loans to bankrupt companies and loans in arrears by six months or more. In Japan, unlike most other countries, banks are not obliged to give figures for loans where interest rates have been cut to keep a borrower afloat, nor those on which no interest has been paid for up to six months. Most analysts estimate that adding in these loans would almost double the bad loan book, and would suggest that the total is still rising. Mr Mieno said the banks' reluctance to acknowledge and write off non-performing loans had delayed improvements in balance sheets. He added that the delay may have had a negative effect on the macroeconomy. The governor said it was necessary to strengthen Japan's financial system by promoting faster deregulation, and by encouraging banks to be more innovative and to discard their natural tendency not to step out of line with each other.

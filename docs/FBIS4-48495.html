			<p>BFN     [Text] The political crisis in Lesotho has deepened after a  meeting of leaders failed to end the police and prison guards'  strike. Reports say the main opposition party walked out of the  emergency talks after being accused by Prime Minister Ntsu  Mokhehle of complicity in the strike. About 2,500 policemen  below the rank of captain in the country's 3,000-strong police  force started striking last week demanding a 60 percent pay  increase. They were joined by junior prison guards.</p>

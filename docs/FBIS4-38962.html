			<p>BFN     [Text] Simferopol -- On 2 June, Max van der Stoel, the CSCE  high commissioner for minorities, who has visited Ukraine three  times over the past six months, met Mustafa Dzhemilev, head of  the Majlis of the Crimean Tatar people. During a discussion on  the status of the Crimean Tatars in Crimea, the possibility of  extending aid to the Crimean Tatars along CSCE lines was  discussed. It was decided to render such aid to Ukraine as a  whole, however, within the framework of a program targeted at  Crimean Tatars.    Max van der Stoel had his second meeting with Crimean Deputy  Prime Minister Yevgeniy Saburov. Summing up the results at the  request of a UNIAN correspondent, Saburov pointed out that the  talks were, first and foremost, about the status of Russians in  Crimea, because Russians are a national minority in Ukraine.  According to Saburov, he "told Max van der Stoel about the  pressure exerted by the leadership of Ukraine."    Saburov also commented on the outcome of the sitting of the  International Trade Club, which took place last week in Crimea.  He reported that the trade representatives of the embassies  sent a letter of thanks for the warm reception, and declared  that the representatives of business circles who arrived in  Crimea got the impression that the conflict there is not a  result of some ethnic processes but just as a result of a  conflict between political elites. Saburov underlined: "I am  glad that the representatives of the embassies left Crimea as  our supporters."    On the same day, Max van der Stoel met Serhiy Tsekov,  chairman of the Supreme Council of Crimea and Leonid Hrach,  first secretary of the Communist Party of Crimea.    On 3 June, the CSCE High Commissioner Max van der Stoel is  expected to arrive in Kiev where he will meet the Ukrainian  president.</p>

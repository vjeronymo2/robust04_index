			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / Waigel rejects advice from Paris on monetary policy MR Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, effectively told his French counterpart, Mr Edmond Alphandery, yesterday to mind his own business: the Bonn government did not need outside advice, and German monetary policy was a matter for the Bundesbank alone. He was responding to a broadcast in which Mr Alphandery claimed he had called a meeting in Paris for yesterday to discuss concerted action on interest rates. Mr Alphandery said the Bundesbank should move faster to relax its 'unduly restrictive' monetary policy. Mr Alphandery said: 'We are going to speak equal to equal . . . That was not the case a few months ago . . . Today the franc can support itself, perhaps better than the D-Mark.' Mr Waigel, blaming pressure of work, instantly cancelled what his officials called a 'routine' quarterly meeting of the Franco-German economic and finance council. Yesterday he aired his riposte in a radio interview. Mr Waigel said the Germans knew exactly what was required and what was possible. The view from Frankfurt and Bonn is that the fledgling French minister's statements on Thursday were clumsy and undiplomatic. There would 'certainly' be no collaborative reductions in interest rates, he said. The government was doing 'precisely what is necessary to provide the Bundesbank with room to manoeuvre' in preparing cuts to reduce public-spending deficits, which the Bundesbank considers essential before it can consider further interest rate reductions. It was certainly desirable that that interest rate cuts should be possible in a period of recession, Mr Waigel said. He said German long-term rates were at their lowest for three years. He and Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, who was also due to attend the cancelled meeting, had repeatedly emphasised how important it was for other countries to make the most of any latitude. France now has official short-term rates below those in Germany for the first time since the late 1960s. Currencies, Page 13</p>

			<p><P> July 28, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHARGES OF RACISM IN FILM INDUSTRY  </P> <P> Black people are collectively fed up and feel that it is time for negative  portrayals of blacks in films and on television to cease. Black people of  conscience throughout the nation applaud Clegg for having the wisdom to  recognize the seriousness of this issue, for having the courage to speak out  against it, and for having the decency and sense of reason to request a forum  to discuss a resolution of same.  </P> <P> Clegg's request for a summit between blacks and Jewish producers does not  constitute prejudice; but rather, it demonstrates the actions of a reasonable  man who is seeking racial harmony in an effort to restore the dignity of his  people.  </P> <P> ROSE KNOTT  </P> <P> Bellflower  </P></p>

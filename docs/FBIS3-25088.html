			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by President Lansana Conte with foreign and </F> local correspondents in Conakry on 1 February, moderated by  unidentified official--recorded]    [Excerpts] [Correspondent Isaac Maiga] I am Isaac Maiga of  the Mali radio and television service. There is increasing talk  of insecurity in the capital city, Conakry. What steps are you  taking to put an end to this increase in banditry? My second  question, Mr. President, is this: You have just been elected  for a new five-year term. What are your priorities in the  implementation of your manifesto? And my last question, Mr.  President, what will the role of the Army be in the new Guinean  democracy? Thank you.    [Conte] It is true that in our country today there is a lot  of insecurity. Measures have been taken by the Ministry of  Interior and Security to deal with this plague. You might have  heard on the radio the measures that the Ministry of Interior  has just taken to curb the activities of the bandits who  represent a scourge in our cities. I think it is a long-term  project. Insecurity in our country is so developed that it  cannot be eliminated in one day but we have, in fact, made it a  priority among our priorities in order to curb it. Even if it  cannot be eliminated completely, we aim at least to drastically  reduce the insecurity prevailing in our country, especially in  the city of Conakry.    Now if you want to know the details of these measures, you  can contact the Ministry of Interior, but I believe we do not  even have to tell you the type of measures being taken because  we should not warn these bandits of all the measures we are  taking against them otherwise, as you know, they will take the  appropriate countermeasures. So there are certain things we are  keeping secret.    Now, concerning my priorities during my five-year term, they  will first include the security we have been talking about,  national unity, and the need for Guineans to work hard. They  will also include the economic development of our country. We  will use all the means at our disposal for our country's  development beginning with the basis for development,  agriculture.    In regard to the Army's role, it will maintain its  traditional role. Under the First Republic, the Army was  authorized to be involved in the political life of the country.  The Army as we know has its own role that all soldiers know.  It is this role that we are going to revive, that is, defending  the territorial integrity of the country, therefore, defending  our country. This is the task to which the Army will devote  itself. The Army will not only defend our country but we should  ensure that we are present anywhere we are needed in the West  African subregion. We should be present anywhere in Africa,  wherever we are needed, to defend the cause of peace. So our  role is quite clear. We shall leave politicians to fight on the  political field, and we shall fight in the military field. I  believe if we carry out our work correctly in the Army, it will  enable politicians to also carry out their work correctly.  [passage omitted]    [Maiga] Mr. President, does this mean therefore that the  Army  will henceforth return to the barracks?    [Conte] But the Army has always been in the barracks!    [Maiga] I mean, Mr. President....    [Conte, interrupting] Even in the First Republic the Army  was  always in the barracks; only a few soldiers were given civilian  functions. Even in very developed countries, there are generals  and colonels who assume civilian responsibilities. That does  not mean that the Army is not in the barracks. You are always  talking of barracks, barracks...do you think they are prisons?  [laughter] The barracks are not prisons. They are places where  soldiers live; but they are not obliged to shut up. They are  free citizens like anyone else. [passage omitted]    [Pamissan] My name is Edouard Pamissan of the LE BUCHERON  newspaper in Gabon. Mr. President, I would first like to  highlight an exceptional event which is the one we are  witnessing, that of a head of state holding a news conference  with opposition reporters. I believe this does not happen often  and needs to be highlighted. In your introductory speech, you  dwelled at length on the media. You spoke on the role of  journalists. This means you have confidence in the role of the  media in a democratic regime. I would like to highlight a few  points.    One of our colleagues of the national radio was molested by  a  soldier for participating in a march organized by the  opposition. The other point is that when one listens to the  national radio and television, one realizes that there is very  little participation by the opposition. Talking about  pluralism, which is one of the basic tenets of democracy, you  said you would gradually set in motion an already existing  mechanism. My question is this: Would it not be better to  rather start with pluralism, which is the very basis for  democracy and which allows for the expression of various ideas?  Would it not be better to start the democratic process by the  liberation of the media and the development of free expression,  which are the basic tenets of democracy? Thank you.    [Conte] How should start the democratic process? By  pluralism?    [Pamissan] Yes, I mean when one talks of democracy, one  speaks of pluralism. Is pluralism not the very basis for  democracy and freedom of expression? Would it not have been  better to start from there?    [Conte] The essential thing is to attain one's objective.  Whether one starts with pluralism or with freedom of expression,  the essential thing is that we attain the objective we have  assigned ourselves. We want freedom for everybody, especially  the media. The media have been writing, the media have been  talking. We do not see any inconvenience in what the media  writes or talks about. We want our country to be genuinely  democratic so that everyone can express himself freely. You  have just said a soldier beat up a reporter because he was with  the opposition. Did you ask the soldier and the reporter why  they were fighting?    [Pamissan] No, Mr. President.    [Conte] Why do you judge people without listening to them? I  am sure the reporter said something to the soldier that did not  please him but he did not beat him up because of politics.  [passage omitted]    [Unidentified moderator] Thank you Mr. President. Now,  (Pierre Florent) of the Voice of America.    [(Florent)] [passage omitted] Are you going to invite the  opposition to form a government of national unity?    [Conte] I have told you that I am not going to invite  anybody. I am not going to call on anybody. Do not expect  Africans to do what you do not do in your country. In your  country when the president is elected he choses the men he  likes. Leave us to choose the men we want to choose. Do not  try to impose on us the people you want to see in government.  [passage omitted]    [Moderator] A question of economic interest from the foreign  media by the Africa No. 1 correspondent.    [Unidentified correspondent] Mr. President, I wonder whether  the fact that Guinea does not belong to the franc zone today is  a good policy or a bad one. That is my first question. My  second question, Mr. President, is this: You have decided to  personally ensure probity in the management of public property.  Last year there was a scandal at the Ministry of Finance. Do  you personally intend to follow up on the outcome of this  scandal?    [Conte] You are referring to the CFA franc. You are asking  whether it is good or bad to be outside the franc zone. I think  you should ask the ordinary Guinean in the street what he thinks  of it. I personally do not find any (?inconvenience) in being  outside the zone. If the people ask us [words indistinct].    Concerning probity in the management of public property, I  believe we are going to continue to ensure that but I believe it  is not management itself that needs moral probity. It is the  people in charge of management who need it. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / Money Markets: Focus on sterling WITH money market dealers awaiting the results of tomorrow's Bundesbank council meeting, the focus in interest rate markets turned to sterling and hopes of another cut in UK base rates before the end of the year, writes James Blitz. On Monday, there had been a little more speculation of a cut in UK base rates as the pound came close to touching DM2.60 against the D-Mark. Yesterday the currency suffered a sharp setback, but interest rate cut hopes were kept alive by the slightly gloomy economic forecast from the Confederation of British Industry. In its quarterly survey of industrial trends, the CBI said there had been a weakening of the UK's export markets in Europe, which might weaken the recovery. This led to new speculation that Mr Kenneth Clarke, the UK chancellor, might reduce British base rates in his winter budget. The monthly monetary report from the Treasury also confirmed that inflation was far from imposing any danger to the UK economy. The main response to this news came in the futures market, where the December short sterling contract rose 2 basis points, but later fell back to close at 94.40, up one basis point on the day. The September contract finished 2 basis points ahead at 94.17. Although three-month money in the sterling cash market was unchanged at 6 per cent, there was a sloping of the yield curve further out. The one-year rate ended  1/16 percentage point down on the day at 5 7/8 per cent. There was a tiny shortage of Pounds 200m. In Europe, all eyes remained firmly fixed on tomorrow's Bundesbank council meeting, with few new clues on how the council will vote. The Bundesbank announced that it would be holding a variable rate repo for 14 days at variable bid rates. One-day T-Bills continued to be sold at 7.0 per cent. This underlined expectations that the repo rate might come down 15 basis points to 7 per cent. Both the September and December Euromark contracts were unaltered at 93.39 and 93.98. French markets were also quiet. The September and December French franc contracts were unchanged as the franc remained stable in the European exchange rate mechanism. Although French three-month money hovered around 9 per cent, the spread between the bid and offer rates narrowed to 50 basis points.</p>

			<p><P> September 26, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: IRVINE;  </P> <P> 200 LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS ATTEND SEMINAR  </P> <P> About 200 California law enforcement officials converged in Irvine on Monday  for a statewide seminar on extradition.  </P> <P> During the two-day seminar, sheriff's deputies, correction officers and  assistant district attorneys will learn about handling extradition requests and  orders from interstate and international agencies.  </P> <P> "There is a growing tendency now for wanted persons to flee the jurisdictions  of courts," said Al Howenstein Jr., executive director of the governor's office  of criminal justice planning, the seminar's sponsor. "We want our officials to  be keen on all the complexities involved in the process."  </P> <P> Last year, this state was engaged in extradition proceedings involving about  1,600 wanted suspects and prisoners, according to statistics from the  governor's office.  </P> <P> Sen. Pete Wilson (R.-Calif), who was scheduled to deliver the keynote address  on Colombian drug trafficking, canceled his visit because of a commitment in  Washington, seminar organizers said. He was replaced by Sacramento Superior  Court Judge Vance Raye.  </P> <P> Raye, who previously served as Gov. George Deukmejian's legal affairs  secretary, said: "We decided early on in the administration that we would abide  by the letter and spirit of the extradition act, and California would not  become a refuge for those who thought themselves unjustly accused in other  states."  </P></p>

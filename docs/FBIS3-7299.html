Two recent tightenings by the Federal Reserve Board have  pushed up short-term rates while worries of overheating boost  longer-term rates and make Wall Street skittish, the central  bank said in its monthly report on overseas economies.    Fears are emerging about whether the American economy will  grow at a sustainable pace around 3 percent or whether a recent  surge will reignite inflation, a BOJ economist told reporters.    In Europe, France is beginning to show clear progress in its  stock adjustments, while Britain remains in a gentle recovery  led by personal consumption, with employment conditions  improving and industrial production on the rise, the report  said. But growing German exports cannot overcome slumping  domestic demand to put the country clearly on the path of  recovery, despite production recovery in the former East  Germany, it said.    Gross domestic product in Western Germany fell in the fourth  quarter after two quarters of gains as worsening employment  weighed on consumption and delayed stock adjustments depressed  capital spending, the report said.    By contrast, it said that in China such investment in plant  and equipment continues to fuel strong growth despite  credit-tightening starting at the end of January to curb  inflation.    South Korea's economy is improving as exports rise, while  Southeast Asia continues to grow strongly with increasing  infrastructure spending and growing trade within the countries  of the region, according to the BOJ report.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Hanoi VNA Jan 13 -- Dialogue between nations on  common issues of the world has the effect of narrowing down  disagreement while promoting mutual understanding, said Deputy  Foreign Minister Le Mai on Thursday.    This trend is growing in present-day international  relations,  he said in an interview granted to VIETNAM NEWS AGENCY.    Le Mai said each nation has the responsibility of  guaranteeing human rights within its territorial boundaries. He  also acknowledged that human rights were the concern of the  world community as a whole.    He said Vietnam agreed to talk with other countries on human  rights because it wanted those countries to understand that the  people of Vietnam had given so much for man's sacred fundamental  rights on this land, and were making tremendous efforts in all  fields -- political, economic, cultural and social -- to ensure  human rights in their country.    "We will talk with other countries", Le Mai said, "so that a  correct understanding can be had on the fundamental principles  of an international law on human rights, namely respect for  national independence and national sovereignty, respect for the  right of nations to self-determination, particularly the right  for each to choose its own path of development, respect for  national, community of individual rights, respect for political,  civil, economic and social right of the citizen and respect for  the right of nations for development which is now a topical  problem of the world". [sentence as received]    Le Mai dismissed recent press reports about dialogue on  "certain aspects of human rights in Vietnam". "Vietnam and  other countries have agreed that their exchanges of views will  be conducted on the basis of equality, mutual respect and  non-interference", he stressed.    Le Mai said he believed the talks would be positive and  constructive. "If our interlocutors can say concretely where  and how our law does not conform strictly to international law  we will [words indistinct] seriously and refer them to  Vietnamese competent bodies for consideration".    "At the same time we will try to make other countries share  our views that man's most fundamental rights are national self-  determination and development, which must be strictly  respected," Le Mai added.    He said he hoped the world community, through dialogue,  would  gradually establish mutual respect and [words indistinct] and  equal, mutually beneficial cooperation on human rights.    "Human rights should not be used as a tool for one country  to  impose on, or interfere in, another country", Le Mai concluded.</p>

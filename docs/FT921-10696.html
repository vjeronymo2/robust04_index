			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / Observer: Wise men It's good to hear that Lord Shawcross - 90 yesterday - still regularly turns up for work at J P Morgan's London branch where he advises on international matters. He is one of a select group of wise old birds including Warburg's Henry Grunfeld (87) and Lord Roll (84), who do a daily stint at their city desks. Hermann Abs (90) also checks in occasionally at Deutsche Bank. Recent events at conglomerates like Hanson and Lonrho have highlighted understandable institutional concerns about who is going to succeed some of Britain's ageing captains of industry. Indeed, some big pension funds like Postel now have a policy of opposing the re-election of any director who is 70 or over. However, this seems far too mechanistic, especially since some of the world's best-run financial institutions feel the need to listen to their elder statesmen. Indeed, Observer hears that National Bank of Kuwait has a director - Khaled Al-Hamad - who is in his 110th year. . . .</p>

Detained suspects have  confessed that they were instructed by Israeli Mosad officers.  The conspiracy is large and serious. It has claimed many  lives, and might have claimed the lives of many schoolboys. It  targets the Lebanese entity, the Lebanese accord, and Lebanese  independence. The Government of Lebanon dissolved the Lebanese  Forces Party after it convicted several of its prominent members  of involvement in the Mosad's plan.    Blowing up the Sayyidat al-Najat Church, which brought death  and injury to many people, followed the Israeli massacre at the  holy Ibrahimi Mosque. Israel believed it could hit two birds  with one stone: Covering up the brutal Hebron massacre and  destroying the large strides Lebanon has taken on the road to  national accord. In the person of the Mosad, Israel planted  several time bombs at schools and public places -- bombs that  would have killed many people, if not for the efforts of the  Lebanese forces that defused them. The Israelis planned for the  bombing conspiracy to increase internal tension to an explosive  point, allowing the Mosad to exploit the sectarian issue.    As a result, the Lebanese soon found themselves on the brink  of a new civil war, the national accord was dissolving, and the  sound of treacherous gunfire was again heard. Israel wants to  avenge Lebanon and the Lebanese because they have stopped their  infighting, restored the Lebanese motherland and its genuine  traditions of love and coexistence, and got down to work to  build their country and restore its vital role in the Arab and  international communities, in full coordination with Syria.    In fact, Israel's daily brutal aggressions against southern  Lebanese villages and cities cannot be isolated from the bombing  plan. It is all the same conspiracy, designed to return Lebanon  to the furnace of civil war, destruction, and agony by creating  a situation in which brothers kill brothers, children die under  the rubble of burning houses, women lose their sons, the  homeland is wiped out, and sectarian sedition rises up amid the  roar of guns.    All this raises a series of persisting questions about  Israel's destructive role in Lebanon and the region. How can  Israel's peace allegations correspond with blowing up the  Sayyidat al-Najat Church in Juniyah, with planting bombs in  Lebanon, and with raining shells on the southern Lebanese  people? While the Israeli Government claims it had no  information about plans to carry out the holy Ibrahimi Mosque  massacre, it cannot disavow Mosad's plans to blow up churches  and schools in Lebanon. The Israeli Army also committed a new  massacre after the holy Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. Yesterday, it  used tank rockets to destroy homes in Hebron, causing scores of  casualties among Palestinian civilians.    Israel's treacherous shells cause scores of casualties among  the Palestinians and the Lebanese every day. Israel does not  care if the victims are women or children. What is important is  to ruin the Lebanese situation and destroy the Palestinian  intifadah. The results, however, run counter to Israel's  expectations. The Lebanese have enhanced their cohesion and  exposed Israel's games. Lebanon's healthy situation and its  accord will block every conspiracy. The Palestinians have also  become more determined to continue their struggle and offer  sacrifices. They are no longer frightened by Israel's tanks or  guns. Israel's destructive role in the region and the peace  process and its attempt to plunge the Middle East into the  furnace of sectarian conflicts are also exposed to the world.  Israel wants to expand and expand. There is no way for that to  happen other than via a trouble-plagued Middle East.    The results of the judiciary investigations in Lebanon  should  open the eyes of many in the West, especially those who have  sympathy for Zionism, to Israel's destructive role. This should  prompt influential sides to curb its aggressive plans, which are  aimed at returning to the law of the jungle and destroying peace  prospects in the Middle East.</p>

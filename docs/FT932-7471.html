			<p>930524 FT  24 MAY 93 / E German steel strike nears end EASTERN GERMANY'S three-week steel strike is expected to end tomorrow following an agreement reached at the weekend between the employers and IG Metall, Germany's powerful metalworkers' union. The 7,000 steel workers who have been on strike since mid-May, mostly in Brandenburg, will be balloted tomorrow. If they accept the deal, it will bring to an end a wave of strikes which threatened to paralyse eastern Germany's industrial sector. Under the terms of the agreement, forged after 13 hours of negotiations, the equalisation of eastern and western German pay levels for the steel sector has been postponed by two years, to April 1996. Until then, wages will reach 80 per cent of western German levels, beginning next month instead of last April, and will rise to 90 per cent in October 1994. At present, incomes in eastern Germany's loss-making steel sector are 60 per cent of western German levels. The agreement is modelled, with modifications, on the Saxony compromise, agreed 10 days ago between employers and IG Metall's metal and electrical sectors. However, the employers can exercise an opt-out, or hardship clause for those enterprises which cannot afford the proposed pay rises. IG Metall had rejected the Saxony compromise as a model for the steel sector on the grounds that it failed to iron out the income differentials between eastern Germany's steel, metal and electrical industries, even though parity among these two sectors does not exist in western Germany. The formula agreed yesterday maintains this income differential, but gives the steel industry in eastern Germany a slight edge over the metal and electrical sectors in terms of income parity with its west German counterparts.</p>

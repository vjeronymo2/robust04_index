			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Marching Toward the Modern Enterprise System" column, by </F> staff reporter Wu Changsheng (0702 7022 3932): "The Market  Calls for a New Role--Reports on Comprehensive Reforms Carried  Out by the Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation (first  installment)"]    [Text] Editor's Note: Clearing Our Thoughts, Doing  Things Discreetly    Beginning today, a series of reports will be published in  this newspaper on the comprehensive reforms carried out by the  Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation. The corporation's  reforms and exploration are still in progress and its experience  is only preliminary. The main reason for a series of reports to  be published on it is that we want the reading public to more  thoroughly understand the basic train of thought of the  corporation's reform. It would never be our aim to encourage  everyone simply to copy the corporation without paying any  attention to his own conditions, neither do we intend to  popularize the Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation as a  so-called "model." Since different localities have different  conditions, the exploration of reform can be and should be  varied, but a common point of departure must be grasped firmly,  which is to develop and strengthen the state-owned economy and  to ensure that the value of state-owned assets can be maintained  and increased. This is also the basic point of the reform  experience of Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation.    Once the train of thought of reform is determined, concrete  work must be done in a safe and discreet manner. Strategic  considerations are not tantamount to tactical operations.  Negative effects may be brought about if one stresses only good  wishes while doing one's work, but disregards the peculiarities  of the time and the situation. For example, we can never take  the flexible use of assets as simply the reorientation of land  use; neither can we set off another upsurge of real estate  development in the name of learning from the Beijing First Light  Industrial Corporation. State-owned assets cover a very wide  range, and land is only a very small part.    Shortage of funds, overabundance of personnel, and rigid  asset application are the three problems generally being  encountered by state-owned enterprises at present. Under the  guidance of Comrade Xiaoping's southern-tour remarks and the  spirit of the 14th Party Congress, the Beijing First Light  Industrial Corporation proceeded from reality to blaze a new  trail of comprehensive reforms in asset appreciation,  transformation of industries, transformation of functions,  transformation of the mechanism, and transfer of workers and  staff to other work units, thus finding the key to solving these  three problems.    According to comrades of the Beijing First Light Industrial  Corporation, rigid asset application is the knot of the three  problems, and the others can be solved readily once this knot is  untied. Therefore, although many aspects are involved in the  Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation's reform, the  enterprise ownership reform remains its nucleus.    How did they untie the knot? What kind of key did they find?  We will publish four reports to answer these questions one by  one. Our reporters still found it interesting to address the  issue after finishing four reports on it. Hence, we will  publish a fifth report, in which the reporter and people  concerned will speak on what we actually get from the reforms  carried out by the Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation.  Of course, the reading public is very welcome to discuss this  with us. [end editor's note]    "The starting point of the Beijing First Light Industrial  Corporation is not a premeditated scheme, but practice. Up to  now, they have taken an entirely step-by-step approach to work."    -- Opening remarks made by a comrade of the Beijing First  Light Industrial Corporation who was familiar with the whole  process of systematic reform    In a football game, "offside" means breaking the rules.  In order to find a way out for the enterprise, the Beijing  First Light Industrial Corporation was unconsciously on the  "offside"--turning its attention from dealing with products to  dealing with state-owned assets. A fortuitous "offside" made an  impact on the whole system.    State-owned enterprises abstain from talking about "death,"  and so did the Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation.  Although the Bankruptcy Law was introduced several years ago,  and the idea of "euthanasia" is accepted by more and more  people, after all, owing to environmental limitations, only a  few enterprises have resorted to "euthanasia." Many enterprises  originally thinking of an "easy death" often give up the idea  because they "cannot bear such a death" and they are still  bitterly fighting for their "mere existence."    To our surprise, however, the Beijing First Light Industrial  Corporation miraculously and quietly "died" in the past two  years or so, without causing any sloppiness or trouble.    The first case in point was the former Beijing No. 2  Eyeglasses Plant. From 1984 on, faced with increasingly fierce  market competition, the plant failed again and again. In 1991,  the capacity utilization rate was less than 30 percent, the  annual per capita income of workers and staff was a mere 2,400  yuan, and the plant's deficits accumulated to 1.2 million yuan.  At the same time, hundreds of individual household traders  emerged around there who were running eyeglasses industries and  processing eyeglasses, and their business was good. After  conscientiously weighing the pros and cons, the plant decided to  "transfer" from the "secondary industry" to "tertiary industry."  With the support of industrial and commercial departments, in  August 1991, the Beijing No. 2 Eyeglasses Plant was transformed  into a specialized eyeglasses wholesale market with over 500  stalls, which attracted not only numerous individual household  traders in the area, but foreign businessmen as well. The  annual turnover reached 130 million yuan, which not only offset  the enterprise's deficits, but reaped more than 1 million yuan  of profits. Former staff and workers changed their occupations  and acted as security guards, cleaners, and transport personnel,  and the annual per capita income almost doubled. Last year, the  Beijing No. 1 Eyeglasses Plant -- an "associate" of the Beijing  No. 2 Eyeglasses Plant which also was running in the red -- was  incorporated into the eyeglasses market. The largest eyeglasses  center in our country will be built here.    The second case was that of the No. 1 Branch Factory of  the Beijing Lighting Equipment Company. From 1988 onward, this  factory -- which produced traditional lamps for civilian,  industrial, and mining use -- was in a predicament. In 1991, it  incurred more than 500,000 yuan in deficits. The company took  notice of the superiority of the No. 1 Branch Factory's  location, in the bustling Xizhimen section, and decided to  rebuild it into a commercial building that would specialize in  selling communications equipment. In August 1992, the building  opened for business. Although it was owned by the state, the  business was privately run and contracted by staff and workers.  In consequence, it reaped 160,000 yuan in profits in 1992 and  over 2 million yuan the following year.    The third case was that of the Beijing Lamp Factory. Owing  to its running in the red and incurring debts year after year,  the factory was incorporated into the Xinhai Instrument Company  in September 1992. The lamp factory's former main production  building was rebuilt into the Caishikou Xinguang Commercial  Building, of which some floors were leased, while some others  were used by the company for sales of instruments and lamps.  Last year, the commercial building reaped more than 700,000  yuan in profits and the income of staff and workers increased by  over 40 percent. Most of the staff and workers were transferred  to a piano plant that was short of labor. In consequence, the  piano plant was able quickly to expand its scale of production  and increase its output, profits, and taxes.    Viewed from the product angle, these factories -- as  enterprises manufacturing certain kinds of light industrial  products -- really are "dead," and they have been removed from  the "roll" of secondary industry. Viewed from the enterprise  angle, they are still open for business, and their staff and  workers are still working and being paid because, even though  the "secondary industry" is dead, the "tertiary industry" was  born. Viewed from the angle of assets, state-owned assets --  which are created by state investment -- are neither dead nor  lost, but reinvigorated with their value greatly increased!    All these things are neither readjustment of the product  structure nor simply industrial transformation, but indicate a  kind of change in nature -- breaking through the barriers of  products and industries, and achieving a transformation from the  running of a certain kind of products to the running of  state-owned assets. Although the transformation was started  unconsciously and at a time when the goal of socialist market  economic reform had not been clearly fixed, real actions were  taken, and they have successfully redistributed resources while  standing in the commanding position of running the main body of  assets and following the market course.    This kind of unconscious "offside" practice has not only  reshaped the enterprises' external images and transformed their  internal mechanism, but more important, has had a huge impact on  the Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation as a whole.    An "offside" is often the starting point of reform.  When people are aware of the fact that an "offside" precisely  fills the "gap" of owners (representatives) of state-owned  assets, "filling the gap" will become a strong voluntary  demand.    The Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation, which was  formed and departmentalized according to product categories  during the planned-economy period, once scored brilliant  achievements. Not to mention the "three renowned pieces" --  watches, bicycles, and sewing machines -- which were popular,  personnel of the Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation are  really proud of the fact that the "Beibingyang" soft drink and  "Hongxing" sorghum spirits monopolized the capital's market for  a long time.    After the policy of reform and opening up was started,  however, the Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation came  across the problems generally encountered by state-owned  enterprises. Moreover, the corporation was faced with more and  more special problems: Small production scale, obsolete  equipment, overabundance of personnel, and low-technology  products. In consequence, the corporation failed again and  again because it could hardly adapt itself to the intense market  competition. The most distressing problem was that owing to the  expansion of urban districts, many factories that lay between  residential and commercial districts became annoyances and were  urgently required to move elsewhere. However, there simply was  no way to raise 1.5 billion yuan for moving expenses. Up to the  early 1990's, 30 percent of the more than 120 enterprises under  the Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation were in the red,  and products manufactured by over 35 percent of these  enterprises were unsalable. From 1990 to 1992, the whole  corporation earned fewer and fewer profits, which dropped from  110 million yuan to 90 million yuan and then to just over 60  million yuan.    As a matter of fact, like all other state-owned enterprises  in the last decade or so, the Beijing First Light Industrial  Corporation also made constant progress by following the general  trend of reform. It delegated power to lower levels and let  them retain a proportion of profits, changed profits into taxes,  implemented the contract responsibility system, and put the  Regulations into effect, without missing any single link. All  of these reforms played a positive part in promoting the  development of the enterprises, and a small number of the  enterprises still were faring quite well. We should say that  without implementing these reform measures, the Beijing First  Light Industrial Corporation certainly would have encountered  many more difficulties than it did. As far as the whole body is  concerned, however, the situation of the Beijing First Light  Industrial Corporation was becoming more and more grimm. By  drawing on the experience of coastal areas and by  conscientiously analyzing the situation of the enterprises under  the corporation after Comrade Xiaoping had made his  southern-tour remarks in 1992, the decision-makers at the  Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation concluded:  Objectively speaking, the corporation was being surrounded by  five "circles" -- joint-venture enterprises, town and township  enterprises, enterprises in special economic zones, civilian-run  enterprises, and import goods -- and subjectively speaking, the  corporation was still fettered by five shackles -- the petty  production concept, the influence of "leftist" ideology, the  sluggish transformation of government functions, the ossified  administrative system, and an inflexible operational mechanism.  In addition, the corporation bore three heavy burdens  --overabundance of personnel, shortage of funds, and  difficulties in making an inventory of assets.    Where does the crux of this situation lie? -- Sluggish  reform. A vertical view shows that in the past, the Beijing  First Light Industrial Corporation based its reform primarily on  improving a single type of product, to the benefit of a single  enterprise, but nothing was done explicitly to set a goal for  preserving and heightening the value of state-owned assets.  Moreover, its enterprises did not have the right to manage the  assets and they need not and could not flexibly distribute  resources within a wider scope in light of changes in market  demand, hence its enterprises could not sustain deficits once  incurred. As far as the ultimate ownership is concerned, the  assets of these enterprises belong to the state, a fact that is  never ambiguous, but in reality, it is very difficult for the  state to be concretely in charge of each of the enterprises,  thus giving rise to the phenomenon of a "gap" in the main body  of ownership. Filling the "gap" has become a task of paramount  importance in deepening the reform of state-owned enterprises.  One of the important factors accounting for stronger vitality  of joint-venture, private, and stockholding enterprises is  precisely the availability of ownership representatives, and  basically, the nonexistence of the nominal post of "person-in  charge." A lateral view shows that past reform attached  importance to making a breakthrough in a single area while  neglecting the importance of promoting corresponding progress in  other areas, hence the short-term effect was prominent, but  after some time, the effect gradually faded and the reform was  subject to various limitations. The market is ruthless, and  market competition at present is, in reality, a competition of  reform. Anyone who is sluggish in reform will become passive  and may be thrown out of the market, which is developing at a  high speed! This is the truth proven by innumerable facts.    Reform must be deepened vigorously! Reform must be  promoted in a comprehensive manner! At a moment when its fate  hung in the balance, the Beijing First Light Industrial  Corporation had no retreat, but could only make this choice.  How to make things work, however, is a very realistic  problem.    Some people suggested that the 120 or so enterprises could  part company with each other and each seek its own way out.  However, as proven by practice, this method will not work.  Some enterprises can "fight their way out of the heavy  encirclement," but owing to different bases and qualities, a  considerable number of enterprises still, just as in the past  several years, will be in a state of not knowing whether they  can survive or not, and it is inevitable that they will blindly  readjust their structure, thus causing great losses to the  Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation, which is a  state-owned asset. As far as comprehensive reform is concerned,  it is impossible for any single enterprise to accomplish it.  Not to mention other problems, under the present circumstances  in which the social security system is not yet perfect, the mere  existence of several tens of thousands of personnel seeking  reemployment and over 20,000 retired staff and workers is  sufficient to have quite a large impact on social stability.    Could all the work be handled and administered entirely by  the municipal government? Such a practice does not accord with  the reform orientation of separating the functions and  responsibilities of administration from those of management, and  in reality, this will not work. In the past several decades,  the government has played a role of chief factory director  bearing "unlimited responsibilities." The conclusion was  reached long ago in history: Facing the volatile market and tens  of thousands of enterprises, the government cannot and does not  have the strength to handle all the work.    The Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation, with  billions  in state-owned assets, had an urgent need for a genuine  "person-in-charge," and the corporation's more than 100  enterprises were eager to have an "operator" to coordinate their  comprehensive reform. It was precisely under such circumstances  that a new role mounted the great stage of the market economy,  and the first company in Beijing for the management of  state-owned assets -- the Beijing First Light Industrial  Corporation -- emerged as required by the times!</p>

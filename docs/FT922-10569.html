			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / AT&amp;T offers a telephone number for life AMERICANS are to be offered a personal telephone number for life, the perfect accessory for a nation whose citizens move house an average of 11 times. In June, AT&amp;T, the US telecommunications group, will introduce a personal telephone number that will allow subscribers to be reached at any telephone in the continental US. AT&amp;T's Easy Reach 700 service provides subscribers with a personal identification number - their own access number to the service. The number need not change if the subscriber moves house within the US. Although call-forwarding is already available, Easy Reach subscribers not only have a number for life but can also select which calls they want forwarded to them at any location. At Dollars 7 (Pounds 3.90) a month the service will not be cheap for consumers used to receiving telephone numbers free. Calls within the US will cost 25 cents a minute between 8am and 5pm and 15 cents a minute at other times. The idea of personal telephone numbers has been mooted in Europe, but most European countries see it as 10 years away. BT price cut urged, Page 10</p>

			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / International Company News: Vice-chairman quits Upjohn MR William Parfet, until earlier this year a likely candidate to head Upjohn, the US drugs company, resigned as a vice-chairman yesterday. He will, however, remain a non-executive director, writes Richard Waters in New York. Mr Parfet, a great-grandson of the company's founder, became the second of the company's three vice-chairman to announce his resignation since Mr Ley Smith took over as acting chief executive in April.</p>

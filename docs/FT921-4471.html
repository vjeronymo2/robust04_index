			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / Technology: Taxing time for software Robin Cooke-Hurle, managing director of Taxsoft, a small software house, has a recurring nightmare before the UK's annual Budget day. The chancellor of the exchequer gets to his feet, discusses the economy and then announces a raft of new legislation giving big tax advantages to the software industry. Equally substantial changes to Taxsoft's programs will be required. Cooke-Hurle wakes in a cold sweat. Taxsoft is one of the few companies specialising in taxation software for corporations and for personal taxation. It claims that eight of the top 10 accountancy firms use its products and that the tax departments of 20 per cent of the UK's top 500 companies are customers, giving it an 80 per cent share of the corporate tax market. Tax software suppliers are a small, exclusive club. At the upper end of the spectrum there are only a handful of competitors including CSM, Data Sciences and Solution 6. Each year, the race is to get the latest version of the software, incorporating all the Budget changes, out to clients within 24 hours of Budget day. If the new version is late, Taxsoft's customers lose competitive advantage; if it is pushed out too soon, its integrity could be compromised. The company employs two full-time tax specialists, recruited from large companies, and about a dozen programmers. The most difficult part of the operation is finding ways for the tax experts to communicate with the programmers. 'We have not solved that one yet,' Cooke-Hurle muses. The company has its own language, appropriately called 'T' to describe tax legislation. Customers pay a yearly fee - which varies according to the size and complexity of the version - for the software which includes all modifications and alterations. In this election year, for example, there could be two Budgets. But it is profitable work. With a turnover of about Pounds 2m, the gross profit margin is about 30 per cent.</p>

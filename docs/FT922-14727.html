			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / Books: England's golden age: when life was a riot - Mark Archer on a study of violence in the Hanoverian century RIOTS, RISINGS AND REVOLUTION by Ian Gilmour Hutchinson Pounds 25, 504 pages 'VERY GREAT Rebellion in France': Parson Woodforde's diary entry on the fall of the Bastille, almost overlooked between remarks about Somerset's bad weather and the purchase of a fine crab for one shilling, has long seemed to sum up the spirit of self-contented repose which settled over England during the Hanoverian Age. In reality, as Ian Gilmour's fascinating study shows - it is subtitled Governance and Violence in 18th Century England - the kingdom was deeply divided; riots over politics, food and religion were endemic. The realm was twice threatened by Jacobite rebellions, in 1715 and 1745, while the Gordon Riots in 1780 came close to toppling the state. In spite of the relative liberty of English institutions, the English penal code was the harshest in Europe. Stealing a handkerchief, consorting with gypsies and cutting down growing trees were among 200 capital offences. A 'multitude of unhappy wretches,' Mandeville wrote in 1725, 'every year are put to death for trifles.' Government was notorious for place-trading and corruption. Violence was a fundamental fact of life. 'In the 18th century few people disapproved of violence as such; the cause or the objective of the riot determined for the majority the view they took of it.' The quality and the mob were not two classes but the same people. When Pitt received the Freedom of the City of London, members of Brooks's set about his coach with bludgeons, wrecking it and injuring his servants. Indeed, Gilmour argues that the liberty allowed to violence, especially mob rule, was essential to keeping the institutions of King, Lords and Commons in balance. Faced with the institutionalised violence of the press-gang, game laws and the harsh preponderance of capital offences in favour of property, the mob's violence was seldom against persons and generally inspired by a perceived injustice. Gilmour's heroes are easy to spot: Burke, for one, who disagreed with those who were 'against disturbing the public repose; I like a clamour whenever there is an abuse. The fire-bell at midnight disturbs your repose, but it keeps you from being burned in your bed', and Wilkes. 'In the 18th century two strands of protest can be differentiated although they occasionally intermingled: one, which ran from the Sacheverell riots to the Jewish Naturalisation Bill to the Gordon Riots, was the producer and product of prejudice and fanaticism; it served no useful purpose. The other, which ran through many food riots, the turnpike riots, some of the election riots and the Wilkite disturbances, had a strong feeling for law and custom and was seeking to make the authorities do their job or to reform them; often its violence was almost non-violent, and it was usually salutary.' In a short review it is difficult to do justice to the scope and intelligence of this marvellous account of a much misunderstood age. It is old-fashioned history-writing at its best, full of incident, personalities and intriguing facts. One moment we are with Lord Gordon on the Commons balcony, giving the crowd bulletins about the debate inside ('Lord North calls you a mob]'), the next we are in the midst of a fascinating aside on duelling, its characters ('of the 14 Prime Ministers between 1779 and the repeal of the Corn Laws, six - Shelburne, Fox, Pitt, Canning, Wellington and Peel - fought or tried to fight a duel') and its pretexts ('Lord Falkland was killed because when drunk he said to Mr Powell, who was also drunk, 'What, drunk again tonight, Pogey?''). Analysing the 1715 and '45 rebellions Gilmour shows how the English Jacobites preferred toasting their king across the water to risking violence. And like the best histories, Gilmour's is full of tantalising 'what might have beens': 'If the Jacobite invasion had occurred in 1740-41, after two very bad harvests and with Walpole still in power, it would probably have been far better received; by 1745 Walpole was gone, and the last four harvests had all been good.' Disraeli's verdict on the 18th-century was that 'a people without power or education had been induced to believe themselves the freest and most enlightened nation in the world.' According to Gilmour, this could not have been achieved without the safety-valve of violence. The patriotic pride of 18th-century country parsons, though justified, rested on a paradox.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] San Salvador, 16 Mar (DPA) -- The Supreme Electoral  Tribunal, the foremost electoral body, has announced that the  Salvadoran Army will be confined to its barracks during the  general elections on Sunday, 20 March.    The National Civilian Police (PNC) and the National Police,  which is currently being phased out, will provide security for  the elections, which are scheduled to begin at 0700 and end at  1700.    PNC Director Jose Maria Monterrey said some 4,000 policemen  will guard the national polling places in a joint effort with  the National Police. The PNC, a new corps that emerged as a  result of the 1992 peace agreements ending a 12-year war,  currently covers only seven of the country's 14 departments.  The PNC will be at the service of the TSE in all remote regions  and will be equipped with modern radio equipment, Monterrey  announced.    For his part, National Police Director Samuel Dolores  Cuellar  said that for the last time -- since it is supposed to be phased  out in September -- the National Police will have 4,193  policemen posted at 148 polling places throughout the country.    The police chief added that the National Police will provide  protection in the capital and in the principal cities of Santa  Ana, San Miguel, Ahuachapan, Sonsonate, and La Libertad  Departments.    The Armed Forces will have the sole duty of assisting the  TSE  in the immediate transfer of vote count certificates or election  officials aboard helicopters. Party officials and observers  will always be present at such times.    For their part, the political parties, with the  participation  of the UN Observers for El Salvador (Onusal), have signed  documents and commitments wherein they appeal to their party  rank and file to observe the necessary prudence and to avoid  acts of violence as electoral tension increases.    Six parties and a three-party alliance will participate in  the presidential elections. The alliance, however, will not  participate as such in the legislative and municipal elections.    The elections are for the presidency of the Republic, 84  deputy seats, and municipal councilmen positions in 262  municipalities.    The parties with the best chances are the ruling Nationalist  Republican Alliance (ARENA), the leftist presidential coalition  [Democratic Convergence-Farabundo Marti National Liberation  Front-National Revolutionary Movement Coalition] and Christian  Democracy, which has been relegated to third place.    Other rightist parties are the National Coalition (PCN), the  Authentic Christian Movement (MAC), the Unity Movement, and the  National Solidarity Movement, all of which have slim chances.</p>

			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Commission finds itself under siege A SIEGE mentality grips the Breydel, the ultra-modern building in the centre of Brussels and home of the much reviled, much misunderstood European Commission. As the dream of a centralised European union of 12 states built around the Maastricht Treaty has faded, the Commission's 12,000 staff fear they have become the whipping-boys of the European Community. At best, they admit, the glorious 1980s when the Commission reached the peak of its power will not be repeated for a long time to come. This week, many of the Commission's fears were confirmed when German Chancellor Helmut Kohl launched a fierce attack on the Brussels bureaucracy. Citing European public opinion, he said Brussels was 'too powerful, constantly expanding, and exterminating national identities'. Mr Graham Meadows, an expert on regional policy who has worked for 17 years at the Commission, says the scale of criticism is becoming unbearable. 'It is getting to the point where you are putting the Community in jeopardy; all this criticism is sapping the institution's confidence.' Mr David Williamson, secretary general of the Commission, the top job in the Brussels bureaucracy, is less apocalyptic. But he agrees that ever since Danish voters rejected the Maastricht Treaty on European political and monetary union last June, it has suited friend and foes alike to single out the Commission as a power-hungry, centralising technocracy. The result, he says, is that the Commission is exercising restraint. All legislative directives are on hold to check whether they are really necessary. The Commission's workload has dropped sharply. Elsewhere Mr Pascal Lamy, the powerful chief of staff to Commission president Jacques Delors, has asked all EC member states to send in examples of Commission meddling. Yet Mr Williamson, who used to advise Mrs Margaret Thatcher on Europe when she was British prime minister, correctly points out that it is not the Commission but the member states themselves who usually put forward the most controversial proposals - and who introduced 94 per cent of all legislation in 1990. And, he stresses, it is the member states themselves who bear the ultimate responsibility for passing the legislation through the European Council. So why is the Commission suddenly in the firing line? It has long suited EC ministers to blame Brussels when they have had to compromise or lose in Council debates; this tendency increases in hard economic times. Mr Meadows argues that weaker European leaders have become expert at 'laying off' blame for their own domestic problems. 'That's why the British have blamed the Germans for the devaluation of the pound,' he says. The big loser in the current blame game is Mr Delors, the architect of the 1992 single European market and the driving force - along with Mr Kohl and President Francois Mitterrand of France - behind the Maastricht Treaty. No one should count Mr Delors out; he is too much of an intellectual force and bureaucratic in-fighter to be written off. But as one senior EC official said recently, Mr Delors was only as strong in the 1980s as the member states allowed him to be. Now that the public in key nation states such as France, Germany and Britain are having second thoughts about Maastricht and the pace of European integration, Mr Delors, and the Commission, are much weaker than the popular rhetoric might suggest.</p>

			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / UK Company News: Aran Energy raises stake in Alba field A much reduced tax credit left net profits at Aran Energy, the Dublin-based oil and gas exploration group, sharply lower in 1990. After a tax credit of IPounds 54,000 (IPounds 1m), profit came to IPounds 390,000, or about Pounds 352,000 sterling, against IPounds 646,000 previously. Earnings per share fell to 0.19p (0.4p). Aran also announced yesterday that it has raised its interest in the Alba oil field from 3 per cent to 5 per cent through an assets swap with Conoco, plus payment by the latter of Dollars 4m (Pounds 2.34m). During 1990 a rights issue to raise some IPounds 37.4m was made to fund exploration activities.</p>

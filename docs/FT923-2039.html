			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / HK airport proposals criticised PRO-BEIJING newspapers yesterday published strong criticism of Hong Kong's revised proposals for financing its new airport, raising doubts about whether China would agree to them. The newspapers called the plan to raise direct government investment in the HKDollars 163.7bn (Pounds 11.2bn) project by HKDollars 40bn 'insincere and unconstructive'. Ta Kung Pao, a communist newspaper, said the government had 'ignored the principle of cost-effectiveness, spending Hong Kong taxpayers' money at its discretion on the one hand and trying to use the special administrative region government's profits in advance on the other'. Wen Wei Po, another newspaper, said: 'The financial problem can only be solved when the British side comes up with a proposal that can reduce costs.' Mr Hamish Macleod, financial secretary, said he was disappointed by the reaction, but the government would wait to hear China's official response.</p>

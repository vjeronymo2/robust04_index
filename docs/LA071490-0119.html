			<p><P> July 14, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Insider Trading Conviction Upheld: U.S. District Judge Stephen Wilson upheld an  insider trader conviction against Brian J. Callahan, an Anaheim stockbroker,  and William N. Jackson, a Torrance printer, ruling that the defendants engaged  in securities fraud when they traded stocks based on information culled from  advance copies of Business Week magazine. The men were convicted in May of  conspiring to make profit by trading stocks based on information not yet  available to the public. The men had challenged the conviction, contending that  there were no securities violations because they did not obtain information  directly from companies in which they invested.  </P></p>

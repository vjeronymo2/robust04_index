			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / Vienna 4: (9): Dramas made out of a crisis - The federal theatre's problems THE Bundestheater Verband, the Austrian federal theatre company, has seen its share of troubles in recent months. First came a public storm over the director of the Burgtheater, Mr Claus Peymann, whose contract was renewed despite widespread condemnation of his management style. Just when the controversy regarding Austria's foremost theatre abated and the outspoken Viennese audiences had settled back to grumbling quietly about falling standards and neglect of tradition, the director of the State Opera died of a heart attack at the end of March, after only seven months in the office. The death of Eberhard Waechter, who was 62, 'is a disaster for the Staatsoper,' says Mr Georg Springer, the general manager of Bundestheater. 'Waechter had been the reason for a major structural change at the opera.' One of world's leading baritones, Waechter had been manager of the smaller Volksoper, or People's Opera, and his appointment as Staatsoper director put the two houses for the first time under a single leadership. As a result, smaller productions could be shifted to the Volksoper, used predominantly for operettas, thus raising its often belittled artistic level. The void left by Waechter will be hard to fill. Mr Ian Holender, co-director of the Staatsoper in change of administration, was immediately named to lead the two institutions by himself, but that is seen as an interim solution. Without Waechter's authority, Mr Holender will have a hard time to carry out the new concept of opera management that was introduced last year amid loud protests by Vienna's artistic opinion-makers. The double crisis at the Bundestheater is no small affair for Vienna. The state-owned theatre group claims to be the world largest stage company, with annual turnover of more than Sch2bn. As only a quarter of that is met by ticket sales, covering the deficit is a constant and growing burden on Austria's federal budget. The four theatres of the Bundestheater play a central role in Austria's art-obsessed capital. The Staatsoper, in a league only with the Metropolitan Opera in New York and the Scala in Milan, is Vienna's greatest tourist attraction, and the Burgtheater and its smaller offshoot, the Akademietheater, aspire to lead the German-speaking drama world. Debates over personnel and policy decisions at the theatres regularly fill the pages of Austrian newspapers and preoccupy the intellectual and social elites in the city for weeks. At the Burgtheater, German-born Mr Peymann has aroused the ire of the conservative audience with innovative plays and staging approaches since coming to Vienna from Bochum in 1986. He brought a group of excellent German actors with him, driving many of local favourites, with life-time contracts at the Burgtheater, off the stage. Critics claim that he has concentrated too much on showpiece productions, many of them directed by himself, while neglecting the day-to-day operations of the theatre. Those voices grew louder at the beginning of the year when extended rehearsals for a Macbeth production directed by Mr Peymann forced the Burgtheater to keep its doors shut for more than a dozen nights. The cancellations upset the theatre's most loyal audience, the holders of season tickets, and prompted some to return their tickets, which are often passed down from generation to generation. However, the opening of Macbeth was a success, like most of Mr Peymann's cherished Shakespeare productions, but reviewers suggested that he could have achieved the same with less turmoil. 'The shock over Macbeth went deep,' says Mr Springer, the Bundestheater manager. 'Peymann had to learn the hard way that as a manager, he cannot afford to be put in such a position by Peymann, the artist.' When Mr Rudolf Scholten, Austria's minister of education and the arts, extended Mr Peymann's contract in February just before the opening of Macbeth, it sparked a revolt among the Burgtheater's disgruntled staff. The actors' council, including Mr Klaus Maria Brandauer, resigned in protest and demanded fundamental change. Mr Springer says the dispute between Mr Peymann and the actors has so far not been resolved. 'The peace (in the theatre) is not one of satisfaction or resignation, but it's the peace of the graveyard,' he says. 'The atmosphere in the house is worrying.' A very different strategy was adopted by Eberhard Waechter and Mr Holender, the former owner of a major artists' agency. Rather than pouring millions into a few star productions, the two managers undertook an overhaul of the regular nightly programme seen by most tourists and regular local visitors. 'The repertory was rotten. It was high time to improve it - it had fallen apart materially and artistically,' says Mr Springer. Rather than depend solely on international stars, the Waechter/Holender team started to build up a reservoir of younger singers who would stay with the opera for a few years. The price was to do without any new productions in the first season, which the public did not seem to mind, but many art critics called a sell-out. Mr Springer says the attacks on the concept were 'not only nonsense, but infamy'. In the season starting in September the Staatsoper has scheduled as many new productions as in the past, including all of Richard Wagner's 'Ring der Nibelungen' cycle. The Staatsoper is also sponsoring three new opera compositions over the next five years. While the joint management between Staatsoper and Volksoper is likely to end, as Mr Holender is apparently not interested in leading both opera houses, Mr Springer says he is aiming for a closer co-operation of the Staatsoper with the city-owned Theater an der Wien, one of its oldest theatres and today its main stage for musicals. When Mr Peter Weck, director of that theatre, staged one of the world's best productions of Andrew Lloyd Webber's Cats in 1983 and managed to fill the auditorium for seven seasons, Vienna's city officials thought they had found the key to commercial success. Mr Weck was made director of all three theatres owned by the city, where he continued to stage international blockbuster musicals. But even he failed to turn in a profit, and as his contract expires at the end of this year, a new manager is sought who could broaden the theatres' repertory beyond the standard London and New York musicals. The city is also looking for a private operator at the Ronacher, a 120-year-old variety theatre now under Mr Weck's directorship. This run-down hall needs renovation. Blueprints for construction of a Sch900m multi-stage centre by the avant-garde architecture firm Coop Himmelblau were recently abandoned in favour of a less expensive, less interesting design.</p>

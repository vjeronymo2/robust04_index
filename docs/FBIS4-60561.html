			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Laurence Peter] </F>   [Excerpt] Sanaa, May 25 (AFP) -- Hundreds of mourners bayed  for the blood of southern leader 'Ali 'Salim al-Bid Wednesday  [25 May] as they buried victims of Monday's Scud missile attack  on the capital.    Crowds lined the streets here as the bodies covered in white  shrouds were carried aloft on stretchers from the central mosque  to the At-Tahrir (Freedom) cemetery.    "Death to 'Ali Salim al-Bid" they chanted at the cemetery  gates, as the funerals of the first nine victims took place.  They included three children, one of them a toddler buried next  to its mother.    Officials in Sanaa said at least 13 people were killed and  more than 100 injured when the missile struck a  densely-populated area of the capital late Monday, destroying  houses and damaging a hospital.    Meanwhile a southern military spokesman in Aden said 400  northern troops had been killed in fierce fighting around the  key military base of Al-'Anad, which the south had recaptured  from the north.    Fighting has raged around the base, 60 kilometres (36 miles)  north of the southern stronghold of Aden, since civil war broke  out on May 5 between troops loyal to President 'Ali 'Abdallah  Salih and forces headed by his southern rival al-Bid.    The base, at the gateway to the road to Aden, was seized by  northern troops on May 17. There had been no confirmation or  denial from Sanaa Wednesday that it had lost control.    In the capital, Monday's missile attack provoked outrage  among mourners who gathered to witness the funerals.    "This is a criminal act. More rockets will increase our  determination to cleanse our Yemeni land of the criminals' dirty  bodies," said Husayn al-Sayaghi, a 42-year-old engineer.    At least 22 surface-to-surface missiles have been fired by  southern troops into the north of Yemen since the start of  hostilities. The north has also retaliated by firing missiles  on Aden.    Koranic verses were chanted during the burials, as  gravediggers lowered the bodies into the graves and then filled  them in with stone blocks and wet clay.    They had been brought in Red Crescent vans to the central  Qubbat al-Mutawakkil (Dome of the Faithful) mosque for prayers,  before being taken to the cemetery.    In Aden a spokesman said that troops from the newly declared  Yemeni Democratic Republic had inflicted "heavy losses on enemy  troops on all the war fronts."    Witnesses said northern troops had kept up the pressure on  southern troops deployed around Aden in a bid to defend the city  from a northern advance.    A southern spokesman said in Kharaz Bab el-Mandeb, west of  Aden, "all enemy units had been wiped out" by troops, while in  Abyan in the east of Aden "hundreds of northern troops had been  killed or wounded" in a southern counter-offensive.    Fighting was still reported in the vital oil-rich province  of  Shabwah. [passage omitted]</p>

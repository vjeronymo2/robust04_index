			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / Arts: Richard Strauss celebrated - Opera in San Francisco It is a particular as well as a general pity that the Celebration of Richard Strauss that just ended is, for budget reasons, the last San Francisco Opera summer season for the foreseeable future. Since, despite an adequately high level of singing throughout the festival, there were no standout performances in major roles, the company's orchestra emerged the festival's 'star.' Now it seems that without this valuable performance and rehearsal time with its new music director, Donald Runnicles (who conducted Salome and Capriccio), and principal guest, Charles Mackerras (who led Der Rosenkavalier), the opera orchestra can only suffer. The ensemble's alert responses to the full complement of Strauss styles  - early, middle, and late - as well to three conductors (Andrew Davis led two concert performances of Daphne), was appreciable. But its craft and versatility shone brightest in adversity: having to sound at full cry for Salome while holding back to accommodate the severely compromised performance of Maria Ewing in the title role. The old question of whether it was wise for Ewing to take up the role for the by now much-travelled Peter Hall production seems answerable in an unambiguous 'No.' Not only can the Ewing soprano no longer soar over the full orchestra at climaxes, it skips over many of the 'little notes' that lend the role so much of its musical interest. From performance to performance (I heard two), Ewing recomposed the part for her comfort; little wonder that, her famous strip to the buff notwithstanding, the most memorable part of her Salome is her pout. The Herods, king and queen, fared far better, with both Robert Tear and Leonie Rysanek giving sophisticated, richly detailed vocal and dramatic readings - and Rysanek sounding as if she could have sung the title role with ease (and the vocal generosity she always lent it). If Tom Fox's Jokanaan lacked a certain aura of mystery, it was still strong and impressive - even if the often misguided restaging by Jeanette Aster gave us a prophet who could not keep his eyes off the sultry princess. Elevating his orchestra to the status of another character, Runnicles presided over a drama of feral cunning and thrust. What his Salome offered in sound and fury, his Capriccio delivered in subtlety and nuance. Except for some occasionally faulty intonation from the strings his players produced a shimmering tapestry of sound: fine filigree over a gracefully suspended long line. Co-ordination between pit and stage was exemplary. Revisions to the Mauro Pagano production, similarly familiar to London audiences from a previous Covent Garden outing, will be revealed in a live video recording. In general it seemed improved by Thierry Bosquet's period costumes, replacing the misogynist Versace designs that lent visual confusion to the original production. Kiri Te Kanawa sounded better too; by now having learned the role in its particulars, she singing it half-ardently. Still, opulent sounds and arching phrases were not enough to convince one that she had strong, let alone conflicted, feelings about either words or music, poet or composer - or, for that matter, much interest in dinner. (The production's one genuinely touching performance was Michel Senechal's show-stopping Monsieur Taupe.) Hakan Hagegard, as the Count, and Victor Braun, as La Roche, made similar, if paler, impressions compared with their first outings in this production. While David Kuebler caught neither the character of Flamand nor his music, Simon Keenlyside compensated with a beautifully inflected, deeply sympathetic Olivier - one that tipped the balance in the direction of words with, however ironically, high musicality. Still, the most fullest, most rewarding characterisation was Tatiana Troyanos' text-savoring, handsomely sung Clairon. The already grateful pairing of Capriccio and Der Rosenkavalier was further enhanced by a similarity in production style. Lotfi Mansouri's 'new' Rosenkavalier sought to recreate both the Alfred Roller designs of the Dresden premiere and the original staging as reflected in the production book. The sets emerged breath-catchingly, absorbingly beautiful, the direction a bit by the numbers and characteristically broad and physical. Felicity Lott introduced an accurate, well defined, patrician, and ultimately unmoving Marschallin; Frederica von Stade her well-known, urgent Octavian (though a bit vocally constricted and, well, more mannish than boyish in her late San Francisco debut of the role); and Christina Schaefer a perky if small-voiced Sophie. Eric Halvorson's sumptuously voiced Ochs seemed otherwise generic. Musically, the show belonged to Mackerras, who seemed unerring in his choices of what to accent in this busiest of scores ' while making sure that all its music told. His sympathy with the singers seemed sometimes finer-grained than theirs with their characters. In the event, the concert Daphne seemed a trifle pointless (if not a pointless trifle). Davis oversaw a performance that seemed sufficiently long-lined, rhapsodic, and airy - but that felt more a reflection of what the orchestra could accomplish with little rehearsal than a serious reading of the work. The only singing of lasting interest was Jon Frederic West's knowing, passionate Apollo and Janice Watson's silvery (if somewhat monochrome) Daphne.</p>

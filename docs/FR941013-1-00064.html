			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Source Category Description  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Hazardous Air Pollutant Types  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The specific chemicals, compounds, or groups of compounds designated by Congress to be HAP are listed in CAA section 112(b). Both organic and inorganic chemical compounds are included on this HAP list. The EPA noted in the ANPR for the off-site waste and recovery operations source category its intent to regulate under this NESHAP only organic compounds which have been listed as HAP (58 FR 66337).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EPA decided not to regulate under the off-site waste and recovery operations NESHAP proposed today emissions of the metals and other inorganic chemical compounds listed as HAP. The primary source of inorganic HAP emissions from off-site waste and recovery operations is combustion units such as waste incinerators and boilers and industrial furnaces burning wastes or recoverable materials for energy. As explained in section II.D.1 of this notice, the EPA is addressing HAP emissions from these combustion sources under separate regulatory actions. Furthermore, the data available to the EPA do not suggest that significant quantities of inorganic HAP are emitted to the air from the off-site waste and recovery operations that would be subject to this NESHAP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Many different types of organic HAP potentially can be emitted from off-site waste and recovery operations facilities because of the wide variety of manufacturing processes and other sources which generate the materials sent to these facilities. Selection of the specific organic HAP chemicals for regulation under the off-site waste and recovery operations NESHAP is explained further in section IV.A of this notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Facility Types  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Off-site waste and recovery operations are conducted at many different types of facilities. Some of these facility types are listed as a specific NESHAP source category. The off-site waste and recovery operations source category is intended to represent all of the other facilities where off-waste and recovery operations are conducted but are not specifically included under another NESHAP source category. Based on this premise, the EPA identified the following types of facilities described below to be included (but not limited to) in the off-site waste and recovery operations source category.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Hazardous Waste TSDF  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the RCRA rules regulating the management of wastes determined to be hazardous waste, the EPA has established a permit system for owners and operators of facilities where operations are conducted to treat, store, or dispose of a RCRA hazardous waste. A facility subject to RCRA permitting requirements is termed a treatment, storage, and disposal facility (TSDF). A RCRA hazardous waste may be generated on the same site where a TSDF is located, or may be generated at one site and then transported to a TSDF at a separate location. Wastes not designated as RCRA hazardous waste are also managed at some TSDF. Although a waste may not specifically designated as a RCRA hazardous waste, this waste can still contain significant quantities of organic constitutes listed as HAP under the CAA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EPA has conducted nationwide surveys to collect information regarding hazardous waste management practices. Data from the most recent surveys indicate that approximately 2,300 TSDF were operating in the United States in 1986. At 710 of these TSDF, owners and operators reported managing RCRA hazardous wastes that are generated off-site. The EPA survey data indicate that approximately 240 of the 710 TSDF that receive waste from off-site also manage wastes other than RCRA hazardous waste.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Industrial Waste Landfill Facilities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Many landfill facilities throughout the Unites States are dedicated to the disposal of solid wastes other than those defined as RCRA hazardous wastes. Landfills accepting household wastes are defined under RCRA rules to be municipal solid waste (MSW) landfill units. No MSW landfill units are included in the off-site waste and recovery operations source category because these units are listed as a separate NESHAP source category. However, some other landfills are operated by waste management companies that will accept only industrial nonhazardous wastes (i.e., these landfills do not accept any household waste or RCRA hazardous waste).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

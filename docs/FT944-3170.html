			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Meeting of minds on prospects for Milan bourse A meeting of minds at Morgan Stanley and SG Warburg produced parallel recommendations for the recently belaboured Italian equity market, writes Our Markets Staff. Mr Richard Davidson, European strategist for Morgan Stanley, lifted Italian exposure from 4.5 to 7.5 per cent in his European model portfolio, and cut Germany's from 11.5 to an underweight 8.5 per cent. Italian politics were fully discounted in current share prices, said Mr Davidson, adding that an undervalued currency, good profits growth, an underpriced stock market and some of the country's best ever economic fundamentals were being overlooked. Germany's 1995 profits growth, he said, was discounted in a prospective p/e of 19.8, against Italy's 15 1/2 , and a price/cash flow multiple of 4.8 against 3.3; the economy was in good shape but interest rates were set to rise next year. Meanwhile, Mr Andrew Garthwaite at SG Warburg reiterated his recommendation for Italy, saying it remained, with France, one of his two favourite markets in continental Europe. He said that on a two-year view, investors risked underestimating earnings recovery in Italy. FRANKFURT recovered most of Monday's post-bourse losses. While the Dax index showed a fall of 13.57 to 2,011.25 on the session, the Ibis-indicated level rose 15.49 to 2,019.13 by the end of the afternoon. Turnover rose from DM4.1bn to DM4.8bn. There were useful recoveries by Allianz and Deutsche Bank in financials, but sentiment was lifted more by progress reports from Conti, the tyremaker, which rose DM5.40 to DM219.40; and Degussa, the chemicals and metals group, up another DM4.50 to DM432. Other industrials to do well included MAN, Preussag and Siemens. In the service sector, Karstadt, the department stores group, dropped DM5.60 to DM540 after German retail sales fell again; but Lufthansa rose DM4.80 to DM190.30 as a buy note for the airline coincided with technical factors. MILAN staged a technical bounce after sharp falls in recent sessions. The Comit index registered a loss of 4.55 at 581.64, but the real-time Mibtel index picked up 171 or 1.9 per cent to 9,436, reflecting late short-covering ahead of today's close of the monthly account. News that opposition parties had withdrawn amendments to speed the budget through parliament were viewed as a positive sign, as was a growing acceptance that the present coalition's days were numbered and that an end might soon be in sight to the increasingly acrimonious political crisis. However, the mood remained nervous as investors awaited the outcome of the prime minister's questioning by Milan magistrates in connection with alleged corruption. Among the blue chips, Fiat rose L106 or 1.9 per cent to L5,496, Generali rebounded L865 or 2.5 per cent to L35,305 and Olivetti was L64 or 3.4 per cent higher at L1,864. PARIS lost early ground, and then recovered in line with Wall Street. The CAC-40 index was off 2.21 at 1,917.11, after a high for the session of 1,921 and a low of 1,903. Turnover remained modest, at FFr3bn. In an assessment of the decision by Mr Jacques Delors not to contest next year's pres-idential election, James Capel noted that the effect on financial markets was likely to be negative. One of the reasons, it said, was because a Balladur/Delors duel had already been factored in, 'and the markets knew what to expect in terms of policy, whatever the outcome'. AGF, the insurance group, followed the trend of the sector  - the sub-index slipped 2.40 to 1,068.72  - with a loss of FFr4 to FFr220 bringing its fall from the start of the year to some 40 per cent. In common with other finance companies, AGF has been affected by poor results, exposure to a weak property sector and losses on its bond portfolio. Elsewhere among financials, SocGen dipped FFr3 to FFr595, Bancaire FFr1 to FFr543 and Paribas FFr3.40 to FFr375.80. ZURICH made little progress in quiet conditions, although some selective demand emerged for blue chips in the wake of the day's US economic data. The SMI index finished 3.2 higher at 2,566.0. UBS bearers fell a further SFr13 to SFr1,071 amid reports that one US broker had said that the stock could fall by another 10 per cent. MADRID revived in the afternoon and recovered some of its morning losses, cheered by gains on Wall Street and by US retail sales and producer prices data. The general index was finally off 0.46 at 299.72 in turnover of Pta25bn, with an active Tabacalera, a strong performer in recent months, down Pta165 at Pta3,590. BRUSSELS, with the Bel-20 index down 4.12 at 1,380.33, featured a fall of BFr15 to BFr2,480, after BFr2,465, in Union Miniere, which postponed a planned Swedish stock market flotation of its Swedish mine unit. UM was also weighed down by tomorrow's expiry of warrants to buy the parent's shares at BFr2,450. The warrants fell BFr13 to BFr23. STOCKHOLM was led higher by Ericsson as the Affarsvarlden General index closed 12.80 stronger at 1,467.90. The telecoms group landed a major order and the 'B' shares rose SKr12.50 to SKr407.50 on the signing of a framework agreement with the Spanish group Telefonica worth SKr4bn to SKr5bn over the next three years. Other heavyweights followed suit, with Astra 'A' and Pharmacia each up SKr2 to SKr195 and SKr115.50 respectively, Electrolux SKr4 better at SKr373 and Skanska ahead SKr2.50 at SKr168. OSLO closed lower in thin trading, overshadowed by the announcement of the death of the bourse president Mr Erik Jarve a day after his dismissal for alleged financial irregularities. Mr Jarve was widely regarded as the public face of the bourse for two decades, The all-share index was down 2.25 at 623.14 in very low turnover of NKr185m.

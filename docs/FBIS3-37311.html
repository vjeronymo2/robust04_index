			<p>Language: <F P=105> Georgian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Excerpt" from interview with Georgian Head of State Eduard </F> Shevardnadze by Russian Independent TV Company correspondent  Nona Andiashvili in Tbilisi on 15 February, conducted in Russian  -- recorded]    [Text] [Andiashvili] The Georgian Government issued a  statement in the wake of the events which started on 7 February  in Abkhazia. The statement says that although the Georgian  government supports a peaceful settlement of the conflict, it  will take all necessary measures to protect the Georgian  population on the territory occupied by the Abkhaz separatists.  Does this mean that the Georgian side is ready to start  hostilities against Abkhazia?    [Shevardnadze] First of all, I would like to take this  opportunity to say that we expected a more substantive reaction  from the relevant Russian authorities, which were well informed  about this tragedy. There has not been a single statement, not  a single protest, not a single address condemning this.    I do not want Russia's television representatives to feel  offended, but the information which was sent to them through  official channels was not conveyed to the public.    I think that in this way it will be difficult for us to join  efforts to solve the conflict peacefully. It is especially  upsetting that all these dramatic events happened after a very  successful visit to Georgia by Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin.    As for the part of the Georgian government's statement which  you mentioned, I think that if we fail to deploy peacekeeping  forces in the near future -- it does not matter how it happens  and what proportions it takes -- this will happen spontaneously.  We are finding it extremely difficult to restrain people, tens  of thousands of people [words indistinct], a great number of  weapons on the border in Zugdidi rayon and in other rayons  adjacent to Abkhazia.    We are told openly: If you are not able to defend us, we  will try to determine our fate ourselves.    I am afraid that everything will happen spontaneously and  then it will be too late to speak about a peaceful settlement  [words indistinct]]. We are naturally pinning high hopes on a  Security Council resolution. A Security Council meeting will  probably be held after the 20th. As regards the Security  Council, Russia has, I would say, a sensible position there.    In principle, we determined our (?common) attitude during  the  visit to Tbilisi by Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin.    If this issue [sending peacekeepers to Georgia] is decided,  then hope for a peaceful settlement remains.</p>

			<p><P> June 14, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE HOME COOK: ADDING A LITTLE SPICE TO OLD-TIME SPANISH RICE  </P> <P> Revising an old American cookbook can be a greater responsibility than anyone  imagines. Consider, for example, the case of Spanish rice.  </P> <P> Spanish rice was often found in American cookbooks of the mid-1800s; so, for  that matter, were Indian curries. The recipes were almost always very mild  versions of the originals, with only a dab of pepper or curry to enliven them.  </P> <P> The Fannie Farmer Cookbook was no exception. When I was revising the 11th  edition, I found that the recipe had the "blahs." Now, the first rule of  revision is always that the dish must taste good. After that decisions are made  as to ease of preparation, availability of ingredients and keeping the  character of the original author's intent. There really was a Fannie Merritt  Farmer, who published her first edition in 1896. I kept all that in mind when I  modernized the Spanish rice recipe, but I gave it lots more flavor.  </P> <P> I have just finished my second revision. And I took another look at Spanish  rice. It is, after all, a classic of an era when American dishes were innocent,  homey and pure. I have puzzled over what should be preserved, but I haven't  quite resolved the question. I finally turned the manuscript in, leaving the  last version of Spanish rice intact.  </P> <P> On the horns of this dilemma I turned to one of my favorite early American  authors, Sarah Tyson Rorer, and her book, "Mrs. Rorer's New Cookbook,"  published in 1902. Sarah Tyson was a fire-brand -- spirited, starchy and very  opinionated. She had a far-reaching sense of food and during her time wrote 24  popular cookbooks. She was preoccupied with how fast different foods were  digested, and carried on a campaign in favor of rice, her favorite because of  its quick digestion time. At the same time she railed against America's love of  pork, which took five hours to digest. "Life," she used to advise her audiences  "is too short to spend in digesting pork."  </P> <P> Rorer was highly respected for her tasty recipes, and when I turned to her  Spanish rice recipe and tested it, she did not disappoint me. It is very, very  good. She did not give amounts, but she did write at the end of the recipe, "if  this dish is properly cooked and highly seasoned, this is a very delicious  dish."  </P> <P> And it is. I wish I could use this adaptation of Rorer's recipe in my latest  revision, but Tyson and Merritt were competitors, and Fannie Merritt would  surely turn over in her grave.  </P> <P> SARA TYSON RORER'S SPANISH RICE  </P> <P> 2 1/2 cups water  </P> <P> 1 1/2 cups tomatoes with juice, broken up  </P> <P> 3 1/2 pounds chicken pieces (thighs, legs and breast)  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon red pepper flakes  </P> <P> 2 cups chopped onions  </P> <P> Salt, pepper  </P> <P> 1 cup chopped parsley  </P> <P> 1 cup long-grain rice  </P> <P> Combine water, tomatoes with juice, chicken pieces, red pepper flakes and  onions in heavy-bottomed pot with lid. Season to taste with salt and pepper.  Bring to boil, cover and simmer. Let simmer 20 minutes, turn chicken pieces  over. Add more tomato juice or water if liquid evaporates too much.  </P> <P> Add parsley and rice. Stir to mix well. Cover and simmer about 15 minutes  longer, checking once or twice to make sure liquid hasn't all been absorbed by  rice (add more liquid if needed). Adjust to taste with salt and pepper. Serve  hot. Makes 4 servings.  </P> <P> FANNIE FARMER'S SPANISH RICE  </P> <P> 1/4 cup olive oil  </P> <P> 1 onion, chopped  </P> <P> 1 small green pepper, chopped  </P> <P> 2 cloves garlic, minced  </P> <P> 1 stalk celery, diced  </P> <P> 1 cup chopped mushrooms  </P> <P> 4 large tomatoes, peeled and chopped  </P> <P> 1 cup long-grain rice  </P> <P> 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper  </P> <P> Salt  </P> <P> 2 cups chicken broth  </P> <P> Lightly oil 2-quart casserole. Heat olive oil in skillet over medium-low heat.  Add onion, green pepper, garlic, celery and mushrooms. Cook 5 minutes, stirring  often. Transfer to casserole and add tomatoes, rice and pepper. Season to taste  with salt. Stir in chicken broth. Cover and bake at 375 degrees 30 minutes.  Stir again and bake another 30 minutes. Makes 4 servings.  </P></p>

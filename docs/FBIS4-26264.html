			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] On 15 June the State Council Information Office  [SCIO], the United Front Work Department [UFWP] of the CPC  Central Committee,the State Nationalities Affairs Commission  [SNAC], and the Ministry of Culture jointly sponsored a victory  meeting for the Tibetan Art Troupe that just returned home  triumphantly from its maiden international tour.    Present at the meeting were State Councillor Ismail Amat;  SCIO director Zeng Jianhui; Tudao Doje, vice minister of the  SNAC;, Liu Deyou, vice minister of culture; and Li Dek Su,  deputy director of the UFWP.    Leaders of the four units delivered ebullient congratulatory  speeches at the meeting. They fully affirmed the art troupe's  first, immensely successful international tour. They believed  that the art troupe not only triumphantly accomplished its tour  but also displayed with flying colors the graceful bearing of  Tibet. Its repertoire, filled with the characteristics of  Tibetan culture and artistic charm, shook Austria and Sweden.  It demonstrated to the world that the magnificent Tibetan  culture is fully protected and flourishing in the vast territory  of the motherland, exposing with facts the rumors spread by  splittist forces abroad and enabling more people to gain a  correct understanding of Tibet.

			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / Inmos venture with HK company will save jobs INMOS, the UK-based semi-conductor company, is forming a new company with QPL International Holdings, a Hong Kong-based electronic components maker, which will enable it to keep open its south Wales factory and save 220 jobs. The new company, Newport Wafer Fab, will be 70 per cent owned by QPL and 30 per cent by Inmos, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of SGS-Thomson, the Franco-Italian semiconductor group. The Welsh Office is providing regional selective assistance. In addition, QPL expects to create 280 jobs over the next three years by upgrading the facility, and more than treble annual output at Newport by 1996. QPL will offer semiconductor foundry services to companies that design semiconductors but do not own a manufacturing facility. The company has foundries in the US and in Japan. The deal shows the growth of Far Eastern companies in electronics. QPL, a subcontractor of Inmos and SGS-Thomson, has raised turnover by 44 per cent to more than HKDollars 1bn (Pounds 85.6m), with profits in excess of HKDollars 171m.</p>

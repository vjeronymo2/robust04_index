			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / Down-to-earth member of the club: Two of a kind - Industrialists with different perspectives but similar aims for Europe Sir Patrick Sheehy, the chairman of BAT Industries, is a plain-man's European, a dispenser of common European home truths. The head of the UK-based tobacco and financial services group is a frequent speaker at high-flying European conferences. Yet he looks more at home in a golf club than the debating chamber. In his office overlooking the spires of Westminster, Sir Patrick spells out with inelegant forcefulness his desired way forward across the continent's undulating terrain. A firm believer in European integration, Sir Patrick, 62 years old - 43 of them spent with BAT - favours ratifying the Maastricht treaty. 'Let's stop the bickering and get Europe to work.' But he has no illusions about where the treaty will lead. 'I think the Maastricht treaty will be largely renegotiated in the next negotiations in 1996. I don't think very much in the treaty will be implemented between now and that time.' With ruddy cheeks and a rasping chuckle, Sir Patrick presides over one of Britain's truly global companies. He was born in Burma, started his business life in Nigeria, Ethiopia and Jamaica, speaks good French and passable Spanish and Dutch. He organises annual Anglo-French conferences. 'I wouldn't feel uncomfortable if my wife said: 'Let's retire to Italy or Spain.' ' He is more than a businessman: he spent a year preparing a government-commissioned report, just published, recommending fixed-term contracts and performance-related pay for British policemen. He is, however, no pious grandee. His vision is uncluttered. His goals - free trade, productivity, prosperity - are straightforward. And his language is devoid of anything approaching romanticism. 'BAT has done a great deal of (European) integration. But we haven't reached the high point. We have fewer factories today in Europe than before. I would imagine that in the next 10 years we would have even fewer. If we had a single currency, we would have a greater certainty of long-term costs, we would get better productivity in larger units.' Sir Patrick is the UK board member of the Association for Monetary Union in Europe, a group of experts and businessmen promoting economic and monetary union. But he sees little prospect that it will happen in the next few years. 'I don't think that we (Europe) will meet the target for a single currency by 1999. I don't think the Germans really want it. The Danish prime minister told me this the other day.' Sir Patrick, a member of the Round Table of European businessmen, believes in a European business culture. 'If you sat in an American culture, you'd find a different way of doing things.' He swaps information on salaries with other European chairmen. Earning nearly Pounds 1m last year, does Sir Patrick consider himself greedy? 'No I don't. It's a competitive salary for the job, certainly in European terms.' What does he do with the money? 'One of the things I always feel is, if I spent an hour and a half a day on my own affairs, I might be a much more wealthy person. I leave it to somebody else to manage. I give broad guidelines as to how I want the risk spread.' Long-term desire to spread risk, Sir Patrick believes, is the reason why Britain must remain interested in Emu. 'I cannot conceive of Britain, which has this huge financial services industry, not being in a single European currency, when all the other 11 are.' Sir Patrick supports an early British return to the exchange rate mechanism. 'The sooner we can get back and have currency stability, the better. I don't feel happier or wealthier, nor do our shareholders, with the fact that we've devalued by 20 per cent . . . There's a good case for having a currency that would hold its value. That's what I learnt at school, that money is meant to be a store of value.' Deeper western integration is being postponed, but Sir Patrick believes the EC should press on with eastward expansion. He enthuses about the 'long-term eastern promise' in BAT's joint ventures with the former Soviet bloc. 'We made profits in our first year in Hungary - it was not expected.' As part of efforts to forge stronger eastern links, he believes the EC should liberalise trade with eastern Europe. 'I think it's deplorable that we are being so restrictive.' Western Europe's lack of generosity towards its eastern neighbours illustrates, he says, a tendency to 'beggar my neighbour policies' among European governments. Protectionist tendencies are one reason why Sir Patrick professes no great admiration for EC politicians, whom he labels as 'out of touch'. He was pleased however at the change of prime minister in the UK. John Major, he says, 'prefers to be a member of the (European) club'. People such as Baroness Thatcher, says Sir Patrick, tend to exacerbate the cultural gap between Britain and other EC countries. 'The cultural thing is there - yes, and it's fed by jingoist politicians, if you like.' Is Lady Thatcher a jingoist? 'Yes, she's a little Englander, if that's the definition of a jingoist. She keeps on talking about how we have an alternative of being a strong partner - economic, politically and militarily  -of the US. Sir Patrick's view is more down to earth. 'My perception in America is that they believe Britain is an offshore island on the continent. We make ourselves out to be much more important to the Americans than we actually are.' This is the first in an occasional series on EC personalities. Next week: secret service chiefs</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Zheng Lingqiao [6774 7227 1564]] </F>   [Summary] The Ministry of Public Health reported recently  that disease incidence of epidemic hemorrhagic fever (EHF) is  rising in some areas of China and urged the local government to  pay closer attention to the matter. According to the report,  from January to October in 1993, although the disease incidence  and death toll dropped 11.14 percent and 43.48 percent  respectively from the same period of 1992, disease incidence in  some local areas in Anhui, Sichuan, and Shandong Provinces rose  rapidly and even caused some deaths since October of 1993.  Reports submitted by 40 EHF monitoring stations across the  country also affirmed the rapid increase of EHF disease  incidence since last October. Wild rats are believed to be the  major vectors of disease transmission, because the density of  wild rats in some rural areas is as high as 30-40 percent, and  15 percent in residential areas. Apodemus agrarius,  which accounts for 80-90 percent of wild rat population, is the  major intermediate host. In 1993, higher virus-carrying rate and  infection index of Apodemus agrarius have also been  reported.</p>

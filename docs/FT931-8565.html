			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / International Company News: Six Japanese companies brought into Thainox Steel venture THAINOX Steel, the Thai stainless steel joint venture in which Ugine of France is the largest foreign shareholder, yesterday announced that a consortium of six Japanese companies had been brought into the project. ILVA of Italy was brought into the venture last year. The latest move is the final stage in a restructuring of Thainox's equity, which began when several international steel producers found themselves planning rival factories with a combined capacity far too large for the Thai market. Under the final arrangement, Ugine will have 21 per cent of Thainox while ILVA and the Japanese consortium will hold 14 per cent each. The four Thai partners will share the remaining 51 per cent. Ugine and its partner, PM Group of Thailand, will retain joint management and operational control. Nippon Steel will co-ordinate the Japanese consortium, which says it will have the right to supply 30 per cent of the raw material for the plant in Rayong and to sell 30 per cent of Thainox's output to the Japanese companies' traditional customers in Thailand. The factory is due to start production in October this year of up to 60,000 tonnes a year of cold-rolled stainless steel sheets, an amount slightly higher than the present size of the entire Thai market. The sheets are used to make a range of products, including washing machines and car exhaust systems. Thainox says its plant will be the first producing stainless steel in the six-country Association of South East Asian Nations (Asean), where demand is growing at more than 10 per cent a year. The other Japanese participants are Nisshin Steel, Kawasaki Steel, Sumitomo Metal Industries, Nippon Metal Industry and Nippon Yakin Kogyo.</p>

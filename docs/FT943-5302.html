			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / Arts: Today's Television We must be heading for Christmas: BBC2's autumn season starts today. Between 5.30 and 8.50 the network offers four new series and the first episode in a complete re-run of The World At War, made at a cost of Pounds 1m by Thames TV and first shown by ITV in 1973. It is a pity that Laurence Olivier, at the best of times a bit of a ham, was so frustrated at not being seen that he turned his reading of the commentary into a sequence of rococo sound bites. Instead of being unnoticeable the narration is often horribly intrusive. Otherwise these are exemplary programmes: 26 one-hour episodes telling the story of the second world war (7.00). Italy Means Business is the first of five programmes about how they do things in the land of Bugatti and Gabrielli, starting at the odd time of 5.30. Murphy Brown is the pilot episode of a hugely successful American comedy starring Candice Bergen as the anchor woman of a television news programme (6.00). Fresh Prince Of Bel Air is the fourth series of another American comedy (6.25). And White Heat is the first in a series charting man's relationship with technology (8.00).</p>

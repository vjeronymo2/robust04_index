			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Lm"-signed article: "On the Difficult Path Toward the </F> Goal"]    [Text] Understandably it is the prime minister who has the  broadest powers. He has a far from unsubstantial influence on  the policies of the individual department ministers, though in  most cases it is only the departmental ministers themselves who  are judged on these policies.    In the past five years international relations (not to be  confused with foreign policy), the broad lines of financial  policy through the Treasury Ministry, and media and culture were  the direct responsibility of the head of government.    Strengthening Luxembourg's position with regard to the new  orientation of the European Union has understandably been a  constant theme in recent years.    With regard to the single internal market, as of 1 January  1992 the country was certainly able to take advantage of the EC  presidency in the first half of 1991, Prime Minister Jacques  Santer believes not without pride. In particular it was able to  fashion the harmonization of tax and excises in such a way as  not to damage Luxembourg's competitive position vis-a-vis its  partners.    Naturally, a mechanical effect on national price development  could not be excluded, he admits, but the key thing is that it  proved possible to maintain an advantage toward neighboring  countries.    When it comes to "monetary union," the prime minister points  out, it has been possible to keep the Belgian-Luxembourg franc  within the hard currency group. The Luxembourg Monetary  Institute [IML] has been expanded with a view to the transition  to phase three. He is "very pleased" that, despite many  difficulties, our country has been able to stick to all the  convergence criteria, and that right now it is the only country  which still fulfills these.    To carry out the governmental work more effectively, the  government declaration included a draft bill on the reform of  the Audit Office. For a long time, however, this topic was  gradually forgotten, and it was not until a few weeks ago that a  bill to this effect was submitted by CSV [Christian Social  People's Party] representative Francois Colling as president of  the Finance Committee. Santer nonetheless energetically refutes  any government responsibility in the bill's delay.    The Audit Office is a body which is at the disposal of the  Parliament, which is responsible for its restructuring in  cooperation, of course, with the government, given that this  action also requires the reform of government accounting. Here  the preparatory work has been largely concluded, so that both  reforms can now to carried through in parallel.    Luxembourg, which proudly sees its place confirmed as the  world's seventh largest financial marketplace, has been very  concerned in recent years to improve its supervisory activities,  so as to prevent abuse, money laundering and insider offenses.  The bursting of the BCCI [Bank of Credit and Commerce  International] scandal into the midst of these efforts, should  not, in Santer's view, be overvalued. This scandal clearly did  not originate in Luxembourg. Nor should one be under any  illusion that laws provide absolute protection against scandals.    Overall supervision has been notably increased in recent  years not only by the transposition of all the EU directives,  but also through the expansion of the IML, the law against tax  evasion and on legal aid. This has confirmed the seriousness of  the banking market, which has also been reflected in  international assessments.    Not without pride Santer also points to the fact that it was  the Luxembourg authorities which succeeded in bringing to  justice one of the largest international drug dealers in the  person of Franklin Jurado.    The second field with which Jacques Santer identifies  himself  (also personally), is the media sector, in which in 1989 people  were optimistically expecting a renewal of the licence with CLT  [Luxembourg Line Broadcasting Company]. In the meantime the  negotiations ran aground.    "Over the last two months" the prime minister has "become  optimistic again," though pointing out in the same breath that,  given the deadline of 1 January 1996, there is no urgency.  Reaching an accord will be "one of the new government's first  jobs."    One of the most controversial draft bills of the past  legislative period was the liberalization of the national media.  Santer does not consider the fact that the initial euphoria has  givewn way to a large extent to a more sober approach as a  failure of this project. Completely new paths have been taken.  Difficulties will always be there. It is the same in every  country.    The standards which the government has set provide the  starting conditions: it is now up to the individual radio  stations to fight it out. For Santer, the same applies also to  sociocultural radio. He does not want to exclude the possibility  that many changes could still occur. For him, this is normal.</p>

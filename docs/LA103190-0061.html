			<p><P> October 31, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> ANALYSIS;  </P> <P> GETTING TO PLAYOFFS WON'T BE EASY FOR CHARGERS;  </P> <P> GRADUATING TO PLAYOFFS WON'T BE EASY  </P> <P> Coach Dan Henning said Tuesday that "it's feasible" for the Chargers to be in  the playoffs this season.  </P> <P> He did not say if he also has been advised privately that the rest of the  country will soon be overrun by killer bees.  </P> <P> The Chargers are 3-5 on this Halloween, and unless they are allowed to dress in  costume as the San Francisco 49ers for the rest of the season, do you really  think they have the look of playoff contenders?  </P> <P> "It's feasible," Henning said. "We have to stay at the top of the pack of the  18 teams that started off last week with three wins or less."  </P> <P> You can see how long it has been since the Chargers made it to the playoffs.  They don't even have a grasp of the rules on what it takes to get there.  </P> <P> There are only 14 teams in the American Football Conference, and every team in  the NFC could finish with a worse record than Henning's Chargers, and it  wouldn't make any difference.  </P> <P> The top six teams in the AFC will advance to the playoffs, and presently there  are nine teams in the AFC with a better mark than the Chargers.  </P> <P> "We have to win, we have to continue to win to stay in there," Henning said.  </P> <P> Now how feasible is that?  </P> <P> What happened to the fifth-place schedule that was going to make the Chargers  fat and sassy this season? What happened to the defense that was going to buy  time for a developing offense? What happened to Bobby Beathard?  </P> <P> At the midway mark of the season, the Chargers have compiled three victories.  And these victories have come against the 2-6 Browns, the 3-5 Jets, and the 4-4  Bucs, who traveled across America without their starting quarterback.  </P> <P> In making their stretch run, the Chargers will play four games at home and four  on the road. They will take on foes with a combined mark of 19-17. And yes,  they get to play the Jets again.  </P> <P> But before ordering those playoff tickets, a midterm report card:  </P> <P> QUARTERBACK: C  </P> <P> Putting the ball in Billy Joe Tolliver's hands is like giving the family car to  the teen-ager on Friday night. Now whether you're sitting in the stands or  staying up all night, it's nerve-racking. At times it looks like Tolliver  couldn't hit the Pacific Ocean if he threw from the Pacific Beach pier, but  check his pulse, he's now thrown 70 passes in a row without an interception.  He's tough, he's a leader, and boo all you want, he's a survivor . . . Mark  Vlasic has a career mark of 2-1 as an NFL starter, and the head coach who won't  let him play has an  </P> <P> overall record of 31-56-1.  </P> <P> RUNNING BACK: A+  </P> <P> Want to make a quick buck: Take a weekend flight to Miami or Green Bay or  Minneapolis and stop by the local pubs and wager football fans that they can't  tell you who leads the NFL in rushing. If Marion Butts duplicates his 654-yard  performance in second half of the season, he will shatter the Chargers'  all-time rushing mark of 1,179 yards set by Earnest Jackson in 1984. If  Chargers' coaching staff hadn't been bullied into getting the ball to Rod  Bernstine, Butts might already have topped the 1,000-yard mark. Versatile  Ronnie Harmon provides brass with more weapons than they know what to do with  -- and isn't that the truth.  </P> <P> RECEIVERS: C-  </P> <P> They can find a tight end to play running back and a kicker who can't miss, but  they can't find a qualified pass catcher to start opposite Anthony Miller. If  Miller is drawing double coverage all the time, then how bad are these other  guys? Miller has 33 receptions and the rest of the wide receivers have a total  of 19. How about a Charlie Joiner comeback? In hindsight, the training camp  knee injury to speedy Wayne Walker may have been the team's most devastating  loss. In lacking such production from the wide receivers, why not employ the  pass-catching skills of Bernstine, Darrin Nelson and Harmon more often? A few  more passes to the running backs would also increase Tolliver's completion  percentage and improve his confidence.  </P> <P> OFFENSIVE LINE: B  </P> <P> It's like Robert Redford in "The Natural." You have this just  horrible/terrible/awful group of stiffs and then just the right guy wanders  along, and voila, they start playing like Hall of Famers. In this case, that  would be offensive line coach Alex Gibbs, and while no one will ever mistake  him for Reynolds or Redford, Ripley's should take notice. Chargers not only  average 4.6 yards a run behind these so-called slugs, but in eight games, the  team's quarterbacks have been sacked only 11 times. That's with Eric Floyd and  Leo Goeas alternating at left tackle. Makes you wonder if Gibbs has some pact  with the devil.  </P> <P> DEFENSIVE LINE: C-  </P> <P> What was to be the team's biggest strength has been the biggest bust. In three  victories, the defensive line had 10 sacks; in five defeats, it had 10. As the  pass rush goes, so goes the Chargers' defense. The loss of Joe Phillips was  like Padres' midseason loss of Benito Santiago. But then playing Lee Williams  at defensive tackle is like asking Tony Gwynn to bat only against left-handers.  Makes no sense. Williams was one of the game's premier players as a defensive  end, but at defensive tackle he's been declawed. Burt Grossman is tied for the  AFC lead with eight sacks, but has lost his funny edge since being berated by  coaches for not playing well early on when he was hurt.  </P> <P> LINEBACKERS: C+  </P> <P> You got your Henry Rolling and you got your Junior Seau. You know, it's like a  record. On one side you got your big hit, "Johnny B. Goode," and on the flip  side you got your basic clunker. Rolling's not only been one of the biggest  surprises, but if you're having a sports banquet and you're looking for someone  to impress the youngsters, get ahold of this guy. Seau obviously has the talent  to be a great player, but he's turned more people off than he has on so far . .  . The leading tackler on this team for the fifth-straight season is Gary  Plummer, but then you knew that.  </P> <P> DEFENSIVE BACKS: B  </P> <P> Two things you probably never thought you'd see again in your lifetime: Rain  and a competent Charger secondary. Asking the Charger secondary to stay with  Louis Lipps, Al Toon, Ernest Givins, Willie Gault and Mervyn Fernandez is like  asking Woody Allen to keep up with Bo Derek. It boggles the imagination, but  did you know that the Chargers' secondary has allowed only three catches of 40  yards or more this season, and only one of those was for a touchdown. And  safety Vencie Glenn has been hurt in the early going. Gill Byrd leads the AFC  with five interceptions, Sam Seale has passed each test and Martin Bayless was  having a Pro Bowl year before injuring an ankle. Are those rain clouds over  yonder?  </P> <P> SPECIAL TEAMS: B+  </P> <P> The team's 3-5 record in the first half of the season is even more  disappointing when you consider the tremendous improvement made in special  teams. Get it right, stupid. And so they did. Initially, they kept Fuad Reveiz  over John Carney, but now Carney's back and eight for eight in field goals.  Punter John Kidd makes a genius again out of Beathard. Richard Brown and Steve  Hendrickson have brought enthusiasm back to pro sports, and special teams  coordinator Larry Pasquale has been the best thing to hit San Diego since Steve  Ortmayer left town.  </P> <P> COACHING: C-  </P> <P> You get rid of that fake punt in Dallas and the Chargers are 4-4. Some folks  would rather get rid of the guy who called for the fake punt, but another  continuity blip here and you're looking at the year 2000 before happy days are  here again. Yeah, yeah, Henning's stubborn, he's deadly dull and the way he  manages time on the sideline you have to figure he still doesn't know we're no  longer on daylight savings time. But he has a plan, and as he gathers the  personnel to make it work, you grudgingly come to the realization that he may  know what he's doing. In the past 10 games, the Chargers are 5-5 under Henning.  They'd be 6-4 if the numbskull hadn't called for the fake punt.  </P> <P> FRONT OFFICE: B+  </P> <P> The battle here is with expectations. OK, so the Chargers have won only 15 of  their past 46 games, but we're talking Bobby Beathard. Give him another month.  Five of his draft picks have already earned starting time as rookies. And a  sixth, quarterback John Friesz, is pegged as a potential starting quarterback  down the road. Two of his Plan B acquistions, Kidd and Harmon, have paid  sizeable dividends, and the signing of Rolling as a linebacker off the streets  is the kind of thing Beathard did in 1983 to take the Redskins to the Super  Bowl. Defense isn't as strong as he thought when he took the job, and so  rebuilding may take a little longer. So give him two months.  </P> <P> PREDICTION: 7-9  </P> <P> Killer bees fail to make it in time.  </P></p>

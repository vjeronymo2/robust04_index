			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / Arts: Loot On Press night, even after several previews, Peter James's production of Joe Orton's black comedy still looked like a beta-plus version of a straight-alpha play. That isn't such very faint praise; if you had never seen The Importance of Being Earnest, a goodish provincial staging might still be a revelatory delight, and so may this Loot be. Here, a scattering of small fluffs by the cast throughout the evening suggested under-rehearsal, but also an early prospect of tightening-up. The general Ortonesque tone was generally audible, which is to say that the James cast knew well enough that Orton's diction is the heart of the matter. Very few British plays this century have pulled themselves so completely into the words, mocking and subversive in a self-contained, consistently original vein. The casting is judicious, and the pacing deftly handled - some momentary lapses, but a strong forward impulse with a fine accelerando towards the end. On the other hand, the producer has devised cute freeze-frames to begin and end the acts, and saddled his murderous Nurse Fay (Dearbhla Molloy) with a mechanical bottom-wiggle from the start: winsome vaudeville, nothing to do with Orton. Ben Walden has been allowed and perhaps encouraged to play his personable Hal 'sincere', down to a carefully demotic accent that takes the edge off his best vicious lines. The preludial music - 'I Did It My Way' on crematorium-organ - is nice, but the bundled cadaver of Hal's Mum is ridiculously large and lightweight. Miss Molloy allows herself too much Irish crooning, melodious lubrication of lines that want scarifying down-to-earth candour. Colin Hurley captures Hal's pal Dennis, the criminal undertaker's-assistant, with cooler precision, though he is a bit over-age: it matters to the play that the appalling Hal and Dennis are just streetwise adolescents. Nobody but Patrick O'Connell's widowed McLeavy, baffled and beset, should speak with unguarded feeling; O'Connell does that very well, but the improper competition - from Hal and from Nurse Fay, and even from the egregious Truscott of the Yard - denies him his proper effect. When his last unjust deserts should jolt us beyond the provisional limits of the farce, they melt painlessly into the general charade. Inspector Truscott is the key role, and David Troughton plays him with resourceful relish: not a line wasted nor an implication missed, the transition from simple Agatha Christie bumbler to corrupt modern archetype smoothly managed. Yet Troughton's basic comic persona gets in the way. He is always vainly ingratiating, a hopeful wheedler, where the original West End Truscott (Michael Bates, much missed) went through virtuoso switches from flat Christie stereotype to sudden sadist - here, Troughton's duffing-up of Hal carries nothing like the shock-value - to venal bribee. That made Loot much nastier, and significantly funnier. Lyric, Hammersmith, to June 6</p>

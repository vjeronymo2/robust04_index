			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / UN troops killed in Somalia Three Pakistani United Nations peacemakers were burned to death when Somali militiamen blew up their armoured vehicle during a dawn battle in Mogadishu yesterday, Reuter reports from Mogadishu. Hours later, helicopter-borne US commandos captured Mr Osman Hassan Ali, main financial backer of General Mohamed Farah Aideed, the fugitive warlord, in what the UN termed a 'significant milestone' in its operations. A total of 53 peacekeepers - 31 of them Pakistanis - have been killed in 16 weeks of guerrilla war with Gen Aideed's followers.</p>

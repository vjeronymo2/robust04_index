			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Northumbrian Water buoyed by price rises - 14% advance despite unregulated business losses NORTHUMBRIAN Water, the smallest of the 10 privatised water companies, yesterday announced a 14 per cent increase in profits helped by price increases and acquisitions. But the company's unregulated business, seen as an important long-term profit source, suffered losses after interest costs and Mr David Cranston, chief executive, said the division's performance was 'disappointing'. Pre-tax profits increased from Pounds 61.1m to Pounds 69.4m, including Pounds 9.3m from an investment in a hedged equity fund. At the interim stage, profits were 25 per cent higher at Pounds 39.2m. Turnover increased 24 per cent to Pounds 252.1m, of which Pounds 13.2m came from acquisitions after average price rises of 10.3 per cent. Operating costs increased 23 per cent, leaving operating profits on continuing operations 22 per cent higher at Pounds 67.2m. Capital expenditure increased from Pounds 122.9m to Pounds 135.4m while the company moved from net cash of Pounds 6.1m a year ago to net borrowings of Pounds 102.8m. Included in the cash outflow were Pounds 24.6m of acquisition costs and Pounds 55.7m of investments in finance leases. Non-regulated businesses, which include waste management and environmental services, increased turnover by more than 40 per cent to Pounds 45.2m. Earnings increased 18 per cent to 100.7p per share. A recommended final dividend of 15p makes a total of 22.5p, an increase of 10 per cent. The shares fell 7p to 563p. COMMENT Poor results from Northumbrian's unregulated business were not surprising, nor unique in the water sector; but the company has been touted in the past as small enough to generate meaningful non-core profits. Losses after interest costs last year, with more expected this year, should therefore be seen as quite a setback, if only temporary. More immediately, with water companies facing Ofwat's periodic review, Northumbrian has a better immunity to regulatory challenge than some of its competitors, although its assumed K factor of 7.2 per cent looks optimistic. This year's profits should be helped by income from a financial engineering investment and are forecast at Pounds 78m, putting the shares on a multiple of 5. With the whole sector out of favour, the shares are unlikely to gain much ground.</p>

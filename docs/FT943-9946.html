			<p>940808 FT  08 AUG 94 / Emerging Markets: Assessing prospects for China's B-shares - The Emerging Investor While most attention focused last week on the astonishing surge in China's A-share markets for local investors, international fund managers and market analysts were quietly re-assessing prospects for B-shares for foreign investors. Securities' analysts expect that the B-share markets in Shanghai and Shenzen will continue to make their own pace and to firm for the rest of the year irrespective of what happens with A-shares. Shanghai's B-share index closed the week up just 4.6 per cent, compared with the extraordinary 104.55 per cent leap in A-shares following Beijing's declaration that new listings would be frozen this year. Mr Richard Graham of Baring Securities in Shanghai predicts that the B-share index will climb back by the end of the year to around 100 points, where it began 1994. It slid by some 40 points by the second quarter, before rebounding by 15 per cent since June. It ended last week at 74.40, up from 71.13 at the beginning of the week. 'It now looks much more positive,' said Mr Graham. 'I think the market will go back to 100 by the end of the year.' He noted that B shares were now trading at multiples of about ten times 1994 earnings, which made them 'inexpensive by any standards in an emerging market.' Securities analysts said a number of Shanghai manufacturing companies represented 'good value', but fortunes of the tiny Shanghai B-share market - just 24 stocks are listed and turnover is small - depended to an extent on sentiment in Hong Kong towards so-called H-shares. These are Hong Kong-listed mainland companies. A strengthening of H-shares in the past month had helped to revive interest in the Shanghai and Shenzen B-share markets. Other factors in the improving picture for B-shares included a decree issued by China's State Council, or cabinet, clearing the way for mainland Chinese living abroad and other categories of persons deemed appropriate to purchase B-shares. This 'deliciously vague' decree, as one Shanghai-based analyst described it, opened the way for mainland Chinese holding dollars to buy B-shares, either through relatives or friends overseas, or possibly directly through local securities houses. With an estimated Dollars 2.6bn (Pounds 1.67bn) on deposit in banks in Shanghai alone and with dollar deposit rates very low there would seem to be ample scope for local investment in the B-share market. A proposal by the China Securities Regulatory Commission that would enable foreign investors to buy A-shares through Sino-foreign joint venture securities companies is regarded as a positive development and one that would help to bring closer the prospect of unified A and B share markets. But representatives of international securities companies say this proposal is fraught with difficulties in the absence of an investment management law now in the draft stage. Foreigners could not be expected to invest in A-shares unless the conversion of funds out of the yuan could be guaranteed. Repatriation of funds abroad would also have to be protected. Removal, however, of the artificial distinction between the A and B share markets will have to await full currency convertibility. Chinese officials are vague about the possible timing of convertibility, beyond saying that it may happen 'within five years.' Among other positive developments for Shanghai B-shares was the recent clearance given by the ultra-cautious Japanese share dealer's association for investments in the Shanghai market. While this has not, as far as can be ascertained, been transformed into anything more than a dribble of buying orders, reports that the Japanese are on the way may have helped stabilise the market. Indications that Japanese securities houses may be turning their attention to 'China plays' have been accompanied by reports that a Japanese Dollars 1bn fund is being put together that would go 80 per cent to H-shares and 20 per cent to B-shares. But, like other skittish foreign investors, Japanese securities houses will approach investing in China's fledgling markets warily. It is most unlikely that last week's wild trading in A-shares will be repeated in the B-share market.

			<p>921130 FT  30 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: UK smaller companies Given the soggy performance of UK smaller companies in recent years, it takes a leap of faith to launch an investment trust designed to track the stock market's minnows. Hoare Govett's new venture, however, may not be quite as perverse as it seems. Smaller companies are particularly vulnerable to high interest rates partly because they are usually highly geared. As recession hits, they are also hurt because large companies try to improve their cash flow at the expense of the smaller fry. Both those pressures ease as interest rates fall. Historically the sector has offered high returns to compensate investors for the difficulty in dealing in the companies' shares. That changed in the mid-1980s, as small company shares were briefly perceived as more liquid. The 1987 stock market crash shattered this illusion. Now the sector has fallen back to allow the more traditional high return. Illiquidity, and hence this high return, may well continue: an investor in small company shares may often have advantageous information which his counterparty has not researched. Wide spreads are a defence against this information gap. Hoare Govett might argue that investors in its trust are protected from the liquidity problem. The trust will track its own Smaller Companies Index which has a beta of one, making it no more volatile than the market as a whole. It might thus seem a cheap way of obtaining high small company returns. That said, investors may prefer to wait and see what level of discount to net assets the fund settles at before taking the plunge.</p>

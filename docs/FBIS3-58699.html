Messr. Moraitis (agriculture),  Pangalos (deputy foreign minister, who will chair the General  Affairs Councils), Simitis (industry, trade, technology and  research), Romeos (secretary of state for the national economy),  Papantoniou (deputy minister for the national economy), Boutos  (governor of the bank of Greece), as well as Mrs. Melina  Mercouri (culture) and Mrs. Papazoi (secretary of state for the  environment, town and country planning and public works)  stressed the following elements:    1) General Affairs. Mr. Theodoros Pangalos spoke of the  following dossiers:    i) Community anti-racist policy: "It is very difficult to  legislate against" the phenomenon of racism and the far-right;    ii) Committee of the regions: The one country behind,  Portugal, has told Athens that the Portuguese delegation within  this body would be "ready by next week," which will enable the  Committee to hold its first meeting in January (but not, as  planned, 15 January);    iii) Partnership in Europe: Refusing to speak out on the  American plan which Mr. Clinton will be presenting to NATO, Mr.  Pangalos said that there had not yet been a debate on the  possible accession of Hungary and Poland to the Western European  Union. On two occasions, he will have contacts at different  levels in Hungary, and said that it was necessary to "think  along the lines of a variable geometry";    iv) Cyprus: The need to apply pressure on Turkey (which  "decides the Turkish Cypriot policy" whereas the majority of  people who voted in this part of the island "are settlers")  "remains as true as ever";    v) Former Yugoslavia: "The Community must not always let  itself be led into an action that leads to nothing," says Mr.  Pangalos, who will "soon" be meeting Merrs. Owen and Stoltenberg  in Geneva. And he stated: "There are limits to the European  commitment" if there are no positive responses on the part of  those engaged in the conflict;    2) Agriculture. Georges Moraitis said that his meeting on  Wednesday (at the meeting between the Greek Government and the  Commission) with Commissioner Steichen had essentially concerned  coordinating the necessary actions to tackle six problems.    i) Enlargement. It is up to the General Affairs Council to  conduct negotiations with the four candidate countries, but the  Agriculture Ministers cannot be left out of aspects that concern  them. Mr. Moraitis says that personally he believed that formal  consultation of the Agricultural Council would be a "good  initiative to avoid problems." For the time being, Athens is,  however, only thinking about bilateral discussions at  ministerial level, even should the Presidency try to make things  work so that the Agricultural Council "can give its opinion";    ii) Setting agricultural prices and connected measures for  1994-1995. The Commission will submit its proposal "toward the  end of January" and the debate begun at ministerial level at the  21/22 February Council;    iii) Follow-up to the elaboration of the final texts of  GATT. While the experts finalize the text of the Uruguay Round,  it will be up to the Agriculture Council to assure its  compatibility with the revised CAP;    iv) The revision of the common organisation of markets in  the following sectors:    \ a) wine (the Commission's final proposal toward the  mid-February and debate in Council from March onwards);    b) fats, fruits and vegetables (Commission proposal in  April, according to Mr. Steichen);    c) sugar (the Twelve have more time in this sector, the  current regulation having been prolonged and not needing  replacing before 1995);    v) The modification of the regulation relating to the  control by member states of measures funded by the EAGGF  [European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund] (Commission  proposal in February and beginning of ministerial discussions in  March);    vi) Relations between the EU [European Union] and East  Europe in agriculture, the Commission's proposals being expected  "toward the middle of the presidency." Asked about the  possibility of the EU deciding to reduce the controls by the  Twelve on agricultural exports from these countries, Georges  Moraitis said that this question (which is the subject of a  current study) would be "raised"; but it is "too early to say  what measures will be taken," the aim only being to "reestablish  a relationship which would allow for wider cooperation" with  these countries. At its own initiative, the Greek presidency  will also grant priority to two other dossiers, these are:    a) Promoting discussion on inter-professional  organisations. For Mr. Moraitis, there are today farmers  organisations and production cooperatives: it would be "very  useful to have mixed organisations too," which would "facilitate  the final decision at Community level for each product";    b) Employment of the new farmers and, through this,  questions of means of succession in farming. As the agricultural  population is ageing, "we must ease the integration of the  young" (which in particular poses the problem of the  transmission of quotas). According to Mr. Moraitis, the  Commissioner showed "great interest" in this question which, as  that of the inter-professional organisations, will be at the  centre of the 16/17 May informal meeting.    3. Ecofin. According to Georges Papantoniou, three  categories  of subjects will be studied by the Finance Ministers, these are.    i) Materialization of the white paper, the presidency being  resolved to take "all the initiatives required to promote it as  soon as possible" from three angles:    a) the policy of employment (in collaboration with the  Ministers for Employment);    b) improving the competitiveness of SMEs, subject for  which it has been agreed with Commissioner Vanni d'Archirafi  that the Internal Market Council would deal with on two  occasions on the basis of an action programme to be presented by  the Commission;    c) the realisation of the trans-European networks, Ecofin  having the "responsibility for financing them."    ii) the realisation of macro-economic policy, the Ecofin  Council having to discuss the Commission's annual report during  the Greek presidency and, in June, the major economic policy  guidelines (to be adopted at the Corfu Summit). The Twelve will  also learn of the convergence programmes for Denmark, Greece,  Ireland and Portugal. As for the 2nd phase of European Monetary  Union [EMU], Mr. Papantoniou said that he would soon visit to  the president of the European Monetary Institute in Frankfurt.  Speaking personally, he said that Mr. Lamfalussy would not be  called on to attend every Ecofin Council session, but rather be  invited "from time to time." As for the nature of the activities  to hand over to the European Monetary Institute [EMI] (narrow  definition or management of the common reserves), the Deputy  Minister for that National Economy said that Athens supported  full implementation of Maastricht, but that there were two other  parameters to take into account:    a) The first phase of EMU had not been a success, having  been characterized by a great "relaxing of the rules of monetary  cooperation" following the crisis of the European Monetary  System [EMS], which would make it "illogical to be particularly  ambitious for the second phase";    b) that fact that a member state regarded as premature  handing over the powers of monetary authority to the EMI,  considering that this "presupposed much too greater  convergence." Whence, the Greek presidency notes that "it is not  realistic to expect EMI to work immediately like a Central Bank  embryo." As for the 3rd phase of EMU, Mr. Papantoniou firmly  denied being ready to open the debate in order for the  Maastricht criteria to be relaxed. But Yannis Boutos said that,  personally, he feared a situation arising which would force one  to reconsider the criteria for convergence. As for the EMS,  Georges Papantoniou said it was "premature" and "of not much  use" to study its reinforcement under the Greek presidency, the  priority having to go to "considerable promoting cohesion before  thinking about reconstructing the previous EMS";    iii) Strengthening relations with East Europe, especially  in the light of choices to be made in the trans-European  networks.</p>

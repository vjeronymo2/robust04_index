			<p><P> May 19, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE PREPS;  </P> <P> SOUTHERN SECTION VOLLEYBALL PLAYOFFS;  </P> <P> LAGUNA BEACH GETS LEVELED BY SEA KINGS  </P> <P> There was no 'cruise' for the Corona del Mar High School boys' volleyball team  Thursday night in the Southern Section 4-A volleyball semifinals, but there was  near perfection.  </P> <P> The Sea Kings turned what was supposed to be a close match into a runaway at  Newport Harbor High School. They took second-seeded Laguna Beach out in three  games, 15-5, 15-7, 16-14, to advance to the championship match.  </P> <P> Corona del Mar (15-2) will play No. 1 seeded Mira Costa in the title game  Saturday at Marina High School. Mira Costa defeated Newport Harbor, 15-5, 15-2,  15-11, in Thursday's other semifinal at Corona del Mar High School.  </P> <P> Laguna Beach (19-2) had lost only 12 games all season. The Artist had beaten  just about every top team in Orange County, including Corona del Mar three  weeks ago.  </P> <P> In that match, the Sea Kings had won the first game and led, 12-5, in the  second only to lose in four games.  </P> <P> "We call that the 'Corona Cruise,' " middle blocker Jason Perkins said. "It  seems that every match we have a moment where just let down."  </P> <P> The Sea Kings had only a brief lapse Thursday, but Perkins quickly put an end  to it.  </P> <P> After winning the first two games without too much resistence, Corona del Mar  jumped to a 5-0 lead in the third game. However, behind the play of Dain  Blanton and Sean Stafford, the Artists rallied to tie the score, 6-6.  </P> <P> Perkins re-entered the match and provided three quick kills to stop Laguna  Beach's momentum.  </P> <P> "Jason has been our big-game player all season," Corona del mar Coach Charlie  Brande said. "He's picked us up in wins over Newport Harbor and University this  year. This game is all momentum and Jason provided it tonight."  </P> <P> Perkins had 16 kills, 10 of which came in the final game.  </P> <P> Laguna Beach managed to take a 14-13 lead at one point and had a chance to  prolong the match. However, the last of Matt Herrington's 12 kills gave the Sea  Kings service.  </P> <P> Herrington served three times, the last of which ended in Stafford missing on a  kill attempt to give Corona del Mar the match.  </P> <P> "The last time we played Laguna Beach, we were intimidated," Herrington said.  "We blew that one. We knew we could beat them and we wanted a little revenge."  </P> <P> Through the first games, the Sea Kings got it.  </P> <P> The Artists led, 3-2, in the first game, but watched as Corona del Mar ran off  seven consecutive points. Laguna Beach took a 4-0 in the second game, but the  Sea Kings again reeled off seven in a row.  </P> <P> Herrington and Matt Cwiertnia, who also had 12 kills, worked the outside in the  first two games. When the Artists adjusted, Perkins was able to score in the  middle.  </P> <P> "We got them down early and I don't think they knew how to handle it," Brande  said. "They're a well-coached team, but they're use to being ahead."  </P></p>

			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / Observer: Cavalier laughter The silly season is about to begin, at, of all places, the National Gallery. On Wednesday evenings throughout July, the gallery is staging what it is pleased to call 'Match of the Day'. Two paintings will be featured, and two members of staff will sing their respective praises. At the end, the audience votes to decide the winner. Expected result: Frans Hals's 'Young Man Holding a Skull', one: Sassoferrato's 'Virgin in Prayer', nil. Trouble from hooligans is not expected.</p>

This Was  How Viktor Yerin Described the Chief Task of the Russian  Ministry of Internal Affairs"]    [Text] The thesis that the accumulation of initial capital  has always been criminal everywhere has been proved by life.  You have only to look at the realities of our market existence  today: The pages of the daily papers are literally full of  reports of thefts, robberies, and shoot-outs.    In the past analysts predicted that individual criminal  groupings would start consolidating themselves, dividing up  spheres of influence, strengthening international ties, bribing  officials, and politicizing themselves. It is obvious now that  this phenomenon has outgrown the criminal framework and become a  real threat to the state's security, jeopardizing Russia's  political and economic development.    There is quite a lot of evidence of this. Thus, in the  opinion of specialists, economic elements are increasingly  frequently entering the sphere of interests of criminal  structures, and the credit and banking system is being  undermined. Between 70 and 80 percent of privatized enterprises  are already the victims of extortion, and most commercial banks  in the capital and in Russia are under the control of criminal  groupings.    Another aspect of the problem is the fact that organized  crime poses a threat to the already weak legal policy. I have  already spoken of the trend toward its politicization. This  means that criminal elements are being enabled to influence the  adoption of particular decrees and laws through corrupt  officials and politicians. Incidentally, during the first half  of last year alone employees of law-enforcement organs put a  stop to 8,800 official crimes, and 40 percent more instances of  bribery were also stopped. According to the analysts'  conclusions, the mafia's influence over the disposition of  political forces will increase.    These are the gloomy forecasts, and yet, according to the  official data of the Russian MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs],  although the crime situation remains complex and the growth of  crime is increasing, it is already possible to speak of a  reduction in the rate of growth. The clear-up rate for crimes,  including economic crimes, is also improving--which has made it  possible to return 1.688 trillion rubles to the state.    Army General Viktor Yerin cited these data in his report at  the all-Russia conference-seminar of leading personnel of  internal affairs and internal troop organs, which opened in  Moscow 8 February. The minister of internal affairs dwelt in  detail on the results of internal affairs organs' operational  service activity during 1993.    The minister named as particularly alarming trends the  growth  in the dynamics of serious criminal infringements, the increase  in drug trafficking, the growing scale of weapon thefts, and the  unprecedented rampant corruption.    As though confirming his words, news came of the 7 February  confiscation of 5.618 kg of dry opium from operators in the  drugs business by employees of the capital's Internal Affairs  Main Administration and the Russian MVD.    "We will not make progress along the path of reforms unless  we launch a determined offensive against crime," Viktor  Chernomyrdin, chairman of the Russian Government, emphasized in  his address to the conference. He reported that a federal  program to combat crime in Russia in 1994-1995 has been prepared  and will be adopted in the very near future. The head of  government particularly noted the importance of adopting a new  legislative base, as the previous one is obsolete and does not  meet the demands of the times.    Well, can the "beloved city" now sleep tight? For the news  is reassuring, you might say. But it is right here that a doubt  arises. For all this is already painfully familiar: to  "mount," "broaden," "deepen...." I recall how as long ago as  January last year the president announced the start of a  "frontal offensive against crime." The federal program for  combating crime was to have been submitted to the Security  Council for approval before 1 October 1993. But it is already  1994....    While the upper echelons are bestirring themselves, the  lower  echelons can no longer live in the old way. Thus, a department  to combat racketeering has been set up under the All-Russia  Association of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs. In short, the  "drowning" people have decided to save themselves....</p>

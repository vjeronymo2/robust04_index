			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Andrey Rangelov report: "No Immediate Danger for Bulgaria </F> Exists"]    [Text] There is no immediate danger of Bulgaria becoming  involved in the Yugoslav conflict, even if NATO goes through  with its threat to carry out air strikes on Serbian positions.  This is what Colonel Plamen Studenkov, deputy chief of the  Army's General Staff Intelligence Directorate, said in an  interview with BULGARSKA ARMIYA yesterday. The statement was  prompted by a report in a Sofia daily under the sensational  headline: "Intelligence Agent Number One Is Prophesying War in  Our Country." It is actually difficult to make any predictions  or express opinions on future developments related to the war in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, Colonel Studenkov commented.    According to the General Staff officer, our involvement or  noninvolvement in Balkan events depends entirely on our  country's future stand and policy, and on nothing else.    According to the colonel, Turkey is supposed to have  deployed  an air force squadron in Italy, as part of the joint NATO air  force contingent controlling the airspace over Bosnia.  Nevertheless, I am convinced that Turkey is not likely to  participate in any armed conflict with its military force,  Colonel Studenkov pointed out. He bases himself on the fact  that in its recent history Turkey has always shown an  essentially realistic approach to military conflicts, especially  on occasions when the use of armed forces outside the country's  territory was involved.    As far as Greece is concerned, that country not only opposes  the aforementioned air strikes, but it even refuses to get  involved in the Yugoslav conflict altogether. In addition, the  Greeks would react sharply to possible Turkish participation in  an armed intervention in Bosnia, according to the Bulgarian Army  spokesman. Colonel Studenkov presumes that the outcome of the  conflict will be clarified in the final days before NATO's  10-day ultimatum on the withdrawal of the Bosnian Serbs' heavy  weapons from the outskirts of Sarajevo runs out.</p>

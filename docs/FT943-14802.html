			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / Arco in Pounds 828m Algerian oil deal Atlantic Richfield of the US yesterday signed a Dollars 1.3bn (Pounds 828m) production-sharing deal in an existing Algerian oilfield with Sonatrach, the Algerian state oil and gas company. The aim is to double the recovery rate in the Rhourde el Baguel oilfield in eastern Algeria from 20 to 40 per cent of recoverable reserves. Of the total investment, Dollars 1bn will be spent in exploration over the next five years; the balance is the so-called 'entrance right'. This is the first agreement of this type concluded since Algeria's oil and gas exploration laws were liberalised in a new hydrocarbons law of December 1989. A string of oil exploration contracts have been signed over the past two years which have led to pacts signed between Sonatrach and more than two dozen international oil companies. The Arco deal came in the face of increased nervousness among foreign governments about the safety of their nationals in Algeria. On Monday, gunmen disguised as Algerian police killed four Russians and a Romanian working with Sonatrach. Suspected Moslem fundamentalists last week killed seven Italian seamen, and four Algerians died yesterday in a shootout outside Italy's Algiers embassy. Mr Livio Caputo, Italian deputy foreign minister, said in Rome that Italy had said it would reduce the number of Italians in Algeria and would boost security for expatriate workers and its diplomatic missions. Mr Antonio Martino, Italian foreign minister, discussed Algeria yesterday at a meeting in Paris with Mr Alain Juppe, his French counterpart.</p>

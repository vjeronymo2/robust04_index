The statement was made in an interview with XINHUA by the  Azerbaijani foreign minister, who is attending the fourth annual  meeting of the council of foreign ministers of the Economic  Cooperation Organization (ECO), which opened here today.    Up to now, he said, "Armenian forces have occupied 20  percent  of our territories. As a result, 50,000 people became homeless,  2,000 schools and hospitals were destroyed and ruined during the  war."    Moreover, he warned, "Armenian forces are trying to launch a  greater attack. They are even threatening us to occupy Baku,  the capital of Azerbaijan. They have created a very strong  army."    The minister told XINHUA, "we want to settle these problems  peacefully and through negotiations with the Armenian  authorities."    Therefore, he said, "we appealed to the world society and  communities to demand that Armenians should obey U.N. Security  Council resolutions and withdraw from our territories."    During the first session of the ECO council of ministers  this  morning, the Azerbaijani foreign minister also called on  international organizations to give political support to his  country and help solve the disputes.    In response to his call, Iranian Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar  Velayati, who is playing a mediation role between the two sides,  said at the meeting that it is unfortunate and the conflict in  the region has caused great concern among the people in the  world.    He said that Iran would like to witness peaceful settlement  of the dispute in the future.    Hikmet Cetin, foreign minister of Turkey, also expressed his  concern about the conflict, saying, "The situation in southern  Caucasus and especially the conflict between Armenia and  Azerbaijan require our immediate attention."    During his interview with XINHUA, Hassan Hassanov suggested  three measures to settle the problems:    -- "The aggressors" should comprehend and realize that "it  is  aggression."    -- Azerbaijan should have a strong army to drive the  "Armenian aggressors" out of the occupied territories. At the  same time, Azerbaijan wants to settle those problems by peaceful  means and negotiations.    -- The world organizations and the international community  should force Armenia to obey the international rules and  withdraw from its "occupied territories."    When asked whether Azerbaijan asked for military support  from  other countries, Hassan Hassanov said, "We mainly want political  support to solve this problem and never asked other countries  for military support because we do not like other countries to  interfere in any state conflict."    In addition, he said, "we consider economic sanction should  be adopted against Armenia because it uses economic support only  for military purposes."</p>

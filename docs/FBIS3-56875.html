Shakhray has already announced that he has accepted an offer to  fill the post of minister for nationalities and regional policy  in the new cabinet.    He made this statement at a press conference held on the  morning of 20 January in the State Duma building. According to  S. Shakhray, he is totally unperturbed at the reduction in his  status from vice premier to "mere" minister. He sees his main  task as being to ensure that the ministry he has been instructed  to head works effectively. He also hinted at the possibility  that the ministry will be directly subordinate to Chernomyrdin.    S. Shakhray also disclosed that, together with his party and  Duma faction colleague A. Shokhin, he has been subjected to  strong pressure from the PRUA [Party of Russian Unity and  Accord]. The party demanded that they remain in the government.  If only as ministers. The PRUA leader confirmed that A.  Shokhin has agreed to become economics minister.    In this connection S. Shakhray unexpectedly sharply  criticized Ye. Gaydar's departure from the government and the  possible departure of B. Fedorov. In particular, he stated that  the present complex situation in Russia "is in many respects  their handiwork." In his opinion, difficulties within the  government, which Ye. Gaydar cited as the explanation of his  decision to go, are objectively inevitable and it is dishonest  to quit because of them.    In answering numerous questions about the consequences of  the  government reshuffle, S. Shakhray expressed confidence that no  political force today will now be able to abandon reforms.</p>

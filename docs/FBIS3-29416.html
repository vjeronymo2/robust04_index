			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Merlinda Manalo] </F>   [Text] Foreign Affairs Secretary Roberto Romulo expressed  confidence yesterday China's protest over the meeting between  President Ramos and his Taiwanese counterpart, Li Teng-hui, will  not harm long-term RP [Republic of the Philippines]-China bond.    "From our perspective, we hope that situation (with China)  will continue as it is, and on the same basis as before," Romulo  said, adding:    "I am confident that in the long-term, friendly and cordial  ties with China will be enhanced further."    Romulo stressed the Philippines continues to adhere to a  `One-China' policy and clarified that a committee chaired by  Foreign Affairs Undersecretary Rodolfo Severino formed last year  was not meant to revise nor reassess the country's "One-China"  policy.    According to Romulo, the President's orders to the Severino  committee does not include a review of the Philippines'  `One-China' policy but only focused on studies on a "wholistic"  approach regarding the country's relations with China and  economic ties with Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau.    Romulo said President Ramos ordered the formation of the  committee after his state visit to China to underscore that  country's importance to the Philippines, Asia, and the rest of  the world as an emerging superpower and a key economic player in  the world market.    Romulo stressed that the government did not violate its  `One-China' policy because President Ramos' meeting with Li last  Wednesday in Subic only focused on trade and investments.    "Trade, investments, and economic diplomacy with Taiwan is  not in contradiction with the `One-China' policy," Romulo said.    The Chinese Embassy, however, stressed the meeting violated  the Philippine policy on recognizing only one China. It  emphasized that before the Ramos-Li meeting took place, the  Chinese Government had repeatedly expressed concern over Li's  trips to Southeast Asia.    "The incident has greatly hurt the feelings of the Chinese  people and sabotaged friendly relations between China and the  Philippines. Thus, the Chinese Embassy is instructed to lodge a  protest with the Philippine Government."    The embassy said it hoped the Philippines would learn a  lesson from the recent incident and would prevent similar events  from recurring in the future.    A DFA [Department of Foreign Affairs] official, however,  said  that the Chinese Government's protest was "baseless" since the  meeting could not be construed as a violation of the  Philippines' `One-China' policy.    Romulo said that the Chinese Government "may be dismayed but  they cannot be surprised" over the Ramos-Li meeting since they  have been notified of it beforehand.    "We value China in this part of the world so we will not  antagonize its government," Romulo added.</p>

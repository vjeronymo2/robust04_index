			<p><P> February 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CLASS TRANSLATES HOME SAFETY TIPS FOR LATINO SITTERS  </P> <P> Like many Southern Californians, Ismelda Durazo was jolted by the 1987 Whittier  earthquake. But that was nothing, she said, compared to the jolt she received  when she saw her Guatemalan baby-sitter's reaction to it.  </P> <P> "I was upstairs with my son when the quake hit, and my baby-sitter was  downstairs with my daughter. I yelled for her to get under a table, but she  still ran outside with my daughter," Durazo recalled.  </P> <P> "When I asked her later why she didn't listen to me, she told me it was what  she had been taught to do. She said: 'In my country, you run outside during  earthquakes, because if you don't, the house will fall on top of you.' "  </P> <P> From that experience, Durazo began to wonder if there might be other cultural  differences that could affect her baby-sitter's response to emergencies. The  conclusion she reached, she said, was not a comforting one.  </P> <P> "My baby-sitter is very bright," Durazo said, "but when she told me how people  in her country treat things like burns and fevers, that's when it hit me that  my children were at risk.  </P> <P> "Our beliefs here are so different than in the Latin American countries. Still,  no one was addressing it."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Filling the Gap  </P> <P> Convinced that there was an information gap that needed filling, Durazo left  her job as an insurance company clerk in 1987 and founded Safekids, U.S.A., a  one-day course designed for Latino housekeepers.  </P> <P> Conducted in Spanish, the six-hour class addresses topics such as infant  cardiopulmonary resuscitation, treatment of shock, accidental poisoning and  kidnaping awareness. At the completion of the class, each participant receives  American Red Cross certification in CPR from Durazo, who is a certified  instructor.  </P> <P> The American Red Cross itself holds a CPR class in Spanish in downtown Los  Angeles that costs $15. A Red Cross spokeswoman, however, said that the Red  Cross course does not address all the other safety issues covered in Durazo's  class.  </P> <P> Since Durazo first offered her course, several hundred housekeepers have taken  it at sites in Encino, West Hills, West Los Angeles and Manhattan Beach, she  said, adding that she plans to expand to Pasadena, Malibu and Newport Beach.  </P> <P> Although many of the misconceptions she confronts are held by people  everywhere, Durazo begins each class by addressing the ones she encounters most  often among women from Latin American countries. For housekeepers who are  working in the United States illegally, that often means dispelling a mistaken  belief regarding the consequences of dialing 911.  </P> <P> After one Salvadoran housekeeper attended a class held recently in West Hills,  she said in Spanish: "Before, I would have been afraid that if I called someone  in an emergency, immigration would come."  </P> <P> Only two of the 11 women in the class said they were legal residents.  </P> <P> Durazo, whose parents are from Mexico and who speaks fluent Spanish, said: "You  wouldn't believe how many women have said to me, 'Oh yes, I have heard of 911.  The lady told me to call 911 in an emergency.' But when I asked them what 911  is, they have absolutely no idea. The term 911 means nothing to them."  </P> <P> In most cases, Durazo said, housekeepers sign up for the $50 class at the  request of employers, who view the cost as an investment in precaution. "One  mother just wrote and said her housekeeper came back and wanted to know where  the flashlights and gas-shut-off valve were in case of an earthquake," she  said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> We All Have Pools'  </P> <P> Lesley Salisbury Thompson, a Los Angeles feature writer for British  publications, said she heard about the class from two neighbors who planned to  enroll their housekeepers.  </P> <P> "One of the reasons I wanted her to take the class in Spanish was that I think  there is a reluctance for many Hispanic women to admit they don't always  understand you," Thompson said. "We all have pools that pose a safety problem,  and the housekeepers spend a lot of time with the children, and so there really  is the need for basic information."  </P> <P> Lorena Gonzales, a housekeeper from Mexico, said her employer had an even  stronger personal reason for asking her to take the class.  </P> <P> "She asked me what I would do if her infant were choking, and I told her I once  pulled food from the throat of a little boy. She said: 'That was good, but in  most cases it wouldn't help,' " Gonzales said. "Then she told me that when she  was a child, on Christmas, her 1 1/2-year-old brother choked on food and died."  </P> <P> "If my mother had known the Heimlich maneuver, he might still be alive today,"  said Christian Gilbert, a civil engineer in Glendale who hired Gonzales to care  for her 3-month-old daughter.  </P> <P> For Sharon Piehl, a banking administrator who lives in Pacific Palisades,  enrolling her housekeeper in the class represented an attempt to deal with the  after-effects of tragedy.  </P> <P> Piehl was at home last March when a fire broke out in her neighbor's house  across the street and claimed the lives of three children who had been left in  the care of a Spanish-speaking baby-sitter.  </P> <P> The baby-sitter, who inadvertently caused a fire by draping a cloth over a lamp  to help one child sleep, ran outside screaming for help. By the time she and  some neighbors tried to enter the house to get the children, the home was  engulfed in flames.  </P> <P> "Everyone was so traumatized by this, including all of the housekeepers, we had  to do something," said Piehl, who organized a group of 11 housekeepers in the  neighborhood to take the Safekids course. "When I talked to my baby-sitter the  next day, I told her that if anything like that ever happened, everything was  replaceable except the children. This other baby-sitter thought she had time to  go back for the children.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Handling Crises  </P> <P> "I was told that in Mexico, many of the buildings are made of brick, and so if  there is a fire, it doesn't burn the same way," Piehl said. "They wouldn't  think a house could burn down so fast."  </P> <P> Today, Piehl said, she takes no chances when it comes to the children's safety.  </P> <P> "I have emergency numbers hanging right next to the phone, along with my  address," she said. "My baby-sitter may know where I live now, but not know"  the address "if there were a crisis."  </P> <P> Durazo, who teaches the course to about 40 women each month, said she believes  that kind of awareness could well be used by many other parents. Although she  said it is not uncommon for housekeepers to be unable to give the last name or  address of their employers -- at a recent class, for example, nine out of 11  women did not know their employers' last name -- that lack of information also  works both ways.  </P> <P> "Sometimes I'm really shocked by the things the mothers tell me," Durazo said.  "I ask them about their housekeepers, and they don't even know their last names  or where they live. God forbid they should hire a nut and she should take off  with their children."  </P> <P> Durazo said she recommends that employers ask for at least three references  from potential housekeepers and that, once hired, the employers make a  photocopy of a current form of picture identification.  </P> <P> In classes, Durazo also makes an effort to determine which housekeepers have  been informed about what to do in an emergency, and which ones have been told  nothing.  </P> <P> "I ask how many of them have been given a first-aid kit, and maybe two people  will raise their hands," she said. "Even then, no one has explained to them  what it is for.  </P> <P> "What that means to me," she said, "is that even if they have it, they don't  know how to use it."  </P> <P> The next Safekids classes will be held Feb. 10 in Encino and Feb. 16 in West  Hills.

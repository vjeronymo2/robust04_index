			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary signed KVB: "United States Losing Bluff-Poker </F> Against Serbs"]    [Text] Washington -- President Clinton bluffed and lost in  Bosnia. Early last week, American NATO airplanes launched two  air strikes on Serb positions. Officially, this was done to  protect the UN staff, but the real message was that the Serbs  should not seize Gorazde. Considering the unrelenting attacks  against the Muslim enclave, the Serb commanders clearly failed  to understand the message.    One week after the first attacks, Gorazde is still under  fire. The UN threatened new air strikes, but Washington had  already ruled out the possibility of a substantial extension of  military actions from the start. The last few days, President  Clinton tried very hard to convince the Serbs that the United  States, the United Nations, and NATO are not taking sides in the  conflict, and that NATO air strikes were not intended to change  the military balance in favor of the Muslims.    The U.S. President and his advisers speculated that,  following these very limited bombings, the Serbs would  understand that the West is serious about its threats. This  military message would prompt the Serbs to stop their military  action in Gorazde, and to return to the negotiating table.    The message to the Serbs was enforced by comments in  Washington, that the United States had crossed the Rubicon, and  that there was no going back: Indeed, a superpower should live  up to its commitments. In other words, if the Serbs ignored the  warning, the United States would have to launch large-scale  military operations.    The commentators were wrong. Apparently, Washington had not  taken any strategic decision at all on the future course of  action. The possibility that the Serbs would join the poker game  had not been contemplated, or at least not sufficiently. The  Americans had no answer to the taking of UN hostages and to the  renewed attack on Gorazde.    The option of new air strikes was ruled out. First of all  because the U.S. Government was concerned about the fate of the  UN military. And second because of the disapproving reactions  on the part of the Russians. The latter had strongly objected  to the bombings, and had deferred their plans to join the  Partnership for Peace in protest. The choice between Gorazde  and future relations with Russia went against Gorazde. And most  importantly, the United States had not crossed the Rubicon at  all: Clinton was afraid of military escalation.    Once again, it became apparent that Washington has no policy  at all, and that President Clinton's foreign policy is made up  of a succession of ad hoc decisions which are not based on any  coherent political concept. So the argument that a superpower  should live up to its commitments so as not to lose its  credibility turned out to be wrong. The policy pursued by this  administration is anything but consistent: It can go back to  square one without further ado.    There is a feeling of total malaise at the United Nations in  New York. It was already a well-known fact that the Europeans  are unable to take a military and political stand. Which is why  the United Nations was increasingly hoping for U.S. leadership.  Last year President Clinton lost credibility when he threatened  action but backed out because the Europeans raised objections.    However, it looked as if he had learned from his mistakes.  In recent months, the President repeatedly insisted that the  West should not utter empty threats. Last February's ultimatum  for Sarajevo was a success. After that, a few Serb fighter  planes were shot down. The United States linked a new political  initiative to the new determination, which led to a compromise  between Muslims and Croats. To everyone's dismay, however, it  is now revealed that the President lacks genuine interest in  foreign policy, and that he walks out when things get too tough  and dangerous.    American public opinion has not woken up, yet. This is  mainly because there are no American UN soldiers in Bosnia. In  addition, President Clinton has not taken the trouble, so far,  to explain to the American public why the Balkan states are so  important to the United States.    The political experts are divided. Many believe that the  United States should stay out of the hotbed because there are no  explicit U.S. interests at stake. Former Secretary of State  Eagleburger argues that the political will to play an active  political and military role is lacking. However, according to  Eagleburger and many other foreign experts, not only Bosnia is  at stake, but also U.S. credibility as a superpower.  Superpowers should not be soft, and certainly not utter empty  threats. Once the United States has decided to take military  action, it should deal heavy blows and not hesitate to bomb  Belgrade, for instance.    The antiquated bombs which were dropped by the F-16 fighter  planes last Sunday and Monday hit one tank and barely left a few  deep holes in the ground. However, they caused serious  political damage which goes far beyond Bosnia's interests.  North Korea must have observed with interest and relief that  U.S. threats need not be taken too seriously. If the Serbs can  make a fool of the United States, there is no reason for North  Korea to assume that the United States would take a tougher  stand against Pyongyang, and that it would stake everything to  keep North Korea from producing nuclear arms.</p>

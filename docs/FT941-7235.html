			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Bass establishes joint venture with Grolsch Bass, the UK's largest brewer, said yesterday it was forming a joint venture company to market and distribute Grolsch lager in Britain and Ireland. Under an agreement with the Dutch brewer, Bass will also have the exclusive licence to brew the lager at its plant at Alton, Hampshire. The decision is a departure for the Enschede-based company, which until now has never allowed its beer to be brewed anywhere other than in its own breweries in the Netherlands. Grolsch said it was changing its policy because it wanted to capitalise on the strength of its brand in the UK, particularly in southern England where premium brands account for 47 per cent of lager sales. Brewing in the UK had also become a more attractive option following the 1992 sterling devaluation and the growing strength of the guilder, the company added. Bass's production, which will cover casks, cans and bottles but not Grolsch's trademark swing-top bottle, is expected to begin later this year. Mr Jerry Fowden, chief executive of Bass Brewers, said the creation of the joint venture company - to be named Grolsch (UK) - did not involve a material investment by either the UK or Dutch backers. Bass will hold 49 per cent of the new company. 'We hope to double Grolsch sales to around 200,000 barrels a year,' he added. The agreement gives Bass the right to not only to distribute UK-brewed lager to its own pubs and hotels, but to a national network of 27,000 on-trade outlets and the off-licence industry. Grolsch also said it could not rule out the possibility that it would conclude similar types of arrangements in other markets, but declined to give details. The company's second-biggest export market after the UK is the US.</p>

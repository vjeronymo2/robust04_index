			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / Argentina whets foreign appetites: Companies rush to pick up pieces of a dismantled public sector AS Argentina dismantles almost its entire public sector, foreign companies are diving in to pick up the pieces. In little more than three years, the government has privatised 51 companies, raising Dollars 5.6bn (Pounds 3.7bn) in cash, cancelling Dollars 12bn of foreign debt and transferring Dollars 1.3bn of financial liabilities to the buyers of privatised companies. It has also won commitments from the companies' new managements for investment programmes averaging Dollars 4bn a year up to the turn of the century. In doing so, it has attracted respected international companies to run privatised corporations which have suffered from a lack of investment and years of neglect. British Gas distributes gas in Buenos Aires, France Telecom operates the telephones in the northern half of the country and Chilean companies generate electricity. Foreign companies' incursions into Argentina, an economy suffering hyperinflation a little over three years ago, often reflect wider international strategies. British Gas, which holds 29 per cent of Metrogas, the new Buenos Aires gas distributor, aims to expand substantially its overseas operations, which contributed 10 per cent of the group's 1991 profit of Pounds 921m. Mr Peter Lehmann, who headed the Metrogas acquisition, says Argentina represented an unusual opportunity to enter a large but under-developed gas market. Metrogas, with forecast annual turnover of Dollars 600m, will be among the world's larger distribution companies, yet it also offers significant growth opportunities. Improved maintenance, billing, and marketing techniques at all privatised companies can easily yield profits well in excess of the 12-16 per cent yield on Argentine government debt, the benchmark investment. The risks are still substantial, particularly if today's reasonably stable economy suddenly deteriorated. However, buyers think the government has set the prices they can charge high enough to fund investments and has also linked them to the dollar, reducing inflation and devaluation risks. Foreign investors also hope that participation of a wide group of foreign companies reduces the risks of any arbitrary rule changes for foreign companies. One foreign executive said: 'A government will think twice before intervening in a way that could upset foreign governments.' However one big early privatisation is already in trouble. The national airline, Aerolineas Argentinas, was privatised in 1990 - before a raft of changes to clean up the privatisation programme introduced by the reform-minded economy minister Domingo Cavallo. Spain's state-owned Iberia took 30 per cent. Government officials are now threatening to scrap the sale and start again from scratch because they say Iberia is not running Aerolineas properly. Last July, the government also had to take the place of Iberia's minority local partners when they failed to come up with the capital they were committed to inject into the struggling company. This has heightened concerns that the Argentine companies active in the privatisations as minority partners have paid too much for their assets and are financially overextended. This is denied by the companies. Mr Roberto Roca, president of Techint, a big industrial group, says he is not overstretched despite having spent Dollars 533m on large minority stakes in a railway, highway toll concessions, a steel mill, an electricity generator, a telephone network, oilfields and a gas company. He says Techint's debts of Dollars 450m are only one-third of the group's net worth, but does expect to increase debt by Dollars 100m a year. Mr Oscar Vicente, vice president of Perez Companc, Argentina's largest industrial conglomerate, says his company doubled its net worth to Dollars 1.9bn by buying Dollars 876.9m-worth of state assets. All the same, he says Perez Companc only took on debts of Dollars 350m, and promises that gearing will always remain 'exceptionally low'. Although the trade unions, while subdued, are still powerful, dealing with the legal and regulatory systems could be the privatised companies' biggest problem. Argentina's civil service has never shown much honesty or competence, and the concept of regulatory bodies independent of government policy is alien. The government has created regulatory agencies to supervise the telephone, gas and electricity services. However, only the telecommunications regulatory commission is actually functioning. The gas and electricity regulators have not all been appointed yet. The agencies are meant to be independent of government and their boards appointed for fixed terms. Yet in 1991 Mr Cavallo sacked the entire telecommunications commission board for incompetence, replacing them with his own appointees. The privatisation process still has some way to go. The government will soon begin floating off residual minority shareholdings in privatised companies, worth an estimated Dollars 2bn. And this year will see the beginning of the biggest privatisation of them all: the sale of 70 per cent of YPF, the national oil company and Argentina's largest company, worth in total over Dollars 8.5bn. There is a growing debate over the government's decision to sell YPF as a single unit, rather than breaking it into separate business units as it did to ensure competition in the electricity and gas industries. There is one big government asset that is not on the privatisation agenda - at least in the foreseeable future: Banco de la Nacion Argentina, the government-owned commercial bank and the country's largest financial institution. Officials say they need it because it enables them to oversee and put pressure on the private financial system. This is an explanation received sceptically by some in Buenos Aires, who believe that now that the central bank is independent, the government still wants an arm for discreet borrowing and financial support operations.</p>

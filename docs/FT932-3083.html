			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / Tax concession on luxury cars THE government has decided to set a ceiling of Pounds 80,000 on the prices used in calculations for the new system of company car personal taxation. The concession followed intense lobbying by luxury carmakers such as Rolls-Royce Motor Cars and Aston Martin.

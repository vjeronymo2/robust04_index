			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Brent Walker fails to find a new chairman BRENT WALKER, the leisure and property group which in March agreed a Pounds 1.6bn refinancing with its banks, failed to find a new chairman in time for its annual meeting yesterday. Instead, Lord Kindersley, who retired as chairman at the meeting, is to be replaced temporarily by Mr Ken Scobie, deputy chairman and chief executive. Mr Alan Clements, the group's only non-executive director, who had also planned to retire at the meeting, has agreed to stay on for a while. Lord Kindersley told shareholders that a number of possible candidates had been identified for the chairmanship. He said: 'The task facing your board is still enormous and we feel that it would be wrong to rush into such a vital appointment.' The appointment of new non-executives cannot take place until a new chairman has been found. It is thought that potential chairmen of the group want to clarify their relationship with the company's banks before accepting the job. Through the refinancing the banks became holders of more than 50 per cent of the group's shares and have to be kept informed of its financial position on a regular basis. Lord Kindersley also said that he expected news in the next two to three months on the Serious Fraud Office's inquiry into the group's affairs which was launched last summer. Mr George Walker, the former chairman and chief executive, has been interviewed as part of the inquiries. Lord Kindersley said that trading in the group's two on-going businesses, Pubmaster, which manages a chain of pubs, and William Hill, the betting shop group, was being affected by the recession. Sales of the non-core activities had also proved difficult because of the recession. An independent expert has been appointed to arbitrate between Brent Walker and Grand Metropolitan, the leisure company, in the dispute over the purchase price of William Hill. He is Mr Raymond Hinton, a partner at Arthur Andersen, the accountancy firm. Brent Walker is claiming a refund of part of the Pounds 685m consideration agreed in 1989 on the grounds that profits did not meet a forecast made at the time. Brent Walker shares were unchanged at 5 1/4 p.</p>

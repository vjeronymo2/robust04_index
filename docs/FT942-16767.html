			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: A card likely to be played Sir, I refer to your excellent appraisal of Chief Buthelezi's current position ('The Zulu factor', March 30) and Mr Chris Jones's letter (April 4). The 'ethnic card' is not a new one. Any reference to proceedings in the KwaZulu legislative assembly shows, for example, that the role of the Zulu monarchy was consistently taken into account whenever there were discussions relating to the 'homeland's' status in South Africa, in particular, whether or not 'independence' should be accepted. Inkatha, later the Inkatha Freedom party, is a political party which, though supporting the monarchy, is quite separate from it. Thus the request that the king and his advisers should participate in the constitutional talks should have been seen as key to deciding the future status of the monarchy and the limits of Zulu autonomy. The denial of his request means that the major political party of the Zulu, the IFP, (with reluctance) was represented at the talks, but the historical claims of the Zulu were left unvoiced. It is hardly surprising that the African National Congress, with some hindsight, should have recognised the problem and have played the ethnic card itself.

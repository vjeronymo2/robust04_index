			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Tokyo University Professor Yoshiaki Minowa: </F> "Establishment of a Watchdog System: Integration and Abolition  With Cost Awareness"]    [Text] 1. Instead of "bureaucrat-bashing" focusing on the  individual behavior of bureaucrats, a cool diagnosis and  prescription focusing on the system are necessary.    2. Among the suppliers of services, the government agencies  are monopolists with power capable of forcing expensive and  low-quality services on the consumers. Although they are  monopolists who are difficult to control, a system to check  their abuses is lacking, and the crux of the problem is the  defenseless plight of the consumers.    3. It is necessary to demolish the systems that are not  worth  continuing, to promote deregulation and private management as  much as possible, and to enhance transparency and increase  scrutiny of work content in the remaining aspects. It is also  important to change the traditional emphasis on generalists and  to improve the quality of services in order to cope with  increasingly complex tasks by stressing the use of specialists  and promoting exchanges with the private sector.  <H5>  Problems in the System; Long Lines at Art Museums </H5>   This spring, a number of events took place, including the  rice uproar and the abrupt resignation of the prime minister.  Others were hikes in public service charges and a seven-hour  wait at the Barnes Collection exhibit at the National Museum of  Western Art in Ueno. The successive hikes in public service  charges were criticized as dashing hopes for a business  recovery. However, let us focus on the evils of monopoly in that  the incentive to reduce costs is weak, given the fact that cost  can be transferred to price. The fear of being kicked around if  one is off guard and being free from the pressures of  competition are such evils and are not limited to public service  charges.    At the exhibit hall at the National Museum of Western Art,  in  addition to the standing frustration among people who can only  attend on weekends due to their work, if there is such a great  demand, why are the exhibit hours not extended into the  evenings? With set costs of display items and the exhibit floors  already paid for, the satisfaction of the users should be  greatly enhanced by bearing the variable costs. In a normal  enterprise, an all-night operation of a three-shift system would  be considered in order to improve earnings by raising the rate  of facilities operation.    The reason for beginning the bureaucracy debate with these  topics is because the focus should be on the circumstances and  the system in which the bureaucrats are placed, rather than on  the people called bureaucrats. We do not think that the  bureaucrats as a whole are a special existence. There is a  tendency for the bureaucratic debate to be called  "bureaucrat-bashing" by focusing on concrete cases, but it is  inappropriate. The focal point of examination is the system and  not the individual members. Instead of lecturing the cat that  ate the fish placed before it, the reason should be considered  and an appropriate measure should be adopted.    If the work of the bureaucrats is seen as providing  services,  the government agencies are not different from monopoly  enterprises. What is different is the difficulty for private  monopolies to provide effective abuse-prevention measures.  Monopoly profits breed potential competitors and are not easy to  maintain in the long term. They become subject to government  scrutiny and regulation as in the case of public service  charges. If stronger support is won from the consumers with  reduced costs and the profits are boosted, they become  incentives for increased returns and stable employment.    Despite the recognition of regional monopolies like electric  power companies, the first point is met by a contention that  they should be open to new participants and strong criticism  against regulation of new entry through a licensing system. Even  in cases where regional monopoly is inevitable, the contention  that a franchise system should be introduced with a limited time  of several years to induct the principle of competition follows  this trend. The introduction of a price-cap system which  recognizes room for discretion by regulated companies within a  given limitation responds to the third point.    Such abuse-prevention steps are virtually nonexistent in the  work of the bureaucrats. Also, virtually no learning effects are  seen from the experience of a tragic end to an economy which  placed the nation as a whole under a similar system. More  satisfactory circumstances over a long term probably can be  realized in the case of public service charges by the aggressive  use of incentive functions, including the introduction of a  price-cap system.    The characteristics of the work of bureaucrats appear more  directly than in the case of the exhibit. When the seven-hour  wait was known, did they imagine the existence of any tasks to  cope with other than the prevention of accidents? We should ask  the purpose of those persons responsible. Was there anyone who  considered improving the satisfaction of the people, including  those who gave up waiting in line? Are there any offices that  heard the complaints or considerd instituting such improvements?  Were there any persons who incurred any losses because such  great dissatisfaction was ignored? Does any system exist to  reward any person who might have won plaudits by responding to  such dissatisfaction?    The case of the museum is merely a symbolic example. Why are  the windows of the government offices open only during the  daytime on weekdays? Why must the people take the trouble to go  to the offices for their resident cards? It is necessry to  recall the gripes which everyone once held.  <H5>  Dearth of Specialists; Resistance to Change </H5>   The aim of the monopoly enterprise is acquisition of profit.  Because of an incentive to offer quality services at low costs,  the design of a system that uses such incentives is relatively  easy. It is necessary to note that, in the work of the  bureaucrats, the abuses become enlarged due to their potential  use of the power of enforcement in addition to their monopolist  position.    The trouble and time to go to the windows, the annoying  documents that are demanded, and coping with the almost abnormal  concern with mistakes in the documents are serious costs for the  users. In the case of museums, many people would probably give  up the idea of going.    This phenomenon will surface to an extreme degree in the  case  of many categories of licenses and permits. The problem is that  no office exists which is strongly aware of the fact that such  costs should be reduced and which will control them. It is  necessary to note also that such dissatisfactions do not merge  into a loud voice.    There are probably many readers who saw dissatisfactions  surface in concrete form in such cases as the Yamato Transport  Co, E.K. Taxi, and Daiei Inc., and wondered why others in the  industry did not express their frustrations. It is better not to  voice them. In other words, if they are silently acquiescent  because of the appeal of vested interests and the fear of  authoritative retaliation, it is indeed serious. Of course,  checks from the budget and accounting aspects for the prevention  of swelling government budgets and squandering are not counted.    It is also necessary to note the decentralized authority  system symbolized by the famous statement by Professor Emeritus  Junichi Kyogo of Tokyo University, who stated regarding  jurisdictional matters that the responsible divisions of the  main ministry represent the Japanese Government itself. Even the  private monopolies that share a common goal called profit suffer  from the abuses of decentralization called the "main enterprise  disease." In the government agencies which lack a clear common  goal, the independence and abuses of the various sectors were  greater.    The term of office of the responsible division director is a  maximum two years, and it is difficult to expect the realization  of a socially optimum services-supplying system that considers  such costs. A newly appointed division director probably cannot  even perform work similar to his predecessor without the  cooperation of his subordinates and the representative companies  under his jurisdiction. It is important because he will be  demanded to set forth a new axis to make known his presence  during his term of offfice, and to further contribute to the  "ministerial interests."    Be it a division or a more subdivided office, or be it a  bureau or a ministry, the essential problem is that a  supervisory role over the content and cost of the services is  nonexistent, and that an incentive to establish a supervisory  system is also nonexistent or has not yet been established. One  instance is the emphasis on generalists since the Meiji era and  the flip side of contempt for specialists.    Financial administration led by securities administration  has  long been ridiculed in some quarters for its failure to  establish a formation that is able to cope with the rapid  changes and complexities of the industrial areas under its  jurisdiction, and is barely able to recognize the changes within  its scope of management. The reality is that the managers in  electronics manufacturing companies are heard to say: "It is the  same situation in our field also," so finance is not an  exceptional case. However, it is cruel to say that they are  inattentive to details. Under the present system, it is true  that it is futile to pay close attention.    Some say that "Japan's bureaucrats are superior" or that  "Kasumigaseki" is Japan's largest think tank." However, although  it may be true about the superiority of its hardware in terms of  the speed of its reaction and the large size of its memory, it  should be recognized that the computer is just an ordinary box  without the proper software.  <H5>  Use of Outside Monitors for Overall Reorganization </H5>   There is no all-purpose remedy to cope with the monopolist  abuses of the bureaucracy. However, in the sense that there is  no system with an aspect of using its authority to force its  monopolist services, and scrutinizes and copes with the abuses,  the first step in coping is to recognize that the decisive lack  of cost-awareness is a conspicuous trait.    The beginning of a cure is an understanding that one has a  serious illness and is exposed to the danger of further  aggravation. It is also a sign of illness to retort against  concrete criticism with such wornout phrases as "it will not  work simply like painting a picture on a white background" or  that "steady and gradual is preferable to sudden reform," and  think that the matter has been settled.    There are various kinds of measures for coping. The first  kind is the abolition of stations that have not produced  benefits commensurate with costs in a broad sense. The second is  the introduction of the principle of competition and a more  aggressive use. The appropriateness of such expressions as  privatization and private consignment aside, an example is their  removal from the scope of the government office's work which is  difficult to control, including a bold reexamination of the  regulations.    The third kind is the introduction of outside monitors on a  constant or periodic basis for an overall reexamination of the  system. This involves public disclosure of the more concrete  content of the bureaucrats' work and a strengthening of  surveillance by the people through the Diet, for example. As in  the case of private enterprise, the use of outside monitors may  be worth consideration. Clarifying and fostering the role of  specialists and active exchanges with the private sector also  constitute a part of the measures.    It is not necessary to view the bureaucrats as a special  breed of people, nor is it appropriate. The difficulty of  controlling the quality of the services provided under the  bureaucratic system and the cost levels should be frankly  recognized, and a debate shold be started on the scope and  design of an appropriate system. Many readers probably sensed a  dissatisfaction which seemed unlikely to be remedied when they  heard the statement by an official of the Food Agency around the  time of the rice uproar that "the confusion would have been  greater if we were not here." They would probably ask at least  for some persuasive evidence.</p>

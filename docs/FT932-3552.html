			<p>930614 FT  14 JUN 93 / Birmingham to bid for Expo 2003 BIRMINGHAM business leaders will today seek support in the Commons for a bid to stage Expo 2003, an international fair, in the city. They are working through Birmingham City 2000, a professional and financial services group, and the Chamber of Commerce and want the government to promote the city's case at the Bureau of International Exhibitions, the inter-governmental organisation based in Paris which controls the timing and location of international fairs. The move of Birmingham lobbying to the Commons in the search for parliamentary backing for the idea follows two years of preparatory work and the completion of a feasibility study by Planning Industrial Economic Development Advisers of Edinburgh. Mr Bob Moore, chief executive of Birmingham City 2000, said the Birmingham fair would not be on the same scale as that held in Seville, Spain, last year, when 40m visitors attended Expo over six months. Birmingham is looking for 6m visitors over three months. Expo in Seville cost the Spanish government Pounds 1.1bn, while the UK government spent Pounds 25m on a British pavilion. Mr Moore said: 'At current prices the cost in Birm-ingham would be around Pounds 25m. The amount required is less than half the amount given to Manchester for the Olympics.' Existing facilities such as the National Exhibition Centre and the International Convention Centre would be used. The private-sector bid for Expo 2003 is supported by the Labour-controlled city council. It is the second Birmingham bid for a big international event in recent years. In the 1980s the city made an unsuccessful attempt to host the 1998 Olympic Games.</p>

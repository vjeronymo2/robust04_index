			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / International Company News: Investment yields fall at Japan's life insurers Lower interest rates and weak overseas returns produced a substantial drop in the investment yield at Japan's eight largest life insurance companies in the year to the end of March. Results published yesterday showed a decline of 0.5 per cent in the companies' yields to an average of less than 4 per cent. The fall forced the insurers to cut policyholder dividends for the fourth year in succession. The companies blamed the global trend towards lower interest rates last year and the sharp rise in the yen, which reduced profits from overseas securities. The decline in investment yield has heightened fears that most of the companies are now technically unable to meet their liabilities to investors. The life insurers are all mutual companies owned by their policyholders and are the largest group of institutional investors in Japan. In the late 1980s most companies wrote policies which guaranteed their members greater returns on their assets than they have subsequently been able to earn. Most analysts believe the Japanese insurers need an investment yield of at least 4.6 per cent to meet their liabilities. This figure is substantially higher than yields achieved in the last few years. But insurance law permits life insurance companies to count unrealised profits on equity holdings as profits, without requiring them actually to sell the shareholdings. All eight leading companies took advantage of the rule in the last year. Companies are now counting nearly Y11,000bn (Dollars 104.5bn) in hidden equity gains as profits to bolster their capacity to meet their liabilities, an increase of nearly 30 per cent on last year. Income from premiums and new policies rose strongly in the second half of the year, offsetting an unprecedented fall in the first six months, and securing a 2.6 per cent increase for the eight insurers together. Total assets rose by 8.4 per cent to more than Y130,000bn. Several of the companies face additional difficulties with substantial portfolios of bad debts. One-third of Japanese insurers' assets are in the form of loans, and during the so-called 'bubble economy' years of the late 1980s, some of them pursued increasingly imprudent lending policies, and have since found themselves burdened with large quantities of problem loans. Worst hit was Sumitomo Life, whose chairman, Mr Yasuhiko Ueyama, is to resign following the company's admission that its non-performing loans rose by 32 per cent in the year to March. Most of the loans were to Sumitomo Life's non-bank financial affiliates, a lending policy actively encouraged by Mr Ueyama. In a placatory gesture to disgruntled policyholders, most of the companies also cut or kept unchanged executive bonuses that had already been reduced in the previous year. Despite this, the divisible surplus fell by nearly 27 per cent to Y1,244bn.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------           Japanese life insurers: Year to March 1994 (Y bn)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------              Premium Change on   Total Change on Investment yield (%)               income  year (%)  assets  year (%)    1993-94   1992-93  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Nippon Life    5,790      +3.7  34,719      +8.3       3.48      4.16 Mutual Life    4,034      +0.3  24,295      +7.5       3.36      3.90 Life           3,615      +1.3  21,398      +8.0       3.91      4.14 Mutual Life    2,586      -0.7  14,825      +9.1       4.16      4.31 Mutual Life    1,922      +3.9  11,169      +8.0       4.00      4.54 Mutual Life    1,664      +1.2   9,255      +8.9       3.61      3.80 Mutual Life    1,638      +7.8   8,182     +10.2       3.92      4.31 Mutual Life    1,020      +5.0   6,317      +5.6       4.25      4.72  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Company reports  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

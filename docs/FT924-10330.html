			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Going Dutch Reed International will have to work hard to live up to the 20 per cent rise in its share price since the merger with Elsevier was announced last month. An interest in the Dutch publisher's recession-resistant earnings from scientific journals is certainly attractive. But Reed makes no secret of the fact that there is limited scope for cost-saving. At least a lower tax charge should recoup within a couple of years the startling rewards earned by the advisers. Vague promises of synergy hardly justify the rates of growth which the market now seems to be anticipating. A stronger credit rating for the merged group may increase the temptation to embark on a spree of debt-funded expansion. The Official Airlines Guide looks almost certain to be the first target. Even a bid for OAG, though, will leave Reed Elsevier with plenty of spare borrowing capacity to swallow up smaller targets in Europe. On the evidence of yesterday's pro-forma figures, the combined group could raise up to Pounds 1bn from banks or the bond market and still maintain comfortable interest cover of four to five times. The novel structure of the merger is meant to avoid the pitfalls of Anglo-Saxon style takeovers and the decision-making vacuum which can result from continental-style mergers. Nothing, though, can guard against the kind of boardroom bloodshed which has followed other, initially friendly, international mergers involving UK companies. One can only hope the two sides are as agreed on strategy as they claim.</p>

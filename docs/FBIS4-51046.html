			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Newsletter" by XINHUA reporters Wan Chengcai (8001 2052 </F> 2088) and Zhang Tiegang (1728 6993 6921): "Friendly Relations  and Cooperation on the Bank of the Amur River"]    [Text] Moscow, 22 May (XINHUA) -- On a sunny day in May,  we flew more than 8,500 kilometers southeast from Moscow and  arrived in Khabarovsk (Boli), a Russian border city of strategic  importance on the bank of the Amur River, for a 10-day reporting  trip in the Russian Ear East.    The Amur is a river on the Sino-Russian border, and  Khabarovsk City is located on the northern bank on the middle  reaches of the river. During the years when relations between  the two countries were tense, this was the frontier of military  confrontation filled with the smoke of gunpowder. Today, border  trade and various forms of economic cooperation have replaced  conflicts, turning the Amur River into a river of friendship  that links the feelings of the two peoples.    The Khabarovsk border region is graced with enchanting  sights, covers an area of 824 square kms, and has a population  of more than 2 million, 80 percent of which lives in the city  proper. Densely forested, the area abounds in such resources as  coal, zinc, and gold. Its industry is dominated by metallurgy,  machine-building, aircraft manufacturing, electric cable  production, petroleum refining, and woodworking, while fishery,  deer-raising, and commercial hunting are also booming sectors.  On top of the fairly developed shipping and air transportation  services, the trunk line of the celebrated Trans-Siberian  Railway crisscrosses the southern part of the region.  Khabarovsk, with a population of 600,000, is the capital of the  border region, as well as the largest industrial city and one of  the transportation hubs in the Far East.    In Russia's drive for economic reform, the Amur River has  taken the lead in opening up to the outside world. Pisarenko  [name as received], deputy director of the region's Foreign  Economic Liaison Bureau, told us: The Khabarovsk border region  has established economic cooperation and trade with 42 countries  and regions, of which China is the largest economic and trade  partner.    Pisarenko said exuberantly: The trade volume between the  Khabarovsk border region and China accounted for 45 percent of  the region's total foreign trade volume in 1993, rising by 340  percent from $115 million in 1992 to $391 million in 1993. The  trade structures of the two sides complement each other, with  the border region primarily exporting steel products, plants and  equipment, nonferrous metals, and timber to China, and importing  daily necessities and food from the latter. The female deputy  director said: Following the termination of the border region's  traditional economic ties with western Russia and the CIS  countries, rail freight has risen steadily, rendering the  region's economic relations and trade with China increasingly  important in the absence of self-sufficiency in industrial and  agricultural production.    What we witnessed here is not only the conduct of barter  trade with China, but also a growing interest on both sides in  the establishment of joint ventures. By January this year, 199  Chinese-funded enterprises had been established in the border  region, accounting for 45 percent of the total number of  foreign-funded enterprises. Of these, 144 are joint ventures,  and 55 are wholly Chinese-owned. Registered assets total $11  million, or 10 percent of the region's total foreign registered  assets. Moreover, experienced Chinese vegetable growers and  construction workers have begun to demonstrate their skills in  the Khabarovsk border region.    The reporters visited the largest country market in  Khabarovsk City. Several thousand stalls were neatly arrayed in  this market covering an area of some 20,000 square meters, where  vendors hawked their wares incessantly and customers jostled  each other. Most of the goods were clothing and other daily  necessities. In addition to local people, stall proprietors  included Chinese, Korean, Vietnamese, and Mongolian nationals.  The local official accompanying us on the trip said:  High-quality and inexpensive daily necessities and food  produced by China have greatly enriched the border region's  market; however, the reputation of Chinese goods has also been  sullied by some poor-quality commodities. The local government  official said: Most of the Chinese-funded enterprises in the  region carry out trading activities, and the number of  enterprises engaged in commodity production is too small.    Quoting Peter the Great during an interview with these  reporters, the Russian presidential representative in the  Khabarovsk border region, said: "The more a country conducts  foreign trade, the better its people's lives will become." He  expressed the hope that people on both sides of the river, who  have a century-old history of border trade, would further expand  mutually beneficial economic cooperation and trade.    With the clouds illuminated by the setting sun, the  picturesque Amur River seemed to be singing the song of  long-running friendship between people on both sides of the  river.</p>

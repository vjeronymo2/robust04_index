			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 10 KYODO -- Japan plans to provide South  Africa with its first yen loan as early as this summer to help  promote economic development under President Nelson Mandela,  government sources said Tuesday [10 May]. The loan will fall in  a range of billions of yen and its disbursement is expected  after an international aid panel designates South Africa as an  eligible recipient this summer, they said.    The loan will be used for projects to be picked up at the  request of South Africa and will include construction of roads,  ports and power plants, the sources said.    Tokyo intends to include South Africa among nations eligible  for aid because it is moving toward democracy, they said.    Japan will also expand its grant-in-aid program, focusing on  education facilities, technical assistance, medical support and  agricultural development, they said.    In tandem with other industrial nations, Japan to date has  not extended full-scale economic assistance in protest of the  country's apartheid policy. But some 100 million yen has been  given as grant-in-aid to support blacks since the Organization  for Economic Cooperation and Development's development  assistance committee allowed the assistance in 1990.    Japan and six other Group of Seven industrial nations agreed  earlier this month to coordinate their backing to South Africa  under its new government following the African National  Congress's victory in the first all-race elections.</p>

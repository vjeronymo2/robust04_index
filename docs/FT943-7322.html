			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / Poorest 'lose out' in benefit reforms The unemployed and students were among the biggest losers of benefits after social security reforms, according to a report yesterday by the London School of Economics for the Joseph Rowntree Foundation. It says most families with children gained from the changes brought in after the 1986 Social Security Act, while nearly half of all single-parent families and claimants without children saw their income fall. The report says the reforms will lead to an increase in the social security budget as more people are now aware that they can claim benefit. But it says the reforms fail in their aim to target benefits more effectively on the poor. The disposable income of income-support and housing-benefit recipients has fallen by 10 per cent in real terms. Of the poorest fifth of the population, 46 per cent are worse off because: Income support is less generous than previous systems. Students and young people aged 16 to 18 are no longer entitled to benefit. The replacement of the social fund with a system of loans and grants is equivalent to a 2 per cent cut in benefits.</p>

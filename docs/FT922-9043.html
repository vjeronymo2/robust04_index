			<p>920509 FT  09 MAY 92 / Arts: Odets in Ayckbournsville 'THE TIME is 1938 and the place is a dentist's waiting room in a New York office building.' In 1938, the year Clifford Odets wrote Rocket to the Moon, he appeared on the cover of Time Magazine. He was 32, and the Broadway plays he had already written included Waiting for Lefty, Awake and Sing, Paradise Lost and Golden Boy. His kind of realism had an intense and immediate influence on Elia Kazan, Arthur Miller and others. How interesting today, as his works are becoming period pieces, to see Rocket to the Moon in Scarborough - in Alan Ayckbournsville. For one thing, this is less of a period piece than you might expect. Its theme is perennial. Husband (dentist Ben Stark), almost 40 and henpecked by wife (Belle), falls in love with secretary (Cleo). Secretary, almost 20, falls in love with him. He feels he has never been so alive, she finds him more appealing than any other man, but he cannot bring himself to leave his wife. For another, Malcolm Hebden has directed the play handsomely. Sarah-Jane Fenton, playing Cleo as a Marilyn Monroe of 1938, is first-rate, always quietly writhing in her tight uniform, perfectly catching the girl's accent helplessly exploiting her teeth and eyes. Only Kenneth Price, as Ben, is too weak; he lacks the part's mixture of neurosis and integrity. Odets spices the story with humour and, thank heaven, with incidental detail. Afterwards, you also remember gratefully the shrewd medico neighbour, Frenchy Jensen (excellently played by Dale Ripley), the always surprising father-in-law Mr Prince (James Tomlinson) and the fact that the secretary Cleo has a gold-digger streak, lies about her background and is fairly dumb. In an immortal line, she tells Ben 'You know something? I can't read Shakespeare. The print's too small.' The play has two big flaws. It is bogged down - as Arthur Miller's plays have been too - by the leadenness of its philosophising and symbolism. Characters keep reminding each other that this particular situation is actually 'like millions of others.' Frenchy no sooner touches on the subject of this love than he has to rhapsodise cynically about all Love. And the sheer dramaturgy of Rocket is creaky. Ben seems to be a dentist virtually without patients. But then, how could he have time for them? Even at 10 pm his friends and acquaintances are busily popping in and out of his waiting-room and catching each other in mid-revelation as if this were Feydeau's A Flea in her Ear.</p>

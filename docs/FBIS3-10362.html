			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Carlos Eduardo Moreira Ferreira, president of </F> the Sao Paulo State Federation of Industries and Sao Paulo State  Industries Center, FIESP-CIESP]    [Text] The FHC [Fernando Henrique Cardoso] economic plan,  the main item of which is the implementation of the Real Value  Unit [URV], constitutes an organized government effort to subdue  the inflationary process, but it will not be successful in the  medium or long term unless it is supplemented by structural  reforms allowing the mounting of an effective fight against  inflation's roots and causes. When the URV is transformed into  the real, the economic program will be able to reduce the  present inflation rate to around zero. But this achievement will  be in vain unless the country can implement a state and tax  reform program, introduce changes into the social security and  political systems, and make other adjustments that are essential  for balancing the economic system.    We are afraid the FHC plan's effects will not last long  because we do not know if the economic stabilization strategy  based on the real will be maintained for long. We know the  structural problems were not removed. The fiscal adjustment  implemented so far has great deficiencies and loopholes. If we  are not capable of formulating more permanent answers to unravel  the crisis, we will surely fall down the same hill that  destroyed the Cruzado Plan, which had a big impact but a short  life. The simple change in currency will not take us anywhere.    In this context, we are greatly concerned by the cost to be  paid by industry and employees. We know that by indexing the  foreign exchange to the value of the real, eventual residual  inflations in the real will mean a loss of Brazilian  competitiveness in the internal and external markets. That  situation would disorganize the market, creating instability and  great expectations in the productive sector. This is precisely  why we hope the plan will be successful and sustained in an  orderly fashion, the constitutional revision process will end in  good form, meaningful changes will be promoted in the field of  monopolies, the privatization process will be speeded up, and  changes will be introduced in the field of social security,  among other items.    On the other hand, our industries vigorously defend the  maintenance of the purchasing power of workers' salaries. We  oppose any attempt at reducing salaries because we understand  consumers' purchasing power is an instrument that consolidates  markets. We also support the idea of maintaining salaries at  realistic levels. All salary losses must be negotiated before  the plan's second phase takes effect.    We also believe that the sooner the market converts to the  URV the sooner and more successful the plan's next stage, which  includes the creation of the new currency. Then we will be able  to rid ourselves of high inflation rates. We will closely follow  the next steps, knowing that the obstacles that still must be  overcome must be resolved through negotiations on all fronts.  That aspect might contain the secret of the plan's success. We  believe the country is already mature enough to discuss, at all  social and institutional levels, its priority programs and its  preferred path to definitively defeat this climate of crisis.    Industries expect politicians to be sympathetic to the  expressions of support and hopes of all social groups, and will  see in the FHC plan not an instrument to gain political mileage  but a program of substantial economic changes. This is why the  plan's success will depend on our legislators' spirit of public  service. Without structural reforms capable of supplementing the  FHC plan's weaknesses, we will again risk making the same old  mistake, the outcome of which we all know is not at all pleasant.</p>

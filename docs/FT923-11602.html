			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / London Stock Exchange: Ladbroke suffers steep fall PROPERTY and leisure group Ladbroke plunged in very heavy turnover as a combination of technical factors and renewed trading worries hit the stock. The shares continued to tumble in after-hours' trading as rumours circulated that the group would be issuing a statement today. A spokesman for Ladbroke dismissed the story as 'rubbish'. Early trading was dominated by two large lines of stock which had difficulty finding a home. Later, talk again focused on Ladbroke's exposure to the wilting US property market and the flat UK consumer market, where its leisure and DIY interests are suffering badly. The shares closed 17 off at 158p - their lowest since January 1988 - in turnover exceeding 7m. Traders were marking the shares down by as much as a further 15p in after-hours' trade as nervousness grew that a gloomy statement may be forthcoming. Lasmo steadier Further good news on the exploration front staunched the latest flow of selling in Lasmo, the oil exploration and production group. Lasmo shares have been undermined by a succession of bearish stories since the company's takeover of Ultramar. The group said yesterday that an exploration well in Morecambe Bay, off the coast of England, had produced an oil flow of 1,370 barrels a day, as well as gas from a separate zone. Lasmo has a 30 per cent stake in the block containing the oil and gas discovery. Monument Oil &amp; Gas has a 20 per cent holding. The oil and gas find is the second piece of encouraging drilling news for Lasmo this week. On Monday, the group's Indonesian gas reserves were sharply increased following an independent evaluation. Lasmo is due to announce interim figures next Wednesday. The stock settled 1 1/2 off at 125p, having fallen to 123p earlier in the day. Monument managed a minor gain at 32 1/4 p. Carlton wanted An improved recommendation from the company's broker was said to be behind the rise in new Footsie constituent Carlton Communications. The stock was the day's strongest among the FT-SE 100 components, appreciating 11 to 585p. Cazenove, which never comments on market speculation, was believed to have put Carlton on its buy list, focusing on news that the group's Technicolor unit had retained a film processing contract from Sony's Columbia Tri-Star. However, some analysts said fears of Carlton losing the contract had actually faded a few months ago. Varied attitudes among London share analysts following Tuesday's interim report from Reuters left the stock sharply lower. After some erratic trading, the bear view prevailed and the shares closed a further 35 down at 1090p. Agency broker James Capel reinforced its sell advice and argued that Reuters' cash mountain of Pounds 600m did not fit well with its high price/earnings ratio. BZW said: 'The company is now right at the top end of UK growth stock ratings,' adding that Reuters needs to approach 1025p before becoming attractive. However, broker Hoare Govett points out that the company is some 35 per cent held in the US, where its p/e relative is not nearly so demanding. Hoare is maintaining its buy stance and is considering raising its full-year profits forecast to Pounds 380m. Mirror Group Newspapers continued to rise against the market, with most traders believing a stakebuilder was at work. The shares firmed 1 3/4 to 65 1/4 p on another heavy turnover of 6.1m. Marketmakers are convinced that one buyer has been constantly picking up the shares with a view to a bid or, alternatively, a belief that the stock offers very good value. Most analysts say institutional investors acknowledge the value in MGN but are staying well clear because of the Maxwell aura still surrounding the company. The property sector picked itself up from its recent drubbing as bargain hunters were spotted. British Land, helped by a County NatWest note on superstore investments, put on 2 to 186p. Greycoat's good run continued as James Capel was reported to be positive ahead of today's figures, for which there is hope that the dividend will be held. Hammerson, missing from most broker's recent recommendations, at last found some support, the 'A' shares bouncing 8 to 260p. MEPC gained 7 to 267p, Land Securities 4 to 387p and Slough Estates 5 to 127p. Southend Properties jumped 6 to 42p on well-received results. SmithKline Beecham units were a penny firmer at 413p as one US house upgraded the company to a strong buy, but the 'A' shares eased 3 to 454p. After several days of selling pressure, Thorn EMI bounced initially with the help of a supportive note from Hoare Govett, the securities house, arguing that the group was now at the bottom of its relative range. News that the loss-making security division may be off-loaded, and a trade press feature claiming that the Office of Fair Trading would not be investigating compact disc prices, also helped sentiment. The OFT rejected the press comments, stressing that no decision had yet been taken on whether to launch an inquiry. The shares were finally 2 easier on balance at 743p. Unigate slipped 9 to 277p after chairman Sir Brian Kellett told the annual meeting that 'we must expect the present difficult trading conditions to continue for the time being'. Regional brewer Morland reversed an initial gain to finish a net 2 off at 461p, ahead of tomorrow's closing day for the bid from Greene King, 6 cheaper at 514p. Enterprise Oil rallied well, adding 6 1/2 at 325 1/2 p, with dealers arguing that the recent steep fall in the shares had been overdone. The stock was also helped by a bullish note on the exploration and production sub-sector issued by Hoare Govett. The combination of a large seller and the effects of an overhang of stock on dealers' books caused Siebe to drop 24 to 639p. Weakness in the construction sector was only one of the factors that undermined Trafalgar House. The shares gave up 5 1/2 to 67 1/2 p as dealers also focused on fears about the dividend and uncertainty over the Hong Kong Airport project, for which Trafalgar is a major contractor. Poor sentiment in the construction sector left P &amp; O 14 lighter at 344p. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1992 NEW HIGHS (5).

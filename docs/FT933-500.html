			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / Demoralised Khmer Rouge out in the cold: The severely weakened guerrilla group which claims to be 'tired of fighting' ONE of the few decisive steps taken by the Khmer Rouge guerrilla group in response to the momentous events in Cambodia this year has been to change the code name of Pol Pot, the reclusive Khmer Rouge leader based on the Thai border. Defectors say he is now known as '101'; before he was '87'. The extreme left-wing organisation which executed and starved to death an estimated 1m Cambodians during its time in power between 1975 and 1978 has been severely weakened by the UN's Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.2bn) peacekeeping mission and by the success of the UN-organised election in May. Mr Hun Sen, one of two prime ministers, said yesterday the Khmer Rouge had lost all political legitimacy and would be treated as outlaws, adding that it was the government's 'legal right to wipe them out.' Khmer Rouge leaders have repeatedly miscalculated since the Cambodian factions, together with Asian and western nations, signed a comprehensive set of peace accords in Paris two years ago. After signing the peace plan, the Khmer Rouge sought to sabotage the agreement by refusing to disarm its guerrillas and by attempting to disrupt the election. When sabotage failed, the Khmer Rouge demanded the right to be included in the political process anyway, but it was too late: the government is now in the hands of two of the other factions - the royalist Funcinpec party and the Cambodian People's Party (CPP) - and the Khmer Rouge is out in the cold. More than 1,300 front-line Khmer Rouge troops, representing about a 10th of the organisation's fighting strength, have surrendered and defected to the government since the election. 'We expected to achieve more, but the results didn't come. That's why we decided to opt for peace,' said Mr Em Ngoun, a 36-year-old Khmer Rouge colonel who surrendered in Kompong Chhnang on August 24 after more than two decades of loyalty to Pol Pot. As the highest-ranking cadre in central Cambodia to surrender, Mr Ngoun, commander of a special mobile regiment, has provided invaluable information to the outgoing UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia (Untac) and the Cambodian government about the slump of Khmer Rouge morale. In an interview at a government holding camp near the Cambodian capital Phnom Penh, Mr Ngoun said of his Khmer Rouge colleagues remaining in the jungle: 'All of them want to stop fighting.' He himself wanted 'to be a normal person, to do some farming, because I hate war.' Many of the defectors are suffering from malaria, and some have spoken of food shortages; but such problems are common in rural Cambodia, and the principal problem for the guerrillas appears to be the feeling that the Khmer Rouge leadership is bankrupt of ideas. After the election they were particularly demoralised to find that they were under attack not only from the army of their old enemy, Mr Hun Sen's CPP (installed by the Vietnamese invasion of 1978 which overthrew the Khmer Rouge regime) but also from their former allies in Funcinpec and the Khmer People's National Liberation Front. Khmer Rouge propaganda proclaiming a war of liberation against the Vietnamese occupiers was also wearing thin, partly because Untac radio was audible throughout the country. The Vietnamese say they withdrew their last troops in 1989, and many of the defectors said they had not seen any Vietnamese troops for years. In some areas, furthermore, Khmer Rouge fighters were running short of ammunition. Defectors have provided ample evidence that Thailand shamelessly flouted the Paris peace accords by allowing the guerrillas to be resupplied from Thai territory at least until February this year, but they also say the Thai authorities have started to restrict supplies - and Khmer Rouge movements inside Thailand - since the May election. 'The Khmer Rouge guerrillas are now facing their most serious political crisis, because they are isolated domestically and internationally,' said one senior Untac official in Phnom Penh. Lt-Col John Weiland, Untac's chief of military public information, added: 'We know they have lost the capability for major military operations.' The Khmer Rouge does have at least one more chance to come in from the cold, and that is during the 'round-table' talks that King Norodom Sihanouk is expected to host in November. It is not clear, however, whether the Khmer Rouge will be prepared to meet the demands of rival political parties and abandon control of its own zones in northern and western Cambodia to the central government; the organisation makes millions of dollars of year by selling timber and gems from the area around its headquarters in Pailin near the Thai frontier. 'If they continue their ways, definitely they will become outlaws,' said Prince Ranariddh, who is King Norodom's son, Funcinpec leader and senior prime minister, as he emerged from parliament after the adoption of a new democratic constitution on September 21. Although some diplomats are wary of prematurely consigning the Khmer Rouge to the dustbin of history - US intelligence was notoriously dismissive of Khmer Rouge strength just before the guerrillas took power in 1975 - the hundreds of recent defectors have provided sufficient proof that Pol Pot and his colleagues are politically confused and militarily weakened. Asked why he had surrendered after 20 years of fighting, Mr Siv Nin, another Khmer Rouge colonel and regiment commander, replied: 'Because I'm very tired of war.'</p>

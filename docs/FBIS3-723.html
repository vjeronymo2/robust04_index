This is the second visit to Huambo by the UN  representative in Angola. He arrived in Huambo at 0850 coming  from Lusaka. He was accompanied by three members of the UNITA  delegation in Lusaka -- Eugenio Ngolo Manuvakola, delegation  chief and UNITA secretary general; Dr. Jorge Alicerces Valentim;  and Ambassador Isaias Samakuva. [passage omitted]    The meeting between Dr. Beye and Dr. Jonas Malheiro Savimbi  began at 1035 and lasted more than four hours. It was attended  by members of the presidential office and the party political  commission, including Army General Arlindo Chenda Isaac Pena  Ben-Ben, chief of the general staff of the Armed Forces for the  Liberation of Angola [FALA]. No details have been revealed  about the talks held today between the United Nations and UNITA.  Sources close to the meeting told the Voice of Resistance of  the Black Cockerel that Beye and Dr. Savimbi held a multifaceted  and in-depth debate on issues connected with the peace talks in  Lusaka.    Alioune Blondin Beye lunched with President Savimbi and left  for Luanda this afternoon. The sources also said the talks were  characterized by an atmosphere of cordiality. It is hoped Dr.  Beye took UNITA proposals to Luanda.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Commentary by Yan Qialin (7051 0595 2651): "Low Growth or </F> High Growth--What Is the Actual State of Our National Economy?"]    [Text] What is the actual state of the current  Chinese economy? Based on the new conditions that have  appeared in our economic operations in the first few months of  1994, the experts have recently presented certain differing  views.    In 1994, China's industrial production, in addition to  continuing to be restricted by transportation, energy, and raw  materials "bottlenecks," has also run into certain new problems,  the more glaring of which are fund shortages and marketing  difficulties. In many places, "triangular debt" has resurged,  not only interfering with normal enterprise production, but also  having a severe impact on fund turnover, profit and tax  payments, and employee [wage] distribution. Due to poor sales,  the first two months of 1994 contrast with the same period in  1993 as: the manufactured goods sales rate is down 1.6 percent;  finished goods inventories of independently accounted industrial  enterprises throughout China top 400 billion yuan, up 30 percent  from the beginning of 1993. Impacted by funds and sales,  state-owned industrial production growth in 1994 is nearly  stagnant, up only 1.2 percent for January and February over the  same period in 1993. This includes declines in state industrial  production of 2.4-4.4 percent in places, such as Shanxi,  Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang.    In light of these phenomena, the analyses of certain  economics experts hold that this impact on state industry will  gradually be reflected somewhat in the production and sales of  township enterprises and other similar types of enterprises, so  that the Chinese economy in 1994 is likely to see low or even  zero growth.    But certain other experts take the absolutely opposite  view, holding that 1994's growth rate not only will not be low,  but even will be higher than 1993's. Their key grounds are  that overall investment and consumer demand are now both  brisker. Meanwhile, the growth momentum of coastal and township  industry remains quite strong, averaging over 20 percent for the  first two months in places, such as Guangdong, Fujian, and  Jiangsu; township-run industrial output value is still growing  at a rate of 49 percent; the growth of the three kinds of  foreign trade enterprises and private industry is even higher at  76.4 percent.    So will the Chinese economy in 1994 see low growth or  high growth? It seems that we still need to analyze more  conditions.    As long as China's inflationary pressures are quite  strong, a too fast economic growth rate will cause high  inflation, which in turn will severely threaten 1994's overall  reform and social stability, finally forcing us to take  "brake-slamming" steps. So while things are tight, an economic  slide is inevitable. To prevent this, the center has not only  set forth clear macroeconomic regulation and control  targets--GNP growth of 9 percent, industrial production growth  of 15 percent, an investment scale of 1.3 trillion yuan, and new  loans of 470 billion yuan, but has also taken effective steps,  such as stopping up "the two floodgates" of money supply and  credit, and conducting a strict "two controls"--controlling too  fast growth of investment scale and too much expansion of  consumption funds. Our experience in the last half of 1993  showed that as long as we exercise timely macroeconomic  regulation and control, we can prevent economic overheating, to  maintain the sustained and sound growth of our national economy.  So it seems that there is little likelihood that the Chinese  economy in 1994 will overheat again or see growth rates higher  than in 1993.    Our 1994 growth rates will be neither too high or too  low. While some areas and enterprises have recently run into  certain thorny problems, with new conditions appearing in  economic activities, this will not be enough to impact and  change our good growth momentum of recent years. In short, the  international economic climate, domestic public demand, and  basic industry supply capability and credit fund conditions will  all support the continued rapid growth of the Chinese  economy.    1. The faster growth of the world economy,  particularly the recovery of the economies of Western countries  after 3 years of recession, will provide the opportunity for the  rapid growth of the Chinese economy. On one hand, investment by  foreign firms in China will maintain its very brisk momentum; on  the other, driven by world economic growth, international market  demand and trade will increase sharply, which will be highly  beneficial to increased Chinese export trade.    2. Since we exercised [tightened] macroeconomic  regulation and control in the last half of 1993, our residents'  savings are up sharply, and our banking system, after being  rectified, has also amassed a sizeable amount of available  funds. These will both provide funding sources for maintaining  a definite overall investment scale in 1994, as well as for  further alleviating enterprise working capital shortages.    3. The series of significant reform steps that we took  at the beginning of 1994 will gradually become a new and  powerful driving force to promote the sustained growth of the  Chinese economy. Meanwhile, local governments at all levels  and enterprises remain subject to an inherent impulse calling  for faster growth, with the Central Government also emphasizing  that development opportunities be seized, and certainly not  hoping that its macroeconomic policy orientation will bring  growth rates back down too much, to cause a chain reaction and  shock.    4. While 1993's macroeconomic regulation and control  shrunk capital construction investment somewhat, "projects"  still exist, with 1994's ongoing scale still quite large, which  is substantial grounds driving rapid economic growth. As to  consumer demand, 1994's increase in wages for employees in  administrative organs and institutions will bring enterprise  employee wage increases; peasant income is also expected to  continue to grow steadily. So as both urban and rural incomes  grow, overall consumer demand, along with consumer markets, will  maintain steady growth.    5. Recently, our transportation, energy, and raw  materials supply conflicts have eased somewhat. And in light of  the growth of our basic industry supply capability and our  import-export adjustment, the rapid growth of the Chinese  economy in 1994 is also ensured fundamentally and  materially.    In addition, township, the three kinds of foreign  trade, and private enterprises have not only become a vital  new force on our economic front, but also are maintaining a  strong growth momentum. So even though our state industry  growth rate is not high, this will not have a substantial impact  on the rapid growth of our national economy in 1994.    According to the general pattern of China's  economic-growth boom-and-bust cycle, after two successive years  of rapid growth, growth will top out and begin to fall back in  1994, so that our economic growth rate will decline somewhat.  But an analysis summing up conditions in all areas shows that  this decline will not be very large, so that our 1994 economic  growth rate is likely to remain at about 11 percent.    The matter that currently needs attention is the need  to earnestly tighten and improve our macroeconomic regulation  and control, by controlling our investment scale, in order to  curb price rises. The appearance of severe inflation would not  only have a negative impact on our social stability and reform  progress, but also would force our economic operations to a  "hard landing."</p>

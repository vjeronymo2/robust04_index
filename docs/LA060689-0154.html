			<p><P> June 6, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> PACKERS, DRAFT PICK BATTLE OVER PAY  </P> <P> The Green Bay Packers have offered their top draft pick, Tony Mandarich, the  same amount the Atlanta Falcons paid linebacker Aundray Bruce after Bruce was  picked first in the NFL draft last year, a Packer executive says.  </P> <P> "I don't think anybody in the National Football League is going to pay  quarterback money to an offensive lineman," Tom Braatz, Green Bay's vice  president of football operations, said Monday of Mandarich' request. "It's not  just Green Bay. Even if he was with the L.A. Raiders, I don't think they  would."  </P> <P> Mandarich is seeking the same amount at which quarterback Troy Aikman signed  with Dallas. The Green Bay Press-Gazette listed the former Michigan State  lineman's request at $1.839 million a year and the Packers' offer as $820,000 a  year. Packers President Bob Harlan said the disparity in numbers at this stage  doesn't necessarily mean that agreement won't be reached later.  </P></p>

			<p>of   Baykonur   <F P=102> 947Q0120 Moscow KOMMERSANT DAILY in Russian 16 Apr 94 p 22 </F> <F P=103> 947Q0120 </F> <F P=104>  Moscow KOMMERSANT DAILY </F> <F P=105>  Russian </F> CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Mikhail Kirtser, under the rubric "Russian </F> Cosmodrome": "Plesetsk Could Take Over Baykonur's Program If the  Money Were Provided for That"; first paragraph is source  introduction]    [Text] Yesterday, KOMMERSANT DAILY correspondent  Mikhail Kirtser returned from the Arkhangelsk province, where,  in the middle of the forest, stands the Russian cosmodrome  Plesetsk, used exclusively for 30 years for military purposes  and officially called a state testing ground. For the first time  ever, the commander of the strategic missile forces allowed  Russian journalists in, demonstrating for them the latest  strategic Topol missiles (SS-25), as well as how a missile  regiment is trained.    During the training sessions, the photocorrespondents  practically begged the missilemen to raise an intercontinental  missile to the vertical position. But the military officials  explains that that procedure is irreversible: a missile can  assume the ready position only if the "launch" command is  received. The press decided not to continue insisting. Instead,  they were able to observe the passage of missiles and support  vehicles and the camouflaging of a launcher at the ready  position in the forest. Then, this correspondent went to the  training center, where maintenance warrant officers and officers  were being trained.    The Plesetsk cosmodrome is a whole complex of the most  varied  of buildings and structures. A missile regiment for mobile  strategic missiles whose training was observed by  representatives of the press was only part of that complex.  There are also ground launch pads that are automatically  associated with the now-foreign Baykonur. In fact, we couldn't  peek into the missile silos -- their hatches can be wheeled open  with a special mechanism only (whose operation could be "noted"  by the press and by orbiting reconnaissance satellites) -- but  instead were able to check out a railway-based missile system  (in February, KOMMERSANT DAILY wrote about an accident that  occurred with that same system).    The true purpose of the invitation of the journalists was  explained at the concluding press conference, which took place  in the closed city of Mirnyy, near the cosmodrome. The head of  the testing ground, Lt. Gen. Yuriy Zhuravlev, declared that he  felt it was wrong to split up the countries missile forces into  strategic missile forces, military-space forces, and active  ballistic missile defense forces. In his opinion, such a  division only complicates management and increases the costs of  maintaining those forces. The lieutenant-general also declared  that the capabilities of the testing ground are such that,  without any additional reoutfitting, it could not only maintain  the combat readiness of the strategic missile forces, but also  take over the civilian space programs from the Baykonur  cosmodrome (especially since Mirnyy is the site of a  concentration of scientific institutions whose intellectual  potential has made it possible to produce a high level of  efficiency and reliability for Russian space hardware). There's  only one problem -- not enough money.</p>

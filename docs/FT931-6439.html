			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / Protests grow against Chamorro NICARAGUA'S President Violeta Chamorro is facing mounting protests against her government's links with the leftist Sandinistas, her predecessors in office, Reuter reports from Managua. On Sunday about 30,000 protesters packed Managua's main plaza, many shouting 'Out] Out] Out]' at the mention of the president's name. The crowds arrived by bus from the west of the country and from marches held in the capital. The speakers, cheered on by the crowd, accused Mrs Chamorro of betraying promises from the 1990 campaign, when she headed the 14 parties that formed the National Opposition Union to defeat the Sandinistas. No incidents were reported at the rally, organised by right-wing politicians from the same coalition that elected Mrs Chamorro three years ago, but one leader threatened to call for widespread civil disobedience against the government. A series of speakers urged Mrs Chamorro to dismiss her chief aide, Mr Antonio Lacayo, and General Humberto Ortega, the Sandinista who stayed on as chief of the defence forces. A virulent attack on Mr Ortega by US Senator Jesse Helms was read out at the demonstration. Mr Helms, a North Carolina Republican, has helped delay US aid to Nicaragua on the grounds that the Sandinistas wield too much power. The Sandinistas won 42 per cent of the vote in the 1990 elections. Mrs Chamorro has rolled back much of the Sandinistas' revolutionary programme, established a largely free-market economy and widened the bounds for political dis-sent.</p>

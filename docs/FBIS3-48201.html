It did this to secure a stable supply of gas, demand for  which has recently soared for home use and power stations, a  ministry spokesman said.    Korea previously imported natural gas from only Indonesia,  Malaysia and Australia.    The ministry will import 56,000 tons of natural gas from  Brunei next month and make a long-term contract with the country  to buy 600,000 tons to 1 million tons a year after 1995, he said.    Brunei charges 169 U.S. dollars a ton for its gas, compared  with 172 dollars for Malaysia and 206 dollars for Indonesia.    The ministry is to increase imports of natural gas 20.7  percent from 4,453,000 tons last year to 5,376,000 tons this  year.    Korea's demand for natural gas is expected to increase about  22 percent over 1993 to 5.32 million tons this year.</p>

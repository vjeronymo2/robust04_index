			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / OECD Economic Outlook: Britain top when it comes to hitting the bottom THE recession in the UK has been significantly worse in terms of lost output than in all but two of the other periods of economic decline affecting the world's richest nations over the past 20 years, according to the OECD. In what amounts to a statistical guide to recessions, economists at the OECD have analysed all the periods of economic decline since the 1970s in the seven leading industrial countries - the US, Japan, Germany, France, Italy, Britain and Canada. Out of 28 such downturns, the current British recession scores in the bottom three in terms of what the OECD calls the 'output gap' - a measurement of growth in gross domestic product. Of the total of 28 downturns considered by the OECD - four for each of the seven countries - the only two periods which have seen an output gap of a comparable size to the one now affecting Britain are the current Canadian recession and the Canadian recession of the early 1980s. During the 21 periods of downturn which took place in the seven countries until the mid-1980s, the level of GDP at the trough for each period was an average of 3 per cent below the trend for the nation concerned. This indicates that the current British and Canadian recessions are about twice as deep as the average, using this particular measure of lost output. According to this measure, the current UK recession is significantly worse than the other periods of decline in the UK economy since the early 1970s, which took place around 1971-72, 1974-75 and 1981-82. The current downturns in Germany, Italy, France and Japan are in each case shallower than the average for all 28 periods of decline which have involved the seven nations since the early 1970s. According to the OECD, the recession in the US which now appears to be ending is about the same in terms of depth as the average for the periods of economic decline over the period.</p>

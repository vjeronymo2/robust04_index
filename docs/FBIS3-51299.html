We are waiting  for a telephone call from one of our correspondents. Is he on  the telephone? Is he ready? Here is Juan Carlos Santoyo, who  is the ACIR group correspondent in San Cristobal de las Casas in  Chiapas. We are going to put him on the air. Are we on the air?  We are listening to your report, as it seems to be very  important.    [Santoyo] That's right, Mr. Calderon. After days of waiting,  today we can see a breakthrough in communications between the  Zapatist National Liberation Army [EZLN] and Manuel Camacho  Solis, special commissioner for peace and reconciliation in  Chiapas. A few minutes ago, Camacho Solis hosted a  news...[pauses] He is now holding a news conference. He is  reporting that the first formal, official contact was  established with EZLN leaders. He received a communication  directly from Deputy Commander Marcos. Mr. Calderon, I am going  to play an excerpt of that news conference during which this  major announcement was made. It constitutes another step toward  peace and reconciliation in this state.    [Calderon] You are going to broadcast an excerpt of the news  conference.    [Begin recording] [Camacho] I will be very brief [four-  second break in reception] I want to tell you that I have  already received an official message from the EZLN signed by  Deputy Commander Marcos. I am going to Mexico City to brief the  president, other members of the government, and those who should  be informed of the communique. We will have a formal reply for  the EZLN tomorrow at 1100 [1700 GMT]. Things are on the right  track. The decision to initiate a cease-fire and -- above all  -- the decision to request the Permanent Committee of the  National Congress to convoke a extraordinary period of sessions  so the executive can submit a general amnesty bill are yielding  results. The path of harmony and conciliation is the right  path, as the facts are proving. [end recording]    [Santoyo] Mr. Calderon, this is very important information  because this is the first contact between the EZLN and the  commissioner for peace and reconciliation. Basically, we were  told the points to be negotiated are those contained in the  first communique the EZLN issued on 6 January. Those points  include the demand for the definitive withdrawal of Mexican Army  troops from the zone and the withdrawal of many troops to their  garrisons. The cease-fire was also mentioned. They also  demanded a process of true reconstruction in Chiapas. As you  heard, the commissioner for peace and reconciliation will have  an answer tomorrow at 1100.    [Calderon] What time did Mr. Camacho give the news  conference  in San Cristobal de las Casas?    [Santoyo] At exactly 1135 [1735 GMT]. We left for a while to  broadcast this first good news.</p>

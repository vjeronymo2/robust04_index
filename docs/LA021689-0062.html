			<p><P> February 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> QUAINT LITTLE INN BESTS BIG LUXURY CONDOS  </P> <P> Old World charm beat out upscale progress this week when the Ventura City  Council blocked a luxury condominium project that would have dwarfed a quaint  European bed-and-breakfast inn next door.  </P> <P> Darrik Marten Development, which proposed the Island View Townhouse Project, a  three-story complex of three swank condominiums on Poli Street, said it would  have helped revitalize the lagging downtown area.  </P> <P> But Gisela Flender Baida, the German-born owner of La Mer Bed &amp; Breakfast,  complained that the project would have robbed her two-story inn of its ocean  view and quiet, homey ambiance.  </P> <P> What might otherwise have been just another routine zoning dispute thus erupted  into a symbolic battle.  </P> <P> Even though the size of the condominiums did not exceed city zoning standards,  the council unanimously rejected them as too tall and too bulky to stand next  to the 99-year-old Victorian structure that has housed La Mer since 1985.  </P> <P> "I know it's subjective, and I really don't like to do something like that,"  Councilman Don Villeneuve said. "But we have to realize that we have distinct  neighborhoods where the architectural flavor, the scale, the era represented  and the historical continuity are all important.  </P> <P> "I hope we sent out a message to developers telling them they have to abide by  architectural guidelines that go beyond just dimensions."  </P> <P> Michael E. Wooten, president of the development company, which won unanimous  approval for the 6,000-square-foot project from the Planning Commission in  December, said the message came a little late in the game.  </P> <P> "If a zoning ordinance establishes rules for a zone and a landowner goes in and  presents a project consistent with that zone, it seems reasonable for the  landowner to expect to have the project approved," Wooten said. "For the city  to reverse that normal process is not in keeping with good planning practice or  in good faith with landowners."  </P> <P> For Baida, however, the council decision represented a victory that she said  meant the difference between economic life and death.  </P> <P> Her five-room inn, which was termed one of 15 top romantic getaways for lovers  in the Los Angeles Times Travel section Sunday, depends on such intangibles as  charm, airiness and good cheer for its success, she said.  </P> <P> Donning an innkeeper's apron, Baida told the council: "If this happens and my  little Victorian landmark gets squished, . . . I might as well commit suicide."  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Unanimity  </P> <P> During the 2 1/2-hour public hearing, numerous neighbors and downtown merchants  sympathized, but many others didn't.  </P> <P> "That parcel is not likely to remain a eucalyptus grove into perpetuity," said  Larry Matheney, a Ventura Port commissioner, referring to the steep hillside  lot where the condominiums were planned. "Change is going to occur."  </P> <P> But Bobbye Ming, an uphill neighbor, said change should not come at the expense  of longtime residents.  </P> <P> "Are you going to allow the developers to come in here and steal the view from  those of us who didn't have to steal it from anyone?" she asked the council.  </P> <P> Ironically, the dispute mirrored a battle that neighbors fought against La Mer  before its opening in 1985, when they complained that the inn would generate  traffic problems and threaten the residential flavor of the neighborhood.  </P></p>

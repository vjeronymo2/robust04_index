			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: It's right to emulate where the action is Sir, Robert Bischof's Euro-centric view misses the point (Personal View, June 10). Yes, the UK 'is so often in a minority of one in Europe'. But Britain's economic and social policies are not out of line with those of North America, and not far different from the industrialised countries of Asia Pacific. That is where the action and the growth is taking place, Mr Bischof, not Europe. Britain's attitude is not a sign of being wrong. It is a sign of being right.

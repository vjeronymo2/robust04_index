			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / Reich seeks action on labour standards Multilateral development loans and grants should be used as carrots and sticks to encourage developing nations to improve their labour standards as their economies grow, Mr Robert Reich, US labour secretary, has urged. All countries should be held to certain minimal labour standards, Mr Reich told a House banking subcommittee that oversees international development and trade. States employing slave, prison or child labour, and denying workers the right to organise and bargain collectively, were 'outside the community of civilised nations', he said. Beyond these fundamental standards, said Mr Reich, the US should be cautious, realistic and pragmatic in its expectations of developing nations' labour practices. 'The international community clearly cannot attempt to dictate levels of working hours, minimum wages, benefits or health and safety standards uniformly matching those of the US and other industrialised nations,' he said. 'While it is neither fair nor realistic to insist that labour standards within developing countries must be identical to those in richer countries, it is appropriate to expect labour standards to improve as economies develop.' In addition to core labour standards, Mr Reich recommended a two-part test to evaluate how developing nations should be ranked for multinational aid - the existence of democratic institutions and evidence of improving trends in labour conditions. 'The less democratic the country, the greater the grounds for suspicion or concern that labour standards are being suppressed in order to serve narrow commercial interests or in a misguided mercantilist impulse on the part of the elites,' Mr Reich said. Mr Reich's statements come at a time of growing debate in Congress and across the country about whether the US should pass legislation to implement the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. He warned that the debate over international labour standards should move beyond simple free trade versus protectionism arguments. But the labour secretary was attacked from both the right and left on just such grounds. 'I would hope that we don't tie some conditions to what a country has to have before we can trade with them,' Mr Alfred McCandless, a California republican and free-trader, said. 'We do not seem to take this attitude or approach with the people we give foreign aid to.' Mr Bobby Rush, an Illinois Democrat, berated Mr Reich for having an 'academic' attitude to US jobs. Mr Reich repeated his view that in an increasingly global economy, government should stop thinking of companies as 'American' or 'foreign' and develop a new patriotism based on its citizens, not its products.</p>

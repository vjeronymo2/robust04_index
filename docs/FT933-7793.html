			<p>930819 FT  19 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Richardsons Westgarth rises 37% but warns on second half RICHARDSONS Westgarth, the steel stockholder and processor, achieved a 37 per cent increase in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 1.03m to Pounds 1.42m, for the first half of 1993. The outcome was achieved on turnover some 23 per cent higher at Pounds 32.3m. Nevertheless, the shares closed 2p lower at 87p. Mr Roger Payton, chairman, said that increased prices by steel producers and lack of any sustained demand from customers were expected again to impact on business in the second half. In the 1992 year the group reported profit of Pounds 1.92m on sales of Pounds 53.5m. Net attributable profit for the half year came out at Pounds 950,000 (Pounds 750,000), giving earnings per share of 3.32p (2.84p). The interim dividend is lifted from 1.25p to 1.3p. Mr Kevin Middis, finance director, said yesterday that the group was not seeing a lack of demand but the high level achieved in 'a very buoyant and positive first quarter' had not been sustained in the second three months. He said the company had gained market share in the north-east of England against stiff competition and was expanding capacity in Yorkshire and Scotland. Mr Middis said analysts were looking for full year pre-tax profits of about Pounds 2.4m to Pounds 2.5m, which he thought was reasonable. He said it was 'extremely difficult to maintain margins at present'. The demand pull was absent, he said. Mr Payton said that a record 90,000 tonnes of steel was supplied to customers, the increase of some 20,000 tonnes representing organic growth.</p>

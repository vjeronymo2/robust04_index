			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Li Zhurun and Yang Xiaohong] </F>   [Text] Beijing, February 7 (XINHUA) -- Scientists at the  China Institute of Atomic Energy (CIAE) have installed a second  beam line on a tandem accelerator.    This advanced achievement, important for research into  astrophysics, has passed appraisal by a committee consisting of  several academicians of the China Academy of Sciences.    According to scientists at the laboratory, tandem  accelerators are being used for research only in a few state  laboratories in the United States and Japan.    The beam line on CIAE's tandem accelerator is China's first.  It has produced two radioactive beams -- known to experts as  "C-11" and "F-17" beams -- for the first time in the country.    This means that it is now possible to do research on  unstable  nuclei far from stability. Previously, nuclear physics was  restricted to examining about 2,000 nuclides produced by ions of  stable isotopes.    This will eventually lead to a better understanding of the  nature of nuclear reactions and the nuclear structure, according  to scientists.    Chinese scientists at the CIAE and elsewhere have conducted  205 experiments using the CIAE's tandem accelerator since 1988.</p>

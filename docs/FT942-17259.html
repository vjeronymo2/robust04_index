			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / Lettuce imports threaten growers Britain's Pounds 160m market in glasshouse production of lettuces and tomatoes is under threat because of the European single market, say growers. Southern European countries such as Spain have been increasingly turning their attention to high-priced northern markets, making it difficult for northern producers reliant on energy-consuming greenhouses to compete. Spanish shipments of iceberg lettuce to Britain are expected to rise by 10,000 tonnes this year to 79,000 tonnes. This compares with only 1,600 tonnes in 1985. Wholesale prices have halved during the past month alone, causing severe financial difficulties for traditional British glasshouse producers. 'We've dumped 20,000 boxes of lettuce at the top of the nursery and just left them to rot,' said Mr Norman Lee, who runs Southgate Growers at Chichester, West Sussex. Mr Lee specialises in supplying during the winter when demand for salads is low, but prices are usually high. This market is now being filled by a flood of low-priced imports, and his receipts have dropped by 25 per cent. Changing tastes have also led consumers to abandon the British round lettuce in favour of more exotic imports. Round lettuces have held their market share in previous years because they have been considerably cheaper than imports, in spite of high energy costs. As Spanish production has expanded, that price differential has been eroded during the past year. Mr Graham Ward, who runs Snaith Salad Growers in Goole, North Humberside, believes Spanish lettuces are being sold below cost to UK supermarkets. 'The Spanish prices are totally unrealistic,' he said. Mr Ward says the break-even price for a box of 12 lettuces, including transport from Spain to the UK and packing costs, would be about Pounds 2.80 to Pounds 3. But boxes of iceberg are being sold at Pounds 1.50. The drop in price has slashed his turnover from a typical Pounds 2.5m a month to Pounds 1m in March. Mr Colin Pickthall, Labour MP for Lancashire West, challenged the government last week to look into the dumping of Spanish lettuce in the UK market. Mr Michael Jack, the junior agriculture minister, replied that if growers could supply evidence of unfair state aid to Spanish producers, he would investigate. Growers say it is difficult to find any decisive evidence of subsidy. But they are infuriated that the vegetable sector should suffer from unalloyed competition when the rest of European agriculture is supported by the common agricultural policy. Mr Derek Crossley, a lettuce grower near Selby, North Yorkshire, says he is struggling to survive because he can only sell three-quarters of what he produces. He said: 'Over the past two years I've invested Pounds 53,000 into the business which we'd put away to retire on, but now we've run out and I think I'm going to go under.'</p>

			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / Foreigners'interest in gold mining sparks row A BATTLE is raging among Russian authorities over whether to allow an unprecedented deal involving foreigners in Russia's previously closed gold mining industry. The government was yesterday said to be nearing a decision as the Russian gold-mining monopoly, Rossalmaz-zoloto, declared that a state monopoly on sales would be maintained to protect prices. Mr Yegor Gaidar, the deputy prime minister responsible for economic reform, has been trying to push through a contract elaborated by Lenzoloto, a Siberian gold producer, covering an area of 105,000 sq metres, together with an Australian consortium called Star Technology Systems. Under the project, Star would obtain a minority stake in a joint stock company - the other shareholders would be Lenzoloto, the Russian government, and the local authorities of the Irkutsk region - in return for a badly needed injection of capital to develop new deposits and reduce waste from existing mining. Star says it has already secured up to Dollars 150m (Pounds 87.2m) in finance for the project. It has begun producing machinery within Russia for alluvial mining. The project, covering all Lenzoloto's mines, provides for all gold produced to be sold to the state, preserving its monopoly on foreign sales. But the plan has run into strong resistance from Mr Valery Rudakov, the powerful Rossalmazzoloto chairman, who said yesterday he wanted to organise a tender for the development of Lenzoloto's prime Sukhoi Log mine - in which his own organisation would be able to compete as 'an equal partner'. Mr Valery Avlov, the general director of Lenzoloto, said he saw no need for a tender, since this would cause delay.</p>

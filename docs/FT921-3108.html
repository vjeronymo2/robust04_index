			<p>920316 FT  16 MAR 92 / Construction Contracts: Paris gardens to be restored The Tuileries Gardens in Paris, neglected for so long they have become little more than a dustbowl flanked by sick trees, are undergoing a FFr250m (Pounds 25.67m) facelift to restore their former glory. Three landscape architects - Jacques Wirtz, Pascal Cribier and Louis Benech  -are working with Mr I M Pei, who is in charge of renovating the neighbouring Louvre museum. The project is due to be completion in 1995. At the launch of the project, Jack Lang, the French culture minister, said: 'We shall be leaving the main avenues, ponds and terraces as they were originally intended, while adding new touches to liven up the back of the gardens (near the Louvre).' The gardens date back to the 15th century but took on their present form under Louis XIV's landscape designer Le Notre in 1664. The Royal Palace of the Tuileries, where Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette lived during the French Revolution in 1789, was burned down during the Paris Commune in 1871.</p>

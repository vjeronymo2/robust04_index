About 500,000 sheep in Scotland, England, Ireland and Wales  are still affected by the fall out from the 1986 explosion.    They plan to fit transmitters to scores of animals so they  can be tracked by satellite wherever they are on the remote  hills and moors. Each back-pack strapped to the sheep contains  a microcomputer, transmitter and receiver.    The packs not only record the sheep's exact position but  also  every jaw movement. Researchers can tell when the animals are  feeding and when they are simply ruminating. The aim is to find  the remaining ``hotspots'' of radiation.    More than 500 UK farms are still subject to movement  restrictions on their flocks almost eight years after the  explosion at the Russian plant.    The worst affected area is Wales where about 230,000 sheep  on  340 farms are affected by legislation preventing their meat from  being sold until they have been checked by government scientists  .    Many sheep, even those born long after the Chernobyl  disaster, are still eating radiocaesium in vegetation growing on  contaminated soil.    Now, after successful trials with a satellite-based Global  Positioning System developed for the U.S. Defence Department,  scientists at the Institute of Grassland and Environmental  Research at Northwyke, Devon and the Institute of Terrestrial  Ecology at Merlewood, Cumbria, are ready to tackle the  contaminated farms.</p>

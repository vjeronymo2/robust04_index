			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agricuture: NZ dairy farmers face disappointing market returns A SHARP fall in the prices on some international dairy markets in recent weeks has cast doubt on the New Zealand Dairy Board's ability to meet this season's target payout to farmers. In May Mr Dryden Spring, the board's chairman, told dairy farmers, in his traditional pre season message, that a payout of NZDollars 5.50 (Pounds 2) per kilogram of milk fat was likely in the year to June 30, 1994. Mr Spring's forecasts are usually cautious, being designed to help farmers plan for the coming year, but this time he appears to have been over-optimistic, a board official indicated yesterday. The May statement was made at a time when the industry was in a buoyant mood following last season's Dollars 5.65 payout, to which was added various dairy company payments of up to NZDollars 1 per kilogram, giving some farmers record returns. But the market situation has not lived up to expectations. The price for butter has stayed in the doldrums, and there has been a sharp weakening in the value of whole milk powder. Much of the present problem centres on currency difficulties, which are inhibiting trade in most dairy commodities except cheese, the official said. Of particular concern is the fall in European currencies against the US dollar, in which much of the world's dairy trade is carried out, and this situation has been worseed by the recent strong rise in the value of the New Zealand dollar against the US currency. The board has warned farmers that the high level of optimism in the New Zealand industry, which is leading to high prices for both stock and farmland, does not take account of what it hopes will be short term pressures in the international market. The official said it was unlikely that there would be an early lift in butter prices and there were question marks over the price for milk powder, of which New Zealand hopes to sell 320,000 tonnes abroad this season, twice the amount produced just four years ago. He said that demand for New Zealand cheese was holding up well, adding: 'It really is the glamour product of the moment. . .World demand for cheese - especially the consistent type New Zealand produces - is growing strongly'. He pointed out that there were few convenience foods that did not rely on cheese to some extent - whether they be pizzas, McDonald's cheeseburgers or Mexican or pasta dishes. In addition there was a strong demand from manufacturers of TV dinners and the like. The official said that the effects of the sharp drop in international butter and milk powder prices would have been much more severe a decade ago, when New Zealand produced a relatively narrow range of commodities in bulk form. Now about 70 per cent of the country's dairy products were exported in consumer-ready form, he said, which helped to 'soften the blow' of ups and downs in the international market.</p>

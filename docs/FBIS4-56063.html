			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Debate between Gyula Horn, leading Hungarian Socialist </F> Party candidate, and Gabor Kuncze, leading candidate for the  Alliance of Free Democrats, in the studio in Budapest; moderated  by an unidentified announcer -- live]    [Excerpts] [Announcer] Good evening, viewers. We are  broadcasting a special edition of the election series, which  presents party opinions. We have invited those heading the  lists of the parties that were most successful in the first  round of the elections. I greet here in the studio Gyula Horn,  heading the list of the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP], and  Gabor Kuncze, who heads the list of the Alliance of Free  Democrats [SZDSZ]. [passage omitted]    [Announcer] Let us speak about the economy. [passage  omitted]  You have said that if you come to power, there will be no need  for a 100-day grace period. I imagine you were hinting at  economic issues. [passage omitted]    [Kuncze] I say there is no need for 100 days of grace  because  in my opinion the next government will have to take action  immediately. Of course, this is not separate from the fact that  it is necessary to be familiar with the situation that the next  government will inherit. We also are of the firm opinion that a  very detailed coalition agreement must be concluded because only  on this basis will it be possible to coordinate positions in the  future, to prepare a legislative program, to organize government  work, and to ensure that there is a stable coalition behind the  government. [passage omitted]    [Horn] Allow me to continue what Gabor Kuncze began. In my  view, at the same time coalition talks are held it will be  necessary to gain an idea of the country's situation, to gain an  idea of what legacy awaits the new government. [passage omitted]  Only then -- on the basis of chapters such as the coalition  agreement conditions consisting not just of economic matters but  constitutional matters and others -- will it be possible to  define the most urgent tasks that must be accomplished by the  end of 1994. Last, but not least, the next government must  differ from the current one in that much should be done to  simplify bureaucracy. This would facilitate the greater influx  of working capital, which would facilitate ventures, and other.  [passage omitted]    [Announcer] You emphasize an active economic policy. What  measures do you intend to take?    [Kuncze] After a possible coalition agreement has been  reached, after the conditions have been created for more  effective government and parliamentary work, and after the legal  amendments have been passed, there could be a need in 1994 for a  supplementary budget. It is necessary to set to work immediately  on amending the laws that regulate privatization. [passage  omitted] The same applies to the legal package that regulates  agriculture; it is necessary in this case to create a  satisfactory system of market information, a satisfactory credit  system, a system of support that can be used more effectively  than now. Politics must withdraw from the villages and it must  leave those involved in agriculture to work on the basis of  their own knowledge and interests.    Remaining with the subject of 1994 -- the package of laws on  self-government must be amended so that those running in the  local elections can do so in accordance with the new conditions.  The education laws ought to be reviewed. By way of example, we  feel that the system of university tuition fees cannot be  introduced beginning in September. Something must be done in  connection with the question of the national curriculum.    In the second half of 1994 the parliament will have to enact  amendments to the legislation on taxation. I am thinking here  of tax reductions, tax concessions, and amendments of  regulations to encourage investments, which will come into force  as of 1 January 1995. The National Assembly this year will have  to adopt the budget for 1995. [passage omitted]    Our opinion is that the proportions will have to turned  around; greater emphasis must be placed on preparation of the  laws, and the parliament, by working more effectively, must be  able to enact the laws more quickly. [passage omitted]    [Announcer] Both of you have mentioned social  responsiveness. It has particularly been stressed by Gyula  Horn. [passage omitted] It is obvious that the trade unions  might have a determining role. What is your opinion about this?  Will this trade union interest succeed within the traditional  and desirable interest coordination mechanism, or within the  parliament, through a certain kind of trade union faction within  the MSZP?    [Kuncze] The SZDSZ regards interest coordination -- both  with  employees and employers -- as a very important issue. In this  respect, naturally, we accept the trade unions as partners. We  also accept this certain social agreement with the interest  representation organizations [referring to the MSZP's proposal],  not without any reason, because this proposal was also included  in the SZDSZ's crisis management program issued in 1991.  [passage omitted]    However, this cannot happen in any way other than outside  parliament, because the essence of this is that these agreements  then have to be approved by parliament. Parliament, naturally,  has an opportunity to exercise control over these agreements.  We are not talking about automatic mechanisms here.  Parliament's authority will remain in this respect. However,  because the leaders of the largest trade unions will enter  parliament on the MSZP's list, there is a danger that these  interest coordination mechanisms will take place within the  party, or perhaps within the MSZP's parliamentary group of  deputies, and not in public.    We would not approve of this. We are in favor of openness in  this respect. We accept and approve of this coordination  outside parliament, with the involvement of the government and  the trade unions. This certain economic-social agreement has to  be reached with these conditions, and the widest possible range  of questions should be included in this debate.    [Horn] This is a perpetual debate between us. [passage  omitted] Assuming that the SZDSZ also wants a social market  economy, it is obvious that the social partnership cannot be  established without the trade unions. [passage omitted]    Another point is that the MSZP -- within or outside the  party  -- will not conclude any kind of pact with players in society  which is not made public. Therefore, if we have any kind of  stance in connection with the trade unions, or in connection  with the earlier mentioned economic-social agreement, it will be  entirely public. The SZDSZ will be informed about it as well as  anyone else and the public. That is entirely true.    The third element -- forgive me for saying it -- that six of  the 176 individual candidates running in MSZP colors were from  the leadership of the National Federation of Hungarian Trade  Unions, will not determine the Socialist Party's policy. I  hope, however, that they will influence it. The party, which  has had good relations with the representatives of trade unions  for years, has an advantageous position. [passage omitted]    The Hungarian trade unions do not come up with impossible  demands that cannot be fulfilled. They support all their  demands with professional arguments. [passage omitted]    [Kuncze] I have to argue with you a certain point. I have to  repeat that the interest coordination process has to take place  outside parliament; it is a governmental task. I agree with you  that the law on legislation has to be amended in this respect;  the trade unions' rights have to be included. However, I would  not consider it desirable if these coordination talks were also  carried out within the parliament. It is the government's  responsibility to conclude and observe these agreements.  [passage omitted]    [Announcer] Forty-five minutes have passed. There remains  a very important question -- foreign policy. What role should  the ethnic Hungarians living as minorities have in our relations  with neighboring countries in drafting the basic treaties?    [Horn] In our view a basic treaty proclaims two fundamental  points: One is the inviolability of borders, while -- closely  connected with this -- the other is the full guarantee of the  rights of the national minorities, the Hungarians, living there.  That is one thing.    The other thing is that we naturally would coordinate the  conclusion of such a treaty with the political interest  representation organizations of the ethnic Hungarians living in  the given country -- whether the country in question is Slovakia  or Romania.    My conviction is that what the MSZP (?says), that there  should be historical reconciliation with neighbors, is  unavoidable. The sooner we do this, the sooner we try to  realize this in practice, the better. One can proclaim an  awareness of our mission, one can say a lot about historical  grievances -- this will not lead anywhere. The sooner there is  national consensus on the question of the necessity of  historical reconciliation and, on the basis of this, on the need  for an active relationship-building policy, the sooner we will  be able to sort out our relationships and the sooner our country  will become more secure.    I assert that we will be able to assist more the situation  of  Hungarians living in the given country.    [Announcer] I am also curious about the opinion of the  SZDSZ.    [Kuncze] I agree that the basic treaties can be concluded  only if on the other side, the satisfactory guarantees exist for  the assertion of the minority rights of the Hungarians beyond  the border. The problem is that because of this, it is very  difficult to make progress in the conclusion of basic treaties.  For this reason we also place emphasis on the need to take  concrete, practical steps in every case when the opportunity  arises -- whether it is an economic matter, whether it is the  opening of a university or an educational issue, or the issue of  bilingualism, or other issues.    We emphasize the necessity of maintaining this dialogue.  Otherwise these basic treaties are, indeed, important, and they  should be concluded on the broadest possible bases. This is our  political interest as well, because we can enter an integrated  Europe only with settled relations with our neighbors. It is  also our economic interest, because we could perhaps have  markets there. If the economies of those countries improve, this  will give rise to a suitable improvement for Hungarians beyond  the border.    Until then, the Hungarian Government must handle this area  with special importance. From here, we do not have to say how  the organizations of the Hungarians beyond the borders should  conduct their political activities. It is up to them to shape  their politics. The Hungarian Government in power must accept  what they have shaped, and it must always ask for the opinion of  the organizations of the Hungarians beyond the border concerning  the fostering of relations with neighboring countries.    Our interest is that they should seek their expectations  where they were born, and that is where they should live a  satisfactory existence. Allow me to add something: Our  integration into Europe is important not just for us, but for  neighboring countries as well. This will make those borders one  line on the map, and this question will no longer be one that is  subject to dispute.    [Announcer] A brief question in conclusion: How many seats  do you feel you have a realistic chance of getting? Mr Horn?    [Horn] It is very difficult to predict, and I do not like to  predict. I imagine about 170-180 seats.    [Announcer] Mr. Kuncze?    [Kuncze] We earlier aimed at repeating, at the minimum, our  performance in 1990. That means about 90-100 seats in the next  parliament.    [Announcer] Thank you for coming to the studio.</p>

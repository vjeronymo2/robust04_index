			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / London Stock Exchange: Shares steady as trading volume falls THE LONDON stock market settled down for its pre-Christmas run yesterday, when share prices moved within a narrow range in reduced trading volume. The new equity trading account, extended to cover the Christmas holiday break, takes the market up to the year-end, and investors showed little inclination to chase prices any higher in the final weeks of 1992. The outcome of the European Community summit meeting in Edinburgh last weekend was received favourably but without any great enthusiasm. Some renewed profit-taking selling at the opening of the session was checked by initial firmnness in stock index futures, but even this optimistic signal soon faded away. The FT-SE Index dipped 6.4 to 2,709.8 in early trading but quickly turned higher when the December contract on the Footsie made a firm start in the stock index sector. The index moved up sharply, reaching the day's high of 2,726.1 within half-an-hour. Then the enthusiasm in the futures sector melted away and equities spent the rest of the trading session 'quiet but firm'. An early gain of 9 Dow points on Wall Street found only a cautious response in London. The final reading put the FT-SE Index at 2,721.8 for an improvement on the day of 5.6 points. Confidence in any further lasting advance in equities this year appeared to be fading yesterday as City institutions turned their attention to portfolio-dressing operations ahead of the year-end. Credit Lyonnais Laing, the London-based securities house, reiterated its view that the Footsie will finish the year at 2,700, but forecast a 1993 year-end of 3,100. Seaq-reported trading volume was down to 438.4m shares from Friday's 692.7m; on Friday, retail or customer business volume, at Pounds 1.40bn, remained well in the higher range of turnover recorded over the past two months. But the fall in Seaq volume yesterday suggested that genuine investment activity has begun to die away ahead of the market's Christmas break, which this year will effectively extend over two weeks However, there was some caution expressed yesterday that the stock market could react sharply to this week's list of economic data which opens this morning with the UK producer price statistics. Last weekend brought hints of impending widespread workforce redundancies across Europe by leading car makers and there were new hints in the City of London yesterday of similar cutbacks in the securities trading industry. This week will also bring a survey of business opinion from the Confederation of British Industry and the latest data on domestic money supply; neither are expected to bring much comfort for investors, although both will be examined eagerly for indications of the economic recovery on which the stock market is pinning its faith. With sterling quiet on the foreign exchange markets, the blue chip international stocks lacked a general trend, and movements among the pharmaceuticals resulted in just a handful of irregular price changes. Retail issues, now approaching the Christmas selling season which provides the bulk of the year's profits, held firm but buyers were cautious and very selective.</p>

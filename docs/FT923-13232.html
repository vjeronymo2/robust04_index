			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / Judicial review is 'doomed to failure' AN EFFORT by dissident Lloyd's Names to seek a judicial review of the insurance market is 'doomed to failure', Mr Gordon Pollock QC said in the High Court yesterday. Mr Pollock, representing Lloyd's, told the two judges presiding in the case  -Mr Justice Popplewell and Mr Justice Leggatt - that the market was 'not subject to public law'. Lloyd's applied for leave to set aside a motion from six Names seeking a judicial review in May. The application is the subject of the present case. Judicial reviews are actions against public or semi-public bodies alleged to have failed to observe their duties. The Names are members of loss-making Gooda Walker syndicates. They contend that by permitting a series of cash calls to go ahead Lloyd's has not met its obligations to advance and protect the interests of its members. Mr Pollock said that the interests of policyholders must be paramount. The case continues today.</p>

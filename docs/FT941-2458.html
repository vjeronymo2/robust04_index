			<p>940321 FT  21 MAR 94 / Management: An African adventure - A Lincolnshire businessman tells Leslie Crawford of his travails in Kenya When Eddie Arnold's international trading company went bankrupt in the late 1980s, he decided to take his knowledge of the food business abroad. Kenya's thriving horticultural industry seemed a good place to make a fresh start. Arnold knew the country well, as it was one of the main suppliers of dehydrated vegetables for his UK clients. Deliveries, however, had become erratic, and Arnold seized the opportunity to go and sort the problem out. Before he knew it, he was taking over the management of a state-owned vegetable processing plant. Three years later, Arnold has survived crop failures, the evaporation of bank loans, and the loss of a financial partner. He fought to rescue the state-owned factory from receivership, but was evicted when he fell behind with the rent. He recently convinced the Kenyan government to give him back the lease. Arnold certainly got more than he bargained for in the quest for dehydrated vegetables. Did he under-estimate the complexities of operating in an African environment? The Lincolnshire businessman, now 41, confesses that he was seduced by a proposition few western businessmen in Africa can resist: the challenge of turning round an ailing commercial venture whose only handicap is its state-owned parentage. Across the continent, African governments are under pressure from the World Bank and other creditors to divest from their sprawling progeny. But because public companies are in such poor shape, privatising management has proved to be a convenient half-way house on the road to full-scale privatisation. Foreign investors gain country experience with little or no capital risk, while the government is freed from the day-to-day running of corporations. For the growing number of foreign managers taking charge of hotels, fishing companies, bottling plants and textile mills in Africa, a management contract looks like a risk-free gamble: minimum capital outlays ensure a big slice of the profits. Or do they? As Arnold was to find out, it takes more than a pioneering spirit to survive as a businessman in Africa. When he first arrived, his intention was to work with Pan Vegetable Processors' management and its contract farmers to ensure a smooth delivery of export orders for his clients in Europe. The orders for dehydrated vegetables were worth millions of dollars at a time. Arnold realised that the para-statal's problem was that it was chronically short of cash. 'I encountered a lack of management skills, the usual fiddles, and the fact that farmers were not being paid,' Arnold recalls. 'No money, no product - it was a simple as that.' Arnold decided to advance Pan Vegetables some working capital, which produced its magical effect: the factory suddenly had a steady supply of fresh vegetables to process for export. For a while, everything went swimmingly, with satisfied customers in Europe and a factory operating under full steam in Kenya. But in 1992, Kenya's state holding company, the Industrial and Commercial Development Corp, placed Pan Vegetable Processors into receivership. 'I knew I could turn it into a profitable operation,' Arnold says. So in October 1992, he negotiated a three-year lease for the plant. Then drought struck. Throughout 1993, a merciless sun beat down on the rich farmland of Kenya's Great Rift Valley. Farmers around Lake Naivasha, where the factory is located, lost 80 per cent of their crop. Arnold lost his supply of fresh vegetables, as well as Pounds 200,000 invested in seeds and fertilisers for his farmers. To make matters worse, Kenya was in the middle of a severe credit squeeze and Arnold's pleas for emergency working capital fell on deaf ears. His money dried up, he fell behind on his rent and discovered one day that he had been locked out of Pan Vegetables. Arnold suspects there may have been an ulterior motive for the lockout. The factory is an attractive asset, not least because it sits on 200 acres of prime farmland in a land-hungry country. When the government's Parastatal Reform Committee decided the company should be privatised, Arnold suddenly became an inconvenient sitting tenant. His financial difficulties gave the authorities an excuse to break the three-year lease agreement. However, squabbles between the Industrial and Commercial Development Corp and the Parastatal Reform Committee have delayed Pan Vegetable's privatisation. Samson Juma, ICDC's top legal officer, admits that there is a 'tug of war' between the two state organs over who should be in charge of Kenya's privatisation programme. While the struggle continues, Arnold has the factory on a renewable one-month lease, which makes any long-term planning difficult, not to say impossible. After much knocking on doors, he has obtained some working capital from Middle Africa Investments, a local firm of financial advisers, and he hopes he can hang on to Pan Vegetables until mid-year, when a new harvest might allow him to recover his original outlays. Arnold hopes to make a bid for the factory when it comes up for sale. If he were offered another management contract, however, he would avoid his original mistakes: he says he badly underestimated the amount of working capital he would need - a complaint often heard among first-time businessmen in Africa. He negotiated too short a lease on the factory, and was let down by local partners who did not fulfil their financial commitments. Even gambling in Africa, it appears, requires far-sighted planning.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Sofia, February 21 (BTA) -- A delegation of the  Russian Parliament, led by Ivan Rybkin, chairman of the State  Duma, met with Bulgarian National Assembly Chairman Aleksandur  Yordanov this morning. The delegation arrived here on Saturday  [19 February] on the first visit of Russian Duma members abroad.    Mr. Yordanov and Mr. Rybkin discussed the development of  relations between Bulgaria and Russia and their economic crisis.    "We discussed the crisis in Bosnia and agreed that it can  only be settled by peaceful means," Mr. Rybkin told reporters  after the meeting. "All sanctions against former Yugoslavia  which hinder our two countries' economies should be lifted," he  said. "I familiarized Mr. Rybkin with Bulgaria's principled and  invariable position of neutrality in the current complicated  situation in ex- Yugoslavia. I also told him that for two years  now Bulgaria has been calling on all countries in the Balkans to  refrain from involvement in the Yugoconflict," the head of the  Bulgarian Parliament said. "We assessed NATO's ultimatum as a  means for faster settlement of the conflict, and the differences  in our stands are minor," Mr. Yordanov added.    Later in the day, the Russian MP's discussed bilateral  relations and the Yugocrisis at successive meetings with M.P's  of the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP), the Union of Democratic  Forces (SDS), the ethnic Turks' Movement for Rights and Freedoms  (DPS) and the New Union for Democracy (formed by expellees or  breakways from the parliamentary SDS).    BSP floor leader Nora Ananieva described the meeting as a  beginning of contacts between the two parliaments in the light  of a general tendency towards a left and left-of-centre  orientation of East European countries, the Parliamentary Press  Centre announced after the meeting. According to BSP leader  Zhan Videnov, the Russian delegation's visit is part of the  active policy which Russia has been pursuing in the Balkans.  BSP believes Russia's decisive interference to prevent further  escalation of the conflict was not accidental and could be  viewed as a serious success, crowning the several months'  efforts of Russian foreign policy, Mr. Videnov told reporters  after the meeting. "The Yugoembargo should not stand in the way  of the peace process in former Yugoslavia. If the peace process  gets an impetus, in the next few days we will have to reconsider  the positive and possibly negative effects of the embargo. This  does not concern the arms embargo which by all means should be  kept against all warring parties," Mr. Videnov said, commenting  on Mr. Rybkin's opinion on lifting the embargo against former  Yugoslavia. Mr. Videnov announced that a delegation of the  Bulgarian Socialist Party will visit Moscow in a week's time to  meet Russian left-wing parties.    The parliamentary SDS set forth its position in favour of  Bulgaria's independent foreign policy based on two priorities:  Integration into the European structures and policy in the  Balkans, stressing that the time of Balkan axes and blocs has  gone, said Asparukh Panov MP of the SDS, chief Bulgarian  delegate to the Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly. "We  expressed our satisfaction with the demilitarization of Sarajevo  and congratulated our guests on Russia's active diplomatic  interference in the last few days, which contributed to the  success of NATO's ultimatum," Mr. Panov added. Asked if  Bulgarian MP's sitting in the CE [Council of Europe]  Parliamentary Assembly would support Russia's application for  membership in the CE, Mr. Panov said that Russia is a major  factor in the European processes but should meet some  requirements to qualify for full membership in the CE, mainly  concerning human and minority rights.    Conferring with members of the Parliamentary DPS, Mr. Rybkin  stressed that the members of the State Duma support President  Yeltsin in his efforts towards peaceful settlement of the  conflict in Bosnia, DPS spokesman Yunal Lyutfi said after the  meeting. DPS MP's have been formally invited by Mr. Rybkin to  visit the Russian Duma.</p>

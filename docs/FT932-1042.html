			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / People: Publisher puts finance on board Dorling Kindersley, the publisher of highly illustrated reference books, has appointed its first board-level finance director eight months after its spectacular debut on the Stock Exchange. He is Peter Gill, 37, group development director and company secretary of Abbott Mead Vickers, the listed advertising agency. Gill, who spent 10 years with Arthur Andersen, the chartered accountants, will also act as DK's company secretary. The publisher's finance function has until now been headed by Lyn Blackman, who sat on the board only as company secretary. She will be moving to a three-day week, and working on new business development. Richard Harman, DK's managing director, said Gill's services had been secured after a 'gentle search' by headhunters. No one had questioned the absence of a finance director on the board during the flotation process - partly, no doubt, because both he and Rod Hare, DK's operations director, were chartered accountants. DK's shares have risen more than 75 per cent since flotation.</p>

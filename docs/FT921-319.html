			<p>920330 FT  30 MAR 92 / International Company News: IBM Japan slides 32% to Y56.5bn IBM Japan, the Japanese subsidiary of the world's largest computer company, has reported a 33 per cent decline in pre-tax profits last year, to Y103.5bn (Dollars 784.1m). IBM blamed weak sales of computer hardware in the face of an economic slowdown that caused many customers to delay equipment purchases. Sales were down to Y1,272.1bn from Y1,326.5bn. Domestic sales were off by 6.8 per cent to Y903.8bn Export revenues rose 3.3 per cent. After-tax earnings were off 32 per cent to Y56.48bn. As part of the worldwide restructuring of the IBM group, IBM Japan has been shifting its focus away from the hardware side. The company said sales of software, services, and system integration continued to grow.</p>

			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / International Company News: Cinderella of steel causes a scene - Klockner's return to form could be embarrassing Klockner Stahl, the Cinderella of the German steel industry, is back in the black as a viable, profitable integrated steel plant, thanks to a drastic reduction in its debt burden, and harsh job cuts. That was the potentially embarrassing message yesterday from Mr Hans Christoph von Rohr, chief executive of Klockner-Werke, the parent company, on the eve of tough negotiations between the European steel industry and the European commission in Brussels. It is embarrassing to both sides, because they urgently need to agree on further sharp capacity cuts in European steel production. Closing the Klockner plant in Bremen appears to many of the rival producers as the ideal solution. Mr von Rohr, the elegant but ruthless architect of the plant's survival plan, disagrees. 'Klockner Stahl in Bremen is making profits right now,' he said. 'If we have overcapacity in Europe, by closing one plant we must improve the average cost situation in the European steel industry. By closing one of the best-performing plants, we won't improve the average at all. We will make it worse. 'Bremen is in the top group of European plants, especially of the German steel plants.' This is the argument that Mr von Rohr will put, against strong objections by fellow steel producers such as Mr Brian Moffat, chairman and chief executive of British Steel, at next week's negotiations in Brussels. The secret of his success, he says, lies in the composition proceedings  - the last step before bankruptcy in the German financial process - declared by Klockner-Werke for its steel operations last year. These not only halved the debt burden carried by the steel plants, but quickly rationalised the operations. 'Under the whip of the composition proceedings, we were able to re-engineer that company more profoundly and much more quickly than our competitors,' Mr von Rohr said. In the first place, the workforce will have been reduced by one third - from 6,000 to 4,000 - by the end of June. Capacity at the plant will be cut by 500,000 tonnes, to 2.7m tonnes, with the closure of one blast furnace. The estimated annual saving on the wage bill is more than DM40m (Dollars 22.7m). Secondly, the company forced Ruhrkohle, Germany's dominant coal and coke producer, to sell 30 per cent of its coke requirements - 300,000 tonnes a year - on the much cheaper international market, saving roughly the same amount as the job cuts. And the creditors' agreement to write off half the company's debt, which once stood at DM2.7bn for all its steel operations, will save more than DM70m in a full year. Additional savings have come from the opening of direct deliveries of iron ore and coke to the Bremen plant, and from the full operation of its modern Bregal zinc galvanising plant. 'Instead of having a loss of more than DM160m, which was the rate it was running at in the last quarter of our last financial year, we will have a profit of around DM70m,' said Mr von Rohr. 'Nobody has realised how quickly things have changed at Klockner, or else they have simply tried to suppress the thought. Klockner Stahl was the Cinderella of the German steel industry. In the meantime, it has become quite an attractive and self-confident dancing partner.' Earlier this month, Klockner signed the contracts for its rescue plan, as negotiated with the Bremen city state. It leaves Klockner-Werke with an interest of just 33 per cent, while Hibeg, the Bremen government's industrial holding company, has 32 per cent. Stadt werke Bremen, the city power utility, has 13 per cent, the Bremer Vulkan shipyard 13 per cent, and the Hegemann shipyard group 8 per cent. Negotiations are continuing with Sidmar, the Belgian subsidiary of the Arbed steel group, to take a 25 per cent stake, and so reduce Klockner's own exposure to 25 per cent. 'We are in very detailed talks,' Mr von Rohr said. 'There is a very positive drive in the negotiations. We are not at the point yet of being able to say if they will join.' The new partners have injected capital of DM250m, and the question, being investigated by the European Commission, is whether that cash involves a subsidy by the Bremen state. Mr von Rohr insists it amounts to a purely commercial decision to invest in a viable operation. 'We feel perfectly relaxed,' he said. 'The question can be answered with the figures. Bremen is simply doing what a reasonable private investor would do. 'It should be obvious to anybody that a company able to make a profit even in the present disastrous conditions of the steel market is a good investment.'</p>

			<p>930809 FT  09 AUG 93 / People: Alistair Mitchell-Innes joins Sidney Banks Alistair Mitchell-Innes, former chief executive of Isosceles, is becoming non-executive director and chairman designate of Sidney Banks, the Bedfordshire grain and agriculture specialist. The current chairman, John Burr, who has been in the position since 1980 and is 75 years old, wants to retire in January next year. 'We are not looking for someone to transform our debt situation because we have not got one,' says Richard Banks, joint managing director, when asked about Mitchell-Innes's two years at the heavily-indebted supermarket operator Isosceles. 'Alistair has wide experience in food manufacturing and that is the direction in which our company is moving.' He has chief executive of Nabisco Group between 1985 and 1989. Sidney Banks has recently acquired a rice-milling operation as well as a company that trades in spices and coffee. Mitchell-Innes is also deputy chairman of HP Bulmer and a non-executive director of Next and Evans Halshaw.</p>

			<p><P> February 17, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> RAMONA DOES TURNAROUND IN SECOND HALF TO BEAT SAN MARCOS  </P> <P> The girls' basketball game between Ramona and San Marcos Thursday night evolved  into something resembling "Invasion of the Body Snatchers."  </P> <P> "It was like we were two different teams out there," Ramona's Kris Miller said  after Ramona stormed back from a 29-9 halftime deficit to defeat sixth-ranked  San Marcos, the Avocado League champion, 51-44.  </P> <P> "All week," Miller said, "we were saying, 'We're not going to let San Marcos go  undefeated in league.' "  </P> <P> But visiting Ramona (18-3, 12-2) came painfully close to missing deadline on  the assignment.  </P> <P> San Marcos came out in the first half and denied Ramona the chance to shoot,  rebound, pass and score, taking a 13-6 first-quarter lead and extending it in  the second.  </P> <P> "We were just comatose in the first half," said Miller, who was held scoreless  before halftime but came alive, along with her teammates, after a brutal  halftime talk by Ramona Coach Joe Bess to finish with 14 points.  </P> <P> "He usually never yells at us," Miller said. "But we've never been down by that  much, either."  </P> <P> San Marcos (18-6, 13-1) was already assured of the league championship after  Tuesday's victory over Oceanside, which at the time was tied for second place  with Ramona.  </P> <P> San Marcos' Suzie O'Brien, the county's leading scorer at just under 30 points  a game, was effective in the first half, scoring 15 points and pulling down  eight rebounds. But as the game wore on, Ramona chipped away at the Knights'  lead and that effectiveness.  </P> <P> O'Brien scored just 11 points (with two field goals) in the second half. Four  of her seven second-half free throws came after Ramona had taken a 47-38 lead,  cutting the deficit to 47-42.  </P> <P> Ramona took its first lead -- 39-38 -- with 4:26 remaining on Miller's shot off  her own rebound. The Bulldogs scored then eight more points in a row to end a  15-0 run.  </P> <P> "It's so hard when you kill them in the first half," O'Brien said. "I don't  know what happened. Nothing fell, and they played a great defensive game."  </P> <P> Ramona slowed San Marcos with a second-half full-court press after playing  man-to-man defense in the first half.  </P> <P> "They handled our press," Bess said, "but we were able to get control of the  tempo."

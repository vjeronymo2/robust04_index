			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Liquidation for Belling as trade creditors fight unusual contest LIQUIDATORS were appointed yesterday to Belling, the cooker manufacturer which collapsed in May, after an unusual contest between groups of trade creditors. Buchler Phillips and Touche Ross were elected joint liquidators with the support of some creditors and the Belling pension fund. The opponents, which had backed Cork Gully and Robson Rhodes, are seeking to limit claims against the estate by the pension fund, whose current trustees are seeking Pounds 8m. The creditors argued during a four-hour meeting yesterday that a portion of the pension scheme claim may be dubious and consequently should not be granted full voting rights. The pension scheme was allowed to vote Pounds 6.9m of its Pounds 8m claim, according to Mr David Buchler, partner at Buchler Phillips. This appears to have been crucial to Buchler's and Touche's election. The former trustees of the pension scheme, Mr Richard Belling and Mr Michael Stewart - chairman and finance director of Belling respectively - have been served with writs by the current trustees, Law Debenture Corporation. The writs seek the return of Pounds 2.1m representing a payment from the fund authorised by the trustees to a Staffordshire-based solicitor Mr Charles Deacon, intended as an advance for a Dollars 50m loan to Belling itself. Also, a total of Pounds 5.5m is claimed in connection with the pension fund's acquisition of a subsidiary of Belling. Touche Ross, told creditors yesterday they might receive no more than 10p in the pound from the liquidation. A severance claim by employees - many of whom are owed holiday pay and some wages - was being examined by the liquidators, Touche Ross said. The pension fund, represented by The Law Debenture Trust, is seeking to receive at least Pounds 2m of its Pounds 8m claim directly rather than as a dividend from the general fund. However, trade creditors are anxious that all claims should be treated equally. This forms part of their argument against the appointment of liquidators supported by the pension scheme's trust-ees. 'The fund is competing for the return of Pounds 2m and we feel it needs an independent examination of whether that should be spread among other creditors', said Mr David Cooke, a solicitor representing some 70 creditors owed about Pounds 8m. 'The liquidator should not be seen to have been elected on the reliance of the pension fund votes.'</p>

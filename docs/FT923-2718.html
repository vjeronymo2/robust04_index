			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / International Company News: Fried. Krupp and Hoesch face fresh merger obstacle FRIED. Krupp and Hoesch, the two large Ruhr-based steel and engineering groups, yesterday vowed to press ahead with practical steps towards a merger despite a court ruling which has created a last-minute legal obstacle to the long-planned fusion of the two groups. The two companies, which have spent most of this year successfully clearing legal hurdles in the way of a merger one after another, announced yesterday that a Dortmund court had refused to register the application for the merger, as required under German company law for the transaction to take final effect. This decision - which follows a legal challenge to the merger launched by three individual shareholders in Hoesch - was dismissed by the companies as a legal techni-cality. They said that they would appeal against the ruling as soon as possible and proceed with all the organisational preparations for a merger. Despite the companies' insistence that the judgment will not lead to a serious delay in the practical implementation of the merger, it is inevitable that plans for the listing of the merged company on the German stock-exchange will be held up. The original plan was to seek such a listing this month or next, but it now looks likely that the flotation will be postponed until later this year. The basis of the Dortmund court's ruling is that it does not have the competence to evaluate the legal basis of the claims lodged by the three shareholders, Mr Henry-August-Robert Nold of Darm-stadt, Mr Hans-Gerhard Haas of Dortmund, both private investors, and Mr Hans Kluting, a lawyer based in Dortmund who previously spent 38 years working at Hoesch. A date for a hearing in the Dortmund regional court has been set for December 18. Their concerns are thought to focus on the treatment of minority shareholders under the terms of the merger agreement, although Mr Kluting has complained bitterly that the name of Hoesch will not be given enough prominence after the merger. Technically, the the merged company will be called 'Fried. Krupp AG Hoesch-Krupp'. Hoesch shareholders voted 99.7 per cent in favour of the merger at an annual general meeting this July.</p>

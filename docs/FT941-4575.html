			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / International Company News: Ghanaian goldfield stake sale ratified Ghana's parliament has unanimously ratified four agreements on the sale of part of the government's shares in Ashanti Goldfields (AGC), Reuter reports from Accra. The mines and energy minister, Mr Richard Kwame Peprah, said the ratification was the last hurdle before the sale went ahead. The government intends to sell 5 per cent of AGC shares on the local stock exchange and 20 per cent on the London market to raise Dollars 250m for development projects. AGC is currently 55 per cent state-owned, with Lonrho L, holding 45 per cent of shares. Seeking to allay Ghanaian fears that the sale was against the national interest, Mr Peprah said new laws made it impossible for anyone to take a controlling stake in a Ghanaian mining company without government approval. The agreement states that neither Lonrho nor the government may sell any more shares within two years and that both must undertake not to increase their percentage holding after the flotation, he said. Shares may be bought by institutions and individuals resident in Ghana and other countries of the Economic Community of West African States, and by Ghanaians living elsewhere. Finance Minister Kwesi Botchway said part of the money from the sale would be put into a revolving fund to promote local business and boost national reserves.</p>

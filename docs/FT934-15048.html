			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / FT Exporter (23): Changing attitudes - Jeremy Miles believes that, despite new EC directives resistance to pan-European buying will continue - Procurement / Profile of Quasar JEREMY MILES is a strong supporter of the European Commission's efforts to open up the public procurement market. But he is also extremely thankful for the fact that Quasar Microwave Technology, the company of which he is chairman, operates in a market where there are no obvious 'national champions'. Quasar makes wave guides, hollow metal conductors which carry microwave signals to and from radar and telecommunications antennae. It faces competition from manufacturers in Italy, Germany and France, as well as from the US, but the sector is too specialised to prompt governments to defend large national suppliers. Quasar, which is based in Heathfield, near Exeter, Devon, has turnover of Pounds 3m and a workforce of 100 people. Established in 1985, it made some over-ambitious acquisitions, says Mr Miles. He joined the company 18 months ago at the request of the company's institutional investors to help sort out its problems. Europe can no longer afford to have one and sometimes even two or three domestic champions in each member state, particularly in high technology areas, he says. 'Deals will continue to be done on the golf course but the public procurement directives represent an attempt to coerce the member states to stop thinking of their public authorities and their utilities as political tools.' Quasar sells 60 per cent of its turnover in continental Europe either directly to public authorities and utilities or to the main contractors involved in projects. Mr Miles calculates that his company manages to convert half of what he calls 'qualified enquiries' into firm orders. In spite of his welcome for the EC directives, Mr Miles believes that it will take some time before ingrained attitudes are changed. 'New generations will grow up to regard pan-European buying as utterly normal but for the time being there will be resistance,' he says. In addition, many suppliers may be reluctant to attempt to break into new markets because they have become so used to them being closed to foreign manufacturers. 'Most of us have had to husband our resources and look for softer targets. But we have to break the mould.' The new timetables for publishing details of tenders are of symbolic rather than practical significance, he believes. By the time a tender appears in the Official Journal it is probably already too late, he says. Suppliers will only win new business if they get to know their customers and their likely requirements well in advance. And even then a purchaser is unlikely to entrust an order for important equipment to an unknown supplier. Initial orders are likely to be small until the supplier has proved it can deliver a reliable product.</p>

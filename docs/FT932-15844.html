			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / Government Bonds: Rate-cut expectations provide the spur for European rally EUROPEAN government bond markets rallied on rumours that several European central banks may announce a co-ordinated round of interest rate cuts shortly. German government bonds gained a quarter point on the day, despite initial disappointment over the Bundesbank's repo result. The Bundesbank cut the minimum interest rate on two-week securities repurchase funds from 8.17 per cent to 8.13 per cent, with a net drain of funds from the system. Dealers said bunds fell back on the news as the market was disappointed by the small size of the Bundesbank's cut. The Liffe bund future contract, which opened at 95.90, fell back to 95.71 but then rallied to reach a high of 96.15 as investors bought across the range of maturities. Dealers said buying was sparked mainly by rumours that there may be a concerted round of interest rates cuts at the weekend in Europe. The futures contract ended at around 96.10. FRENCH government bonds staged a strong rally on expectations of a cut of at least 100 basis points in the repo rate today. The Matif futures contract jumped from a low of 117.60 to reach a high of 118.00, before ending at around 117.98. The yield on the 10-year bond ended at 7.16 per cent, against its previous close of 7.21 per cent. Dealers said there were also rumours of switching out of French equities into bonds. They noted particularly strong buying of French bonds by US investors. UK GOVERNMENT bonds took their cue from the other European bond markets yesterday, gaining up to  1/4 point at the long end. Dealers noted strong demand for longer-dated issues, particularly in the 20-year area. The rally enabled the Bank of England to sell two of the four tap stocks which were announced on Friday. The Pounds 250m tranche of 7 1/4 per cent stock due 1998 and the Pounds 200m tranche of 9 3/4 per cent stock due 2002 were exhausted yesterday. Short-dated gilts gained about  1/8 point, with the 7 1/4 per cent gilt due 1998 rising  3/32 to 102 1/4 . FIRMNESS in the German government bond market and hopes of lower European interest rates helped to lift Italian government bonds yesterday. The market has been rocked in recent days by political scandals and traders pointed out that Italian bonds had been 'oversold' as a result. The Liffe BTP future broke through the 94.00 level, to end at 94.32. In the cash market, the March 2003 BTP ended at 92.13, up from Tuesday's close of 91.85. ELSEWHERE in Europe, the Spanish government bond market continued to fall on political worries and lost about  3/4 point initially. However, bond prices were pulled up later by the rally in German bonds to end unchanged on the day. AFTER early gains, US Treasury prices were flat-to-firmer yesterday as investors and dealers traded cautiously ahead of today and tomorrow's all-important inflation data. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  1/8 at 102 1/8 , yielding 6.952 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year note was unchanged at 99 29/32 , to yield 3.908 per cent. The main feature of the morning was a report published by economists at Goldman Sachs, the Wall Street securities house, which predicted that the Treasury department would cut the 30-year bond from its May refunding altogether, and from then on switch to twice-yearly bond sales. The cut in bond sales would be made up by an increase in bill issuance. The changes in the borrowing schedule would be implemented as an attempt to cut the cost of financing the huge federal budget deficit. Goldman's report gave a lift to bond prices. But because it was not based on contacts with Treasury officials, the market quickly gave up most gains - prompted partly by reports of a big hedge fund sale. It was not long before attention returned to the upcoming inflation numbers. Recently, fears that inflationary pressures are building up in the economy have taken the wind out of the bond market's sales, so dealers and investors will be closely watching today's producer prices index and tomorrow's consumer price index (both for March) for any evidence of creeping inflation. THE No 145 Japanese government bond fell back sharply yesterday on speculation that it may soon lose its benchmark status. Dealers said there were rumours that the ministry of finance had suggested changing the benchmark bond more frequently. There was speculation in the market that the No 153 could take over as the benchmark issue. The No 145,which matures in March 2002, underperformed the market as the yield moved from 4.325 per cent at the opening and traded in a range of 4.32 to 4.445 per cent, before closing in Tokyo at 4.42 per cent. The bond recovered some of its losses in London trading, reaching a yield of 4.375 per cent. One trader said the rumours were unlikely to be true as the No 153, which matures in December 2002, is less liquid than the current benchmark and consists of two separate tranches. The sharp fall in the No 145 JGB added to the weak sentiment in the market, traders said. The futures contract opened at 107.76 and moved in a range of 107.60-107.91 before ending at 107.80.</p>

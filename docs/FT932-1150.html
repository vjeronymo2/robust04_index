			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Shoprite boosted 62% to Pounds 1.7m SHOPRITE, the fast-expanding discount food retailer which operates mainly in Scotland, lifted interim pre-tax profit by 62 per cent to Pounds 1.69m. The company is based in the Isle of Man, where it has property interests, supermarkets, and a car dealership, but discount food retailing has become its principal activity. Fourteen new stores were opened during the period, increasing the number in Scotland to 47. Group turnover for the half-year to May 2 increased 75 per cent to Pounds 66m. Earnings per share jumped 50 per cent to 1.91p (1.27p) as did the interim dividend, to 0.6p. Mr Deryck Nicholson, chairman, said that despite significantly increased turnover, profits for the half were only slightly above those in the second six months of last year partly due to the decision to lower prices and margins. Prices in the company's stores have fallen by an average of 8 per cent in the last year. Income from the Isle of Man property business also fell from Pounds 1.7m to Pounds 600,000, following the sale of one of the company's office blocks. The interest charge increased to Pounds 949,000 (Pounds 742,000) but gearing fell from 66 per cent to 27 per cent after a share placing and open offer raised Pounds 9.8m in February. Analysts are forecasting Pounds 4.8m for the full year.</p>

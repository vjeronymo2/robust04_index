			<p>Language: <F P=105> Indonesian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Jakarta, Kompas -- Australia, through its  International Development Aid Bureau (AIDAB), has provided a  6.1-million Australian dollar (8.3 billion rupiah) grant for  planning and managing district rivers (DAS) in Noelmina, East  Nusatenggara. A memorandum of understanding [three preceding  words in English] was signed in Jakarta on 22 November by  Forestry Minister Jamaludin Surjahadikusumo and Australian  Ambassador to Indoensia Allan R. Taylor.    The Australian ambassador clarified that the effort was  undertaken as part of the Australian community's responsibility  in connection with environmental problems. The Australian  Government believes that its cooperation with Indonesia will  bring about mutual benefit.    Mr. Taylor admitted that this is the first time that  Australia has participated in any of the forestry projects.  Besides, East Nusatenggara is not a new region because prior to  this Australia had participated in several other projects such  as the Joint District Development project which concluded in  March 1992.    The Noelmina DAS project was selected because the region is  one of the 39 DAS projects which the Forestry Department  considers the most prone to land erosion.    In his statement, Forestry Minister Jamaludin clarified that  the government has five objectives to achieve in carrying out  the DAS projects. The first is to maintain a balanced hydrology  condition in an effort to minimize forest degradation, prevent  land erosion, destruction of land, and floods. The second  objective is to increase land productivity, while the third is  to create more public awareness about the importance of forests,  land, and water pollution. The government's fourth objective is  to increase the central and provincial government's capability  of managing natural resources. The fifth objective is to  increase the local community's living standards.</p>

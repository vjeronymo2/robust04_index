			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / Stock option schemes queried BRITAIN'S largest shareholder group yesterday proposed guidelines on the awarding of stock options for top executives which could severely limit their use by large companies. The National Association of Pension Funds, whose members manage over Pounds 250bn in pension fund assets, issued a consultation document in which it proposed that shareholders ask companies to abandon the normal practice of allowing top management to exercise stock options if a certain level of earnings per share growth was achieved. Instead, the NAPF proposed that options should only be exercisable if the share price outperformed an agreed benchmark such as the FTA All-Share Index. Because only half of companies in the index can outperform it, the guidelines, if adopted, could severely curtail the issuance of executive stock options. The NAPF also said that, while it believes share option schemes have their role in motivating top executives, profit-related pay and well structured cash bonus schemes achieve that goal better. 'There is no evidence that share schemes encourage people to stay with their shares longer than is appropriate,' said Mr Angus Matheson, chairman of the NAPF's investment committee. The anecdotal evidence suggests that most executives exercise their options and sell the shares as soon as the price rises to the point at which a reasonable profit can be made. Thus, they do not encourage managers to take a long-term view on a company's performance. In explaining the NAPF's position, Mr Matheson said the review of stock options began following general concern among the membership about whether earnings per share are a reliable indicator of corporate performance. 'Everyone has become increasingly concerned about the validity of earnings per share,' he said. Fears that accounting conventions allow managements to distort EPS have led shareholders to question it is a satisfactory basis for awarding performance-related pay. The NAPF proposed guidelines would assign a specific role to non-executive directors who would have to confirm that, as well as the share price having met a pre-determined benchmark, a sustained improvement in financial performance had been achieved. The NAPF position is not shared by Britain's other major shareholders' group, the Association of British Insurers. While the ABI says it believes real financial growth must be demonstrated, it sees no better measure than EPS. Mr Matheson said 'protracted' discussions had been held with the ABI in order to prevent the two shareholder groups from recommending different policies to boards.</p>

			<p><P> March 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE EXORCISM OF A PRE-RUMPOLE DEMON;  </P> <P> LIKE MEN BETRAYED BY JOHN MORTIMER (VIKING: $16.95; 208 PP.)  </P> <P> John Mortimer is best known as creator of that lovable British TV series  "Rumpole of the Bailey," which has become a virtual one-man industry including  plays and six books of Rumpole stories. In English interviews and TV  appearances, Mortimer's plump, cheerful persona positivley overflows with a  sort of liberal bonhomie. He is living proof that much food and good wine  needn't blunt your most obvious energies.  </P> <P> But what about the more obscure demons? They're to be found in "Like Men  Betrayed," a short novel originally published here in 1953 and now reissued  presumably to cash in on Mortimer's TV fame. It's a bad novel, overwritten,  mechanically fatalistic, its prose at once stilted and exhausted. Curious,  this. It's as if Mortimer had reversed the usual writer's passage, from  youthful exuberance to elderly resignation. But a good writer's mistakes are  often instructive for a reader who, like myself, has sometimes wished that his  author, famed for his good temper, might just occasionally kick the cat for no  particular reason.  </P> <P> There's plenty of that in "Like Men Betrayed." Christopher Kennet is an  agreeably dull, stoically inhibited solicitor in a bad marriage with a hating  wife and a crooked son, Kit. Until Kit embezzles some money from one of his  father's clients, Kennet's life is grayly predictable. "In Kennet, a type of  middle-class Englishman had, in a sense, reached its culmination. The brutality  and cunning that had brought the Kennets' original wealth had been refined and  educated away." Mortimer admires, even loves, this "man of moderate sensuality  who kept his head." I suspect that Kennet, here understood and unworked-out,  later found his way into a less advertised part of the character of the  lawyer-philosopher Rumpole.  </P> <P> When Kit disappears into the London underworld -- described unconvincingly as  if taken from old Dirk Bogarde movies -- Kennet searches for his son. The  exploration shakes him out of himself, into an affair with a younger woman, and  finally to a grisly end. Julian Symons has called this book "one of the great  forgotten novels of the '50s." A generous view, that. Charitably this is a  thriller that reads like a first draft for a Grahame Greene "entertainment." A  more skilled hand might have turned it into a sympathetic study of the darker  side of the England that we still insist on seeing as quaint and "civilized."  There's a raw hatred of people here, a bleak loathing of all things English,  which Mortimer has refined over the years into something more polished and  bright. Of course we prefer Rumpole; I know I do. But I wonder if Mortimer  might yet circle back on himself to do something with the snarling, resentful  demon he exorcised -- or not? -- such a long time ago.  </P></p>

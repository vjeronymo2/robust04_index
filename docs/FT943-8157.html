			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Canadian group gives up forest rights worth Pounds 5.6m A British Columbia forestry company has relinquished its tree-cutting rights over a vast tract of rain forest as part of industry and government efforts to counter environmental pressures for tighter logging restrictions. West Fraser Timber of Vancouver estimates that timber in the Kitlope Valley, a scenic wilderness area 550km north of Vancouver, is worth about CDollars 12m (Pounds 5.64m). The decision affects 317,000 hectares of land that contain a variety of wildlife as well as one of the biggest uncut rain forests outside the tropics. Although only about 22 per cent of the area is classified as productive forest, the large, old trees which grow there would have an unusually high commercial value. Logging the Kitlope Valley would have provoked fierce protests from environmentalists as well as from the aboriginal groups that claim jurisdiction over the area. Disputes over native land claims and logging practices have led to violent confrontations in several BC forests in recent years. Mr Hank Ketchum, West Fraser's president, said that shareholders would support absorbing the loss from Kitlope. But he said that the case should not be viewed as a precedent. West Fraser hopes that its gesture will encourage the provincial government to set commercial harvesting targets. The industry has been pressing for such targets, which would provide more certainty on precisely which forests are available to be harvested. But the BC government has also been under strong pressure from environmental groups to ban logging in areas of old-growth forest, such as Kitlope, and to enforce more environment-friendly tree-cutting practices. A number of European paper buyers have responded to customers' concerns by imposing boycotts on products from British Columbia. The Kitlope announcement was timed for maximum public relations effect. Queen Elizabeth is at present in British Columbia to open the Commonwealth Games in Victoria later this week. Environmental activists plan to demonstrate against local forestry practices during the games.</p>

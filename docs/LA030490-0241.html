			<p><P> March 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WORDS OF WARNING  </P> <P> To all network and local TV programmers: It's 1990 and it's time to wake up! We  viewers aren't going to consume the same compost you keep shoveling our way  year in and year out. In case you haven't noticed, there's this swell thing  called cable that offers a lot more than you.  </P> <P> How many times do you need to hear, "Those who forget history are condemned to  repeat it"? Remember the studio film geniuses who arrogantly thought TV could  never compete with them in the early '50s?  </P> <P> We can now watch reruns of shows like "Car 54," cultural documentary series on  KCET, better movies on A&amp;E, Bravo and American Movie Classics. We no longer  want or need your Mr. Belvedere mentality turning our brains into vegetable  soup.  </P> <P> Jon Leonoudakis, Santa Monica  </P></p>

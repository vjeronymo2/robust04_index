			<p><P> September 19, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM;  </P> <P> SPECIAL STUDENTS GET CAREER ADVICE  </P> <P> Even though school has just started, about 200 seniors from the Anaheim Union  High School District spent Tuesday thinking where they were headed once the  year ends.  </P> <P> Those students were participating in the district's annual career day, and  their choice of careers or educational plans for next year was even more  difficult than it will be for some of their peers: All of the youngsters  participating in the event Tuesday have some sort of disability.  </P> <P> Those disabilities include physical and developmental handicaps as well as  learning problems such as dyslexia and poor reading comprehension, officials  said. For all of the students, their disabilities make planning for the future  more challenging.  </P> <P> "We really feel the need to bridge the gap" between high school and the working  world, said Cheryl Escoe, career specialist for the district and organizer of  the half-day conference. Counselors supervised sessions at Brookhurst Community  Center in retail sales, recreation services, advertising and a host of other  fields. Other seminars touched on a range of topics, providing advice on  preparing for a job interview, applying to a community college and responding  to harassment at work.  </P> <P> And some of the job opportunities were novel ones.  </P> <P> "How many of you know what a bone picker is?" asked Stan Corella, a  job-placement specialist at the North Orange County Regional Occupational  Program. "A bone picker is someone who picks the bones out of tuna so you don't  get bones in your tuna fish."  </P> <P> Students said they walked away from the conference with some new information  and some uplifting advice, much of that provided by the event's first speaker,  former football star and actor Rosey Grier.  </P> <P> "He was encouraging," said Denise Evans, 16, who said she must battle her  extreme shyness as she looks for work.  </P> <P> "I learned about communication," she said. "I want to get over this shyness."  </P> <P> Niki Amendola, 17, who is a slow learner in math, said the most interesting  part of the workshop for her was the discussion about harassment in the  workplace.  </P> <P> "Now I know there are places I can turn to, if you have been sexually harassed  at work; there are numbers I can call," said Niki, who hopes to get a job  working with animals after graduating in June.  </P> <P> But even more important than some of the specifics, teachers said, was the  event's overall message. Jack Zisko, work-experience coordinator at a special  education school for the severely handicapped, reminded the students that the  future is theirs to tackle.  </P> <P> "You can't depend on your mothers or fathers or guardians to do this," he said.  "If you're going to be responsible on the job, you have to be responsible for  getting the job."LISA MASCARO  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 16, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> YELTSIN PRODS GORBACHEV ON ADDED PARTIES  </P> <P> Maverick Soviet legislator Boris N. Yeltsin warned today that Soviet President  Mikhail S. Gorbachev must institute a multi-party system and other radical  political and economic reforms or risk a fall from power.  </P> <P> Yeltsin, leader of radical reformists in the Communist nation, said the Soviet  Union "now is crumbling under growing dissatisfaction of the people."  </P> <P> "I cannot predict who will preside over the party's next convention this fall  unless Gorbachev implements sweeping reforms of the constitution and party  principles," he told a news conference at the Japan National Press Club.  </P> <P> He criticized Gorbachev for promoting perestroika, or restructuring, under  outdated principles.  </P> <P> Also, he called on the Communist Party to convene a central committee meeting  to revise the constitution, which now stipulates the party's absolute hold on  power, and to make comprehensive changes in party principles.  </P> <P> "If these steps are taken before it is too late, the current very difficult  situation can be improved," he said.  </P></p>

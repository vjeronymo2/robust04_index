			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / The Italian Upheaval: Orlando, more respect abroad than at home - The leaders of the Yes and No campaigns MR Leoluca Orlando, the heavily-built ex-mayor of Palermo and founder of La Rete (The Network), is, like Mr Segni, an unlikely figure on the Italian political scene. And at first glance he is an unlikely leader of those arguing against electoral reform. A former prominent Christian Democrat who split with his party in 1990, he commands a much better press abroad than at home. A fluent German speaker, educated partly at the University of Heidelberg, Mr Orlando, 45, is for many foreigners a model for a new breed of Italian politicians. His harsh attacks on leading politicians, whom he accuses of corruption and collusion with organised crime, have won him an audience among those who see the Mafia around every corner. The focus of his tirades has been on his former party, notably Mr Giulio Andreotti, seven times prime minister, and Mr Arnaldo Forlani, the previous leader of the Christian Democrats. This week's allegations of links between Mr Andreotti and the Mafia have given Mr Orlando's claims added vigour. A self-confessed rebel since his youth, Mr Orlando, the son of a university lecturer, has been accused of using the battle against criminal organisations as a form of self-advancement. With his escort of bodyguards, frequently-changing programme to foil potential assassins, and an image of tireless energy, however, he tends to evoke mixed feelings among fellow Italians. Mr Orlando has earned the respect of foreigners. But in spite of his image as a Mafia-fighter, many voters, especially in the north, feel uncomfortable about his lengthy political career in Sicily, the heartland of the Mafia. Elected mayor of Palermo in 1985, he scored immense personal successes in a stream of subsequent polls. At administrative elections in 1990, he gained over 71,000 preference votes; in regional elections in 1991, he gained more votes than any other politician in Sicilian history. For his supporters, Mr Orlando is a tough and courageous leader, not afraid of speaking out, even at risk to his life. The party he founded, officially called the Movement for Democracy, started advocating political reform and clean government well before the revelations of corruption started to shake Italy's political fabric last year. But critics portray him as a demagogue. They accuse him of being self-centred, making controversial statements without facts to back them up, and secretly hankering for a more presidential type of government in Italy - perhaps eventually under his leadership. Suggestions of opportunism are lent weight by Mr Segni's claim that Mr Orlando originally supported the call for electoral reform, but had second thoughts. But then, for a small, if growing, party such as La Rete, moving to any form of voting system which would erode proportional representation in favour of reinforcing the bigger parties is bound to lead to second thoughts.</p>

			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / Government rejects milk market shake-up The government yesterday put at risk plans to open up the milk market in England and Wales to competition by next April by throwing out proposals by the Milk Marketing Board to turn itself into Milk Marque, a farmers' voluntary co-operative. Farmers fear the widespread criticisms of the board's reorganisation plans voiced yesterday by the government will delay the timetable for freeing up the market. The government is being forced by Brussels to abolish the milk board, which acts as an intermediary in the market by buying up all milk from farmers and selling it on to dairies. But the board's plans to transform itself into a co-operative have fallen foul of the European Commission's competition authorities. The commission indicated earlier this week that it was not happy with plans to transfer the bulk of the board's assets directly to the proposed Milk Marque, saying this needed further investigation. The reorganisation plans represent the greatest shake-up in the milk business since the board was created 60 years ago. Mr Richard Packer, permanent secretary at the Ministry of Agriculture, yesterday told the board that it should hold talks with dairy companies that have condemned the reorganisation scheme. He also asked the board to look again at its proposals for an auction system as a way of rationing milk supplies to the highest bidder. In addition, Mr Packer queried the transfer of certain assets such as National Milk Records, the milk testing laboratories, and Genus, the breeding advisory service to the new co-operative, and called into question proposals for transferring all haulage contracts to the new body and restrictive proposals on how often producers who sign up with Milk Marque are allowed to leave the organisation. Mr Andrew Dare, set to become Milk Marque's chief executive, has promised farmers higher milk prices if they join him in April - saying that prices will rise because the UK does not produce enough milk for its own needs. His plans to sign up 80 per cent of producers would still give him great power in the market. The Dairy Trade Federation, which represents wholesale milk purchasers, has criticised the proposed Milk Marque stranglehold on the market. 'The whole principle of reform in the milk market was to create an environment of free competition and the board's scheme would have severely limited it,' said Mr Neil Davidson, group executive of Northern Foods, which plans to buy its milk directly from farmers.</p>

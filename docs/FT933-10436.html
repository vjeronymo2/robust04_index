			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: PolyGram PolyGram is hardly buying Motown for a song. Even by the industry's funky standards, PolyGram is paying a lot for the black music label. The Dollars 301m consideration is almost five times the sum Motown fetched when it was sold in 1988. After subtracting the Dollars 50m value PolyGram is ascribing to the licensing and franchising activities, the acquisition price works out at 1.9 times its record sales. That may be similar to the multiple Thorn EMI paid for Virgin's music business. But then Thorn was able to make significant savings by merging its marketing and distribution activities. No such benefits are available to PolyGram, which was already acting as Motown's distributor. Still, Motown has scarcity value as about the only big independent label left around. Its catalogue of 30,000 albums contains some compulsively foot-stomping hits. New artists such as Boyz II Men and Another Bad Creation suggest it also has growth potential. PolyGram's 19 per cent increase in interim profits testifies to its skill in exploiting such raw material. The deal again raises the vexed question of whether Philips should give its infant prodigy greater leeway by selling off more shares. But PolyGram's rights issue suggests it already has a fair degree of financial autonomy, diluting Philips' holding to 75 per cent. Even though it is strapped for cash, the Dutch giant is hardly going to be singing I Want Money when it reports its second-quarter results on Thursday. PolyGram is likely to remain the sunshine of its life.</p>

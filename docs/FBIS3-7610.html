Recalling that SPA Chairman Yang Hyong-sop issued a  statement  on January 15 fully supporting the intention expressed by Yi  Ki-taek at his New Year press conference to visit Pyongyang and  meet with the great leader President Kim Il-song for the  self-existence of the nation and the improvement of the  North-South relations driven into a stalemate and that Yi  Ki-taek reiterated his intention to visit the North on several  official occasions, the spokesman says:    "We consider that his invariable intention to visit  Pyongyang  is an expression of patriotism out of the desire to break grave  impasse at present and open a bright horizon for the nation.    "Anyone who is concerned over the destiny of the country and  the nation must not block the will to visit Pyongyang and have a  significant meeting with politicians but provide all necessary  conditions and conveniences.    "We express the belief that his Pyongyang visit, if  realised,  would make an affirmative contribution to the denuclearization  of the Korean peninsula, national reunification and other  outstanding issues between the North and the South."</p>

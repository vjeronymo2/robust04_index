			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / The Coal Crisis: Unions to fight on against closures TRADE UNIONS plan to go ahead with demonstrations against the government's coal programme in spite of concessions on some of the pits originally due to be axed. Miners' leaders said they would press ahead with a lobby of parliament and a demonstration tomorrow. The TUC has no plans to cancel a protest rally in London on Sunday. TUC general secretary Mr Norman Willis described Mr Michael Heseltine's announcement as a 'massive climbdown on tactics', but one which made little difference to policy. Mr Willis said: 'There is no genuine moratorium. All the miners have got is a stay of execution.' Mr Frank Cave, vice-president of the National Union of Mineworkers and leader of the Yorkshire pitmen, said miners would fight to keep the pits open. Mr Dave Hopper, NUM secretary in the North East dismissed the announcement as a bid to head off a parliamentary revolt by Tory backbenchers. Mr Hopper said: 'It gives us time to step up our opposition and we will continue our fight with increased vigour. We will not be satisfied until the government and British Coal backs down completely.' Mr Jimmy Airlie, the AEEU electrical and engineering union's executive council member with responsibility for the nuclear industry, said: 'The government had no energy policy before Heseltine got up to speak and it had no energy policy after he sat down. We need a proper in-depth review. Even Tory backbenchers are saying it is too little too late.' Mr Bill Morris, general secretary of the TGWU transport unionm, described Mr Heseltine's announcement as 'not the U-turn the country needs', appealing to unionists and 'all people of goodwill' to maintain pressure on the government. Mr John Edmonds, general secretary of the GMB general union - one of the unions representing white-collar workers in British Coal and power workers - said that Mr Heseltine had 'missed the point' and called on the government to draw up a 'planned energy policy.' In spite of union defiance, Mr Heseltine's announcement could undermine the TUC's attempt to assemble a broad coalition against the pit closures. However, mining communities last night pursued plans for local rallies against the government's programme. A Labour MP, Mr Kevin Baron, predicted a community campaign to oppose the planned pit closures.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Alexei Novikov: "American Aid for Americans, </F> Leftovers for Russians"; first paragraph is introductory  paragraph]    [Text] Lately, the West's financial aid to Russia has been  a favorite topic of both journalists and politicians in the  majority of developed nations, with views on this question often  extremely polarized. Some, in the heat of political romanticism,  venture to prove that it is the West's sacred duty to help  Russia, others see this as useless waste of resources, still  others are convinced that this aid gives the West the right to  lay claims to part of Russia's sovereignty and demand  "obedience" from it.    These days the viewpoint of those advocating a reduction of  American aid to Russia has unexpectedly been buttressed by the  scandal which flared up in Washington over the arrest of the  Ames couple who sold information to Russian intelligence. This  has given an occasion for many American legislators to demand a  freeze on the aid program on the grounds that while the United  States has been heaping favors on the ungrateful Russia, the  latter has brazenly continued spying against it and, moreover,  paying for the traitors' services with that very same American  money.    The ethical and logical character of such lamentations is a  matter for special discussion. Now, however, let me discuss  something different. Let us suppose that the USA has really  frozen its contributions to our reforms. Who will this hurt --  Russia? Hardly.    Highly indicative is the analysis made in early March by  The Wall Street Journal, in an attempt to sort out  how the money allotted by the US administration to Russia is  being spent, whom it is spent by and for what purposes.  According to the newspaper, when the United States promised to  allot for the former USSR 5.8 billion dollars a large part of  which was meant for Russia, "there was dancing in the streets  from joy at this decision, but not in the streets of Russia. Who  mainly celebrated this event? Whole hordes of American  consultants who were about to seize a large part of the `pie' of  American aid."    Business in the field of "useful recommendations" amounts  perhaps to one of the most lucrative in present-day Russia and,  most importantly, does not carry the slightest element of risk  -- first, money is being pumped out of the US government and,  second, the worse things are in Russia, the bigger the gain in  the long term. It is not for nothing that at the US Agency for  International Development (AID), which controls nearly the  entire package of aid granted by the USA, as many as 1,200  consultants have submitted applications for participation in  this program, which is a record high for the AID in its 33 years  of existence.    As estimated by The Wall Street Journal, from 50  to 90 percent of the money granted Russia under any specific aid  contract lines the pockets of consulting firms. All this is done  so brazenly that it cannot deceive anyone, even in the USA. It  is this that compelled Marshall Goldman, a well-known expert on  Russia, to state recently to the US Congress that the aid  granted Russia, at the hands of American consultants and  "Beltway bandits," "brings minimal aid to Russians, and perhaps  nothing useful comes from this at all."    Perhaps it is only at first glance that the passage about  "beltway bandits" will seem too harsh, but only at first glance.  It is enough to take a look at some figures to understand and  forgive the unintellectuality of this thrust. The Sawyer/Miller  Co. which organized what the Americans themselves saw as a  useless act with TV ads on privatization received seven million  dollars for its implementation. Its representative in Moscow,  Marc Mellon Brown, demanded from AID a salary of 1,150 dollars  daily for his titanic labors, though, it is true, his request  was turned down. The point is that AID permits its consultants  in Russia to be paid no more than 380 dollars per day which,  considering pension benefits and overhead expenses, amounts to  800 dollars per day. And, naturally, from money designated as  aid to Russia.    How many of our helpers' "problems" are being solved in  practice can best of all be observed at Moscow's  Radisson-Slavyanskaya Hotel. A Wall Street Journal  correspondent described this as follows: "On a recent evening a  string quartette was playing in the foyer -- a hall with a  marble floor --when a large group of American businessmen, many  of whom were aid consultants, were drinking and eating, not  limiting themselves in anything. In the immediate proximity of  them, on a frosty and dark street, about a hundred elderly men  and women were wading through mud trying to sell their  possessions -- a bottle of vodka or maybe a pair of shoes -- to  passers-by."    It will be recalled that the famous Marshall Plan, which  changed postwar Europe, deliberately minimized the role of  American consultants. According to one of its architects, James  Silberman, it was then found more effective and cheaper to bring  to America 26,000 European economic managers and public figures  who then returned to Europe with the restructuring methods they  had received in the USA. As Silberman puts it, in those years  indignation was evoked by the notion about American consultants  not limiting themselves in expenses, well paid and "swimming in  aid."</p>

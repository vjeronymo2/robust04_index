			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Protean rides recession with Pounds 4.1m Protean, the laboratory equipment and water purification company, announced doubled profits of Pounds 4.1m for the 12 months to March 31. The dividend for the year is increased by 31 per cent to 3.6p via a final of 2.7p; the share price added 8p to 168p. Mr Peter Ryan, chairman, said the results were achieved against the background of the UK recession and intense competition in most markets. The contribution from the Carbolite companies and Aquadem, acquired towards the end of the previous year, helped sales rise 48 per cent to Pounds 33.6m (Pounds 22.7m). Turnover outside of the UK and the Irish Republic accounted for 43 per cent of the total. Earnings per share rose 28 per cent to 10.6p (8.29p). Mr Ryan said that during the year DA Baldwin and Epsom Glass were acquired and further opportunities would be sought. The current year had started with healthy order books.</p>

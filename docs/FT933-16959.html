			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / Survey of German Banking and Finance (3): Shareholders on sidelines - David Waller studies Germany's corporate style A couple of anecdotes give a flavour of the deep divide between the Anglo-American style of capitalism and the Germanic approach. First, a British magazine reports that the newly-anointed chief executive of a big German bank spilt some Blutwurst sausage on his new shirt just before an important engagement. The report, far from being laughed off, becomes the subject of debate at the bank's next board meeting. How dare Anglo-Saxon journalists write about such an important personage in this way? The bank contemplates cutting back its - already minimal - contact with the international press still further. Next, the finance director of Daimler-Benz, Germany's largest company, casually tells this writer what the group's profit figures are going to be this year and next. The banker's sensitivity to the Blutwurst story, in the first example, highlights more than mere lack of sense of humour. It reflects the tendency of senior German management to be removed from criticism of any kind - not just about their eating habits but also their financial performance. In the second, the willingness to let slip highly sensitive information is indicative of a cavalier approach to the mass of shareholders. It can be taken for granted that Germany's big banks and insurance companies - which own large stakes in numerous large German companies - know the figures long before they slip out in the interviews and presentations. Other shareholders are not so well served. But there is no point in becoming morally indignant about the way corporate Germany works. The stock market simply does not have the importance for the German economy, and for German companies that it does for the economy and companies in other countries - with profound consequences for the way companies are managed. While the German economy accounts for 25 per cent of the European Community's GNP, and 24 per cent of its population, the market capitalisation is only 16 per cent of the European total. There are only 665 companies on the German market; at the end of last year they were capitalised at about Dollars 333bn, accounting for 18.6 per cent of Germany's GNP. In the US, the market accounts for 66.4 per cent of GNP, in Japan 62 per cent and in the UK nearly 99 per cent. German entrepreneurs prefer not to come to the stock-market. They are averse to becoming the slaves of short-term profits expectations - and they do not like the personal publicity which comes from having a stock-market listing. When a business reaches the point where an infusion of external equity capital would help it grow, it often decides not to grow any further. Or it sells itself to one of Germany's many family-controlled industrial holdings groups. Entrepreneurs who do seek a market listing make sure that control stays with management rather than the market. A typical move would be to list only 25 per cent of the share capital. Even much bigger companies try to make sure that control does not pass away from a few friendly (usually German institutions) to the equity market as a whole. There is an emphasis on 'shareholder stability' - that is, arranging matters so that there is no possibility of management becoming unsettled via unfriendly takeovers. Pressure on management to perform is exerted by the banks and insurance companies which dominate German supervisory boards. The yardstick by which management performance is measured is not published profits: the supervisory board will have access to internal measures of profit performance. There are other criteria, too, by which the success of a company will be judged: for example, capital expenditure; growth in turnover; contribution to the local community; improvement in friendliness to the environment. The debate over management performance takes place behind closed doors. There is little need for management to justify its actions to a broader cross-section of shareholders - except perhaps at ritualised events such as the annual press conference or meeting of shareholders. Communications policy at some of Germany's larger listed companies is changing. 'Investor relations' and 'shareholder value' are terms increasingly bandied about by by senior German managers. Partly this is lip-service - but it does reflect a growing readiness to take the interests of foreign institutional shareholders seriously. These investors own between 40 and 50 per cent of the small free-float on the German stock-market, and a high percentage of shares in some large, individual companies. As yet they are not represented on the supervisory boards of the companies that they partially own. This means that their interests are perhaps not protected at the heart of the German system of corporate governance; but then few, if any, Anglo-American investors would be willing to make the long-term commitment to a company implicit in taking a supervisory board role. Despite this lack of formal representation, there are signs of a gradual convergence between the Anglo-American way of doing things (where the shareholder comes first) and the German way (where the interests of ordinary shareholder have tended to come close to the bottom of the pile of management priorities). This is brought on by two linked factors: the German recession and the likelihood that German companies will need to tap international equity markets for capital. The recession is making managers realise the importance of making money as well as generating sales. Restructuring is generating a need for capital which cannot be met from cash-flows as in the past. The capital is not so readily available from the increasingly cautious banking community - and public sector borrowing requirements are likely to keep up the cost of borrowing over the rest of this decade. The source of capital at the margin is the international fund manager; companies will have to adapt themselves to meet his or her wishes if that capital is to be forthcoming. Talk about shareholder value is a symptom of this. More telling is Daimler-Benz's decision to seek a listing on the New York stock exchange. This will require the company to be more forthcoming with sensitive financial information than in the past and will expose it more closely to the criticisms of Anglo-American investors. In return Daimler will be able to raise equity capital more cheaply and more widely than its competitors. As yet, other German companies have yet to follow suit, but Gerhard Liener, Daimler's finance director, predicts that other big German companies will be obliged to make the step soon.</p>

			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / Property: Manchester gets a breathing space - Cadogan's Place Back to basins is a surprise theme for urban renewal in Manchester. The basins belong to the city's many canals and were used by traders and commodity dealers in the 19th and early 20th centuries to unload their goods, cotton chief among them. The bales were taken to red brick warehouses as grand as palaces. By 1988, however, when the Central Manchester Development Corporation took control of 470 acres, 40 per cent of the land was derelict while the canals were in disrepair or full of contaminated waste. The population was down to 250. Over the years, the basins had been filled in and built over. Luckily, many of the great warehouses survived. What could be done with them to re-energise the city's heart? The answer was to use the canals - there are eight miles of them in the CMDC's patch - and dig out the basins as open spaces to encourage pleasure craft while converting the warehouses to flats and mixing in new buildings on the quaysides around the basins. The aim was to clean up the area and provide sophisticated living in historic surroundings in order to lure people back and let central Manchester breathe again. It is working. There are now about 2,000 residents and there will be 1,040 more from September when a student village opens at the old Dunlop Buildings where Charles Macintosh invented his raincoat around 1823. Such developers as Housing Projects, Bellway, Macbryde, the Manchester Ship Canal Company itself, Piccadilly Village and Wimpey are thrilled at how their schemes have sold, often right off the plan. Macbryde is building on Slate Wharf, beside the Bridgewater Canal, and Bellway at Woollam Place in Liverpool Road, opposite the world's first passenger railway station. Flats in these developments start at around Pounds 50,000. The smartest conversion - and selling fast, although only a few days on the market - is a warehouse beside the Rochdale Canal at 42-44 Sackville St. The Manhattan Loft Corporation, fresh from successes in London at Summers Street in Clerkenwell and Wardour Street in Soho, is turning a superb building - rich in beams, cast iron and high ceilings - into 35 shell flats which buyers will finish themselves. Prices from Pounds 54,000. Meanwhile, if you are a developer looking for a warehouse to convert, the CMDC (061-236 1166) will be happy to suggest some. The May figures of the Corporate Estate Agents property index, based on data from 4,100 offices (with about half the country's estate agency business), show a sliding market. Agreed sales fell 3.6 per cent and completed sales 4.9 per cent compared with April - which itself was 10.4 and 11.2 per cent down on March, the best month in a long time. New listings, an important sign of confidence, also fell: 6.5 per cent fewer in May than in April, which was 11.3 per cent down on March. Despite the overall slide, London is a different story. Winkworth, with 33 offices in the capital, reports that sales agreed rose 40 per cent from January to March, fell 21 per cent in April, and recovered 9 per cent in May. Noting 20 per cent price rises in central London since October 1993, 10 per cent in Battersea, Fulham, Hammersmith and Islington, and 'significant' increases further out, Winkworth expects prices to peak in the next month and then perhaps to fall back slightly in the second half of the year when, normally, fewer people try to buy. Two modernist 1930s' houses are on the market. FRS Yorke (of Yorke Rosenberg and Mardall, now the YRM Partnership) designed Torilla in Hatfield, Hertfordshire, when he was 27. Listed grade II*, it needs work to restore it as a gem of the enlightenment between the wars. Rumball Sedgwick (0727-852 384) asks around Pounds 220,000. In St John's Wood, north London David Stokes built 5 Cochrane Street NW8 in 1937 and has been there ever since. Now, though, it is time to sell. Brian Lack (071-586 5929) asks Pounds 495,000.</p>

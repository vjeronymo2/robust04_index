			<p>920706 FT  06 JUL 92 / Leading Article: Directors' pay WHEN THE Cadbury Committee on corporate governance in Britain made its recommendations in May there was widespread disappointment among institutional shareholders at the brevity and mildness of the section which dealt with the controversial subject of directors' pay. Despite the paucity of these pay guidelines, a study by one of the UK's leading remuneration consultancies has shown that only seven of the 100 companies in the FT-Stock Exchange index conform with all of them. More than three-quarters of the companies disclose the existence of a remuneration committee, but only just over half (a suspiciously low proportion) declare the existence of performance-related incentive arrangements. Barely a third explain the criteria for these incentives, while only a twelfth show separately the performance element in the remuneration of the chairman or highest-paid director. As the consultancy argues, much of the criticism over directors' pay would probably be avoided if boards took proper steps to demonstrate how pay awards arose, and to show the relationship between incentive payments, salary increases and company performance. In any case the Cadbury approach pales sharply alongside a set of tough disclosure proposals made 10 days ago by the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Current UK regulations, and the Cadbury proposals, require anything approaching detailed disclosure to be made only for the chairman and highest-paid director, which means two people at most. The SEC would require the five highest-paid executives in a company to be listed, and their remuneration packages to be broken down into a table of nine separate components. These would include stock options - the source of most US controversy, but virtually ducked by Cadbury - where a range of potential values would be shown, based on various possible increases in the company's stock price. The SEC has also made it easier for shareholders to challenge pay packages at companies' annual general meetings. In the interest of their own credibility, the boards of Britain's top companies should not just conform quickly with Cadbury's slim provisions, but volunteer further information besides.</p>

			<p><P> December 9, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DIVISION I;  </P> <P> FONTANA LIVES UP TO ITS BILLING, WINS TITLE  </P> <P> Before the start of the high school football season, the consensus around  Southern California was that Fontana High School had the best Division I team  in the Southern Section. Now it's a fact.  </P> <P> Fontana completed a 14-0 season with a 35-7 victory over Citrus Belt League  rival San Gorgonio of San Bernardino Friday night before a crowd of 20,583 at  Anaheim Stadium to win its second Division I championship in the last three  years.  </P> <P> Fontana won the title in 1987 when it defeated Capistrano Valley, 21-0. Over  the last three seasons, the Steelers are 38-2.  </P> <P> San Gorgonio, which only lost to the Steelers, 30-22, in the regular season,  was overpowered by the Steelers and running back Samita Vaoifi, who ran for two  touchdowns and passed for another.  </P> <P> However, for the second consecutive week, Fontana did not dominate at the  start. In their 48-35 victory over Edison of Huntington Beach in last week's  semifinal, the Steelers fell behind by as many as 14 points twice in the first  half.  </P> <P> Against San Gorgonio, the Steelers were charitable on the game's first play as  Vaoifi fumbled the opening kickoff on Fontana's 30-yard line. Eight plays  later, the Spartans scored when running back Ron Rivers went in from a yard out  to give San Gorgonio a 7-0 lead.  </P> <P> Unlike their game against Edison, the Steelers responded quickly with a  nine-play, 73-yard touchdown drive of their own, which Vaoifi finished with a  38-yard run.  </P> <P> "Last week (against Edison) was a special game, but that only got us here,"  Bruich saind, "We had to play this one to win the title."  </P> <P> With the score tied, 7-7, Fontana's defense forced the Spartans to punt deep  from their own territory setting up the Steelers' second score.  </P> <P> On a five-play, 30-yard drive, the Steelers went to the left throwing arm of  Vaoifi, who threw a halfback option touchdown pass to Ron Austin to give  Fontana a 14-7 halftime lead.  </P> <P> San Gorgonio began the second half with a long drive deep into the Steelers'  territory. Behind the running of Rivers, who gained 36 yards on the drive, the  Spartans had a first down on Fontana's 30-yard line before quarterback Marcus  McMaryion threw an interception to William Ephraim.  </P> <P> After a clipping penalty on Emphraim's return, Fontana went on a nine-play,  85-yard touchdown drive with the key play being a seldom-thrown 52-yard bomb  from quarterback Nick Bennett to Austin.  </P> <P> The pass caught the Spartans by surprise, as Bennett has averaged less than 40  yards passing per game all season. This would be his only attempt of the game.  Wingback Kenneth Cannon completed the drive with a 14-yard touchdown run.  </P> <P> Fontana continued with its domination after Cannon's score, by not allowing San  Gorgonio beyond midfield the rest of the game. The Steelers pressured McMaryion  into completing only five of 11 passes for 36 yards with two interceptions.  </P> <P> The Steelers extended their lead to 28-7 to begin the fourth quarter when  Vaoifi finished off a nine-play, 44-yard drive with an eight-yard touchdown  run.  </P> <P> Fontana's last score came with 5:24 remaining in the game when fullback Robert  Sylvester scored on a three-yard run.  </P> <P> San Gorgonio, which finished 10-4, had only 129 total yards in offense, with  Rivers getting 118 of those in 24 carries.  </P></p>

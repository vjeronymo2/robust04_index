			<p><P> July 11, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> NESMITH GOES OUT ON A LIMB FOR THE MONKEES  </P> <P> On the one hand, it's been easy to sympathize over the years with Michael  Nesmith's refusal to take part in any Monkees reunions. Here he is, trying to  establish a serious film-making career and pass through middle age with a few  shreds of dignity, while his three erstwhile comrades in simianism head toward  their golden years on the state-fair circuit, making funny faces and singing  tunes about how "baby, you'll soon be 16."  </P> <P> On the other hand, those with the slightest traces of mid-'60s nostalgia may  have occasionally felt the urge to shake Nesmith by the lapels and demand:  "What's your problem, anyway, buddy? Ungrateful for all those royalties? Too  artistic now to acknowledge your past and have a little fun, for criminy's  sake? Loosen up, pal!"  </P> <P> Nesmith finally did just that on Sunday before a sold-out Universal  Amphitheatre crowd, gamely joining Davy Jones, Micky Dolenz and Peter Tork for  the last 45 minutes of the Monkees' set for a one-time-only complete reunion.  He playfully made a show out of his initial reluctance to join in all their  Monkee games, but clearly seemed to get a kick out of finally participating in  the silliest of charades -- up to and including a rap version of the Monkees'  theme, and the climactic TV-show Foreign Legion Monkee walk.  </P> <P> Between goofiness, the other three backed Nesmith up on two songs from his solo  career, "Cruisin' " and the 1970 country-rockish hit "Joanne," as well as a  couple of numbers he sang lead on during the group's heyday. In return, he was  good sport enough to take a backing role (on acoustic guitar and vocals) on  some of the better pop confections of the '60s, most memorably "Last Train to  Clarksville," "Daydream Believer" and "I'm a Believer."  </P> <P> Davy: "Where've you been?"  </P> <P> Michael: "I've been looking for my hat!"  </P> <P> That sort of exchange was barely a step above all the scripted Monkeeshtick  that preceded Nesmith's arrival on stage ("We've had a request," "But we're  going to go right on singing," et al.). Nevertheless, it was a shamefully  nostalgic kick to see Nesmith -- even with hands plunged into the pockets of  his pleated pants -- get down and monkey around. As Devo would attest,  de-evolution has its charms.  </P></p>

The patent rights in this application have been assigned to the United States of America.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The prospective exclusive license will be royalty-bearing and will comply with the terms and conditions of 35 U.S.C. 209 and 37 CFR 404.7. The prospective exclusive license may be granted unless, within 60 days from the date of this published Notice, NIH receives written evidence and argument that establishes that the grant of the license would not be consistent with the requirements of 35 U.S.C. 209 and 37 CFR 404.7.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The present invention relates to a method of screening the efficacy of chemotherapeutic agents  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> in vivo <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  using target cells grown in biocompatible, selectively permeable macrocapsules. Most conventional methods (i.e., subcutaneous tumor model, sub-renal tumor model, peritoneal model and the metastasis model) permit only one type of tumor cell or cell line to be screened per experiment per animal, with the animal subsequently sacrificed for analysis. The present method allows for placing samples of syngeneic or xenogeneic cells into laboratory animals using cells or cell lines grown in selectively permeable hollow fibers or dialysis tubing. The invention provides a rapid and reliable method to screen potential chemotherapeutic agents for therapeutic uses in cancer or other human diseases. Additionally, the method allows a single experimental animal to carry implants in multiple sites allowing simultaneous evaluation of a chemotherapeutic agent capacity to reach various physiologic compartments such as subcutaneous, intraperitoneal or intra-organ regions. The advantages of this system over the classical antitumor animal models include: 1) the requirement for a smaller amount of test agent to assess preliminary  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> in vivo <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  efficacy; 2) rapid turn-around time, 3) the ability to test potential activity against multiple tumor types simultaneously in the same experimental animal; 4) a reduction in the number of experimental animals required for assessing efficacy, 5) the possibility of assessing multiple treatment schedules in a short time frame, 6) the ability to recover the entire implant, 7) the lack of contamination of the implanted cells by host cell, and 8) the ability to screen a test agent against target cells cultivated in various physiologic compartments in the same laboratory animal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The present invention can be used in transgenic animals to determine the effect of a transgenic or protein product thereof on a target cell line. Further, re-cultivating and re-screening the cells after analysis makes its possible to assess the regrowth potential of cells surviving treatment and then determine their susceptibility to a second treatment with the same or alternate chemotherapeutic agent(s).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The contemplated fields of use for licensing would be for 1) preclinical testing in animals of products for toxicity and efficacy, and 2) diagnostic testing in animals of human tissue specimens for resistance and sensitivity to alternative therapeutic regimes. Spectrum Medical Industries intends to make, use and sell products, falling within the scope of the patent application for the research and clinical diagnostic markets. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Requests for a copy of this patent application, inquiries, comments and other materials relating to the contemplated license should be directed to: John Fahner-Vihtelic, Office of Technology Transfer, National Institutes of Health, Suite 325, 6011 Executive Blvd., Rockville, Maryland 20852.

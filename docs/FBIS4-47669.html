			<p>BFN     [Text] Despite the peace efforts under way in the Zambian  capital, the communist Luanda regime continues to sow terror  inside Angola. In the area of N'dalatando, the capital of  Cuanza Norte Province, the regime's troops are still trying to  occupy the city. However, the People's Armed Forces for the  Liberation of Angola [FAPLA] are meeting with a firm response  from the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola  [UNITA] forces. Our correspondent reports on the situation over  the last 48 hours.    [Begin unidentified correspondent recording] 1. The enemy  forces have over the last 48 hours tried to recover the body of  (van den Berg), a South African mercenary who was killed on 26  April;    2. In their first attempt on 27 April, the defeated FAPLA  forces left another seven soldiers confirmed killed on the  ground. There were also indications that several wounded men  may have been dragged away from the battleground as the Luanda  regime's forces fled in disarray [words indistinct] ammunition  belt, and a number of rucksacks with assorted equipment;    3. At 0730 on 28 April, the enemy once again tried to get  near the area. They used three T-55 tanks and intense fire from  three Luanda air force combat fighters to provide cover for the  FAPLA forces. Those aircraft dropped phosphorus and napalm  bombs. The fire caused by those bombs could be seen some 40 km  away. Our forces on the ground say they saw fresh vegetation  burning and an area of 600 square meters was completely burned.    There were no victims, thanks to our forces' technical and  tactical skills, and now the siege is tightening.    4. Taking into account the human and material losses that  Luanda's Futungo de Belas Palace is suffering in its attempt to  recover the body of (Van den Berg), the aforementioned South  African mercenary, we can only assume that he must have been a  very important person. The forces of the Popular Movement for  the Liberation of Angola government will experience even more  losses, should they continue to [word indistinct] lives. The  morale of the brave Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola  could not be higher and they are determined to see that the  watchword is observed in this province: whether it is attacked  from land or from the air, N'dalatando will not fall.  N'dalatando is with UNITA. N'dalatando is with Dr. Jonas  Malheiro Savimbi. N'dalatando is with the patriots. [end  recording]</p>

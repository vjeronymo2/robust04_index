			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / Patten can expect tough time in Beijing over plans for HK MR CHRIS PATTEN, Hong Kong's governor, arrives in Beijing today for what is expected to be a difficult round of discussions with Chinese leaders on his plans for the colony's political development. Yesterday the state-owned media gave full coverage to China's objection to his proposals for greater democracy in Hong Kong and to his plans for settling the dispute about the financing of the colony's multi-billion dollar airport. On October 7, Mr Patten put forward proposals for the conduct of the colony's 1995 elections which provide for much greater democracy than for those held a year ago. The governor will hold talks with Lu Ping, director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the cabinet. At the weekend Lu was elevated to full membership of the Communist party's central committee, as was Zhou Nan, Beijing's unofficial ambassador in Hong Kong. The tone of communist Chinese media coverage of Mr Patten, both in Beijing and Hong Kong, suggests that Lu will be uncompromising in his rejection of the governor's plans for more democracy. The latest edition of Outlook Weekly, published yesterday, contained a long article detailing confidential Anglo-British talks held in the weeks proceeding Mr Patten's October 7 speech to the local Hong Kong legislature. It said that on October 3, Lu delivered a strong response to a September 26 note from Mr Patten in which he sketched his plans for the colony's political development. Outlook said Lu told Sir Robin McLaren, Britain's ambassador, that for the sake of Hong Kong's 'stability and prosperity', democracy should be developed step by step. Its development should be consistent with the Basic Law - the Beijing-drafted mini-constitution for the colony after it reverts to Chinese sovereignty in 1997. The magazine was also critical of the way in which Britain informed China of the governor's proposals. Mr Patten should have given a detailed, not summary, account of what he was going to say, Outlook said. 'He should have listened carefully to opinions from the Chinese side and reached consensus through discussions and revision before making an announcement. Only in that way could his approach be regarded as being responsible, co-operative and 'in good faith',' it said. Prominence was also given to a Xinhua news agency dispatch from Hong Kong about China's objections concerning financing the colony's HKDollars 163.5bn (Pounds 12.7bn) airport and related projects.</p>

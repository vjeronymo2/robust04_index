			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by party affairs correspondent Yerah Tal] </F>   [Excerpts] Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi Beilin called  yesterday for the immediate establishment of a new Israeli  democratic party to be created by a merger between Meretz and  Labor. Speaking before the Labor's dovish Mashov circle, Beilin  said that the move should begin at the Histadrut labor  federation by merging Hayim Ramon's list with Labor and should  extend to all the other activities by the parties.    "We would have an 80-percent majority in the Histadrut and  56  Knesset seats, which would make us as dominant as the Labor  Movement was at its peak," Beilin said. According to him, past  differences between Meretz and Labor no longer exist. He added  that a merger now would allow Ramon to implement all the reforms  he has planned as Histadrut secretary general, with Labor  assisting him. [passage omitted]    Knesset Member Ya'el Dayan rejected Beilin's idea, saying  that a merger is possible only between Meretz and the Labor  doves. Any other combination would only cause a rift, she said.  She believes there is room for such a merger in the Histadrut,  but talk of a merger on the parliamentary level is premature.  [passage omitted]    [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in English at 1000 GMT on 23 May  carries a report by Dani Gur-Arye with the following "fast and  furious" political reactions to the offer: "Meretz leader  Shulamit Aloni said the two parties have much in common, but  also many differences. She said it is still early to determine  if such a union is plausible. Yosi Sarid said the Meretz  parties should unite first, before considering a union with  Labor." The report adds that "Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin  criticized Beilin for the remark, saying his timing, following  the Histadrut elections, could not have been worse. Rabin said  a joint Labor-Meretz party would alienate middle-of-the-road  voters. Without the support of those voters, he said, the new  Israeli democratic party would be destined for the opposition."]</p>

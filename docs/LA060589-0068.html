The report quoted a Western diplomat saying unrest was continuing  in Shanghai.  </P> <P> The TV report, which ran more than three minutes, showed crowds surrounding a  truck full of troops. The crowds were shown grabbing at soldiers and shouting  amid confusion, fire and smoke.  </P> <P> The report also showed army tanks rumbling through deserted Beijing early  Sunday after troops had cleared the streets.  </P> <P> The official news agency Tass and Radio Moscow carried factual reports about  the incident, with no commentary.  </P></p>

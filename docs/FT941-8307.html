			<p>940221 FT  21 FEB 94 / Venezuela bank head named as depositors fume The Venezuela government yesterday named Mr Gustavo Roosen, president of the country's national oil company PDVSA, to head its intervention board at Banco Latino, the second-largest Venezuelan bank, which failed last month. He will have to face the increasingly militant demands of depositors seeking access to their funds and try to carry out a government plan to re-float the bank. Mr Roosen's term as head of PDVSA, one of the world's largest oil companies, was about to expire. President Rafael Caldera, who took office on February 2, has not yet named a successor. Before he took the top job at PDVSA, Mr Roosen was education minister and a senior executive at Empresas Polar, one of the world's largest beer producers. The appointment of Mr Roosen, a respected manager, represents a positive step for the new administration, which is facing a spate of economic, financial and social problems. However, still with the unfolding banking crisis, Mr Caldera is also grappling with political opposition to his efforts to replace the superintendent of banks and the head of the deposit guarantee fund (Fogade). The failure of Banco Latino sent has shock waves through Venezuela's financial system. The government has had to use scarce financial resources to repay many small depositors at Banco Latino and support other banks that suffered from unusually large withdrawals in the wake of the Banco Latino closure on January 14. The government said last week that four other financial institutions had received large sums of official financial assistance due to liquidity problems. Although neither the government nor the banks will say so publicly, this amounts to a technical intervention in the institutions, which include three commercial banks and another financial entity.</p>

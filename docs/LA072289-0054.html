			<p><P> July 22, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOVIET MARSHAL TELLS U.S. OF FEARS OVER 'STAR WARS'  </P> <P> The highest-ranking Soviet official ever to appear before Congress warned  Friday that Moscow fears the United States still seeks military superiority  over the Soviet Union with its so-called "Star Wars" program and its refusal to  negotiate reductions in naval strength.  </P> <P> In an appearance before the House Armed Services Committee, Soviet Marshal  Sergei F. Akhromeyev said the Kremlin expects to cut its military spending by  one-third to one-half before 1995 if current conventional and nuclear arms  control negotiations are successful.  </P> <P> The slight, 66-year-old officer, now a senior adviser to Soviet President  Mikhail S. Gorbachev, also said Moscow expects the North Atlantic Treaty  Organization to pursue a policy of "non-interference in the home affairs of  socialist countries" in Eastern Europe as tensions between NATO and the Warsaw  Pact are reduced over the next decade.  </P> <P> Akhromeyev spoke to the committee at the invitation of Chairman Les Aspin  (D-Wis.). Lawmakers characterized the appearance by the retired Soviet chief of  staff as unprecedented.  </P> <P> Appearing almost scholarly despite his beribboned uniform, Akhromeyev was at  times direct, at times humorous during his long session before the committee.  </P> <P> At one point, noting that the United States spends 11 times as much as the  Soviet Union on military pay, Akhromeyev remarked that U.S. admirals and  generals get higher salaries than their Soviet counterparts. Rep. G. V. (Sonny)  Montgomery (D-Miss.) asked good-naturedly if he was suggesting a cut in pay for  the Americans.  </P> <P> "God forbid!" the Russian replied. "I don't want to fight with them (the  American officers). I just started becoming friends with them."  </P> <P> Another congressman, Rep. Floyd Spence (R-S.C.), noted that Akhromeyev was  precise in divulging existing quantities of some types of Soviet weapons, but  in the case of sea-launched cruise missiles (SLCMs), he referred only to  "certain numbers" of the weapons.  </P> <P> "You don't tell us how many SLCMs you have," the Russian responded with a  smile, "so in this case, that's how I'll base my answer. . . . (But) we're  prepared to exchange that information."  </P> <P> In his formal presentation, Akhromeyev said the Soviet Union is "convinced that  political means to achieve security will predominate in the 1990s, while the  role of military means must decrease. However, the war danger has not gone  away."  </P> <P> "Let me tell you in all candor," he continued, "that we see the reason for war  danger in the position-of-strength policy pursued by the U.S. and NATO."  </P> <P> In particular, he said, if a so-called "Star Wars" anti-missile system is  created, the United States would achieve a major military advantage by having a  defensive space-based system that the Soviets would not possess. A new arms  race in space would result from implementation of the Strategic Defense  Initiative, he predicted, and the proposed strategic arms treaty to cut  offensive weapons by 50% "would become inappropriate."  </P> <P> Similarly, "a major prerequisite for further improvement in Soviet-American  relations" is a series of talks to reduce naval forces and limit military  activities at sea, he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Position of Strength'  </P> <P> "We are greatly concerned" at U.S. reluctance to begin such talks, he said,  because it suggests that the United States, after an agreement on cutting  ground forces in Europe, could "then build up its naval forces without any  constraints, especially its carrier battle groups, thus gaining military  superiority in order to dictate its will to the U.S.S.R. from the position of  strength."  </P> <P> Since 1987, Akhromeyev said, the Soviets have adopted a military doctrine of  "defensive sufficiency, which means the minimum resources possessed by a state  or an alliance needed to repulse aggression."  </P> <P> The results have included reduced military budgets and weapons production, he  said. Soviet military spending this year will total 77.3 billion rubles (about  $125 billion at the official exchange rate), he said. Cuts of 30 billion rubles  ($48 billion) will be realized over a three-year period ending in 1990, he  said.  </P> <P> Weapons production will be down an average of 19.5% by the end of 1990, he  said, with some systems cut more than others. Production of new tanks, for  example, will be reduced more than 40%. Asked if the Soviet Union produced  4,000 tanks a year, Akhromeyev said the correct figure is 1,700.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Differing Estimates of Strength  </P> <P> Aspin questioned Akhromeyev at length on the differing estimates of Soviet  military spending. U.S. intelligence officials estimate that the Soviets spend  between 130 billion and 160 billion rubles, roughly twice as much as the  official Soviet budget claims.  </P> <P> Aspin noted, and Akhromeyev agreed, that the U.S. estimate includes many  categories excluded by the Soviets, such as the costs of KGB security police  who guard the borders, civilian workers of the Defense Ministry and military  construction groups who are often engaged in non-military work.  </P> <P> But even with such factors are taken into account, the Soviet budget should be  about 100 billion rubles, rather than 77 billion, Aspin said. The two men then  agreed that the lack of a realistic pricing system in the Soviet Union, as well  as the artificially low values now placed on raw materials there, probably  account for much of the disparity.  </P></p>

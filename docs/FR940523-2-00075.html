A special initiative exists between the Office of Minority Health (OMH) and the Bureau of Primary Health Care (BPHC) aimed specifically at the Section 340A Public Housing Primary Care (PHPC) grantees. Only those grantees or applicants approved for FY 1994 funding, who have not previously received OMH/MCHC funds, are eligible for MCHC grants. Proposals for this OMH supplemental program must be submitted as part of the application for the PHPC grant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Project Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Grantees will be required: To develop community health coalitions; to identify minority-targeted health education and prevention strategies; and to implement the strategies they have identified. These strategies will help eliminate or reduce the risk for acquiring or transmitting HIV, and other health problems that are acquired and/or transmitted or associated with similar risk behaviors. The categories must include tuberculosis (TB), substance abuse and sexually-transmitted diseases (STD), and hepatitis B. Although TB is not directly related to risk behaviors underlying HIV transmission, it is a serious health problem aggravated by HIV infection. It warrants special attention in HIV education/prevention information because of its high level of communicability.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Evaluation Criteria  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Proposals for the demonstration program will be evaluated on the following:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The relative need of the population to be served for the proposed HIV/AIDS centered education/prevention program;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The adequacy of the proposed plan to assure the development and operation of an effective coalition, which should include involvement of the target population;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The appropriateness of coordination and linkages with State and local health departments and other existing HIV-related activities such as the federally funded Ryan White Consortia;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) The appropriateness of the proposed staffing pattern;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

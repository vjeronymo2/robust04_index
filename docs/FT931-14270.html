			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / Survey of The European Single Market (7): Latent power to turn the tide - Martin Wolf weighs up the prospects for united Europe's economic recovery IT WAS not supposed to be like this. The single market is open for business, just as the European economy slows down. Far from heralding renewed economic dynamism, January 1993 coincides with rising unemployment, currency turbulence and popular dissatisfaction. The European Community witnesses not a new burst of confidence and creativity, but a return to the gloom that occasioned the single market programme. The OECD's latest Economic Outlook gives the growth of Europe's real gross domestic product at 1 per cent between 1991 and 1992 and forecasts it at 1.2 per cent between 1992 and 1993. By contrast, the Outlook published last June forecast growth of 2.4 per cent between 1992 and 1993. This halving of the forecast for the coming year is consistent with the past over-optimism of the mainstream forecasters. The economic growth of 2.5 per cent forecast by the OECD for 1993 to 1994 could prove to be yet another overestimate. The European economy would then experience four successive years of disappointing growth. Economic performance of the main European economies has been far from uniform. Worst by far has been that of the UK. After falling by 2.2 per cent between 1990 and 1991 and by 1 per cent between 1991 and 1992, GDP is forecast by the OECD to rise by 1.3 per cent between 1992 and 1993. Yet even the expected growth of 2.4 per cent between 1993 and 1994 would only bring GDP back to its 1990 level. By contrast, Italy is at least expected to sustain positive growth, though at low rates, throughout. Between 1990 and 1991 growth was 1.4 per cent. This is expected to be followed by 1.2 per cent growth from 1991 to 1992 and 0.8 per cent from 1992 to 1993. In spite of Italy's fiscal crisis, the most severe among the group of seven leading industrial countries, its economic performance has not been much worse than that of France, even though French rigueur has made it the EC's blue-eyed boy. Between 1990 and 1991 French GDP expanded by 1.2 per cent. The OECD says it will expand by 1.9 per cent between 1991 and 1992 and forecasts only 1.6 per cent growth in the following year. Europe's disappointing economic performance is partly explained by an adverse world economic environment, particularly the lingering recession, from which the US seems at last to be recovering. It is also explained by problems within particular countries, notably the UK, with its overhang of private sector debt, and Italy, where public debt exceeds total GDP. But the principal failure lies in Germany, Europe's economic and geographical heart. After four years of rapid economic growth, capped by the positive economic effects of unification in 1990 and 1991, German GDP continued to expand by 2.9 per cent in the first half of 1992, but only to contract by 0.9 per cent in the second half. The OECD has forecast 1.2 per cent growth of GDP between 1992 and 1993, but the organisation's chief economist has already lowered this forecast by half a percentage point. Surprisingly perhaps, a German recession need not be bad news for the rest of Europe. The German economy has slowed in response to the Bundesbank's determination to bring inflation down from the 4.5 per cent registered in 1991 (measured by the deflator for total GDP) and expected by the OECD for 1992, to the 2 per cent it thinks is tolerable. German short term rates of interest have been exceptionally high in both nominal and real terms. But the belief that the D-Mark would never be depreciated within the exchange rate mechanism turns these German interest rates into the floor for all ERM members. Those interest rates have then deflated the economies of the rest of Europe. French short term real interest rates are 7-8 per cent, for example. The contractionary effect of these rates has endured far longer and been far stronger than the stimulus generated by the disappearance of the German current account surplus between 1990 and 1991. Europe needs lower short term rates of interest. Though a deep recession is bound to damage Germany politically and economically, it should lead to lower German interest rates and so give members of the ERM the lower interest rates they need. By now, this group excludes the UK and Italy, both shaken out of the ERM in mid-September. Apart from the suspension of the pound and the lira, the Spanish peseta has been realigned twice and the Portuguese escudo once, while the Irish punt, the Danish krone and the French franc have all been subject to considerable pressure. The collapse of Finnish, Swedish and Norwegian attempts at fixing their exchange rates attests to the general disarray. Should the process of dissolution proceed still further, the Maastricht treaty's planned march towards economic and monetary union by 1997, or 1999, will lose all plausibility. In any case, the convergence criteria laid down in that treaty, largely at German behest, will create severe difficulties. At present only two countries - France and Luxembourg - fulfil all these criteria, though Denmark (which has opted out from Emu) and Germany (the majority of whose citizens would like to opt out) almost make the grade. The European slow-down has helped to bring about convergence of inflation: eight EC member states had consumer price inflation of between 2.2 and 4.1 per cent in 1992, with German inflation highest of this group. But slow growth makes it much more difficult to meet the Maastricht criteria for fiscal policy. The IMF and the OECD argue that most member states cannot afford and should not attempt further fiscal stimulus. This may well be so, but slow growth will make reducing fiscal deficits difficult, while the immediate consequences are bound to be deflationary. Gloom is the natural reaction to Europe's current economic situation. The single market is not having the positive effect on Europe's economic performance that was hoped. The monetary system is under attack. Meanwhile, policy-makers seem totally ineffective. The growth package agreed at the Edinburgh summit was nugatory, for example. As for the Bundesbank, it remains obstinately set on its deflationary course. Yet, there is more to the prospects for the European economy than the current slow down. The important questions are those about the long term. Here there are important worries, but there are also opportunities. Among the worries are whether Germany will manage to integrate the east German economy or will be struggling semi-permanently with high overall unemployment and high public sector deficits; whether the eastern European economies will achieve rapid economic growth; whether the world economy will recover its lost dynamism; and whether, in particular, the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations will be successfully completed. These worries are the counterparts of economic opportunity. German unification should enable the EC's most important economy to achieve faster growth than in the 1970s and 1980s; eastern European reform could revitalise the European economy as a whole; and a dynamic and truly global economy can be created for the very first time. Since the EC is the world's largest trading entity and one of its two largest economies, accounting for more than a quarter of world output, it is itself able to turn its worries into opportunities.</p>

			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / Berlusconi tries to repair damage of Fininvest row Mr Silvio Berlusconi last night sought to restore his credibility with a public address aimed at solving the controversial issue of his conflicting interest as Italian prime minister and owner of the Fininvest media empire. As part of a parliamentary debate called by the opposition, Mr Berlusconi offered to make even more watertight his separation from Fininvest, Italy's second-largest private group which controls 80 per cent of commercial television. He said he was prepared to 'accept any technical solution' that was suggested by parliament. This was a significant softening of the position he outlined only last Friday. But in a defensive speech, occasionally interrupted by opposition jeering, he appeared willing to trade parliament's agreement on this issue in return for a solid mandate to continue governing. Speaking for the opposition, Mr Massimo D'Alema, leader of the former communist Party of the Democratic Left, insisted the conflict of interest was so great that Mr Berlusconi had to approve a break-up of his Fininvest television interests. He said Mr Berlusconi was incapable of addressing the issue as a statesman because he was too involved in protecting his business activities from investigating magistrates. The toughest speech in the debate came from Mr Berlusconi's partner in government, Mr Umberto Bossi, leader of the populist Northern League, who attacked the prime minister for failing to settle the conflict of interest before taking office. Mr Bossi said the league would present proposals within the next few days. In a first stage, Mr Berlusconi would have to be separated clearly from the management of Fininvest. Second, Fininvest interests must be placed in a closed fund. This suggests the league will favour sale of his assets, if not creation of a special foundation. Mr Bossi showed he intended to use the league's role in formulating legislation as a weapon to continue humiliating Mr Berlusconi - although he pledged not to bring down the government. The debate marked the second time in five days that Mr Berlusconi has had to confront problems created by his ownership of Fininvest. Last Friday, he proposed the creation of a five-member commission to monitor any conflict of interest that might arise, plus an administrator to represent his interests as Fininvest's dormant proprietor. This followed opposition concern over the way Mr Berlusconi had become dragged into a conflict between the executive and the judiciary over investigations by Milan anti-corruption magistrates into Fininvest. Last Friday, Mr Berlusconi's younger brother, Paolo, handed himself in to Milan magistrates. He later admitted to paying L330m (Pounds 135,000) in bribes to members of the Guardia di Finanza, the financial police, over the inspections of three Fininvest companies. His lawyer said the payments had been made under duress.</p>

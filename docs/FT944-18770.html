			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / Gardening: Stirred for spring - Robin Lane Fox offers a tip on how to make the most of your bulbs The cool, wet weather has rescued gardens for a suitable autumn finale and, with renewed faith, I am planning for next spring at this crucial moment. We have to stir ourselves now if we do not want a bleak April, waiting for leaves to return to the trees. We must also stir ourselves if we do not want a drab house in February. Let me first pass on a lesson that is especially gratifying because most of the nurserymen have not yet woken up to it. (There is not a word about it, either, in any of the Royal Horticultural Society pamphlets, literature and encyclopaedias which have been fast-breeding recently.) As a result, I can tell the trade how to double its market and make us all spend twice as much for better results. It should start telling us that when we plant bulbs for use in the house, we should pile them up in layers, one above the other. I mentioned this revolution last year, having heard about it from that revolutionary organisation, the Women's Institute. I can now confirm that it works. Underneath last year's hyacinths, we planted a lower layer of the white tulip Purissima. The hyacinths flowered late in January and, when we had cut off the dead pieces and reduced the length of leaves by half, the tulips appeared magically in bud and doubled the room life of the entire planting. Bolder souls put a layer of crocus on top of the hyacinths, and some of the robust and cheap yellow-flowered narcissi Soleil d'Or underneath. One lady stockbroker, with a very deep container, went further. She wrote to say she spent a happy Sunday packing in crocus, hyacinths, narcissi and, lastly, the yellow-flowered lily tulip, West Point, which surfaced through the debris late in March and gave a fourth season in a single bowl. She considered the result to be the one investment she made last autumn which was actually worth more by late March. Like all revolutions, this one is expensive, but it doubles or quadruples your return on time and space. But when I first heard of the WI suggestion, I thought it must be a joke. Surely the shoots of the narcissus would dislodge the hyacinths and the tulips would be stuck underneath in the traffic jam? But no. The key to success is a deep flower pot. The cheapest are plastic, but they are even more hideous than the average run of glorified cache-pots from a country gift shop. Indoors, I concealed them or planted directly into the deep, fluted pots of off-white china sold by the Reject Shop at up to Pounds 9 each. While these have no holes in the bottom, this did not seem to matter last year because I prepared the soil carefully and minimised watering after planting. The old way of minimising watering was to use a special bulb fibre, full of oyster-grit and willing to retain a soaking for several months. Nowadays, I cannot find this old-fashioned bulb fibre in general stores: what they sell under that name is simply peat, recycled under a seasonal label. I have now given up and simply use earth from the garden into which I mix a very small dose of water-retention crystals. Prepare the soil in a separate container by watering it, mixing in the crystals like ground almonds into a Mediterranean cake: then, wet the mixture lightly in order to activate the jelly. Next, pack it into the bowls, making sure that you have not over-jellied the mixture; otherwise, the bulbs will rot. Follow the usual rules: put the bowls in a dark, unheated cupboard or frost-proof shed where they can develop roots; the crystals should mean there will be no need for more water. Bring them into a cold room after two months, when the central layer of hyacinths should already be showing about 2in of yellow-looking growth above the soil. Give them a week or so in which to develop away from central heating, then space out their entry into your main rooms. Layered bulbs will not flower for a second season indoors, but they seem to recover outdoors and perform no worse than hyacinths which have been growing in the usual segregation. Those of you marooned in London or a flat without a serious garden ought to enjoy this multiplication of results in the same space. Outdoors, my plans now regularly concern two families to which I thought I had waved goodbye not long after this column began. The bother of growing one's own wallflowers and forget-me-nots was simply too much for today's academic part-timer: anyway, I began to tell myself how frightful those mustard-yellow wallflowers looked on Britain-in-bloom town roundabouts. Of course, it was sour grapes, because wallflowers have an exquisite scent and come in far better colours. They are back in my life with a vengeance, especially since finding a local wholesaler who supplies the councils and does the donkey work for me. My lesson here is extremely simple: wallflowers are shallow-rooted and can be grown in groups between the dormant plants of your main borders without detracting from their later seasons. I keep returning to this discovery because it has doubled the shelf life of my flowerbeds, just as layering has doubled the life of the bulbs. I plant groups of up to 20 wallflowers in reds, crimsons and the less robust Ivory White (which is neither ivory nor white) and space them at considerable intervals in the front to middle rows of the borders. There is no need to go to the expense and trouble of a continuous carpet; in spring, a few repeated groups of colour lead the eye down the bare earth and are, visually, more effective. The inter-planting with wallflowers allows me to cut down a dying border late in October, running two jobs together. Lastly, the forget-me-nots. I have tried to live without them but I miss them too much, just as the name tells us we should. Again, if you hunt around, there is sure to be a big grower for the bedding trade nearby who will do a deal on pre-grown plants in a serious quantity. My lesson here is much less forgettable: if you have the choice, always go for the smaller Indigo, not the taller and looser Royal Blue. Indigo is so much brighter, deeper and more remarkable: it is twice the plant and, only when I had been unfaithful to it for a few seasons, did I realise how much better it was. Once again, a few groups go a very long way; and, as it is so compact, you can fit it into smaller beds near the house to flower in those weeks before everything starts running wild.</p>

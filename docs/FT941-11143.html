			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / Finance and the Family: The week ahead Reuters Holdings, the international financial information and news group, is expected to announce pre-tax profits of about Pounds 435m for the year to December 31, compared with Pounds 383m last time. Most interest will focus on its plans for Quotron, the data service business it bought last month from the US bank Citicorp, to expand into the North American equities market. British Petroleum is reporting its fourth-quarter results on Thursday. Analysts expect after-tax profits of about Pounds 290m, although BP could take a large exceptional charge for the restructuring of its European chemicals division. That could amount to Pounds 200m or so after tax. Profits on Monday from Dalgety, the food and agribusiness group, for the six months to end-December, are likely to be little better than the Pounds 56.2m pre-tax reported last year. Nevertheless a small increase in the interim dividend is expected. BOC shares missed out on the bull market of 1993 as sales of industrial gases to recession-bound foreign markets slowed. First-quarter figures due out on Thursday will also show the extent of damage done to the company's healthcare division by by competition from generic alternatives to its big selling anaesthetic gases. The City is expecting a pre-tax profit for the first quarter of Pounds 75m (Pounds 90.8m), excluding a provision of Pounds 85m for restructuring announced last month. On Friday, Lloyds Bank is expected to have raised full-year operating profits marginally at best because income from securities and foreign exchange were limited. Attention will be focused on the dividend following two large increases from Royal Bank of Scotland and TSB Group. Analysts predict dividend increases of at least 15 per cent from 18.4p in 1992, given Lloyds' strong cpaital. Pre-tax profits are expected to rise to about Pounds 1bn, against Pounds 801m in 1992, with the bad debt charge falling from Pounds 556m to about Pounds 350m. British Telecom is expected to announce profits for its third quarter of between Pounds 670m and Pounds 685m, against Pounds 705m. The fall will be due to redundancy costs of about Pounds 150m (Pounds 17m) and an exceptional charge of Pounds 56m for the premium paid to repurchase government-held bonds. Profits of about Pounds 7.5m (Pounds 5.61m), together with an unchanged interim dividend of 0.2p, are expected when Amstrad reports interim results on Thursday.</p>

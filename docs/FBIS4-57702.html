			<p>BFN     [Text] Two Haitian private sector employers organizations  have condemned the appointment of Judge Emile Jonassaint as  president of the Republic. The two organizations -- the Haitian  Manufacturer's Association, or ADIH, and the Center for Free  Enterprise and Democracy -- have demanded that the Governors  Island agreement and New York pact be implemented and respected.    ADIH's executive council officially rejects the appointment  of Judge Jonassaint and his de facto government and, until  President Aristide appoints a new prime minister, recognizes as  a legitimate government only the resigning government headed by  Robert Malval.    In a press release, ADIH's executive council urges the other  sectors of the national life to take a stand to obtain a return  to constitutionality immediately and without delay.    As for the Center for Free Enterprise and Democracy, which  has denounced the unconstitutionality of the Jonassaint  government, it also denounced -- and I quote -- the immorality  of Security Council Resolution No. 917 and the discrimination  and hypocrisy of U.S. policy toward the Haitian refugees.    This center, which reminds the Army that under the  Constitution, it has the duty to protect lives and property,  also urges President Aristide to immediately appoint a new prime  minister.    Finally, this center asks all the protagonists in the  crisis,  both civilian and military, to exhibit public-spiritedness and  patriotism so as to spare the nation the shame of a military  intervention.</p>

			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / Survey of World Car Industry (25): Safety for the driver and his planet - Stuart Marshall explores the environmental and other features of Europe's latest models THE new models that will be entering European showrooms over the next 12 months will reflect the industry's success in meeting environmental needs as well as consumer demands. From next January, every new petrol-engined car must have a catalytic converter to clean up the exhaust. Some sections of the industry perceived the EC requirement as a politically inspired expedient. But they faced up to the challenge, equipping even the smallest and cheapest of their cars with the electronic fuel injection needed for a catalyser to work properly. Multi-valve engines have for some years been widely used by all Japanese makers on high volume production, as opposed to specialised high performance, cars. This was not the case in Europe, though Saab and Rover were among the few honourable exceptions as multi-valve pioneers. Now, however, they are being adopted by European manufacturers across the whole price spectrum as a means of improving power outputs without increasing cylinder capacity. Among the latest multi-valve models are a wide range of Ford Escorts and the Mercedes Benz 200-300 cars, due to be joined early next year by the replacement for the best selling 190. V6 engines are enjoying a vogue because of the space they save compared with in-line designs, which do not fit transversely into front-wheel driven cars. An alternative solution, seen in the latest Volvo 850GLT, is to mount a 5-cylinder in-line engine east-west combined with an ultra-compact manual or automatic transmission. The most space-saving conventional piston engine of all is the narrow angle V6, first used more than 60 years ago by Lancia. Audi and Volkswagen are employing two different narrow angle V6s occupying hardly any more space than in-line 4-cylinder engines of far less cylinder capacity in a number of models, including the VW Golf and Vento, the Audi 80 and 100. This illustrates another growing trend - the fitting of comparatively large displacement and high power output engines into cars of modest size. These provide the performance, and offer all the luxury equipment, expected of products in the next size class. Big is no longer beautiful among many motorists who spend much of their time driving on their own in crowded traffic conditions. Availability from early next year of the mid-sized General Motors Vauxhall Cavalier (Opel Vectra in most European markets) with a new British-built, narrow angle 2.5 litre V6 engine is a straw in the wind. So, too, is BMW's decision to offer its new V8 engines, originally introduced in the big 7-Series and intended to power its forthcoming replacement, in the 5-Series as well. Saab, also GM controlled, is expected soon to be using the British-made 2.5 V6 but has its own ideas for improving performance and minimising emissions. The GM link has given Saab access to 32-bit microprocessor technology. It is combined with a direct ignition system having a mini-coil per cylinder and no high-tension leads or distributor. This 32-bit component (most other makers use 8-bit or 16-bit microprocessors) provides exceptionally precise monitoring and control of transient state conditions within the engine. So exactly does the Saab Trionic system, with its 2m calculations each second, control combustion that it is claimed to make the 2.3 litre, turbocharged 4-cylinder engine of 1993 Saab 9000CS and CD models one of the world's cleanest. In the foreseeable future, the Trionic system will allow a petrol engine to be run on less polluting alternative fuels such as ethanol or methanol without any adjustment. Two-stroke engines, far smaller and lighter than four-strokes of the same power output, are being developed by many car makers on both sides of the Atlantic and in Japan. Ford is monitoring the performance of a fleet of two-stroke powered Fiestas in service with a British police force. Toyota has demonstrated an ultra-light and fuel efficient two-stroke powered concept town car. Chrysler also has some promising two-stroke engines at an advanced development stage in the US. The Japanese motor industry has an unnerving habit of rapidly turning concept cars into production models. For example, both Mitsubishi 3000GT and Subaru SVX were on sale within two years of being unveiled to the public at Tokyo motor show. Even so, the Japanese do not expect two-stroke engines to be in the showrooms in 1993 but a mid-decade timescale looks more promising. But for the time being, there is agreement among major European manufacturers that the diesel engine, preferably with turbocharging, intercooling and direct injection, provides the best fuel economy. Although there is a public perception that diesels are dirty - and ill-maintained heavy lorries and buses undoubtedly are - a diesel car is at least as environmentally acceptable as one with a petrol engine and three-way catalytic converter. There is a clear relationship between atmospheric pollution and fuel consumption. The diesel engine, especially when operating at less than full power and at constantly changing revolutions - as it does in traffic - has a much lower specific fuel consumption than a petrol engine. Hence its carbon dioxide emissions are proportionately lower and its efficient combustion process also creates less carbon monoxide. Now that inherent noise problems have been overcome by two-stage injectors and other means, the direct-injection car diesel is pointing to fuel economy beyond the capability of petrol engines. Without any special preparation, a new Audi 100 TDI saloon with 6-speed gearbox recently gained an entry in the Guinness Book of Records by being driven further on a single tankful than any other car. In showroom trim, it went from John o' Groats to Lands End and then back again north of the Scottish border on 17.62 gallons (80.17 litres) of fuel, giving a consumption of 75.94 mpg (3.72 l/100 km). The industry is now concentrating on further reducing the diesel car engine's particulate emissions (visible exhaust smoke), the only area in which it is significantly worse than a petrol engine. The main line of attack is to refine the fuel injection and combustion process and clean the exhaust gases by a simple oxidation catalyser. Automatic transmissions are gaining ground as urban driving in particular becomes more stressful. There can be no argument that a car with two pedals makes fewer demands on the driver in heavy traffic than one with three. Safety can only benefit. Just as 4-speed automatics have virtually taken over from the old 3-speed types, those with 5-speeds are making steady headway in cars of medium price and above. This kind of technological advance always spreads downward. When ABS brakes were first introduced, they were costly extra equipment on the most expensive cars. Now buyers expect them to be standard on modestly priced cars, particularly those of higher than average performance potential. In the same way, traction control systems have become increasingly popular on executive-class cars. They make use of the ABS brake system's electronic sensors to eliminate the risk of wheelspin and consequent loss of control when accelerating by matching engine output to tyre grip. Full-time four wheel drive performs a similar function but traction control has been found to provide most of the benefits without the weight and cost penalties. On the safety front, enhanced protection for the occupants in side impacts is now a feature of many high volume production cars. Similarly, airbags which inflate in severe frontal impacts and reduce risk of facial injury to drivers and front seat passengers are spreading down market. They cost extra  -usually over Pounds 500 - but as demand grows, prices must fall.</p>

			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Such a cordial welcome - Appetisers It is the height of the elderflower season and I am clutching a friend's recipe for elderflower cordial, to which my family is addicted. The commercial versions are not bad but the home-made ones are ambrosia. We have a car bootful of elderflowers, sugar in the cupboard and all I lack is tartaric acid or citric acid. I start off at Waitrose, Safeway and Sainsbury and am in some despair when all fail to yield the essential ingredient. On to Boots. 'Would cream of tartar do?' asks the girl behind the counter. It will not. A helpful pharmacist tells me that she can obtain some tartaric acid by Monday (it is now Saturday and I do not fancy the elderflower heads' chances of surviving that long). I head up the high street stopping in every chemist along the way. Eventually, a small pharmacist sells me citric acid and I am limp with gratitude. He tells me that many chemists do not stock it because drug addicts use it in conjunction with heroin. If this is true it seems rather hard on the brewers of elderflower syrup. As I write, the elderflowers are brewing splendidly. I am buying up all the tartaric acid that I can and the nice pharmacist at Boots has ordered in readiness for next year. But why should it be so difficult to find something so innocent? PS. The recipe - with grateful thanks to Morny Hay Davison: Ingredients: 25 big elderflower heads; 2lbs white sugar; 80 grammes tartaric acid or citric acid; 1 1/2 pints boiling water. Method: Pour the boiling water over all the ingredients and stir each day for four days. Strain through muslin and fill bottles. Forget authentic earthenware dishes from the Auvergne, microwaves and make-your-own pasta machines, today's hottest accessory for the serious cook is a blow-torch. Some weeks ago my son-in-law served a perfect creme brulee. The topping was evenly crunchy and a heavenly shade of caramel - so unlike my own efforts with a standard grill. Top chef Alastair Little specifically recommends a blowtorch as a culinary tool in his book Keep It Simple. The blowtorch can be used for crisping potato toppings, singeing chickens, caramelising bananas, browning and producing perfectly even brulees. It costs Pounds 10 and runs on propane gas. The Taymar hand-held version is perfect - do not use anything more powerful - and is available in DIY stores.</p>

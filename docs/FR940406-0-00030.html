The procedures in paragraphs (d) (1) through (3) of this section apply to hearings of complaints:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The complainant, the Board and any employee of the Board shall produce such documentary and testimonial evidence as the administrative judge deems necessary, consistent with applicable laws, regulations and policies of the Board. If documentary or testimonial evidence is needed for the hearing, and such documentary evidence is known to be contained in the files of another federal agency, or if the testimony of an employee of another federal agency is needed, then the administrative judge may seek assistance from appropriate sources in obtaining such documentary or testimonial evidence for the hearing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Administrative judges are authorized to administer oaths. Statements of witnesses shall be made under oath or affirmation or, alternatively, by written statement under penalty of perjury.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) When the complainant, or the Board or its employees fail without good cause shown to respond fully and in timely fashion to requests for documents, records, comparative data, statistics, affidavits, or the attendance of witness(es), the administrative judge may, in appropriate circumstances:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Draw an adverse inference that the requested information, or the testimony of the requested witness, would have reflected unfavorably on the party refusing to provide the requested information;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Consider the matters to which the requested information or testimony pertains to be established in favor of the opposing party;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Exclude other evidence offered by the party failing to produce the requested information or witness;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) Issue a finding fully or partially in favor of the opposing party; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (v) Take such other actions as appropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Findings and conclusions without hearing <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . (1) If a party believes that some or all material facts are not in genuine dispute and there is no genuine issue as to credibility, the party may, at least 15 calendar days prior to the date of the hearing or at such earlier time as required by the administrative judge, file a statement with the administrative judge prior to the hearing setting forth the fact or facts and referring to the parts of the record relied on to support the statement. The statement must demonstrate that there is no genuine issue as to any such material fact. The party shall serve the statement on the opposing party.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The opposing party may file an opposition within 15 calendar days of receipt of the statement in paragraph (e)(1) of this section. The opposition may refer to the record in the case to rebut the statement that a fact is not in dispute or may file an affidavit stating that the party cannot, for reasons stated, present facts to oppose the request. After considering the submissions, the administrative judge may order that discovery be permitted on the fact or facts involved, limit the hearing to the issues remaining in dispute, issue findings and conclusions without a hearing or make such other ruling as is appropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) If the administrative judge determines upon his or her own initiative that some or all facts are not in genuine dispute, he or she may, after giving notice to the parties and providing them an opportunity to respond in writing within 15 calendar days, issue an order limiting the scope of the hearing or issue findings and conclusions without holding a hearing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Record of hearing <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . The hearing shall be recorded and the Board shall arrange and pay for verbatim transcripts. All documents submitted to, and accepted by, the administrative judge at the hearing shall be made part of the record of the hearing. If the Board submits a document that is accepted, it shall furnish a copy of the document to the complainant. If the complainant submits a document that is accepted, the administrative judge shall make the document available to the Board's representative for reproduction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (g)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Findings and conclusions <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Unless the administrative judge makes a written determination that good cause exists for extending the time for issuing findings of fact and conclusions of law, within 180 days of a request for a hearing being received by the Commission, an administrative judge shall issue findings of fact and conclusions of law on the merits of the complaint, and shall order appropriate relief where discrimination is found with regard to the matter that gave rise to the complaint. The administrative judge shall send copies of the entire record, including the transcript, and the findings and conclusions to the parties by certified mail, return receipt requested. Within 60 days of receipt of the findings and conclusions, the Board may reject or modify the findings and conclusions or the relief ordered by the administrative judge and issue a final decision in accordance with &sect;268.209 of this part. If the Board does not, within 60 days of receipt of the findings and conclusions, accept, reject or modify the findings and conclusions of the administrative judge, then the findings and conclusions of the administrative judge and the relief ordered shall become the final decision of the Board and the Board shall notify the complainant of the final decision in accordance with &sect;268.209 of this part.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;268.209 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Final decisions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) The EEO Programs Director shall notify the Board of Governors when a complaint is ripe for decision under this section.

			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / Tighter rules on assets promised THE ACCOUNTING Standard Board's forthcoming paper on off-balance-sheet finance will restrict the scope for assets to be removed from the balance sheet, the FT Financial Reporting Conference was told yesterday. Mr Graham Stacy, senior technical partner of Price Waterhouse and an ASB member, said its draft will allow de-recognition of an asset only when: No significant rights to the asset are retained. Any risk retained is immaterial in relation to the variation in benefits likely to occur. Mr Andrew Lennard, assistant technical director of the ASB, said the board was considering taking a less restrictive approach to debt maturity following the hostile reaction to its treatment in the discussion document on capital instruments. He said it was likely to permit short-term debt to be reported as long-term where the same lender is firmly committed to provide further finance on the same terms. Mr Allan Cook, the ASB technical director, said the board was conducting tests with about a dozen large companies to determine the continuing value of goodwill - the difference between the net assets and the purchase price of an acquisition. That will help the ASB determine how to treat goodwill in its future proposals on accounting for business combinations. Mr John Shaw, a member of the Financial Reporting Council and chairman of the conference, said the ASB had identified a tension in enlisting support for greater disclosure and transparency in accounts from City analysts. He said this was because they in part made their livelihood from translating complex financial information.</p>

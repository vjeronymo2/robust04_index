			<p>930628 FT  28 JUN 93 / Liffe and CBOT end plans for link THE London International Financial Futures &amp; Options Exchange (Liffe) and the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) have abandoned plans to form a trading and clearing link. The exchanges decided to suspend discussions, which began last October, because Liffe was not satisfied that the terms of the linkage would bring greater volume to the exchange. The CBOT had proposed to share its growing 10-year Treasury note futures contract with the London exchange, in return for the right to trade Liffe's German and Italian government bond contracts. 'There was some concern that there might be some loss of liquidity at Liffe because of the overlap (in trading hours),' said Mr Daniel Hodson, Liffe's chief executive. The terms under discussion were that the bund future would be traded on the CBOT from 1.15pm London time. Currently, the bund future can be traded in London, either on the exchange floor or on Liffe's APT after-hours trading system, until 6pm London time. There also seems to have been a feeling that the CBOT's T-note contract, less actively traded than its jealously-guarded long-bond contract, was not a fair exchange for Liffe's top contracts. Officials at both exchanges described the end of talks as amicable and said that a potential linkage may be discussed again at some point. 'Fungible links are merely one of many ways in which exchanges can improve their distribution,' said Mr Hodson, adding that Liffe may in the future consider extending trading hours or expanding the use of its after-hours trading system. The suspension of the talks may simplify negotiations between Liffe and Globex, the 24-hour trading system owned by the CBOT, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Reuters. Globex has been in talks with the London exchange for more than four years, but Liffe's interest has dulled due to the disappointing volume generated by the system since its launch last year. Even the CBOT chairman, Mr Pat Arbor, was sceptical about the prospects of Liffe joining Globex. 'I think they are very happy with their own (after hours trading) system,' Mr Arbor said.</p>

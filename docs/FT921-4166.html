			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Marling warns of loss as sales fall is forecast MARLING INDUSTRIES, the industrial textile and vehicle body manufacturer, has warned of a loss for the year to March 31 1992. The company's shares fell 29p to 67p on Monday but held that level yesterday. Mr David Abel Smith, formerly managing director of Benjamin Priest, the Midlands engineering group, was appointed chief executive of Marling in January. He is carrying out a review of the group's businesses and expects to report in two months' time. In December Marling blamed a drop in demand at Boalloy, its commercial vehicle body manufacturer, when it reported a drop in interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 2.85m to Pounds 593,000 and cut its dividend. Marling said yesterday that turnover in the second half would be well below the Pounds 51.64m achieved in the first half, and the group would show a loss before taxation and reorganisation costs. In the year to March 31, 1991, Marling made pre-tax profits of Pounds 3.6m on sales of Pounds 121.8m. Marling is building up manufacturing facilities in its joint venture with Electrolux to produce one-piece airbags for automobile passenger protection. Mr Abel Smith said it would be some time before it would be possible to forecast when that venture would contribute to group profits.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, January 24 (KCNA) -- The Central  Committee of the Democratic Front for the Reunification of the  Fatherland on January 23 published a statement condemning the  South Korean authorities for blocking the visit of the mourners'  group of the North side to South Korea to mourn the death of the  Rev. Mun Ik-hwan, a patriotic champion of reunification, at his  bier.    By blocking the South Korean visit of our mourners' group  under an unreasonable pretext the South Korean rulers revealed  themselves as the truculent fascist dictators, human scums and  unprecedented barbarians who took off "civilian" veil, bereft of  elementary human morality and etiquette, the statement said, and  went on:    "The South Korean `regime', which is still branding the  National Alliance for the Country's Reunification (Pomminnyon)  as an `organisation benefiting the enemy', invented by the  military dictators of the `Sixth Republic' to suppress and  stifle it, is little different from the preceding military  fascist regimes, and, accordingly, it is clear to everyone that  the fascist `regime' cannot be called a `civilian government'.    "Worse still, the South Korean authorities refused to accept  our offer for mourning visit, a purely humanitarian and  compatriotic issue, by linking it with the fictitious `nuclear  problem'. This goes to prove that the `nuclear issue'  loud-mouthed by them is a product of a sinister political  purpose.    "The Kim Yong-sam group must act with discretion, well aware  that angry voices condemning this anti-human and rude act are  ringing out not only among the people of all strata, the  opposition parties but among members of the `Democratic Liberal  Party' of South Korea."</p>

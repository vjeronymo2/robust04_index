			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / Survey of World Forest Products (6): Tormented by the rising yen - Huge problems are besetting the Japanese industry Japan's paper industry is going through the shredder. Plagued by over-capacity, poor demand, plunging prices and high financial costs, the industry has most recently been tormented by the ever appreciating yen. Corporate profitability has plunged. But if the causes of the Japanese paper industry's present crisis are deceptively simple, the remedies remain elusive. The scale of the problems besetting the Japanese paper industry are huge, but the most significant remains over-capacity, a self-inflicted wound. During the bubble years of the late 1980s, paper demand increased 1.3 times GNP growth, which itself was buoyant at that time. As paper and board selling prices rose and raw material prices sank, thanks to the rising yen, so virtually every company took advantage of cheap funding to increase capacity. Paper manufacturing capacity rose from 13.5m tonnes in 1987 to 19.5m tonnes by 1991 as 43 state-of-the art paper machines came on stream. The basic problem facing the industry is that this 44 per cent rise in capacity was not matched by a commensurate increase in demand. Indeed, as the new capacity came on stream, Japan began to slip into the longest and deepest recession since the second world war, an economic downturn which continues to grip the country. Demand for paper and board, which during 1992 tumbled for the first time in 11 years, fell again last year, according to the Japan Paper Association (JPA). 'Demand for newsprint, wood-free printing papers, and art papers all fell last year,' says Kiyoshi Shirakawa, deputy general manager of the international department. 'Only light-coated papers increased.' 'The Japanese market is in deep depression. There is no growth and there is massive oversupply in almost every grade. Paper prices are falling and most companies are losing money,' explains Mr Tadahiro Kondo, general manager of the international division of the JPA. The plight of the industry, already suffering from weak demand and excess capacity, has been exacerbated by the appreciation of the yen which has sucked in imports and hit the ability of Japanese paper manufacturers to export their excess production. The US dollar, valued at Y145 in 1990, plummeted to nearly Y100 this month (May). Japanese paper exports plunged by 31.7 per cent last year to only 474,400 tonnes, while paperboard exports also slid, down 23.3 per cent to 161,700 tonnes. Barclays de Zoete Wedd estimates imports of paper and board rose just under 10 per cent last year, although volumes remain small at about 110,000 tonnes a year, according to Mr Kondo at the JPA. Given poor demand at home and abroad, falling exports and rising imports, output of paper and board fell for the second year running during 1993, down 1.9 per cent at 27.7m tonnes. Meanwhile, paper production, which had fallen 2.6 per cent in 1992, dropped another 2.4 per cent this year, according to the JPA. Operating rates have fallen brutally, from 93.7 per cent in 1989 to 82.1 per cent last year. Brokers Smith New Court expect them to fall further to 79.5 per cent. The impact of overcapacity on prices has been brutal. In the last quarter of 1993, the prices of tissue paper fell 16 per cent, while high-grade paper tumbled 12 per cent. The prices of almost every grade of paper, except newsprint remain on a downward curve. Corporate profits among the paper companies have fallen five years running. The sector's pre-tax profits are now almost entirely dependent upon sales of marketable securities, according to Smith New Court. Both Mitsubishi Paper and Settsu were forced to sell these to avoid losses during the first half of last year, for example. Faced with such a dire environment, the Japanese paper and pulp industry has reacted by implementing a series of gigantic mergers. In April last year, two of the country's largest groups, Jujo Paper and Sanyo-Kokusaku Pulp, fused to create Nippon Paper Industries, Japan's biggest paper company by turnover. The following October, Oji Paper, the country's largest paper maker, and Kanzaki Paper, the seventh biggest, also combined to create New Oji Paper, Japan's largest paper manufacturer in terms of tonnage. Smaller alliances include the link between Honshu Paper, the leading paperboard manufacturer, and Takasaki Paper, the 11th largest paper group, to share distribution and purchasing channels. The benefits of such mergers have not yet fully materialised, however. Sales and distribution costs have been cut, as have financial costs, but the willingness to reduce labour costs - representing about 12 per cent of all costs - remains limited. The paper companies, like other Japanese groups, are reluctant to make compulsory redundancies, cutting the number of employees through reduced graduate recruitment and early retirement. Nippon Paper Industries has managed to cut its headquarters staff by 400 since the merger through such means. But according to BZW, the only company to cut aggressively has been Tomoegawa Paper which is in particular difficulties. Another response has been to sell assets in an effort to reduce debt. Daishowa Paper Manufacturing, Japan's third largest paper group, has been forced to announce a five-year restructuring plan aimed at reducing debt from Y434bn in March this year to Y270bn. In addition, two creditor banks, the Industrial Bank of Japan and Fuji Bank, and a shareholder, Marubeni, have sent in managers to help management. The company expects to make a net loss of Y28.2bn during the current financial year. The prospects for the industry remain grim. The price of pulp, representing half of raw material costs which in turn represents 42 per cent of total costs, have begun to rise. Previously, the paper companies had been benefiting from a fall in pulp prices from a peak six years ago of Dollars 820 a tonne, to a low last year of Dollars 370, according to Nippon Paper Industries. Prices in December reached Dollars 500 a tonne, the company adds. The big question is whether the paper companies will be able to make price increases stick given the sickly state of demand. BZW does not expect them to succeed. The danger is the paper groups will be caught between rising pulp prices - partly offset by the appreciation of the yen - and static paper prices. Their unwillingness to cut capacity - and cede market share - means there is unlikely to be an improvement on the supply side. The one exception has been Nippon Paper Industries which scrapped a plant at Yatushiro last June. Meanwhile, most of the industry's overseas investments has been aimed at securing upstream supplies. The industry has wood supply ventures in Australia, Papua New Guinea, Vietnam, Indonesia, the US, Canada, Brazil and Chile. Last year, for example, New Oji Paper and Nissho-Iwai formed an acacia and eucalyptus plantation joint venture on New Britain Island. Mr Kyoji Hanamizu, general manager of public relations at Nippon Paper Industries, says it is highly unlikely his company will build capacity in Japan for a long time. Any new production is likely to be linked with the company's plantations, probably in Indonesia where the company is participating in a Y100bn 450,000 tonnes a year pulp mill based on acacia trees. Given the high operating costs in Japan, the future of the Japanese industry is clearly going to be overseas.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Japanese paper and paperboard production ('000 tonnes)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Grade                        1985     1987    1988    1989    1990  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Newsprint                    2,592   2,668   3,067   3,217   3,479 Printing &amp; communication*    5,991   6,637   7,628   8,830   9,251 Packaging &amp; wrapping         1,078   1,115   1,129   1,175   1,185 Sanitary tissue              1,089   1,226   1,281   1,349   1,366 Miscellaneous*               1,040   1,161   1,238   1,155   1,148 Paper total                 11,790  12,807  14,343  15,726  16,429 Paperboard total             8,679   9,730  10,281  11,083  11,657 Paper &amp; paperboard total    20,469  22,537  24,624  26,809  28,086  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Grade                         1991      1992      1993  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Newsprint                    3,516     3,253     2,917 Printing &amp; communication*    9,730     9,610     9,542 Packaging &amp; wrapping         1,177     1,110     1,076 Sanitary tissue              1,438     1,474     1,522 Miscellaneous*               1,187     1,144     1,144 Paper total                 17,048    16,592    16,202 Paperboard total            12,020    11,718    11,559 Paper &amp; paperboard total    29,068    28,310    27,761  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- * Paper classification has been altered since 1988.

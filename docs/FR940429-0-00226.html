			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter recommended that the notification time frame be changed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from 10 days to 30 days. Another commenter recommended that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> time frame either be revised to state that the institution must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notify the Secretary promptly of any changes or, barring that,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> within 90 days.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Section 498(b)(3) of the HEA requires an institution  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to submit to the Secretary with its application for participation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a copy of any contract between the institution and a third-party  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> servicer and a description of that servicer; section 487(a)(3)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requires an institution to submit information related to its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administrative capability and financial responsibility. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary interprets these statutory provisions to require  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutions to keep the Secretary apprised of any contracts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> between themselves and third-party servicers, including, any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significant modifications to those contracts, or any terminations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of those contracts. The Secretary need contract information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provided by institutions to monitor the responsibilities of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> third-party servicers. For example, if a program review uncovers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a Title IV, HEA program violation at an institution in an area  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that a third-party servicer has recently contracted to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administer, the Secretary must have current information to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identify other institutions where the same servicer may have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> committed the same violation. The Secretary believes that 10  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> days constitutes a reasonable time period in which an institution  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must inform the Secretary of any changes or terminations of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contract while at the same time providing the Secretary with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> current information on those contracts. This time frame is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consistent with the other reporting requirements concerning  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutional eligibility under 34 CFR 600.30, thereby  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilitating reporting as an institution will not have to track  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> different reporting deadlines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter objected to the requirement that a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> third-party servicer return all applicable records to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution if the contract between the servicer and institution  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is terminated, or if the servicer stops providing services, or if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the servicer files a petition for bankruptcy. The commenter  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believed that these records were the servicer's sole guarantee  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the institution would pay the servicer any fees or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compensation still owed to the servicer by the institution. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> servicer also argued that the absence of these records would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adversely affect the ability of an independent auditor in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> event the servicer had a compliance audit performed of its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administration of the institution's participation in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Title IV, HEA programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  If a third-party servicer must return records to an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution, these regulations do not prohibit a third-party  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> servicer from retaining copies of the original records in order  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to facilitate a compliance audit. The Secretary notes that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expense of copying should be unnecessary as an institution must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide a third-party servicer's independent auditor with access  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to records pursuant to 34 CFR 668.23(b).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to the comment specifying that record retention  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was a third-party servicer's sole guarantee that an institution  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> owing that servicer unpaid fees or compensation would pay, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary strongly objects to any use of Title IV, HEA program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> records as bargaining chips in a pay dispute. Access to those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> records is required for uninterrupted administration of those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs. No servicer should hold these records hostage.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Several commenters were concerned with the provisions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in this section that limited a third-party servicer's ability to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enter into a written contract with an eligible institution if the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> servicer had been limited, suspended, or terminated by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary within the past five years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Secretary understands the commenters' concerns  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> but does not believe that those concerns are justified. As the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary explained in the NPRM, if a third-party servicer is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> found to exhibit indicators of a questionable past performance,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the servicer would be prohibited from entering into a written  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contract with an institution to administer any aspect of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution's participation in the Title IV, HEA programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, notwithstanding this prohibition, the Secretary would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consider the servicer still eligible to contract with an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution if persons or entities with substantial control over  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the servicer agree to be responsible for any potential liability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> arising from the servicer's administration of the Title IV, HEA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

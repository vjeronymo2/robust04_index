			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 --> B. General Comments on the Proposed Rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Regulated institutions generally endorsed the proposed changes to the appraisal regulations, though a small number of savings associations, banks, and other commenters opposed changing the regulation. Appraisers almost unanimously opposed changing the threshold, and a large number of appraisers opposed the business loan exemption. However, appraisers commented favorably on other parts of the proposed rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A large number of appraisers commented that the proposed changes would lead to abuses that caused savings associations to fail in the mid-to-late 1980s and that the changes would violate the intent of Congress. In the experience of the agencies, and in the opinion of studies conducted on the failures of the 1980s, abuses were related to real estate acquisition or development projects and larger loans. The regulations issued today continue to require appraisals for these transactions. Moreover, the regulations fully comply with the intent of Congress by continuing to protect federal financial and public policy interests in real estate-related financial transactions as well as the safety and soundness of financial institutions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regulated institutions and appraisers have over three years experience with the appraisal regulations and have urged changes in the regulations to improve credit availability and reduce duplication, costs, and regulatory burden. Some commenters, focusing on the proposed threshold, opposed changing the regulations because they believed that additional time was needed to study the effect of the existing regulations. Delaying the issuance of the final rule would deny regulated institutions, appraisers, and borrowers the benefits of these changes. To the extent that subsequent events demonstrate that additional changes are needed, the agencies can further amend the regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One appraisal organization suggested that several of the proposed exemptions should be replaced with guidelines regarding when to obtain Title XI appraisals. Because regulated institutions and appraisers can become liable for substantial penalties for violating the regulation, the agencies believe that it benefits regulated institutions, appraisers, and the public for the agencies to identify categories of exempt transactions in the regulation. However, the agencies intend to provide supplemental information about the appraisal and evaluation practices of regulated institutions in guidance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some commenters stated that they were denied an opportunity to comment on the supplemental information identified in the November 10th notice because the materials were available only in Washington, DC, and the comment period was 30 days. The agencies believe that the public procedures on the proposed amendments to the appraisal regulations fully complied with the requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act and accorded the public a full opportunity to participate in the rulemaking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The November 10th notice explained that the supplemental materials were available from each of the agencies. In accordance with established procedures, all agencies mailed copies of those materials to any person requesting them, as well as having the documents available for review at each agency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agencies also believe the 30-day comment period was appropriate for the second comment period on the proposed amendments. The notice of supplemental information requested comment on materials that dealt almost exclusively with the appraisal threshold. As shown in Table B above, more than 11,000 comment letters were received in response to the November 10th notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=4 --> III. Section-by-Section Analysis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 --> &sect; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=7 f=2 --> XX <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> .2&blank;Definitions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> (d) Business Loan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The agencies are adopting the proposed definition of ``business loan'' as a loan or extension of credit to any corporation, general or limited partnership, business trust, joint venture, pool, syndicate, sole proprietorship (including an individual engaged in farming), or other business entity. The definition is used in connection with the exemption for business loans of $1 million or less that are not dependent on the sale of, or rental income derived from, real estate as the primary source of repayment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commenters suggested that the agencies amend the definition of business loan to include loans to individuals for business purposes and to permit use of the exemption when individuals lease real estate to a related business. Loans to individuals are included in the definition of business loan as loans to sole proprietorships and other business entities. This exemption does not apply to loans to individuals that are consumer or personal loans. Therefore, the agencies do not believe that it is necessary to amend the definition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> (h) Real Estate or Real Property  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Board is adding a definition of ``real estate'' and ``real property'' to &sect;225.62 of its regulation. The Board proposed this amendment to incorporate the definition of real estate and real property employed by the other agencies. That definition specifically excludes mineral rights, timber rights, growing crops, water rights, and similar interests.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Title XI of FIRREA does not define ``real estate'' or ``real property'' nor does the context in which these terms are used suggest that the terms are intended to have different technical meanings. See 55 FR 27762 (July 5, 1990).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> March 23, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> LEDERMAN STAYS HOT FOR EL CAMINO REAL;  </P> <P> PREP BASEBALL: CONQUISTADORE INFIELDER KNOCKS IN THREE RUNS IN A 6-2 VICTORY  OVER GRANADA HILLS.  </P> <P> Greg Lederman's theory on hitting is as rudimentary as wearing blackout under  the eyes, rubbing dirt on the bat handle, receiving the occasional splinter in  the back pocket.  </P> <P> Lederman learned a lot about the latter in his first two seasons on the El  Camino Real High varsity, during most of which he sat. So if it sounds as  though there is a parallel between his ideas on hitting and just plain getting  to take some turns at-bat, that's understandable.  </P> <P> "I just want to put the bat on the ball," Lederman said. "I just want to put it  in play."  </P> <P> In his first season as a starter, Lederman has done much more than make  contact. Through five games, the 5-foot-6 junior infielder has hit safely in 10  of 16 at-bats and leads the team with a .625 average. Lederman was at it again  Tuesday at Granada Hills, banging out two hits and driving in three runs to  lead El Camino Real to a 6-2 victory in a Northwest Valley Conference game.  </P> <P> "He's hitting the ball real well," El Camino Real Coach Mike Maio said in what  might be the biggest understatement of the young season. "He has a lot of  desire and he's very intense. He's learned how to use that to his advantage."  </P> <P> El Camino Real -- which tied Granada Hills, 3-3, on Tuesday -- had to work  through a disadvantage too. Senior right-hander Pat Treend (3-0) was  uncharacteristically wild, walking seven in five innings while striking out  seven and allowing five hits. Treend, it seems, was suffering from a sinus  problem.  </P> <P> Wobbly or not, Treend pitched four scoreless innings and several times was  timed by a radar gun at 85 m.p.h.  </P> <P> Yet Treend's stint lasted longer than planned. Junior right-hander Sean Boldt  took the mound in the bottom of the fifth, started his warmup tosses . . . and  was sent back to the bench by the plate umpire. Maio had forgotten to list  Boldt on the lineup card.  </P> <P> With his team leading, 5-0, Treend trudged back to the mound and gave up a  two-out single to Jon Condos. Gabe Padilla then drilled a run-scoring triple to  right-center. It was the first earned run allowed by Treend in 20 1/3 innings.  </P> <P> "My brain jiggled every time I let go of the ball," Treend said. "I was worn  out by the fourth or the fifth."  </P> <P> El Camino Real (4-0-1) scored three times in the first inning, and quickly at  that. Herman Merchan walked, stole second and scored on Jeff Marks' single to  right. Marks moved to second on a passed ball and scored on Ryan McGuire's  single to center. Two outs later, Lederman slammed a single into left to drive  home McGuire, who had stolen second and moved to third on a wild pitch by  Highlander starter Gabe Miller (1-2).  </P> <P> Lederman drilled a run-scoring triple into the gap in right-center to give El  Camino Real a 4-0 lead in the third. Lederman added a sacrifice fly in the  seventh for his 11th RBI in five games.  </P> <P> "It seems like I haven't hit them very hard, but they've been dropping,"  Lederman said. "And every time I come up, runners are in scoring position."  </P> <P> Of course, the key part of this phrase is every time I come up.  </P> <P> "I'm just glad to be getting to play," Lederman said. "I just want to come out  here and win some games."  </P></p>

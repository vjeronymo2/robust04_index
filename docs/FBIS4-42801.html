			<p>BFN     [Text] Government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos today said  that Greece condemns every act of violence and terrorism but it  does not accept becoming the victim of an orchestrated effort to  export Turkey's domestic problems to Greece.    Venizelos repeated that no office of the PKK [Workers Party  of Kurdistan] operates in Athens, and once again described the  Turkish claims as ridiculous, unfounded, and slanderous.  Venizelos said that President Konstandinos Karamanlis will soon  give his answer to Turkish President Suleyman Demirel's letter  and the Turkish claims regarding the PKK action.</p>

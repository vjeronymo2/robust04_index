			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / Motoring: A pedigree Jaguar - The lineage of the latest big cat YOUNG PEOPLE say Jaguars look old-fashioned. I suppose they are right. The XJ12 is the latest - and will probably go down in motoring history as the greatest - Jaguar saloon. At a glance, you can see that its shape, its character, reflect the ideas of the late Sir William Lyons. When he founded the marque in the 1930s, he demanded grace, pace and space from his designers. Jaguars were sportily low in build and had wood veneer and leather interiors. They appealed to buyers lacking funds to satisfy a secret craving for a Bentley. Nothing has really changed. The XJ12, introduced recently after a seemingly endless gestation, is the latest development of the XJ40 model which replaced the 18-year-old XJ6 in 1985. It does not look much different from the XJ6; just a bit sleeker. But, then, there could never have been any doubt that the XJ6 of 1972 had been sired by the Mk II of 1959. One could go on, but I rest my case. Nothing matters more to Jaguar than family tradition. Whims of fashion are ignored. A Jaguar with a cherished registration number is as ageless as a Range Rover (born 1970 and changed outwardly only in detail) or a Rolls-Royce. Could the motoring equivalent of the man on a Clapham omnibus tell a 1965 Silver Shadow from a 1993 Silver Spirit II? I would not put money on it. Undeniably, the XJ12 has grace. And, with a 318 horsepower, six-litre, 12-cylinder engine shoe-horned under the bonnet, more pace than one can possibly exploit in public. Jaguar claims acceleration from 0-60 mph (0-96 kph) in 6.8 seconds (two seconds less than the previous XJ12) and a top speed of 155 mph (250 kph) compared with the old model's 139 mph (224 kph). Who am I to disagree? More to the point, its mid-range acceleration has been transformed by the six-litre engine's greater pulling power. It leaps in virtual silence from 50 mph to 70 mph (80-113 kph) and 70 mph to 90 mph (113-145 kph) in 3.2 and 4.8 seconds respectively. A driver who makes the fullest use of the performance - especially the acceleration - might need to think about refilling the 19-gallon (86-litre) tank soon after covering 200 miles (325 km). Even when accelerating only moderately, I saw the computer's read-out of instant fuel consumption drop to single miles per gallon figures. My test car's 13.4 mpg (21 l/100 km) in town improved steadily to 15 mpg (18.8 l/100 km) on the motorway. Had my journey been longer, 18-19 mpg (15-16 l/100 km) might have been achievable. In the past, I have found Jaguars driven briskly on country roads to have been soft enough to make passengers feel queasy. Stiffer suspension and lower-profile (55 series) tyres have firmed up the V12's ride most agreeably, yet only a handful of less sporting luxury cars can match its lack of road noise. The steering is light and does not have much feel. Parking is easy - provided you remember the turning circle is more than 40 ft (12.4 metres). High gearing (nearly 29 mph/47 kph per 1,000 rpm) brings cloistered calm to motorway cruising. The Connolly hide and walnut-veneered interior is in classic English good taste. This ambience is no longer as exclusive as it was; wood trim has become obligatory on posh cars wherever they are made. But, in the Jaguar, it all seems natural and uncontrived. So, the Jaguar has grace and pace - but what of space? By modern standards, it does not have much. The roof line is low, so the seating position is too. Four people can travel in style in an XJ12, but they had better not try to take a large suitcase apiece. Four weekend bags practically filled the boot; two sets of golf clubs in their trolleys would not go in. The same six-litre engine and four-speed automatic transmission are now available in the XJ-S coupe at Pounds 45,100 for the hard top, Pounds 52,900 for the convertible.</p>

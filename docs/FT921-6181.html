			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / Arts: Little Village - Hammersmith Odeon It is all too tempting to pass off Little Village as the latest incarnation of the hapless phenomenon of the supergroup, as if memories of the Travelling Wilburys and our own dear Notting Hillbillies had not been sufficient warning in recent years, and the raggletaggle ghosts of Crosby, Stills and Nash weren't still going through the motions often enough (they threaten a London date in March) to haunt everyone's dreams. But a line-up of Ry Cooder, John Hiatt, Nick Lowe and Jim Keltner deserves some kind of superlative and the closest attention, not least because Little Village is the first band in which Cooder has been officially enlisted. Though Keltner is arguably one of the finest drummers in rock, and Lowe's bass-playing is tight, propulsive and irrepressibly characterful, their London debut at Hammersmith was dominated by Hiatt's raw-boned, intensely wrought singing and Cooder's magical guitar work. As their eponymous debut album (on WEA) predicted, maybe it was all a little too cool and controlled. The new songs happily rummage through country and folk rock, soul, r and b, and good old Southern funk. They produce a mixture that does ample justice to Hiatt's delivery - he is not a singer to let an ounce of meaning or expressive weight go begging - and which at its most distinctive sounds like a tight, honest reincarnation of Little Feat, with whom Cooder played as a guest in the 1970s. There were moments, though, when everyone seemed a little too well-behaved, as if the material from the new album, varied as it is, became too constricting a format for such sparky performers; Keltner, in particular, seemed restrained, and the music-making rarely took wing. In the end it was the memories of Cooder one took away - his ability to turn the most basic guitar solo into something richly strange, his powers to drive a piece of rhythm and blues as though the style had just been invented; the sheer imagination and instinctive verve of everything he does. That even surrounded by all that collective creativity, his version of his own old 'Borderline' should have been the evening's highpoint, suggests that as a band Little Village have yet to find their personality, even though as a showcase for Cooder's incomparable talents they amply justify their existence.</p>

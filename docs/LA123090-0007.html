			<p><P> December 30, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NOCTURNE: NEW YEAR'S EVE BY THOMAS CENTOLELLA  </P> <P> Now I know why I felt so sad today.  </P> <P> Why this last day of the year I felt  </P> <P> like a woman on her last legs.  </P> <P> bending toward the ground, leaning toward her last appointment.  </P> <P> Now I know why the hours were a slow procession  </P> <P> leading to this mound of snow, and why as I went to rest here  </P> <P> I looked at the sky as if I'd never seen it before.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Lying here, I have no trouble  </P> <P> imagining the woman who's been everywhere  </P> <P> and says Enough in four languages:  </P> <P> English, Italian, Baby, and Silence.  </P> <P> Her body, always so prone to pain,  </P> <P> now feels celestial, feels like nothing  </P> <P> but what six or seven stars imply.  </P> <P> So peaceful to lie down and not be afraid  </P> <P> of all the degrees below zero.  </P> <P> So good to forget trudging through the blizzard  </P> <P> that erased everything once familiar to her.  </P> <P> Now that she's over the hill  </P> <P> she's becoming part of it.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Back in the house my thoughts empty out,  </P> <P> they drift from room to room.  </P> <P> From next door comes a fuzzy piano:  </P> <P> music to be ninety by, broken hip music,  </P> <P> music of the wispy hair, and a cloud  </P> <P> that inches from eye to eye. I love this  </P> <P> largo movement somebody's put on  </P> <P> an ancient phonograph. Even with the eyes closed  </P> <P> it doesn't sound like a dirge at all.  </P> <P> </P> <P> And instead of the woeful moon rising,  </P> <P> I see a good woman sneaking under a dirty apron  </P> <P> ice cream for her punished grandchildren.  </P> <P> She sports a puckered grin toothless as an infant's  </P> <P> that a prankster of a son is making fun of, but lovingly,  </P> <P> and the horned fist quick to curse him, but lovingly.  </P> <P> I can hear the cracked dinner bell of a voice  </P> <P> calling out for the last time, and the small bird  </P> <P> that survived a paralyzing storm  </P> <P> to roost in an old woman's throat, to nest  </P> <P> in her wordlessness through every kind of bad weather.  </P> <P> </P> <P> And now I hear that high-pitched hoot of hers  </P> <P> ringing in the new year. A laugh that always was  </P> <P> a slap in the face of gloom.  </P> <P> </P> <P> From "Terra Firma" (Copper Canyon Press: $10; 96 pp.). copyright 1990 by Thomas  Centolella.

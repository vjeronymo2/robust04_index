			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 3(5) of FOGRMA, 30 U.S.C. 1702, defines the term ``lease'' to include ``any *&blank;*&blank;* profit share arrangement *&blank;*&blank;* issued or approved by the United States under a mineral leasing law that authorizes exploration for, extraction of, or removal of oil or gas.'' So, FOGRMA applies to NPSL records. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (d) General MMS Recordkeeping Rules <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The MMS issued regulations at 30 CFR 212.50, ``Required recordkeeping and reports,'' after FOGRMA's enactment. They state in part that all records *&blank;*&blank;* shall be maintained *&blank;*&blank;* for 6 years *&blank;*&blank;* unless the recordholder is notified, in writing, that records must be maintained for a longer period. When an audit or investigation is underway, records shall be maintained until the recordholder is released by written notice of the obligation to maintain records. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraphs (a) and (b) of MMS regulations at 30 CFR 212.51, ``Records and files maintenance,'' state in part that each lessee *&blank;*&blank;* shall make and retain accurate and complete records necessary to demonstrate that payments of rentals, royalties,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> net profit shares <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , and other payments related to offshore and onshore Federal and Indian oil and gas leases are in compliance with lease terms, regulations, and orders *&blank;*&blank;*. Lessees *&blank;*&blank;* required to keep records under this section shall maintain and preserve them for 6 years *&blank;*&blank;* unless the Secretary notifies the recordholder of an audit *&blank;*&blank;* and that they must be maintained for a longer period. When an audit or investigation is underway, records shall be maintained until the recordholder is released in writing from the obligation to maintain the records *&blank;*&blank;*. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Thus, part 212 specifically requires that NPSL records be maintained at least 6 years after generation. Under &sect;212.50, this period may be longer if the recordholder is notified in writing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (e) Who Is Responsible for NPSL Reporting? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The June 11, 1981, Notice to Lessees for Implementation of Net Profit Share Accounting for OCS Oil and Gas Leases, 46 FR 30897, clarifies NPSL reporting responsibilities. It states: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The designated NPSL operator must meet the reporting requirements of 30 CFR 390.031 (1980) (now 30 CFR 220.031 (1992)) for all lease interest holders. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Until production starts, each operator must file an annual report by 60 days after the lease anniversary date. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;After production starts, a monthly report must be filed and payments made. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Each operator is responsible for making NPSL payments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Further, the MMS  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Oil and Gas Payor Handbook <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , vol. II, section 3.3.8, states that NPSL operators must file a Report of Sales and Royalty Remittance (Form MMS&hyph;2014) monthly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (f) First Proposed Rule <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On June 7, 1990, MMS published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (55 FR 23248). The MMS proposed to amend the FOGRMA implementation requirement at 30 CFR 220.030 to make its recordkeeping requirements the same as FOGRMA's and those of 30 CFR 212.50 and 212.51. The MMS proposed the changes because the NPSL accounting procedures predate and conflict with FOGRMA and MMS' general recordkeeping rules. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The MMS also proposed to delete 30 CFR 220.033 because 30 CFR 217.50 already applies to all oil and gas audits, including NPSL's. The MMS is preparing separately a proposed rulemaking to revise 30 CFR part 217, Audits and Inspections; NPSL audit requirements will be included in that rulemaking. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> (g) Agreements With Operators <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> After MMS published the proposed rule, it signed agreements with over half of the existing NPSL operators. Under these agreements operators can either supply NPSL records directly to MMS or maintain them until MMS completes a lease audit. All who signed the agreement opted to maintain the records themselves rather than send them to MMS. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=3 --> II. Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The June 1990 proposed rule would have assured consistency between the NPSL rules and FOGRMA by putting the FOGRMA 6-year recordkeeping requirements in the NPSL rules. But, given the audit needs described in paragraph IV below, MMS concluded that a modified approach was needed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

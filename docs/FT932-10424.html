			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Meanwhile, for those who simply cannot wait . . . FOR INVESTORS with more modest information needs, a wide variety of services is available already - some of them free. They include: Teletext This is the service that comes free with the television signal if you have a set with teletext facilities; typically, these cost about Pounds 100 more than basic sets. The BBC service, Ceefax, provides prices of 500 shares, updated six times a day. While this is adequate for keeping a casual eye on the market, it is not really frequent enough to use for dealing decisions - especially as the updates are delayed, so the prices are never really current. (The restrictions are imposed by the stock exchange, which regards its real-time prices as one of its most valuable assets and does not want to make them available without payment). Ceefax also provides financial news headlines, real-time foreign exchange prices from NatWest, and real-time traded option prices from Liffe. It carries some personal finance information, such as credit card interest rates. Share prices can be found on Ceefax page 220 on BBC1; the index is on page 200. A slower but more comprehensive service is available on BBC2. The ITV and Channel 4 teletext service, known formerly as Oracle and now as Teletext UK, offers more than 350 (delayed) share prices, plus company news and market indicators. The index can be found on page 500 on Channel 4. Telephone services There is a wide variety of automated voice information telephone lines which offer a surprisingly sophisticated range of services, the FT's Cityline being one. Cityline provides automated real-time prices which you can dial from any sort of phone, no matter how old-fashioned. Each Monday's edition of the paper provides a Cityline code for shares in the FT's London Share Service; you dial the Cityline 'phone number with that code tacked on the end and get straight through to the share price of your choice, delivered in a slightly choppy but perfectly clear robot voice. Other newspapers offer a similar service. No subscription is required: you pay by the call. Cityline also offers some extras for people who have multi-frequency telephones (most of those bought in the past few years can become multi-frequency ones by turning a switch from 'pulse' to 'tone,' although this works for normal calls only if you are connected to a digital exchange). These additional services include access to FT unit trust prices and net asset values, which are updated once a day between 8 pm and 9 pm; and the ability to construct a portfolio of your own shares so that, when you call up using a personal access code, you can get an instant valuation of the total portfolio and step through the individual prices one by one. Cityline charges, which show up in your telephone bill, are 36p during off-peak hours and 48p a minute at other times. There is no extra charge for the portfolio service.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 22 KYODO -- The Posts and  Telecommunications Ministry will set up a study group in July on  a new framework for media industries in line with the  prospective multimedia era, ministry officials said Wednesday  [22 June].    The study group will be comprised of experts and  representatives from various media industries, ranging from  newspaper, broadcasting and cable television to  telecommunications.    They will examine, for instance, how those industries can  share access to optical fiber communication networks, and  discuss charges for their use, the officials said.    Rules for new participants in the multimedia services will  also be examined, they said, adding that existing regulations on  telecommunications and broadcasting industries should also be  reviewed.    In May, an advisory committee to the posts minister  submitted  a report urging legal preparations for the upcoming multimedia  era, which will inevitably reshape the media industry.</p>

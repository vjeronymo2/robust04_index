			<p><P> July 29, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SPEAKING OUT: L.A. HEART'S FAILURE: WHERE ARE THE PEOPLE?  </P> <P> New office towers are rising on Figueroa Street, opposite the Public Library  and on Bunker Hill. The first new downtown luxury hotel in decades recently  opened on Grand Avenue. Apartment buildings stand on Bunker Hill and in South  Park. The Metro Rail subway is under construction and the Long Beach light rail  line is operating.  </P> <P> At last, the renaissance of downtown Los Angeles is complete. Or is it? Like it  or not, the answer is no. Where are all the people?  </P> <P> At lunch time, many sidewalks are eerily uncrowded for an office district with  300,000 workers. On weekends, only Broadway is busy.  </P> <P> The Flower-Figueroa Corridor, 7th Street and Pershing Square are virtually  deserted except for panhandling derelicts and disappointed tourists who  expected to find the excitement of mid-town Manhattan or downtown San Francisco  in the middle of the nation's second largest city.  </P> <P> Why do Angelenos avoid downtown? Because the public and private sectors, which  launched the construction boom of the 1970s and 1980s, overlooked several  people-pleasing ingredients that are essential to any successful downtown.  </P> <P> What people-oriented actions will complete the renaissance of downtown Los  Angeles?  </P> <P> First, and foremost, downtown must become more "pedestrian friendly" -- in  other words, safer, cleaner and more inviting.  </P> <P> Otherwise, many office workers will not leave their high-rise cocoons at lunch.  And Southern Californians will avoid downtown Los Angeles in the evenings and  on weekends, and instead will drive to Melrose Avenue, Westwood or Venice for  shopping, entertainment and strolling.  </P> <P> To make downtown more pedestrian-friendly will require reduction in crime,  drugs and homelessness. That will take time, and cost more money than Angelenos  have been willing to spend so far.  </P> <P> But other quicker and less expensive measures can make downtown streets more  inviting:  </P> <P> Put a few more cops on the beat, widen sidewalks instead of streets, plant more  trees along the curbs, install street lighting designed for pedestrians not  just motorists, invite food vendors and flower kiosks to otherwise-empty plazas  in front of office buildings, encourage the opening of more restaurants and  theaters that attract people at night and on weekends, and transform Pershing  Square from an open-air flophouse into a usable park for all Angelenos.  </P> <P> Don't say that we lack the money for these actions. A city government and  business community that spent billions of dollars to rebuild downtown Los  Angeles over the past decade can afford to protect its investment by following  these recommendations.  </P> <P> The second people-pleasing ingredient now missing in downtown Los Angeles is an  exciting and varied shopping district. No activity attracts more people or  gives a downtown more vitality than shopping. Just look at the streets around  Union Square in downtown San Francisco.  </P> <P> At present, downtown Los Angeles boasts Broadway, the busiest downtown shopping  district west of Chicago and north of Mexico City. But Broadway's appeal is  limited, because it stocks low-priced merchandise.  </P> <P> The rest of the downtown retail district falls short of its potential, despite  the presence of the Broadway, Bullock's, May Co. and Robinson's. Only 8% of  downtown office workers go shopping during lunch time, compared to 33% in  Boston or Cleveland.  </P> <P> To strengthen downtown shopping, the city must create a retail plan for  downtown Los Angeles, besides making the streets safer, cleaner and more  inviting. Almost every American city has plans to encourage the development and  continued success of its downtown retail district. Why doesn't Los Angeles have  them?  </P> <P> Any retail plan must include the revival of 7th Street, once downtown Los  Angeles' counterpart to Manhattan's Fifth Avenue with its department stores,  which now suffer from empty storefronts and office vacancies.  </P> <P> Besides its four department stores, 7th Street has the right scale, the right  length, the right pedestrian character for a successful retail corridor. And it  has a concerned retail and business community that recently formed the Seventh  Street Associates to gain improvements from the city and other government  agencies.  </P> <P> Third, downtown Los Angeles needs more residents whose presence will attract  more shops, restaurants and entertainment, thereby, creating a vibrant  nighttime and weekend community.  </P> <P> To achieve this goal, the city must rethink its current policies about downtown  housing.  </P> <P> So far, most new downtown housing has been high-cost high-rise units, which  have met with limited success because affluent Angelenos aren't ready to trade  Brentwood for Bunker Hill.  </P> <P> Instead, the city should encourage the construction of moderately priced rental  housing on the edges of downtown. These apartments should be targeted toward  young professionals who have not accumulated the down payment for a house, have  no children and enjoy downtown's ethnic diversity and sense of urbanity.  </P> <P> Given the opportunity, plenty of young professionals are eager to be downtown  pioneers.  </P> <P> Five years ago, dozens of downtown office workers and professionals tried to  buy apartments in the 180-unit Villa Montoya, a city-subsidized low-rise  complex at 12th and Union streets just west of the Harbor Freeway.  </P> <P> Most of these purchases fell out of escrow because the would-be purchasers  earned more than the city-mandated $33,000 a year maximum income per household.  </P> <P> Fourth, the city and downtown business community must consider the importance  of "linkages," or functional connections between buildings and the streets, and  between various downtown districts.  </P> <P> Rather than turn inward like the Bonaventure Hotel or Arco Plaza's underground  shopping mall, buildings must strengthen the surrounding streetscape by adding  retail shops to their ground floor space and creating pleasant outdoor places  where people can mingle or simply relax.  </P> <P> This can be done. Look at Citicorp Plaza's Seventh Street Marketplace.  </P> <P> In a larger context, linkages must be encouraged between downtown's various  districts. Any downtown's whole is always greater than the sum of its  individual parts.  </P> <P> This can be done, too. The renovations of the Grand Central Market, Bradbury  Building and Million Dollar Theatre will connect the sterile City Hall district  with bustling Broadway. Angel's Flight, if ever put back in operation, would  link Broadway with Bunker Hill and create a splendid tourist attraction as  well.  </P> <P> As downtown Los Angeles enters another decade of building boom, isn't it time  to complete its renaissance by adding these long-overlooked people-pleasing  ingredients?  </P> <P> The winners will include the city, downtown companies and professional firms,  which must attract talented employees, and several hundred thousand Angelenos  who work or live downtown.  </P> <P> What are we waiting for?  </P></p>

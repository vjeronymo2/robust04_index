			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / UK Company News: DCC advances 49% to IPounds 22.2m DCC, the private Dublin-based industrial holding company which plans a public flotation at the end of this month, has reported a 49 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to IPounds 22.2m for the year ending March 31 1994. The advance was achieved on turnover up 36.7 per cent from IPounds 246m to IPounds 336m, including associated undertakings. The 1993 results are restated putting the accounts on a fully consolidated basis. The company has spent IPounds 33.4m on acquisitions in the past year, making a total of IPounds 76.8m spent on its acquisition programme over three years. In addition, capital investment of IPounds 37.1m has been undertaken over the same period. Net debt at the year-end is reported as IPounds 1.5m, representing 1.8 per cent of shareholders' funds of IPounds 100.8m. Mr Jim Flavin, chief executive, said 'This has been achieved without any recourse to shareholders in the past three years, and demonstrates the profit and cash generative quality of the business'. The company has not given a detailed profit and turnover breakdown by division, but its flotation prospectus is due out this Thursday. A 5-for-1 share split was carried out last March, making a total of 71m shares in issue, 95 per cent of which are held by institutional investors. Bank of Ireland sold off its 20 per cent stake in the group last December for IPounds 10 per share, before the share split. The company expects to raise less than IPounds 25m in the flotation, its main purpose being to obtain a listing in London and Dublin. A flotation price in the range of IPounds 2.50 to Pounds 3 range is anticipated, which will give a post-flotation market capitalisation in the region of IPounds 250m. Earnings per share were 19.56p (16.82p) and a second interim dividend of 3.896p makes a total for the year of 5p (2.3p).</p>

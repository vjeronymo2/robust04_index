			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / The BMW/Rover Deal: Ideas man emerges from the shadows - Pischetsrieder Profile There is more than relative youth to help distinguish the 45-year-old chairman of BMW from his peers in the top ranks of German industry. More than most, Mr Bernd Pischetsrieder has shown himself to be receptive to new ideas. He says: 'Anyone who is unable to break away from our way of thinking - a specialist mentality, moulded by education and upbringing - will not be capable of making our industry more efficient.' Mr Pischetsrieder has shown himself capable of putting new ideas into practice. In a 20-year series of production-related jobs he has been instrumental in implementing 'new' ideas such as team working, flexible manufacturing systems and working hours, and the demolition of leadership hierarchies, which are only now being introduced elsewhere in German industry. Following his appointment as chairman in May of last year, BP - as he has come to be known - has also been responsible for the project to build BMW's first US plant in North Carolina. The Spartanburg factory - which is to build a new car for the international market - was not his idea. The project was developed under Mr Eberhard von Kuenheim, his predecessor, who ran BMW for more than 20 years. It was also Mr von Kuenheim who had posted a watch on Rover with a mind to buying it. But he had also been observing Mr Pischetsrieder especially closely since 1985, when the Munich-born mechanical engineer returned from a South African posting to take charge of quality control group-wide. BP, then 37, had other options, but the quality control post meant that he would be reporting directly to and working closely with the chairman, popularly known as Mr BMW. A BMW man since joining as a production planning engineer in 1973, BP had been on the main board as head of production for less than two years when his moment came. He emerged unexpectedly, and unknown outside the motor business, at the moment when BMW's star was shining at its brightest. The marque had overtaken Mercedes-Benz as the biggest selling German quality car for the first time. BMW, by its own account, was the only domestic automotive group which last year did not slash its workforce or work short-time. Most important, it was the only one to make a profit. Against such a glittering background, and still in the shadow of Mr von Kuenheim, Mr Pischetsrieder had not achieved a high public profile until yesterday. After he had stepped into the limelight in his own right, his colleagues were at pains to stress that he is his own man, who will stand or fall by the results of the deal to buy Rover. 'He steered all the talks,' one said. 'I would like to make clear that our success is his personal achievement.'</p>

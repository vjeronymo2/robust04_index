			<p><P> May 9, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RUNNING IN A POOL  </P> <P> Question: I've been running for several years, and recently I tried running in  water, and running in water is much more difficult. Does that mean that you can  use up more calories when you run in water? Can you provide some comparison?  </P> <P> Answer: Running in a pool is estimated to consume about 1,000 calories an hour,  compared with about 600 to 700 calories when you run on land.  </P></p>

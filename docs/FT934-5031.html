			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Ensuring payments are fully accounted for - Capital Gains on cash-settled futures and options A rule change is planned for commodity and financial futures contracts and for options which are settled in cash. The chancellor's intention is to ensure that these payments are properly taken into account for the purposes of capital gains tax. The changes apply to futures contracts entered into, and options granted, on or after today. There are special capital gains tax rules (Section 143 Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992) which apply to commodity and financial futures dealt in on a recognised futures exchange, or to which a Financial Services Act 'authorised person' or 'listed institution' is a party. The rules generally ensure that payments made or received under the contract are properly taken into account for tax. But where contracts involve an initial premium and the contract is settled automatically in cash, the payer of the premium may not be able to offset the full amount against the cash receipt. This is because the payer's rights under the contract constitute a 'wasting asset' - where the CGT rules provide for the allowable expenditure to be reduced over the asset's limited life. The wasting asset rules do not apply to options, but the contracts in question are not options because they are settled automatically with no right of exercise. The chancellor proposes to change the rules to ensure that payers will get relief in full. Where an option is exercised, the capital-gains-tax rules provide that the consequences of granting or acquiring the option are merged with those resulting from its exercise. Thus, in the case of a straightforward share option, the amount of the option premium the grantor receives will be taken into account in calculating the overall gain or loss which he or she makes when transferring the shares at the agreed exercise price. Similarly, the holder will take into account, in calculating any gain or loss on disposal, not only the amount directly paid for the shares but also the option premium. The exercise of certain options may however be settled in cash, and it is not clear that such a payment qualifies as allowable expenditure.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Tigrinya </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by President Isayas Afewerki with </F> unidentified correspondents at the National Assembly on 4 March  -- recorded]    [Excerpts] [Unidentified corrspondent] The People's Front  for Democracy and Justice issued a decision on relieving  combatants from their duties. Can you brief us on the decision?    [Isayas] The first phase of relieving combatants of their  duties began last year. About 26,000 combatants have been  relieved of their duties since it started. The government  borrowed 1 billion birr from the National Bank to be able to  implement the project. The second phase is under way, conducted  by the Ministry of Defense. The project will lend money to the  combatants to enable them to establish small-scale  (?industries). Some of the combatants will be employed in  government institutions. Those who stay in the Army started  receiving their salaries as of 1 January 1994. A study is under  way currently to establish the ceiling of their salaries.  [passage omitted]    [Correspondent] The fourth session of the National Assembly  passed a resolution on the press laws of the country. What will  be the basis for the press law? Will a press law be passed in  this transitional period? What will be the role of the press  law regarding the drafting of the constitution?    [Isayas] First of all, the press law will be based on  freedom  of expression. This is not something new. Freedom of  expression existed before and after independence. So, it does  not mean there was no freedom of expression. But it is  essential to establish laws and democratic institutions. The  press law to be passed is not something new, but just official  confirmation. This press law will be in line with the country's  course and charter. [passage omitted]    The passing of the press law has a role in the country's  political affairs. Without it is impossible to have an open  political [word indistinct]. The drafting of the constitution  will have no meaning without a press law. Citizens benefiting  from the press law can express their views freely in the  drafting of the constitution in this transitional period. One  of the most important issues which has to be given priority is  the passing of the press law. Because of this, the fourth  National Congress decided to give it priority.</p>

In a statement to Moroccan private TV Channel (2M), the  Syrian ambassador said his country is for a comprehensive  settlement to the Mideast crisis and will not accept that Israel  withdraws from the Golan Heights while maintaining its  occupation of southern Lebanon.    On the latest al-Asad-Clinton summit, the Syrian ambassador  said President Clinton pledged to see to the implementation of  the UN Security Council resolutions while President Hafiz  al-Asad stressed the need to grant importance to the Arab  viewpoint far from the Zionist propaganda.    On the presence of the Syrian Army in southern Lebanon, 'Ali  Hasan said the Syrian presence cannot be compared in any way to  that of Israel. "Syria came to southern Lebanon at the request  of the Lebanese Government while Israel used force to occupy the  zone", the Syrian ambassador explained.</p>

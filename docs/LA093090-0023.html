			<p><P> September 30, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'HEAVY-DUTY ANGER' HEATS UP  </P> <P> Ladies, wake up and give us a break.  </P> <P> I was ready to shed a tear for you, but I was too busy washing the bathroom  floors and cleaning the toilet bowls.  </P> <P> I don't do windows, but I vacuum the house.  </P> <P> To clear the air, some of us men do quite more than the few chores listed in  the article.  </P> <P> So my question is, what's the big deal? If you want more done around the house,  ask nicely. You'll be surprised.  </P> <P> JOHN HARSHAW  </P> <P> Torrance  </P></p>

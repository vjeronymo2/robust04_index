			<p>CSO     [Editorial Report] The Medical Academy imeni Sechenova  claims to have developed a method for obtaining vaccines that  significantly exceed the international standard for purity. The  Moscow physicians' newspaper MEDITSINA SEGODNYA (No. 4 1994)  reports that the new purification method will enable Russia to  meet its domestic demand for vaccines and also to sell vaccines  abroad.    The method uses novel filters developed by the medical  biotechnology laboratory of the Sechenova Academy in  collaboration with the Khimvolokno Scientific Product ion  Association. The new filters consist of hollow synthetic fibers  used in spacecraft filters, which remove impurities in several  stages until the preparation is molecularly uniform. According  to the newspaper, the purity of vaccines made with the filters  is 1900 to 2500 antigen units, higher than the World Health  Organization standard of 1500 antigen units. Purification  equipment using the filters can process 40 liters of  concentrated preparation in three hours, as compared to 1 liter  per hour using conventional membrane disk filters. The  Bioavtomatika Scientific Research Center in Nizhegorod makes the  purification equipment.    MEDITSINA SEGODNYA reported that the Sechenova Academy has  already used the new technology to create an extremely pure  diphtheria anatoxin, soon to be mass produced by Biomed in  Moscow. In collaboration with the Moscow Chemical Technology  Institute imeni M. V. Lomonosov, Sechenova has also developed a  better test for evaluating immunity to diphtheria. The test kit  uses colored latex coated with purified anatoxin as an immunity  indicator. It has a two-year storage life when refrigerated,  compared to two to three months for erythrocyte-based tests.  The test can be used for rapid assessment of individual or  group immunity to determine if vaccination is necessary and safe  (Moscow MEDITSINA SEGODNYA No. 4 94).</p>

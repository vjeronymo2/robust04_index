			<p>921128 FT  28 NOV 92 / Lamont card leak investigated COMPUTER specialists yesterday ruled out opportunism over the leaking of Mr Norman Lamont's credit-card transactions. They said that the security surrounding bank card processing systems almost certainly ruled out chance. One said: 'Somebody wanted that information and somebody, not necessarily the same person, knew how to get it'. National Westminster Bank, whose Access subsidiary is the subject of an internal investigation and an inquiry by the data protection registrar, yesterday refused to give details of its system security. Mr Gary Tobin, a senior vice-president of First Data Corporation, denied his company could be responsible for the leak, which claimed Mr Lamont had overspent on his Pounds 2,000 Access card limit. The US computer company's UK subsidiary, First Data Resources, processes Access credit card data under contracts from National Westminster, Midland, and Lloyds Bank, as well as the Royal Bank of Scotland. 'Some of the information published is not held on our system, which makes it unlikely we could be the source of the leak,' he said. It is not yet known whether details of Mr Lamont's account were obtained from a computer or paper records. Card processors are conscious of their obligations under the Data Protection Act and financial data is typically processed in conditions of high security. Passwords and security badges are necessary to enter computer centres and codes are used to gain entrance to computer rooms. Several levels of password will be necessary to gain access to the computer system. These systems, and printers used to produce warning letters, will be held in extra secure areas. Investigators will have access to an audit trail which will show which terminal was used for every transaction, at what time, and which password was used. It is unlikely, nevertheless, that each screen is held in a separate room. However, an organisation such as Access could have more than 100 junior staff working on screens - allowing the possibility of electronic eavesdropping.</p>

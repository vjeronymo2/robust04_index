			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / Private investors to get discount in power sell-off The government yesterday laid the ground for what could be its last multi-billion pound disposal when it outlined plans to sell its remaining 40 per cent stakes in electricity generators National Power and PowerGen in February. The sale is expected to raise about Pounds 4bn in three tranches, between Pounds 1.2bn and Pounds 1.6bn of it in the current financial year. At least two-fifths of the shares will be offered to private investors at discount prices. Rather than set up a share information office, the government will give 'share shops' of banks, building societies, stockbrokers and other financial intermediaries an exclusive role in collecting registrations for the public offer. Ministers argue that this will make investors more familiar with share trading than if they dealt through an information office which would be disbanded on the sale's completion. Proceeds from the sale will dwarf those from any other privatisations before the next general election, including a potential sale of 51 per cent of the Post Office. Of industries remaining in the public sector, only Railtrack could raise anything approaching Pounds 4bn but there are doubts both about its value and the potential to sell it. At yesterday's share prices, National Power had a market value of Pounds 5.8bn and PowerGen one of Pounds 4bn, valuing the government's respective holdings at Pounds 2.3bn and Pounds 1.6bn. The government said it expected to begin marketing the sale in January in preparation for pricing the shares and offering them the following month. Payments will be in three instalments, each of them in a different tax year. The first is likely to be 30 to 40 per cent of the total. The prices will be determined following bids from institutional investors in two separate open-priced international tenders. The international offer will include a retail tender to enable individuals to bid for shares in either or both companies on similar terms to institutions. Small investors in the UK will only be able to buy a package of shares in both companies, with a pre-determined ratio, possibly three of National Power to two of PowerGen. Barclays de Zoete Wedd and Kleinwort Benson, advising the government, said that if retail demand was strong, the 40 per cent allocation of shares to the public could increase. Discounts to the public will be reflected in a lower first instalment. Existing shareholders will need to register with share shops to be eligible for incentives and preferences in allocation over other applicants. London stock market, Page 40</p>

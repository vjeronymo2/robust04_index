			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / Observer: Inflation While there is no such thing as a recession-proof industry, canny investors might do worse than inspect the UK brassiere market. According to the research organisation Mintel, British women spent Pounds 450m on 84m bras in 1991, up from Pounds 388m on 71m in 1989. The market is also changing shape. There is a 'a swing towards the more glamorously styled, underwired bra', and the average size has gone up to 36C from 34B in just ten years. The manufacturers are putting the increase down to 'more exercise and the use of the pill'.</p>

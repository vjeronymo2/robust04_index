			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / British Coal staff cuts confirmed BRITISH COAL has confirmed that it is to shed 3,000 white-collar jobs as it continues its struggle to reduce costs. Mr Neil Clarke, chairman, said yesterday that the cuts were essential if collieries that were still in operation after the recent round of closures were to win coal sales. Under a restructuring plan the five operational groups will be reduced to just two, and opencast mining operations will be streamlined. The plan includes changes to the organisation of marketing, finance, operations, information, and technology. Many in-house services are to be outsourced. British Coal said trade unions would be fully consulted about the restructuring. It hopes to achieve staff reductions by voluntary redundancy where possible. The 3000 jobs are out of a total 5,500 under review in white-collar departments. British Coal hopes to put the main elements of the new structure in place by September-October and have it complete by March-April 1994. Mr Martin O'Neill, Labour's energy spokesman, said: 'These job losses are the first indication of the knock-on effect of the pit closure programme and are part of a wider acceleration of the run-down of the industry in the mad dash for privatisation.' British Coal is seeking private operators for the last five of the 19 collieries it no longer wants to keep open. These are Shirebrook in Nottinghamshire, Taff Merthyr in Mid Glamorgan, Coventry, Merseyside's Parkside and Sharlston in West Yorkshire. Advertisements will be appearing in the national press.</p>

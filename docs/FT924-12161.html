			<p>921022 FT  22 OCT 92 / Overtime ban at Rolls-Royce WORKERS at two Coventry Rolls-Royce plants making aircraft engine components will today begin an overtime ban in protest at job losses. Rolls-Royce informed employees at the plants last year that it needed to shed about 500 jobs by the end of 1992. There have been insufficient voluntary redundancies and Rolls-Royce said unions have declined management's request for talks about the possibility of compulsory redundancies.</p>

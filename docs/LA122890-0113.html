			<p><P> December 28, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> AIR AROUND BURWELL CLEARED UP IN OREGON;  </P> <P> COLLEGE FOOTBALL: FRESHMAN'S TEAM-HIGH 1,539 TOTAL YARDS HELP WASH AWAY THE  FRUSTRATION OF HIGH SCHOOL TRANSFER PROBLEMS.  </P> <P> University of Oregon tailback Sean Burwell chuckled recently when he was asked  about the bleakest moment of his football career -- the City Section's 1987  decision to bar him from playing at Cleveland High.  </P> <P> "It was really stupid," Burwell said, "but I can laugh at it now."  </P> <P> Burwell treats the incident lightly because his career turned out all right. In  fact, it turned out better than all right. Burwell, a redshirt freshman, was  Oregon's leading rusher this season and he set a school record for all-purpose  yards with 1,539. On Saturday, the 5-foot-11, 181-pound tailback will lead the  Ducks against Colorado State in the Freedom Bowl at Anaheim Stadium.  </P> <P> But as a high school junior back in '87, Burwell's future wasn't so certain. He  had transferred to Cleveland from Chaminade -- a small, private parochial  school -- rather than face punishment for his role in a fight with a teammate  during a summer weight-training session. But City Section red tape and rules  turned Burwell into a gridiron exile at his own school.  </P> <P> He could attend Cleveland, a public school only a few blocks from his Canoga  Park home but was not allowed to play football for the Cavaliers. A newspaper  article at the time called him "football's version of the man in the iron face  mask."  </P> <P> Burwell had been projected as a starter for Cleveland. As a sophomore at  Chaminade, he had gained more yards (1,211) that year than any area high school  athlete, with the exception of Russell White.  </P> <P> He practiced with Cleveland in the fall of '87, but a few days before the  opener, the City declared him ineligible because, basically, his mother made  too much money.  </P> <P> The City grants eligibility to a player who changes schools but not his  residence if the player proves that it would be a financial or emotional  hardship to go anywhere else. Burwell first claimed financial hardship, but a  City rules committee voted 6 to 0 to deny him eligibility on the grounds that  his mother's financial position was above the allowable minimum, although City  officials conceded that their criteria for deciding minimums were "subjective."  </P> <P> The Burwells then felt forced to change their plea to emotional hardship, but  that only turned the situation ugly. Burwell, who is black, said racial tension  had made it impossible for him to continue going to Chaminade.  </P> <P> His former teammates called him a troublemaker and a negative person. Cleveland  coaches accused City Section officials of carrying on a vendetta against the  Cavaliers.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, "All of this is really putting the family through the wringer," his  mother, Sharon Burwell, said at the time. "Sean's been depressed. It's been  very hard on us."  </P> <P> Fortunately, reason eventually prevailed. On Oct. 9, 1987, two games into the  season, a three-member City appeals panel ruled that Burwell did indeed have  both emotional and financial hardship and made him eligible to play at  Cleveland.  </P> <P> Three hours after the judgment, Burwell played in the Cavaliers' 27-6 loss to  Taft, rushing for 55 yards and one touchdown.  </P> <P> "I was upset" about missing the season's first two games, Burwell said. "I  didn't understand them not letting me play. I should have been able to go to  public school where I wanted and have all the privileges a regular student  had."  </P> <P> After the eligibility controversy, Burwell's junior year was anticlimactic. He  gained only 256 yards in 69 carries but made All-Valley 4-A League as a  defensive back.  </P> <P> While Burwell had trouble getting on the field his junior year, Cleveland  coaches couldn't keep him off it his senior year. Burwell played all 48 minutes  of every game, rushing for 1,145 yards, including a torrid five-game stretch  during which he averaged 8.6 yards a carry and gained a career-high 225 yards  against Canoga Park.  </P> <P> But his offensive exploits went largely ignored -- thanks to the presence of  Russell White.  </P> <P> Burwell did get named West Valley League defensive most valuable player and  made The Times' All-Valley first team as a defensive back, but he was  determined to play offense in college, so he made it known to recruiters that  his defensive days were over.  </P> <P> "I like offense better," he said.  </P> <P> Despite the angst of transferring schools in 1987, Burwell believes it was all  worthwhile. "Switching schools helped me get recruited" by Division I teams, he  said. "I know I would have done good at Chaminade, but I may have been  overlooked because it was such a small school. It was a lot easier getting a  ride coming out of Cleveland."  </P> <P> Burwell went to Oregon expecting to play right away but was shocked to discover  that the freshman class was going to be redshirted. "At first it frustrated  me," he said, "but then it didn't bother me."  </P> <P> In spring practice this year, Burwell competed with Ngalu Kelemeni for the  tailback position.  </P> <P> The two alternated as starters in the Ducks' first three games until Burwell  won the job permanently and went on to become the fourth-leading rusher in the  Pacific 10 Conference with 949 yards.  </P> <P> A back injury limited his playing time in the season-ending Oregon State game  and probably prevented him from being the first Duck freshman to rush for 1,000  yards.  </P> <P> "If you give him a little space, he's an explosive player," Oregon Coach Rich  Brooks said.  </P> <P> Despite his impressive statistics in only his first year playing big-time  college football, Burwell "hasn't thought about playing in the pros," he said.  "I'm just concentrating on being a good college player."  </P> <P> And he promises not to even think about transferring.  </P></p>

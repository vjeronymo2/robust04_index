			<p><P> January 19, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SANTA CLARITA VALLEY;  </P> <P> JUDGE MAY DISMISS 2 SCHOOL FUNDING SUITS  </P> <P> A Los Angeles Superior Court judge Wednesday appeared to be leaning toward  dismissing two lawsuits filed by crowded Santa Clarita Valley school districts  to block two housing developments until funding is found to build new schools.  </P> <P> Judge Kurt J. Lewin said he would consider Los Angeles County's motion to drop  the suits. "In my opinion, what this is really all about is the imposition of  fees" on developers, he said.  </P> <P> Lewin called the lawsuits an attempt to circumvent a state law on school  financing. An appellate court last month held that the law sets limits of $1.50  per square foot on the amount school districts can charge housing developers  for school construction.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Schools Attorney  </P> <P> Wendy Wiles, attorney for the William S. Hart and Saugus school districts,  argued that the lawsuits are not asking the county to impose fees to pay for  schools and, as such, should not be tied to the appellate court ruling.  </P> <P> The school districts simply are asking that the projects, which include more  than 3,000 homes, apartments and condominiums, be postponed until funding is  obtained, she said.  </P> <P> Because the developments were approved without considering schools, Wiles said,  the districts maintain that the housing projects do not comply with a  sophisticated development-monitoring system adopted by the county in 1987. The  system, or the DMS, was the result of a 12-year lawsuit brought by slow-growth  groups against the county.  </P> <P> The DMS prohibits the county from approving residential projects that will  overburden the school system, she said.  </P> <P> Darlene Phillips, a county attorney, argued that the state school financing  law, enacted in 1987, clearly preempts imposition of fees by the county on  developers to pay for school construction under the DMS. County Counsel Dewitt  W. Clinton agreed in an opinion issued earlier this month.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Will Seek Transfer  </P> <P> Wiles said she will ask that the case be transferred to Judge Norman L.  Epstein, who presided over the last two years of the DMS lawsuit.  </P> <P> Phillips said after the hearing that to remove the case from Lewin's court  would amount to "a slap in the face of Judge Lewin." Lewin, however, said he  "would be happy to have Judge Epstein" hear the lawsuit if the school districts  wish.  </P> <P> Phillips said she doubts that the county would attempt to block the school  districts' efforts to have the case transferred to Epstein.  </P> <P> "I'm not surprised that a decision was not rendered" Wednesday, said Clyde  Smyth, superintendent of the Hart district. "It's an incredibly complicated  issue."  </P> <P> The three high schools in that district will be over capacity by a total of  almost 2,000 students by 1992, Smyth said. He added that based on county  population projections for the year 2010 in the fast-growing valley, the five  area school districts will need $400 million to allow doubling their student  enrollment to more than 40,000.  </P> <P> The valley's population is expected to increase from its current 120,000 to an  estimated 270,000 by 2010 because of rapid housing construction.  </P></p>

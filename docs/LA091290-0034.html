			<p><P> September 12, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> TERMS OF ESTRANGEMENT;  </P> <P> RELATIONSHIPS: THOUGH THINLY WRITTEN, CARRIE FISHER'S SCRIPT FOR 'POSTCARDS  FROM THE EDGE' CAPTURES THE COMPETITION AND LOVE BETWEEN A HOLLYWOOD MOTHER AND  DAUGHTER. MERYL STREEP AND SHIRLEY MACLAINE MAKE THE MIXED EMOTIONS BELIEVABLE.  </P> <P> "Postcards From the Edge"!? We should be so lucky. You can write something on a  postcard. This is more like fortune cookies; pithy, expert zingers from the  mother-daughter battlefield, Hollywood division: a star of '50s musicals  (Shirley MacLaine) and her movie actress-daughter (Meryl Streep) struggling  back from a drug habit that lifelong insecurity has built.  </P> <P> As Carrie Fisher has adapted her successful, somewhat autobiographical 1987  novel about the physical and psychological rehabilitation of a spirited,  wisecracking, just-turning-30 actress, she has taken one of the book's more  minor preoccupations, the mother-daughter stuff, and made it the movie's whole  shooting match.  </P> <P> "Postcards" (opening citywide) is a puzzlement. It's possible to float out of  it on the immense high generated by Meryl Streep's two final numbers -- singing  as affectingly as Bonnie Raitt. If it needed proving, it's clear now that there  is nothing Streep cannot do, except, possibly, oral surgery and high-platform  diving, and only a sucker would bet against either of those.  </P> <P> As director Mike Nichols speeds the movie by and Streep's Suzanne Vale gives  behind-the-scenes Hollywood the benefit of her wry eye and bad mouth, it's a  funny world to be let in on -- hip, inside and deadly clever. Unsurprisingly,  with this director and this writer, "Postcards" cuts close to the bone with its  insights about the workings of old and new Hollywood -- a past full of stars  with ironclad images built by studios and nourished by fan mags, and an  unsentimental and utterly forgetful present in which grosses alone are the  measure of success.  </P> <P> But apart from Suzanne and her egocentric mama, MacLaine's Doris Mann, who can  suck all the oxygen from a room with one dazzling, artificial smile,  "Postcards" is amazingly thin. Its subsidiary characters, The Director (Gene  Hackman), The Producer (Dennis Quaid) and The Emergency Room Doctor (Richard  Dreyfuss) have the depth of shrink-wrap.  </P> <P> Defiantly underwritten, onscreen for mere minutes, these anemics get what clout  they have from the sheer warmth and presence of their actors, a considerable  amount in the case of Hackman and Dreyfuss. Quaid, playing a character so  loosely sketched that it isn't clear whether he's a producer or Suzanne's  fellow actor, still seems to be flailing away like Jerry Lee Lewis, although  that song has ended.  </P> <P> As we first meet Suzanne, she's tailspinning, bluffing and snorting her way  through a crummy-looking movie about Latin American intrigue, directed by  Hackman. Next, she overdoses in the other half of Quaid's bed and finds herself  in a detox center, headed by a no-nonsense therapist played by C.C.H. Pounder  -- her power reduced to slivers of scenes. Improbably brief as the detox  section is, Streep gets memorable support from Robin Bartlett as her rehab  roomie Aretha ("I think my parents were expecting someone black"), whose dry  delivery and owlish take on life are the stuff on which lifelong friendships  are made.  </P> <P> Doris, a whirlwind of compulsive bossiness, arrives at detox, too, so  conspicuously self-effacing she's brought Woolite to rinse out a few of her  daughter's things. It's also clear that though she's judgmental about drugs,  she's a hard-working alcoholic herself, heightening the irony that, to work  again, Suzanne must live with her "responsible" mother. Screenwriter Fisher  further nails Doris when an ecstatic patient-fan burbles that he's wanted to be  her since he was 7. Doris hits the radiance button, then, under her breath to  Suzanne as they leave, says, "Sorry, but you know how much the queens love me."  </P> <P> With clear-eyed venom like this, or when they're characterizing slimeballs like  Rob Reiner's unctuous producer, Fisher and Nichols are unmatchable. Best of all  is the blistering irony behind MacLaine's musical high point, her own "Rose's  Turn," when Doris allows herself to be pulled center stage to perform at the  coming-home party she's thrown for Suzanne.  </P> <P> The number exposes every iota of support and competitiveness between mother and  daughter: the bitterness of Doris' refrain in Sondheim's "I'm Still Here," and  the ultimate professionalism of her delivery; the love and pride on Suzanne's  face watching her -- and her twinge as her mother exploits her daughter's drug  problems in public. If Doris complains that Suzanne won't use her singing  talent, there's no doubt why after mama's triumphantly brassy piano-top finale.  </P> <P> These and wickedly funny backstage snapshots of moviemaking are the good times  of "Postcards," but even they can't hide its emotional starvation. While we  chortle at the one-liners -- and Streep's running, grumbling delivery of them  -- the real work seems to happen too fast and offscreen. Drug rehabilitation,  family reconciliation, career regeneration. Peculiarly matched though Streep  and MacLaine seem as a mother and daughter, they wring every drop of empathy  from a last-minute hospital-bed scene of caring and contrition. Nevertheless,  "Postcards" is a quick-sketch of a screenplay whose details are still to come.  </P> <P> Even if it comes straight out of left field, Streep's performance as a country  singer at the movie's close is irresistible. Just let your mind alone at this  point; this is such unabashed fun that there's not much left to do but roll  with it, in the same way you can luxuriate in Michael Ballhaus' fluid camera  work, Patrizia Von Brandenstein's designs for the peculiarly awful movies  Suzanne is making, Ann Roth's wittily perfect costumes and J. Roy Helland's  superb hair and makeup, which in MacLaine's case is a devastating trip down  Memory Lane.  </P> <P> 'POSTCARDS FROM THE EDGE'  </P> <P> A Columbia Pictures presentation of a Mike Nichols film.

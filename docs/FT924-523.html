			<p>921224 FT  24 DEC 92 / Finance and the Family: Record fine for Scottish Widows LAUTRO, the life assurance watchdog, set again its record high for a fine this week. The culprit, was Scottish Widows, was fined Pounds 120,000 for failing to monitor its tied agents, and check that proper 'fact-finds' were being filled in on the financial circumstances of potential clients. The company has already been ordered to contact all the clients affected, and to pay full compensation if inappropriate advice is disclosed. Scottish Widows has attempted to contact all clients affected - there is still difficulty tracking some of them down - and no definite cases of wrong advice have been discovered. No compensation has been paid, but Newton Scott, Scottish Widows's manager of sales and marketing, admits there is 'a very small proportion who may have a compensation claim.' Lautro is also investigating the advertising for Scottish Widows' Monthly Income Bond, after complaints from advisers. If this is found to have been misleading, then Scottish Widows could be required to contact investors, explain the product and repay the amount invested if it no longer seems appropriate. This would mirror the action taken against two companies earlier this year for misleading advertising of with-profits bonds. In all, Lautro appears to have grown a particularly vicious set of teeth during the past year. The watchdog denies the fine is part of a 'get-tough' policy and says it reflects the severity of the offence. That is not how it has been interpreted elsewhere. The Consumers' Association welcomed the fine as a method of taking compliance seriously. The association says that the banks' life assurance subsidiaries, regulated by the Securities and Investments Board, could also benefit from the tenacious regulation being administered by Lautro.</p>

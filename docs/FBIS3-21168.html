			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Monju, Japan's first power generating FBR will reach  criticality in April 1994. This will mark the beginning of the  Age of the FBR, and PNC (Takao Ishiwatari, director), which has  been involved in FBR development, will begin construction on a  Recycling Test Facility (RETF) at the end of 1993 with the goal  of establishing FBR fuel reprocessing technology. Until this  recycling system is perfected, operation of the FBR, which  produces more nuclear fuel than it uses, will not go smoothly,  and the original purpose for the FBR, the efficient utilization  of nuclear fuel, will not be fulfilled. Other nations watching  developments at PNC, which leads the rest of the world, in this  area, quite closely.  <H5>  Purex Process Recycling </H5>   The RETF will confirm the technology for reprocessing spent  fuel from the FBR in a hot lab and provide necessary data for  the construction of a plant to be used in the Age of the FBR.  The basis for the system will be the same as that used at the  commercial reprocessing plant run by Japan Nuclear Fuel at  Rokkasho Village in Aomori Prefecture. It will use the wet  reprocessing format known as the Purex Process. The validity of  this method has been confirmed at CPF, PNC's high-level  radioactive material research facility, by processing fuel from  the FBR experimental reactor Joyo in hot tests since 1982.    When the FBR is in operation, three kinds of fuel that needs  reprocessing are formed--core fuel consisting of mixed uranium  and plutonium oxides, axial blanket fuel packed with depleted  uranium, and horizontal blanket fuel.    The RETF processing consists of disassembling the fuel  assemblies, cutting them up, dissolving the fuel, and isolating  and extracting the uranium, plutonium, and high level wastes  dissolved in the solution. Detailed design for this facility was  begun in 1988, and preliminary construction began in 1991.  <H5>  &yen;25,700,000,000 in Equipment Costs for 1994 </H5>   In 1988 PNC completed a recycling test wing consisting of  six  stories above ground and two below (total floor space about 3800  m[.sup]2[/]) at its Tokai Works at Tokai Village, Ibaraki  Prefecture, and it plans to begin hot tests there in 2000.  Construction costs for 1993 will be &yen;24,000,000,000, and  equipment and facility costs for 1994 are expected to be  &yen;25,700,000,000. The facility just received authorization  from the Nuclear Safety Commission in August (authorization to  alter the existing reprocessing plant).    Up till now, PNC has gained some insight on the practicality  of equipment such as a fuel assembly disassembly device that  uses a CO[.sup]2[/] laser for rapid and efficient removal of  the wrapper pipes covering the FBR fuel assemblies, a compact,  cylindrical, rotating continuous dissolving tank for rapidly  dissolving the cut-up fuel, and centrifugal purification  technology that uses centrifugal force to remove small particles  mixed in with the solution.    At the same time, PNC has finished technical development on  a  two-armed servo manipulator for performing various tasks and  routine maintenance of equipment by remote operation, and  engineers have also made decisions on devices that can perform  delicate tasks behind the equipment. PNC is also working on  development of automatic sampling technology and a sampling  robot.    If it handles only spent fuel, the processing capability of  the RETF equipped with this advanced equipment will be a maximum  of 1.3 tons annually (160 kg/day maximum, equivalent to 3 fuel  assemblies) in uranium and plutonium equivalents. If the  facility reprocesses both spent core fuel and spent blanket  fuel, the maximum processing capability will be 6 tons annually  (1 ton core fuel and 5 tons blanket fuel annually) in uranium  and plutonium equivalents.  <H5>  Stricter Protection Measures Needed </H5>   PNC believes that FBR fuel reprocessing development will  enter a new stage with the construction of this facility.  However, there are still problems to be overcome in developing  reprocessing technology. Stricter protection measures will be  essential because the amount of plutonium to be handled and  reprocessing costs will be greater than with LWRs.    Therefore, a major concern for a full-fledged reprocessing  facility is the pursuit of cost effectiveness. The RETF will  attempt to develop technology to reduce construction costs,  improve equipment operation and maintenance, and increase the  facility operating rate with the goal of attaining cost  effectiveness of less than 2.5 times the number of tons  processed. We can expect other goals to include technology for  the recovery and recycling of transuranium elements (TRU),  research to improve the Purex Process, and the introduction of  artificial intelligence and expert systems.</p>

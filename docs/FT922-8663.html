			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): International investors lift Paris and Zurich ACCLAIM for Paris, second-line speculation in Frankfurt and more new highs in Zurich competed for attention yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. PARIS continued to rise as international investors took the view that after the UK, France offered the best potential in Europe this year. Several brokers expect the CAC-40 index to reach 2,300 before the end of 1992. The index closed 14.09 higher at 2,077.49, another 1992 high, in good turnover of FFr3bn. Thursday's base rate cuts failed to sustain financials, as Paribas fell FFr11.90 to FFr435. Suez was the day's most active share, dropping FFr2.80 to FFr343.20. Schneider rose FFr38 to FFr745 while its subsidiary Merlin-Gerin jumped FFr33 or 6 per cent to FFr582 following a company roadshow. Pernod Ricard, the drinks company, rose FFr47 to FFr1,645 on a UK newspaper article which suggested that Grand Met might make a bid. A big UK buy order pushed Lyonnaise/Dumez up FFr12 to FFr571. Stock in Hachette was on offer as the price fell FFr7.40 or 5 per cent to FFr141. MMB, the holding company which controls Hachette, was suspended pending an announcement. FRANKFURT stayed quiet, but remarkably stable given high interest rates, strike worries and high money supply growth. The DAX index closed 4.85 higher at 1,753.03 after a 1.30 rise to 707.92 in the FAZ at midsession. Turnover rose from DM5bn to DM6.5bn. Continental, the tyre company, traded in an above-average DM46m as it fell DM11 to DM260. Weekend stories about a pending Conti rights issue of up to DM200m were revised yesterday: Conti said it wanted to create DM150m of new capital. However, Mr Hans Peter Wodniok of James Capel in Frankfurt said that while Pirelli SpA had officially pulled out as a bidder for Conti, there had still been speculation on an eventual Pirelli offer. The prospect of a Conti share issue made this highly unlikely, speculation cooled yesterday and the Conti shares fell; Capel's estimate of the intrinsic worth of the shares is DM200, indicating prospective current year and 1993 p/e's of 33 and 18 respectively. MILAN was driven lower by Pirelli's bigger-than-expected 1991 loss, announced late on Friday, and by fears that more rights issues were on the way. The Comit index fell through 490, regarded as an important support level, and closed 5.28 lower at 488.05, a new 1992 low. Turnover was estimated between L80bn-L100bn after Friday's L112.7bn. Pirelli dropped L47 or 3.3 per cent to L1,382 at the official fixing. But the Conti rights issue story pushed the price down to L1,355 after hours on fears that Pirelli would subscribe to its 40 per cent share in order not to dilute its stake, a move it could barely afford. Generali was also weak, losing L390 or 1.3 per cent to L28,800 despite efforts by Mediobanca to support the price. Ras savings shares, which failed to be fixed on Friday due to a trading imbalance, slumped L2,780 or 21 per cent to L10,480 as the fallout of its badly-timed rights issue continued. Stefanel, which has also announced a rights issue, fell L80 to L3,690. ZURICH continued to enjoy the rewards of a good blue chip results season, the SMI index rising 14.5 to a new high of 1,963.6 for the year. The chemical group, Sandoz, and major banks led the gains. Sandoz certificates topping the active list as they rose SFr130 to SFr2,880. Dealers said Sandoz had lagged behind the market and was now catching up with Ciba-Geigy and Roche. AMSTERDAM's CBS Tendency index advanced 0.3 to 130.4. Unilever and Royal Dutch both attracted strong overseas interest ahead of first quarter results due out later this week, rising Fl 3.20 to Fl 193.20 and Fl 1.20 to Fl 152 respectively. KLM was active in spite of denying weekend reports that an American airline might take a minority stake in the Dutch carrier. It closed up 90 cents at Fl 40.40, but off the day's high of Fl 40.60 with strong options related trading also noted. STOCKHOLM was again led higher by Volvo's strength and lower domestic interest rates. The Affarsvarlden General Index rose 4.8 to 1,014.5 as turnover eased to SKr677m from SKr853m. Volvo B unrestricted shares gained SKr6 to SKr451, on continued rumours of an early merger with Renault. VIENNA eased in low volume. The ATX index lost 1.18 to 970.65. Bank Austria preference shares fell Sch12 to Sch482 while its ordinary shares were unchanged at Sch1,040 after the bank last week invited preference shareholders to convert their shares into ordinaries. MADRID's general index closed up 4.03 at 259.04 in turnover of Pta22bn. UK institutional buying was seen in blue chips while optimism that there would only be a small rise in Thursday's inflation figures was an added boost.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                     FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - MAY 11                            Hourly changes  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  Open     10 am     11 am    12 pm   1 pm     2 pm     3 pm    close 1191.73  1191.78  1191.74  1191.34  1191.98  1192.28  1192.36  1191.63              Day's High  1192.84    Day's Low  1191.28         May 8        May 7       May 6      May 5       May 1       1188.95**     1182.52     1182.62    1178.23    1175.00**  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90). ** Partial.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

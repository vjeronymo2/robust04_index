			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Finance Minister Anne Wibble by </F> Monica Bjorklund; place and date not given: "Wibble Wants To  Save More -- Eventually"]    [Text] Saying that Sweden is on the right path but that  another 20 billion kronor in savings are needed over the next  few years for safety's sake, Minister of Finance Anne Wibble  (Liberal Party) presented the government's supplementary budget  yesterday.    The government wants to bring forward and expand its  reorganization of state finances. This time it is proposing  specific savings: a cutback in partial pensions. Next year's  budget -- for 1995-96 -- will strengthen the budget by 25  billion kronor. In all, the reorganization program will be  expanded from 80 billion to 100 billion kronor and extended  through 1999.    But the government is getting criticism from both the right  and the left for stating specifically how it plans to produce  those savings.    "We are unusually specific," Minister of Finance Wibble  objected when SVENSKA DAGBLADET met her for an interview. "The  custom usually is not to say anything about what one is going to  do in the future."  <H5>  From Pension System </H5>   The government specifies the areas where money is to be  saved. Much of the 25 billion kronor to be saved in 1995-96 will  be taken from the pension system.    The government had previously been thinking of saving nearly  6 billion kronor by raising the retirement age from 65 to 66  years. It dropped that proposal as a concession to the Social  Democrats during the pension negotiations.    Instead, the money will be found somewhere outside the  pension system. Wibble mentioned the early retirement pension  plan as one important area where proposed measures "will  gradually appear."    According to the reorganization program, another 5 billion  kronor are to be saved in the ATP [general supplementary  pension] system. In this case the government is even thinking of  increasing the employee contribution by 1 percent.  <H5>  Cannot Increase Contribution </H5>   Further savings yielding about 3 billion kronor are planned  in the unemployment insurance system. The minister of finance  declined to say whether these savings would also involve a  higher employee contribution.    "It is not possible to tack on just any amount of employee  contribution," she says. "I think that continuing to increase  employee contributions by another 1 percent every year is  overdoing it."    One item in the reorganization plan as presented earlier  will  not be moved up: the 2 billion kronor in reduced housing  subsidies.    "We are holding off on that because of the situation in the  housing market," Wibble says.    In addition to implementing the reorganization program more  quickly, the government wants to increase its amount by 20  billion kronor, a sum that will be saved in 1997-99. Here again,  the pension system will contribute a large amount, but the  minister of finance declined to say whether that would mean more  increases in employee contributions or anything else. She  pointed out that negotiations on the future pension system are  still under way with the Social Democrats.  <H5>  Says Nothing About the Rest </H5>   Savings in the pension system, combined with "unchanged  public consumption in real terms in 1999," account for 11  billion of those 20 billion kronor. For the time being, the  minister of finance is not saying anything about what the rest  of it will consist of.    We asked: "Is it because this is an election year that the  government does not want to say anything specific about future  savings?"    "No," the minister of finance answered firmly.    "This is specific enough for people to realize that the  government is not going into the elections on the basis of some  kind of pie in the sky. We are going into the election on the  basis of the two most important tasks concerning distribution  policy. One is not to shove the bill for the national debt off  onto those who are young today -- those of us who did the  spending will also pay. And the other is to pursue a policy on  business that will create jobs."  <H5>  Wants To Stop Increase </H5>   The government's goal is to stop the national debt from  increasing by the end of the 1990's. To do that, the  reorganization program must be carried out, and economic growth  must be at least 3 percent per year from 1996 to 1999.    "But it is clear that if Sweden votes no on membership in  the  European Union [EU], we will have to reexamine a lot of things,"  Wibble said.    According to the minister of finance, any tax reductions  next  year will have to be financed separately from the reorganization  program. And the tax reductions that may be considered will be  concerned primarily with further improving conditions for  business.    "Any tax reductions may well be financed within the tax  system. Or we may come up with some brilliant idea for savings,  but that seems much less likely, of course."    The fact that economic forecasts are now beginning to point  in the right direction is due partly to the devaluation. The  minister of finance admits this straight out.    "But it is due to a lot of other things as well: low pay  increases in the collective bargaining agreement, lower employer  social security taxes, lower energy taxes for industry, more  competition, and productivity gains by the firms themselves.    ``Without all the measures adopted by the government, the  outlook for the future would be very gloomy.''    Yesterday the Social Democrats presented a study of  distribution policy showing that since the nonsocialists came to  power, conditions have grown worse for all households without  large fortunes and access to stock ownership.    But Wibble is putting more faith in the Ministry of  Finance's  own calculations. They show that the gaps between the various  income groups have grown smaller.</p>

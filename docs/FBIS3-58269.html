			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] The Republican Assembly began to debate the  program of the coalition government of the Democratic Party and  the Republican Turkish Party.    First to address the Assembly was Dervis Eroglu, leader of  the main opposition National Unity Party [NUP], who described  the government program as a flippant and inconsistent list of  promises without an overall philosophy. This is not a program  that can serve the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus [TRNC] or  the Turkish Cypriot people, he charged, or that can defend or  advance the national cause in line with national interests. He  added: This program is not unified. It is full of  inconsistencies; it does not have political vision; it does not  foresee to uphold or to promote the TRNC. It is bound to fail.  It prefers propaganda to the implementation of policies.    The NUP leader alleged that the program will create problems  in the country, will bring confusion, and will help to destroy  the state mechanism. We will vote against this program, he  said, which does not protect the national interests of the TRNC  or of Turkey.    Eroglu went on to say that it is not yet clear what kind of  a  foreign policy the government will pursue. He alleged that the  coalition wants to pursue a daily foreign policy that it will  make up as it goes along. He noted out that the points made in  the government program are completely contrary to the  inalienable and basic principle on which the TRNC is founded.  He charged that the program does not foresee keeping the TRNC  alive. He said the program gives the green light to a unitary  state. Referring to the 1977 and 1979 summit agreements, he  said, the government program ignores the developments that have  taken place up to now and thus denies the rights gained so far.  The government is trying to make the press dependent on the  state, he said, and we view with suspicion the promise that  Bayrak Radio and Television will be granted autonomy.    The NUP leader pointed out that the promises made to civil  servants during the election campaign are not to be seen in the  government program. He charged that the government's economic  program will only bring new problems. Instead of developing a  free market economy, he said, the government is tying the  economy to the state again. We are pessimistic about the future  of the economy, he said.    Eroglu stated that while the coalition cooperation protocol  had said the state revenues and expenditures would be indexed to  foreign exchange rates, the government program takes a step back  from this principle. He added that the election promise of  reducing the duration of military service is also omitted in the  government program.    Addressing the Assembly on behalf of the Communal Liberation  Party [CLP], party leader Mustafa Akinci described the  government program as abstract, unclear, and indecisive. He  charged that the specific promises made during the election  campaign were diluted in the government protocol and become  completely unrecognizable in the government program. [passage  omitted]    Akinci said: Even though the Cyprus problem is the most  important problem, it seems that enough time was not allotted to  that issue during the efforts to establish the government.    Akinci pointed out that the confidence-building measures are  not mentioned in the program. On the other hand, he stressed,  the Greek Cypriot administration started extensive work on this  issue.    The CLP leader said the program has nothing on the issue of  a  federation or a confederation, and is inconsistent on the  territorial issues. The government must determine its Cyprus  policy before the vote of confidence, he added.    Akinci said the government program does not mention the  issue  of how to promote the TRNC in the world, or what the  government's views are on the issue of European unity. [passage  omitted]    The CLP leader concluded by saying that it is impossible for  his party to vote in favor of this indecisive program.</p>

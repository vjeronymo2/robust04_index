			<p><P> July 29, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> TROLLEY RIDE RISKS  </P> <P> Finally, an article ("Running Scared?" July 22) on the San Diego Trolley!  Although I was pleased to see a story regarding the trolley, I do not agree  with its basic conclusions.  </P> <P> The article states that statistically the trolley is extremely safe (.25  incidents of crime per 1000,000 passengers). As we all know, statistics can be  very misleading. What about all the unreported crimes that occur? For instance,  one incident which happened not too long ago involved two men in an argument.  The argument quickly evolved into an encounter in which one of the men pulled  out a knife and started waving it around. Terrified passengers pushed the red  emergency button several times to no avail. The trolley driver did not respond  and continued on his course in order to reach the next station. Fortunately, no  one was hurt, but this episode alone is enough to deter anyone from riding the  trolley.  </P> <P> Another episode, which I was a witness to, occurred at the Gaslamp (now 5th  Avenue) station. A lady leaving work was waiting for the El Cajon trolley.  While waiting, she was struck in the face and thrown to the ground by a  vagrant. The lady remained lying on the ground until she was taken away in an  ambulance. I can assure you that, if this lady still rides the trolley, she is  more than "somewhat apprehensive."  </P> <P> Langley Powell, president and general manager of San Diego Trolley Inc., states  that feelings and perceptions are almost as critical as statistics. Due to the  inaccurate nature of statistics, I would say that feelings and perceptions are  paramount. And the feelings and perceptions of San Diego trolley passengers are  far from favorable. While nothing has affected me directly, I do not feel the  trolley is "up to par" in terms of safety. After numerous conversations with  co-workers, I can assure you that my opinion is shared by several trolley  passengers.  </P> <P> The trolley is an essential transportation mode in today's world of  overpopulated freeways, yet necessity may be overtaken by fear as business  commuters return to the freeways. An added security measure which may dilute  some of the concern on the trolley is an intercom system in which all trolley  cars have direct communication with the driver. Intercoms are an integral part  of the new Los Angeles "Blue Line." I see no reason why San Diego should not  add this vital safety measure to their trolley system.  </P> <P> If statistically the answer is clear, perceptively the answer is also clear:  trolley commuters will continue "running scared" unless major changes take  place!  </P> <P> JENNIFER DREYER  </P> <P> La Mesa  </P></p>

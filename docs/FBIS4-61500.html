			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: Reports by </F> diplomatic correspondents Igor Porshnev, Vitaliy Trubetskoy, and  others]    [Text] Another round of Estonian-Russian talks began in the  village of Lohusalu near Tallinn on Thursday. Participants in  it will discuss the time for Russian troops withdrawal from  Estonia.    It's common knowledge that late last year Russia proposed to  conclude the withdrawal of its remaining 25 hundred servicemen  by August 31, on condition that social guarantees be granted to  Russian military retirees living in Estonia.    Tallinn views this demand as "overstepping the framework of  agreement and running counter to the bill on aliens adopted in  Estonia."    Lately Estonian diplomacy "discredited itself" in the  "Russian direction", a senior Russian diplomat in charge of  Baltic problems told Interfax.    As he said, realizing the futility of its attempts to "turn  the talks held on the level of governmental delegations in its  own favor, the Estonian leadership is increasingly active in its  efforts to raise them to the level of presidents."    "In fact, President Lennart Meri makes no secret of his wish  to come to Moscow and meet with Boris Yeltsin. However Russia's  attitude to this issue remains unchanged -- a meeting between  the two presidents can take place only if the Estonian side  agrees to sign the entire package of "military" agreements with  Russia. Apart from the main treaty on troops withdrawal, these  documents include an agreement on social guarantees for Russian  military retirees and their families. To Russia this agreement  is no less important than the treaty on troops withdrawal, but  Tallinn stubbornly refuses to sign it," the diplomat said.    According to him, "it's hard to expect any serious shifts"  from the present round of Russian-Estonian talks." "No  illusions should be nurtured in this respect. Estonian  diplomats drove themselves into a corner, and now they will find  it hard to get out of it," said Interfax's interviewee.</p>

Ministry officials said the guidance is designed to help  banking and nonbanking firms liquidate bad loans as quickly as  possible to promote economic recovery.    Financial institutions were urged to actively utilize  Cooperative Credit Purchasing Co. to rid themselves of bad loans  or high-risk loans, the officials said.    The company is a joint venture established by about 150  commercial banks and finance firms to liquidate bad loans.    The ministry also urged financial institutions to consider  transferring claims for which they have agreed to reduce or  exempt interest payments to affiliates.    The guidance will be incorporated in a comprehensive package  of pump-priming measures to be announced by the government in  the near future, the officials said.</p>

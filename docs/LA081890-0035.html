			<p><P> August 18, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> WHITE JOINS CAL AT PRACTICE AFTER GAINING HIS ELIGIBILITY  </P> <P> Trying to create an impact such as he could not make last year, running back  Russell White donned a Cal practice jersey for the first time Friday. The  Crespi High record-setter was ineligible to play football for the Golden Bears  last season under terms of Proposition 48.  </P> <P> "Everyone else wants to know, 'Who is Russell White and what can he do on the  college level?' " said White, who on Friday morning completed an English  requirement, his last obstacle to eligibility. "But I want to know myself."  </P> <P> White, who chose Cal over USC, established a state high school rushing record  of 5,998 yards at Crespi, including 2,339 yards and 31 touchdowns his sophomore  year.  </P> <P> On letter-of-intent signing day, White claimed that he could win the Heisman  Trophy his freshman year and eventually lead Cal to a Rose Bowl. But after  failing four times to score the minimum requirement of 700 on the Scholastic  Aptitude Test, he became a Prop. 48 casualty and was unable to participate in  practices or games until Friday.  </P> <P> "I was lost when I said that," White said of his signing-day boast. "I wish I  could take it back, but I can't turn back the clock."  </P> <P> Now a sophomore after losing a year of eligibility, White comes into Cal's  training camp third on the depth chart behind senior Anthony Wallace and  redshirt freshman Lindsey Chapman. Wallace ran for 560 yards last season.  </P> <P> White said that being a Prop. 48 casualty was the best thing that could have  happened to him.  </P> <P> "When I was coming here, I was going to finish (earn a degree), because that's  the way I've been brought up," White said. "Don't start something you can't  finish. If you don't have a degree from a university, you can't do much in  life. I want to eat sirloin."  </P> <P> The Bears, 4-7 a year ago, open their season at Wisconsin on Sept. 8.  </P></p>

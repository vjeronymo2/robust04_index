			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / EC offers to spend more to aid mining areas THE European Commission is prepared to spend more to help British coal-mining areas facing pit closures to create alternative jobs. In return, the commission says the UK government must settle the row with Brussels over how it accounts for such money. The offer is likely to bring pressure on the government in the wake of the job losses in the Yorkshire area announced this week, and claims that it is not using the means available to safeguard people's livelihoods in those and other threatened coal areas. Mr Bruce Millan, the EC commissioner for regional policy, said yesterday that Brussels had already allocated more than Pounds 30m to coalfields in the Yorkshire area under the Rechar programme to help declining coal regions. He 'was prepared to examine the possibility of increasing this allocation', but was 'still awaiting assurances from the UK government that when community funds are approved for particular areas they actually reach the areas concerned'. The commission has refused to disburse Pounds 109m under the Rechar programme, and has warned that about Pounds 880m in regional aid for Great Britain in 1992-93 is also 'in jeopardy', until Britain guarantees that the EC money is 'additional' to government and local government funding of projects. British Coal said yesterday it did not rule out reopening talks with Caledonian Mining, the unsuccessful bidder in the competition for leasing Monktonhall colliery near Edinburgh. That follows a report that Monktonhall Mineworkers, a company formed by redundant staff, had yet to complete its business plan and secure finance.</p>

			<p>920324 FT  24 MAR 92 / The FT Review of Business Books (16): An uneasy marriage TO THE END OF TIME by Richard Clurman Simon &amp; Schuster Dollars 23. 368 pages IT WAS one of the most curious marriages of the 1980s takeover wave - a little like a wedding between a prim New England intellectual and a hedonistic Californian rock star. On the one side was Time Inc, the world's largest magazine and book publisher, and inheritor of the stern didacticism of Henry Luce, who built a great journalistic empire on a mission to inform the American public. Its top management ranks were filled with White Anglo Saxon Protestants who had been carved into shape by the right East coast schools. On the other was Warner Communications, a popular entertainment giant with interests ranging from films to rock records which had been built, says author Richard Clurman, on two primary business objectives: 'making money and having a good time doing it.' Steve Ross, its creator and chairman, had come a long, long way from his beginnings as the director of a New York funeral parlour, and in the process become one of America's most controversial businessmen: his pay was colossal, his business background was chequered and a little murky, but his unctuous manner charmed everyone. 'Steve,' one long-time rival is quoted as saying, 'has this uncanny quality of making you feel sorry for him even when you think he's screwing you.' The basic thesis advanced by Clurman, a former chief of correspondents for Time, is that Ross well and truly screwed Time's management, seducing them into what was supposed to be a merger of equals which preserved the precious Time culture, on terms which brought Warner out comfortably on top. Both sets of managements were encouraged in their deal-making by compensation packages of extraordinary generosity, with Ross himself netting more than Dollars 200m (Pounds 113.6m). Certainly, the dominance of Warner in the conjoined culture was graphically underlined last month when Nicholas Nicholas, the senior manager from the Time side, was forced to step down as co-chief executive and heir apparent to Ross. He was replaced by Jerry Levin, another Time alumni, but a man closer to Ross and, reputedly, with a better feel for the film business. It is hard to argue with Clurman's contention that Ross ran rings round Time's management, which had floundered throughout the 1980s in search of a successful business strategy. Their existing magazines were in mature markets and their efforts to establish new ones all aborted, mostly notably the embarrassing TV-Cable Week, an instant dud. Time owned a cable television channel, Home Box Office, which Levin had built up in the 1970s. As the management flailed about in search of a strategic home-run, a succession of consultants suggested that the future lay somehow in video. Clurman does a workmanlike job of describing Time's search for a partner, its selection of Warner and the ensuing three-way battle when entertainment group Paramount launched a counter-bid for Time. But the book provides few original insights into Ross's background and personality, or his business record. And it is superficial and patchy in its analysis of the commercial and technological rationale that was supposed to underlie the creation of the world's biggest media company: the convergence of printed and video images in a single medium wired into the home. This entertainment smorgasbord is almost certainly coming, but its economics remain uncertain. So too does the rationale for having its software providers (publishing, film and record businesses) under the same roof, not to mention the conduit for the information (cable operators like Time Warner) or hardware companies (such as electronics group Toshiba, which plans to take a stake in Time Warner's film and cable business). The rationale for the merger, then, remains unproven. And its first two years have also thrown up a succession of management misjudgments which have raised eyebrows on Wall Street, notably an ill-conceived share issue aimed at reducing the mountain of debt which the merger piled on top of the business. The tone throughout Clurman's book suggests that the merger was bad for Time, not merely in financial terms but in the destruction of Henry Luce's tradition, with its mission to inform and its clear distinction between 'church' (its journalists) and 'state' (its management). Yet, while quoting senior Time executives as being 'apprehensive,' Clurman advances precious little evidence of direct interference in editorial policies, and acknowledges that many within the organisation have been pleasantly surprised by Ross. At the same time, he suggests that there is increasing pressure by the group's management to take Time down-market to increase its sagging circulation. 'It was obvious,' he quotes one editor as saying, 'that the business guys thought we were a bunch of nerds, policy-makers, putting out a pseudo-intellectual magazine about world affairs full of what they call 'homework.'' The charge remains unproven, and Time Warner executives insist that the prestige of its magazines business is central to the group's being. But in a nation whose television is already among the worst in the Western world, and where educational standards are falling, the Luce tradition may simply be a worthy anachronism.</p>

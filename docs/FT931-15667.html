			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / Auntie sent to management school: The BBC faces a reshaped bureaucracy as the BBC has been affectionately known for many decades - has been sent to management school. Mr John Birt, the new director-general, yesterday set out a 35-page blueprint on how to turn an institution famed for its bureaucracy, and once likened to the Indian Civil Service, into 'a model public service.' There will be 'focus, devolution of responsibility and involvement', Mr Birt promised. There was a need to clear away territoriality, red tape, confusion of purpose and strategy and organisation charts 'criss-crossed confusingly with dotted lines'. Mr Birt said he wanted an institution where managers never stifled initiative or enterprise, where bureaucracy was a dirty word and where 'fudge and fix-it, hostile leaking and secretive and manipulative behaviour become techniques and tactics of the past'. To realise his dream, Mr Birt set out a programme for change and reorganisation and announced new recruits to the board of management, including Mr Bob Phillis, the chief executive of Independent Television News, who will become deputy director-general, and Ms Liz Forgan, director of programmes at Channel 4, who will be managing director of BBC Network Radio. Mr Birt also announced the creation of a number of new committees. The main structural changes include: The streamlining of the corporate centre so its main job is to set strategy, define policy and monitor performance. A new directorate bringing together resources, engineering and services. Separating programme production from commissioning and scheduling in television and radio to reflect the move to independent producers. A single directorate covering World Service Television and World Service Radio. A new, separately managed archive unit to hold the rights to BBC programmes. Normally, these rights would be exploited by BBC Enterprises, the commercial wing of the BBC. Apart from his role as deputy director-general, Mr Phillis will be responsible for World Services activities until they are merged. A new managing director of BBC world services will report to him as will the managing director, resources - a directorate to be run by Mr Bill Dennay until his retirement this spring. Mr David Hatch, managing director of BBC Radio, will become adviser to the director-general and Mr Tony Hall, as managing director, news and current affairs, and Ms Patricia Hodgson, as director of policy and planning, will join the board of management. A programme strategy review will be set up next month, chaired by Ms Forgan and helped by Mr Alan Yentob, the BBC2 controller, to produce and publish a programme strategy for the corporation. A programme of 'market testing of support services' will begin, and the establishment of a review of best practice in working methods will be followed by productivity targets. Mr Birt is also instituting an annual performance review in every area of activity to make the BBC more efficient and accountable. 'The annual performance review will be the flywheel that drives the BBC and keeps us alert and self-questioning about everything we do,' he said. Mr Ron Neil, managing director of regional broadcasting, will lead a group to recommend how the annual performance review should work in practice and implement it. Managing directors will examine the scope for rationalising programme departments in radio and television - the bi-media approach - and within the next few months a commercial policy framework for the BBC will be published. Asked if the new committees were not the very essence of the bureaucracy he had vowed to end, Mr Birt said: 'Bureaucracy is what you have when you have very unclear lines of responsibility. 'You need people to sit astride a wide range of functions. It was very necessary in the eastern bloc because of the absence of anything else. All we are doing is clarification.'</p>

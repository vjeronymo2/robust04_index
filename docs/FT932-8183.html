			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / 'Dirty matters' denial by Nissan A SENIOR executive of Nissan, the Japanese carmaker, yesterday denied that his company was behind the alleged tax fraud involving Nissan UK, the former car importer. Mr Masayuki Sakagami, managing director of Nissan Motor Corporation Carriers, the Japanese company's freight subsidiary, was giving evidence at the Old Bailey trial of Mr Michael Hunt, the Nissan UK director who denies conspiring to cheat the Inland Revenue of Pounds 97m in corporation tax. Mr Sakagami denied knowing of the role in the alleged fraud of Mr Friedrich Pannosch, an Austrian rail consultant accused of being party to it by opening a Swiss account into which about Dollars 200m in charges allegedly diverted from Nissan UK were paid. When Mr Sakagami and two other senior Nissan executives met Mr Pannosch in Vienna for a weekend in early 1990 their purpose was simply to be taken for a sightseeing tour - not to 'check out' Mr Pannosch because they knew he had opened the account, he told Mr Michael Sherrard QC, for Mr Hunt. He denied evidence given earlier in the trial by Mr Pannosch that the Nissan executives' trip had not been a cultural tour of the city and that they had spent 20 hours a day pumping Mr Pannosch with endless questions about his business. Mr Sakagami said that throughout the weekend the Nissan executives had only asked questions about Austrian history and painting. Mr Sakagami said that he was shocked when he eventually learnt of the role played in the alleged fraud by Mr Pannosch. 'We have absolutely nothing to do with dirty matters,' he said. The trial continues today.</p>

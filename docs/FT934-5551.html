			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / Doubts on value of exam grades Employers will need to seek new ways of testing job applicants because of uncertainty about the validity of school examination grades, Professor Clive Fletcher, professor of psychology at London University's Goldsmith's College, says today. He writes in Personnel Management, the magazine of the Institute of Personnel Management, that changes in the educational system in England and Wales are likely to lead to a greater reliance on psychological tests in recruitment. He says that the record A-level results of the summer and the improvement in GCSE results for the sixth year in succession have led to uncertainty in some employers' minds about whether standards were genuinely higher or assessment standards lower. Differentiating between grades, given the greater prevalance of higher grades, he suggests, will lead to a search for other, additional ways of assessing intellectual capacity. Prof Fletcher warns employers that they should shop around for the best tests. Tests of 'doubtful quality' remain on the market and too few people are trained to use the good tests properly.</p>

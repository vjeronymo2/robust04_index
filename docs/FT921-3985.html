			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / International Company News: AEG sells office equipment unit AEG, the Daimler-Benz subsidiary, has sold the remnants of its domestic Olympia office equipment division to Mr Jurgen Sievers, a consultant called in last year to advise the German engineering company on how to get rid of the loss-making business. Mr Sievers will take over at the end of this year when the planned run-down of manufacturing at Wilhelmshaven in north Germany is completed. The company, currently AEG-Olympia, will be re-named Olympia Office. The handover ensures the survival of one of the oldest brands in office equipment although most of the jobs that Olympia provides will go.</p>

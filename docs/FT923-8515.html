			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / Call for more advice over debts MORE independent financial advice is needed to help with personal debt, according to the National Consumer Council, which is calling on the government to take the lead in providing funding. The council says that more than 500,000 households are struggling with multiple debts but only one in seven debtors can expect to receive expert money advice. In a report published today, the council says that government appeals to the credit industry to fund centres on a voluntary basis have largely failed. Ms Ruth Evans, a council director, said: 'If necessary, (the government) may need to impose a statutory levy on the credit industry, for instance. Or maybe they should promise to match, pound for pound, voluntary contributions from the private sector.' The council said: 'The Department of Trade and Industry must ensure that adequate funds are available to meet the need for money advice services. This includes funding for front-line staff, specialist support staff, training and computer support.' The DTI said it opposed a statutory levy. Debt advice should be funded by the private sector and it would continue to encourage the financial sector to provide such funding. Money Advice Centres: Final report and recommendations for funding. Money Advice Funding, National Consumer Council, 20 Grosvenor Gardens, London SW1W ODH. Pounds 2.50.</p>

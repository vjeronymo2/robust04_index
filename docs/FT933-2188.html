			<p>930920 FT  20 SEP 93 / Foreign Exchange and Money Markets: Awaiting M3 CURRENCY dealers will focus on the performance of the dollar/D-Mark exchange rate this week, with key data coming out in both countries, writes James Blitz. Few dealers expect any change in official interest rates at this week's Bundesbank council meeting, which is set to be Mr Helmut Schlesinger's last as president. However, there have been several indications that M3 money supply data for August and consumer price inflation for September have both been somewhat lower than expected, raising expectations that the Bundesbank will ease policy more quickly than anticipat-ed. The M3 data could come out at any time from today. Dealers had been expecting the figure to be well above 8 per cent because of the huge intervention by the Bundes-bank to support European exchange rate mechanism currencies last month. However, Mr Schlesinger strongly hinted last week that the outlook for M3 may be better than the market expects. Consumer prices data for the German Lander are also due throughout this week. Some analysts are optimistic about the outlook for German inflation, suggesting that it could be as low as 4 per cent for western Germany this month. In the US, the only data that might affect the dollar are the durable goods orders for August, due on Friday. The market consensus is for a month-on-month rise of 1.5 per cent. In the UK, today's M4 lending figures for August, due today, could have a significant impact on the pound. The market appears to be expecting M4 lending to have been Pounds 2.5bn - but a lower figure could increase the speculation about a base rate cut before the end of the year, which was gaining ground at the end of last week.</p>

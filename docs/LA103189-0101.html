			<p><P> October 31, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BIDDER EMERGES FOR AILING DETROIT PAPER  </P> <P> An investor group has offered to buy the Detroit Free Press for $68 million as  lawyers prepared for oral arguments in the U.S. Supreme Court in a case  involving a joint operating agreement with the Detroit News.  </P> <P> William D. McMaster, head of the Michigan Investor Group, made the bid to buy  the Free Press in a letter Sunday to James K. Batten, president of  Knight-Ridder Inc., which owns the newspaper.  </P> <P> "The Michigan Investor Group, if successful in purchasing the Free Press, will  continue the 158-year-old Detroit Free Press as an ongoing enterprise and will  convert the editorial format to a 'statewide community newspaper,' " McMaster  said in a news release.  </P> <P> The owners of the two newspapers, Gannett Co. and Knight-Ridder, have said the  JOA would force layoffs and a price increase. Knight-Ridder has said it will  sell the Free Press or close it if the JOA is denied.  </P> <P> Officials at Knight-Ridder's Miami headquarters were reviewing McMaster's  letter this morning and could not immediately comment on it, corporation  spokeswoman Heidi Etzold said.  </P> <P> Oral arguments were heard Monday in the JOA case.  </P> <P> "It's the time when all the elements of the case will converge, all the people  involved will be together for the last time," said William Schultz, an attorney  for JOA opponents.  </P> <P> The Supreme Court justices may vote on the JOA this week, but their decision  isn't likely to be made public until next summer.  </P> <P> Eight of the nine justices will vote. Justice Byron R. White withdrew from the  case citing personal reasons. A 4-4 tie would uphold the JOA.  </P> <P> The court may uphold two lower-court approvals of the JOA, reject the merger or  instruct Attorney General Richard Thornburgh to reconsider the decision.  </P> <P> Schultz represents Michigan Citizens for an Independent Press, a group of  readers, advertisers, weekly newspaper Publisher W. Edward Wendover, former  News columnist Matt Beer and state Sen. John Kelly (D-Detroit).  </P> <P> The Detroit Free Press, which declared itself a failing newspaper in May, 1986,  filed under the Newspaper Preservation Act of 1970 for permission to merge with  the Detroit News. A JOA allows newspapers to combine business operations but  maintain editorial independence.  </P> <P> McMaster said he hoped to complete the purchase of the Free Press by the end of  the year, provided the newspaper supplied the group with statements on its  operations and assets.  </P> <P> Opponents say the merger is prompted by greed and would hurt smaller area  newspapers. Some question the independence of the two papers under a JOA.  </P> <P> "If this JOA is upheld, we will see the end of competitive journalism in this  country by the end of the century," said Louis Mleczko, a News reporter and  president of Local 22 of the Newspaper Guild.  </P></p>

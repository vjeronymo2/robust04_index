			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: Derivatives lift FT-SE indices to new peaks - Market Report All the UK market's leading stock indices powered ahead to record highs yesterday as a sudden burst of big buying interest in the FT-SE 100 March future, plus a persistent story that a cut in UK interest rates may be imminent, caught marketmakers short of stock. The suddenness and weight of buying interest in the Footsie future caught dealers on the hop and transformed the market, with the leaders, Mid 250 stocks and the smaller companies' shares all rallying strongly from an initial bout of weakness and gathering pace throughout a dramatic session. The FT-SE 100 Index ended a net 38.8 up at an historic closing high of 3,520.3, having peaked at 3,520.4 only minutes before the close of trading. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, which has regularly outperformed its senior index, finished 45.5 up at a peak 4,150.9. Dealers lowered share prices at the outset of trading, with the FT-SE 100 around 10 points easier following the modest falls on Wall Street and Tokyo overnight. The market was widely regarded by dealers as being overblown and most marketmakers were said to have been short of stock overnight. Little in the way of selling pressure was noted for much of the morning, but dealers remained happy to absorb any stock that came on offer. The FT-SE 100 at the day's low was down 13.7 at 3,467.8. The sudden appearance of a buyer of around 2,000 FT-SE 100 contracts, said to have been Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, was the catalyst for a searing upsurge in the futures and the cash market. By the time Goldman's business was completed, the future had risen some 20 points, driving the cash market sharply better. The purchase of 2,000 FT-SE 100 contracts was estimated to have pumped some Pounds 175m into the market. The cash market's response was immediate. The 100 index accelerated all day and peaked just two minutes before the close. Second line stocks were also chased sharply higher, with dealers aware that tomorrow sees the start of trading in FT-SE Mid 250 derivatives, both futures and options, on the OMLX Exchange in London. The Liffe market's Mid 250 Index futures contract is being launched on February 25. The head of trading at one of the leading UK integrated houses said: 'There was no obvious catalyst for the market; no lead from gilts or economic data. It was purely futures-led and hit a market expected to go lower.' He added that institutions still underweight in equities had tried to buy the cash market but were unable to do so at realistic prices. Consequently they were pressured into buying the future, which in turn dragged up the cash market. 'We are climbing a wall of fear,' commented one marketmaker. The rate cut story impacted strongly on utilities, and particularly on the electricity stocks, which offer above average yields. Turnover in equities reached 1.0846bn shares, with non-Footsie stocks accounting for 68 per cent of the total. The value of customer business transacted on Tuesday was Pounds 2.165bn. Bank shares saw the two Far Eastern-influenced stocks, Standard Chartered and HSBC Holdings, stage another big leap forward, the latter boosted by the covered warrant issued by BZW and the former reflecting talk of imminent and substantial upgrades. Lehman Brothers, the US investment bank, was said to have upgraded Abbey National, National Westminster Bank and Barclays.</p>

			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Flotation for Ind Brit Healthcare Independent British Healthcare, which has 17 hospitals spread between Stirling in the north and Tunbridge Wells in the south, is coming to the market early next month. The group, which is expected to have a market capitalisation of about Pounds 45m, will be raising approximately Pounds 20m of new money through a placing. It will be used to reduce the net debt of about Pounds 37m, cutting gearing from some 130 per cent to 45 per cent. Net assets are Pounds 28m. The company, which makes 80 per cent of its income from private medical insurance, opened its first hospital in 1983 - a converted country house in Chorley, Lancashire, with 15 beds. Mr Keith Chadwick, chief executive, said yesterday that local consultants had spoken of the need for a private hospital in the area. Both the consultants and local businessmen put money into the initial venture, which lost Pounds 45,000 in the first year, but made Pounds 140,000 on turnover of Pounds 726,000 in the second year. Mr Chadwick and his co-founder Mr John Lyons, a chartered surveyor, continued to expand, setting up three companies under the Business Expansion Scheme and two with institutional money. Earlier this year the five companies were merged into one group. There are now 2,400 shareholders, many of them doctors. The two founders each own 11.5 per cent of the equity. Mr Chadwick is not selling any shares, and expects to have about 6 per cent after flotation. Mr Lyons is selling two-thirds of his stake. Pre-tax profits for the year ending September are expected to be about Pounds 2.2m after paying Pounds 3m of interest. The group will pay no tax because of accrued capital allowances. Beeson Gregory is both sponsor and broker to the issue.</p>

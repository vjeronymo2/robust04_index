			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / Major calls for ERM reform: PM backs Lamont in row with Kohl  -Bank of France intervenes as franc falls THE WAR OF WORDS between Britain and Germany following the collapse of sterling intensified yesterday as Mr John Major called for a reform of the European exchange rate mechanism. In his first interview since the pound was withdrawn from the ERM, Mr Major implicitly backed Mr Norman Lamont, chancellor of the exchequer, who had earlier become embroiled in sharp exchanges with Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany over who was responsible for this week's turmoil on the currency markets. The British prime minister argued there were structural 'fault-lines' within the ERM that needed to be tackled. In one remark clearly aimed at Germany, Mr Major said: 'We have to make sure that monetary policy is run in the interests of all the countries of Europe and not veered to the national interests of any individual country.' Moreover, in words which will be interpreted as support for Mr Lamont in his attack on Germany, he insisted the UK would not return to the ERM until it was reformed and until Denmark clarified how it intended to proceed after its No vote on the Maastricht treaty on European political and monetary union. Asked how soon that might be, Mr Major replied: 'Clearly, it is not imminent.' He said the chaos in the markets had stemmed from 'a good deal of Europe' being caught between low dollar exchange rates and very high interest rates in Germany. 'This is a problem far apart from the British government. It is a problem which has stretched right across the European Community - and outside it.' Mr Major gave notice that the mechanics of the ERM would have to be reviewed, possibly at a heads of government summit to follow Sunday's French referendum on Maastricht. Downing Street confirmed last night that such a meeting was being considered. The prime minister's intervention came after an extraordinary clash between Mr Lamont and Mr Kohl that looked set to sour still further the already strained relations between Britain and Germany. Earlier in the day, Mr Lamont had openly fuelled the tensions by placing the blame for the week's events firmly at the Germans' door. 'We want to be satisfied that German policy that has produced many of the tensions in the ERM is going to have some changes that will lead to a more stable environment,' he said. In Italy, Mr Kohl issued a swift public rebuke to Mr Lamont for making Bonn the scapegoat, describing his comments as 'inappropriate for a minister'. Mr Hans Tietmeyer, Bundesbank deputy president, denounced UK criticism as unfounded. 'I think there were certain comments, which were not exactly characterised by 'fair-play',' he said. 'But when one is in a difficult position then such a reaction is sometimes also understandable,' he added. Mr Amato had shrugged off suggestions that Italy had bowed to the dictates of Germany by referring to puppet shows watched by three- and four-year-olds. 'There is always the good guy being beaten with a stick by the bad one,' he said. Mr Kohl said in relation to Britain's attitude to Germany: 'Similar considerations apply.' Both men reiterated their faith in the Maastricht treaty's vision of economic and political union despite the week's turbulence which forced Britain and Italy to float their currencies outside the ERM. Mr Kohl endorsed Italy's call for a summit to reassess developments in the Community. It emerged that Italy might be having second thoughts about its ability to comply with Thursday's commitment to rejoin the ERM next Tuesday.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Relayed by TV Polonia Network] </F>   [Text] I am convinced that there will be joint maneuvers of  our troops and North Atlantic Pact troops before the year is  out, Minister of National Defense Piotr Kolodziejczyk said after  meeting U.S. Ambassador Nicholas Rey. The meeting was the first  opportunity to put into effect the agreements signed during the  minister's U.S. trip. A joint defense affairs commission will  be set up in May. It will tackle, among other things, the  restructuring of the Polish arms industry.    [Correspondent] The representatives of both states talked  about the possibilities of making practical use of the  Partnership for Peace in military cooperation betwen both  states, and the issue of security in our part of the world.    [Begin recording] [Rey in English fading into Polish  translation] We have specifically discussed the possibility of  joint maneuvers. Such an undertaking requires a detailed plan.  We will be working on it.    [Kolodziejczyk] We are presenting the whole range of  training  undertakings we will implement this year, which are being  implemented by the Polish Army, and the U.S. side will indicate  which undertakings it wishes to take part in. All this will  require the appropriate preparation, also on the staff side, so  that there will be no disharmony. This means harmonizing the  communications networks, the command systems, on some sort of  chosen scale, and this will be the first very important step,  very important experience for our Polish Army. [end recording]    [Correspondent] Ambassador Rey mentioned the proposal that  the Americans should finance a modern air navigation system but  did not give any specific information on when and how this would  come about.</p>

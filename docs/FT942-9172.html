			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / International Company News: Profits advance of 10.3% for Generale des Eaux Compagnie Generale des Eaux, the French industrial group, yesterday said it was on course for continued profits growth this year after achieving a 10.3 per cent increase in net profits to FFr3.2bn (Dollars 550m) last year from FFr2.9bn in the previous year. This was in spite of continued losses from its cable television and property interests. The group, which has significant media interests as well as its core construction and utility activities, surpassed analysts' expectations. Generale des Eaux yesterday said it was 'certain' to raise its profits again this year, but added that it could not give precise indications as to the likely figure. However, the group did specify that it expected to see its turnover rise modestly to between FFr150bn and FFr155bn in 1994, from FFr147.6bn in 1993. Such an increase would repeat last year's rate of 2.9 per cent sales growth from FFr143.3bn in 1992. The group said it expected a 'slight reduction' in the level of activity of its construction interests, but stressed that the overall outlook for these businesses was showing signs of improvement. It also forecast an improvement from its property management activities.</p>

			<p><P> June 6, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PIC 'N' SAVE WINS MORE TIME TO FIGHT HOSTILE BID  </P> <P> The Pic 'N' Save retail chain won more time to resist a takeover threat when a  federal judge late Tuesday ordered the Girard Partners investment group to  disclose more information about itself.  </P> <P> Girard, headed by La Jolla financier David H. Batchelder, is trying to gain a  majority on Pic 'N' Save's board and then buy the company itself or auction the  chain to the highest bidder.  </P> <P> But U.S. District Judge Robert C. Bonner ordered Girard, before resuming its  efforts to win the support of Pic 'N' Save shareholders, to supply the names of  its limited partners.  </P> <P> The judge, after an all-day hearing, also demanded that Girard file with the  Securities and Exchange Commission more information about the employment  history of Robert J. McNulty, a retail executive who is one of the investors in  Girard.  </P> <P> Under the order, Girard cannot resume soliciting the support of shareholders  until 10 days after the required information is filed. Bonner also delayed Pic  'N' Save's annual meeting from June 20 to July 2.  </P> <P> Girard has proposed a slate of nominees, including Batchelder and McNulty, for  election to Pic 'N' Save's board at its annual meeting. The company has  countered Girard's efforts by putting itself up for sale, and trying to  persuade shareholders that it could do a better job than Girard of maximizing  the value of its shares.  </P> <P> Dominguez-based Pic 'N' Save is a chain of 190 stores -- mainly in the West,  the South and the New York area -- specializing in closeout and other discount  merchandise.  </P></p>

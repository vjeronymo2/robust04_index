			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One SHA recommended simplifying the policy by replacing the separate faulting criteria for jointed plain and jointed reinforced concrete pavement (JPCP and JRCP) with a single faulting criterion in mm/km (inches/mile) for both pavement types. A mm/km based criteria would eliminate the need to take joint frequency into account, as the average allowable faulting per joint would be directly related to the number of joints/mile. The FHWA recognizes the merit in this recommendation and has replaced the separate faulting criteria of 3 mm on JPCP and 6 mm on JRCP with an equivalent maximum faulting rate of 525 mm/km (33 inches/mile) for both. This faulting rate is equivalent to 3 mm per joint on typical JPCP with 6 meter (20 foot) joint spacing and 6 mm per joint on JRCP with 12 meter (40 foot) joint spacing. Because joint spacing varies between States, the allowable faulting per joint will differ from State to State, even though the faulting rate per km remains constant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Administrative_Procedural Tolerance Limits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The most common comment, received from seven SHAs, was that the scope of the application of the criteria was too stringent. The crux of the argument was that some tolerance limit should be established to allow a SHA in substantial compliance to transfer funds. A common suggestion was that the FHWA only require that 90 to 95 percent of the Interstate System meet the criteria before allowing transfer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FHWA recognizes that there are continually evolving pavement and bridge needs and, at any one point in time, even SHAs with exceptionally good pavements might not meet the criteria on 100 percent of their Interstate system. The FHWA has already provided relief for this situation. The interim policy specifically allows transfer when all criteria are not met on the Interstate if the work necessary to correct any deficient segments is included in the approved State Transportation Improvement Program, required by 23 U.S.C. 135(f). This relief is included in the final policy. The FHWA believes that allowing a 5 to 10 percent exemption or tolerance would be unwise, as it would allow transfer of money necessary to maintain the Interstate highway system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Pavement Data Collection  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several SHAs posed comments and questions on data collection and reporting procedures. The primary concern appeared to be whether FHWA would require a specific data collection effort using some standardized equipment and procedures that would be different from what is currently used by the individual SHAs. Further, the comments included request for flexibility in summarizing the data. Several suggested that FHWA should use whatever SHA PMS data was available to determine the acceptability of a certification accompanying a transfer request.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FHWA intends to rely primarily on current surface roughness, rutting, and faulting information contained in SHAs PMS database(s) and from information reported in HPMS in evaluating the pavement component of State certifications accompanying Interstate maintenance fund transfer requests.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FHWA recognizes the uniqueness of each SHA's PMS and the diversity of equipment and procedures used by the SHAs to meet their particular pavement management needs. The FHWA is not prescribing new specific uniform data collection equipment, procedures, sampling, or data reduction techniques to determine compliance with the pavement Interstate maintenance transfer criteria.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Bridges  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Only two SHA's commented on the bridge section of the policy. Both endorsed the use of the current National Bridge Inventory (NBI) bridge deck condition rating (Item 58) as an indicator and supported the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> criteria requirement that bridge decks have a condition rating of 5 or better. This is consistent with the long standing use of a deck rating of less than 5 to determine a structurally deficient bridge.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Both States also recommended that FHWA include the NBI ratings for superstructure and substructure in the policy and delete the load posting requirement contained in the interim policy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FHWA originally considered using superstructure and substructure ratings as specific criteria when it initially developed the interim policy. Upon further consideration, FHWA still supports ``load posting'' criterion which reflects superstructure and substructure condition ratings and is also a measure of potential safety concern.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The need for load posting is an end result of applying superstructure and substructure conditions, along with other factors, in making load carrying capacity calculations. Changes in condition ratings, and therefore, the load posting, are affected by a reduced maintenance effort which eventually leads to continual and long-term deterioration of bridge elements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One of the SHAs further recommended that the FHWA incorporate failure susceptibility as an indicator. Failure susceptibility is not required nor normally assessed by States in the course of inspecting bridges to meet national bridge inspection standards. As a result, the FHWA believes it would be inappropriate to use failure susceptibility as a nationwide criterion in the IM fund transfer policy, and has not included it.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, one SHA recommended that bridge railing adequacy should be included in the decision factors. The FHWA considered including bridge railing adequacy as indicated by NBI Item 36 in the early development of policy criteria. The NBI Item 36 is a four segment item that rates bridge railings for adequate impact strength, and approach guardrail for adequate vehicle safety and protection.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The adequacy of bridge railings and approach guardrail is a serious safety concern and should be considered in the States' maintenance program as well as in developing highway safety projects.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Bridge Data Collection  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NBI ratings are determined in accordance with the ``Recording and Coding Guide for the Structure Inventory and Appraisal of the Nation's Bridges'' (Coding Guide) U.S. DOT/FHWA, December 1988.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Policy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For the purpose of 23 U.S.C. 119(f)(1), which provides for transfer of State apportioned IM funds that are in excess of a State's need to the State's NHS and STP apportionment, the FHWA will accept a State's certification if the State's Interstate routes meet the following criteria:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Pavement:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (1) An IRI of 200 cm per km (127 inches per mile) or less; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> December 22, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UC IRVINE FALLS IN OVERTIME TO LOYOLA OF CHICAGO  </P> <P> UC Irvine Coach Bill Mulligan started his sixth different lineup Thursday night  against Loyola of Chicago, and it started out no better than the previous five.  </P> <P> If anything it was worse, at least in the first half.  </P> <P> The Anteaters, with two freshmen and a gimpy point guard starting, went  scoreless for the first three minutes before Jeff Von Lutzow, one of the  freshman, made a layup.  </P> <P> They trailed by 16 at one point in the first half, rallied to force overtime in  the second, then lost, 78-72, before 1,437 fans in the Bren Center.  </P> <P> It was the second consecutive defeat for Irvine (2-7).  </P> <P> Keir Rogers had 35 points and Keith Gailes 28 to lead Loyola (3-3). Every time  Irvine came close, Rogers or Gailes made a key field goal or free throw.  </P> <P> Irvine tied the score, 66-66, but missed two chances to win in the final  seconds of regulation.  </P> <P> Rod Palmer's eight-foot shot in the lane was short. Justin Anderson rebounded,  but his off-balance shot bounced off the rim as the buzzer sounded.  </P> <P> In overtime, Loyola scored first on free throw by Rogers and never trailed.  </P> <P> Rogers' three-point play put the game out of reach, 72-67.  </P> <P> Gailes made four free throws in the final minute to seal the victory.

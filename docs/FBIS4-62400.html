			<p>BFN     [Text] President Geydar Aliyev received CSCE Minsk Group  Chairman Jan Eliasson and Vladimir Kazimirov, President  Yeltsin's special envoy, today. Aliyev welcomed his guests and  said that he highly appreciates the role of the CSCE Minsk Group  and the Russian Federation in the effort being made to resolve  the Karabakh dispute. He said: The talks have entered a new  stage. We have held talks with the leading officials of the  CSCE Minsk Group and the representatives of the Russian  Federation on the solution to the Karabakh problem. The  significance the CSCE Minsk Group and the Russian Federation  attach to the ending of the Karabakh dispute is in conformity  with the laws. However, I am convinced that more work can be  done if the CSCE Minsk Group and the Russian Federation adopt a  common approach on the solution of the problem. We believe that  more effective measures have to be taken and an optimal approach  has to be adopted for the ending of the dispute.    Jan Eliasson stressed: We have reached a formative  [preceding word in English] and responsible era in the effort  being made to resolve the Karabakh dispute. A new opportunity  has been created for the solution of that problem. We are  convinced that a cease-fire must be implemented as the first  step and then international observers must be sent to the  disputed zone. We have agreed on those matters with the Russian  leaders in Moscow and the CSCE's leading officials. We have  also informed the UN Security Council. A group of international  observers is ready to leave for the disputed zone. We need  official approval on that matter. A [words indistinct] is being  drawn up for the work of the observers. Later, measures will be  taken in stages.    Vladimir Kazimirov said that he highly regards Jan  Eliasson's  views. He said: Russia is very interested in the resolution of  the dispute and the establishment of peace. The sphere of our  [word indistinct] and relations is very wide. The military  units must withdraw from the occupied areas and problems related  to the exchange of prisoners of war, refugees, and other issues  must be resolved after the cease-fire agreement is implemented.    President Aliyev said that he is convinced that the  initiatives made by the CSCE Minsk Group and the Russian  Federation will quickly yield results and that the [words  indistinct] will be realized.    Rasul Guliyev, chairman of the Azerbaijan National Assembly;  Foreign Minister Gasan Gasanov; and Vefa Gulizade, state adviser  on foreign policy, attended the meeting.</p>

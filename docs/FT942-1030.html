			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / Kohl rattled as protege falls at the last fence: Paris and Bonn need to be a little more sensitive toward their partners One of the casualties of the Corfu summit was Chancellor Helmut Kohl. He pushed hard for Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene to succeed Mr Jacques Delors as president of the Commission, only to see the Belgian premier stumble at the last fence. Mr Kohl clearly saw Mr Dehaene as something of a protege. Here was a politician without pretensions, skilled in the art of compromise, a fervent supporter of the need for deeper political and economic integration in Europe - in short, a man in the chancellor's own mould. After Mr Dehaene, Mr Kohl's recent track record on personnel matters is looking mixed. Mr Steffen Heitmann, the right-wing justice minister from former East Germany, was his first choice for president of the Bundesrepublik; but he was forced to bow out after ill-judged remarks about the Holocaust. On Saturday afternoon, there was little disguising Mr Kohl's pique as he fended off questions about his own role in the Delors succession. He was particularly sensitive about why he favoured Mr Dehaene over the more experienced Mr Ruud Lubbers, Dutch prime minister. 'I don't have to explain this,' said Mr Kohl. The chancellor also betrayed irritation at suggestions that France and Germany had tried to push through their candidate without proper consultation - a suggestion which Mr Lubbers raised shortly after declaring his own candidacy last month. Mr Kohl retorted on Saturday that it was absurd to talk about Franco-German hegemony in the European Union. The idea was 'mad' and 'primitive', he said. Yet the impression of a Franco-German diktat on the Delors succession gained force last month after the Franco-German summit in Mulhouse, the traditional high-level meeting in which Bonn and Paris seek to co-ordinate positions ahead of the EU heads of government summit. At Mulhouse, officials leaked the fact that Mr Kohl and President Francois Mitterrand had agreed to put forward Mr Dehaene as joint candidate. The officials described the decision as one of a series of joint positions on important EU matters such as deregulation and the future integration of central and eastern Europe. One of the broader lessons from the Delors succession affair is that Paris and Bonn need to be a little more sensitive toward their partners, even as they draw closer to one another in the cause of European integration and are eager to show the outside world that the Franco-German axis remains secure in a Union in which Germany's weight is growing. Mr Jose Manuel Durao Barroso, Portuguese foreign minister, summed up the mood among several other delegations. France and Germany were too big countries whose co-operation was vital for the Union, but 'we do not like the way this has been handled'.</p>

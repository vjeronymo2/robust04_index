			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / US and N Korea endtalks in Pyongyang The US and North Korea yesterday ended 'serious and co-operative' talks in Pyongyang on setting up liaison offices as a first step to diplomatic relations. The US is offering improved links in return for North Korea accepting full international nuclear inspections and stopping its nuclear programme. The discussions in Pyongyang, which began on Saturday, have focused on technical matters such as selecting a location for the US office in North Korea. A decision on whether to proceed with the offices will come after the US and North Korea resume high-level talks in Geneva on September 23 to settle the nuclear dispute. North Korea allowed International Atomic Energy Agency experts access to a previously-closed fuel fabrication plant. The US and North Korea meet in Berlin this week to discuss ways to deprive Pyongyang of the ability to produce weapons-grade plutonium.</p>

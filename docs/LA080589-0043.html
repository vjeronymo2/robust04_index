			<p><P> August 5, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GINGRICH BLAMES 'ENRAGED' DEMOCRATS FOR ALLEGATIONS  </P> <P> Rep. Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) defended himself Friday against growing allegations  of House rules violations, saying that the charges come from "enraged"  Democrats led by "an almost irrational" Rep. Bill Alexander (D-Ark.).  </P> <P> Gingrich, the House minority whip, told a television interviewer that Democrats  have vowed revenge since he spurred the ethics case that led to the resignation  of House Speaker Jim Wright (D-Tex.) in June.  </P> <P> "I think there are people who are enraged that I insisted on investigating Jim  Wright, and I think, frankly, they will try to do virtually anything to try to  prove that you can't stand up to that kind of power and get away with it," he  said on ABC's "Good Morning America."  </P> <P> Alexander already has filed a complaint against Gingrich with the House Ethics  Committee and said Thursday he is preparing to amend the charge to include as  many as 200 additional rules violations.  </P> <P> Gingrich dismissed the threat Friday, saying: "I think in terms of the  substance of the charges, what you have is an almost irrational Democrat in  Bill Alexander who is wandering around wildly saying things. I'm comfortable  that after the Ethics Committee has investigated it that they are going to say  that there's nothing to the charges."  </P></p>

			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / International Bonds: Spanish bank deals keep French franc sector alive The French franc sector of the eurobond market saw further activity yesterday as two Spanish banks followed Abbey National's FFr2bn issue on Wednesday. Santander International launched a FFr2bn offering of 10-year bonds, priced to yield 43 basis points above the underlying French government bond. Joint lead manager JP Morgan reported strong demand from French institutional investors and institutions in the UK and Germany. Argentaria Global Finance brought a smaller offering to the shorter end with a FFr1.5bn issue of three-year bonds priced to yield 38 basis points over the underlying French government bond. The deal met good demand in France from institutional investors, lead manager Credit Lyonnais said. The proceeds were believed to have been swapped back into pesetas. 'International demand is returning for French francs, with particularly attractive spreads against Germany,' said one syndicate manager. 'The market has dropped quite a bit recently so that it is now at very interesting levels for investors across the whole of the yield curve.' Ford Credit Canada brought a CDollars 150m offering of five-year eurobonds destined for retail investors in Switzerland and the Benelux countries, lead manager Wood Gundy said. 'With CDollars 1.6bn due for redemption in October, investors are beginning to look for new products in the Canadian dollar market,' said one syndicate manager. The bonds were priced to yield 40 basis points over the underlying government bond. Syndicate managers reported some unexpected retail demand from Hong Kong. Swedish Export Credit launched a Dollars 150m issue of three-year eurobonds, bought entirely by lead manager Swiss Bank Corporation. SBC said the bonds were mainly taken up by Swiss retail investors. The spread on the bonds was believed to be around 17 basis points over Treasuries. Zeneca, the bioscience group demerged from ICI last year, has filed a shelf with the US Securities and Exchange Commission for an amount of Dollars 750m. It incorporates a medium-term note programme lead-managed by Merrill Lynch.</p>

			<p><P> June 4, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GARDENS: AN OLD PEPPER;  </P> <P> IN THE QUINTESSENTIAL CALIFORNIA GARDEN, THE INHABITANTS AREN'T NECESSARILY  NATIVES  </P> <P> IT IS NOT OFTEN CALLED by its botanical name, Schinus molle, perhaps because,  said aloud, it might sound like a sneeze followed by a polite apology. One  reference suggests skye-nus as the way to pronounce it.  </P> <P> We call it the California pepper, believing it to be native to this state. Down  under, it is called the Australian pepper, locals there apparently making the  same assumption. Brought here from its homeland in Peru, it was one of the  first trees cultivated in California by the Mission fathers, and it has been  here long enough to have given us some remarkably gnarled specimens. One,  identified by some as the oldest, is being enclosed in a newly refurbished  garden at the Mission San Luis Rey de Francia, the most affluent of the old  missions, located between San Juan Capistrano and San Diego. Another notable  planting is an official Historic-Cultural Monument for the City of Angels --  the pepper trees, planted in the 1920s, that overhang Canoga Avenue from  Ventura Boulevard south to Saltillo Street. And another street collection has  added some notoriety to the pepper's resume: the peppers lining Euclid Avenue  in Upland -- trees that a few years ago began to rot and drop heavy limbs on  passers-by.  </P> <P> The pepper pictured here is also quite old but new to its garden. Found growing  in a vacant lot and estimated to be 35 to 40 years old at the time, it was  moved here to give the garden an "understated and established" look, according  to the landscape architects Jerry Cummings Associates.  </P> <P> The garden is as distinctively Californian as the pepper tree; that is, none of  the plants are natives, but they are enthusiastically at home here just the  same. The pepper's tallest companions are pigmy date palms and giant  bird-of-paradise. The bold accents to the left are cycads (commonly called Sago  palms), and to the right, agapanthus. All of these nearby plantings are  drought-resistant, as is the pepper, which can survive on rainfall alone.  (Peppers can tolerate soil with poor drainage as long as the soil does not get  too wet.)  </P> <P> Azaleas make up most of the shrubbery in the garden. The prettiest is a Gold  Cup hybrid named 'Baby Jill,' which makes the pink clouds in the distance  beneath the giant bird-of-paradise. They in turn are set off with plantings of  purple and blue cinerarias in winter and New Guinea impatiens in summer, a  scheme developed by the master gardeners who care for the property, Patrick  Turnbull and Collie Valadez.  </P> <P> The paving is porous (broken concrete with Bermuda grass planted in the gaps)  to ensure that air and some water get to the tree's far-reaching roots. Peppers  are susceptible to root rots, and to ensure that this tree does not receive too  much water, nothing is planted within a 6-foot radius of its base, and  sprinklers are aimed away from the trunk. At first the presence of azaleas  seems to reflect a mistake in planning a drought-resistant scheme designed to  protect a tree that doesn't like too much water. However, azaleas actually need  far less water than they are usually given. Here they are a good 10 feet away  from the trunk, and both the azaleas and the cinerarias get regular  irrigations.  </P> <P> The roots of pepper trees grow near the surface and can pose a problem, another  reason that nothing is planted at the very base of this tree. Peppers should  definitely be kept away from sewers and sidewalks.  </P> <P> As for the heart rot that brought the notoriety to the peppers of Upland, that  can be prevented if all large pruning wounds are sealed promptly and properly.  Peppers also are prey to a tiny psyllid; this particular tree is sprayed  commercially twice a year with Dursban.  </P> <P> Another complaint heard about California peppers is that they drop a lot of  litter -- tiny branches, leaves and peppercorns. But in this garden, the litter  is effectively absorbed by the plantings underneath. I remember trying to  bicycle to school down a street lined with old peppers -- no small trick  considering the billions of peppercorns that made the street as unstable as a  linoleum floor covered with ball-bearings. Offsetting that recollection are  memories of the pleasant dappled shade the trees cast on hot September days and  the wonderfully warm smell of peppercorns crushed by the balloon tires on a  Schwinn Cruiser.  </P> <P> Some people would say that the pepper tree's susceptibility to rots and  psyllid, its aggressive roots and its messy manner make it a poor choice for a  garden. But when properly sited, what else has such grace and grandeur, with  its dainty leaves and its slender, weeping branches draped from massive,  gnarled limbs?  </P></p>

			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / L'etat - c'est lui: The mounting political crises of President Mitterrand French president Francois Mitterrand has said the Habash affair is over. Yet the political crisis in France caused by the brief hospitalisation in Paris last week of the Palestinian leader Mr George Habash will not quickly be forgotten. Today, the government faces an opposition censure motion in a one-day session of parliament called by the president to try to put the crisis to rest. Mr Mitterrand has dismissed the Habash incident as a minor failure of political judgment by a few civil servants. The harsh truth is that the episode has exposed serious weaknesses in the 'Mitterrandian' state, and has inflicted more damage on an already seriously discredited administration. The summary dismissal last week of four top-ranking officials at the foreign and interior ministries failed to silence the controversy. All the political parties were incredulous that the decision to admit Mr Habash could have been taken without ministerial authority, and are scandalised that civil servants should be made the scapegoats for their political masters. Some leading politicians, and not just in the conservative opposition, demanded that ministerial heads should roll. The most spectacular such demand came from Mr Michel Rocard, the former Socialist prime minister, long an open challenger of Mr Mitterrand's position and the Socialist party's most likely candidate in the 1995 presidential elections. In a television interview, he dismissed as 'highly implausible' the claim that ministers had not been kept informed, and went on: 'We are not at the end of this affair, and I am not satisfied. There is an eminent political responsibility behind this error.' Mr Rocard's open repudiation of the government's handling of the Habash affair is obviously intended to strengthen his presidential credentials. He was clearly voicing the moral dismay of many other leading party members, and distancing himself from a president whose administration looks alarmingly accident-prone. His open disloyalty to the president could yet harm him in the long run. But in the short run, President Mitterrand had already decided not to sacrifice any of his ministers. Some French commentators have protested that Mr Roland Dumas, the foreign minister, and Mr Philippe Marchand, the interior minister, ought not to have been able to shirk their personal responsibilities and allow their civil servants to carry the can. The fact is, however, that the France of the fifth republic does not appear to recognise the principle of personal ministerial responsibility. Very occasionally, a political rebel may resign from office on grounds of personal principle. But in general, loyal ministers are expected to place their portfolios absolutely at the disposal of the president; if they resign, it is only because they have been dismissed. In the notorious Greenpeace scandal of 1985, it quickly became obvious, in spite of denials, evasions and an elaborate whitewash report, that the sinking of the Greenpeace ship Rainbow Warrior was the work of French secret service agents. When the facts could no longer be denied, there was a struggle behind the scenes between Mr Laurent Fabius, the then prime minister, and Mr Charles Hernu, the then defence minister, to decide which of them would take the blame. This struggle lasted more than two months before Mr Hernu was forced to resign. In the Habash affair, no such political sacrifice has been demanded. Indeed, even the exemplary sanctions meted out to the civil servants may be largely illusory, and have more to do with the theatre of politics than with real punishments. Mr Roland Dumas, the foreign minister, declared on Tuesday that his great esteem for these 'exemplary' public servants was undiminished, and that he would not rest until they were restored to positions of equivalent rank. According to Mr Serge July, editor of the newspaper Liberation, the Habash scandal epitomises a crisis of political irresponsibility which is inextricable from the pronounced personal idiosyncrasy of the Mitterrand regime. In an editorial this week, he traced this crisis to Mr Mitterrand's 'freemasonry of friendship', his habit of filling key political positions with personal friends and loyal associates, such as Mr Dumas and Mr Marchand. The corollary is that none of President Mitterrand's ministers has any personal authority except through him. Mr Dumas and Mr Marchand have no political power of their own, because they owe their positions solely to the grace of the president. Therefore they have no personal responsibility. The principle of political impotence may also apply to prime ministers. When Mr Rocard was prime minister, he submitted to President Mitterrand's will; but he remained a figure of political weight and authority, since he controlled a large faction of the Socialist party. By contrast, Mrs Edith Cresson, his successor, has no independent power base, and is thus little more than the creature of the president. The first result of the 'presidentialisation' of political power is that ministers cannot, or at least should not, make any significant policy innovation without the endorsement of the president. The second is that their ministries are far more sensitive to the policy indications which emerge from the Elysee Palace than to the views of their own titular ministers. This practice of obsessive 'Elysee-ology' offers the most plausible explanation for the Habash affair. The foreign and interior ministries knew that the request to hospitalise Mr Habash came through the French Red Cross; they knew that Mrs Georgina Dufoix, president of the French Red Cross, was also an adviser and long-time associate of Mr Mitterrand; so they may have assumed the endorsement of the president. After today's debate, President Mitterrand no doubt hopes that he can resume his previous medium-term plan of campaign. This was to keep the present government in office at least until after next month's regional elections. If the results turned out to be really bad for the Socialist party, he could appoint a new prime minister, who might still have enough time, and above all sufficient popular appeal, to regain ground for the Socialists before the general elections in the spring of 1993. The one man who is regularly canvassed as such a potential white knight for the Socialists is Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission. He has strong European and French political credentials, and he is right at the top of the popularity charts. But even were he prepared to throw up everything at a call from President Mitterrand, he could not reasonably abandon his responsibilities in Brussels at a moment's notice. The earliest plausible moment for a measured change of government, therefore, would be in the late spring. This means that Mrs Cresson can almost certainly expect to have to soldier on for six weeks or more, until after the March 22 elections; indeed, it is not impossible that she may have to stay on as prime minister until the general elections next year, if Mr Mitterrand concludes that a better candidate is not available. This mid-term scenario helps to explain why Mr Rocard and his allies in the Socialist party were suddenly so keen for an immediate government reshuffle, or even for a new government, in response to the Habash affair. If Mr Delors were able, in suitably measured circumstances, to become prime minister some time in the spring, he might also be able to use the office to challenge Mr Rocard's position as the presidential candidate of the Socialist party. If, on the other hand, President Mitterrand could be bounced by the Habash affair into making a sudden government reshuffle now, he could not realistically make a second reshuffle six weeks after the regional elections. Mr Rocard had ethical and political reasons for demanding a reshuffle; but he also saw it as a way of blocking a potential challenge from Mr Delors. For the time being, however, Mr Rocard and Mr Delors are figures on the sidelines. The central lesson of the Habash affair is that, ultimately, only one person in the whole of the constellation of government has any power, and only one person is really responsible for anything; and that is the president himself. He created the conditions for the Habash debacle through the presidentialisation of power; and he turned the affair into a crisis, first by treating it as a scandal, and then by attempting to stifle the scandal. Of course, he cannot himself be punished when things go wrong; but in the end he cannot escape responsibility, and one day there will be a reckoning.</p>

			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / Broker accused of making false statement A STOCKBROKER falsely told Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, in October 1990 that Maxwell Communication Corporation was about to file for bankruptcy, it was alleged at Knightsbridge Crown Court yesterday. Mr Andrew Collins QC, prosecuting, said Mr Peter Marks, a director of Branston and Gothard, made the statement, which he had known was untrue, to try to lower the MCC share price and make money for himself on dealings in the shares. Mr Marks has pleaded not guilty to a charge under section 47 of the Financial Services Act of making a misleading, false or deceptive statement to induce share dealing. Mr Collins said that soon after 8am on October 12 Mr Marks telephoned Mr Graham Ward, a Goldman Sachs marketmaker in London, and agreed to sell him 100,000 MCC shares at 136p. Three minutes later Mr Marks rang again and asked Mr Ward to call him back on a line on which calls were not tape-recorded. The return call was made by Mr Ward's superior, Mr Timothy Medland, whose recollection was that Mr Marks had told him that Mr Robert Maxwell would be filing for bankruptcy for MCC that day, or words to that effect. Mr Collins said: 'What was conveyed was a statement of fact that Maxwell was effectively going bust that day.' Shortly afterwards Mr Marks again telephoned Mr Ward and agreed to sell him a further 100,000 MCC shares at 133p. Mr Marks then bought 200,000 MCC shares at 134p to fulfil the sales. Mr Collins said Goldman Sachs had been one of the main buyers of Maxwell shares. If it had suddenly marked them down the price might have been expected to fall. Mr Ward said that in September and October 1990 Goldman Sachs had in general been buying, and as the MCC price had gone down Mr Ward had bought the stock on the instructions of a Goldman Sachs partner in New York. Cross-examined by Mr Anthony Scrivener QC, for Mr Marks, Mr Ward agreed that on October 12 Goldman Sachs had held 23,433,708 MCC shares and that dealing records appeared to show that on that day 1m MCC shares had been sold within Goldman Sachs. Mr Collins intervened to say the 1m shares had been sold to Goldman Sachs New York. Mr Medland said he had passed on what Mr Marks had told him to Mr Eric Sheinberg, Goldman Sachs managing director in New York. Mr Scrivener suggested to Mr Medland, now a stocktrader with Swiss Bank Corporation, that Goldman Sachs had 'a special relationship' with the Maxwell organisation. Mr Medland agreed. He said Mr Sheinberg had been the only person with authority over a special Maxwell share account. The trial continues today.</p>

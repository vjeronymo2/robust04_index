			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; The Family (At a Glance): Scottish Life cuts pension costs Scottish Life has reduced the administration charges on its Talisman personal pension scheme, with a resulting enhancement in benefits. At the same time, it is introducing a so-called Retirement Investment Strategy which is designed to be more suitable for pensioners' needs. Contributions in the early years will be fully invested in UK equities in order to get maximum growth. As the individual gets within 15 years of retirement, money will be switched into a managed fund. In the last five years before retirement, the fund will be switched into fixed interest and deposits for maximum safety.</p>

While development is the goal and  reform the motive force, stability is the guarantee. Since the  start of this year, the province has deepened reform; expanded  opening up; and maintained sustained and rapid economic growth  as well as basic social stability. The province's overall  situation has remained fine to date. Nonetheless, we have also  come across a host of problems and difficulties.    Secretary Xie Shijie called for paying more attention to  some  outstanding economic problems and grasping a number of current  key work aspects. He said: First and foremost, we should try  to stabilize grain output; readjust the agricultural structure;  produce more model units good at increasing grain output and  achieving a comparatively well-off livelihood; and push ahead  with agricultural and rural economic growth; second, we should  try to integrate reform with construction; energetically  readjust the industrial structure, the product mix, and the  enterprise structure; reduce losses sustained by enterprises;  and raise industrial economic efficiency; third, we should make  redoubled efforts to secure more foreign investments, develop  export trade, and expand opening up to the outside world;  fourth, we should strive to invigorate circulation, increase the  effective supply of commodities, and place more commodity prices  under market control; and fifth, we should strive to make every  possible endeavor to make the best of the province's limited  funds.    Secretary Xie Shijie stated emphatically: As public opinion  has always had an important bearing on the overall interests of  the party and the state, we should persistently maintain a  correct public opinion orientation; implement correct public  opinion principles and policies; bring into full play the role  of the market; improve party leadership over public opinion;  make public opinion serve and promote overall work and dispel  pessimism; strictly distinguish between two different types of  contradictions; and carry out political and ideological work of  a mass character on a more extensive scale.    Secretary Xie Shijie called on party organizations at all  levels across the province to further step up ideological  building; arm all party members with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's  theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics; build  more competent leading bodies; become good at guiding economic  as well as other types of work; energetically build grass-roots  party organizations; further enhance the unifying force and  combat effectiveness of each and every grass-roots party  organization; carry on the current deep- going anticorruption  struggle; vigorously improve party style and build clean  government; go deep into reality to carry out investigation and  study; cultivate a pragmatic work style; carry out down-to-earth  work; work hard and live a plain life; and actively guide the  broad masses of the people to participate in the socialist  modernization drive.</p>

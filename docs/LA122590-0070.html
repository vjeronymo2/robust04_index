			<p><P> December 25, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GROWERS TAKE STOCK OF LOSSES AS FREEZE WANES  </P> <P> As a slow warming trend took hold across California, agricultural inspectors  spent Monday in citrus groves, vegetable fields and packing houses trying to  define the dimensions of the devastation that struck the state's frost-bitten  agricultural industry over the weekend.  </P> <P> Most of what they discovered was not encouraging.  </P> <P> In Tulare County alone, where the bulk of California's navel oranges are grown,  Agricultural Commissioner Lenord Craft was estimating a $200-million loss in  this year's harvest, which could translate into a $700-million loss for the  local economy. In Ventura County, destruction of nursery stocks, lemons and  avocados totaled at least $100 million, said Deputy Agricultural Commissioner  Jim Fullmer.  </P> <P> Even in urban Los Angeles County, agriculture officials said the chill caused  at least $500,000 in damage, mostly to landscape bushes and flowers. "It could  reach $1 million or $2 million easily," said Bob Donley, deputy director in the  agricultural commissioner's office.  </P> <P> Agricultural officials said San Diego and Orange County growers apparently were  spared major damage.  </P> <P> The Arctic air mass which brought the freeze is slowly dissipating, forecasters  said, granting a brief reprieve for the Christmas week, with temperatures in  Los Angeles expected to stay in the the 60s. The Civic Center high on Monday  reached 65, 10 degrees higher than the day before.  </P> <P> But forecasters say another cold front may be on the way. It is now riding  along the Canadian Rockies and into Alaska.  </P> <P> "It's fairly stationary, but it's getting ready to make a move," said  meteorologist Steve Burbach of WeatherData Inc., which provides forecasts to  The Times. Burbach predicted the next frigid blast will hit Northern California  over the weekend, arriving here early next week.  </P> <P> Burbach added, however, "It won't be as widespread or as difficult to combat."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, California continued Monday to feel the effects of the "Arctic  Express," as one National Weather Service forecaster dubbed the front that  swept in four days ago.  </P> <P> The low at the Los Angeles Civic Center was 35 degrees -- two degrees above the  record low for the date set in 1879, said Weather Service meteorologist Jerry  Steiger. Records were broken, however, in San Francisco with a low of 32, in  Oakland with a low of 34 and in San Jose, where the mercury dropped to 23  degrees.  </P> <P> The icy conditions have taken a toll not only on business but on human lives as  well.  </P> <P> Two possible hypothermia deaths were reported by the Los Angeles County  coroner's office. The body of a 47-year-old man was found Saturday in his  mobile home in the northeast San Fernando Valley and an elderly woman was  discovered the next day in her garage in the Wilshire area. Orange County  authorities also reported that a 57-year-old transient died of hypothermia in  Anaheim.  </P> <P> Two unidentified transients died in a fire in a vacant auto repair shop in  South-Central Los Angeles on Monday night after they had built a fire in a  large metal container to heat the building where several men reportedly lived,  authorities said.  </P> <P> Neighbors said the men usually built fires outside in the metal drum, but cold  weather apparently forced them inside.  </P> <P> Fire officials said cause of the blaze in the 5000 block of South Vermont  Avenue was under investigation. Two other men in the structure at the time of  the 7 p.m. blaze were not injured.  </P> <P> In the Antelope Valley, Thomas Hunsaker, 21, was killed after he lost control  of his car, which hit an ice patch and skidded into a light pole at 17th Street  and Avenue K in Lancaster, sheriff's deputies said. Temperatures there had  dropped to 5 degrees.  </P> <P> Another measure of the cold came from the Southern California Gas Co. The  utility reported that Friday's natural gas consumption of 5.3 billion cubic  feet set an all-time high in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Farther north, in the Santa Cruz Mountains, a severe water shortage apparently  was caused by people running their faucets to prevent frozen pipes.  </P> <P> Burst pipes were a common complaint from Napa Valley wineries to the Los  Angeles Equestrian Center in Burbank. Sheriff's officials in the Antelope  Valley reported receiving 200 to 300 calls a day from people seeking help with  their plumbing.  </P> <P> "We just tell them to go out and shut off the water, and call a plumber," said  Deputy Ronald Giddings.  </P> <P> As for food industry officials, they were still trying to gauge agriculture's  losses and what impact they may have on consumers. Most said it is still too  early to tell.  </P> <P> Buyers for the 104-store Stater Bros. chain said they don't know whether they  will have enough winter fruit and produce to meet demand.  </P> <P> "We're evaluating ads that we are running in the next two weeks to be sure we  will have what's advertised," said Stater Bros. Chairman Jack H. Brown. "If  not, we will have to pull them and substitute other items."  </P> <P> Importers of Chilean fruit expect demand to pick up for their product as  grocers seek to make up for lost California supplies.  </P> <P> David Oppenheimer &amp; Co., which imports Chilean fruit, expects a cargo ship  loaded with nearly 2 million pounds of Chilean peaches, plums, nectarines and  other fruits to arrive Thursday at the Port of Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Until the weekend, the state had been projecting a crop of 80-million, 37  1/2-pound cartons of navel oranges for the season, which runs from October  through April of 1991. And 46-million cartons of Valencia oranges were expected  from March through December or January, said Ron Radenz, a statistician for the  California Agricultural Statistics Service.  </P> <P> Sunkist Growers Inc. cooperative spokeswoman Claire Peters said that  preliminary estimates indicate that 50% of the citrus crop may have been  damaged. Some of the damaged crop, however, may be salvaged for juice, she  said.  </P> <P> About 20% of the avocado crop was lost to the cold front, said Mark Affleck,  president of the California Avocado Commission. The state produces 90% of the  nation's avocados.  </P> <P> Still, he said, the 1991 harvest may be higher than the 200 million pounds  picked in 1990.  </P> <P> Flowers may also be affected. If there is much more cold weather, Valentine's  Day bouquets "may cost you a little extra," said Marilyn Corodemas, chief  deputy agriculture commissioner for San Diego County, where the most flowers in  the state are grown.  </P> <P> At the San Gabriel Nursery in Los Angeles County, the frost caused at least  $200,000 damage and perhaps much more, according to Douglas Darrow, a company  salesman.  </P> <P> Contributing to this story were staff writers David Ferrell, Nieson Himmel,  Penelope McMillan and Jesus Sanchez in Los Angeles; Tom Furlong in Orange  County; John Rivera in the Antelope Valley; Pysche Pascual in Ventura County;  Linda Roach Monroe in San Diego; Jonathan Weber in San Francisco and  correspondent Mark Arax in Fresno.  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 2, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON;  </P> <P> CITY MAY BUY SITE FOR ELDERLY HOUSING  </P> <P> The City Council on Tuesday will consider buying property for apartments for  low-income senior citizens.  </P> <P> The owner, First Lutheran Church of Fullerton, is willing to sell the  23,800-square-foot site on East Amerige Avenue for about $750,000, said Terry  M. Galvin, the city's redevelopment manager.  </P> <P> A few old houses, including a rare two-story Victorian house, and a small  apartment are on the property now. The city and the church would share the cost  of finding new homes for current renters, he said.  </P> <P> The city would try to find someone to buy and move the Victorian house because  of its historical value, Galvin said.  </P> <P> The council will consider signing an option to buy the property and authorizing  its staff to find a developer to build the apartment building.  </P> <P> Fullerton would sell the property at a low price with the condition that rents  forever be kept affordable to low-income seniors, Galvin said.

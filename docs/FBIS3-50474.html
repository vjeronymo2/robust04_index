			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Bulletin issued by the Government Secretariat in Mexico </F> City on 2 January; from an XEW "Special Report" -- read by  announcer]    [Text] Today the armed group that had occupied various  municipalities in the region of Ocosingo in Chiapas abandoned  the city of San Cristobal de las Casas. The situation is  returning to normal in that city under the protection of the  Army.    Meanwhile, during its withdrawal, the attacking group has  clashed with soldiers and harassed other towns, causing loss of  human life and diverse damage. As of this afternoon, the  attitude of the federal government and a balance of the events  that have taken place in the first two days of the year in the  Ocosingo region, Chiapas, can be summarized as follows:    On 1 January the federal government decided to place  priority  on the protection of human lives. That is why the Army did not  act when the attacking armed group occupied the city of San  Cristobal de las Casas. Not only did the security forces  refrain from acting, but the government made numerous calls for  dialogue and a search for peaceful solutions to the situation  created by the armed group.    Both the federal government and Chiapas regional and  municipal authorities have reiterated their willingness to hold  a political dialogue with all organizations and representations  of civilian society to normalize the situation in the region.    During the second day of disturbances today, after the  attackers left San Cristobal de las Casas, the federal  government ordered, on the one hand, that the National Defense  Secretariat take measures to defend its installations, and on  the other hand, at the request of social groups of the different  municipalities of the region and municipal and state  authorities, that the National Defense Secretariat itself  reinforce protection and security of towns in the area to  prevent possible new attacks by the armed group.    In the takeover of the cities of Ocosingo, Altamirano,  Abasolo, Chanal del Carmen, Las Margaritas, and San Cristobal de  las Casas, the attackers killed 27 people, 24 of whom were local  policemen, and three civilians. Meanwhile, during clashes  between the armed group and the Army, six soldiers and 24  attackers were killed.</p>

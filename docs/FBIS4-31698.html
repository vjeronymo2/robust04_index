			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Regular Tuesday interview with Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus </F> by correspondent David Stahlavsky on 14 June; place not given --  recorded]    [Excerpts] [Stahlavsky] Mr. Prime Minister, in our regular  interviews it has always been me who asked the questions. It  occurred to me that we could perhaps make an exception today so  that you yourself could pick an event or topic of the past days  that you would like to talk about.    [Klaus] You have taken me by surprise. I am really not  prepared for this. I think that the topic that somewhat stirred  up public opinion as well as the political sphere was, of  course, the recalling of Tomas Jezek as the head of the National  Property Fund [NPF] and the appointment of the new candidate to  that post. [passage omitted]    It seems to me that it is a serious matter. As far as I can  see I think the way it was done did not satisfy many -- the  public in particular. I think that this is a pity. Most of  all, it would be a pity to send out to the world any confusing  signals which, in my opinion, are not appropriate.    [Stahlavsky] Mr. Prime Minister, in connection with Tomas  Jezek's departure from the NPF, Jaroslav Ortman, a  representative of the left bloc, said that this is the beginning  of a search for the one who is guilty of errors made during  privatization.    [Klaus] No, that is certainly not the case. I believe that  with Ortman it is a case of wishful thinking. It really is not  the case. The problem is on one side a standard problem, that  is a political struggle of one against another. [passage  omitted]    [Stahlavsky] [passage omitted] What is your opinion on the  strengthening of presidential office powers?    [Klaus] None of us has discussed the strengthening or non-  strengthening of the presidential office. Similarly, none of us  has dealt with eliminating the Senate from the Constitution. We  are permanently being attributed ideas like that and I repeat  that we are not dealing with such issues. [passage omitted]</p>

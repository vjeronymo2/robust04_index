			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From "The Voz Andes" newscast] </F>   [Text] Quito -- The Ecuadoran Government has rejected the  label of unrealistic that European Union [EU] authorities have  used for a proposal that was presented by five Latin American  countries to increase their banana export quotas to the European  market.    Representatives of the Ecuadoran, Guatemalan, Honduran,  Panamanian, and Mexican governments a few days ago presented to  Rene Speicken, European agriculture commissioner, a Latin  American proposal to abolish the current license system and  establish a higher tariff without allocation to countries for  non-EU suppliers. [sentence as heard]    The European Union had labeled as unrealistic the new  proposal presented by several Latin American countries on the  system to export bananas to the EU market. Jose Vicente  Maldonado, Ecuadoran industries and commerce minister, has said  labeling the proposal as unrealistic is equivalent to labeling  as unrealistic the commercial opening and economic globalization  processes that have originated in the European Community.    The European Union today announced the withdrawal of its  most  recent proposal on banana imports due to the five Latin American  countries that had filed a lawsuit at GATT; only Colombia and  Costa Rica had accepted the proposal.    According to a report from Santa Fe de Bogota, the Colombian  banana industry on Friday considered the possibility of joining  forces with Guatemala to file a third recourse at GATT against  the EU's banana-importing system. Juan Diego Velez, president  of the Association of Uraba Banana Producers, has said this  possibility will have to be studied, because the Colombian  banana market's situation is unfavorable. According to Velez,  Colombian banana producers have already lost approximately $32  million since the EU changed the terms for importing bananas.</p>

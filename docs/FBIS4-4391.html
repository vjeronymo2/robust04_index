			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 31 KYODO -- Bangladesh Prime Minister  Begum Khaleda Ziaur on Thursday [31 March] reiterated her  country's support for Japan's "legitimate aspirations" for a  permanent seat on the U.N. Security Council [UNSC]. Ziaur,  speaking to reporters at the Japan National Press Club, said  Japan deserves "a more effective institutional role" in the U.N.  system in general and in the Security Council in particular by  virtue of its status as an Asian "economic superpower."    The 48-year-old premier, one of only three women now serving  as head of an Islamic country, said Bangladesh's support stems  from its belief "that the leadership and positive posture of  Japan are important for further strengthening the role of Asia  in international relations."    Ziaur earlier made a considerably stronger declaration of  support at a dinner banquet hosted by Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa on Tuesday, in which she told her host country, "We are  totally behind you in your effort to be a permanent member of  the Security Council."    In summit talks with Hosokawa on Tuesday, she was quoted as  offering to drum up support for Japan's bid among other  countries with which Bangladesh maintains close relations.    Ziaur told reporters that ties between Bangladesh and Japan  are "excellent." Expressing appreciation for Japanese  assistance, she noted that it has so far been aimed at  supporting democratic progress, economic reforms and social  development. In an implicit request for continued aid,  especially grants, she added, "We expect continued Japanese  support for social sectors such as primary and mass education,  primary health care, poverty alleviation and environmental  development."    Ziaur, who arrived in Tokyo on Monday for an official visit,  is scheduled to return home via Osaka on Friday.</p>

			<p><P> January 25, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FAX FEVER;  </P> <P> FROM BUSINESS TOOL TO HOMEWORK AID TO MONKEY BUSINESS, THE MACHINE'S TAKEN OVER  </P> <P> Why are all those Beverly Hills home fax machines purring away late at night?  Stockbrokers passing hot tips on to blue-chip customers? Movie execs swapping  script outlines into the night? Foodies sending finicky take-out orders to  their favorite delis?  </P> <P> Would you believe homework?  </P> <P> According to fax machine providers, Westsiders who own the devices and have  teen-agers (who understandably wish to remain anonymous) are likely to have  their machines tied up at night with school assignments being faxed back and  forth.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Parental Approval  </P> <P> And even those kids who do their homework unassisted are eager to use faxes to  create electronic study groups -- with parental approval. "My daughter is just  waiting for somebody in her class to have a parent bring a fax machine home,"  said Bill McCue, president of Public FAX in Orange. "They always forget stuff .  . . she'll call up a girlfriend and try to figure out how to do math problems.  You ever try to do math over the phone?"  </P> <P> It's all part of the growing fax consciousness. Initially introduced as a  business tool, facsimile machines -- which send and receive documents over  telephone lines in seconds -- are suddenly being employed for an expanding  array of personal uses: everything from playing chess to executing practical  jokes to sending holiday greetings to locating missing children.  </P> <P> Not only has the abbreviation fax made it into Webster's, the number of fax  machines in the country has grown to 1.7 million, according to estimates of  analysts at San Jose's Dataquest, a high-tech market research and consulting  firm. As most of those machines are still in offices, business applications are  also expanding rapidly and becoming far more creative.  </P> <P> Doctors now routinely fax prescriptions to pharmacies. Fire department  personnel fax blueprints of buildings to fire fighters at fire sites. And  high-tech bill collectors now have a lightning-quick retort for deadbeats who  claim they lost or didn't receive an invoice in the mail: They fax a new one  immediately and it gets there in less than a minute.  </P> <P> Some observers claim the most innovative business application to date is  intra-office faxing. "What we're starting to see at a lot of companies is  people faxing one desk to another," said Ray Jeter of Just the Fax, an  Irvine-based chain of fax retailers.  </P> <P> At AST Research, also in Irvine, employees frequently fax documents to each  other rather than using messengers to deliver them. "We have regular mail  clerks, but facsimile is so much faster," enthused Ron Place, office services  supervisor. "We're spread out across two or three buildings . . . altogether in  excess of half a million square feet . . . I don't know how we lived without  (fax machines) before."  </P> <P> Fax has also enlivened the formats of radio stations eager to court those who  listen at the office (especially since the Arbitron ratings were recently  expanded to monitor office listening habits). Numerous stations have invited  audiences to communicate with deejays via office fax machines. Some, such as  WMMR in Philadelphia, have even asked listeners to "fax us your body parts."  </P> <P> That sport showed up recently on the sitcom "Murphy Brown," when the TV  reporter played by Candice Bergen explained her absence from the office  Christmas party, saying, "The memory of last year's party is still fresh in my  mind. Perhaps you heard about it. I drank all the punch and faxed my chest to  the West Coast."  </P> <P> On KABC's "Ken &amp; Bob Co.," a high-rated, morning drive-time show, listeners  have been instructed to fax in such things as stupid instructions that  accompany products. The fax format became so popular the duo formed a special  club for waxing silly with office listeners via fax.  </P> <P> But is this what the fax revolution has come to? Charter membership in Ken and  Bob's "Nine O'Clock Fax Club"?  </P> <P> "You don't buy a fax machine to phone in trivia to a radio station or to order  a ham and rye at a deli," contended McCue, who, as an industry consultant and  publisher of a directory of 5,000 public fax stations, is sometimes called the  "guru of fax."  </P> <P> "You buy it for a business use, then that expands. People who buy fax machines  become enlightened -- and addicted. They start using it in ways they never  imagined."  </P> <P> Indeed, faxaholics are multiplying at such a frenetic rate that some experts  predict the medium is likely to beat out the computer as the next major  contraption to link up the entire world.  </P> <P> Stephan Schwartz, chairman and research director of the Los Angeles-based  Mobius Society, has sent fax communication "all over the world" since the  1970s, when the medium was slow and commercially known by the name Qwip.  Lately, Schwartz said he's been sending faxes between the United States and the  Soviet Union to speed up a number of citizen diplomacy projects in which he's  involved.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Even Into Soviet Union  </P> <P> "There aren't many fax machines yet in the Soviet Union but I think the Soviets  are going to embrace the technology with great gusto. . . . We've sent  pictures, maps, charts, spread sheets . . . letters," said Schwartz, whose  organization is best known for such projects as psychic-assisted archeological  digs. "You can send anything you can photocopy. The fax is like a little space  bridge."  </P> <P> Not only do fax machines transmit drawings and photographs (minus a few half  tones), they're notoriously easy to operate. (Basically, you insert a piece of  paper and punch in a phone number.) What's more, prices have come down; you can  now purchase a fax machine for as little as $600, up to $2,500.  </P> <P> They're hot, convenient, easy to use and increasingly affordable. Is it any  wonder that fax machines are now affecting people's lives from the cradle to  the grave?  </P> <P> McCue observes that a Klamath Falls, Ore., public fax outlet "does a husky  business with local morticians with a  </P> <P> need to get interment papers signed rapidly." And on New Year's Day, one of his  Public FAX employees gave birth to a baby at 1:30 p.m. After the baby's  footprints were recorded, they were faxed to Carbondale, Ill., to the baby's  great-grandparents, who received the prints within an hour of the birth.  </P> <P> Judi Kaufman, who sometimes advises corporate clients on "fax etiquette" as a  part of the services of her gift-buying firm, would no doubt approve.  </P> <P> Kaufman, however, generally cautions against sending faxed greetings and  thank-you notes -- unless the spontaneity of the medium is warranted by the  circumstances.  </P> <P> "The only way faxed thank-you notes are effective is if they're sent back  immediately after receiving a gift delivered by courier," said the owner of  Beverly Hills-based Judi Kaufman &amp; Co. "It has to work with the nature of  the gift."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Care Advised  </P> <P> Kaufman also advises users to be careful when punching in fax numbers.  </P> <P> "I got an entire musical score faxed in from New York by mistake," said Maxine  Weinman, owner of Maxine's Seafood Cafe in Hollywood, where about 20% to 30% of  take-out orders come through her "Fax It to Max" service.  </P> <P> More than a few of Max's faxes look like mistakes but prove to be orders,  Weinman added. One order came completely in drawings: a fish and a sword for  swordfish, a fish in a cage for Cajun fish. Another order (featuring a drawing  of a large apple, a piece of cheese and a piece of cake) momentarily stumped  the restaurant crew. "We finally figured out it was for New York cheese cake,"  Weinman said.  </P> <P> Weinman reports she enjoys the communications from her creative faxers and  doesn't mind the inconvenience of an occasional mix-up, because her take-out  orders are processed more accurately and efficiently than they would be if  taken by phone.  </P> <P> But Kaufman warns that wrong numbers on fax deliveries could result in "state  of the art faux pas."  </P> <P> </P> <P> IRS Tax Notices Sent  </P> <P> Consider the temporary terror a local shopkeeper experienced when an IRS audit  form crossed her fax machine and she assumed it was meant for her. (She later  discovered her husband had told a client to send him a copy of the form on his  wife's fax machine but neglected to tell her it was coming.)  </P> <P> "Twice this week, people have faxed me confidential information that was  intended for somebody else," Kaufman said. Another phenomenon she sees more and  more is the snobbery of fax-haves vs. fax-nots.  </P> <P> "Especially in Los Angeles, there's a group who thinks that if you don't have a  fax you're out of the loop of business," she observed. "For small,  entrepreneurial companies in a tight financial market, it's a difficult issue  to handle."  </P> <P> Public FAX's McCue points out, however, that "the poor man's fax is a $10  decision to use a public fax station. When people say to (a faxless person),  'What's your fax number?', the person . . . can give the fax number of a public  station. And no one's the wiser."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Solved His Embarrassment  </P> <P> Jack Nilles, senior research associate at the USC School of Business  Administration's Center for Effective Organizations, recently solved his  embarrassment over faxlessness by getting a machine. "I was getting several  calls a week where people would say, 'I'll fax you this.' Fortunately they  couldn't see my face turn red over the phone," Nilles said.  </P> <P> Nilles is one who suspects fax communication will beat out computer networking  among offices and individuals who've absolutely, positively got to have it  there faster than overnight.  </P> <P> "I've been watching this for the last 10 years, to see if electronic (computer)  mail or fax machines are going to win," he said. "In the interim, it looks like  fax will beat out electronic mail."  </P> <P> Dataquest's Greg Carlsted agrees. "The growth of facsimile is superior to  E-mail (electronic computer mail) at this point," he said. In Carlsted's  opinion, that's because people have become more and more aware of faxing,  prices of the machines have decreased and standardization is allowing different  types of machines to talk with one another.  </P> <P> Carnegie Mellon University's Sara Kiesler, who for seven years has researched  the social effects of electronic mail and other electronic exchanges of  information, expects a swift merger between electronic mail and fax.  </P> <P> "I think they will be so integrated in the near future that you won't be able  to distinguish one from the other," said Kiesler, who is a professor of social  sciences and social psychology. "(Asking which medium will dominate) is almost  like saying 'Will television beat movies?' We have VCRs now. How can you  distinguish?"  </P> <P> </P> <P> Which Are Fakes?  </P> <P> Meanwhile, with the growth in faxed communications, it's becoming increasingly  tough to distinguish between genuine documents and fakes.  </P> <P> Rand Corp. researcher Tora Bikson, a consultant to a United Nations task force  studying electronic transferal of information, points out that the dramatic  increase in fax use is raising all sorts of questions for organizations. Among  those being studied at the U.N.: "How do organizations . . . control or  document the use of fax? How do they distinguish between what's official  communication and what's not?"  </P> <P> As practical jokers have found, less-than-perfect fax reproduction of documents  makes the medium appealing for forgeries of all kinds. An Indianapolis car  salesman tells of what happened when he accidentally left a set of family  photos behind at one car dealership before moving on to another. One of his  former colleagues cut the photos apart so that the salesman's head was atop the  body of his young son, sitting nude in a bathtub.  </P> <P> "It was my second day on the new job when the picture came over the fax," Rick  Moonshower recalled. "All of a sudden the women upstairs came down the stairs  laughing. The photo had a note saying, 'Ladies, I'd like you to meet your new  employee.' "  </P> <P> </P> <P> Personal Notes  </P> <P> Other personal missives are not so much obscene as they are simply annoying. At  Berkeley-based Ten Speed Press and Celestial Art publishing houses, publicity  director Dayna Macy bemoans the fact that the organization receives daily faxes  from "a set of authors who shall remain nameless."  </P> <P> "We get seven-page faxes from them, 10-page faxes; they faxed their Christmas  card to us. We pay for all this paper," Macy said.  </P> <P> "This stuff makes people feel efficient, like they're doing something. And you  can't hide from it anymore. They've got you by phone, by Federal Express and  the last bastion -- they've got you by fax," she sighed. "You can't even hide  under your desk anymore. There's a fax on top of it."  </P></p>

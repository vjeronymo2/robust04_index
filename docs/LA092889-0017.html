			<p><P> September 28, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ONCE THE BOSSES LOVED THE PRESS;  </P> <P> SOVIETS OUTGROWING PRECOOKED NEWS  </P> <P> Today we are moving away from the trance into which Soviet society once lapsed  -- either on orders or from sheer fright -- to a concrete assessment of all  that has happened to us.  </P> <P> We are reading our press with unprecedented attention, we are peering intently  into the TV screens. We are rethinking ourselves and our place in life.  </P> <P> Transforming society and telling the truth are daunting propositions in this  country, where we still have laws -- never formally renounced -- that could  land half, if not all, of the most fervent glasnost supporters in jail.  </P> <P> Confusion reigns in the house under reconstruction. Apart from looking for new  paths to the future, we are also thinking over the plans for today's salvation.  And we want to understand our past -- although this is no easy task, because  many crucial documents are still out of circulation.  </P> <P> The Soviet press symbolizes the biggest achievement of perestroika. For the  first time, the press represents a threat to those who would like to arrest the  positive changes in the Soviet Union. That is why it lives amid constant  attempts to slow it down, to apply the brakes.  </P> <P> The relationship between events and the reporting of events is traditionally  complicated. In the absence of even a hint of a law on the mass media (although  the Soviet legislature is working on one), too much depends on the boss and his  whim.  </P> <P> There were times when the bosses loved us! This love reached its peak 10 or 15  years ago, when the press was swimming in a torrent of sunny news. The Soviet  people read the papers meditatively while standing in endless lines, and at  best their attitude toward the press was that of compassion. But the bosses  loved us!  </P> <P> It was then that one of the most ridiculously showcased publications, Ogonyok,  received the country's highest decoration, the Lenin Order. The magazine was  horrible, but eminently tame, which was the reason it received the order.  Ogonyok's tales of prosperity flowed merrily on; to express doubts of the  actual existence of prosperity was not only unpatriotic but also subject to  legal action.  </P> <P> Repression is not the only weapon against the media. They can also be pampered  and domesticated.  </P> <P> It seems that Soviet society has a stable, unchanging allotment of optimism.  Sometimes the bulk of optimism is in the upper levels of power, and sometimes  it flows downward, to the people, leaving the leaders in a state of deep worry.  </P> <P> In this country, the population has never rejoiced as a whole. In the years of  terror, Josef Stalin and his team beamed from countless posters and official  photographs. Today, as we move tortuously toward democracy and renovation, the  bureaucracy demonstrates profound pessimism or even outrage. The picture of a  beaming leader today is a rarity.  </P> <P> The bureaucrats had been building the country for themselves. Now they are  doomed to fight to the death. They have no choice.  </P> <P> But this is also true of the rest of the country. Having started to think and  analyze, the people cannot stop, no matter who tells them to do so.  </P> <P> With this new habit of thinking, we are making discoveries that add little to  our feeling of comfort. For instance, we have discovered that there are a great  many dishonest people among our leaders. The main criterion for selection to  the top jobs in this country was always the ability to obey, rather than brains  or original ideas. Unquestioned loyalty to ideological dogmas was always worth  more than professionalism. Because loyalty is much easier to simulate than  competence and knowledge, the share of cynical and dishonest functionaries  steadily grew in our leadership.  </P> <P> That was true everywhere. When I entered the editorial office of Ogonyok for  the first time, I discovered a long list of names under the glass on the desk.  This proved to be the complete list of birthdays of all the Politburo members  and the Central Committee secretaries. Next to each name, careful notes were  made: whose portrait was to be published in color and whose in mere black and  white on the required day.  </P> <P> I asked if a special Central Committee decree had been adopted on the subject,  or perhaps it was simply the initiative of my overzealous predecessor. "There  was no special decision," was the answer, "but no one has ever objected."  </P> <P> Is it necessary to mention that my predecessor, who successfully killed the old  Ogonyok, was pensioned off with the title of the Hero of Socialist Labor?  </P> <P> Even in this time of change, the official "fighting unit" functions as before.  I refer to the Communist Party's daily Pravda, as well as subservient  television and radio.  </P> <P> People in this country had long been accustomed to a precooked dish of news,  instead of separate components with which everyone makes his own meal. The  country lived on a diet of commentary rather than reporting. But a new  generation of readers is emerging along with a new generation of reporters.  </P> <P> The bureaucrats open their mailboxes with trepidation every morning. This not  so much because some unexpected article or a block-busting interview might  appear. The problem is that social control is slipping from their grip.  </P> <P> A process of serious, dignified thinking is going on in the country, and this  is reflected in the mass media. The censors remove one, two or more articles,  but this no longer changes the overall situation. With the absence of a press  law, the relationships between the editor and the censor are full of mystery  and half-legal actions, relying for the most part on the temperaments of both.  </P> <P> Freedom of expression is a complicated phenomenon in a country unable to feed  its population and apprehensive of awakening thought. We are trying to steer  the middle course between China and Poland. The Communist Party does not intend  to lose its monopoly on power as in Poland, but neither does it plan to support  its authority with tanks as it did in China. This makes the press the crucially  important instrument.  </P> <P> We are building the country. We are trying to create a new society, where  time-honored traditions and institutions will be given new places and  functions.  </P> <P> I am editing a magazine that fights for this goal, for the new society and for  the new place in it for ourselves. "Please, don't be afraid," the readers are  encouraging us. "Write the truth!" This is a completely new situation in the  Soviet press: We now depend on people who are craving the truth. Let it be  forever!  </P></p>

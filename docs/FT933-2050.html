			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / Leading Article: London security THE SECURITY cordon thrown round a small area of London's financial district to deter terrorist attacks appears to have achieved a degree of success. It has been breached only once since the traffic restrictions were introduced in July - and then by a small device which was safely defused. The predicted traffic jams have not materialised. Walking through the less congested City streets has become more pleasant. Crime has fallen and there has been no armed robbery within the secure area. The measures have been popular with businesses inside the cordon. The City Corporation, the local authority for the area, has found overwhelming support for making the traffic restrictions permanent. The Corporation believes it has reassured many international businesses which might find terrorist attacks sufficient reason to relocate to other European cities. Yet the government is rightly unwilling to commit itself to making the restrictions a permanent feature. Most businesses in London - including many from overseas - remain outside the security cordon. Welcome though the environmental benefits are, they are poor justification for a scheme that may in the end simply displace the bombers' attention to other parts of the capital. More durable may be the approach adopted in other parts of London, particularly around the government buildings in Whitehall. There, security has been improved by heightened surveillance and parking restrictions. Similar measures have also been introduced in the City at the same time as the traffic restrictions, and would continue were the traffic restrictions to be discontinued. More, too, could be done to use the security systems of London's businesses to reinforce the efforts of the police and security services. Video cameras on business premises can deter terrorist attacks and help in finding those who perpetrate them. Yet senior police officers say that they are often not adequately maintained. Businesses could also do more to coordinate their security measures with their neighbours to ensure comprehensive coverage. Adjustments to the arrangements for providing insurance cover for terrorist damage could play a part in heightening business awareness. Since the commercial insurers withdrew from the market, the government has helped create an insurance pool to which it acts as insurer of last resort. However, the premium structure offers no incentives for businesses that take precautions against terrorist attacks. Premium discounts for businesses that adopt approved security measures would be a further step in the fight against terrorism.</p>

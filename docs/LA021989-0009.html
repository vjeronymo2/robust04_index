			<p><P> February 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: PALACE POTATO  </P> <P> The upscale Videotheque stores in West Hollywood and Bev Hills get their share  of free-spending video customers, from busloads of Japanese tourists to  big-name Hollywood types. But none tops a 30-year-old Saudi Arabian prince from  Riyadh, who recently faxed a routine order for 300 movies. Total cost, at  $89.95 each: $27,000 (yes, we saw the invoice).  </P> <P> "He likes anything in color, but tends to stay away from gory films," said  Videotheque exec assistant Ria Snoek, who asked us not to name the prince. "No  musicals, no subtitles, and nothing in black and white. And, of course, no  pornography."  </P> <P> Owner Meir Hed said he counts several Saudi royal personages among his regular  customers, but this particular prince is the biggest spender: more than  $600,000 on videotapes since 1981.

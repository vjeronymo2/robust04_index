			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / Norwegian parties put their faith in higher taxes: Unemployment is key election issue MR Thorbjoern Jagland, leader of Norway's Labour party although not its prime ministerial candidate, was adamant in the final televised debate before Monday's general election that higher taxes and more public jobs were the way to solve the country's persistent unemployment problem. 'We will have to accept that higher taxes will be necessary to create more jobs and that we will use the public sector as a motor to create new jobs,' he said in a debate between candidates from eight parties. The ruling Labour party clings to socialist orthodoxies long after most of Europe's social democratic parties have adopted market policies to shore up diminishing support. But in Norway, where oil wealth has helped cushion the economic shocks which have hit the continent in recent years, the European trend to cut government spending as the way to attack unemployment is little in evidence. Labour looks set to return to power in Monday's vote, according to polls. Aside from the question of Norway's membership in the EC, how to deal with post-war record unemployment of 8.2 per cent has been the dominant issue in an otherwise lacklustre campaign. In Thursday night's debate, held in the lakeside town of Gjoevik, the main opposition Conservative party's spokesman on the economy, Mr Per-Kristian Foss, was a minority voice when he said Norway should be dismantling its high tax regime and big public sector if the country wanted to create jobs. 'Every time Labour has promised lower unemployment in an election campaign, it has gone up,' Mr Foss said. However, even the right-wing Progress party, which was founded on a tax-cutting platform, seems to have abandoned this ideal in the face of public demand for immediate solutions to the unemployment problem. Most of the attacks on Labour during the debate came from the Centre party, the Socialist Left party and the neo-Maoist Red Choice Alliance which, to varying degrees, argued for more state involvement in the fight against joblessness, despite annual government spending of NKr20bn (Pounds 1.87bn) on training schemes. The representatives of the three parties also called for a special tax on overtime, which Labour has rejected. They claim more that 130,000 Norwegians have more than one job, and by taxing overtime some 108,000 jobs could be immediately created. Nor did the Christian People's party, just four years ago a Conservative coalition partner, offer much support to Mr Foss. Instead, Mr Jon Lilletun, its representative, called for the pension age to be lowered to 64 from 67 to create 30,000 new jobs. A right turn in economic policy therefore seems unlikely after Monday's vote. With Labour consistently leading in the polls, but with no prospect of winning an overall majority, the expectation is it will form a government relying principally on the backing of the Socialist Left and Centre parties. This will mean a delicate balancing act for Mrs Gro Harlem Brundtland, Labour's figurehead and trump card as an experienced and respected prime minister. Assuming she returns to power, she will have to maintain the partners' support, despite their vehement opposition to Labour's application for Norwegian membership of the EC. In what promises to be a complex pattern of party alliances, Labour will look to the Conservatives, the second largest party, for backing on the EC issue. The Conservatives would like to form another coalition, as they did after the last election, in 1989. But that is unlikely because of the lack of pro-European partners. The previous coalition with the Christian People's party and the Centre party fell apart after a year over the junior partners' opposition to EC membership.</p>

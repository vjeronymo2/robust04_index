			<p><P> May 19, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UAW FILES PETITION FOR ELECTION AT NISSAN'S PLANT IN TENNESEE  </P> <P> After 16 months of organizing, the United Auto Workers union filed a petition  Thursday calling for an election at the Nissan automobile and truck plant here.  </P> <P> The filing with the National Labor Relations Board sets up a showdown between  organized labor and the second-largest Japanese automobile plant in the nation.  </P> <P> Eleven union leaders and workers led by Jim Weaver, who has coordinated the  drive since January, took a box of cards signed by Nissan employees to the NLRB  office in Nashville Thursday morning.  </P> <P> Buddy Shonting, a technician in the trim and chassis plant, said, "I think  we're going to whip the britches off of them."  </P> <P> Union officials had wanted to time the filing so that the election would occur  on a favorable day for them either before or after the plant takes its regular  annual production break July 3-17.  </P> <P> Company officials have said that it would probably take about 60 days after a  petition is filed for the NLRB to hold an election.  </P> <P> Gail Neuman, vice president of human resources for the company, welcomed a  conclusion to months of organizing that often left employees bitterly divided.  </P> <P> "We are confident that the great majority of Nissan employees will vote against  the union," she said.  </P></p>

			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / Yorks businesses see signs of recovery BUSINESS in the Yorkshire area and Humberside is beginning to show signs of recovery but prospects are still fragile, the region's Confederation of British Industry council said yesterday. There have been signs of further improvement since the regional trends survey was compiled. Mr Peter Barker, chairman of the regional council, said the most recent evidence was of domestic orders increasing for some companies and being at least stable for the majority. 'If the indicators on output and orders strengthen over the coming months - and if businesses maintain the pressure on costs which now appears to be bearing fruit - we should be able to discern a turning point and the beginning of the recovery,' Mr Barker added. He said the process would be slow, with definite signs elusive for some time. Confidence was crucial, but the general election had strengthened it. CBI members do not, however, expect employment prospects to improve. The region is likely to have Britain's smallest year-on-year decline by the end of June, but that will still be 2.8 percentage points.</p>

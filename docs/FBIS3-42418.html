Mayatskiy: "Military Chemistry: The </F> Reality and the Future (Report on Special Operational  Assembly)"]    [Text] In accordance with the operational and combat  training plan for the Ground Troops a special operational  assembly was held for supervisory personnel of the CBR troops  and military educational institutions at the Scientific Research  and Testing Institute in Shikhany from 14 to 17 June of this  year. This year it dealt mainly with development of the  Radiation, Chemical and Biological Service and troops of the  Russian armed forces: The concept for their development, their  missions in peace time and time of war, their combat training,  their equipment and so forth.    According to plan, the first two days were designated for a  scientific military conference on "Problems of Radiation,  Chemical and Biological Protection, and its Technical Support."  Colonel-General S. Petrov, chief of CBR Troops, delivered the  introduction and a report. Describing the difficulty of the  transitional period and its influence upon the shaping of a new  Russian army, he noted that in addition to all else, somewhat  different factors are still the determining ones for the CBR  service and troops.    On the one hand, despite the signing of a number of  significant international agreements pertaining to weapons of  mass destruction, they continue to pose a potential threat to  military personnel and the civilian population in case of an  armed conflict involving their employment. Furthermore, there is  already information on modern scientific research which does not  fall within the framework of existing types of OMP [weapons of  mass destruction]. These are primarily binary systems with other  than traditional action, chemicals which, although not covered  by the Convention Banning the Development, Production and  Employment of Chemical Weapons, and on Their Destruction, put  military equipment and the like out of action.    On the other hand, there is a growing likelihood of  accidents  involving highly active toxic and radioactive substances.  Incidents of recent years at industrial enterprises and in  transport have convincingly demonstrated that the technogenic  aspect poses no less a danger than the effects of nuclear and  chemical attacks.    There is yet a third circumstance of considerable  importance.  While the two superpowers, the USSR and the USA, were previously  drawn into the arms race, a totally opposite process has now  begun. Chemical disarmament, that is, the salvaging of our  stockpiles of toxic substances which were to have been delivered  to the CBR troops, will cost Russia 1.5 trillion dollars at  current prices.    The requirements of the CBR troops were then defined. First  of all, they have a dual purpose enabling them to carry out  missions equally effectively in peace time and in time of war.  Their weapons and technical equipment must be all-purpose and  highly productive. In the future the T/O of the units and  subunits will be determined precisely by the capabilities of the  equipment. The command and control system for the CBR troops  will also undergo considerable change, since one is  inconceivable at the present stage without being integrated into  the overall system of command and control of the forces our  specialists are supporting. Finally, the CBR troops cannot  survive without the development of their own infrastructure.    Many generals and other officers presented co-reports. The  most diverse issues were raised. I shall mention a few of them:  The participation of CBR troops in the destruction of chemical  weapons and the cleansing of the environment, the specific  features of the emotional and psychological conditioning of the  personnel in the contemporary situation, improvement of the  training system, including the training of officers, in view of  the low manning level of the units and subunits and the  transition to contract service, and so forth.    A discussion of radiation, chemical and bacteriological  protection in a battle and an operation evoked the greatest  interest. Unlike chemical support, its organization and  implementation will be directed toward reducing losses to a  minimum and ensuring the execution of the missions assigned to  them in a situation of CBR contamination, as well as  counteracting high-precision weapons, weapons laying and  reconnaissance facilities. It was suggested that the place and  role in the overall system of troop protection and the new type  of combat missions be viewed from the standpoint of the  combined-arms commander and not the Chief of the CBR service.    During the following two days the assembly participants, as  well as Colonel-General A. Sergeyev, commander of the PriVO  [Volga Military District], Lieutenant-General G. Shpak, district  chief of staff, and Saratov Oblast leaders attended practical  exercises. They were first shown an exhibit of Russian line gas  weapons and ammunition developed for them by associates at the  NIII [Scientific Research and Testing Institute]. They then  inspected prospective models of CBR weapons and protective gear.  A special protective suit with a ventilated space beneath the  surface, all-purpose, on-board BKSO [on-board special  decontamination systems] designed for use with water or  solvents, and much more were demonstrated at special sites.    Deserving of attention in the area of line gear for  measuring  ionizing radiation were new instruments for measuring dose  strength: The IMD-2 with an operating range of 10-5 to 103  roentgens/hour, which can be fixed, on-board or portable; the  IMD-5, which can register both gamma (within a range of 6 to  200,000 millirads/hour) and beta radiation (50-5,000  decays/minute cm2); the IMD-22, designed for measuring the  radiation level in an area (10-104 rads/hour), as well the total  permissible dose of pulsed gamma-neutron and continuous-wave  gamma radiation (50-2,000 rads).    With respect to the other types of CBR weapons and  protection, many of them were also demonstrated in action after  they were inspected. This was due to the fact that in view of  the significant reduction in the number of exercises and drills  in recent years, many combined-arms officers, particularly the  specialists, have lost their skills in organizing and carrying  out CBR measures. Among other things, they have almost forgotten  the methods of employing incendiary weapons and aerosols, at a  time when the importance of these in unit and subunit combat is  continuously increasingly today.    According to the international classification incendiary  weapons are listed as conventional weapons. Their indisputable  advantage, however, a fact demonstrated in the Great Patriotic  and Afghan wars, lies in their powerful emotional and  psychological effect upon personnel. The flamethrower units and  subunits, the artillery and the aviation presently have  incendiary ammunition.    A practical exercise in a tactical setting was organized and  conducted by Col I. Mukhin, chief for Combat Training of the  Directorate of the Chief of CBR Troops. The flamethrower  operators were the first to demonstrate their skills. With a  squad salvo they destroyed an infantry group with armored  equipment. They fired the rocket-propelled infantry flamethrower  with different filling: a thermobaric compound and an incendiary  mixture.    An experimental model of a combat vehicle for flamethrower  operators was also demonstrated. Theoretically, it enhances  their effectiveness when operating together with motorized-rifle  subunits in close combat. Institute associates have mounted a  compact, 12-barrel, bank-type unit on a tracked armor chassis,  which can fire the RPO-A organic flamethrower in single-fire or  automatic mode at a range of 700 meters. The vehicle was  designed for a squad. It will also carry spare rounds and  support the flamethrowers with organic guns and machine guns.    A one-shot, jet flamethrower is unique and promising. It is  made in a standard RPO-A container and is loaded with a  condensed liquid incendiary compound and designed for destroying  targets at a range of up to 70 meters in street battles, in  structures, tunnels and so forth.    The aviation then took over. Two Su-24s dropped ZB-500Sh  incendiary tanks on a motor-vehicle column, each containing 250  kilograms of incendiary mixture. The effect was impressive. The  next pairs used aerosol counteraction substances. DAB-100-90fm  smoke bombs blinded the "enemy" in his positions for a long  time. An AAP-500 airborne aerosol device was used from an  altitude of 100 meters to cover the fly-through route of a  tactical airborne landing force with a vertical screen.    The most difficult and extensive aerosol camouflage missions  will still be performed by the CBR troops, however. The  technical equipment for this is presently being modernized, and  new models are being developed. This primarily involves on-board  aerosol generators for spray trucks. The ARS-14 equipped with  them is capable of generating smoke continuously for five hours,  creating a 600-meter aerosol cloud with improved parameters.    Improved operating modes were presented for the organic  smoke  machines (TMS-65D, TDA-2M, TDA-2K): pulsating or combination and  directing certain free-flowing materials into a high-speed  stream of dispersed aerosol-generating elements. They not only  do not reduce the space-and-time features of the screen but are  markedly more effective than existing ones -- in their  consumption of smoke mixture, their covering of the infrared  band, and so forth. Ultimately all of this will enhance the  capabilities of the CBR troops for aerosol counteraction by a  factor of 2-3.    The assembly concluded with a class on the subject "Mopping  up Following an Accident in Transporting SDYaV [Highly Active  Toxic Substances]." It was also organized and conducted by  combat training officers of the Directorate of the Chief of CBR  Troops. Personnel of the unit commanded by Lt-Col S. Safoshkin  took part. It was held at a training field specially outfitted  with a rail bed and tank cars.    The advance group was the first to reach the accident site.  CW reconnaissance scouts ascertained the situation at the  center, marked a contamination zone around the perimeter and  designated the entry route. The column of Capt A. Kartashov's  composite subunit soon came up. They began emergency work  following brief reconnaissance. They covered the mirror of  spilled SDYaV with foam and then began diluting it. The mixture  was trapped, neutralized and removed to a safekeeping site.    The exercise was instructive. Most importantly, however, it  made it possible to demonstrate for the assembly participants  the sequence and the process of all the operations involved in  the system for mopping up after an accident involving highly  active toxic substances at civilian facilities.    In his summation Colonel-General S. Petrov, chief of the CBR  troops, gave a good rating to the performance of all the  personnel who helped set up and conduct the assembly. Many of  them were singled out for valuable awards and monetary prizes.    COPYRIGHT: VOYENNYY VESTNIK No 11 1993</p>

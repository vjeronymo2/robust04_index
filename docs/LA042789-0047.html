			<p><P> April 27, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOUR WHEELS: CLEARING AIR ON CATALYTIC CONVERTERS  </P> <P> Question: My car, a 1977 station wagon with a catalytic converter, now has more  than 100,000 miles on it. Is the catalytic converter still doing what it is  supposed to do? How much longer will it function well? What effect does the  malfunctioning of a converter have on an engine? And what does all this have to  do with air quality? -- A.K.E.  </P> <P> Answer: Until very recently, little was known publicly about how well emission  systems hold up in cars as they age and accumulate miles. Under federal  regulations, emissions systems in cars are supposed to continue to do their job  for at least 5 years or 50,000 miles, and auto makers must warrant the key  parts of the car that control emissions, including the catalytic converter.  </P> <P> A recent study of emissions conducted by the Auto Club of Southern California  had both encouraging and discouraging findings. The cars involved in the study  were limited to those that had proper maintenance and computerized engine  controls, meaning the cars are among the cleanest-running on the road.  </P> <P> What the Auto Club found was that fewer than 10% of the vehicles tested met the  statutory (5 years or 50,000 miles) emission standard. On average, the vehicles  exceeded the standard for hydrocarbon emissions by 22% and the standard for  oxides of nitrogen by 34%.  </P> <P> The good news was that by 50,000 miles, the deterioration of the emission  control systems stabilizes and the engines don't continue to get worse. In the  category of hydrocarbons, for example, the deterioration in the emission  control system virtually stopped after 60,000 miles. In carbon dioxide, it  virtually stopped after 45,000 miles. And in oxides of nitrogen, it stopped  after about 40,000 miles.  </P> <P> Incidentally, the cars that failed to meet emission standards came from  virtually all manufacturers, domestic and foreign. The study looked at 67 cars;  these were owned by club members, two major corporations and rental agencies.  </P> <P> </P> <P> More Serious Problem  </P> <P> Although the test did not include poorly maintained cars, engineering experts  at the club acknowledged that emissions in these cars are a more serious  problem. It is estimated that if all cars on the road in Southern California  met federal standards, hydrocarbon emissions alone would be cut from the 360  tons per day currently spewed into the air, to only 180 tons per day.  </P> <P> "Manufacturers are capable of making clean cars," said Michael R. Appleby, the  Auto Club's manager of automotive engineering. "Now, all they have to do is get  the cars to meet the standards."  </P> <P> As for your catalytic converter, it is probably still doing its job if your car  can pass an emissions test required by the Department of Motor Vehicles. The  converter can hold up quite well if only unleaded fuel has been used in the  engine. But even a single tankfull of leaded gasoline can ruin a converter.  </P> <P> In addition, a converter can be damaged by a misfiring engine, dieseling, hot  flooding and an inoperative choke, among other common problems. If you are the  original owner of your car, then you should have a fair idea of how the engine  has been treated through the years.  </P> <P> The converter uses platinum to stimulate chemical reactions in the exhaust  gases from your engine. The hot gases pass over a large surface area of  platinum, which converts the hazardous gases to relatively benign gases. For  example, poisonous carbon monoxide gases are converted to carbon dioxide by the  addition of oxygen molecules.  </P> <P> It is difficult to say how a malfunctioning converter will affect the  performance of your particular car, because all cars are different. Generally,  however, a converter that no longer is working increases fuel consumption. And  finally, if the converter is no longer doing its job, the effect on the  atmosphere is that your car is contributing more than its fair share of that  360 tons of pollution every day.  </P></p>

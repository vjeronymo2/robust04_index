Following are the key clauses in the agreement:    Basic Principles:    "The leaders of the 12 factions agree that the basic  principles governing implementation of this program should be  based on the following guidelines:    "1. Any decision or initiative aimed at advancing the  national accord process should be based on the Addis Ababa  agreement and the provisional constitution referred to later in  this document, which is to be approved by the TNA.    "2. Respecting, protecting, and not harming the unity and  sovereignty of the Somali Republic's territory.    "3.

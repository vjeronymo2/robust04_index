			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / Hopes boosted by retail sales rise SALES IN high streets and shopping centres rose marginally last month, adding to evidence of a cautious recovery in consumer spending. Official figures issued yesterday showed that retail sales volumes rose a seasonally adjusted 0.2 per cent in February compared with January. The rise was slightly higher than expected and took the year-on-year rate of increase to 2.4 per cent. There was also an encouraging upward revision to January's sales. They rose by 2.2 per cent month-on-month compared with a provisional 1.6 per cent increase. Since July last year retail sales volumes have risen in every month except December. The Central Statistical Office said sales hit an all-time high in the three months to the end of February. The improvement in the past three months has not been spread evenly across the retail sector. While food retailers' sales rose by 3.3 per cent compared with the same period a year ago, non-food retailers' sales fell by 1.1 per cent. This was mainly due to a sharp fall in the 'other non-food' category of retail sales, which includes confectioners, newsagents, off-licences, booksellers, and toy and sports shops. Sales volumes fell by 6 per cent compared with the three months to February last year. Sales of clothing and footwear - which were particularly strong in February  -and household goods rose 1 per cent and 2 per cent respectively over the same period.</p>

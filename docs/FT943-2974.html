			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / South Wales region attracts most pit bids British Coal's south Wales region emerged yesterday as its most popular bid target as government advisers announced that 18 companies had submitted tenders for the corporation's mining assets to be privatised later this year. Although NM Rothschild, which is advising the government, would not reveal the identity or targets of the bidders, seven companies said they had submitted tenders for south Wales. Bids had to be in by Wednesday afternoon to be considered. Four companies said they had bid for the central north region and three each for the north-east and central south regions of England and Scotland. The number of bidders for each region may be higher, however. Five of the 18 companies which have bid have not made their intentions public. Aberthaw Mining, a company created by former BP Coal managers, emerged yesterday as one of the few bidders whose identity had previously been undisclosed. It said it had tendered for south Wales. The 18 bidders come from a group of 25 which 'pre-qualified' to bid this summer. Potential bidders which have decided against submitting tenders include RTZ, the mining conglomerate; National Power and PowerGen, the electricity generators; Banks and Law Mining, both coal companies; and AMEC, the construction company. Two pre-qualifiers, CP Holdings and Taylor Woodrow, confirmed yesterday that they had made bids. Kier Mining and Rackwood, both coal companies which pre-qualified, were not available for comment. Some of the bidders have put in tenders for one or more of the seven pits closed by British Coal this year and offered for sale separately. Caledonian Mining has put in a tender for Tower pit in south Wales, which is not part of the package on offer. Dr Keith Palmer, a managing director of Rothschild, said he had expected strong interest for the regions and collieries and this had been confirmed. He said: 'The quality as well as the number of bids is very positive.' The intention was to announce preferred bidders next month and to complete sales later this year. The confirmed bidders are: South Wales: Aberthaw Mining, Caledonian Mining, NSM, RJB Mining, Celtic Coal, Ryan Group and Wimpey/Powell Duffryn. Central North: Coal Investments/UDM, Northern Coal, RJB and English Coal. Central South: Coal Investments/UDM, RJB and English Coal. North East England: RJB, Ryan/Alcan and English Coal. Scotland: Mining (Scotland), RJB and ScotCoal. Miner changes, Page 12</p>

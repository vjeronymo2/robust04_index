The Chinese parliament chief emphasised the need to broaden  friendly cooperation between the two countries in politics,  economics, science, technology, and culture.    Qiao pointed out a considerable strengtheing of contacts  with  foreign countries over the past 15 years, RENMIN RIBAO reported  on Tuesday. This, he said, was resultant of an active  realisation of reforms and the open-door policy.    The Chinese parliament chief said China cannot do without  drawing on the experience of foreign countries in the  development of democracy and economics.    "However, one should not copy foreign models. One should act  in line with the country's current realities," Qiao said.    Muradov said Turkmenistan attaches much importance to the  development of contacts with China, whose experience may prove  useful for the development of the Turkmen economy, RENMIN RIBAO  reported.</p>

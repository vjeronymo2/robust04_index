			<p>940516 FT  16 MAY 94 / International Company News: SmithKline in agreement on cimetidine SmithKline Beecham, the Anglo-US drugs company, has reached an out-of-court settlement with Novopharm, a US manufacturer of generic unbranded drugs, and Schein, its distributor, on the marketing of cimetidine, a generic version of Tagamet, its best selling ulcer treatment drug. The US patent on Tagamet runs out tomorrow. Under the agreement, Novopharm will be able to market cimetidine from Wednesday. Last week, SmithKline applied for an injunction against Novopharm, citing patent and trademark infringements: Tagamet tablets are green, as were the cimetidine pills Novopharm proposed to sell. Under the settlement, Novopharm's cimetidine tablets will be a darker green rather than the pale green of Tagamet. Novopharm is likely to be one of many generics companies selling cimetidine. SmithKline has in the past said that up to 10 could eventually compete for the market. Tagamet's US sales are worth Dollars 650m a year. The generic products will be sold at a discount that Novopharm estimates to be 30 to 50 per cent of the branded drug's price. Previous price wars between generics companies with other products have taken the discount beyond 80 per cent.</p>

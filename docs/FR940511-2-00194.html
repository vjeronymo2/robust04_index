As noted in (a)(3) above, the operator failed to establish adequate means of communication and liaison with the local Coast Guard (public officials) as required by 49 CFR 192.615.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This advisory bulletin is based on two offshore pipeline failures and an NTSB safety recommendation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In March 1989, an ARCO production platform in the Gulf of Mexico was engulfed in flames and destroyed when a sudden release of gas ignited during repairs to a Southern Natural Gas Company (SONAT) 18 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; offshore pipeline. There were seven fatalities. In preparing for the repair work, SONAT began venting the pipeline to atmosphere through piping at the ARCO platform. Unfortunately, and unbeknown to SONAT, venting came to a halt when ARCO personnel isolated the platform by closing valves on all pipelines entering the platform, including SONAT's 18'' pipeline (ARCO did this in preparation for some platform maintenance work). As a result, the 18 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; pipeline which the SONAT crew began to repair, and which they thought had been safely vented free of flammables, still contained some gas and liquids. A cutting machine was being used on the pipeline's 18 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; riser at the platform, and as cutting neared completion, the pipe separated unexpectedly, releasing gas and liquids which ignited. In the judgment of Federal accident investigators, a lack of adequate coordination between both the producer's (ARCO) and the pipeline operator's (SONAT) field personnel was a significant contributing factor.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In October 1989, another pipeline failure involving fatalities occurred in the Gulf of Mexico. A fishing vessel, the Northumberland (crew of 14), punctured an NGPL 16 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; underwater transmission line carrying natural gas at 835 psig pressure. The escaping gas ignited almost immediately, creating a fireball which completely destroyed the vessel. Eleven (11) crew members perished. The incident happened at approximately 6:00 PM. However, gas flow feeding the fire was not fully shut off for over three hours, until shortly after 9:15 PM.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> According to the NTSB report, a major contributing factor in this long delay was the lack of a telephone number for contacting the operators of an unmanned production platform [refer to (a)(4) above]. As a result, NTSB Safety Recommendation P&hyph;90&hyph;31 was issued to RSPA, as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Evaluate, with the assistance of the Minerals Management Service, the need for emergency planning and coordination between offshore pipeline operators and producers, and then implement, if necessary, appropriate safety regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NTSB report also noted an inadequacy involving communications with local Coast Guard officials [refer to (b) above] and shortcomings [refer to (a)(1) through (a)(5) above].  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Issued in Washington, DC, on May 5, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUMMARY> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> George W.

			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Storehouse and LET unwind property deal STOREHOUSE, the high street retail store group, and London and Edinburgh Trust, the property company, are unwinding the joint venture they set up in March 1989. Storehouse also said yesterday that the search for a new chief executive continued but was unlikely to be completed soon. Mr David Dworkin left in February to join Carter Hawley Hale Stores in the US. The disentanglement of the venture, called Oppidan Estates, will involve Storehouse paying a net Pounds 37.5m to buy back 28 properties, mainly BhS stores. LET will buy Storehouse's half share and other retail assets including three Owen Owen department stores and some prime shop properties. Both sides said the deal made sense in 1989 but it was now better to untie the partnership. Storehouse said the effect would be neutral to current year earnings but should be positive in future years. Storehouse originally received Pounds 86m when the venture was set up near the peak of the retail property market. But it said changes in the portfolio since meant that the Pounds 37.5m cost of buying back the properties was not comparable. Storehouse has bought back the 28 shops for Pounds 67.7m and LET is paying Pounds 26.5m for Storehouse's half share in Oppidan plus Pounds 2.1m for three other properties. The net figure of Pounds 37.5m, is after tax. LET is keeping 15 properties with a value of Pounds 65.7m. A number of the BhS shops in the Oppidan portfolio were due to come up for rent reviews, so Storehouse is avoiding that future liability. It reckons it will save Pounds 6.5m a year in rental costs, but lose its share of Oppidan profits which were Pounds 2.7m in 1991-92. In 1989 Storehouse's profits were falling and its balance sheet was stretched. It was also being stalked by Mr Asher Edelman who had built up a 7.1 per cent stake in the group. The then chief executive Mr Michael Julien, who had joined in 1988, was looking for ways to cut debt and the Oppidan venture allowed Storehouse to move some properties off balance sheet.</p>

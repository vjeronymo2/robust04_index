			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Irina Savvateyeva article: "The Government Will Not Be </F> Able to Unravel the Budget"]    [Text] Yesterday the Russian government discussed the  budget for the third day running. The "budget sitting" was  still not over by the time this article was being prepared for  publication. The only thing that was clear was that  ratification of the estimate of state revenue and expenditure  was making slow headway.    One of the key questions is what the revenue figure will be.  The Finance Ministry insists that a figure of 120.7 trillion  rubles [R] is perfectly realistic. Chernomyrdin, however, is  demanding detailed validation. The point is that numerous  critics have repeatedly questioned the figure.    The sum of R120.7 trillion is 16.6 percent of GDP. Last  year's revenue of R17.2 trillion represented only 10.6 percent  of GDP. If you bear in mind that financial discipline has not  become much stricter, it should be recognized that the  difference is substantial. However, the Finance Ministry argues  that such a straight comparison is inappropriate, as the  procedure for calculating revenue and expenditure has been  somewhat modified this year (in particular tied credit,  investment-related credit, will now go through the budget --  which was not formerly the case). Thus, under comparable  conditions R120.7 trillion now represents, according to the  Finance Ministry's calculations, not 16.6 percent of GDP but  only 11.1 percent.    So you can argue about the figure, but there is nevertheless  a proposed growth in revenue in the 1994 draft budget compared  with last year's budget. How will this be achieved? The  Finance Ministry cites the following additional sources:  revenue from foreign economic activity, the procedure for  calculating which will now be changed; an increase in the  federal tax on profits; the introduction of a federal income tax  on the population (previously all 12 percent of it went into  local budgets, whereas 1 percent will now be paid into the  federal treasury); and -- the final additional source of revenue  -- new kinds of excise duty. They will be enumerated in a  special government decree.    However, it is not just revenue which generates questions. A  serious polemic is also developing over expenditure items.    There is very intensive discussion under way on the  financing  of the military-industrial complex. After two days of  discussion defense industry spokesmen failed to find a common  language with the Finance Ministry.    No final decision has been made on investment expenditure  either. The Finance Ministry considers that 53 trillion is the  maximum that the budget can bear. The Economy Ministry,  however, steadfastly insists that this is not enough to support  production.    The financing of the mass media is another painful problem.  The Finance Ministry has agreed in general terms to provide  subsidies; however, they are far more modest than those the mass  media were counting on. As is well known, payments for  communications services devour the lion's share of these  subsidies, and communications charges went up by a factor of 2.5  in January. The communications workers put this leap down to  the twofold increase in charges for electricity. It appears  that the government is inclined to think that the power workers  "have gone too far." At least the Commission for Operational  Management, headed by First Vice Premier Oleg Soskovets, insists  that is the case. And now the issue of subsidies to the mass  media is linked with the problems of the power workers.    So after two days of discussion in government a large  question mark still hangs over the revenue and expenditure  figures and the size of the budget deficit.</p>

There is constant  activity along the border by both Israel and the terrorist  elements, in particular Hizballah, he said. Major General  Yitzhaq Mordekhay said the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] is  operating inside the security zone and outside it according to  the policy decided on by the political echelon. He noted that  the understandings with Syria worked out in the wake of  Operation Accountability are still in effect. The Israeli side  of the northern border is not being shelled.    It is difficult to act against Hizballah when its members  operate in built-up areas populated by civilians, he said. Gen.  Mordekhay said that the IDF is carrying out initiated actions  because were it not doing so, the situation on the ground would  be worse. The general added that the IDF has drawn lessons from  Monday's [7 February] firefight in the al-Rayhan area in which  four soldiers were killed. Gen. Mordekhay made these remarks  to our army affairs correspondent, Karmela Menashe.</p>

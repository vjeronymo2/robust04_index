			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Expansion at Gibbon Lyons GIBBON LYONS, maker of printing inks and related products, finished the year ended March 31 1993 with a pre-tax profit of Pounds 1.41m, a rise of 75 per cent on the previous Pounds 806,000. However, in the full accounts the profit will fall to Pounds 990,000 after writing off goodwill on the sale of Gibbon Marler bv. The shares rose 6p to 104p. Mr Michael Gibbon, chairman, said the group continued to perform well in the second half, although there had been no significant improvement in trading conditions. Tight control of costs meant it could compete at reduced margins. Turnover for the year showed little change at Pounds 23.1m (Pounds 22.8m). Earnings per share worked through at 9.4p (4.8p) and the final dividend is 3p for an unchanged total of 5p.</p>

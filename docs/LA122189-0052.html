			<p><P> December 21, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JACK SMITH: LETTING THE CAT INTO THE BAG IS NO EASY ASSIGNMENT  </P> <P> In her View commentary the other day ("All I Want for Christmas Is a Minute's  Peace"), Megan Rosenfeld described the seasonal frenzy that drives women "way  out into the ozone."  </P> <P> She called it "Christmas stress" and suggested that it afflicts women more than  men, because men tend "to walk around thinking Christmas is something in the  distant future," while women go crazy trying to get everything done.  </P> <P> Rosenfeld's scenario certainly fits our house, except that she didn't mention  one factor that has complicated Christmas for us this year. I mean cats.  Rosenfeld mentioned cats only as a metaphor for the Christmas syndrome: "It  feels like a hot cat sitting on your chest, threatening to suck the breath out  of you like a vacuum cleaner."  </P> <P> The cats in our Christmas are real. They are not on our chest. They are on our  front porch. They are five wild cats, though one has been tamed, which only  adds to our frustration. My wife feeds them every morning.  </P> <P> They are a motley mother cat, her three black kittens, and the tame one -- an  orange male my wife took in from a previous wild litter, and, with great  patience, tamed to the point where he can be picked up, if he's in the mood. He  is tame only in a limited sense. He is mean, pugnacious, selfish, solitary,  recalcitrant and greedy. He is part of the problem.  </P> <P> The problem is that we are trying to catch the mother cat and the three kittens  (now several months old) to have them neutered. It's the only defense we have  against yet more litters.  </P> <P> My wife rented a trap for $3 a day. It is made of steel wire and sheet metal,  about four feet long, and looks like the Wright brothers' first airplane, with  flip-up doors at either end and a spring plate in the middle.  </P> <P> First you have to get the cat in the box. When it steps on the spring the doors  slam shut. We lured one of the black cats into the box with a bit of mackerel.  It made a terrible furor, screeching and whirling about and sticking its legs  out through the webbing. My wife drove it down to the vet. She had to leave it  overnight. We assumed the vet would tranquilize it with a shot before  operating.  </P> <P> "It's a male," he told my wife.  </P> <P> "How do you know?" she asked. We had never known.  </P> <P> He told her. Specifically.  </P> <P> We had bought three collars to mark the neutered cats. The next day she brought  the cat home; it wore a red collar. We baited the box again, but no luck.  </P> <P> "I'll pick one up and stuff her in it," I told my wife.  </P> <P> With the box open nearby I reached down and grabbed one of the black cats by  the middle. It turned into a ball of fury. It dug its claws into my hands and  wrists. I dropped it. Immediately the blood spurted from half a dozen wounds.  The cat fled.  </P> <P> Miraculously, a second black cat ventured into this infernal machine and we  trapped it. The noise the cat made was demoralizing.  </P> <P> When my wife went to pick it up the next day, she could hear it yowling. The  vet had given it a name. Noisy Cat. It was a male.  </P> <P> We have yet to capture the other black cat or the mother. The tame male  compounds the problem because he has no fear of the trap. But we don't want  him. The mother cat came into the house the other day and we slammed the door.  She had never been trapped inside before.  </P> <P> In her panic she put on a show that was galvanizing. She ripped along the  window sills, riffling the metal shutters. She leaped up on tables, scattering  objets d'art. She scooted through the rooms. She hid under the bed. She tried  to jump through the windows. We threw the door open and finally she streaked  out.  </P> <P> We have yet to catch the third black cat. My wife thinks it is a male too. I  don't know why. Meanwhile, she is trying to address 300 Christmas cards, wrap  presents, do her shopping, dress for parties, microwave our dinners, pay the  bills, carry out the trash and do all the other chores of Christmas.  </P> <P> We have no hope of ever catching the mother cat.  </P> <P> Merry Christmas.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Today, TRABAJADORES published an article criticizing  statements on Cuba by U.S. President William Clinton. In his  article, reporter and analyst Nicanor Leon Cotallo points out  that Clinton's recent statements on Cuba are part of the  strategy suggested by his advisers to obtain an electoral  victory in the State of Florida. Leon goes on to say that  Clinton's 20 May attacks on the Cuban Government demonstrate  that obtaining a victory in that state during the 1996 elections  has become an obsession for the president's team of advisers.    In his article, Leon states that this goes hand in hand with  the viewpoint of the most extreme right and the intolerant  factions of the Cuban community in Florida. Leon goes on to say  that even though Clinton is not part of the extreme right, as  his successors Ronald Reagan and George Bush were, he must know  very little about Cuba, the only explanation for his error, or  lack of precision in talking about a long history of cooperation  and mutual admiration between Cuba and the United States.    Regarding Clinton's defense of the blockade against Cuba,  the  article in TRABAJADORES states that this contradicts the  agreements of the UN General Assembly and the opinion of the  principal U.S. newspapers.</p>

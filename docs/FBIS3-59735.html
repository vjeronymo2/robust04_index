			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] The generational change is accelerating for  application specific ICs (ASICs). 0.5&mgr;m subminiature  processing technologies used in the production of 16Mbit DRAMs  are beginning to be seriously applied in the production of the  ASIC, and the delay between use of technology for advanced  memories and application to the ASIC is becoming shorter. On the  other hand, companies are wrapping up development of 1&mgr;m  processes; and in contrast to the DRAM, which is shifting to a  generational co-existence market structure, significant changes  are being incorporated into the ASIC based on customer demand.  <H5>  Lower Power Consumption, Higher Speed </H5>   In the past, LSI technology has driven the development of  the  DRAM in the Japanese semiconductor industry--two to three years  after DRAM mass production has started using the most advanced  ultrafine fabrication technology, the same generation technology  has been applied to production of the ASIC.    However, production of the 0.5&mgr;m ASIC is already about  to  begin, even though production of the 16M DRAM started during  1992-93.    Fujitsu, which began production of the 0.5&mgr;m ASIC  without  delay, is expanding production lines at its Aizu Wakamatsu  factory. Toshiba has also begun expansion at its Iwate facility  and is preparing a trial production line in the United States.  NEC recently announced that it will produce a 0.5&mgr;m  cell-based  IC in Yamaguchi, following on the heels of the gate array  produced in 1992.    In contrast to the DRAM market, which has experienced a  slow-forming market, NEC reported that ``demand will grow  relatively quickly'' for the 0.5&mgr;m ASIC, in conjunction with  demand for low power consumption and fast operating speed in  portable type equipment. Toshiba reports that the momentum will  make 0.5&mgr;m products the mainstay in terms of quality, by  1995.    At first, in order to comply with requirements for personal  computer and multimedia applications chiefly in the United  States and create a market for the 0.5&mgr;m ASIC, it was  necessary to upgrade the level of system technologies. This was  because if the level of integration was raised using ultrafine  fabrication technologies, it would take more effort than even  before to design one product, and from the user's viewpoint  design improvement was reaching its upper limit.  <H5>  New Development on 1&mgr;m Products Being Wrapped Up </H5>   Therefore, companies involved in device production are  quickly abandoning the design of older generation products in  order to focus engineering efforts. In particular, NEC and  Fujitsu have discontinued taking new orders for products using  1&mgr;m and older technologies. Toshiba is also devoting  night-and-day efforts toward the development of submicron  products.    Of course, as always, the production of 2&mgr;m devices will  continue as before. however, if the engineering shift and demand  structure match, it appears that the production scale of ASICs  using 1&mgr;m and older technology will shrink faster than that  of  the 1M, which used 1&mgr;m technology and experienced strong  demand.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Deputy Antoine Joseph, member of the Movement To  Establish Democracy in Haiti and former lower chamber president,  has asserted that the Jonassaint government is illegal and  unconstitutional and that he does not recognize the current  power's authority. Deputy Joseph believes the government that  was installed by a group of legislators and not by the entire  legislative corps operates beyond the constitutional provisions  provided for in that respect. Deputy Joseph, who noted friction  between the executive, the parliament, and the position of the  political parties, considers that all the conditions have been  met to overthrow the Jonassaint government.

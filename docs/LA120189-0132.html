			<p><P> December 1, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> WRONG-WAY DRIVER DIES IN HEAD-ON FREEWAY CRASH  </P> <P> A man who drove the wrong way for at least four miles on the Golden State  Freeway was killed Thursday when he collided head-on with another car on the  freeway in Pacoima, the California Highway Patrol reported.  </P> <P> Investigators identified the driver as Winfred McCollum, 86, of Altadena, who  was killed in the 2 p.m. accident just north of the Van Nuys Boulevard exit,  CHP Officer Tami Low said. The driver of the other car, Eric Deshon, 24, of  Canyon Country, suffered major injuries and was being treated at Holy Cross  Medical Center in Mission Hills.  </P> <P> McCollum was going south at about 55 m.p.h. in a non-traffic buffer lane on the  northbound side of the freeway's concrete center divider, Low said. He was  first reported near Roxford Street in Sylmar, about four miles from where the  fatal crash took place.  </P> <P> A Los Angeles police officer driving south spotted the wrong-way car on the  other side of the center divider but was unable to stop the car. He told CHP  investigators that the driver appeared to be confused.  </P> <P> Low said investigators believe that McCollum saw a break in the oncoming  traffic and attempted to veer across the freeway to the Van Nuys Boulevard exit  but hit Deshon's car head-on.  </P> <P> The accident closed two southbound lanes for 90 minutes and caused traffic to  back up through the northeastern San Fernando Valley, Low said.  </P></p>

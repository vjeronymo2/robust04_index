			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Carlton wanted A positive round of presentations, together with technical corrections, benefited Carlton Communications, shares in the media group jumping 27 to 748p. Turnover was a good 3.1m. UBS Phillips and Drew were said to be positive, arguing that fears of new technology hitting its video duplication business had been overdone. The broker also emphasised Carlton's product arm where sales of the Qantel video component system are thought strong. Goldman Sachs also lifted its profit forecast after seeing the company, moving up Pounds 5m to Pounds 128m this year, and by Pounds 3m to Pounds 155m for 1993. However, media specialists also pointed out that the stock had fallen back in recent weeks and was due a recovery.</p>

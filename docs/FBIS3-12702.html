The new development at the political level was the  announcement that the Council of Ministers will convene in Aden  today for five days under the chairmanship of Prime Minister  Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas. Meanwhile the military situation  continued to deteriorate in Abyan Governorate and in the 'Imran  area, north of Sanaa, after 24 hours of cautious calm. The  Council of Ministers meetings in Aden will be devoted to  examining measures concerning the implementation of the Pledge  and Accord Document signed by party leaders in Amman 20 February.    However, a prominent minister belonging to the General  People's Congress [GPC], which is led by Lieutenant General 'Ali  'Abdallah Salih, chairman of the Presidential Council, pointed  to the possibility that the GPC ministers will boycott the  Council of Ministers meetings in Aden.    Al-'Attas said that the "call for the ministerial meeting in  Aden came from the dialogue committee in its meeting on 24  February in Sanaa, specifically from one of its members, namely  'Abd-al-Wahhab al-Anasi, secretary general of the Yemeni Reform  Grouping and deputy prime minister, who headed the committee  meeting at the which the call for convening the Council of  Ministers in Aden was announced."    The Yemeni prime minister told AL-HAYAH that "the  deteriorating conditions require that a schedule be drawn up to  prepare the atmosphere and normalize political conditions,  ensuring that this program coincides with the implementation of  the Pledge and Accord Document and makes it possible to activate  the various organizations."    Al-'Attas declined to "talk about the serious military  deterioration some governorates are experiencing." He merely  pointed out that "it is regrettable, and there is a military  committee and a committee for dialogue among the political  forces. Its task is to halt military operations, which pose a  serious threat to the homeland's unity."    Despite the military quarters' repeated denial that there is  any new fighting in Abyan or north of Sanaa, where the 5th  Brigade belonging to former Yemeni President 'Ali Nasir Muhammad  is stationed, the Defense Ministry in Yemen insisted on  confirming the military deterioration.    Aden sources said that the military situation in Abyan  Governorate in the south and the area of Harf Sufyan, north of  the capital, Sanaa, witnessed a serious development yesterday.  And that military officials in the south stress that what is  happening is "the start of Somalization, unless a quick solution  is found."    The Defense Ministry statement in Aden yesterday pointed out  that the "northern al-'Amaliqah Brigade, which is stationed in  Abyan, has continued to deploy its personnel and various types  of weapons, including rocket launchers and heavy artillery,  toward the areas of al-Saylah, al-Bayda', Modiyah, Wadi Dufas,  al-Dirjaj, and occupied Jabal Sarar, in addition to its  large-scale deployment in Zanjibar, capital of the governorate."    The statement pointed to the existence of "movements and  deployments north of Sanaa, as northern troops from Sanaa headed  toward the 5th Brigade to help the forces besieging the brigade  belonging to 'Ali Nasir Muhammad." The statement confirmed that  "the 5th Brigade's commander, Colonel 'Abdallah al-Shalil,  managed to withdraw to al-Jawf area with the help of the Bakil  tribes." [passage omitted]    In a statement to AL-HAYAH Col. al-Shalil, who was contacted  from Aden yesterday, said that "the ferocious attacks he  experienced were a war of annihilation against the 5th Brigade,  which was subjected to a ferocious offensive using various types  of weapons from Saturday evening until its withdrawal the day  before yesterday."

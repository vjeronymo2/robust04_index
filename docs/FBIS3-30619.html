			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A statement by Romania's president, Ion Iliescu, in  connection with yesterday's attack in Sarajevo has been faxed to  our editorial office. Here is the entire text of this statement:    I was shocked and indignant at the news of this new  irresponsible attack against the city of Sarajevo, which claimed  a great number of victims among the civilian population who lack  the protection of the city. We deplore the loss of human lives  and want to express our profound condolences to the mourning  families. We very firmly condemn this new barbarian act of  terrorism and express the hope that those who have committed it  will be identified and receive the punishment they deserve. The  attack in Sarajevo does nothing but emphasize, in a dramatic  way, the fact that resorting to force of arms prolongs human  suffering, without solving problems, and it emphasizes the  urgency for the necessity of a peace settlement in  Bosnia-Herzegovina -- an objective to which all diplomatic  efforts should now be devoted, the statement by Romania's  president concludes.</p>

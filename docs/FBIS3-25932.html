The conference pointed out that in 1994, Hubei's labor work  should proceed by focusing on key aspects, overcoming  difficulties, fostering and developing a labor market, and  gradually establishing a new labor system which conforms with a  socialist market economic structure.    The conference also emphatically called for rapidly building  employment consultation institutions; strengthening management  of nongovernmental employment consultation institutions; further  expanding labor cooperation with other provinces and  municipalities, especially coastal and economically developed  regions; vigorously implementing an all-personnel labor contract  system; and improving professional and occupational  qualifications assessment work. To this end, the conference  stated, it is imperative to establish a batch of authoritative  professional and occupational qualifications assessment  institutions at both provincial and prefectural levels within  the year; actively develop social security undertakings as well  as relevant economic organizations in both cities and towns  across the province to establish a uniform, societywide, and  omnidirectional social security system tailored to the needs of  old-aged people. In order to properly coordinate labor  relations, it is also imperative to carry out large-scale  propaganda on good labor relations with a view to tackling some  long-standing problems, such as unauthorized labor employment,  willful lengthening of working hours, willful deduction of labor  wages, noncompliance with labor safety standards, refusal to pay  social security premium, illegal labor trade, and so on. It is  also imperative to strictly regulate and control aggregate labor  wage volume. At present, it is imperative to comprehensively  implement and perfect a planned dynamic wage system in light of  actual tax burdens.    The conference also urged stringent labor safety supervision  and reduction of all types of labor accidents.    Li Daqiang, provincial party committee standing committee  member and provincial vice governor, delivered a speech at the  end of the conference.</p>

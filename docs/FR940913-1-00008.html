This action is required by section 101B of the Agricultural Act of 1949 (1949 Act), as amended. This proposed rule outlines a range of acreage reduction percentage options proposed for the 1995 crop of rice and requests comments regarding price support rate adjustments for different types and grades of rice. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments must be received on or before October 24, 1994 in order to be assured of consideration. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments must be mailed to Director, Fibers and Rice Analysis Division (FRAD), Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service (ASCS), U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), P.O.

A Preliminary Regulatory Impact Analysis was prepared that determined that this regulation will have no significant impact on a substantial number of small entities because the particular acreage reduction percentages considered will not affect the paperwork, reporting, or compliance burdens of the small entities in the program. CCC thus certifies that the rule will have no significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. The Preliminary Regulatory Impact Analysis describing the options considered in developing this proposed rule and the impact of the implementation of each option is available on request from the above-named individual.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Environmental Evaluation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> It has been determined by an environmental evaluation that this action will have no significant impact on the quality of the human environment.

A paid land diversion program is not considered because, given the considered program options, it is not needed to achieve the statutory stocks-to-use levels of rice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  If an ARP is announced, the reduction shall be achieved by applying a uniform percentage reduction (from 0 to 35 percent) to the rice crop acreage base for the crop for each rice producing farm. In making such a determination, the number of acres placed into the agricultural resources conservation program established under subtitle D of title XII of the Food Security Act of 1985, as amended, must be taken into consideration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Producers who knowingly produce rice in excess of the permitted acreage for the farm plus any rice acreage planted in accordance with the flexibility provisions are ineligible for loans and purchases and all payments with respect to that crop on the farm.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

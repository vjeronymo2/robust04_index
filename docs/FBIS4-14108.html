In an earlier statement to MENA, Dahlan said that an  agreement was reached to release 2,500 Palestinian detainees two  days after the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho agreement is  signed, 2,000 other detainees will be released after the Israeli  withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho is completed, 500 will be  released one month after the withdrawal, and 2,000 will be set  free after the beginning of negotiations to implement  Palestinian self-rule. He noted that no agreement has been  reached on the procedure for releasing the other 1,400 detainees.    Palestinian sources said that camps are being prepared in  Rafah to receive the Palestinian police force that will be  deployed in Gaza after the final signing of the implementation  of the Gaza-Jericho agreement. These sources said that Egypt  offered facilities and equipment for these camps. They noted  that the Palestinian police force consists of 7,000 personnel  from outside the occupied territories in addition to 2,000 from  inside them.</p>

			<p><P> April 27, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: RADIO  </P> <P> Good Morgan: Veteran comedian Pat Buttram will start delivering a few minutes  of humorous commentary on Robert W. Morgan's morning KMPC radio program  beginning Monday. "I finally got tired of all the deejays in the morning  quoting my jokes. . . . I decided to start getting paid for all those jokes,"  Buttram said Wednesday. Morgan's 5:30-9 a.m. show will include the daily  feature "Pat Buttram on Location" during which Buttram will call in from around  the country and comment on the day's news events or other topical material.  "It'll be kind of on-the-scene commentary about whatever is going on," said  Buttram, 70, who got his start in radio in 1934. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

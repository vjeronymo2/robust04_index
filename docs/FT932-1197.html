			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Biggest zinc producer adopts 'no growth' policy UNION MINIERE of Belgium wants to give up its role as the world's biggest zinc producer, said Mr Jean-Pierre Rodier, the chief executive, yesterday. He said UM's new management: Had cancelled a BF10bn (Pounds 195m) project to double annual capacity from 200,000 tonnes at the Balen zinc refinery in Belgium. Would within five years sell its Union Zinc refinery and associated mines in the US where about 100,000 tonnes a year are produced compared with UM's total output of 530,000 tonnes last year. Would also within five years dispose of its zinc mines in Sweden which last year produced 111,000 tonnes of concentrate (an intermediate material). At the end of last year UM permanently closed its zinc refining plant at Overpelt in Belgium, removing 100,000 tonnes or 2 per cent of western world production capacity. Mr Rodier, talking to the Association of Mining Analysts in London yesterday, said UM was not particularly proud of being the world's biggest zinc producer with an 11 per cent market share. While UM would develop and grow its copper, zinc recycling and Hoboken precious and special metals divisions, it was following a 'no growth' policy for the zinc refining division which would be used as a cash cow for the next ten years. 'Within five years our profits will be much less exposed to zinc prices,' he promised. Mr Rodier said for 20 years there had been too much zinc refining capacity in Europe. UM had done its part to improve the situation by closing Overpelt. However, it would be willing to take part in a plan being formulated by European Community producers where one or two of them would permanently shut smelters and other EC producers would provide cash to cover the closure costs. He implied other producers wanted the European Commission also to take action against zinc imports from eastern Europe by way of tariffs and quotas but UM would not support any such moves unless the industry first agreed to address the problem of overcapacity. Mr Rodier said it would probably take eight to 12 months for the industry to agree a voluntary closure scheme and start putting it into effect.</p>

			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / International Company News: Phillips expects operating loss PHILLIPS Petroleum, the Oklahoma-based energy and chemicals group, said it expected to post an operating loss in the first quarter, Reuter reports. The company said it would also take two special charges. The first is an estimated Dollars 93m pre-tax charge for workforce reductions which took place in the first quarter. The second is a Dollars 39m pre-tax extraordinary loss related to the early retirement, through refinancing, of the company's 13 3/4 per cent subordinated debentures and 13 7/8 per cent senior notes. The refinancing of an early debt redemption is expected to reduce the company's annual pre-tax interest expense by about Dollars 100m a year, based on recent interest rate levels. Phillips's total debt was Dollars 4.3bn on March 31.</p>

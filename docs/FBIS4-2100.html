			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Jia Anping (6328 1344 1627)] </F>   [Text] Rio de Janeiro, 4 Apr (XINHUA) -- General Chi  Haotian, Chinese state councillor and concurrently minister of  national defense, watched on 4 April brilliant training  exercises by Brazil's most important military unit, the First  Army Division, and troops stationed at the Military Village in  Rio de Janeiro.    At 1000, Chi Haotian -- along with Lieutenant General Li  Laizhu, commander of the Beijing Military Region; Lieutenant  General Yu Zhenyu, deputy commander of the Air Force; and other  members of his retinue -- arrived by car at the First Army  Division, headquartered at the Military Village. From the  reviewing stand, Chi Haotian inspected well-equipped units under  the First Army Division, including motorized infantry, armored  cavalry, field and anti- aircraft artillery, air defense,  reconnaissance, and guard units; as well as the airborne  infantry brigade affiliated with the Eastern Military Region.    Brazil's First Army Division consists of 22,000 officers and  men. Its predecessor, the First Strategy Brigade, was founded in  1908. During World War II, the division's troops were  incorporated into the First Expeditionary Division and took part  in the war against Fascism in Italy. In addition, they also  joined international peacekeeping forces on two occasions.    Then, the Chinese Defense Minister, accompanied by Brazilian  Division Commander General Leonel, watched live ammunition  exercises performed by the division's special task battalion and  anti-terrorist shock brigade with great interest. At the  airborne infantry brigade's parachute training center, Chi  Haotian also viewed paratroopers' physical fitness, skills,  mental readiness, and simulated parachute exercises.    Founded in 1945, the parachute training center is mainly in  charge of the teaching, fieldwork, and training of paratroopers;  as well as the research and development of personnel training  techniques and parachute materials. So far, the center has  trained some 50,000 certified paratroopers for 10 countries,  including Argentina, Chile, the United States, and France.  After watching the exercises, Chi Haotian told the gracious  hosts: "There is much in your well-equipped training center's  hardworking soldiers and flexible training methods that we can  learn from."    Chi Haotian and his retinue arrived here on 2 April to begin  a visit. This is the first time a Chinese defense minister has  visited Latin American countries since the PRC's founding in  1949. Brazil is the first leg of the visit. The minister and  his retinue will visit Uruguay and Chile.</p>

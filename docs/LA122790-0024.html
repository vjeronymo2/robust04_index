			<p><P> December 27, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROTESTS AGAINST GULF ACTIONS  </P> <P> Regarding Ruth Rosen's "A Grass-Roots War Resistance Is Blossoming"  (Commentary, Dec. 13):  </P> <P> I want to support the idea that the spontaneous grass-roots opposition to  potential war in the gulf is comprised mainly of ordinary citizens, not  radicals. The East San Gabriel Valley, where I teach, has long been identified  with conservative politics.  </P> <P> Yet resistance to war is strong in the area.  </P> <P> Specifically, at Citrus College in Glendora, I am the faculty sponsor for 61  Students for Peace in the Middle East. In the group are army reservists,  citizens born in the Middle East, potential draft resisters, mothers of  draft-age sons and several self-described "super patriots." This diverse group  is only united by its common concern for peace. In just a few weeks this group  has gathered signatures from 482 faculty and students on a peace petition. It  reads, in part, ". . . we urge a peaceful resolution to the gulf crisis through  economic sanctions and negotiation."  </P> <P> Indeed, a grass-roots war resistance is blossoming and it is neither left or  right in orientation.  </P> <P> KEITH F. SHIREY  </P> <P> Pasadena  </P></p>

			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / Era of efficiency and cost-cutting outlined WOMEN may train to become commandos, the Citizen's Charter is to be enacted at the Meteorological Office and a 'green minister', Lord Cranborne, has been appointed at the Ministry of Defence. Those are just three of the ideas in this year's defence white paper. But the underlying message is little changed from last year: the 1990s will be a period of efficiency drives and cost-cutting. The commitment to developing 'smaller but better forces' following the two-year-old Options for Change programme of cuts is restated. The procurement side has been pruned in an effort to keep within the Treasury's Pounds 24bn-Pounds 25bn target for annual spending until 1995. One casualty is the Trigat medium-range anti-tank missile programme. Spending plans now only take it through its development phase and not to production. That cuts the cost of the project from Pounds 920m to Pounds 125m and follows a similar decision last year on the long-range version of Trigat. However, many spending plans do survive. They include the re-equipping of the First Armoured Division with new tanks, armoured vehicles, artillery and other systems that will increase its combat capabilities by 25 per cent by 1995, and by more than a third by 2000. The white paper confirms that more plastic-hulled Sandown-class minehunters will be ordered. That will provide some reassurance to Vosper Thornycroft, the smallest of the UK's four warship yards, which last January announced about 350 job losses, partly as the result of a postponement of the Royal Navy order. More than 75 per cent of defence contracts in the past year were placed by competition or priced by reference to to market forces, the white paper says. The ministry is conducting a feasibility study on the creation of a European armaments agency with a view to easing cross-border arms procurement. Other lessons learnt from civilian privatisation are also working their way into the military. The introduction last year of a New Management Strategy has led this year to the analysis of defence resources by budget-holder rather than by programme. The biggest budget-holder is UK Land Forces, which covers the armed forces outside Germany, with Pounds 2bn to spend; followed by the Chief of Fleet Support, which provides logistical support for the navy, with Pounds 1.6bn. Those figures exclude equipment procurement. The strategy, which introduced efficiency targets for planning and resource allocations, is designed to save 1.5 per cent of the defence budget in its first year, with a target of 2.5 per cent savings in each of the next three years. Such measures should save up to Pounds 4bn annually within three years, Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, said yesterday. The ministry has also begun a period of 'simulated trading' with the Defence Research Agency, which it hopes will lead to the agency, which consists of four military research establishments, becoming a trading fund from April next year. Trading-fund status would allow it to retain some of the revenues it generates. A total of 11 agencies, such as the Defence Research Agency and the Meteorological Office, each now has its own chief executive, who is 'personally accountable for the efficient and effective management of the activities under their control'. The chief executives will also be responsible for compliance with the Citizen's Charter. The white paper also outlines plans for the ministry to subsidise personnel who want to buy property. Several other initiatives including ventures with housing associations are planned. The white paper contains precise numbers of equipment for the first time. For exam-ple, the number of advanced medium-range air-to-air missiles to be bought for the Royal Navy's Sea Harrier jump jets is 210, with 100 heavy Spearfish torpedoes. However some figures, such as the number of Sting Ray lightweight torpedoes, remain classified. The ministry has set up an environmental task force under Lord Cranborne to ensure compliance with international protocols on ozone-layer depletion. Studies are under way into the feasibility of employing women in the infantry, the Royal Marines commando forces and the Royal Armoured Corps. But Mr Archie Hamilton, armed forces minister, said there was a 'certain reluctance' about seeing women in the front line. He said: 'We are looking right across the board and investigating what roles women should take, but it is unlikely that the recommendation will be that they can go to the infantry.'</p>

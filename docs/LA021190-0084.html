			<p><P> February 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MIXED MEDIA;  </P> <P> ** "CCCP -- THE VIDEO MIX" UB40 A&amp;M VIDEO LASER DISC ($29.99)  </P> <P> Passports and cigarettes (invaluable for barter) aren't the only things that  pop stars apparently feel are essential when heading to Russia.  </P> <P> There are also video crews and recording equipment. Elton John, Billy Joel, Bon  Jovi and the Scorpions have either recorded live albums or made documentaries  during their Soviet excursions. For this concert documentary, the footage isn't  much more involving than something you'd expect if one of the members of this  gently soulful English reggae-pop group took along his own video camera. But  UB40 isn't a particularly dynamic act live, so the non-concert scenes (mostly  elementary sightseeing) add a welcome, if still limited visual diversion.  Robert Hilburn  </P></p>

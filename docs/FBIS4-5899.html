			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 15 (YONHAP) -- North Korea has  prohibited its loggers working in Siberia from leaving or  sleeping outside their camps, a Foreign Ministry official said  Friday.    "North Korea permitted the loggers to go out and sleep on  some special days in the past such as April 15, the birthday of  President Kim Il-song, and Aug. 15, independence day from  Japanese colonial rule, on a large scale. But this year the  Pyongyang government banned it completely on April 15," the  official said on condition he not be named.    North Korea seems to think that if Seoul admits defecting  loggers to South Korea, more loggers will desert their camps.  North Korean guards at the camps have thus increased  surveillance of workers and banned movement to outside areas,  the official said.    He expressed concern that North Korean loggers left camp in  the past to buy daily necessities and food in Khabarovsk, but  now they cannot do so.</p>

			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Concert party at Liberty Mr Brian Myerson, who has forced a number of changes at Liberty, yesterday announced a concert party with a Malaysian group to press for further changes at the upmarket fabric and fashion group. Mr Myerson and Insas, an investment holding company quoted on the Kuala Lumpur stock exchange with a market capitalisation of Pounds 205m, will control 16.8 per cent of Liberty's capital after June's enfranchisement of the non-voting shares. Mr Myerson's family vehicle - Concerto Capital Corporation - will hold 12.8 per cent and Insas 4 per cent. Since he began his campaign in 1992, Mr Myerson has been instrumental in the appointment of a new chief executive at Liberty, the appointment of non-executive directors and the enfranchisement. This will reduce the votes controlled by the founding families from just over 50 per cent to about 40 per cent. Mr Myerson said the object of the concert party was to 'maximise Liberty's value to all shareholders'. This, he said, included developing markets in the Pacific Rim, improving merchandising, and promoting changes of personnel at the company. Liberty's success at its new outlet at Heathrow's Terminal 3 has led to the view that there is pent-up demand in east Asia.</p>

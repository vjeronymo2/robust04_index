			<p>BFN     [Text] Dar es Salaam, April 30 (AFP) -- Tanzanian President  Ali Hassan Mwinyi praised South Africans for successfully  conducting their first democratic elections ever, and urged them  maintain peace after the polls, officials said Saturday [30  April].    "It is only through reconciliation that the people of South  Africa can be able to build a new, peaceful and progressive  country," Mwinyi said in a statement to the media.    Mwinyi said the whole world was satisfied with last week's  historic elections, which ended centuries of white minority in  South Africa.    Tanzania was a strident critic of South Africa's apartheid  policy which disenfranched the majority black community.    Mwinyi pledged to cooperate with whatever government comes  to  power after the elections results are declared.</p>

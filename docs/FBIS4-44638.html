			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by P. D.: "Olivetti Prepares Multimedia Line"] </F>   [Text] Olivetti plans to take advantage of the IT Forum  show to launch a line of multimedia PC's designed primarily for  the general consumer market, as well as a communicating PC  equipped with an integrated videoconferencing system. Two  principal models of the "Domus Life" line will be on the market  during the first quarter of 1994, in ready-to-use configurations.    The PCS Television integrates a video card and tuner, and  includes loudspeakers. The user can thus view television on the  entire screen or in a Windows window, but can also capture  images and construct video montages with the aid of the software  provided.    The PCS Educator offers a 16-bit Pro Audio Spectrum sound  card, a single-speed multisession CD-ROM reader, loudspeakers,  and a number of applications on CD-ROM.    After a good takeoff in low-priced PC's for the mass market,  but devoid of configurations aimed at the general public,  Olivetti is supplementing its line with more sophisticated  products capable of providing a real dimension of entertainment  and education. Vis-a-vis Compaq and IBM, therefore, Olivetti's  product line will now include, on the one hand, cheaper  machines, and on the other, more complete and innovative models.</p>

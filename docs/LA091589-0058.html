			<p><P> September 15, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA: SDSU SELLS FEWER TICKETS FOR FOOTBALL SEASON  </P> <P> San Diego State has announced that football season ticket sales for the 1989  season were down 19.8% from last year.  </P> <P> The Aztecs sold 12,154 season tickets for the seven-game home schedule that  opens Saturday night against UCLA at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium. Last year,  the Aztecs sold 15,148 for a five-game home schedule. Both figures include  sales of discounted student season tickets.  </P> <P> Revenue from season tickets was reported at $612,167, up slightly from last  year's $595,765 because of a price increase with the two extra home games.  </P> <P> But the figure is about $106,000 below the athletic department's budgeted  figure for football season ticket revenue.  </P> <P> SDSU has lost its second basketball recruit to academic difficulties. Steve  McClellan, a 6-foot-6 forward from Arizona Western College in Yuma, has been  denied admission, said John Rosenthal, sports information director.  </P> <P> McClellan, who attended Fresno Edison High School, averaged 11 points and nine  rebounds last year as sophomore at Arizona Western. Earlier, the Aztecs lost  guard Ray Barefield, a 6-1 guard from Fresno Hoover, when he failed to meet  National Collegiate Athletic Assn. freshman eligibility requirements.  </P> <P> VOLLEYBALL  </P> <P> Mike Dodd and Tim Hovland will try to make it a clean sweep with their third  victory in the $100,000 Jose Cuervo Gold Crown today and Saturday at Mariner's  Point in Mission Bay.  </P> <P> Dodd, who played basketball and volleyball at San Diego State, and Hovland have  already won the first two tournaments of the triple crown of beach volleyball,  at Boulder, Colo., and Clearwater, Fla. The tournaments are each worth $50,000  to the winning team.  </P> <P> Challenging Dodd and Hovland will be Sinjin Smith, the all-time leading money  winner, and Randy Stoklos, the tour's most valuable player last season. Smith  and Stoklos have won more tournaments than any team in the sport's history.  </P></p>

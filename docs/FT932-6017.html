			<p>930601 FT  01 JUN 93 / TV, radio nominees rejected by ANC EFFORTS to appoint an independent board of governors for the state-owned South African Broadcasting Corporation foundered last night, the African National Congress having rejected board appointments announced earlier in the day by President FW de Klerk. He met Mr Nelson Mandela, the ANC leader, yesterday to discuss the appointments, but the ANC later accused Mr de Klerk of 'gross interference' in the selection, saying the independence of the board had been compromised. The ANC called on new board members, including the chairman-designate, Prof Frederick van Zyl Slabbert, to refuse their appointments, a call which many will find difficult to refuse. Mr Pallo Jordan, ANC information director, defended the ANC action by arguing that Mr de Klerk had violated the process agreed with the ANC for appointing board members - choice based on recommendations by an independent, multi-racial panel of jurists. The panel's first two lists were rejected by the president, including its choice of chairman, Prof Njabulo Ndebele of the radical University of the Western Cape. Mr de Klerk complained that the high political profile of some nominees violated agreed criteria. 'By his unilateral action President de Klerk has undermined a cardinal principle that underpinned this entire process - that it be free of government or political party influence. This calls into question the SABC's future independence,' the ANC stated. Mr de Klerk also rejected left-wing nominees such Mr Jakes Gerwel, radical rector of the University of the Western Cape, left-wing journalists Mr Moeletsi Mbeki and Mr Khaba Mkhize, and Mr Allister Sparks, former Rand Daily Mail editor The row will complicate the choosing of a board to ensure the impartiality of the SABC in the run-up to the country's first multi-racial elections, due by April next. Constitutional negotiators plan to announce an election date on Thursday, though there are signs a delay to the announcement.</p>

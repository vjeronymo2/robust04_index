President Clinton reiterated his support  for Ciller in a surprise message to her yesterday. He said he  will support Turkey's effort to effect economic reform.    Clinton's five-page message reached Ankara through  diplomatic  channels yesterday. It replied to the expectations and requests  that Ciller conveyed to President Clinton during their telephone  conversations and in recent messages they exchanged.    Clinton reportedly replied to Ciller's request for U.S.  support to the Turkish economy by saying that $5 billion of  Eximbank credit has been released for Turkey's imports. The  U.S. Eximbank credit can only be used for imports from that  country.    Clinton's message also expressed support for Turkey's  request  for World Bank credit. It said the United States would adopt a  constructive approach toward concluding the negotiations on a  World Bank credit package for Turkey of $2.7 billion.    The Gulf Fund was another issue in which President Clinton  promised to support Ciller. Her request regarding that fund was  one of the most important appeals to the United States. The  Gulf Fund, earmarked for the second phase of the F-16 project in  Turkey, is being held in the United States. It was established  with a contribution by the Gulf States for the production of 160  F-16 aircraft. Ciller has asked that the fund be placed under  the Turkish Treasury Department's control.    Although the United States has not opposed the transfer of  the fund to Turkey, it has objected to the use of the fund for  other purposes. But the message said Clinton has agreed to a  formula that will enable Turkey to benefit from the interest on  the fund.    President Clinton's message failed to satisfy Ciller's  expectation of an agreement to have the oil embargo on Iraq  relaxed. On the possibility of the withdrawal of a limited  amount of oil from the pipeline between Turkey and Iraq, the  message is reported to have said that the talks should be  maintained. That was a sign that the United States opposed that  idea.    President Clinton thanked Ciller for the support she has  given to resuming the talks on Cyprus and informed her that he  discussed the problem of the Workers Party of Kurdistan with  President Hafiz al-Asad when he met him some time ago.</p>

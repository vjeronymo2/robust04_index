			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: Kingfisher upset Shares in high street retailer Kingfisher fell sharply as rumours circulated of a large derivatives trade, said to have been undertaken by Swiss Bank, and possibly linked to a potentially large sale of Kingfisher shares next month. The possibility of a sale arises because, according to dealers, one third of the 68m Kingfisher shares used last year to purchase Darty, the French electrical retailer, can be sold by the holders from June 3. However, stores analysts said the chances of the French institutions that are among the holders of the shares - which include the company's family and workforce, as well as some institutional investors - all deciding to sell the stock at the same time must be highly unlikely. But the Swiss Bank story unnerved the stock, which ended 17 off at 572p, albeit in modest trade of 2.4m.</p>

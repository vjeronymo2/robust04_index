			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / UK, US to meet on air liberalisation BRITISH and US negotiators will meet early next month in a bid to speed up talks on a new and more liberal air transport treaty. Mr John MacGregor, the British transport secretary, met his US opposite number, Mr Andrew Card, in Washington yesterday, and the two agreed to accelerate the renegotiation of the 15-year old Bermuda II treaty which at present regulates air traffic between the two countries. The issue has been given added urgency by British Airways' proposal to take a 44 per cent equity stake in USAir with a Dollars 750m (Pounds 438m) investment, a proposal which must be approved by Mr Card. Mr MacGregor insisted in Washington yesterday that the issues of cross-border investment and air traffic liberalisation were entirely separate. He pledged that, if the BA/USAir deal were approved, he would 'be disposed to approve' a similar minority investment by a US airline in a UK airline, but declined to tie the deal to freer access to British airports. US air carriers, however, are not enthusiastic at the prospect of buying one of the UK's small carriers; they want the British Airways deal to be linked to removal of restrictions on capacity, gateways and pricing, allowing them much broader opportunities to compete on European routes. 'Failure to require liberalisation of the existing air services agreement with the UK prior to approving a BA investment in USAir would permit an illiberal trading partner to obtain access to the US market without opening its own markets to competition from US carriers,' said Mr Daniel Kasper, director of the transportation practice at Harbridge House, a Boston management consultancy.</p>

			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Union cuts loss to Pounds 16.3m - Boost from money market and Winterflood sale A TURNROUND in its core money market operations and the sale of its equity marketmaking business for Pounds 19m meant that Union Discount, London's oldest specialist discount house group, could survive as an independent company, Mr George Blunden, chief executive, said yesterday. Announcing a pre-tax loss of Pounds 16.3m, an improvement on the Pounds 23.6m loss the year before, Mr Blunden said Union had succeeded in returning to break-even at the operating level in the second half. However, the group is not paying any dividend for the year (13.5p). Talks about a sale of the group had been called off last week because the unnamed potential bidder failed to offer enough for Union's troubled leasing business, Mr Blunden said. The group is now planning to reorganise its remaining leasing operations, selling some parts and running off the remainder. The sale of Union's 90.5 per cent stake in Winterflood Securities, the specialist smaller companies marketmaker, was intended to provide the capital to underpin money market operations, allowing it to expand into more profitable areas of trading such as bond arbitrage. Winterflood made a profit of Pounds 4.42m for the year, reflecting a return of interest in smaller companies. The performance of the group was held back by a loss of about Pounds 3m on the day sterling pulled out of the European exchange rate mechanism in September. Since then the discount house operation had been profitable. Discount house operating losses for the year were Pounds 5.1m, compared with Pounds 2.6m in 1991. After higher provisions over leasing in the first half, Union made no further provisions for the year. Operating losses in asset financing fell from Pounds 16.3m in 1991 to Pounds 7.6m. If Union fails to find a buyer for its leasing assets, it could face extra costs of an estimated Pounds 7m over the next three to four years, said Mr Blunden. Losses per share, at 78.2p, were down from 98.9p. Net assets per share fell from 300.63p to 187.92p, though the sale of Winterflood added a further 32p a share.</p>

			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / Nato faces a Sarajevo dilemma: The setting up of a UN protectorate needs political will as well as firepower WHILE Monday's tentative agreement at the Bosnian peace talks on the future of Sarajevo might have marked a welcome breakthrough for the Geneva mediators, it has left Nato facing another military headache. Few doubt that if the settlement being discussed at Geneva is to have any hope of success, it will require the largest ever deployment of peacekeeping forces in the United Nations' history. But though a speedy deployment will be essential for the policing of any agreement, diplomatic sources yesterday indicated that the key questions of who would provide the troops - let alone actually pay for them - remains far from resolved. Although Nato officials insist that there is still the political will in the alliance to ensure the necessary deployment, the failure to reach an agreement so far remains one of the many 'chicken and egg' dilemmas that could yet derail the peace process. Without a firm military commitment to police a settlement, there seems little likelihood of ending the negotiations. However, after months of broken ceasefires and peace agreements, most western countries argue that they cannot offer more troops until they have a clear agreement. A Nato source in Brussels yesterday said: 'The fact is that without implementation there can be no agreement. President (Alija) Izetbegovic is never going to sign anything until he thinks he knows exactly what protection he will have.' Faced with this situation, Lord Owen, the international mediator, was yesterday at pains to reassure the Moslem delegation that the 3,000 UN protection troops currently in Sarajevo should be enough to make the recent agreement to run the city as a UN protectorate viable. In practice though, UN officials admit that they have little idea what the protectorate would actually entail. They point out that if the peace-keepers are to act as anything more than military observers, they would probably require a force of at least 6,000. Further afield, the figures become even more uncertain. The previous peace settlement drawn up in the spring, which divided Bosnia into 10 semi-autonomous provinces, envisaged a peace-keeping force of around 70,000, of which a third were expected to be US troops. Under the present plan, on the basis that fewer borders would require fewer soldiers, military strategists now believe that some 35,000 to 45,000 troops would be sufficient for the operation, according to some diplomats. Since the UN already has 24,000 ground troops in the former Yugoslavia, of which 10,000 are currently in Bosnia, Nato officials argue these troops could provide the necessary stop-gap solution. But since they are operating under a humanitarian brief, deploying them as peace-keepers would require a new UN resolution - potentially another delaying factor. And with the UN already facing its worst cash crisis in its history - in which the countries contributing peace-keeping troops are already owed some Dollars 360m (Pounds 241.6m)  - it remains unclear where the extra 20,000-plus troops would come from. In the light of Washington's previous refusal to commit any ground troops, the European members of Nato are now hoping that the largest provider will now be the United States. One possibility suggested by a Nato source, was for the US to spearhead the initial peace-keeping force - as in Somalia - before withdrawing after several months to be replaced with a much smaller, more 'traditional' UN peace-keeping force, in which a large proportion of the troops would probably be from non-Nato countries. But with the US government facing strong opposition in Congress against any agreement which would leave it endorsing an ethnic partition of Bosnia, Washington has pointedly refrained in recent days from making watertight commitments on the issue. Countries such as Britain and France, which have so far contributed the largest number of troops to Bosnia, appear reluctant to envisage any broader commitment. Meanwhile, as military experts point out, even if an agreement is reached, the deployment itself is unlikely to be speedy. Colonel Andrew Duncan, of the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London, said: 'Generally it would take at least a month before they could set off. 'You've got to paint the vehicles white, find the blue hats, set up the communication network - all these details take time.'</p>

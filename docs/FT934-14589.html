			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / International Company News: Hitachi to increase spending on advanced memory chips capacity JAPANESE semiconductor makers are stepping up investment in next-generation dynamic random access memory chips in a bid to take advantage of strong demand for advanced memory chips from the personal computer industry and stay ahead of rivals in the highly competitive market. Hitachi yesterday became the latest company to announce it will increase investment in 16-megabit dRAMs to bring worldwide capacity at its dRAM factories to about 2m chips a month by the end of next year. The company produces about 300,000 16-megabit dRAMs a month in Japan, but it plans to start manufacturing the chips at its German plant next year. It will invest Y60bn (Dollars 566m) by the end of fiscal 1996. Hitachi's move follows the earlier decision by NEC to bring a semiconductor facility on stream to manufacture 16-megabit dRAMS next year. NEC's facility, which had been built but not equipped, will eventually have the capacity to manufacture 4m dRAMs per month, the company said. Meanwhile, Fujitsu, one of Japan's leading semiconductor makers, and Hyundai, the Korean company, agreed earlier this month to co-operate in the development of 16-megabit dRAMs. Hitachi also agreed earlier this month to transfer 16-megabit technology to Goldstar of Korea and buy back chips on an original equipment manufacturing basis.</p>

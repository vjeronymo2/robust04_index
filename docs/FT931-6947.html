			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / International Company News: GE Capital in Dollars 500m deal GE CAPITAL, the fast-expand-ing financial services arm of General Electric, is spending some Dollars 500m to buy about half the portfolio of troubled real estate assets put up for sale last September by First Chicago, the mid-western bank. GE Capital is one of the most aggressive buyers of troubled property portfolios in the US market, having avoided serious real estate invest-ment problems of its own during the slump of the late 1980s. First Chicago was one of the first banks to announce the wholesale disposal and write-down of its troubled property loans, which were originally valued at Dollars 2.1bn. It decided that there were no near-term signs of recovery in the US market. The assets being sold to GE Capital had an original book value of about Dollars 1bn and are diverse, both geographically and by collateral type.</p>

			<p><P> April 23, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FAT AND POLITICS FEED DEBATE;  </P> <P> SCHOOL CAFETERIAS FLUNK NUTRITION TEST, CRITICS SAY  </P> <P> The apple sauce had been exonerated, and inside the Los Angeles Unified School  District's food factory, the assembly lines were whipping out 160 lunch trays  per minute, 85,000 meals per day.  </P> <P> Dispensers squirted a rich red goo of strawberries and apple sauce into the  appropriate tray compartments. Workers wearing hair nets placed green salad and  chalupas in other sections. Chalupas, taco shell boats filled with spiced  ground beef and piled with cheese, are preferred because tacos don't travel  well in those little trays.  </P> <P> "Food technology," a school nutritionist explained.  </P> <P> All that cheese, so rich in fat and salt, is one reason some health authorities  say school cafeterias deserve a D-minus for nutrition. School meals, critics  complain, are being corrupted by special-interest politics and fast-food  tastes.  </P> <P> School nutritionists say it's a bum rap -- and, no, ketchup is not a vegetable.  But, indeed, long before the Alar pesticide scare last month prompted many  school districts to stop serving apple products -- a ban lifted after extensive  testing -- debate has raged over school menus laden with items such as pizza,  hot dogs, cheeseburgers and "pork choppettes." At most schools, students can  wash this stuff down with chocolate milk.  </P> <P> The story of school lunch is a saga of the American heartland and the American  schoolyard, of America's diet and America's health, of the American Heart Assn.  and processed American cheese.  </P> <P> A 1987 federal report showed that the sedentary youngsters of today generally  have more weight problems than previous generations. Another study found that  25% of schoolchildren tested had unhealthy cholesterol counts. Are television  and video games the only culprits?  </P> <P> "Our diet is so rich in fats, half of us are going to die from it," said Dr.  William Castelli, a Massachusetts heart researcher who maintains that the  typical school lunch is more suitable for dogs than children. "We need to bring  children into this campaign against cholesterol. When are we going to start?  Shouldn't we help them develop good habits as children?"  </P> <P> </P> <P> Politics Stirred In  </P> <P> Critics complain that school meals are prepped more by Washington politics and  economic policies than by nutritional concerns.  </P> <P> "In order to take care of a few thousand dairymen, they're loading up millions  of little bodies with unnecessary fat," said Carol Tucker Foreman, an assistant  agriculture secretary in the Carter Administration and now a Washington  consultant.  </P> <P> But school nutritionists strongly defend the meals they serve. The school lunch  is nutritionally superior to the typical sack lunch prepared by parents, the  nutritionists say. That was the conclusion of a 1983 study sponsored by the  U.S. Department of Agriculture, which provides a cash reimbursement to most  American schools, as well as about 25% of their foodstuffs in the form of  surplus flour, cheese, grains, meat, fruits and vegetables.  </P> <P> This massive food distribution program reaches more than 24.2 million students.  The smaller school breakfast program, targeted to low-income neighborhoods,  serves 3.7 million students.  </P> <P> For some schoolchildren, the question is not one of a high-fiber, low-fat diet,  but of food itself. Some players in the food debate believe the federal  government should do more to expand food programs in poor neighborhoods, where  they can be the primary source of nutrition, according to Lynn Parker of the  Food Research and Action Center in Washington.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Quality Praised  </P> <P> The quality of government surplus foods, such as ground beef that would qualify  as lean at a supermarket, is "excellent," said Maria Balakshin, nutrition  director for the California Department of Education. These foods are often  funneled to processors who make prefab items such as pizza and burritos to  school specifications.  </P> <P> Think of the job of cafeteria managers as mass parenting. Like parents, they  can't just shove tuna, fresh vegetables and nonfat milk down the kids' throats.  So they try to serve meals that, first, will be eaten and, second, will be  nutritious.  </P> <P> Shyrl Dougherty, food service director of the Montebello Unified School  District and immediate past president of the California Food Service Assn.,  said nutritionists have worked in recent years to reduce the fat, salt and  sugar in their meals, while increasing fiber.  </P> <P> In many California schools, french fries now are baked instead of deep-fried,  lowering the fat content. Hot dogs made of turkey are often served for the same  reason. Some districts use computers to monitor fat content in their meals, and  some secondary schools offer salad bars. In 1987, Los Angeles Unified  implemented a plan with such aims as increasing the consumption of wheat bread  over white, decreasing the consumption of chocolate milk and promoting the use  of fresh fruits and vegetables.  </P> <P> Balakshin suggested that she is more concerned about the Alar scare than the  chemical itself. Children "may be alarmed, (thinking) that it's not good for  them to eat apples," she said. "But that's not true. It's very good for them to  eat apples."  </P> <P> Practices vary greatly from school to school and region to region. Authorities  who have a national perspective say schools in health-conscious California  generally have taken the lead in pushing for better nutritional standards.  </P> <P> School officials find themselves operating in a gray area. The National Academy  of Science has recommended dietary guidelines in which fat makes up no more  than 30% of an adult's caloric intake, but there is still considerable  disagreement over what levels are appropriate for children.  </P> <P> "We've asked (the federal government) and the scientific community to put  together a set of dietary guidelines that apply specifically to children.  Amazingly, there is none," said Kevin Dando, a spokesman for the American  School Food Service Assn.  </P> <P> Still, many health authorities are perplexed that USDA school lunch nutrition  standards have not changed since 1946, when Congress mandated the program. The  standards call for a daily requirement of a half-pint of milk, two ounces of  protein and three-quarter-cup servings of two or more vegetables or fruits, as  well as eight servings of bread, grain or pasta per week.  </P> <P> Foreman cites an example of special-interest food politics: As an official in  the Carter Administration, she and many nutritionists advocated that schools  shift from whole milk to low-fat milk. Over time, many schools did just that.  </P> <P> But in 1986, Rep. Steve Gunderson (R-Wis.) pushed through a bill requiring  schools to offer whole milk as well -- a move many nutritionists considered a  step backward. USDA spokeswoman Maria Falcone said the agency is sometimes  unfairly blamed for actions "by congressmen from states with a lot of cows."  </P> <P> Dairy farmers liked Gunderson's bill because it encouraged not merely the  consumption of milk, but milk fat. A dairy farmer whose cows produce a higher  percentage of milk fat gets a higher price from processors because the fat can  be used for solid products such as cheese, butter, sour cream and ice cream.  Because there is a surplus of milk fat, they still want to sell all the whole  milk they can.  </P> <P> Judy Ziewacz, a lobbyist for the National Milk Producers Federation, says the  debate over whole milk versus low-fat milk has been blown out proportion -- a  difference of three grams of fat in a half-pint serving. (According to Los  Angeles school nutritionists, the difference is four grams.)  </P> <P> </P> <P> A Little Frustrated  </P> <P> Health crusaders have gone overboard, Ziewacz said. The American Heart Assn.  has sent letters to congressmen that "make us sound like we're drug pushers,"  she said. "Like we're standing outside the playground -- 'Here, kid, eat cheese  and die.' If you're a dairy farmer, you get a little frustrated with people  telling you how milk isn't good for you."  </P> <P> Another striking example of how agriculture policy influences school menus is  the Dairy Termination Act of 1985. Enacted to curb the over-productive dairy  industry, the law led to the slaughtering of 1.6 million cows to reduce the  nation's dairy herds.  </P> <P> The next year, schools were serving more hamburgers. Or probably cheeseburgers,  because there was still plenty of cheese left.  </P> <P> Now, the law is finally withering the mountainous surplus of processed American  and Cheddar cheeses that piled up in the 1980s. (Butter is still given free to  schools -- a fact that rankles both nutrition crusaders and margarine makers.)  </P> <P> The cheese surplus was so great that the Reagan Administration in the early  1980s literally gave it away, handing out truckloads in the nation's ghettos.  Some of that cheese, for better or worse, also found its way into school  cafeterias.  </P> <P> </P> <P> School Lunch Act  </P> <P> In fact, America's dairy policy and the school lunch have been entwined for  decades. The lessons of World War II persuaded Congress to pass the National  School Lunch Act in 1946 "to safeguard the health and well-being of the  nation's children." The meals that are now widely regarded as a social program  were advocated by military generals concerned that thousands of draftees had  been rejected because of nutrition-related health problems.  </P> <P> The Reagan Administration, however, saw it as a bloated social program. Funding  was cut by $1 billion, effectively slashing per-meal federal reimbursement  rates. The budget-cutting finally caused an outcry when officials tried to  reclassify ketchup and relish as vegetables and cookies as bread. Still unable  to make ends meet, more than 2,000 schools stopped serving lunch to 2 million  children, according to the Food Research and Action Center.  </P> <P> For many school cafeterias facing tight economic times, the solution was  cheese.  </P> <P> The USDA had so much it decided the schools could have all they could eat,  free. Normally, the department would allot a quota per district. For schools,  the beauty of cheese was not merely its price, but the fact that it fulfills  the meal's protein requirements. Like a family on a tight budget, schools  started serving more macaroni and cheese and less beef and chicken.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Spoiled by Cheese  </P> <P> Now that the supply is running low, some fear another financial crisis. "This  went on for such a long period of time that schools . . . started thinking of  it as an integral part of their financing," Anita Cashman, a food services  director in Utica, Mich., told the journal Education Week.  </P> <P> Anita King, Los Angeles Unified's nutrition services manager, paused a moment  when asked whether the cheese limits are good news or bad news. Used  judiciously, she said, the virtues of cheese's protein, calcium, vitamins and  taste outweigh the evil of its fat and salt.  </P> <P> "All these things where people say something's good for you or something's bad  for you -- well, you have to look at the whole picture," King said.  </P> <P> Sitting in her office at the district's Newman Nutrition Center in Boyle  Heights, King spoke confidently of the meals being assembled on the factory  floors below. More than anything else, the pervasive influence of the fast-food  industry has changed the school lunch in recent years, she said. The Los  Angeles district serves about 1 million burritos a month -- burritos, she  hastens to add, that are nutritionally superior to those found in markets or  taco joints because they are made to district specifications.  </P> <P> In all, the Newman food factory makes 25,000 breakfasts and 60,000 lunches per  day. They are trucked to scores of schools that lack full kitchen facilities.  Even so, they represent but a fraction of Los Angeles Unified's massive  operation, which serves 550,000 meals per day.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Minding the Store  </P> <P> At the Fletcher Drive Elementary School in the Glassell Park area, cafeteria  manager Sigrid Sapone and her staff serve about 350 breakfasts and 650 lunches  daily. It's not a wealthy neighborhood and school officials say a child  sometimes may try to buy five cartons of milk at the subsidized price and sneak  four home to mom. This violates the law.  </P> <P> "They're very serious about that. . . . You have to be an old Scrooge  sometimes," Principal Chris Christianson said with a sigh.  </P> <P> When it comes to school lunches, principals have a lot of clout, and  Christianson has his own set of rules. Chocolate milk, for example, is  forbidden. The school district allows it as kind of a sweet bribe to get  children the nutrients milk provides. But Christianson believes it "makes them  hyper" and he is annoyed "by this thing where we have to cater to everybody's  whims."  </P> <P> Another rule of his: No raisins.  </P> <P> "They don't eat them," Christianson explained. "They throw them. They get on  the ground, you step on them and they get squished into the pavement. The  custodian hates them."  </P></p>

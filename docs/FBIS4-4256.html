			<p>BFN     [Text] Shandong Province has planned to devote three to  five years to cultivate and develop 16 competitive brand name  industrial products through technological transformation. This  is one of the important strategic moves for readjusting  Shandong's industrial product mix determined by the provincial  technological transformation leading group.    The 16 competitive products to be developed on a priority  basis are motorcycles, vehicle parts, engineering machinery,  microcomputers, telecommunications equipment, household electric  appliances, garments, beverage, ceramics, numerical-controlled  machine tools, electric cables, communications electric cables,  medicines, radial tires, elevators, ships for special use, and  petrochemical products.    It is planned that 9.3 billion yuan will be invested in the  technological transformation projects for cultivating and  developing competitive products and that over 60 enterprises  will undertake these projects. Upon completion, these projects  may form a production capacity of 1 million motorcycles, spare  parts for 300,000 cars, 10,000 engineering machines, 100,000  microcomputers, 200,000 fax machines, 1.5 million shirts, 3,000  numerical-controlled machine tools and some processing centers,  and 20,000 sanitary wares. By that time, the largest  antibiotics and febrifuge producing enterprise, the largest  engineering machinery group, and the largest brewery and  sanitary ceramic wares manufacturing plant of China will emerge  in the vast land of Shandong. Because the production capacity  of these products are mainly concentrated on key enterprises,  the annual sales income of 15 enterprises producing these  products will exceed 1 billion yuan and 11 will reach 500  million yuan.    In order to successfully carry out the technological  transformation items of these 16 competitive products, the  provincial authorities have decided to attach prime importance  to arranging for the development of technological items of  competitive products while determining the province's 100 key  transformation projects every year, give priority to making  investments in this aspect, and regard some supporting projects  as the major items of various cities and prefectures. At  present, the relevant provincial departments are stepping up  their efforts to formulate implementation plans and supporting  preferential policies for developing competitive products.  Thirty-eight items have been arranged in the province's 100  major technological transformation projects, and have been  initiated.</p>

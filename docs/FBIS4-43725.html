			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Peter Ziller: "To the Pinnacles of Wealth"] </F>   [Text] Next weekend, the Alliance 90/Greens want to  sharpen their profile as a reform party that is also able to  participate in the government at the federal level. At a  meeting of the Land Council -- the highest body that meets  between the federal delegates' assemblies -- they want to  discuss 10 "turning points" in Magdeburg. With these they will  enter the election campaign and, later on, perhaps the coalition  talks. FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU correspondent Peter Ziller talked  about the touchstones with Ludger Volmer, one of the two  Executive Committee spokesmen of the Greens.    Volmer has had a few pleasant days. The "unexpectedly good"  result of the European election was followed by an appearance at  the DGB [German Trade Union Federation] federal congress, where  the 42-year-old man felt "unconcealed sympathetic feelings"  coming from the delegates. For the sociologist, who is  considered a member of the left wing, the Greens are now the  third political force.    The turning points suggested by the Executive Committee do  not mean a correction of the Mannheim election congress. No  wing of the party wants that, Volmer says, rejecting the  suspicion that is emerging here and there. What was decided at  the end of February must, however be "explained and detailed" in  some fields. Thus, the demands often have a different time  scale. In Magdeburg, the Greens now want to make clear what  kind of "change in direction" they consider feasible and  indispensable within one legislative period.    In Volmer's view, not only some media but also the desired  political partner, the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD],  have misunderstood the Greens' decisions. "In contrast to the  widespread rumors, our goal is not the immediate abolition of  the Bundeswehr and departure from NATO." He says that the  Greens rather want a "diplomatic initiative for the dissolution  of the military blocs in a system of collective security." This  cannot be achieved by a one-sided act, which has been agreed on  in a coalition agreement. "After all, we know that our remote  foreign policy goals can be only the result of years of  diplomacy." In the turning points, his party describes what is  possible soon: for instance, the strong reduction of the  military service, the renunciation of German crisis intervention  forces, and new projects for the acquisition of armament goods.    However, the Greens are putting other issues in the  foreground. The first four turning points are aimed at the  ecological restructuring of the economy, the lack of jobs, the  situation in the new laender, and social policy. "We need a  courageous reform policy -- and reforms are expensive."  Therefore his party says that new sources of money must be  opened up. Rudolf Scharping's "safety-fence concept," which  rejects higher taxes and debts and says that reforms are carried  out only if it is possible to finance them, extends the "policy  of muddling through," in the view of the Greens leader. "There  is a great deal of money in Germany," Volmer says. He includes  the high private capital incomes, the high liquidity of the  companies, and inherited assets. "We want to get to the  pinnacles of wealth"; the broad population benefits from  tax-free amounts and is not burdened additionally.    However, the consumers are not spared ecological taxes. The  higher petroleum tax, for instance, which is to rise by 30  pfennigs per year, will not be generally compensated for by the  reduction of other taxes, Volmer affirms. The increase is to  make the consumers buy energy-saving products and to change the  structure of industry's range of products.</p>

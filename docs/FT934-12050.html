			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Premium for BSM on first day Shares in BSM Group closed at 174p on their first day of trading yesterday - 4p above the flotation price. The group, which owns the British School of Motoring, raised a net Pounds 32.1m from the issue of 19.83m ordinary shares. Half were placed, and half offered through intermediaries. Mr Paul Massey, chief executive, said earlier this month that the flotation would clear the debts incurred in the management buy-out of 1990 and leave the company ungeared. The company wants to expand to take advantage of what it perceives as pent up demand for driving lessons after three years of recession.</p>

			<p><P> December 10, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> WILLIS SLAMS THE TABLOIDS  </P> <P> Bruce Willis says he thinks about suing the supermarket tabloids every day.  </P> <P> "What more could they do to me?" he asks in an interview in the January edition  of Vanity Fair.  </P> <P> Willis says tabloids have printed things he said in jest as fact and made up  stories, like one about his saving an actress on a runaway horse.  </P> <P> "In that movie, there were no horses," Willis said. "People say, 'Why do you  care? It makes you look so good.' But if they can print that lie, they can just  as easily print that I had sex with a goat. A lie is a lie."  </P> <P> Given his feelings about tabloid reporters, Willis was asked why he agreed to  play a tabloid reporter in his newest film, "The Bonfire of the Vanities" -- a  character who is a ruthless, boozy scavenger of stories.  </P> <P> "That's why," he replied.  </P></p>

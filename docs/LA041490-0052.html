			<p><P> April 14, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: VENTURA;  </P> <P> STREET SIGNS FADING FROM GREEN TO BLUE  </P> <P> The city of Ventura is slowly but surely replacing green street signs at major  intersections with blue ones designed for easier reading.  </P> <P> The project has been going on for the past two years and, according to  Maintenance Services Supervisor John Betonte, night drivers should note a  visible difference.  </P> <P> "The new high-intensity signs are brighter and easier to read than the older  engineering-grade signs we used to use," Betonte said.  </P> <P> In addition to being easier to read, Betonte said, the new signs will be  directly bolted to traffic-light structures. This will prevent the new signs  from swaying in high winds.  </P> <P> With the exception of Wells Road, the city is responsible for all signs beyond  the curbside of freeway ramps.  </P> <P> The silk-screened wood street signs in downtown Ventura will not be replaced  with the new blue signs. Smaller street markers, those on poles and not  attached to traffic lights, will also remain unchanged. RUSS CHARVONIA  </P></p>

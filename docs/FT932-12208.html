			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / Investors write off holdings in Accountancy Television INVESTORS representing 40 per cent of the shares in Accountancy Television, the late-night BBC weekly subscription programme produced by and for accountants, have written off their holdings. The Chartered Association of Certified Accountants states in its 1992 annual report, released yesterday, that it has written off its entire Pounds 250,000 stake. Earlier this year, BPP Holdings, a financial training company which holds shares worth Pounds 350,000, took similar action. Mr David Bishop, president of the certified accountants, said his organisation's policy was always to write off educational projects of this sort, although the accounts do not make that statement. BPP's write-off reflected what the company called 'a high-risk venture whose future must be regarded as uncertain during this early critical period'. Accountancy TV, which is broadcast by BBC Select, the late-night subscription service, began broadcasting in October and has run into several setbacks. Mr Mike Lickiss, chairman of the company and a senior partner in Grant Thornton, the accountancy firm, confirmed that the service was Pounds 300,000 behind projections. He said he was still confident about the company but it would not make profits until the end of 1994, at least six months beyond last year's projections. The other main BBC Select services for people in business and lawyers seem to be going considerably better. Mr Peter Brindley, chief executive of Legal Network Television, launched in February, said last night: 'We are ahead of target. We have had a very good launch.' The company, whose shareholders are the College of Law, BBC Select and the Law Society, broadcasts two half-hour programmes a week. Mr Roy Bass, marketing director of the Executive Business Club, which launched 10 months ago, said the service had taken Pounds 1.5m in subscriptions and was on target. Mr John Radcliffe, managing director of BBC Select, said he was happy with progress but conceded that recession had made it more difficult to raise money for new services. Total shareholdings in Accountancy TV are Pounds 1.5m. The other investors are BBC Select, the three chartered accountancy bodies covering the UK and Ireland, and the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants. There were initial differences between the five professional accountancy bodies over the level of coverage provided to each of them. Difficulties with the broadcast technology meant the company had to distribute some of its early programmes by videotape. In spite of initial optimistic projections that the company had attracted interest from 11,000 potential subscribers, only a few more than 600 have signed up. Depsite market research which suggested the main audience was industry and commerce the programmes were initially geared at least as much towards accountants in practice. The actual take-up proved, as predicted, to be mainly from business, and Accountancy TV has had to modify its programmes to reflect that.</p>

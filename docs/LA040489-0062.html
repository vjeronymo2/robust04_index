			<p><P> April 4, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> HEARING ON ASSAULT GUN BAN DELAYED  </P> <P> A federal judge delayed a hearing on a lawsuit challenging Los Angeles' ban on  military-style assault weapons.  </P> <P> Two Los Angeles gun owners and the operator of a Culver City gun store filed  the lawsuit in March and sought an injunction Monday that would have prevented  enforcement of the ordinance approved by the City Council on Feb. 7.  </P> <P> U.S. District Judge Terry J. Hatter said he could not rule on the matter,  however, because the same issue is pending before a state Court of Appeal in  San Francisco. He told the parties to return for a hearing June 26.  </P> <P> The gun owners' suit alleges that the city ordinance violates their  constitutional right to bear arms and runs counter to federal laws allowing  interstate transportation of firearms.  </P></p>

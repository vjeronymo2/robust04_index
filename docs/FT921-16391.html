			<p>920103 FT  03 JAN 92 / Money Markets: Base rate fears fade THE MONEY markets took a breather yesterday as fears over an interest rate rise began to fade. Sterling's stronger showing from the early hours gave some reassurance that the UK government would be able to avoid a rate rise for the time being. However, with most of the market still on new year holiday, dealers were cautious about too much optimism. 'Everyone is waiting for something,' commented one senior trader. 'The whole picture is one of calm before next week's storm.' Many dealers attributed sterling's rally, not just to encouraging noises from Downing Street, but also to a scramble to cover short positions. The Bank of England gave an early and clear signal that it anticipated no rise in rates when before noon it injected Pounds 265m to cover a forecast Pounds 550m shortage. The assistance was high, given the uncommonly low shortage. During the day, the Bank revised its forecast to Pounds 650m, and provided a total of Pounds 504m in bands 1,3 and 4 bank and treasury bills - all at the lower end of market rates. The bank's actions helped to keep overnight money soft, and it traded around the 10 per cent mark during most of the day. The market was forecasting a shortage for tomorrow of Pounds 950m. The Bank's actions - along with statements from its governor, Mr Robin Leigh Pemberton, that there would be no need for an interest rate rise - appeared to give some heart to short sterling contracts. The March futures contract surprised the market by rising to 89.40, implying an interest rate of 10.6 per cent. Yet most dealers - although feeling slightly comforted by the government's determin-ation to keep rates steady, at the very least - are still expecting a rate rise in the medium term. The key three months inter-bank rate eased slightly, although at 10 7/8 - 3/4 per cent it still indicated a  1/2 point rise early this year. In the US, traders were talking of pressure for a further rate cut as the latest economic figures gave little indication of an upturn. Jobless claims, although better than expected, were still too high, economists said. Federal Funds traded at around 4 7/16 per cent, above the Federal Reserve's presumed target of 4 per cent. Year-end pressures had forced the funds rate upwards, dealers said.</p>

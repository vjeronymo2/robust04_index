The fund will be exhausted this month. The unions  are threatening to resign from the administration of the fund if  conditions worsen for the unemployed.    Torshavn -- The Faeroes' depleted unemployment fund must be  rescued by a new multimillion-kroner loan.    This decision, reached by a committee set up in the Faeroes,  could mean that within the next few days the Faeroese government  will apply to the Danish Government for permission to take out a  loan of between 40 and 50 million kroner for the purpose of  supporting unemployed local inhabitants.    There are so many jobless people in the Faeroes that the  unemployment fund pays out far more money in support than it  receives. In February the fund will once more be exhausted.    The committee, made up of members of the Faeroes' coalition  government parties, decided to recommend leaving the  unemployment payment rules as they are and offsetting the  shortfall by taking out a loan of between 40 and 50 million  kroner. That should be enough to support the jobless in the  Faeroes for the rest of the year. This assumes that the  unemployed will continue to be allowed to remain enrolled in the  fund for 24 months instead of cutting the enrollment period to  15 months, as some have proposed.    Johannes Eidesgaard, the Faeroes' government member  responsible for social and labor issues, said that he intends to  start by applying to the local banks and savings institutions  because they should assume their share of the responsibility for  the jobless in the Faeroes. However, if the Lagting [Faeroese  parliament] must also guarantee the loan, it will be necessary  for both the Lagting and the Danish Government to give their  approval.    In connection with the loan agreements that Denmark and the  Faeroes have reached, the Danish Government has stipulated not  only that the accounts of the Faeroes' unemployment fund must be  balanced, but also that the unemployment system must not be  provided with money via the Faeroese budget. This requirement is  one of the reasons why the unions in the Faeroes have proposed  that local labor market issues be made a joint national affair  so that Denmark has a responsibility to ensure that the  unemployed in the Faeroes have the same conditions as Danes who  are out of work.    The trade unions in the Faeroes have threatened to resign  from the administration of the unemployment fund if conditions  deteriorate for unemployed people there.</p>

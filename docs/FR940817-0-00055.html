			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 287.8(f)_Site Inspections <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The commenters stated that this section was legally insufficient and should provide more detailed requirements concerning the obtaining of warrants and consent for site inspections, the determination of ``exigent circumstances,'' and standards and procedures for detention. Commenters specifically suggested that the rule incorporate judicial precedent based on the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution concerning the issuance of warrants, the obtaining of consent to enter a premises, and the detention of persons subject to questioning; that officers engaged in site inspections be trained in standards of enforcement and procedure pertaining to site inspections; that Service officers not deliberately provoke flight by persons in order to justify entry onto a premises; and that Service officers avoid ``unnecessary embarrassment'' of persons subject to site inspections, as well as verbal abuse, psychological abuse, threats, and unnecessary physical force. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Service agrees with the substance of most of the suggestions made by the commenters, but has not incorporated these suggestions into the final rule. For the reasons stated previously, the Department does not consider it appropriate to incorporate evolving judicial precedent into regulations. Such precedents are included in Service training programs, guidelines, and enforcement manuals. In addition, many of the procedural suggestions made by these commenters either are included in current Service training programs, guidelines, and enforcement manuals or will be considered for inclusion in these materials. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department has also revised the ordering of the paragraphs within this section and has revised the text of paragraph (2) in the proposed rule, now designated as paragraph (4). The purpose of these changes is to clarify that the conditions set forth in this section for the conduct of site inspections do not restrict the authority of Service officers to enter into any area of a business or other activity to which the general public has access or onto open fields that are not farm or other outdoor agricultural operations without a warrant, consent, or any particularized suspicion. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Sections 287.5(f), 298.8(a) and 287.9_Use of Force and Firearms <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The commenters criticized these provisions of the proposed rule on a number of grounds. The commenters stated that the rule failed to address the 27 recommendations presented in the Audit Report, ``Immigration and Naturalization Service Firearms Policy, September 1991,'' prepared by the Department's Office of the Inspector General, Audit Division. The commenters asserted that the rule's statement that standards on the use of force are based on a force continuum model taught at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center is inadequate and that the rule should adopt the recommendations of standards for law enforcement agencies developed by the Commission on Accreditation of Law Enforcement Agencies. The commenters also stated that the rule was too narrow in its statement of the authority to carry firearms; the commenters recommended that the rule adopt guidelines that reflect the ``multiple psychological dimensions'' that might influence an officer's behavior. The commenters also urged that the rule incorporate a statement of 15 Shooting Reduction Techniques published in 1985 by the American Bar Foundation. The commenters stated that the principle of proportionality must be specifically set forth in the rule's guidelines on the use of force along with more specific guidelines on the use of force in specific situations that immigration officers are likely to encounter. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Service agrees that many of the recommendations made by the commenters are sound and should be incorporated into the training of immigration officers. In fact, a significant portion of the Service firearms training program is devoted to judgment shooting that includes providing specific scenarios that immigration officers are likely to face. However, as a matter of Departmental policy, it is not appropriate to incorporate such detailed guidelines for law enforcement activities into administrative rulemaking. Most of the recommendations made by the Inspector General in the Audit Report have been, or are in the process of being, adopted or implemented by the Service. The commenters noted that, in a letter dated August 7, 1991, the Commissioner stated that the issues raised by the Audit Report would be addressed in the process of drafting these regulations. The recommendations of the Audit Report have been taken into account in the formulation of this rule. Given the increased training that has been and is being developed, no specific response to these recommendations is provided in the regulatory text. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several of the commenters criticized the designation of certain Service officers to carry firearms. The Service disagrees with the suggestion that there is no justification for immigration inspectors or deportation officers to carry firearms; this authority is consistent with Department policy in the implementation of other criminal law enforcement authorities. Such authority is commensurate with the responsibility of such officers to exercise general arrest and control authority at frequent points of contact with potential criminal offenders. These officers have also been authorized to carry firearms for many years. The same commenters criticized the rule's delegation to the Commissioner of authority to designate certain other immigration officers to carry firearms, and stated that any such designations must be the subject of proposed rulemaking in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). Neither section 503 of IMMACT nor the APA requires such discretionary grants of law enforcement authority, made within general guidelines set forth in regulations, to be the subject of rulemaking. Withdrawing the authority to make such designations would constitute an unwarranted burden on effective law enforcement. Moreover, the Commissioner's action is subject to approval by the Deputy Attorney General because the authority to carry a firearm is a traditional criminal law enforcement authority, not an authority intrinsic to the Service. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

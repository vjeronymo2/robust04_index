			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / Albion wins Perkins contract Albion Automotive, created by a management buy-in to take over the UK components operations of failed truckmaker DAF, is to manufacture crankshafts for Perkins Group, one of the world's biggest engine producers. The deal is expected to create about 50 jobs at Albion's plant at Leyland, Lancashire, where last November's buy-in saved 310 jobs as well as 430 at the Albion axle plant at Scotstoun, Glasgow. The 30,000 crankshafts a year to be supplied to Perkins compares with the 18,000 the Leyland plant makes annually for its three core customers - DAF Trucks of the Netherlands and the UK's Leyland Trucks and van maker LDV.</p>

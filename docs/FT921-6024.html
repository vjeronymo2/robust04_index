			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: BES wizards find cunning new routes TAX SHELTERS have reached new levels of fiendish cunning just in time for the Budget. Business expansion scheme financiers have worked out a route to limit the 'downside' - and even go some of the way to ensuring an 'upside' - on trading companies. Until the end of last week, this had been done only with companies holding rented property. Last week saw the first such launch: Friendly Stop Inns sponsored by MMI. This week has brought not the last resort but the Johnson Fry Resort, which will buy hotels for Resort Hotels; and BESSA Cash Backed, sponsored by Close Brothers, which will buy standby safety vessels for Sunset Shipping, a North Sea service company. The schemes use different routes in their attempts to assure an exit. Close Brothers' scheme is backed by a deposit held by Sunset Shipping in an offshore account. If Sunset were to go into liquidation, the sponsors are confident that BES investors would, at the end of five years, receive the covenanted Pounds 1.32 for every Pounds 1 spent now. The Johnson Fry scheme guarantees that, after five years, investors will receive as many shares in Resort Hotels as could have been bought now with the money invested. This allows the possibility of significant upside. There are some safeguards to guard against the shares falling badly over the five years, or Resort Hotels being taken over. This week's more conventional offerings include Sun Life Besres VIII Campus, which will go hunting for universities and housing associations interested in entering into a 'buy-back' deal; and University of Surrey Residences, sponsored by Downing Corporate Finance, which has a buy-back guarantee of Pounds 1.35 after five years for every pre-tax Pounds 1 paid now. More speculative offers include Wig and Pen, which will raise funds for the Wig and Pen Club, a members' licensed dining club in The Strand, London. PiP (Europe), a Hove-based company, is seeking funds for its interim management practice, which provides managers to perform tasks while companies are looking for new executives. A number of the more attractive offers have sold out and Anthony Yadgaroff, of the Allenbridge Group, suggests people take extra care when choosing a scheme. The end of the tax year is close but decisions should not be rushed.</p>

EPA is proposing approval of New Jersey's vehicle miles travelled forecast, carbon monoxide emission inventory, oxygenated fuels rule, and multi-state coordination. EPA is also proposing approval of the employee commute option and transportation control measures as contingency measures. In addition, EPA is proposing a limited approval and a limited disapproval of New Jersey's new source review regulation which covers all nonattainment pollutants. EPA proposes to disapprove New Jersey's November 15, 1993, proposal for an enhanced inspection and maintenance program. In addition, the attainment demonstration is also being disapproved since it relies on the enhanced inspection and maintenance program as a control measure. These revisions have been submitted in response to requirements established in the Clean Air Act as amended in 1990. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments must be received on or before December 12, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Written comments should be addressed to: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> William J.

These requirements are: an attainment demonstration, an enhanced vehicle inspection and maintenance program, an oxygenated fuels rule, a vehicle miles travelled forecast, contingency measures, a carbon monoxide emission inventory, a revised New Source Review program, and multi-state coordination. In addition, a conformity plan is required to be submitted by November 25, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On November 15, 1992, New Jersey submitted to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed revisions to its carbon monoxide SIP that addressed each of the above requirements for its two moderate carbon monoxide nonattainment areas. In addition, in a submittal dated October 4, 1993, New Jersey submitted to EPA information on TCMs which New Jersey will use as a contingency measure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The New Jersey portion of the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island carbon monoxide nonattainment area is classified as a moderate 2 area (an area that has a design value of 12.8&hyph;16.4 ppm.), while the other area, Camden County, is classified as a moderate 1 area (an area with a design value of 9.1&hyph;12.7 ppm). The New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island carbon monoxide nonattainment area is part of the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Area and includes the Counties of Bergen, Essex, Hudson, Union, and parts of Passaic. The nonattainment area in Passaic County includes the Cities of Clifton, Paterson, and Passaic. The remainder of the State is either in attainment or is not classified.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA has issued a ``General Preamble'' describing its preliminary views on how it intends to review SIPs and SIP revisions submitted in order to meet title I requirements (see generally 57 FR 13498 (April 16, 1992) and 57 FR 18070 (April 28, 1992)). The reader should refer to the General Preamble for a more detailed discussion of the title I requirements and what EPA views as necessary to adequately comply with title I provisions. The following summarizes EPA's evaluation of New Jersey's SIP submittals and EPA's proposed actions. The details of EPA's review of New Jersey's submittals are contained in the Technical Support Document available at EPA's Region II office.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Attainment Demonstration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Section 187(a)(7) of the Act requires each state that contains all or part of a moderate 2 area to submit to the Administrator an attainment demonstration by November 15, 1992. This attainment demonstration should document how the State will attain the 8-hour carbon monoxide National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) of 9 ppm by December 31, 1995.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

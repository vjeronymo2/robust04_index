			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / Observer: Stage floor The dealing room at Smith New Court has always prided itself on being the slickest - and the most cut-throat - in the City, rarely giving an inch, let alone a pound of flesh. So RSC director David Thacker, toying with the idea of setting the Barbican Theatre's planned production of The Merchant of Venice in modern dress in the City, deputed designer Sheelagh Keegan to check it out. Her task was to see if the Square Mile really is a good substitute for the Rialto. Even though obviously enthralled as she photographed away with shouting dealers seething around her, she envisages difficulties in translating the characters to fit the present-day City. One problem is how to treat Shylock's Jewishness, although she stresses that he is by no means an unsympathetic character. 'This is a play about racism, not antisemitism.' A further misgiving is that she sees him as 'more of a banker than a dealer'. On the credit side, the shipowner Antonio could surely be converted into the man from Lloyd's. What's more, a lot of the ladies who cater for executive diners nowadays seem to be called Portia (even if they don't necessarily drive one - Ed.).</p>

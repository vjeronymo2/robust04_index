			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / International Company News: ABB takes stake in Chinese power equipment maker Asea Brown Boveri (ABB), the Swiss-Swedish power group, has taken a 4.5 per cent stake in Harbin Power Equipment Company, a former China state-owned enterprise which is in the process of listing in Hong Kong. ABB is buying 21.6m shares at HKDollars 2.58 each, for a total of HKDollars 55.73m (USDollars 7.2m). The pricing puts the stock on a price/earnings multiple of 12.15 times 1995 earnings, according to SG Warburg Securities (Far East), lead manager of the offering. In total, Harbin is raising HKDollars 1.24bn by selling off 40 per cent of its enlarged capital. Of the 480m shares issued, 408m shares are being placed privately and the remainder will be sold to the public in Hong Kong. Although a relative latecomer to the China market, ABB has been aggressively gearing up its mainland expansion plans in the past two years and is shifting its regional headquarters to Beijing from Hong Kong. The Chinese government's reluctance to see a pillar industry like power fall into the hands of foreign companies has made it tougher for such companies to build China operations than, for example, their consumer goods peers. Harbin Power Equipment, the biggest manufacturer of power generating sets in China, is expected to receive a relatively warm reception when trading starts on December 19. Compared with the recently-listed Dongfang Electrical, which also makes generators, Harbin scores a premium on both technology and production. It is also cheaper, with Dongfang trading on a p/e of 14 times. However, Harbin comes to market at a time when sentiment is poor and the power sector remains clouded by uncertainties over the level of return foreigners will be able to achieve.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Dutch </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Wio Joustra: "Risk Battalion in Bosnia </F> Acceptable"]    [Text] Just over one-half of Netherlanders consider the  risks run by Dutch soldiers in the former Yugoslavia to be  acceptable. One in three Netherlanders find them unacceptable.  According to an opinion poll conducted by the NIPO [Netherlands  Institute for Public Opinion] and commissioned by the SMK  [Foundation for Society and the Armed Forces], the figures are  57 and 29 percent respectively.    The representative sample on which the figures are based was  interviewed on 20 and 21 December 1993, at a time when there was  still uncertainty regarding the dispatch of some 1,200  Netherlander ground troops to eastern Bosnia. There are now  around 2,000 netherlander troops in the former Yugoslavia.    Since the end of December, both the likelihood of sending  out  the reinforced light mobile battalion and of NATO air strikes in  the area where Netherlander troops are stationed has increased.  According to Defense Minister Ter Beek, if necessary the  battalion will take "robust" action in order to fulfill its dual  humanitarian mission -- to protect the Muslim population and  humanitarian aid convoys. As many as 70 percent of  Netherlanders are strongly in favor of using force if necessary  in order to get this aid through -- even if this does increase  the risk to Dutch soldiers.    At the same time, the Dutch are also becoming increasingly  pessimistic regarding the likelihood of a lasting peace in the  former Yugoslavia. At the end of 1991, half of public opinion  no longer believed in a negotiated peace. One year later this  figure had increased to 66 percent, and last month the figure  had risen to 84 percent.    The SMK adds that, in an opinion poll, every vigorous  proposal to do something about the war in Bosnia and the  suffering of the civilians is welcomed, even if they involve  greater dangers for their own soldiers. But as soon as these  risks are separately scrutinized, the majority in favor  decreases. Questions which make specific reference to possible  dead and wounded apparently meet with just a minority in favor  of the use of force which involves risks.    The high percentage of people who are pessimistic regarding  peace in the former Yugoslavia does not really come as a  surprise. There is in fact no optimism regarding any of the  world's troublespots. Of particular note is the somber appraisal  of the prospects for peace in the (former) Soviet Union: 64  percent are pessimistic and 13 percent optimistic. The  electoral success of the far-right nationalist Zhirinovskiy has  "certainly not reduced" these figures.    Two out of three Netherlanders believe that Poland, the  Czech  Republic, and Hungary should be able to join NATO. The picture  of an unsafe world is confirmed by the fact that 54 percent of  the population believe that the number of armed conflicts will  increase in the near future.    Against this background, the SMK does not find it strange  that 74 percent -- a level not recorded since the end of the  Cold War -- of people believe there is a need for the armed  forces.    At 72 percent, participation in UN missions in general  receives virtually the same level of support. This does not  detract from the fact that the defense of one's own and allied  territories is seen by most people (40 percent) as the most  important task of the armed forces. Humanitarian aid is seen to  be the most important by 35 percent, and worldwide crisis  management the most important by 21 percent.</p>

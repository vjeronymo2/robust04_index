During the meeting, the committee expressed the hope that  efforts will succeed in putting all the remaining tense areas  under control, returning all military units to pre-crisis  positions, and showing these units' commitment to the  committee's instructions in accordance with the authority  entrusted to it by Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and  Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid.    The committee's official spokesman announced that the  committee-- composed of the Yemeni-Omani-Jordanian  commission--has met in Sanaa and Aden in the presence of the  U.S. and French military attaches. It agreed to return all the  units that had left their posts during the crisis to their  original stations, stop the clashes that have occurred in  certain areas, prevent the setting up of new posts on public  roads, and remove those newly set up posts, and prohibit any  military movement unless the Joint Military Committee approves  it.    The spokesman stated that the committee will undertake  observation duties and supervise the implementation of its  decision as of today, Monday.</p>

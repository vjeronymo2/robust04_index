			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / South bears brunt of big increase in unemployment: More defence industry jobs lost THE BRUNT of April's sharp rise in unemployment was borne by the southern regions of the UK, although the number of people out of work rose in all parts of the country except Northern Ireland. The rise was sharpest in the south-west, where a 0.3 per cent monthly increase in the number of jobless brought the total to 201,800. In the south-east, including London, unemployment rose by 0.1 per cent, bringing the rate of unemployment to 10.2 per cent. There were also sharp increases in the west Midlands and north-west, but economists suggested yesterday that the southern half of the country would continue to suffer the biggest monthly increases in unemployment as pressure on the service sector persis-ted. In Northern Ireland the level of unemployment remained unchanged in April compared with the previous month. Nevertheless, the rate of unemployment - at 14.3 per cent - remained the highest in the country. The overall weakness of the labour market was further reflected in a rise in the rate of male unemployment to 12.8 per cent from 10.1 per cent a year ago. Female unemployment remained significantly lower, rising to 5.2 per cent in April compared with 4.4 per cent a year ago. The level of female unemployment, and consequently overall unemployment, may be much higher, since many married women whose husbands work are not eligible for benefits and hence do not show up in the figures. Job vacancy statistics worsened with the number of unfilled vacancies, which account for about a third of all vacancies in the economy, falling by 7,900 to 119,600 - 2,200 fewer vacancies than in April last year. The Department of Employment said that over the past six months Jobcentre vacancies had risen by 2,700 a month on average. Employment in the manufacturing sector continued to decline. The number of employees in manufacturing in the UK fell to 4.5m, a fall of 26,000 on the month. Employment in the sector has fallen by 297,000 in the year to March, compared with a fall of 239,000 in the previous year. Measured on a quarterly basis, an improving trend in manufacturing employment was reversed in the three months to March. In the third and fourth quarters of last year manufacturing employment fell by 65,000 and 59,000 respectively compared with a fall of 101,000 in the second quarter. In the latest three months, employment in manufacturing industries fell by 72,000.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tashkent, April 19 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Premier Li  Peng, delivering a speech at the parliament of Uzbekistan here  this afternoon, stated what China considers the main content of  a new world order.    The world is moving toward multi-polarity and the Chinese  Government holds that such a trend is of positive significance,  he said.    "It is the common aspiration of people throughout the world  to preserve peace, strengthen cooperation and promote  development," he noted.    "However, we should also be aware that some problems left  over from the Cold War era remain to be resolved, while many new  conflicts and contradictions continue to crop up, leaving the  world far from peaceful," he added.    Also, many developing countries are becoming poorer, he  pointed out. "The issue of world peace is yet to be addressed,  while the problem of development is even more glaring," he said.    On the whole, the world is still locked in complicated and  profound changes, he said. "Therefore, the establishment of a  new international political and economic order represents the  urgent desire of all the peoples in the world."    "The new international political and economic order we  advocate is different in essence from the old order which was  marked by hegemonism and power politics," he said.    Li said, "we believe such a new order includes many  contents,  but its core is as follows:    -- In handling international relations, the principles of  mutual respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty, mutual  non-aggression, non-interference in each other's internal  affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence  should be strictly followed.    -- The right of different nations to choose the social  system  and mode of development compatible with their national  conditions should be respected.    -- All nations, big or small, strong or weak, rich or poor,  are entitled to participate in international affairs, which  should not be determined by one or several big countries.    -- Disputes between nations should be settled in a fair and  reasonable way through peaceful negotiations, in the spirit of  equal consultation, mutual understanding and mutual  accommodation.    When conditions are not ripe, disputes can be shelved  temporarily, in an effort to seek common ground while reserving  differences. Disputes over some issues should not hamper the  development of normal nation-to-nation relations.    -- Trade and economic cooperation should be conducted in  line  with the principles of equality, mutual benefit and exchange of  equal values. Developed nations face unshirkable  responsibilities for gradually reducing the gap between the  North and the South, or between developed and developing nations.    Li called the establishment of a new political and economic  order of the world "a long-term and arduous task," saying "we  are ready to work unremittingly towards that, along with all  countries in the world."</p>

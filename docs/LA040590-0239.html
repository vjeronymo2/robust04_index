			<p><P> April 5, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BASEBALL NOTES;  </P> <P> BRAVES RELEASE 21-YEAR VETERAN DARRELL EVANS  </P> <P> The Atlanta Braves have released first baseman Darrell Evans, possibly ending  the veteran infielder's career.  </P> <P> Evans, 42, was told of his release Wednesday in a 10-minute meeting with  Manager Russ Nixon.  </P> <P> The team opted to keep utility infielder Alexis Infante, who was acquired Nov.  20 from the Toronto Blue Jays.  </P> <P> Team officials invited Evans to remain in camp until Saturday, when the Braves  return to Atlanta for Tuesday's season opener.  </P> <P> Evans, a veteran of 21 years, said the prospects of continuing his career with  another team seem dim.  </P> <P> "It's happened to a lot of my friends and it's not easy," he said. "I guess  when it slaps you in the face you don't know how to feel. I don't know what to  expect because I've never been in this situation before."  </P> <P> During his career, Evans had 8,973 at-bats, four seasons with 30 home runs or  more, and a world championship with the Detroit Tigers in 1984.  </P> <P> Evans signed with the Braves as a minor league free agent in December, 1988. He  batted .207 last season, with 39 RBIs and 11 home runs.  </P> <P> Veteran first baseman Bill Buckner, trying to make the Red Sox as a non-roster  player, had a double and three singles Wednesday, raising his spring average to  .391, in Boston's 8-0 exhibition victory over the Kansas City Royals.  </P> <P> Pascual Perez made his spring debut for the New York Yankees and went three  innings -- 42 pitches -- in a 10-5 loss to Atlanta. Perez walked two, struck  out two and allowed one hit -- a three-run homer by Jeff Treadway.  </P></p>

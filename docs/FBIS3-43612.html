The establishment of a Afrikaner  homeland was inevitable and the Afrikaner nation would now use  other methods to gain its freedom within an own state, AVF  chairman and Conservative Party leader Dr Ferdi Hartzenberg said  in a statement on Monday.    The statement did not elaborate on the methods.    Dr Hartzenberg said said Mr Mandela's standpoint made on  SABC  [South African Broadcasting Corporation] TV on Sunday was  verified at a meeting on Monday afternoon between him and the  ANC president.    "Mr Mandela's viewpoint was that the Afrikaner should indeed  be accommodated, but that the concept of a volkstaat would have  to be discussed by all ANC structures, which was practically  impossible before April 27."    The AVF said Mr Mandela had undertaken to react to the AVF's  demands after proper consultation with members of his  organisation.</p>

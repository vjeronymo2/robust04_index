			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with RPF leader Alexis Kanyarengwe by </F> Frederic Fritscher in Mulindi on 26 June: "Rwandan Patriotic  Front Relaxes Its Position Toward Paris"]    [Excerpt] Kigali -- "We have never appreciated, much less  supported, the French intervention," RPF [Rwandan Patriotic  Front] leader Alexis Kanyarengwe said to us at his sanctuary in  Mulindi, located some 10 kilometers from the Ugandan border.  "When Paris made its decision, we considered it a gesture of  aggression. However, the international community, in the voice  of the UN Security Council, covered France. If France sticks to  its humanitarian mandate, then it will be a very good thing. We  are not in principle opposed to a humanitarian operation, we  simply would have preferred it to be carried out by soldiers  from another country."    The threat of confrontation between the RPF resistance  fighters and French troops is no longer valid, according to Mr.  Kanyarengwe. This contradicts what his representative in Europe,  Jacques Bihozagara, let it be understood on Thursday [23 June],  the day after his meeting with Alain Juppe. The RPF president  said he was reassured by the statements made by French diplomats  who came to Mulindi last last week to clarify Paris' intentions  to him. "I simply made it clear to them that the entire  territory of Rwanda is a zone of operations," he stressed.    The RPF's less virulent tone does not erase its old  grievances -- far from it. "France supported the old regime by  the military presence of its troops, financing and training  Rwandan military personnel and militias, and by diplomatic  actions abroad," Mr. Kanyarengwe recalled. He sees no "direct  involvement" by Paris in the attack which cost the life of  President Juvenal Habyarimana on 6 April.    Mr. Kanyarengwe is satisfied militarily. "The RPF now  occupies more than half of Rwandan territory. We hold the  prefectures of Byumbo, Kigali, and part of the Ruhengeri,  Gitarama, Gigumbo, and some areas in the prefecture of Butare,"  he said. "Kigali is under pressure and should fall soon. It is  just a matter of days now."    The RPF leader affirmed that he wanted to reach a cease-fire  agreement "with the government military forces" once the  massacres have ended. He demands that those responsible for the  genocide be brought to justice before discussing any alterations  to the Arusha accord. This accord, signed in August 1993 by the  Rwandan political parties, "will have to serve as the foundation  for setting up future transitional institutions," Mr.  Kanyarengwe said.

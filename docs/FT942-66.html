			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / International Company News: Rescue team dispute at Tatra eases A management dispute at Tatra, the troubled Czech truck maker, has eased after the company's main share-holders expressed support for its American-led rescue team. A statement issued after a board meeting yesterday said the Czech investment funds which control 60 per cent of Tatra's equity 'expect to reach agreement with (the American management team) for continued involvement with Tatra'. Shareholders met on Tuesday to iron out disagreements over management style. The team comprises Mr Gerald Greenwald, a former vice-president of Chrysler, the US carmaker, and Mr Jack Rutherford and Mr David Shelby, two former executives of International Harvester. They were offered a 15 per cent stake in the loss-making truck company last year in return for help in returning it to profit. Some Czech directors were critical of the management team's commitment to Tatra. They complained it did not spend enough time at the company to justify its continued involvement and its reported Dollars 120,000 a month retainer. Mr Greenwald rejected the criticism, saying the team expected to fulfil its contract, which continues until next March.</p>

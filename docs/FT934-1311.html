			<p>931220 FT  20 DEC 93 / Business Travel: Spacious sleeperettes take off - Why seat pitch is all to the discerning business class traveller Next year KLM, the Dutch carrier, will become the latest airline to revamp its business and rip out its first-class seats. To be installed are 'sleeperettes', seats that bear more resemblance to dentists' couches than the armchairs favoured by the biggest carriers such as British Airways, American Airlines and Japan Air Lines. KLM is joining a growing band of carriers that have abandoned conventional cabin classes in favour of larger seats for anyone prepared to pay the business-class prices. Others include Continental of the US and Virgin Atlantic in the UK. The reason behind the changes is that surveys show business travellers want more space, second only to safety and punctuality. Additional room is achieved by increasing the seat pitch - the distance between the rows - which in turn allows the seats to recline further, giving a less crowded feel to the cabin. Anyone who has tried the seats in super-business-class cabins knows they are a revelation. They feel like first class without the vintage champagne and caviar, and the service is similar to standard business class. But you can get a much better sleep on long-haul flights. Of the carriers that have taken this route, the standards setter is US carrier Continental. Its Business First cabin has a seat pitch of 55 inches, compared with a typical business class pitch of 38-40 inches and first class pitch of 60 inches. Business First is available on coast-to-coast US domestic routes as well as transatlantic and transpacific journeys. The quality of the product is reflected in the cheerful demeanour of the cabin crew. Virgin also has 55-inch seat pitches, in Upper Class, but its ageing cabins look more than a little frayed. The seats must be manually pushed into position, an awkward movement that pales beside Continental's automatic seat backs, footrests and lumbar support. Virgin's new aircraft, the Airbus A340, will be fitted with electrically adjustable seats and will be introduced gradually over the next two years. So far 55-inch pitches seem to be as far as carriers are prepared to go with super-business cabins. KLM is likely to fit 48-inch pitch seating, in line with US carrier NorthWest, in which it has a 20 per cent stake. Some airlines insist they will not alter their seating. British Airways argues that there is still a market for the super-luxury of first class among the rich and famous or industry bosses, whose expense accounts are checked only by the tax inspector. But for executives who see air travel as a business tool, the first choice should be super-business class. The price should be the same as business class - a round trip from London to Tokyo costs Pounds 3,179 on JAL, Virgin, BA and ANA - but on most criteria, the product is better.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- ROOM TO STRETCH OUT?  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Airline                               Seat pitch/                                         inches in                                    business class                                         long haul  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Continental                                    55 Virgin Atlantic                                55 NorthWest                                      48 American Airlines                              40 Japan Air Lines                                40 British Airways                             38-40 United Airlines                             38-40 Air France                                  37-40 Lufthansa                                   36-40  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- For comparison, economy class seat pitches are typically 32 inches and first class are 60 inches  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

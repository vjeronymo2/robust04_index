			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] A session of talks was held at al-Mushrif Palace  this morning between His Highness Shaykh Zayid Bin-Sultan Al  Nuhayyan, President of the United Arab Emirates, and his brother  His Excellency President Muhmmad Husni Mubarak of sisterly  Egypt. [passage omitted]    After the expanded meeting, a meeting confined to the two  leaders was held.    Egyptian Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa has stated that today's  main session of talks between the two leaders dealt with the  developments in the Gulf region and Arab developments in  general, the Middle East peace process, the results of the two  leaders' mediation to preserve Yemeni unity, the situation in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, and bilateral ties in the economic and  technical fields.    In a statement to the EMIRATES NEWS AGENCY, Musa said that  the two leaders noted their eagerness and efforts to preserve  Yemeni Unity and implement the Yemeni Pledge and Accord  Document. He noted that Badr Hammam, the assistant Egyptian  foreign minister, is now in Sanaa to pursue contacts between  Yemeni leaders in Sanaa and Aden.    Answering a question on whether the talks dealt with  arrangements to hold a quadrilateral Arab summit in Cairo to  deal with the Yemeni situation, Musa said that preparations have  not been made to hold this summit but the idea is still there.  This summit would require good planning to ensure its success.    Musa said that the two leaders expressed great interest in  developments in Bosnia-Hrezegovina and stressed the need for the  international community to end the Serb attack against the  people of Gorazde. Musa praised the NATO ultimatum to attack  Serb forces unless they withdrew from Gorazde and said that he  considered this a good move in the right direction if it  realizes the aim of stopping Serb attacks and establishing peace  in Bosnia-Herzegovina.</p>

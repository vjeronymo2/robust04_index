Suryanarayana: "Pakistan Move </F> Puts Kashmiris on Centre stage"]    [Excerpt] Dr. Farooq Abdullah, on the other hand,  emphasised the critical relevance of a tranquil Jammu and  Kashmir to Indo-Pakistan relations and to the secular traditions  of India.    In an interview in Geneva to a Pakistani newspaper, THE  NATION, Dr. Abdullah said: "Kashmir should be the bridge of  friendship between India and Pakistan, not a battleground for  their destruction."    Asked if the Kashmiris should be held "hostage" to the cause  of the Indian Muslims, he said: "When Pakistan was made, did you  think about the Indian Muslims or as to the tragedies that might  befall them? No. You just took a chunk of India thinking "well,  we have got our homeland, let these people go to hell or  wherever they have to go. We are not bothered about them." ...  "I think I would not like to see the blood of 200 million people  on my hands."    On whether the future of Indian Muslims would depend on what  might happen in Kashmir, Dr. Abdullah said: "The very fact of  secular India depends on the crown of India which is Kashmir.  The strongest pillar of that (Indian secularism) is Kashmir,  whether you like it or whether I like it. It is there and that  is what is going to maintain the secular character of India."    As for the political future of Jammu and Kashmir, Dr.  Abdullah said the existing Line of Actual Control (LAC) should  be "made into an international boundary," with both India and  Pakistan retaining the portions now under their respective  control. He also wanted Pakistan to give to the people of Jammu  and Kashmir on its side the same rights that "India is going to  give to this part." "That way," according to him, "neither  Pakistan will feel defeated nor India." He also expressed  readiness to talk to the Kashmiri leaders on the Pakistani side  within this framework of ideas. Dr. Abdullah did not wish to  make any distinction between Kashmiri Muslims and the Hindus and  other religious groups of the State.    He also spoke of the "training" given by Pakistan to the  Kashmiri youth and of "a number of instances where (the Indian)  security forces have lost their control and cool" in dealing  with the "terrorists." He did not want the northern territory to  be excluded from any settlement of the Indo-Pakistan  "territorial dispute" over Kashmir.</p>

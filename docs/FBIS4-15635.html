			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By UKRINFORM correspondent for TASS] </F>   [Text] Kiev April 10 TASS -- As of 19:00 local time (20:00  Moscow time) on Sunday, Ukraine's parliamentary elections can be  declared valid in nearly all regions of the republic.    Apart from 21 regions and the Crimean peninsula, where  turnout proved to be far above 50 per cent, the required number  of eligible voters came to the polls in the Khmelnitskiy and  Cherkassyy regions. Thus, the validity of today's polls remains  undecided only in the Odessa region, Kiev and Sevastopol,  according to UKRINFORM news agency.    Election results will be available after preliminary  counting  of votes. For the Ukrainian parliament to function normally, at  least 300 deputies should be elected to the 450-seat supreme  legislature.</p>

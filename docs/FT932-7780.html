			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Net assets improve at MCIT MEZZANINE Capital and Income Trust (2001) maintained its final dividend at 7.5p yesterday, as it announced an increase of 43 per cent in the net asset value of its capital shares and 9.6 per cent in the nav of its income shares in the year to March 31. The split capital invest- ment trust invests in the debt and in the shares of US com- panies. The portfolio, which is managed by Jordan-Zalasnick, the US group, has in- vestments in just eight companies. During the year, the trust realised an investment in Rockwood, which brought in Dollars 9m. A restructuring of American Safety Razor, another of the group's investments, resulted in MCIT receiving Dollars 1.2m of payment-in-kind notes. Although these are classed as revenue, they are not cash, and the board accordingly cut its interim dividend. The total dividend is thus down at 13.75p, against 14.5p. However, ASR has filed to make a public offering in the US. If this happens, MCIT will receive cash for the payment-in-kind notes, which it will distribute as a special interim dividend. The trust's equity assets were valued at Pounds 55.9m, up from Pounds 43.3m at the end of the previous financial year, an increase of 29 per cent. The net asset value per capital share was 255.3p, while nav per income share was 120.7p.</p>

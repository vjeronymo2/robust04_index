			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by XINHUA reporter Fan Liqing (5400 7787 7230): </F> "The Overall State of Cross-Strait Relations Should Be Taken  Into Consideration -- Our Hope Concerning Strait Exchange  Foundation Personnel Who Will Come to Hangzhou Because of the  Qiandaohu Incident"]    [Text] Beijing, 6 May (XINHUA) -- After the "Qiandaohu  incident" occurred, the Taiwan authorities repeatedly  disseminated "questionable points" concerning the incident,  condemned the mainland for "covering up facts," and even  showered abuse such as "bandits" on the mainland instead of  dealing with the matter calmly and judging the case as it  stands. Departments concerned even decided to "suspend  cross-strait cultural and educational exchanges and activities,"  "comprehensively boycott mainland tours," and other things.  What was more, after the mainland's public security department  announced that the case had been solved, Taiwan's "Mainland  Affairs Council" and "National Security Bureau" went so far as  to spread rumors, thus deliberately deepening Taiwan citizens'  misunderstandings against and estrangement from the mainland.  The action of some people in Taiwan is unfavorable to the  development of cross-strait relations.    The Qiandaohu incident is an unfortunate and rare  occurrence.  After it was reported, leaders of the CPC Central Committee and  the State Council have paid great attention to it. The Taiwan  Affairs Office under the State Council; departments of public  security, transportation, and tourism; the Zhejiang Provincial  Government; and the Association for Relations across the Taiwan  Strait [ARATS] have coordinated with each other with all their  might to deal with the aftermath of the incident. Over the  course of 17 days of hard work, the public security department  finally solved the case. It should be said that without the  great attention from all sectors and their all-out efforts, it  would not be an easy job to solve such a notably major case  within such a short time. We cannot but note that some of the  Taiwan authorities had ulterior motives when they turned a blind  eye to such efforts and went about stirring up Taiwan  compatriots' resentment against the mainland.    After over 40 years of separation, the personnel contacts  and  trade and economic exchanges between the two sides of the strait  are not only conducive to the development of cross-strait  relations but also benefit compatriots on both sides during  their exchanges. In the past few years, the exchanges and  contacts between people on both sides have been growing  frequent. The number of Taiwan compatriots coming to the  mainland for tours, sightseeing, investment, and various kinds  of exchanges and activities increases by the day. Taiwan  compatriots have altogether made over 5 million visits to the  mainland. The mainland has attached importance to cross-strait  relations, cross-strait exchanges and contacts, and the  guarantee of the rights and interests of the broad masses of  Taiwan compatriots; the safety of the lives and property of  Taiwan compatriots touring the mainland is protected by the law.    Of course, there have been some incidents causing serious  losses of lives and property of people on both sides of the  strait in recent years. We maintain that the fundamental  experience, as well as the fundamental attitude, in properly  handling such types of individual incidents should take into  consideration the overall state of developing cross-strait  relations and maintaining the legitimate rights and interests of  people on both sides; approach these incidents objectively,  calmly, and practically; and never seize on the incident to  exaggerate matters and deliberately harm cross-strait relations  as well as the feelings of people on both sides. The mainland  has been doing exactly this. In 1990, two incidents caused the  deaths of 46 mainland compatriots during the repatriation of  mainland fishermen by the relevant departments of Taiwan, and in  recent years, Taiwan's military police repeatedly fired at and  shelled mainland fishing boats in the Taiwan Strait, causing  several casualties. Can it be said that the families of the  dead mainland compatriots felt no grief and indignation?  However, when the mainland handled these incidents, it assumed  the attitude of taking cross-strait relations into account so  that cross-strait relations did not regress, and the feelings of  people on both sides thus were not hurt because of the  aforementioned incidents. This has constituted a sharp contrast  to the Taiwan authorities' attitude in handling the Qiandaohu  incident.    As far as the Qiandaohu incident is concerned, it should be  normal that families of Taiwan compatriots and relevant  departments in Taiwan might have different opinions and views on  the handling of the victimized Taiwan compatriots at the  beginning of the case. In an attitude of giving priority to the  fundamental interests of people of both sides and through  patient communication and coordination, however, it is not  difficult to solve the problem rationally. As for the case, the  principle of "judging the criminal case as it stands" must be  upheld. The case could be solved promptly or slowly, and it is  certain that the public security department will investigate the  case thoroughly and catch the real culprits. This is not only  an issue concerning the protection of Taiwan compatriots' rights  and interests but also is a measure that the mainland must take  to ensure social order. The correct action for the Taiwan  authorities should be consoling the victims' relatives, so how  could they intentionally take advantage of their grief and  sorrow to stir up people's resentment? Moreover, such types of  incident are not the fault of cross-strait exchanges, and people  on the two sides will not, and are unlikely to, stop their  contacts and tours because of an accidental criminal case. The  Taiwan authorities, however, wanted to suspend this and hold  that on the pretext of this incident, in an effort to harm  cross-strait relations.    It can be seen that because of different social systems on  the two sides, plus 30 to 40 years of separation, there are some  differences in their concepts and measures for approaching  problems. But this does not matter. As long as the two sides  hold frequent contacts, including contacts of high-ranking  personnel such as holding the second Wang Daohan-Gu Zhenfu [Ku  Chen-fu] talks, based on the common belief of promoting the  development of cross-strait relations, such misunderstandings  can be eliminated completely, and their common ground can be  enhanced. Now, the ARATS has once again invited personnel of  the Strait Exchange Foundation [SEF] and its experts to Hangzhou  to hear the briefing by investigators of the case on the case's  details. The ARATS has also agreed, in principle, to exchange  opinions with the SEF on incidents involving the safety and the  losses of lives and property of compatriots on the two sides in  the course of cross-strait exchanges in recent years, and it has  put forward specific suggestions. This is an important move to  intensify communication, eliminate the negative effect caused by  the Qiandaohu incident, and develop cross-strait relations. We  hope that both of them will make earnest efforts to develop  cross-strait relations, and we sincerely hope that the SEF  personnel will depart for the mainland as soon as possible and,  taking the overall state of cross-strait relations into  consideration, will further eliminate the misunderstanding and  estrangement through understanding and make contributions to  maintaining and developing cross-strait relations.</p>

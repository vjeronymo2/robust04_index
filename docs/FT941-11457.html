			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / TSB to pre-notify on all charges TSB Group said yesterday that it is to become the first bank to pre-notify its personal customers of all charges on current accounts, including those for returned cheques and letters written by managers, John Gapper writes. It is introducing full pre-notification of charges immediately. Along with National Westminster Bank, it already pre-notifies customers of selected charges including overdraft payments and fees. Banks have been moving towards pre-notification of charges on monthly statements, and the voluntary code of practice adhered to by all large banks is expected to be revised shortly to include pre-notification.</p>

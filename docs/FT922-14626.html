			<p>920406 FT  06 APR 92 / Survey of Latin American Finance and Investment (12): Nightmare begins to fade - Is the debt crisis over? / Examining the present position THE prospect that Brazil and Argentina will soon have outline debt restructuring agreements with commercial banks has raised hopes that the final chapter on the Latin American debt crisis will be concluded before its 10th anniversary. But are the hopes justified? In the sense in which it was originally perceived - that of a threat to the international banking system caused by the risk of widespread default by Latin American governments on foreign bank debt - the crisis was over some time ago. However, the passing of the threat to the system did not mean an end of the threat to individual banks. Some banks, particularly those in the US, took a long time to recover. By the time the threat of their Third World debt had receded, they had gathered a host of new problem loans closer to home. Nonetheless, settlements with the first and third largest debtors in Latin America should be an immense relief to many banks. According to bank analysts at Salomon Brothers: 'If . . . Argentina and Brazil each sign a Brady Plan-type agreement in 1992, the nightmare of the cross-border overhang of the 1980s will fade rapidly into memory.' From the point of view of the debtor countries, however, the picture is different. Their emergence from the crisis has certainly been slower and some economies remain overloaded by debt. It is undeniable that their prospects improved significantly following the launch three years ago of the debt initiative named after the US Treasury Secretary, Mr Nicholas Brady. This shifted the emphasis of the international debt strategy towards a reduction of bank debt burdens away from one which inevitably encouraged further enlargement of debt stocks. The psychological boost from the Brady debt agreement - coupled with tight fiscal control and economic and trade reform - transformed international perceptions of the Mexican economy. Moreover, the apparent economic success of Mexico (and Chile, which eschewed a Brady-style debt restructuring) has had a huge demonstration effect on economic policies in the rest of the region. Three questions arise: To what extent do Brady-style debt restructuring agreements allow governments to consign their debt problems to history? To what extent are the capital inflows to Latin America building another debt crisis for the future? To what extent have the various debt initiatives provided the means for the rest of the heavily indebted countries in the region to emerge from their problems? When viewed purely in cash-flow terms, the benefit of Mexico's Brady deal - finally put into effect two years ago - was extremely modest. The recent fall in US interest rates has, if anything, provided a greater reduction to Mexico's debt servicing burden. Most important was the confidence engendered by the accord. The announcement of an agreement in principle with the banks in the summer of 1990 was enough to trigger an immediate drop in domestic interest rates, which reduced the government's cost of servicing its own short-term domestic debt. They have continued to fall. Business confidence also boomed, helped by the government's decision to negotiate a free trade accord with the US and Canada. In the cases of Argentina and Brazil, this confidence effect is going to be smaller. Mr Lawrence Brainard, an economist with the US investment bank, Goldman Sachs, in New York, reckons that in Argentina much of the effect of an agreement with the commercial banks has been discounted. In the case of Brazil, uncertainties over the government's fiscal position and its need (because of a lack of resources) to spread out the provision of financial guarantees to banks, suggests increased confidence will only accrue slowly. Furthermore, the reduction in debt may be more modest even than in the Mexican case. Brazil's Brady debt accord will cover only Dollars 40bn of medium-term bank debt, compared to an end-1990 total foreign debt burden of Dollars 116.2bn; Argentina's will cover Dollars 24bn of medium-term bank debt, compared with a Dollars 61.1bn total. What is more, to make up for its lack of resources to provide guarantees, Brazil will need to encourage a larger proportion of banks to lend more money, rather than give debt relief. Thus, while Brady deals will send important signals to the financial and business communities inside and outside the two countries, they can provide no guarantees that debt problems will not emerge again. Indeed, this cannot be guaranteed - many would argue - without sustained economic reform to correct imbalances in government budgets. Nonetheless, the suggestion that the capital inflows into Latin America are creating a new debt crisis is probably a little far-fetched, for now, although it would probably be unwise to dismiss the possibility out of hand. In the case of Mexico, which enjoys a huge share of the inflows, there are reasons - in spite of a current account deficit likely to exceed Dollars 15bn this year - that differentiate what is happening today from what happened in the late 1970s. The government is running a budget surplus, even before privatisation, receipts from which are being used to pay down government debt. The current account deficit is thus a private sector phenomenon. The government says a large proportion of the current account deficit arises from imports of capital goods, rather than consumer items. Provided that capital is used productively, such imports should provide returns to allow repayment of any debt incurred for their purchase. A significant proportion of the inflows are of equity rather than debt, which cannot by definition cause a debt crisis. Much of the new debt consists of fixed-rate bonds rather than floating rate debt. It is thus less susceptible to an upward spike in US interest rates than was the bank debt of the late 1970s. The international bond market should also be more sensitive to credit and supply concerns than were international banks in the 1970s, giving more scope for rationing by price. Scenarios can be constructed whereby all this could degenerate into a new problem: a financial crisis in the private sector, for example, that forces the Mexican government to step in to take over private liabilities, comparable to Chile's banking crisis of the 1980s. No such crisis is in sight, however, and the probability of one emerging in the near future must be rated as negligible. For many of the region's smaller countries, however, the problems remain. Many are hobbled by a large debt to foreign governments, or to the international financial institutions such as the International Monetary Fund. For the poorest, such as Nicaragua, more generous concessions have been made to reduce their debt servicing burdens, although the two-thirds debt forgiveness envisaged in the UK's Trinidad Terms initiative has failed to meet agreement among government creditors. For slightly richer countries, particularly those who owe most of their debt to governments rather than banks, the mechanisms exist only to chip away at the debt burden. The international financial institutions have been more flexible of late, as have their leading shareholders, in helping countries dig themselves out of arrears in payments to them. However, they have had to retain their paramount concern for their own financial integrity. For those governments, such as Peru, which owe a large part of their debt to such institutions, the future still looks very difficult.</p>

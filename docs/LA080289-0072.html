Ileana Ros-Lehtinen won the Republican primary while two  Democrats headed into a runoff in contests to choose nominees to succeed the  late Rep. Claude Pepper (D-Fla.) in an election that could produce the first  Cuban-American member of Congress. With all the Republican votes counted,  Cuban-born Ros-Lehtinen swept to an easy victory with 16,952 votes, or 82.7% of  the total ballots cast. Her closest challenger was businessman Carlos Perez  with 2,261, or 11%. In the Democratic contest, former Miami City Commissioner  Rosario Kennedy and former Florida Bar president Gerald Richman qualified for  an Aug. 15 runoff. With 98% of the votes counted, Richman had 5,595 votes, or  28.1%. Kennedy had 5,438 votes, or 27.3%. Federal probation officer Jo Ann  Pepper, the late congressman's niece, missed the runoff with 4,772 votes, or  24%.  </P></p>

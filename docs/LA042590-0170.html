Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> SCHWARZENEGGER NOT 'AS HUNGRY'  </P> <P> Pump-it-up Arnold Schwarzenegger is mellowing out.  </P> <P> The 42-year-old muscle man who won Mr. Universe five times, was named Mr.  Olympia seven times and starred in a series of hit movies that grossed more  than $1 billion says he is no longer "as hungry, not driving as hard."  </P> <P> He drinks coffee, smokes cigars, is down to a trim 215 pounds and professes to  be a devoted daddy, treasuring the early morning wake-up screams of his  2-month-old daughter, Katherine, according to the May issue of GQ magazine.  </P> <P> Schwarzenegger is married to NBC newswoman Maria Shriver.  </P> <P> Learning to diaper the child proved to be a challenge. "The first time, I got  the waistband around the baby's neck," he admitted. His latest movie, "Total  Recall," an adventure set in the future, comes out next month.  </P></p>

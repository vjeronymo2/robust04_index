			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Massimo Arcidiacono: "Fiscal Federalism, </F> Umberto Raises the Stakes"]    [Text] Umberto Bossi wanted all his electoral "apostles"  gathered around him for the presentation of the election  manifesto (red binder, 40 closely written pages, which each one  clutches under his or her arm). It is the official baptism of a  new political battle that will last a month and change the  country, and it is perhaps a benediction as well: "I want you  to go out there and tell the people that we have remained what  we were in the beginning, we have not changed, we have done our  utmost for federalism. We have done all that could be done."  Bossi's oratorical style is the same as at the latest rallies  (Baggio, Brescia, Piacenza). He lashes out all round: at  Fini's "fascists," at Occhetto's "communists," and at his ally,  Berlusconi, as well. As to the rest, Bossi leafs through the  book of League dreams for the benefit of his future deputies.  Fiscal federalism, free market forces, fewer direct taxes and  lower labor costs, privatization taken to extremes, and so on:  a list of things to be done now made flesh in the Northern  League's "abridged election manifesto."  <H5>  Public Deficit </H5>   "What needs to be done is: diverting public spending away  from current expenditures toward investment expenditure,  restructuring the public system, reducing state interference in  the economy in favor of private initiative." The specific  measures suggested include restructuring the civil service,  radically reviewing state holdings, privatization, lowering  interest rates, replacing the loss of earnings compensation fund  and the "mobility" system with unemployment benefits, tax  incentives for private investment, greater recourse to forms of  indirect taxation, and the creation of fiscal federalism.  <H5>  Fiscal Federalism </H5>   "Fiscal federalism comprises two basic elements: investing  the local authorities with full autonomy in matters of taxation,  and making the local authorities responsible for spending, which  must be commensurate with revenue." A percentage of such revenue  must be payable to the federal state so that it can "finance  matters of general interest," but it is the prerogative of the  local authorities to administer the major part of their revenue.  <H5>  Industrial Policy </H5>   "This must evolve along totally different lines from those  followed to date. The first major difference must consist in  drawing a clear distinction between the type of development  pursued in the north and the type pursued in the south." The  north must widen its product range and promote research; the  south, "complementing (and not in competition with) the north,"  must develop products "appropriate to its geocultural  conditions" (specialized tourism and agriculture, aerospace).  <H5>  Employment </H5>   "More market forces and less state intervention to tackle  unemployment" is the slogan. "We must put a stop to the welfare  handout policy, lighten the burden of taxation and other levies,  abolish unjustified welfare charges. invest in research,  introduce wage zoning [system whereby wage levels vary according  to region] to boost employment, especially in the south....  Greater flexibility is needed as regards both working hours and  atypical forms of employment. The regulatory and fiscal  framework must be simplified to stimulate an increase in  self-employment."  <H5>  Trade </H5>   The goal is to create "a free market accessible to all  competent, hardworking traders," and, to this end, "the law must  provide tax incentives for widening, specializing, converting,  merging, and ceding businesses." A gradual liberalization of  licenses and the pursuit of alternative solutions to the  deregulation of opening hours are advocated.  <H5>  Immigration </H5>   "The flow of immigration must be stemmed and the requisite  labor quotas might be strictly subject to possession of a work  contract and access to housing."  <H5>  Defense </H5>    "The armed forces must be radically restructured via the  creation of a mixed, i.e., volunteer-professional and draft,  recruitment system." Also: the safeguarding and preserving of  peace in areas of fundamental strategic and economic importance;  an increased effort in the fight against organized crime,  consider the defense industry as a strategic public base  essential to the whole industrial system; recognize the right of  conscientious objection and create a generalized national  civilian service.  <H5>  Broadcasting </H5>   The League wants a privatized RAI [Italian Broadcasting  Corporation] restricted, as far as current affairs are  concerned, to accurate, strictly factual news bulletins.  Privatizing the RAI "will bring about a restructuring in the  private sector," with clear-cut rules that will "restore the  right to equal time" and introduce "strict antitrust regulations  and well-defined limits on advertising."  <H5>  Health </H5>   "Full financial, administrative, and legislative autonomy  for  the regions," plus: greater powers to be invested in the  provincial authorities, reduction of the ministry's role,  radical transformation of the USSL's [local health care units]  into health care districts, "true specialized concerns managed  as businesses, the abolition of health insurance via the  national health fund, and freedom of choice...between private  insurance cover and nonprofit professional and vocational health  and insurance funds."</p>

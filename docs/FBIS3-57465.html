"It needs to be emphasized that the Russians have chosen  democracy," Aho said. He said becoming a member in the Council  of Europe was an important step in the process of  democratization. Therefore, Russia and the other countries that  have expressed the wish to join the CE should be accepted as  quickly as possible, the Finnish leader said.    When asked by the head of the Estonian delegation to the  meeting, Tunne Kelam, if Russia should become a CE member even  before it has withdrawn its troops from Estonia and Latvia, Aho  said he favored the pullout of Russian troops, but added that  Russia had to be accepted into the European body in any case.    Finland on Wednesday was the only country in the Strasbourg  meeting to give its unconditional support to granting Russia a  full member status. Russian officials have already made a  number of statements hailing Finland.</p>

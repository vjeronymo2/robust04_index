			<p>930527 FT  27 MAY 93 / Observer: Knife edge 'The best of pals' has not been the best of descriptions for two of the Treasury's consultant clairvoyants, Tim Congdon and Patrick Minford. The reason is that Congdon has openly declared that Minford's knowledge of economics leaves much to be desired. Hence the fascination of their scheduled appearance together this evening on a public platform at the Cardiff Business School, where they both hold chairs. Will they bury the hatchet, or put one another to the sword?</p>

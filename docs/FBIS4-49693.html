			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Cao Zhenxi (2580 2182 6007), Sheng Zhenxian </F> (4141 4176 6343), and reporter Qiao Linsheng (0829 2651 3932):  "Zhongnanhai's Deep Love--A Record of Party and Government  Attaching Importance to the Work of Placement of Transferred  Military Cadres"]    [Text] The "second employment" of retired officers--an  important task which has lasted for nearly half a century  following the republic's founding.    No matter how we write our history and how we plan our  future, we will not forget that everyone, ranging from leaders  of the republic to ordinary functionaries, and every unit,  ranging from senior government and Army organs to placement  departments at all levels in various localities and Army units,  have devoted their enthusiasm and energies to enabling millions  of officers, who have fulfilled the glorious task of defending  our motherland, to "transfer their battleground" smoothly, so  that each of them is properly provided for and lives and works  in peace and contentment.    In this account, we, as witnesses of the work, set down a  true record of the key activities and relevant historical facts  over the past few years showing how our party and government  were concerned about and set store by the work of placement of  demobilized officers.    1. As long as you pay a little attention, you will find  that from 1990 on, senior party and government leaders were  present and delivered speeches at almost every important  activity on the work of placement of demobilized Army officers.    Officers must retire after a certain number of years of  service, as is the case in every country of the world. In both  developed and developing countries, the issue of placement of  retired officers occupies an important place in state affairs.  In our country, proper placement of Army officers transferred  to civilian work is an important system of our party and  government.    The first officer demobilization order following the PRC's  founding was signed by Chairman Mao Zedong. The first director  of the central committee for changing jobs and construction was  Premier Zhou Enlai. The founders of the republic were  circumspect and farsighted, they devised good strategies,  elaborated the key principles of placement of demobilized Army  officers, and drew up a series of placement policies and  measures so that the work, which affects a great deal of the  social fabric, was done in an orderly way and step by step with  a good beginning and solid foundations.    Full-scale reconstruction was to be carried out after the  Cultural Revolution. Comrade Deng Xiaoping, nucleus of the  second-generation leadership, made historic contributions to the  resumption and development of the system of placement of  demobilized Army officers, which had been suspended for a  decade. Following the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC  Central Committee, he brought order out of chaos and decisively  rectified the problem by which 410,000 Army officers were  mistakenly handled and demobilized from 1969 to 1975.    Times change but we are carrying forward the cause pioneered  by our predecessors and forging ahead into the future. The  third-generation leadership with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the  core, while bearing the great cause of national reform in mind,  is often concerned about the current situation and the future of  the work of placement of demobilized Army officers and  constantly carries forward under the new situation the fine  tradition of veteran proletarian revolutionaries attaching  importance to the work of placement of demobilized Army officers.    As long as you pay a little attention, you will find that  from April 1990 on, senior party and government leaders were  present and delivered speeches at almost every important  activity on the work of placement of demobilized Army officers.  The written instructions given by General Secretary Jiang Zemin  and Premier Li Peng on documents related to placement of  demobilized officers, which were conscientious and to the point,  were clearly seen. Last year alone, General Secretary Jiang  four times gave important instructions on the work of placement  of demobilized Army officers.    In particular, the two scenes in which General Secretary  Jiang requested local party committees and governments to do  well the work of placement of demobilized Army officers are  unforgettable, moving, and inspiring. The first occasion was on  10 April 1990. The international situation then was turbulent  and volatile, while our country was confronted with many new  domestic conditions. Comrades in the Army and those in various  localities worried about whether or not proper arrangements  could be made for over 30,000 officers transferred to civilian  work that year and whether or not the work could be done on  time. That day, at 1500, General Secretary Jiang, who wore a  Chinese tunic suit, and other central leading comrades came to  the assembly hall where the National Work Meeting on Placement  of Demobilized Army Officers was being held. General Secretary  Jiang said with deep feeling: With so many years of trials, our  Army officers are of good quality and have a fine tradition of  engaging in ideological and political work, and such talents are  needed to fill various local posts. On the other hand, there  are still many specialized talents in the People's Liberation  Army [PLA], and we should try our best to make proper  arrangements for this group of demobilized officers so that they  can become the backbone of various trades and professions. I  request all of you to make concerted efforts to accomplish this  work. His voice was so sonorous and forceful that it struck  deep in every comrade's heart like drumbeats. In consequence,  the work of placement of demobilized officers proceeded very  smoothly that year.    The second occasion was on 19 May 1993. That year, the  Army implemented the CPC Central Committee and the CPC Central  Military Commission's strategic policy decision of restructuring  and streamlining the establishment, and nearly 6,000 officers  were transferred to local civilian work. Likewise, efforts were  made to start implementing the restructuring of local party and  government organs and arrangements had to be made for a number  of redundant personnel. It can be understood how difficult the  work of placement of demobilized Army officers was. Bearing in  mind that Army restructuring and streamlining is a major and  very onerous task which the Army itself must make great efforts  in and which the party and the state must extend vigorous  support to, General Secretary Jiang Zemin came to the conference  hall again and delivered a speech full of enthusiasm at a time  when the annual National Work Meeting on Placement of  Demobilized Army Officers was being held:    From the day they enlist in the Army, our Army officers work  very hard for our national defense and defense construction.  When these comrades are transferred to civilian work, the state  must make appropriate arrangements for them in a responsible  manner. Hence, we must further mobilize everyone to support the  work, because whether or not good arrangements are made for  these officers will have a great bearing on the stability of our  society and our Army as well as on our country's overall  economic construction. Therefore, to put it in a nutshell, I  request you accomplish the work! Moreover, when you return to  your units, please report to your party committees the message  that we request your local party committees at all levels to  make good arrangements for demobilized Army officers.    The audience burst into prolonged thunderous applause, which  conveyed to General Secretary Jiang the determination and  confidence of those engaging in the work of transferring Army  officers to civilian work and which conveyed to the CPC Central  Committee, the state Council, and the Central Military  Commission the most sincere tribute and gratitude of officers  and men.    The general secretary's request was transmitted to all  quarters, just like great waves radiating from a rock. Various  provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities took action,  as did various prefectures, cities, and counties. By the end of  1993, 60,000 demobilized officers, along with over 17,000 family  members, were assigned to their respective posts around our  motherland.    2. Our party and government always remember the  sacrifices and contributions made by demobilized Army officers  for the cause of socialist construction.    Nearly 3 million Army officers have been successively  transferred to localities since our country was founded more  than 40 years ago. They are still carrying forward our Army's  honorable tradition and fighting to their last breath on all  fronts in our motherland, thus adding a glorious chapter to  their undisputed contributions to our party and our people.  Zhao Dongwan, former minister of personnel, once enumerated  demobilized Army officers' illustrious achievements in the cause  of socialist construction:    During the period of national economic restoration, over  300,000 Army officers took off their uniforms and turned  themselves into a large contingent engaging in railway  construction, irrigation works, forestry, and the petroleum  industry in our motherland. They also turned themselves into  building units and troops stationed to open up wasteland. In  the spring of 1958, 100,000 demobilized officers and men trod  ice and snow and moved into the great northern wilderness.  After over 30 years of arduous efforts in pioneering work, they  built up our country's key commodity grain-producing base on  land with no sign of human habitation. In the early sixties,  another group of 130,000 selected outstanding grass-roots Army  officers were transferred to the commercial front and made  important contributions to economic development and the  guarantee of supply. From 1985 to the present, 100,000  demobilized officers have been assigned to public security,  judicial, and procuratorial departments and to courts; 180,000  have been assigned to industrial and commercial, taxation, and  financial departments; 85,000 have been assigned to key state  construction projects and newly established and expanded units;  and 90,000 have been assigned to education, scientific research,  cultural, and public health departments. Among them, 75,000  have been elected model and advanced workers by units at and  above the county level; 5,200 have been elected outstanding  entrepreneurs; 158,000 have been elected outstanding ideological  and political workers; and 154,000 have assumed posts at and  above the county and department levels or the equivalent. We  can say that the footprints of demobilized Army officers'  struggles have been left everywhere in our motherland's history  of starting undertakings and that their painstaking efforts are  reflected in the achievements scored by various trades and  professions.    Our party and government always remember the sacrifices and  contributions made by demobilized Army officers for the cause of  socialist construction. In October 1991, the National Meeting  on Commending Model Demobilized Army Officers was solemnly  called with the approval of the State Council and the Central  Military Commission, and 213 national model demobilized Army  officers happily gathered in Beijing and were commended by the  state and the people. This was another grand gathering held  since our motherland's founding wherein a large number of model  demobilized Army officers was commended.    During the commendation meeting, State Council Premier Li  Peng spared time to meet model workers. On the afternoon of 22  October, it was close to 1700 after Comrade Li Peng had  completed his meeting with the last group of foreign visitors,  but he did not care about his tiredness and hurried to the  conference hall. As he walked, he kept saying: "I am sorry to  make you all wait a long time." He said cordially: First of  all, on behalf of the CPC Central Committee and the State  Council, I convey to you our heartfelt congratulations on the  outstanding achievements scored at your respective posts. In  his speech, which was full of enthusiasm and commendation,  Premier Li stressed: "Due to the good training they received in  the Army, demobilized Army officers have a higher political  quality. They have also mastered a good many skills while  undergoing the dual-purpose talent training in the Army. The  CPC Central Committee and the State Council always hold that  demobilized Army officers are an important force in socialist  modernization. As proved by practice, demobilized Army officers  have been playing a very good role on every socialist front."  He sincerely wished everybody to continue carrying forward our  fine tradition, to maintain our honor, and to make further new  contributions.    The successful convening of the commendation meeting  evoked strong repercussions in the Army and in various  localities and played a very good role in bringing about good  practice in society of understanding and showing respect for  demobilized Army officers and extending support to the work of  placement of demobilized Army officers.    Now, on the land of the republic, no matter where they are,  demobilized Army officers are developing eye-catching  undertakings; and no matter which profession they are in,  demobilized Army officers are creating glories of revitalizing  our motherland.    3. Under the condition of developing a socialist market  economy, should we or should we not uphold the guiding ideology  of "two services" in the work of placement of demobilized Army  officers? the central leadership "put it in this way."    The guiding ideology of the work of placement of demobilized  Army officers, which was established by Mao Zedong and Zhou  Enlai and which we have upheld for several decades, is to "be  subordinate to the needs of state economic construction and  defense construction and to merge the two into an integrated  whole. Should we or should we not uphold it under the condition  of developing a socialist market economy?    On 13 November 1993, after listening to the report made by  Yu  Yongbo, director of the PLA's General Political Department, Hu  Jintao, standing committee member of the central CPC Political  Bureau and member of the central CPC Secretariat, said to Lu  Feng, head of the Organization Department under the CPC Central  Committee, and Minister of Personnel Song Defu, who were  present: Should the guiding ideology of the work of placement  of demobilized Army officers be through "one service" or through  "two services"? In my view, "two services" is still better.  The work of placement of demobilized Army officers must serve  economic construction and reform and opening up, but, at the  same time, it must help consolidate the stability of the Army,  since without a reliable guarantee of security, we cannot  achieve success in economic construction. Leading comrades at  the central level "put it in this way." A comrade engaging in  the work of placement of demobilized Army officers said with  deep feeling: "As far as the work of placement of demobilized  Army officers is concerned, it is as if we are shouldering two  burdens at the same time, with one end tied to the state and the  other tied to the Army, and consideration must be given to both!"    As far as the task of serving defense construction is  concerned, making arrangements for demobilized Army officers and  straightening out the channel for "exporting" Army officers is  essential to realizing the supersession of old officers by new  ones, improving the quality of our Army, and enhancing our  Army's combat strength, because over 90 percent of Army officers  are faced with the problem of transference to civilian work.  Liu Huaqing, vice chairman of the Central Military Commission,  once said that good placement of demobilized Army officers has  extremely important significance. It is beneficial to make  arrangements for demobilized Army officers because they also  possess a number of favorable conditions. Most of them once  studied in military academies and have a high level of  education. Officers holding posts in divisions and regiments,  who once tempered themselves at the grass-roots level, have rich  working experience and good political quality. After their  transfer to various localities, some of the Army officers  originally holding posts in divisions and regiments are still  young compared with some local cadres, and it is precisely the  time to bring their abilities into play. Hence, it is really a  matter of vital and lasting importance to make good arrangements  for and to make good use of them. As far as the task of  serving state economic construction is concerned, demobilized  Army officers are an important source of local cadres and an  important force in socialist construction of the "two  civilizations." The fact that group after group of Army  officers are being transferred to various localities not only  invigorates the contingent of local cadres but is also  beneficial to our country's reform, development, and stability.  As General Secretary Jiang commented, it will not work if none  of the local cadres has any military knowledge. Some of the  outstanding Army officers may be overage in the Army, but  certain arrangements can be made to transfer them to various  localities.    A review of the history of the work of placement of  demobilized officers can show that our party and government  always uphold the guiding ideology of making the work of  placement of demobilized officers serve defense and economic  construction. It has become the foundation for reaching a  common understanding between various sectors, the basis for  formulating policies and stipulations, and the yardstick for  measuring the results of the placement work. No matter what  changes the objective situation undergoes, we will steadfastly  uphold the guiding ideology.    4. Our party and government have been, as always,  making appropriate arrangements for demobilized officers and  bear responsibility for them to the end, and the state and local  governments at all levels have invested a great deal of  manpower, materiel, and financial resources in this respect.    There are so many things to consider regarding the work of  placement of demobilized Army officers, but the ultimate aim is  to make appropriate arrangements for demobilized Army officers.    On the morning of 26 March 1990, General Secretary Jiang  visited the PLA delegation present at the Third Session of the  Seventh National People's Congress [NPC] and took part in the  discussion. Wang Aiwu, deputy from the frontier guards in  Heilongjiang, reported on the situation of making arrangements  for demobilized officers, and his remarks attracted the  attention of General Secretary Jiang, who jotted down notes  while listening to Wang's speech. During a break in the  meeting, he asked leaders of the Central Military Commission on  the spot about the situation concerned. On 10 April, he thought  about this matter again when receiving delegates to the National  Work Meeting on the Placement of Demobilized Army Officers. He  said: Not long ago, I took part in the meeting of the PLA  delegation present at the NPC session and heard a report on the  placement of demobilized servicemen, and I do have some ideas.  Since our country's economy is, after all, not very strong,  therefore, certain difficulties still remain in defense  construction and in placement of demobilized servicemen. We  must conduct some surveys to see how the work can be improved  under the existing economic strength and conditions.    After General Secretary Jiang had made the remarks, the  CPC Central Committee's Organization Department, the State  Council's Ministry of Personnel, and the General Political  Department immediately studied ways to solve the job arrangement  problem of demobilized officers. In a short span of two months,  they formulated and issued to lower levels the "Circular on  Accomplishing the Work of Assigning Demobilized Regimental  Officers to New Posts," that is, the "Document No. 3" well-known  to Army officers. The document laid down concrete stipulations  on jobs assigned to Army officers transferred to various  localities in light of the duration of their active service and  the extent of their contributions. That year, a number of  measures were taken by various localities, including assigning  Army officers still in active service to civilian posts,  allowing them to work in localities before they had been  formally demobilized, and reserving civilian posts for them in  advance. As a result, 95 percent of over 2,000 officers with  regimental duties satisfying the job-arrangement conditions were  assigned to corresponding posts; while the situation of  arranging jobs for other regimental officers was also markedly  improved, since the percentage for which corresponding posts  were arranged increased by 35.8 percent.    Leading comrades of the CPC Central Committee and of the  Central Military Commission also set much store by the situation  in implementing the policy on placement of demobilized Army  officers. Last year, due to the large number of demobilized  officers or for other reasons, a small number of localities did  not implement the policy of arranging jobs for demobilized  regimental officers. After learning of this situation, General  Secretary Jiang Zemin instructed leaders of the General  Political Department to make a report directly to Comrade Hu  Jintao. On 27 November 1993, Zhang Zhen, vice chairman of the  Central Military Commission, wrote comments on materials  reflecting the problem and instructed relevant departments to  immediately study ways to solve it. With joint efforts by the  Army and local authorities, the problem was solved step by step.    Our party and government leaders are very much concerned  about the difficulties faced by officers and men stationed for a  long time in areas where conditions are hardest, such as the  border, islands, highlands, and deserts, as well as the  placement problem after their transfer to civilian posts. The  leaders have repeatedly instructed departments concerned to  study and solve the problem by working out relevant policies  which show the solicitude of our party and government for them.  The stipulations introduced in April 1990, which concerned  recruiting and taking care of demobilized officers serving in  the Army for a long time, occupying senior posts, and making  great contributions to the Army, were precisely the outcome of  the guiding ideology. The implementation of these stipulations  fully embodies our party's principles of appointing people on  their merits with the focus on concrete achievements in the work  of placement of demobilized officers, which is a very great  inspiration to demobilized officers as well as comrades still  serving in the Army.    In recent years, our party and government have been, as  always, making appropriate arrangements for demobilized officers  and bearing responsibility for them to the end, and the state  and local governments at all levels have invested a great deal  of manpower, materiel, and financial resources in this respect.  Taking housing as an example, the state, under a tight  financial situation, has successively increased subsidies for  building houses three times. Incomplete statistics show that a  total of 1.3 billion yuan of state subsidies have been granted  to various localities for building houses for demobilized  officers.    We cannot calculate, in detail, how much labor our society  has expended on the placement of demobilized officers. We can  only acclaim the work as a grand social project with Chinese  characteristics.    5. The time for restructuring the work of placement of  demobilized Army officers is becoming ripe, and the pace of  reform is gaining momentum.    The times are forging ahead and our society is undergoing  changes. Centering on the goal of establishing a socialist  market economic system set by the 14th CPC Congress, all trades  and professions are making more efforts in implementing their  reforms and accelerating the pace of reform. People are  particularly concerned about how to adjust the work of placement  of demobilized Army officers to the reform of the whole country  and how to introduce new measures of placement. Departments  concerned cannot, so far, furnish conclusive answers to these  questions, but we can see from a series of instructions issued  by leading comrades at the central level that the train of  thought in reforming the work of placement of demobilized Army  officers is very clear.    As far as the method of assignment is concerned, leading  comrades at the central level unequivocally point out:  Mandatory planning must undergo some changes and adapt itself  to the situation of market economy, but for some of the officers  who still fail to be assigned to new posts even after two-way  choices, the state must make arrangements for them. Never can  the state leave them out and make them fell abandoned by merely  laying stress on the market economy.    As far as work arrangement and living conditions are  concerned, leading comrades at the central level emphasize: No  matter how far our reform goes, our ultimate aim is to help  demobilized officers settle in their proper places and to ensure  that they can be assigned work commensurate with their  qualifications and competence. Their pay and fringe benefits  must be guaranteed.    As far as improvement of the quality of demobilized  officers is concerned, leaders of the Central Military  Commission point out time and again that we must conscientiously  implement a series of important instructions on training talents  capable of serving in the Army and in localities issued by  Comrade Deng Xiaoping. Early last year, Zhang Zhen, vice  chairman of the Central Military Commission, stressed when  inspecting the troops stationed in Fujian: We must strengthen  officers' on-the-job training and let them learn more scientific  and cultural knowledge and master certain economic and  management know-how so that they can adapt themselves to the  requirements of Army construction and can also meet the needs of  socialist modernization and have a certain level of competitive  power after transferring to civilian posts.    As far as legal construction is concerned, Vice Chairmen Liu  and Zhang of the Central Military Commission repeatedly point  out that we must begin with further establishing and perfecting  rules and regulations to dispel officers' worries in retirement  and placement and to gradually perfect the mechanism of  protection, thus enabling the work of placement of demobilized  Army officers to develop in a form involving law and system in a  standardized way.    At present, the time for restructuring the work of placement  of demobilized Army officers is becoming ripe, and the pace of  reform is gaining momentum. Let us look at the following pieces  of heartening news:    The State Council Work Group for Placement of Demobilized  Army Officers called a meeting on 2 March 1994, which decided  that we must pay great attention to drafting the "Interim  Regulations on the Work of Placement of Demobilized Army  Officers" and strive to complete it within this year.    This year, in order to meet the needs of making state  talents  mobile, restrictions on demobilized officers transferred to  civilian work will be relaxed. Demobilized officers stationed  in medium-sized and small cities along with their spouses are  allowed to be assigned to the same areas or nearby localities;  while some demobilized officers having specialized knowledge are  allowed to be assigned to other provinces and regions.    This year, we will further broaden placement channels and  perfect assignment methods to better serve personnel units and  create conditions for demobilized officers' voluntary job  selection.    This year, in order to adapt ourselves to the new situation  of reforming the Army and local pay system, we will draw up new  regulations on the method of transforming the pay scale of  demobilized officers on the principle of not allowing their pay  and fringe benefits to be lower than those enjoyed by local  cadres in corresponding grades.    Appropriate consideration will be given to demobilized  officers joining the contingent of state civil servants. For  demobilized officers at the regimental grade who join the  contingent of state civil servants, the method of selection and  transfer will be adopted; whereas for demobilized officers below  the battalion grade who enter party and government organs and  take up nonleadership posts below the director grade, only the  method of recruitment through examination will be tried among  officers transferred to civilian work within that year.    In order to gradually take the path of solving the housing  problems of demobilized officers through multiple channels and  forms, the State Council Work Group for the Placement of  Demobilized Army Officers and other departments concerned have  resorted to a number of methods on a trial basis in localities  with adequate conditions, including raising funds for building  houses in a coordinated manner, assigning them to civilian jobs  with housing allowances, encouraging them to build their own  houses while providing government assistance, and selling houses  to them on preferential terms.    All these situations show that as far as the work of  placement of demobilized Army officers is concerned, the policy  will become more and more perfect and the path will become  broader and broader.    Our dear comrade-in-arms, the CPC Central Committee, with  Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core, is concerned about demobilized  officers, who are welcomed by local party committees and  governments at all levels and the masses and needed by the  undertaking of socialist construction. There is no need for us  to worry about their "way out." On the contrary, we must fully  understand our state's problems, conscientiously submit  ourselves to the overall situation, and attach importance to our  people's interests. As long as we live up to our party's and  our people's ardent expectations, we must definitely be given  new fields to fully exhibit our talents and strengths on all  fronts of reform and opening up once we have fulfilled our task  of defense.    As far as the work of placement of demobilized Army officers  is concerned, an extraordinary decades-long course has been  traversed, with a good deal of effort made and great  achievements scored. We may be confronted with many new  situations and many new problems and have to shoulder heavy  responsibilities in the days to come. However, we firmly believe  that the work of placement of demobilized Army officers will  definitely have a brighter future.</p>

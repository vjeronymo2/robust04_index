			<p><P> September 3, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TOON TALK  </P> <P> Welcome Jo Yo: Mort Walker will celebrate the 40th anniversary of his comic  strip "Beetle Bailey" Tuesday by adding a new character to the staff at Camp  Swampy: Japanese-American Cpl.  </P> <P> Joe (Kashikoi) Yo. The character's middle name means "smart and clever" in  Japanese. "We felt the time had come to include an Asian-American in our cast,"  Walker said. When the strip premiered on Sept. 4, 1950, the title character in  "Beetle Bailey" was a goof-off college student; he mistakenly enlisted in the  Army during the Korean War and has remained in the service ever since.

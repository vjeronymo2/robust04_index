			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: Stores sector rallies Leading retail stocks were the market's best performers as they brushed aside negative weekend press comment and recent gloom over Christmas trading to move firmly ahead. One market watcher said the sector 'may have been oversold in recent sessions' while another observer said simply, 'I doubt things in the high Street are that bad.' Several stocks also benefited from programme trading and volume was lifted by agency crosses. Dealers also took comfort from favourable full-year figures from stores group Allders, and its positive comments on current trading, helping the shares add 5 to 204p. Among the leaders, Kingfisher, weakened by recent profit downgradings, was one of the day's strongest traders. The shares gained 4 to 420p. Marks &amp; Spencer also benefited from pre-Christmas bargain hunting, edging forward a half to close at 369 1/2 p. Hopes of another special dividend from Great Universal Stores helped the shares put 2 to 507p.</p>

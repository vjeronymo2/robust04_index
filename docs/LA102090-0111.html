			<p><P> October 20, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DESCRIPTION IS RELEASED OF NEWBORN FOUND DEAD  </P> <P> A newborn boy found dead in a commercial trash bin in Laguna Hills on Thursday  was a Caucasian with blond hair and blue eyes, authorities said Friday.  </P> <P> "We're saying that the baby was born (a healthy child) between midnight and 8  a.m. on Wednesday," said Lt. Robert Rivas, a sheriff's spokesman.  </P> <P> "He was dead for about a day (before he was found)."  </P> <P> Orange County coroner's officials performed an autopsy Friday on the infant,  who was found by a man who frequently picks through the dumpsters at the  Saddleback Business Complex just off Interstate 5 below the upscale homes of  Nellie Gail Ranch.  </P> <P> The man, who was not identified, called sheriff's investigators, who retrieved  the body from the trash bin. Witnesses said the child was wrapped in a white  cloth and partially covered by debris.  </P> <P> Rivas declined to reveal the cause of death, saying that the release of that  information could affect the homicide investigation.  </P> <P> He said that while homicide was a possible cause of death, the baby could have  died from overexposure.  </P> <P> "We're not ruling anything out," Rivas said. "We are handling it as a possible  homicide. But it could be natural causes; it could be accidental manslaughter  or homicide. We handle it to the extreme to make sure we cover all bases."  </P> <P> Rivas said investigators have few leads and are seeking the public's  assistance.  </P> <P> "We need help," he said, adding that the baby's mother has not been identified.  Rivas said that she may be seeking medical attention for possible hemorrhaging.  </P> <P> "We need any leads we can get," he said. "We are stressing the urgency."  </P> <P> Anyone with information should call detectives Rudy Garcia or Tim Carney at  (714) 647-7000.  </P></p>

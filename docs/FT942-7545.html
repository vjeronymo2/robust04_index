			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / Business and the Environment: Energy efficient tomatoes When Cantelo Nurseries, one of Britain's biggest tomato producers, wanted to save on its huge energy costs, it turned to the country with supreme expertise in glasshouse production - the Netherlands. Herman Van Den Ende, a Dutch consultant, was brought in to design an energy-efficient system for the Taunton-based glasshouse that produces 2m kilos of tomatoes a year. The system, which stores waste heat from day-time use to heat the tomato plants during the cooler night hours, won Cantelo a Pounds 500 award for energy management this week from Adas, the UK government's agricultural development and advisory service, as part of its campaign to cut the Pounds 320m annual energy bill on English farms. Horticulture accounts for by far the largest bills in the agricultural sector because of the high costs of heating greenhouses. Cantelo's annual energy bill amounts to just over Pounds 200,000, or about 30 per cent of its non-labour running costs. But Van Den Ende says this would have been 15 per cent higher before the installation of flue-gas condensers that are attached to the gas-fired water boilers to recapture most of the heat that would otherwise escape. Tomatoes need temperatures of about 20'F by day and 15'F at night. Because of the storage system, the nurseries can afford to burn more heat during the day to produce more of the carbon dioxide that the plants require to grow - and thus increase production. 'We should get a 5 to 10 per cent increase in yields,' says Kevin Hamilton, general manager. Smaller farms might not want to invest in new equipment to save energy, but that does not matter, according to Adas. 'Simple economy measures can lead to energy savings of 10 per cent or more,' says Gareth Ellis, energy consultant.</p>

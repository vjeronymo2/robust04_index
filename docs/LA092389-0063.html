			<p><P> September 23, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> USD SEEKS BEST START SINCE 1983  </P> <P> After two victories by a combined score of 43-6, the University of San Diego  has the opportunity to begin the season 3-0 for the first time since 1983.  </P> <P> USD plays at Claremont -- a school the Toreros have defeated each of the past  two years, including 17-8 in 1988 -- this afternoon at 1:30.  </P> <P> "We're playing well offensively, defensively and on special teams," USD Coach  Brian Fogarty said. "It's difficult to pinpoint any one area that has stood out  above the rest."  </P> <P> Fogarty figured that with seven starters returning from last season, the  offense would be much improved, and it has been. With a grind-it-out,  ball-control scheme, USD is averaging 329 yards per game (201 rushing, 128  passing), including 280 in last week's 19-0 victory over Whittier.  </P> <P> "Last year, 280 yards, I would have been very happy," Fogarty said. "But this  year I'm a little disappointed. I guess that shows what expectations can do."  </P> <P> On defense, USD is allowing only 142.5 yards per game, with just 65 of those  coming on rushes. Last year, USD set a school record allowing just 73 rushing  yards per game and held Claremont to minus one.  </P> <P> "I'm happy the defense has come around the way we thought it would. We knew we  had good players. It was just bringing them together in the right positions,"  Fogarty said.  </P> <P> Dave Bergmann kicked four field goals (23, 34, 40 and 46 yards) last week and  has made five of five on the year. Six in a row would equal the school record  set by Robert Lozzi in 1982.  </P> <P> Greg Frinell of Fallbrook High averaged 12 yards on five punt returns and had a  44-yard kickoff return last week.  </P> <P> Claremont is coming off a 10-8 opening loss to Menlo in which the Stags fumbled  for the fourth time on the Menlo one-yard line late in the fourth quarter.  </P> <P> USD linebacker Kurt Jafay will miss the remainder of the season with a neck  injury. Jafay has a year of eligibility remaining but is scheduled to graduate  this spring.  </P></p>

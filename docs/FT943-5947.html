			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / Japanese court backs Fujitsu on chip patent A Japanese court ruled yesterday that semiconductors made by Fujitsu, the Japanese electronics and computer manufacturer, do not infringe a patent covering the invention of the integrated circuit or semiconductor chip, which is held by Texas Instruments of the US. The ruling highlights the gap between the two countries in the interpretation and enforcement of patent rights in spite of a recent agreement to make their patent systems more compatible. The decision appears likely to increase friction between the US and Japan over intellectual property rights. A spokesman for the US trade representative said US trade officials were 'aware of and interested in the case'. Mr Richard Agnich, Texas Instruments' senior vice-president and general counsel, said the decision 'flies in the face of logic and justice'. The company would file an appeal, he said. The legal dispute goes back to 1991 when Fujitsu asked the court to declare that the 'Kilby' patent, named after the co-inventor of the semiconductor chip, does not apply to modern-day memory chips. Texas Instruments then sought an injunction to halt Fujitsu's manufacture and sale of memory chips. The Tokyo district court decided that Fujitsu's products did not infringe the Kilby patent on the ground that the patent covers old technology not being used today. For Texas Instruments, the decision is particularly onerous because the company has been fighting for its Kilby patent in Japan since 1959, when the company filed its application with the Japanese patent office. It took the US company close to 30 years, however, to win the patent, which was awarded in 1989 after opposition from Japanese companies. Japan has a 'first to file' patent system, unlike the US system, which is based on the principle of 'first to invent'. In addition, patents in Japan can be challenged before they are granted, whereas in the US opposing claims are filed after the patent is granted. 'We are deeply disturbed by a patent system that keeps a major invention tied up in the Japan patent office for 29 years, and, when the patent is issued, in effect claims that it covers old technology and does not pertain to products made today,' Mr Agnich said. Japanese courts have generally interpreted patents narrowly, enabling Japanese companies to obtain numerous 'improvement patents' covering related developments. Texas Instruments has already won licensing agreements for the Kilby patent, which expires in 2001, from 16 Japanese semiconductor makers. In addition to Fujitsu, Sanyo has also refused to license the patent although both companies have cross-licensing agreements with Texas for thousands of other patents. Yesterday's decision may affect renegotiations of cross-licensing agreements due next year. Texas Instruments said it was impossible to calculate the value of a single patent among the thousands that it held. In New York, Texas Instruments stock closed at Dollars 77 7/8 , down Dollars 4 5/8 on the day.</p>

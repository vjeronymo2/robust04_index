			<p>940816 FT  16 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Andrews Sykes net assets cut by Pounds 4m after valuation Andrews Sykes Group, the specialist industrial services company, announced yesterday that since the 1993-94 results were announced, on August 1, the result of an actuarial valuation of its UK pension schemes had been received resulting in a drop in the current surplus from Pounds 5.9m to Pounds 2.4m. The company said that the valuation reinforces the board's belief that it was inappropriate to bring this surplus onto the balance sheet, where it had been held since 1990, as it did not represent a readily available tangible asset. As a result, final results for the year will include a prior year adjustment to reflect a change of accounting policy, excluding the brought forward surplus from the balance sheet. The loss before tax of Pounds 4.7m and the gearing ratio of 256 per cent (excluding the surplus) are unchanged, but net assets at March 31 are reduced by Pounds 4m to Pounds 6.7m.</p>

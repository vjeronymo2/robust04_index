			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / Shell Oil move in US legal fight SHELL Oil has petitioned the California Appeals Court to re-hear some issues raised in its case with insurers who include underwriters at Lloyd's of London. The case concerns the cost of cleaning up pollution at the Rocky Mountain Arsenal site in Colorado where Shell makes pesticides. In the 1980s the US Environmental Protection Agency ordered the company to clean the site. Its insurers refused to meet the cost. The court ruled last month that Shell could not collect on insurance policies that it had bought after 1969, when insurers introduced a clause limiting coverage for pollution caused by 'sudden and accidental' release of pollutant. The judge referred to a lower court issues relating to coverage for pollution between 1952, when Shell started manufacturing pesticides at the plant, and 1969, opening the possibility that Shell might claim on its older policies.</p>

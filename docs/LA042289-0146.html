			<p><P> April 22, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 3RD OFFICER TO LEAVE;  </P> <P> SAFEGUARD EXECUTIVE RESIGNS, SELLS BACK STOCK  </P> <P> Larry Kay, a founder and a major stockholder in Safeguard Health Enterprises  Inc., has resigned as an officer and director of the Anaheim-based dental care  provider and has sold his stock back to the company for nearly $5 million.  </P> <P> Kay, who was a senior vice president and member of Safeguard's board, is the  third officer to leave the company in a little more than a year, the company  said.  </P> <P> Senior Vice President Ronald I. Brendzel said Kay, 56, had assumed fewer  responsibilities in recent years and chose to step down because he wanted to be  "semi-retired." Kay could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> One analyst said that in the past, executives have left the company partly  because of frustration caused by their working relationships with members of  the Baileys family, which controls Safeguard operations.  </P> <P> The family members include Safeguard Chairman Alvin M. Baileys; his son and  company President Dr. Steven J. Baileys, and Brendzel, who is related to the  Baileyses by marriage.  </P> <P> Dorothy E. Ryan, an analyst at the brokerage of Swergold &amp; Chefitz in San  Francisco, said managers from outside the family have found it difficult to  implement their own plans.  </P> <P> Safeguard, which has 830,000 members in dental plans in 13 states, reported  earnings of $3.4 million last year, a 17% increase over earnings for the  previous year. Revenue fell 4% to $67.8 million.  </P> <P> Aside from the elder Baileys, Kay was the last of the company's four founders  to have remained with the firm. Another founder left soon after the company was  formed in 1974; a second, in 1985.  </P> <P> Brendzel said Kay will remain with the company for 1 year as a consultant and  will be paid a figure that is "in line" with the $150,000 salary he received  last year.  </P> <P> Safeguard said it purchased Kay's 900,764 shares of company stock for $5.50 per  share. It said he received an initial payment of $3 million, with the rest to  be paid over the next 3 years with interest. The stock closed Friday at $5.50  per share, unchanged in over-the-counter trading.  </P> <P> Ryan said Safeguard's purchase of Kay's 17% stake may signify that the firm is  moving "little by little" toward a total buyout, which would transform it into  a privately owned company.  </P> <P> Including the purchase of Kay's shares, Safeguard has bought 3.5 million of the  8 million shares that were outstanding 3 years ago. Brendzel said 4.5 million  shares are now outstanding, with company officials holding about 39% of those.  He said there are no plans for the company to become private.  </P></p>

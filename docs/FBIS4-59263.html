			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Hayim Hecht] </F>   [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Addressing the Knesset plenum  today, Likud Chairman Binyamin Netanyahu announced: The day on  which the agreement with the PLO was signed was a dark day.  This document is a disaster, a historical mistake.    [Begin Netanyahu recording] Furtively, surreptitiously,  perfidiously, they are trying to divert the public's attention  from the signed-and-sealed next stage: Samaria and Judaea, the  Jordan Rift Valley and the eastern slopes of the Judaea  Mountains, as well as Jerusalem, whose turn to be united with  the PLO will come during this obsequious government's course of  action.    In Oslo, you envisioned the first stage of the Arab state  from the sea to the desert. In Washington, you signed an  agreement to love and cherish 'Arafat, the chairman of the  murder syndicate. And in Cairo, publicly degraded and  humiliated in a live broadcast aired to the entire world, you  signed the document of surrender. [end recording]    Rabin stared tiredly at Netanyahu, then waved his hand  dismissively and slowly uttered: Baloney. [passage omitted]</p>

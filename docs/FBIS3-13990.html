			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bengali </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Barun Sengupta: "American Official's Love of </F> Pakistan"]    [Excerpt] American Officials are gradually strengthening  their love for Pakistan. The anti-Indian component of this love  for Pakistan is apparent in their Kashmir policy.    The recent round of U.S. love for Pakistan began  intensifying  after Bhutto returned to power. U.S. expressions of love before  this were more subdued. Now, the United States is beating the  drums and openly offering its love. The United States supported  Pakistan at the time of the Bangladesh war. The United States  failed at that time to protest the extensive atrocities and  murders of civilians committed by the Pakistani army in  Bangladesh. On the contrary, the Pakistani military leaders  received assistance. After India defeated Pakistan in the  Eastern Theater of war [Bangladesh], the United States made all  types tof arrangements to assure that India would not advance on  the Western Theater [Pakistan]. The United States,though, had  not then openly supported Pakistani statements on Kashmir. Now  they are. They have stated that Kashmir cannot be considered an  indisputible part of India. The United States is not even  prepared to recognize the part of Kashmir under Indian control  as a part of India. Their position is that all of Kashmir is  disputed territory.    Apart from that, recently, the U.S. Government has shed a  lot  of tears over Kashmir and how the Indian Government has curbed  Kashmiri rights and is committing atrocities. Even Clinton is  claiming how pained he is over all this. The reason the U.S.  Government has suddenly become agitated over Kashmir is its  newfound love for Pakistan. If U.S. officials were not under  pressure to appease Pakistan, then why would they be crying so  much? The main reason for their tears is to avoid criticism by  Pakistan and the Muslim world.    There is no doubt that democracy is deep-rooted in American  society. They do not want to see people deprived of democratic  rights. Americans become very agitated upon hearing that human  rights are being violated and governments are torturing their  people. But there is no reason to believe that the U.S.  Government is fond of human rights. U.S. foreign policy is based  on American economic interests. They show interest in the  abrogation of human rights when American economic interests are  involved. When these interests are involved, they make a hue and  cry all over the world.    There are many examples of this in history. Despite this,  the  United States continues on this path. One example is when the  United States some time back made a big fuss over human rights  violations in China. Now they have shut up. They are worried  about losing markets in China. Thus the United States simply  cannot worry about the lack of progress in human rights there.    U.S. officials never raise the subject of Saudi Arabia's  lack  of democracy or how torture is practiced there. This is due to  the Saudis' willingness to keep in mind U.S. economic interests.  When Khomeyni took power in Iran, however, U.S. officials became  worried due to his unwillingness to protect U.S. interests as  had the Shah. [passage omitted giving other examples]    Now, the United States is suddenly worried about Kashmir!  The  concern shown by the United States over human rights violations,  however, is really an expression of concern over economic  interests there. The United States wants to establish economic  domination over Pakistan and needs a military base in Kashmir.  Thus, the United States is about to restore aid to Pakistan. The  United States wants to take steps to appease Pakistan and the  Muslim world.    U.S. officials regard the Kashmir problem as a religious  issue for most of the world's Muslims, a jihad to free Muslims  from Kafirs. They believe that world Muslim sentiment is  involved in this matter. This is why the United States is  supporting the Pakistan position.    This explains why U.S. officials are silent over the support  for militants which Pakistan offers year after year, creating a  nightmare in the region. They have not uttered a word about  about the atrocities committed by Pakistani militants in  Kashmir. They have not uttered a word about the pitiful plight  of Hindus and Buddhists who have been driven from  Muslim-majority areas. This despite being the same U.S.  officials who threatened Pakistan with terrorist-state  designation just some time ago.    The question arises, why is the United States such a lover  of  Pakistan and appeaser of Muslims? There are many reasons.    First, the United States wants a military base in Kashmir in  order to keep an eye on the oil-exporting regions of the  Middle-East and Russia. U.S. economic interests in these regions  is vital. A military installation would allow U.S. planes and  military forces to be rapidly deployed in support of U.S.  interests.    The United States is very worried about miltant Islam. They  view with alarm the regime in Tehran. They know that anti-U.S.  sentiment amongst Muslims is still very high after the Gulf War.  The Muslim World is not content with simply being regional in  scope, they want a place on the world stage. The United States  is willing to appease this wish to gain the support of the  majority of Muslims.    The United States, by allowing the Muslim world to grow  stronger, also creates a check on Russia, India, and China.  Thus, these countries will not be able to oppose U.S. economic  imperialism.    This is why I have written that U.S. tears shed for Kashmir  are not due to human rights violations. They are shed with a  view to advancing U.S. economic interests.  *</p>

			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / Danish unions alter course Tradition and values in the Danish trade union movement are undergoing radical change, according to a membership study published by the Confederation of Danish Trade Unions, writes Hilary Barnes in Copenhagen. Some 77 per cent of trade unionists attach more importance to having an interesting job and a good working environment (77 per cent) than to high wages (33 per cent). Strikes and labour conflict are supported by only 8 per cent of the 3,390 members in the survey. The vast majority believed labour problems should be resolved through negotiation.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Samed Mansurov: "In War as in War"] </F>   [Text] I was here before the war and my recollections  connected with peaceful Karabakh are beautiful. Today, however,  they are only recollections. There is no return to the past, as  there is no road to Agdam, which, in fact, has also not existed  for several months.    We turn in the direction of the headquarters of the Agdam  brigade. Regular buses taken off routes for soldiers'  transportation pass on the road. Tomorrow a young replacement  will join the battle. The column of the battalion medical  station, which has thundered past us in the direction of the  front line, smells of war. The buses remind us of the city.    In the barracks of the Agdam brigade, officers sleep on the  floor and soldiers have forgotten what bed linen and blankets  are. After a meager supper in the soldiers' mess one does not  want to think about anything else but sleep. Here, at the very  front line, this is a luxury, because the lice, with which the  barracks are teeming, are not asleep.    In this war senseless victims (if, in general, it is  appropriate to talk about any sense) are in the order of things.  On the Azerbaijani side up to 90 percent of the losses are the  consequence of the low level of combat training of both soldiers  and officers. One colonel complained to me that from among the  commanders subordinate to him no one knew how to handle even a  compass. Despair is heard in the voice of the former Soviet Army  officer, an Azerbaijani, who has served in Ukraine for 20 years.    Things are even worse with soldiers. Adolescents, who have  barely left school, receive weapons almost in trenches. If a  cartridge suddenly becomes jammed in the breech during combat,  the weapon becomes a useless piece of iron, because no one has  taught the soldier how to take the Kalashnikov assault rifle  apart and clean it. After the command "attack" soldiers maintain  the correct direction of motion for no more than about 10 meters  and then disperse in different directions like blind cats.    We arrived at the front line before the very beginning of  the  Armenian attack. The enemy tank was stopped one meter from the  defense line--it almost overran the trench. A grenade hit the  track and the T-72 rolled back downhill. If not for this lucky  accident, both the defenders and we, journalists, would be in a  bad way. Later soldiers tried to determine who fired more  accurately. The most accurate grenade launcher operator can  expect a reward of 2 million rubles.    What even the youngest cannot be denied is the desire to  win.  However, desire alone is not enough. "It is easy to be killed  and this is by no means always heroism," says a young  lieutenant--a battalion commander. "A soldier deserves more  glory if he wins and remains alive." He did not want to remember  how a unit of the second battalion tried to leave the position  during the attack. The commander stopped them with shots into  the air.    Soldiers are killed not only in battle. Quite recently 27  young combat engineers were blown up by an antitank mine during  a training exercise. The commander explained to them the  principle of fuze operation and forgot that in front of him  there was a real, not training, mine. My friend was killed last  year: During dinner the barracks was wiped off the face of the  earth, because someone carelessly unloaded ammunition nearby.    Some battalions have been sitting in trenches since the  summer of 1993, when Armenian forces scored several crushing  victories in succession. The offensive was stopped thanks to a  corps of Afghan mujahidin. In the middle of January of this year  Afghans also liberated Goradiz, a strategically important  station on the Iranian-Azerbaijani border. The Mujahidin act  autonomously, coordinating only the most necessary details with  the Azerbaijani command. An Afghan soldier receives up to 10,000  U.S. dollars per month. Legends are composed about Mujahidin in  Beylagan, where their headquarters are located. People say that  one Tajik-Afghan (the majority of those fighting in Azerbaijan  are Tajiks) can handle a tank: He jumps up onto the armor with a  pail of dirt and blocks its vision devices. The subsequent  extraction of the crew from the tank is a technical matter. The  Mujahidin bring prisoners from missions in packs. If they seize  Russians fighting on the Armenian side, they do not hand them  over to the Azerbaijani military. Afghans have iron discipline,  although they scorn conventions such as uniforms, drill  training, and so forth. On a road in Beylagan we picked up four  Mujahidin, who mastered the Azerbaijani language to such an  extent that they were able to explain where to bring them and to  thank us at parting. The day before our 25-year old traveling  companions seized Goradiz. An Azerbaijani girl, who was a  medical corpswoman, told me later that several corpses of women  snipers--according to rumors, either Lithuanians or French--were  found in the city ruins. All the women's throats were cut. "One  of them had very beautiful hair," the girl said. After this  story the driver of the microbus refused to drive us to Goradiz.    After the series of defeats last year the desertion of  Azerbaijani soldiers assumed a catastrophic scale. President  Aliyev's edict promised amnesty to those who ran away if they  returned to their units before 10 January 1994. A few days  before the expiration of this date crowds of deserters and their  parents gathered in front of the entrance to the Ministry of  Defense in Baku, trying to find out in the personnel  administration where the units were located. The number of those  who repented tripled after the decree of the military tribunal,  which sentenced two deserters to execution by a firing squad,  was published in the Azerbaijani press.    The prospects for the return of deserters do not gladden  soldiers. The fighters think that, having run away once, they  will also run away for the second and third time. "When the war  ends, I am sure to meet one of them," says the bearded sergeant  with a bandaged head. "I know what I will do then... If I stay  alive." Soldiers in trenches do not consider deserters to be  Azerbaijanis.    With the exception of several elite subunits in the  Azerbaijani National Army there are no units capable of  performing serious combat missions. Assault battalions and  special forces, basically, consist of professional servicemen,  former members of the special-purpose militia detachment. They  are too few to alter the course of the war in a short time and  to forget about the most serious destruction of Azerbaijani  arms, which has led to a revision of the political course and  change of the republic's leadership.    Moscow has never denied that the Transcaucasus is a zone of  special interests of Russian foreign policy. However, until now  Russian politicians have not brought themselves to acknowledge  their indirect (or direct) participation in the  Armenian-Azerbaijani war. Meanwhile, Russia's military aid to  Armenia has never been a secret to those let in on it. In  Yerevan the seventh combined-arms army of Russia's Armed Forces,  which was later transformed into three mobile brigades modeled  after American quick-response forces, was used either as a  shield, or according to the direct purpose. Suffice it to recall  the tank attack on Fizuli and the bombing of Azerbaijani  settlements from the air by aircraft, which Armenia does not  have.    With Aliyev's coming to power Baku's situation seemingly has  changed for the better. A draft of the Azerbaijani-Russian  agreement on military cooperation, which, probably, will be  signed in the very near future, has caught my eyes. A compromise  has finally been reached on the matter of joint operation of the  former Soviet--and now no man's--center of radioelectronic  reconnaissance in Gabal in the north of Azerbaijan, which is the  largest in Europe. In exchange for concessions Russia  transferred to Azerbaijan several dozens of the latest  "Shturm-S" antitank systems and, at the same time, specialists  as well, who will teach Azerbaijani servicemen how to handle  fine equipment. The results of backstage negotiations between  Azerbaijani political leaders and the Russian military will make  themselves felt in spring, when the weather makes it possible to  activate combat operations around Karabakh.    In all, about 100 Russian military specialists now serve  under contract in the Azerbaijani Army. Most of them have  arrived here at the beginning of the current year. This is the  result of the secret mission, on which a group of Azerbaijani  recruiting officers departed from Baku to Russia at the end of  December 1993. In the military commissariats of Moscow, Ivanovo,  Yaroslavl, Nizhniy Novgorod, and other Russian cities  Azerbaijanis obtained access to the service records of reserve  servicemen: Some of them agreed to serve in the Azerbaijani  Army. The republic's armed forces are experiencing an acute  shortage of air defense, artillery, and other specialists.  Russian military specialists do not (or hardly) take part in  combat operations.    Nadzhmedlin Sadykhov, chief of the General Staff of the  Azerbaijani National Army, is surrounded by Russian military  specialists. Colonel Aleksandr Vasyak, chief of the Operations  Directorate of the Ministry of Defense, who was invited from  Russia, formulates and directs the activities of the Azerbaijani  Army all over the front. At the headquarters of the Agdam  brigade, Colonel Vasyak's eloquent expressions before a  formation of Azerbaijani officers about the lackadaisical  attitude of the latter made me give up the idea of asking the  colonel a few questions.    Major Gribanov, chief of staff of x-brigade, came to  Azerbaijan from Murmansk, leaving his wife and three children  there. He is fighting for his homeland. The Russian Major  considers it to be Azerbaijan, where he has lived for more than  1 year. Mikhail Vasilyevich says: "I am the same Azerbaijani as  all of them. Sometimes I tell my children that I am a better  Moslem than they are, although I am not circumcised. If  necessary, I will die here."</p>

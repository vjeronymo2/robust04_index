			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Aleksandar Milosevic: "Lost Sheep"] </F>   [Text] Although nonbinding, the resolution of the U.S.  Senate demanding the lifting of the arms embargo against the  Bosnian Muslims is more than telling. First of all it reveals  the prevalent way of thinking in this leading U.S. institution  regarding the solution to the Bosnia-Herzegovina conflict. The  U.S. Senate obviously believes that a political solution is  impossible, and so the military solution imposes itself.  Additionally, this resolution confirms that -- out of narrow  internal interests -- the United States wants to radicalize its  behavior in order to appease its allies in the Islamic and Arab  world.    Both these facts, however, show that there is a large rift  in  interests and intentions between Europe and the United States  when it comes to solving the crisis on the territory of the  former Yugoslavia. While the European Union, divided over the  national interests of France, Great Britain, and Germany -- and  in the shadow of Russian diplomatic moves -- is trying in vain  to find a common denominator for its policy, the United States  is trying to move things with loud threats of air strikes and  now of lifting the arms embargo against Alija Izetbegovic's  army. However, it is hard to believe that the real way will be  found with such diversified interests. The European West and  the United States still resemble lost sheep far more than a  respectable political force.    Although one should not, in principle, draw parallels with  the past for day to day political events, one should  nevertheless say that the U.S. Senate did not pass such a  resolution, or indeed any resolution, binding or otherwise, when  Croatia was the victim of the Serbian aggression. Besides, the  arms that Alija Izetbegovic would get with the lifting of the  embargo would, at least initially, be used exclusively against  the Croats in central Bosnia and the Neretva River valley. That  is why Croatia cannot remain calm and unconcerned in the face of  the latest resolution of the U.S. Senate.</p>

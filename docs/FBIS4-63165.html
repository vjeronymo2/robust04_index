			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Aleksandrova] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 19 TASS -- President Boris Yeltsin plans  no major reshuffling of the government although he assesses some  spheres of its activities as unsatisfactory, according to  presidential spokesman Vyacheslav Kostikov.    "The president does not intend to follow the practice which  is usual for such situations in the West and will not put the  blame on the partner by reshuffling or changing the cabinet",  the spokesman told reporters on Thursday.    "Nothing radical is in store", he stressed and said that  rumours about a possible dismissal of Privatisation Minister  Anatoliy Chubays are "inventions and bluff".    But Kostikov admitted that the president had expressed  "serious remarks" to Viktor Chernomyrdin during their 6-hour  long meeting on Tuesday because of poor implementation of  presidential decrees and economic decisions.    However, "the president and the prime minister act in a  coordinated way and there is no talk about a crisis of trust  between them", according to Kostikov.    "There are serious remarks, tough criticism on the part of  the president. The actions of the government are assessed by  the president as unsatisfactory in a number of aspects, but  there is no misunderstanding", he stressed.    After the signing of the Civic Accord Treaty the president  and the government "acquired a sufficient degree of political  confidence which allows them not to hide disagreements which  exist between them. In conditions of a greater stability there  is a possibility to raise questions in a sharper way without  fearing they would affect the political situation", Kostikov  said.</p>

			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / Asbestos negligence A US JURY yesterday found six companies negligent in the nation's largest consolidation of asbestos personal injury claims, AP reports from Baltimore. The companies found liable for making or selling asbestos-containing products were GAF, Keene, Pittsburgh Corning, AC and S, MCIC, and Porter-Hayden. Several other companies settled with plaintiffs. The four-month trial consolidated nearly 8,555 asbestos claims in Maryland and was closely watched as part of an attempt to whittle down a nationwide backlog of asbestos claims. The trial will now proceed to its second phase, where the jury will decide on liability for compensatory and punitive damages. More than 60,000 cases are pending in state courts elsewhere throughout the nation, and 26,000 other cases have been frozen in federal courts pending an attempt to resolve pre-trial issues and speed cases.</p>

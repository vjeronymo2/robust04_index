			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Eleco deficit amounts to Pounds 4.8m ELECO Holdings, the building products and specialist contracting group, incurred a pre-tax deficit of Pounds 4.82m for the 12 months to June 30. The outcome, struck on turnover which was down from Pounds 50.3m to Pounds 47.9m, in-cluding Pounds 453,000 from acquisitions and Pounds 1.63m from dis-continued operations, compared with losses of Pounds 6.08m last time, restated under FRS 3. Mr Field Walton, the chairman, pointed out that the result for the period was adversely affected by rationalisation and reorganisation costs both in the UK and overseas. There was an exceptional charge for the 12 months of Pounds 1.1m for the write-back of goodwill on the disposal of its Ecometal operation and, as announced at the interim stage, a provision of Pounds 1.37m against costs of discontinuing the property development activities. Group bank borrowings fell from Pounds 15.4m to Pounds 11.9m over the year and have since dipped further to about Pounds 8.8m. Losses per share were 15.7p (20p).</p>

			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / International Company News: BAT looks again at Dollars 1bn deal - American Tobacco acquisition in jeopardy after FDA accusations BAT Industries, the UK tobacco and insurance group, yesterday warned that its Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) acquisition of American Tobacco could be jeopardised by the increasingly aggressive attitude of the US Food and Drug Administration. The warning follows accusations last week by Mr David Kessler, FDA commissioner, that a US subsidiary of BAT had secretly developed a form of tobacco with high nicotine content through genetic engineering. Mr Kessler's allegations were part of a campaign by the FDA to gain regulatory control of the tobacco industry. Mr Michael Prideaux, director of public affairs at BAT, said: 'If the FDA takes control of tobacco regulation and introduces closet prohibition - by stopping the sale of cigarettes containing nicotine or banning cigarettes that generate smoke - that could have a material impact on the results of American Tobacco.' The contract between BAT and American Brands, the diversified US owner of American Tobacco, contains a material adverse change clause, according to BAT. This allows BAT to cancel the deal - though not change the price - if the results of American Tobacco, the US's fifth largest tobacco group, deteriorate significantly. 'We will be looking carefully at American Tobacco's next few quarters,' said Mr Prideaux. The deal is scheduled to be concluded by April 1995. The acquisition, currently being investigated by the Federal Trade Commission, would increase BAT's sales by about 50 per cent, raising its share of the US cigarette market from 11 per cent to 18 per cent. BAT is already the US's third biggest cigarette manufacturer. Mr Thomas Sandefur, chairman of BAT's subsidiary, Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco, last week accused Mr Kessler of leading 'a dangerous crusade' to advance his 'personal and political agenda' of banning tobacco products. 'We don't expect Mr Kessler to succeed in his agenda - the tobacco industry is already tightly regulated. But it's a worrying development,' said Mr Prideaux. Any attempt to pull out of the acquisition would probably lead to litigation with American Brands, he admitted. When the deal was announced BAT already knew the US tobacco market was in trouble. Competition has become increasingly fierce since Philip Morris, the market leader, cut the price of its Marlboro brand last year.</p>

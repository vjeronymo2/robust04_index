			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / Seriously Rich: Brazil - the beautiful and the damned / Christina Lamb describes trillionaire life in the country with the biggest gap between rich and poor BRAZIL is perhaps the only country in the world where the entire working populace are millionaires. Unfortunately, most are also poor. With a million cruzeiros now worth Dollars 25, to be seriously rich in Brazil one must have a good few trillion stashed away. And plenty such people exist. Forget the Brazil of economic crises, growing slums, ailing Indians and Dollars 2,000 per capita income. Instead, welcome to the country which is second only to the US in purchase of private jets and where high society is so flourishing that the Association of Columnists boasts more than 500 working members and even the Journal of Commerce has a large gossip column. Wealth is flaunted. At one favourite hangout, Leopoldos, in Sao Paulo, diners watch images of themselves and other customers projected on to a giant videoscreen, enabling close scrutiny of who is wearing what and flirting with whom. In tropical Rio, fur wraps are de rigueur for true socialites. These are the authentic beautiful and the damned. 'Beautiful' because in the world capital of plastic surgery, nobody with money is allowed to retain nature's imperfections. Nose jobs, face lifts, bottom tucks, cellulite removal, breast implants - the decision is not if but when the next cut should come. Ivo Pitanguy is Brazil's high priest of plastic surgery; fittingly, he has become a member of the serious rich himself, owning an island south of Rio. 'Damned' because Brazil has the world's biggest income gap between rich and poor - a contrast particularly obvious in Rio, where luxury apartments rub shoulders with sprawling slums. Already the crime rate is so high that even the only-slightly-rich live behind bars protected by armies of security guards and drive bullet-proof cars. Sometimes, sipping cocktails on their penthouse terraces, rich Brazilians look at the lights of the surrounding slums and wonder how long before the masses swarm upon them, demanding justice. Meantime, they are having a ball. 'The Brazilian elite are like a bunch of people having a wild champagne party on a boat which is heading towards the edge of Niagara Falls,' says a World Bank official. The day starts late for Brazil's seriously rich. For the women it begins with exercises or a jog along the beach, followed by a light lunch at a restaurant such as Antiquarius to discuss the events of the previous night. Then it is a trip to the hair salon, perhaps tea at the Copacabana Palace, then home to prepare for a party or dinner at one of Rio's classy French restaurants - Le Bec Fin, Claude Troisgros or Le Meridien. For the younger set, preferred hangouts are Banana cafe or Gattopardos, followed by dancing at Hippopotamus. Weekends are spent messing about on boats, jetskis and microlites in the coastal resorts of Angra dos Reis or Buzios, or horse-riding in the mountains of Petropolis. There are also frequent trips to the requisite fazenda in the country, and to Miami, New York and Paris where rich Brazilians descend on fashion houses like Chanel and Balenciaga, practising the French that it is so chic to speak at home. Although Brazil's security problems have caused a few of the rich to flee permanently, most return. According to Jeff Thomas, a leading society writer: 'They love to see their names in the papers; abroad, they are not celebrities.' There is nothing like being rich in a developing country. Even the moderately well-off can maintain armies of servants, including white-uniformed nannies to walk the baby and handlers to exercise the dog. And while strict import laws meant that, until recently, some trappings of wealth, such as cell phones and smart cars, were unobtainable, even for the richest, they could still live like kings. Behind the high brick walls surrounding the estate of 'Baby' Monteiro de Carvalho, one of Rio's most favoured sons, you encounter mansion after mansion (one for each of his children) on the long drive until finally reaching the colonnaded main house, which is like something out of a de Mille movie. Brazilian governments have seemed exclusively interested in improving the lot of the rich, preferring to spend money on subsidies and incentives for large industry and agriculture rather than social welfare. Monopolies have been protected, land reform carefully skirted. The coffee and sugar barons of the past have been replaced by industrialists, media moguls and bankers, the latter scooping profits from the soaring inflation rate. Owners of construction companies have also grown rich from huge development projects at inflated costs which are responsible for much of the Third World's largest foreign debt. Proving that crime pays in Brazil, the serious rich also include a fair number of organised crime bosses, plus corrupt politicians and officials. Former president Fernando Collor and his frontman, P C Farias, transformed from a used car salesman to a multi-millionaire, have not let disgrace interfere with their lifestyles. Orestes Quercia, who recently resigned as head of Brazil's largest political party, is alleged to have built a fortune of as much as Dollars 1bn during stints as governor of Sao Paulo. In spite of Brazil's social apartheid, the serious rich do not let themselves be troubled by such things as conscience. You will rarely catch the rich wives of Rio dirtying their hands in good works. As one society woman told me: 'The poor are always robbing us, my dear, so why should we give them money ?'</p>

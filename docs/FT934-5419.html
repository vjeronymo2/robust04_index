			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: A franchise for the future on British Rail's name Sir, I was most interested to read ('50-year rail franchises urged', November 23) that Mr Roger Salmon, franchising director, wants to see rail franchisees set up an association of train-operating companies to take a lead in discussing issues such as complementary ticket systems and sharing of stations. May I suggest British Rail as a good name for such an association. Alan D Morrison, 5 Pentney Road, London SW12 0NZ</p>

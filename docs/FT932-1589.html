			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / Hopes of steady recovery boosted: GDP rise 0.2 points higher than thought HIGHER CONSUMER spending and strong export growth has led to a sharp upward revision in economic activity, underlining hopes for a steady recovery later this year. Output in the first quarter was helped by the biggest six-monthly fall for eight years in the proportion of consumer incomes directed to saving, and by buoyant service-company investments. The Central Statistical Office said yesterday that excluding oil and gas extraction, gross domestic product in the first quarter grew by an inflation-adjusted, year-on-year 0.9 per cent, up from an earlier estimate of 0.7 per cent. The savings ratio - consumer savings as a percentage of total disposable income - fell to 10.3 per cent in the first quarter from 11.3 per cent in the last quarter of 1992 and 12.1 per cent in the third quarter. This large six-monthly fall was helped by lower interest rates reducing the incentive for people to save. It released more cash for spending on goods and services. Excluding energy production, GDP expanded 0.7 per cent in the first quarter, compared with the final quarter of last year. This was in line with earlier estimates. Total quarter-on-quarter GDP growth in the first three months is put at 0.4 per cent, up from the initial estimate of 0.2 per cent two months ago. As a result of new data government statisticians reckon the economic decline in the first half of last year was steeper than originally thought. They have revised upwards their growth figures for the second half. This means the recession is officially thought to have bottomed out about spring of last year, with total GDP including oil and gas having expanded in both the third and fourth three-monthly periods at a quarter-on-quarter 0.3 per cent. GDP in the first quarter was up 0.9 per cent compared with the same quarter a year before. Economic activity in the first quarter was helped by the pound's devaluation boosting exports of goods and services. These grew 3.3 per cent from the previous quarter and 6 per cent from a year previously. Imports of goods and services expanded less, by 1.9 per cent and 3.6 per cent respectively. Consumer spending rose 0.5 per cent between the fourth quarter of 1992 and the January-March period. Spending on durable goods rose 1 per cent, while spending on energy fell 4.3 per cent due to mild weather. Real personal disposable income fell 0.6 per cent between the two quarters, partly reflecting a fall in employment and lower social security payments.</p>

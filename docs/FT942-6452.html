			<p>940530 FT  30 MAY 94 / FT Guide to the Week MONDAY 30 Franco-German summit A two-day Franco-German summit begins in Mulhouse, France, between President Francois Mitterrand and Chancellor Helmut Kohl. They are expected to commit themselves to a common European Union programme for their consecutive presidencies over the next 12 months, beginning with the German term in July. Job creation, opening the market to eastern Europe, and making the Maastricht treaty work are key themes. They must also agree on a favoured candidate for the future presidency of the European Commission, to be finalised at the EU summit in Corfu. Mad cow fever: European Union agriculture ministers meet in Brussels today and tomorrow to discuss farm prices and how to respond to German pressure to ban all imports of British beef because of the risk of BSE, or mad cow disease. Crimea: An ultimatum from Ukrainian president Leonid Kravchuk (below) for the Crimean parliament to reverse its virtual declaration of independence runs out today. On May 20, the parliament decided to adopt a separate constitution for the peninsula, whose population is more than two-thirds Russian and which was part of Russia until 1954. The move was regarded as a prelude to secession. Ukraine has moved in national guardsmen and armoured personnel carriers, but has also opened a dialogue with Crimea's parliamentarians and sworn to eschew violence. East Timor is the subject of a conference being held in Manila, capital of the Philippines (to June 4). The meeting, organised by private groups, is to debate Indonesia's 1976 annexation of the former Portuguese colony and alleged human-rights abuses on the island. Telecoms ministers from the European Union meet in Brussels to discuss among other things trans-European data highways, and a discussion paper on mobile telephones. Croatian currency: Croatia is from today, Croatian Statehood Day, reviving the kuna, the currency used by the Nazi puppet Ustashe regime of the second world war. The kuna, which is replacing the Croatian dinar introduced at independence in 1991, will be pegged to the D-Mark at the rate of 4 kunas to 1 D-Mark. Holidays: UK (Spring Bank Holiday), US (Memorial Day); Congress is in recess all week. TUESDAY 31 Bank of Italy annual report Antonio Fazio (below), the governor of the Bank of Italy, presents his annual report on the economic and financial state of the country. Mr Fazio's statement, his second in office, is keenly awaited as the key indicator of how the bank assesses the policy options of the Berlusconi government. The report will also be read for any hint that the bank might fear political interference from a government which does not necessarily see eye to eye with Mr Fazio and his team. Algeria meets its chief western creditors in Paris to discuss the terms under which it will reschedule that part of its Dollars 14.5bn foreign debt owed to foreign governments. Germany's leading industry association, the Bundesverband der Deutschen Industrie, will consider the outlook for German industry at its annual assembly in Bonn. Chancellor Helmut Kohl and other leading politicians will address the gathering. Guatemala talks: Representatives of the Guatemalan government and guerrillas meet in Oslo for peace talks (to June 4). UK economy: The release of May's narrow money supply figures is likely to fuel debate about inflationary pressures in the UK economy. The market predicts that M0, which largely measures notes and coins in circulation, grew by 7.1 per cent in May, measured year on year, compared to 6.2 per cent in April. Government officials point out this rise partly reflects strong retail sales and low interest rates. But with M0 growth running well above the government's target range of 0-4 per cent, a large monthly jump will intensify speculation about future monetary tightening. Non-Aligned Movement: Foreign ministers of the Non-Aligned Movement gather in Egypt for a meeting expected to focus on the fighting in Bosnia and Rwanda and to set out plans to tackle the economic problems of developing nations. The ministers are likely to decide on whether to grant official guest status to Russia. Belgrade has been excluded from the meeting. Light up at your peril: Today is World No Tobacco Day. FT Surveys: German Banking and Finance and The Computer Industry: The Battle for the Desktop. Holidays: South Africa (Republic Day). WEDNESDAY 1 UN names pleasantest land The United Nations Development Programme publishes its fifth annual Human Development Report, which aims to measure quality of life rather than simply economic growth. Its core is the Human Development Index, ranking 173 countries by a measure that combines life expectancy, educational standards and basic purchasing power. Canada is expected to be ranked first. Its appearance is timed to coincide with the start of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development at the World Bank headquarters in Washington, DC. German economy: With the markets increasingly pessimistic about the chance of a further interest rate cut from the Bundesbank, April's output figures are likely to be watched for signs of the recession bottoming out. The markets expect to see industrial production up 0.4 per cent in April, after falling 0.8 per cent in March. Although a recent survey showed German business confidence had also risen in April, many analysts remain doubtful about the strength of any pick-up. George Walker, former chairman and chief executive of Brent Walker, the heavily indebted leisure and property group, and Wilfred Aquilina, former group finance director, go on trial at Southwark Crown Court, south-east London, charged with conspiracy, theft of Pounds 12.5m from the company and false accounting. Euro poll: Europeans have become increasingly ambivalent - not to say Eurosceptical - about the goal of political and monetary union enshrined in the Maastricht treaty. Just over a week before the elections for the European parliament on June 9 and 12, an FT opinion poll across all 12 EU countries provides a wide-ranging survey of Europeans' feelings and forecasts about the future of the continent. The poll, carried out in association with seven other European newspapers, throws light on divergences in European attitudes on the widening and deepening of the EU. D-Day anniversary: US President Bill Clinton leaves Washington for his second European trip of the year, pegged to the D-Day commemorations but with room for political business on the side. His first stop will be Italy. Racing: The Derby is run at Epsom, south of London. Holidays: Kenya (Madaraka Day). THURSDAY 2 Bosnia factions at UN talks Serb, Croat and Moslem leaders meet in Geneva for talks on a comprehensive ceasefire in Bosnia (to June 3). It is understood that the warring factions could be prepared to sign a four-month, Bosnia-wide ceasefire. This would be likely to entail interposing UN troops between the combatants, the creation of a buffer zone and withdrawal of heavy weapons. Last week, Bosnian Serb forces agreed to allow UN observers to patrol freely in the heavy weapons exclusion zone around the Moslem town of Gorazde in eastern Bosnia. Chambers of Commerce: About 500 executives gather in Birmingham for the British Chambers of Commerce annual conference (to June 3). The main concern is the impact on profitability of outside factors such as the environment, finance and, of course, government, European and economic policy. Speakers include foreign secretary Douglas Hurd and secretary of state for trade and industry Michael Heseltine (above). Education: John Patten, UK education secretary, risks humiliation when he addresses the annual conference of the National Association of Head Teachers at Eastbourne today. Last year, he was booed, hissed and heckled at the conference, which coincided with the height of the controversy over national curriculum tests. A year later, there are signs of increasing anger among heads over new requirements for teaching religious education, while the indications are that only marginally more tests were taken in secondary schools this year. Children's rights: Romanian government hosts a conference in Bucharest with UN and Save the Children. India: bank staff plan two-day strike. FT Surveys: Belgium and Foreign Exchange. Belgium's political and business leaders are regaining their confidence after a year in which the prime objective was to ride out the country's worst recession for 60 years. Cricket: England plays New Zealand in the first Test at Trent Bridge (to June 6). Holidays: Austria, Brazil, Chile, parts of Germany, Portugal (Corpus Christi). FRIDAY 3 FDP annual conference Germany's ailing Free Democratic Party gathers in Rostock, on the Baltic coast, where Klaus Kinkel, party leader and foreign minister, will try to revive his troops. The party is in danger of failing to win any seats in the European elections on June 12, and ending up too weak in October's general election to perform its traditional role of king-maker in the ruling coalition. World Environment Day sees the UK hosting a conference on the United Nations environment programme at the Queen Elizabeth II Conference Centre in London. The Global 500 environmental awards will be presented. Lloyd Bentsen, US Treasury secretary will deliver 'a major policy speech' at a lunch hosted by the Confederation of British Industry in London. It will touch on world trade, foreign investment in the US and current US economic policy. D-Day anniversary: US president Bill Clinton in Italy to meet the Berlusconi government and Pope John Paul, and attend commemorations of the Anzio and Nettuno allied landings during the second world war. WEEKEND 4-5 OAS general assembly The 34 members of the Organisation of American States gather on Sunday in the northern Brazilian city of Belem (to June 10). On the agenda are democracy and human rights, environmental issues, drugs and the region's economy. Inhuman rites: A protest March leaves Oxford on Saturday for nearby Campsfield detention centre, where would-be immigrants can be held indefinitely while it is decided whether they have a right to enter the UK. Motor racing: Isle of Man Tourist Trophy races start (to June 10). Rugby: England play South Africa in the first test in Pretoria on Saturday. The Royal Academy of Art's summer exhibition opens (to Aug 14). Bill Clinton visits the UK. On Saturday, he visits a US military cemetery in Cambridge, then lunches at Chequers with John Major, before a state banquet hosted by the Queen. On Sunday, the US president reviews the D-Day flotilla from the Royal Yacht. Compiled by Patrick Stiles and Ian Holdsworth. Fax: (+44) (0)71 873 3194.</p>

			<p><P> November 17, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HURD MAY BID FOR TORY LEADERSHIP POST IF THATCHER FALTERS  </P> <P> British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd on Friday reserved the right to enter  the Tory party leadership battle if Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher falters in  the first ballot Tuesday.  </P> <P> The only challenge Thatcher faces in that vote is from former Defense Secretary  Michael Heseltine, who is presenting himself as best able to ensure a  Conservative victory in the next election.  </P> <P> If Thatcher fails to get 214 votes from the 372 Tory members of Parliament who  will pick the party's leader -- and thereby the country's prime minister --  there will be a second, and possibly third round.  </P> <P> Hurd, seen as the likeliest compromise candidate in a stalemate, was asked  Friday whether he would rule himself out of the race. He replied simply:  "Against her."  </P> <P> This left the possibility that if Thatcher is so humiliated in the first round  Tuesday that she withdraws, he might enter the race.  </P> <P> Thatcher's aides are confident that she will win in the first round but say  that she would continue to fight. Hurd, who nominated Thatcher for reelection,  stressed that he expects the prime minister to win on the first ballot.  </P> <P> Thatcher will be in Paris for the Conference on Security and Cooperation in  Europe when the votes on her future are counted.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Khartoum, 11 Jan (AFP) -- Eleven high-ranking  members of the rebel the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA)  switched sides to join government forces in the north of the  country, a government newspaper reported Monday. The daily  AL-INQADH AL-WATANI said the 11 had announced their defection  during a meeting with Parliamentary Speaker Muhammad al-Amin  Khalifah in Malakal.    The news came after allegations earlier Monday by rival  rebel  leader Riak Mashar that the SPLA under John Garang was preparing  to attack his forces despite a ceasefire agreement between the  two factions. Riak, leader of SPLA United, which broke away  from the SPLA, said the Islamic fundamentalist government was  also massing troops for a new offensive against the mainly  Christian and animist southern rebels. Fighting reportedly  erupted between rebels and government forces near the Ugandan  border last week, but details were unclear.    According to the paper the head of the defecting rebels,  Colonel Thomas Dut, said that he and his colleagues had decided  to quit Garang's SPLA in order "to take part in rebuilding the  country."    Riak told AFP earlier Monday that Garang was preparing an  attack despite a new agreement between the rival rebel factions  to conduct joint negotiations with Khartoum. But a spokesman  for Garang's group denied the allegation. "It is not true,"  said Philip Lomodong, the faction's east African representative.    Meanwhile the Sudanese Government Monday launched an aid  operation to deliver 62,000 tonnes of food to people in the  stricken south of the country. Aid Commissioner Awad Khalifah  said the deliveries would be made by rail from Babanoussa to  Wau, or by river from Kosti to Juba. Ismail Moustafa, head of  the department for displaced people, said 3,624 families  currently living in camps around Khartoum would be able to go  home. He added that 15,000 people had become refugees since the  start of the civil war in 1983, and were now living in four  camps around Khartoum, where the Sudanese parliament is based.

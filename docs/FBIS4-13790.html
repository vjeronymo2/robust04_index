			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by 'Amira Hess and Yosi Torpstein] </F>   [Excerpt] The Fatah Hawks and Hamas' [Islamic Resistance  Movement] 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam group have announced their joint  decision to stop killing collaborators for a period of one  month, "on condition that during that period all efforts will be  directed toward dealing with this phenomenon." They also urge  the collaborators to "cut off their relations with the enemy's  Shin Bet apparatus." The two groups also forbid all their armed  and wanted men to intervene in conflicts between families and  organizations, rather to let special reconciliation committees  -- or when necessary, the political level -- deal with such  conflicts.    In a jointly signed leaflet disseminated in Gaza two days  ago  it is stated that the representatives of both sides have held a  "historic session" and reached an agreement "aimed at  strengthening national unity." The leaflet reiterates that this  is necessary in order to foil Israeli attempts to polarize the  Palestinian nation. The leaflet details six decisions regarding  relations between the two groups and their violent treatment of  various problems and social phenomena: To immediately stop  mutual recriminations campaigns between Fatah and Hamas, while  respecting all parties' freedom of expression; to stop all  bloody feuds (which have recently proliferated between members  of both organizations); "armed and wanted men from both sides  are banned from intervening in conflicts between families and  organizations."    The leaflet urges minimizing the number of strikes, limiting  their scope (for example, to the neighborhood of a victim only),  and in emergencies to jointly declaring a strike. School  children are urged not to take advantage of strike days, but  rather to stick to their studies and oppose those who force them  to strike. The two groups undertake to stop killing  collaborators for a period of one month during which they will  discuss this phenomenon and give the collaborators an  opportunity to mend their ways.    These decisions clearly reflect the growing criticism and  dissatisfaction in the Gaza Strip concerning the behavior of the  two groups and the terror they strike in people due to their  trigger-happy mentality. Declaring a strike as a form of  mourning has become a power demonstration method vis-a-vis other  organizations, but this disrupts economic life -- which is  difficult enough as it is. Despite the explicit instruction to  continue studies on strike days, many students take advantage of  this situation to skip school, and there are many complaints  about the deteriorating level of studies.    The intervention of armed fugitives from both organizations  in various conflicts has already threatened to develop into  bloody conflicts between the two organizations. In the Gaza  Strip there is a phenomenon of "piratical confiscation" of  vacant lots for enlarging houses or building stalls. In Rafah,  for example, Fatah Hawks more than one month ago demolished a  building built by Hamas for public ends (a medical center and  kindergarten). When Hamas people tried to rebuild it, Fatah  Hawks opened fire, killed one person and wounded approximately  25.    Regarding collaborators, people in Gaza tend to believe that  people who are murdered by 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam are indeed  proven collaborators, and that they are not assassinated rashly.  At the same time, despite the fact that everybody hates the  collaborators, people are concerned about the ramifications of  the almost daily killings, about possible "mistakes" and about  the danger of vendettas. From various comments made by Fatah  and Hamas people alike, it is clear that they too are concerned  about the liberty taken by armed fugitives in these issues,  mainly Fatah Hawks members.

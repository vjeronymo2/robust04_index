			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / Channel tunnel manager jailed for bribery over pipe contracts A PROJECT MANAGER working on the Channel tunnel has been jailed for two years after admitting accepting bribes for passing on confidential details about pipework contracts. Mr Thomas East, a project materials manager for Humphreys &amp; Glasgow, a Croydon-based engineering company, had access to details of multi-million pound contracts and was prepared to leak them to corrupt information brokers, self-employed traders in details about pending contracts. In return, he shared commission won by the brokers if their clients then won the contracts. During 1989, Mr East was paid a total of Pounds 250,000, Southwark Crown Court heard. The case ended on June 11 but reporting restrictions were imposed until yesterday when a separate trial ended. Both trials followed investigations by the Serious Fraud Office into a series of cases of alleged corruption involving the operation of such information brokers. These inquiries have largely concentrated on the role of brokers in the North Sea oil industry. Humphreys &amp; Glasgow were contracted to be responsible for the design and procurement of all pipework in the project. Mr East, who admitted three charges of conspiracy to defraud, fed confidential details to Mr Raymond Doust, who has since fled the country, and information about a Pounds 17m contract to broker Mr Terence Richmond, said Mr Stephen Batten, QC, for the SFO. The contract was won by a German company, and two others were awarded to Mr Doust's clients, Trouvay and Cauvin of Le Havre and Raccortubi of Italy. Mr Richmond, whose trial which took place in November was also not reportable until yesterday, received a two-year suspended jail sentence and was fined Pounds 40,000 after he admitted one charge of bribery. In the other trial which ended yesterday, Mr Shigiki Furutate, an executive with C. Itoh, the Japanese conglomerate, was acquitted of conspiring to defraud British Petroleum by paying information brokers for confidential details of tenders for BP contracts. The two information brokers who sold the secrets after bribing BP staff, Mr Josef Szrajber and Mr Paolo Sorelli, were each jailed for three years in April.</p>

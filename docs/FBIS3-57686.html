			<p>Language: <F P=105> Lithuanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by the Seimas of the Republic of Lithuania </F> in Vilnius on 20 January: "On Russia's Policy Toward the Baltic  States"]    [Text] Assessing the developments in Russia and its  foreign policy, the Seimas [parliament] of the Republic of  Lithuania notes with concern that recent statements by some  Russian officials concerning the Baltic states have taken on a  harsher tone. The words of Russian Foreign Minister A. Kozyrev  about Russia's defense interests in Lithuania, Latvia, and  Estonia, which are constantly called "the near abroad  countries," and about a possible suspension of the Russian Army  withdrawal from Latvia and Estonia confirm this. No ambiguous  maneuvers can reduce the negative meaning of these words.    The presence of the Russian Army in the Baltic states and  the  delay in its withdrawal not only increase instability in Latvia  and Estonia and create possibilities for conflicts and  provocations there, but also endangers Lithuania's security.  All of this shows that Russia ignores signed international  agreements and documents and, through this, poses a threat to  world peace and stability.    The Seimas of the Republic of Lithuania expresses great  concern over Russia's current policy toward the Baltic states  and hopes, at the same time, that processes of democratization  will continue there, and that Russia will respect the  independence and territorial integrity of the Baltic states.    [Signed] Ceslovas Jursenas, chairman of Seimas of the  Republic of Lithuania    [Dated] 20 January 1994</p>

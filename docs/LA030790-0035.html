			<p><P> March 7, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SCREEN STYLE: WHAT'S HOT AROUND THE WORLD  </P> <P> THE SHOW: "House of Style," MTV'S quick read on fashion, airing quarterly.  </P> <P> THE SETUP: Super-model Cindy Crawford hosts this jaunt through France, Milan,  London and the United States in search of what's hot on and off the runways.  </P> <P> THE LOOK: Crawford wears a red, body-hugging, off-the-shoulder Giorgio di  Sant'Angelo top with jeans. As for the rest, hundreds of quick takes convey the  message: "We're hip, we're happening and we're outta here." The swimwear  segment is memorable, with a politically correct "keep our waters clean"  maillot by Robin Piccone for Body Glove. The London streets segment promises  some of the wildest clothes in the world, but comes up looking old hat, with  skull-print casual clothes as well as bell-bottom hippie looks.  </P> <P> THE SOURCES: Show producer Alisa Bellettini says the best source for hot looks  isn't any store: "Young rap kids on the street today dress better than anyone  else around, and they do it with so little money."  </P> <P> QUOTABLE: Giorgio Armani explains why he showed blue jeans on topless models:  "I wanted the jeans to be the focus." Yes, he is serious.  </P> <P> MORE QUOTABLE: Diana Vreeland, the late, preeminent fashion arbiter and editor  of Vogue: "You don't have to be born beautiful to be wildly attractive." The  show concludes with this comforting thought. FRANCINE PARNES  </P></p>

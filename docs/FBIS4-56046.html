			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] A leading Belgrade economic weekly has  predicted that it will be difficult for the Federal Republic of  Yugoslavia (FRY) to sustain the record level of energy  production reached in the past two years. An article in the 11  April issue of EKONOMSKA POLITIKA said that the "achievements"  of the past two years will be difficult to repeat even though  the FRY has assigned the highest priority to energy production.  <H5>  Assessments of 1993 </H5>   Maintaining such a high level would be a very tall order for  the economically impoverished energy producers, which incurred  huge losses in 1993 as a result of inflation and the  government's price policy, EKONOMSKA POLITIKA analysts reported  in the journal's 25 April issue. Oil companies lost tens of  billions of dinars, with the exception of Beopetrol, formerly a  branch of the Croatian oil company INA, which, besides earning  243 billion dinars from the sale of oil derivatives, made a  profit of 2.6 trillion dinars from financial transactions in  1993.    Analyzing the performance of the Serbian electric power  industry, EKONOMSKA POLITIKA assessed 1993 as "the most  difficult period" for the Republic's power companies "since  electricity first arrived in Serbia," with losses amounting to  884 million German marks (DM). When domestic and foreign debt,  depreciation, "and so on" are added, the losses approach DM2  billion. EKONOMSKA POLITIKA blamed the government policy of low  energy prices for this "dismal" result, explaining that "sales  contributed only 1.56 percent of total revenue, with everything  else coming from the consumption of raw materials and capital."  Therefore, the weekly maintained, companies lacked funds for  spare parts and maintenance, resulting in frequent malfunctions,  outages, reduced productivity, and safety violations.  Electricity production, for example, declined from a record  high 37 billion kwh in 1989 to 30 billion kwh last year. It  should be noted, said the weekly, that during this period the  structure of consumption changed, with industrial usage  declining 48 percent while household use rose by almost 50  percent.  <H5>  Seasonal Demand </H5>   Another problem mentioned by EKONOMSKA POLITIKA was the  seasonal fluctuation in energy demand, which ranges from an  average daily consumption of 60 million kwh during the warmer  months to a surge of 130 million kwh in the peak winter season  when electricity, as the cheapest source of energy, is used for  heating. At present price levels, the electric industry will  experience additional losses and be unable to "repeat the  success of the last year" in satisfying high consumer demand.  While the government works on a new, more rational pricing  structure and the reorganization of the energy sector, EKONOMSKA  POLITIKA warns, a "crisis" looms.  <H5>  Diesel Fuel Shortage </H5>   A shortage of D-2 diesel fuel has already affected spring  sowing, reported the same issue of EKONOMSKA POLITIKA, citing  figures from a study conducted by the Yugoslav Chamber of  Commerce. According to the study, the agricultural sector needs  105,000 tons of fuel for the March to June period -- 25,400 tons  of that total in March and 40,000 tons in April. In March,  however, domestic oil producers delivered only 5,400 tons.  Between 1 January and 21 March, the government imported 13,000  tons of the fuel. Taking into account existing fuel reserves  estimated to amount to 15,000 tons, EKONOMSKA POLITIKA concluded  that the agriculture sector is short 71,600 tons of D-2 diesel  fuel for the first half of 1994, with only 32 percent of its  requirements covered. Therefore, the sector will have to receive  increased allocations from domestic suppliers and from imports.  <H5>  Fuel Supplies </H5>   The same issue of EKONOMSKA POLITIKA dismissed reports that  Serbian firms were testing so-called "eko-mer," a new,  environmentally friendly fuel "made from domestic agricultural  raw materials employing domestic technology," as "nice  news...which unfortunately will not solve our problem." It also  reported that the Pancevo oil refinery and the Belgrade firm  Jugopetrol had decided to stop producing and selling 98-octane  premium gasoline because they cannot import the additives needed  to produce it. Beginning 11 April, the refinery was to produce  only 95-octane gasoline containing 0.4 percent lead.  <H5>  Serbia-Montenegro Discord </H5>   The shortage of oil has had an impact on relations between  Serbia and Montenegro, according to the 29 April issue of the  Belgrade daily POLITIKA. Montenegro is demanding that oil  produced in Serbia be sold not only in Serbia but also in  Montenegro, which is otherwise entirely dependent on imports.  POLITIKA reported that Montenegro needs 300 tons of gasoline  and 1,800 tons of diesel fuel per month to satisfy the demands  of its priority consumers: hospitals, schools, health centers,  the police, and farmers. The Federal Crisis Center has proposed  that Montenegro receive 6 to 7 percent of the total oil supply  -- too much, judging by Serbian reactions, and too little,  according to Montenegrin demands, the paper reported.    POLITIKA believes, however, that Serbian and Montenegrin  leaders will conclude an agreement and that Montenegro will be  receiving Serbian oil derivatives by June. In return, the paper  noted, Montenegro will be expected to invest some of its tourism  income in oil production in Serbia's Vojvodina Province, because  Montenegro cannot "seriously make claims on the federation and  at the same time ignore its obligations to the federation."  POLITIKA contrasted the discord over the oil supply to the  "exemplary" cooperation between the Serbian and Montenegrin  electric power companies, which function as an integrated  electric-energy system.</p>

			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / World Trade News: Sutherland warning for G7 MR Peter Sutherland, the new director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, warned yesterday that failure by the Group of Seven leaders to inject new momentum into the stalled world trade talks at their summit in Tokyo later this week would put not only the Uruguay Round but the multilateral trading system and the world economy at risk. 'Concrete progress' on a package to open markets to foreign goods and services was needed to relaunch the 116-nation negotiations in Geneva, he said. With just five months before the December 15 deadline for concluding the round, a failure to move forward would deal the round 'a very serious blow' and endanger the multilateral trading structure built up since the war. In his first news conference since taking over at the helm of Gatt on July 1, Mr Sutherland said the best hope for the 26m jobless in the G7 countries lay in bolstering business confidence with a rapid and successful conclusion to the round. Calling on the summit to resist protectionist pressures, he said some 23m jobs in the seven countries depended on exports of goods and would be at risk from protection of ailing industrial sectors. 'It cannot surely be the case that special interest groups within the major trading areas can hold the whole process to ransom,' he said. 'If the G7 leaders are serious about attacking the root of chronic long-term unemployment, about re-igniting growth and prosperity, about creating a new dynamism, the way to do it is by actively assisting in the conclusion of the Uruguay Round.' This could boost world income by Dollars 200bn a year. Mr Sutherland added that despite recent setbacks he expected a successful conclusion to the round. 'I cannot believe we are capable of taking such a collectively ridiculous decision as to endanger the multilateral system.' Making clear he intended to take an active role in shepherding the seven-year-old round to completion in December, Mr Sutherland said he would 'devote every bit of energy' he had to finding solutions to problems blocking progress. However, his 'fundamental role' was as an honest broker between the parties.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report from New York] </F>   [Text] The following information is provided by Mr. Liu  Jianjun [0491 1696 6511], who used to be a journalist in  mainland China and has now emigrated to the United States.  Zhang Yufeng, rumored in China and abroad to be Mao Zedong's  "secret wife," was once Mao's confidential secretary and looked  after Mao in his daily life over a long period of time. She  recently broke her silence, which lasted over a decade, and  accepted an interview with the mainland's top movie star, Liu  Xiaoqing [0491 2556 1987], special hostess of the television  history program entitled "Mao Zedong's Path." At the interview,  she revealed how she met Mao Zedong and what she saw and heard  during that time.    "When I first began to work, I was with the Mudanjiang  Railway Bureau as a dining car attendant and train announcer.  Later, I was selected and transferred to the special purpose  section of the Ministry of Railways. In 1960, at the age of 17,  I was transferred to Chairman Mao's exclusive train. My first  errand was to serve on the train that took Chairman Mao to  Guangzhou, where he was to attend a discussion on the  formulation of the 60-item agricultural policy. The train was  in Guangzhou for quite some months. At the beginning, I did not  know who the master of the train was and because we followed  very strict discipline, I dared not try to find out. The  exclusive train had 12 cars. Train attendants were not allowed  to enter cars that were for leaders' use only without  permission. On our way back to Beijing, Chairman Mao and the  crew had a photo taken at the platform of Anhui's Bengbu  Station, and it was then that I saw him for the first time. In  1962, I was transferred to Chairman Mao's compartment to work,  and in 1970, I was transferred to Zhongnanhai to work by the  chairman's side. I started as an ordinary member of the staff.  In 1974, I was appointed "confidential secretary."    "I had only seen Chairman Mao on pictures or in movies. When  he appeared before my eyes in real life, I was very excited, so  much so that I even forgot to greet him. But later, when I was  with him from morning to night every day, I was no longer as  excited as when I first met him."    "In my eyes, in terms of status, he was our great leader; in  terms of knowledge, he was my teacher; in terms of age and the  emotional aspect, he was like my father. When I went to his  residence in Zhongnanhai to work, he was already a 77-year-old  man. By that time, he was suffering from a number of health  problems. Sometimes he was in a bad mood. He showed all his  emotions: Joy, anger, sorrow, and grievances."    Liu Xiaoqing asked: Did Chairman Mao ever lose his temper  with you?    Zhang replied: Everybody has a temper, and so did Chairman  Mao. When we did something wrong, or when he was in a bad mood,  he would have a fit of temper. For instance, one time he was  reading some documents and kept putting off his mealtime. I saw  the dishes were getting cold, so I reminded him to have his meal  first. Chairman got angry over this and said: Don't you see I  am reading documents? At that moment, I felt wronged and  thought: I do not deserve criticism for doing my best to serve  you. Now I can see that I should not have blamed him. He was  very old then, and yet he had to take care of major matters of  the country. The international climate was fast-changing and  stability at home was also in question. He was under a lot of  stress, so his mood swings were normal. After the fit, he would  be over it and never brood on it.    Liu Xiaoqing asked: Did you feel very blessed to work by  Chairman Mao's side?    Zhang said: I only felt it was a big responsibility. Even  to this day, I still feel the heavy burden on my shoulders.    Liu Xiaoqing asked: Did Lin Biao's case have any effect on  Chairman Mao's health?    Zhang replied: Yes, it did. Not just the 13 September  incident when Lin Biao fled the country. It can be traced to  the Second Plenary Session of the Ninth CPC Central Committee in  1970 when his conflict with Lin Biao had intensified, which gave  him a negative mental impact. After Lin's defection, he got  very ill. From then on, his health went downhill.    Liu Xiaoqing asked: Did Chairman Mao take tonics?    Zhang replied: Chairman never believed that medicines could  cure everything. He often went for a walk and consciously ate  mixed grains, such as corn and sweet potatoes. Sometimes he  would also eat some wild herbs, such as purslane. He did not go  for wheat products and found it very hard to understand why  people in my native home eat dumplings in the New Year season.  He said: What is so nice about dumplings? He would rather eat  brown rice [considered inferior rice] than dumplings or steamed  buns. But he also routinely took some tonics, such as American  ginseng and vitamins.    Liu Xiaoqing asked: What was Chairman Mao's attitude  toward death?    Zhang replied: One day, I heard the chairman talking about a  proverb which goes: At the age of 73 to 84, one would leave  this world even without the King of Hell's invitation. So I  comforted him and said: You have a good constitution. Any  problem will go after a good treatment. But to my surprise, he  did not like what I said. He said: You are going against  nature's law. Where there is life, there is death. Everybody  has to die. To say that someone would not die is just nonsense.  He was a materialist. He kept a composed and serene look even  to the last moment of his life.    Liu Xiaoqing asked: Did Chairman Mao leave a will?    Zhang said: As everybody knows, as early as in 1957,  Chairman Mao advocated that central leaders be cremated after  death and set an example by being the first to sign on the  resolution about cremation.    Liu Xiaoqing: Chairman Mao was still learning foreign  languages in his old age. How well did he speak them?    Zhang replied: The chairman liked to learn foreign  languages. He did not stop even after he was ill in his final  years. He used English in conversations with foreign visitors.  Interpreters said he spoke quite well.    Liu Xiaoqing: Did Chairman Mao know about the big earthquake  at Tangshan?    Zhang replied: Yes, he did. Before the earthquake, in June,  he had an attack of myocardial infarction and was rescued. By  July, his condition was a bit unstable [as published], but he  could not move or get out of bed. When the earthquake struck on  28 July, we were woken by the tremor and immediately rushed to  Chairman Mao's study [shu wu 2579 1450]. He was still lying in  bed. The medical personnel opened a big sheet and covered the  bed in case something dropped from above. The chairman was in  his right mind at that time and was aware that an earthquake had  happened. Unable to say anything, he just feebly waved his  hand, probably telling us not to panic.    The special interview, originally timed for eight minutes,  actually lasted one-and-a-half hours. The time for screening  the interview has not been decided.</p>

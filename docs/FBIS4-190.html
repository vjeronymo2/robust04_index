			<p>BFN     [Text] An ANC [African National Congress] spokesman, Mr.  Ronnie Mamoepa, has denied a statement in a report by police  commissioner, General Johan van der Merwe, that ANC President,  Mr. Nelson Mandela, has undertaken to hand over weapons used in  this week's slaughter of Zulus in Johannesburg.    Mr. Mamoepa told Radio Pretoria's news desk that he was not  aware of this agreement and that the ANC would not issue a  statement. Mr. Mamoepa confirmed that no weapons or ammunition  were handed to the police by the ANC. This development follows  a denial by the NP [National Party] leader, Mr. F.W. de Klerk,  that he and Law and Order Minister Hernus Kriel ordered  Witwatersrand regional police commissioner, General Koos Calitz,  not to carry out a search warrant at ANC headquarters, Shell  House. This warrant was issued shortly after snipers shot at  marchers from Shell House during a peaceful Zulu protest march  in which several Zulus were killed. A police liaison officer,  Colonel Dave Bruce, declared that he is not surprised at Mr.  Mamoepa's reaction.    In reply to a question on whether Gen. Calitz did not act  too  lightly by just accepting Mr. Mandela's word, Colonel Bruce  replied, and we quote: You must remember that the undertaking  was given in a discussion between the regional police  commissioner and the future state president of the country. I  do not know what Mr. Mandela's agreement is with his personnel.    Radio Pretoria put to Colonel Bruce that everything points  to  a situation where the ANC will simply deny the existence of  possible murder weapons. The following question was put to Mr.  Bruce: Why do the police not act in terms of the search warrant,  since Mr. Mandela probably tricked the police.    Colonel Bruce replied that the police were meeting to decide  on a course of action.</p>

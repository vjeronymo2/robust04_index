			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The ATM and debit card processing businesses are rife with similar opportunities for dominant networks like MAC to manipulate interconnection requirements and related financial and operating procedures to exclude competitors by imposing on third party processors operating rules or technical and financial requirements with little or no legitimate business purpose_rules and procedures designed to raise the costs to third party processors and thereby frustrate competition. For example, one of the ``hottest'' technical developments in the field relates to the method of encryption (or coding) of transactions to ensure their security as the cardholder's request is transmitted from the terminal to the network to the card issuing institution, and the authorization and transaction instructions are transmitted through the network, back to the terminal. Currently, MAC and others operate on a ``master key'' system, under which all transactions from the terminal are given the same code. Many networks have indicated that they intend to change to a ``DUKPT'' system, where every transaction will be given a unique key. Many processors, however, are not presently equipped to operate on a DUKPT system, and they will require very substantial lead time (and need to invest substantial funds) to modify or replace existing equipment. (For example, in the credit card processing industry, the lead time for implementing changes reflecting technological advances often ranges from 3 to 5 years.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Security of customer transactions is clearly a legitimate concern of the networks. However, before DUKPT or other technical advances are implemented, the Department of Justice should have mechanisms in place to ensure the changes meet legitimate needs and that they are implemented in a pro-competitive manner. Particularly in a business undergoing rapid technological change, a mechanism is needed both to insure that the rules and regulations of the monopoly provider are not designed to inhibit competition by other providers using existing technology and, at the same time, insure that the MAC network be open to competitors using new and technologically superior equipment. <FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>  Accordingly, before the Department of Justice recommends that the current rules governing intercept processors be applied to third party processors, it should review MAC's technical, financial, and operating rules and determine that those standards do not have a negative impact on competition. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Technical requirements are not the only area where card processors have already experienced abuse by dominant providers. For example, ATM and debit networks have been known to impose upon third party processors unwarranted and unjustified delays in transferring money to third party processor funding accounts. They have also required processors to send significant numbers of their employees to network training sessions and charged prohibitive per employee fees, where training of a small number of supervisory employees would suffice. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> To ensure compliance by MAC with its obligation under the judgment to impose on third party, unaffiliated, multiple bank processors only such additional technical criteria as is ``reasonably appropriate,'' and to be sure that all subsequent modifications and additions to regulations and operating procedures made to keep pace with changing technology are necessary and do not discriminate against third party processors, the decree should require MAC to publish and circulate to third party processors for comment such modifications before their enactment. At a minimum, MAC should be required to make those rules and procedures available to third party processors at the same time that they are available to intercept processors. Providing third party processors with the right to review and comment on proposed technical requirements could give third party processors the opportunity to recommend less costly but equally secure measures (if such measures are available and adequate) and, in any event, would ensure that third party processors are informed of technical changes in a timely fashion so that they can comply with such changes. These proposed modifications to the proposed Final Judgment will promote industry self-regulation and assure that third party processors are not frozen-out by unnecessary technical, financial or operational requirements, or changes made to those requirements on short notice. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

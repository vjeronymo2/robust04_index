			<p>BFN     [Text] Paris, April 8 (AFP) -- Negotiators discussing  Iran's 1.2-billion-franc ($204 million) trade debts with France  failed to make headway at talks here this week on a rescheduling  package, participants disclosed on Friday [8 April]. Talks  would resume within a few weeks once the delegations had  reported back to their governments, the sources said without  giving any more precise date. They refused to specify what had  blocked agreement, and said there was "nothing unusual" in such  negotiations taking place in several stages.    Despite U.S. reservations about refinancing Iranian debt,  Iran has in recent weeks won advantageous terms from its top  trading partners Germany and Japan, plus Switzerland, Austria  and Italy. It owes them almost 6.5 billion dollars and in most  cases has been given four or five years to pay.    Unofficial sources here said France was offering only a  year.  Last year's suspension of credits from Coface, the body  supplying insurance and credit for French exporters, would  remain in force while the debt problem with Iran was unresolved,  the sources said.</p>

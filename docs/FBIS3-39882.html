			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Dietrich Zwaetz: "Words and Action"] </F>   [Text] It honors the U.S. Administration that after the  new failure of the trade talks with Japan, it is taking another  30 days to reflect on possible punitive duties on U.S. imports  from Japan. It is also to Washington's credit that despite the  20 years of futile negotiations, it does not want to start a  trade war.    If sanctions were to be imposed against Japan, then these  should only refer to one marginal event: the breaking of the  1989 agreement which reserved 33-50 percent of the cordless  telephone market in Tokyo to the U.S. firm Motorola.  Eventually, the Americans received only 5 percent.    Maybe Tokyo will take this last threat from Washington  seriously. Maybe Japan's border barriers will not go up for cars  and car parts, computers, telephone systems, medical equipment,  and insurance companies from the United States. It is more  likely that Tokyo has once more gained time -- and the United  States is once more using the threat to impose sanctions in  vain. Such actions wear off, even if U.S. trade delegate Mickey  Kantor has announced the reactivation of the ill-famed Article  301 of the 1988 Trade Law, under which the United States claims  the powers of an international trade policeman.  <H5>  Irresolute International Trade Policeman </H5>   The surprising element in the U.S. position is its  irresolution, the apparent gap between words and action. If  Washington really were to regard Japan's $58 billion in trade  surplus with the United States as intolerable, and if Tokyo  fails to fulfill concessions it made and draws out negotiations  over decades, which is what the Americans think, then the threat  to impose sanctions must not remain pure tongue lashing.    Then Kantor must encourage his President in the White House  to finally let action follow the many words, tragic as this  would be for free international trade and the atmosphere in the  GATT. Yet Kantor, who has been described as a "tough fellow,"  has again and again proved to be a hesitater and, in this  manner, he is gaining very little for his country.  <H5>  Put Credibility at Stake </H5>   Meanwhile, in their trade talks with Japan, American  politicians only experience what they themselves are doing to  other countries -- for example the FRG in the air transport  negotiations. Washington's negotiators probably only laugh  about German threats to cancel the meanwhile obsolete air  transport agreement.    Trade policy is always nationalistic, even if exercised on  the seemingly neutral forum of the GATT in Geneva. Nobody  blames trade politicians for representing the interests of their  countries. Yet, they must be careful not to lose credibility.  And it is this credibility that the United States is putting at  stake in its negotiations with Japan.    No one wants a trade war, even if it takes place in foreign  regions; it would be an infringement on the GATT rules. Yet,  if the United States still wants to be taken seriously, it must  take itself at its word. The catalogue of sins that Japan has  been confronted with for many years quite obviously does not  have the expected effect. Trade delegate Mickey Kantor has a  reputation for being tough. Maybe toughness is only a disguise  for a lack of concept, a lacking conclusive policy.</p>

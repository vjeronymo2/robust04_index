			<p><P> September 1, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NOT BEWITCHED  </P> <P> Wilmington's review of "The Witches" leads parents to believe that this movie  is appropriate for children. I think he is mistaken.  </P> <P> I'm well into my 30s and I had trouble dealing with the graphic images and  primal terrors the film presents. I read the book when I was 9 years old. It  sent thrilling shivers up my spine, but a child's own imagination will conjure  up images only as frightening as those to which they've been exposed. Someone  else's larger-than-life conception, solidified on celluloid, influenced by the  benefit of however many hardships Nicolas Roeg has endured (warts, scabs and  all), is more than most kids can swallow.  </P> <P> I saw a large 10-year-old boy climb onto his father's lap in the theater. Six-  and 7-year-olds were dragging their parents into the lobby saying "Get me out  of here!" as Anjelica Huston rotated her pelvis in anticipation of a young  boy's transformation from Homo sapiens to rodent.  </P> <P> This is strong psychological material for a child to assimilate. As a parent,  my rating on a scale of "Thoughtful" to "Junk Food" would be "Nightmares for a  Year."  </P> <P> TERRI MILLER-SHULMAN  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

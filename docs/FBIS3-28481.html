They demanded that the puppet authorities leave the blanks  of  15 basic farm products including rice unfilled when presenting  the final enforcement plan for Uruguay Round market opening,  which is scheduled on February 15.    They declared that they would wage a struggle throughout  South Korea if their demand were not accepted by the authorities.    They warned that the puppet authorities would face a greater  resistance if the latter dealt with by law those arrested in the  demonstration on February 1.</p>

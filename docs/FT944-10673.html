			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / Survey of Bolivia (3): A healthier footing - Trade and foreign policy The accelerating process of opening Bolivia up to international markets, started in 1985, is beginning to bear fruit. A combination of entrepreneurial thrust and bilateral free trade agreements has helped close the yawning 1993 trade gap. Now, in 1994, growing non-traditional exports are helping put Bolivia on a healthier footing with trading partners. 'Bolivia adopted market-oriented reforms and low import tariffs earlier than any Latin American country except Chile,' says Mr Carlos Morales, trade and industry minister. 'It's been tough for businessmen but they now realise that, with a small domestic market and low per capita income, we must export in order to produce.' Official figures show revenue from non-traditionals - principally soya beans, gold jewellery and textiles - jumped 83 per cent in first half of 1994 compared with the same period last year. By year's end, the trade ministry estimates, non-traditionals could earn Dollars 400m, approaching half of all export revenue. Last year, almost 40 per cent of Bolivia's trade was with other Latin American countries. The European Union accounted for 28 per cent - mainly traditional mineral exports - and the US for 24 per cent. High transport costs mean Bolivia's present exports to Asia are a slim 8 per cent - products are mainly natural-resource based with little value added. The US has become the main market for Bolivia's non-traditional exports. Under the Andean Trade Preference Act - instituted during the presidency of Mr George Bush to help support alternatives to illegal drugs trafficking - some 6,000 Bolivian products can enter the US free of duty. Although landlocked, Bolivia has the advantage of sharing borders with many countries. Under the Paz Zamora administration, Bolivia started negotiating a series of bilateral trade accords with neighbours and other Latin American countries. These initiatives have been stepped up under President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada. 'The adoption by the Andean Pact countries of market-oriented economic policies has been good news for Bolivia,' says Mr Morales. Peru is Bolivia's chief customer within the Pact, buying Dollars 42m in Bolivian non-traditional goods (mainly soya and its derivatives) in first-half 1994 - nearly a quarter of the total exported and 63 per cent more than for the first six months of 1993. Boosting the chances of closer integration with Peru is the 1992 agreement which granted Bolivia rights to an industrial free trade zone and a 5km strip of desert coast near the southern Peruvian port of Ilo. In return, Peru won access to Bolivian river port facilities in Puerto Suarez, on the borders of Brazil, with an outlet to the Atlantic. Bolivia, however, is in pursuit of the largest possible number of trading partners. It is particularly attracted to the Mercosur group of countries comprising Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay. Bolivia was granted 'observer status' last December. 'We see ourselves as a hinge between the Andean Pact and Mercosur,' says Mr Morales. 'We believe in a larger trade area and we're negotiating aggressively within the vision of Mercosur.' In January and March this year, Bolivia signed preliminary free trade agreements with Paraguay and Brazil to complement its existing accords with Argentina and Uruguay. These are seen as essential, if limited, first steps in fulfilment of the ambition to join Mercosur. A landmark trade accord with Chile, signed in April 1993, has so far proved disappointing. La Paz businessmen claim that Chile is blocking Bolivian exports by over-rigidly applying non-tariff regulations while swamping the Bolivian market with Chilean consumer goods. Re-negotiations in October, however, should give Bolivians a chance to level the trade score. Bolivia's most recent trade accord was signed with Mexico in September, allowing for phasing in of total free trade within 15 years. However, 98 per cent of all products will be traded tariff-free within 10 years and a significant portion immediately. Trade between the two countries is small - worth less than Dollars 20m in 1993 - and weighted in favour of Mexico. But Bolivians expect exports of wood, alpaca textiles and gold jewellery to expand fast. Government officials estimate that bilateral trade will jump to Dollars 50m in year one. Meanwhile, Bolivia is also starting to see benefits from its five free trade zones established from 1991 onwards. Their objective is to cut incentives for the flourishing contraband business which for years has sliced into state revenue from import duties and value-added tax. Mr Oscar Ewel, general manager of GIT, the company which holds the 40-year concessions for the La Paz and Santa Cruz free trade zones, estimates that some 60 per cent of the Dollars 400m or so imported into Bolivia via Chile's free port of Iquique is smuggled. Mr Ewel believes that illegal goods entering Bolivia from Brazil via Santa Cruz account for Dollars 300m of a total of some Dollars 420m. GIT (part of the Banco Industrial-ICE group) has invested Dollars 8m in La Paz free zone infrastructure to date. Some 350 Bolivian companies are now regular users and GIT expects to handle in excess of Dollars 100m this year. With a standard 10 per cent import duty and 13 per cent sales tax, GIT is collecting some Dollars 25m for the Bolivian customs. In a late October initiative, the La Paz free trade zone inaugurated a direct import service 'to help formalise the informal trader who spends under Dollars 2,000 at any one time,' says Mr Ewel. Those buying through the free trade zone will receive and supply proper invoices, an innovation for the street-sellers of La Paz and their customers. Santa Cruz's free trade zone started operating in January. This year it will handle some Dollars 30m in merchandise, not yet making much of a dent in contraband from Brazil. Smaller free trade zones have also been set up under concession in the cities of Cochabamba, Oruro and Puerto Aguirre. Still pending is reform of Bolivia's customs service which is scheduled for privatisation in the near future.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Alexandr Lebedyev, Russian ambassador to the </F> Czech Republic, by Libor C. Cerny; place and date not given:  "Central and East Europe Is Not To Become a Sphere of Influence  for Russia or Any Other Power"]    [Excerpt] [Passage omitted]    [Cerny] What do you think of the statement by Andrey  Kozyrev,  Russian minister of foreign affairs, who said that the countries  of Central and East Europe may not become members of NATO  without Russia?    [Lebedyev] Statements by Kozyrev, and not just by him, are  being interpreted very loosely by the Czech press. This is not  criticism--just a simple statement of fact. Two or three  sentences taken out of context are used to create a simplified  picture. In all of his statements, Kozyrev had emphasized that  the Czech Republic and all the countries of East Europe have a  right to enter any international structures they consider  suitable for themselves. Moscow merely desires that, while  making these decisions, those countries should bear in mind  Moscow's viewpoint and its security interests.    [Cerny] Why does Moscow have this interest?    [Lebedyev] The Warsaw Pact has been dismantled, while NATO  continues to exist and is preparing itself for a transformation.  I have heard from my colleagues, ambassadors of other countries,  that intensive work is in progress on this transformation. Yet,  while one system has been dismantled and the other still exists,  the concepts upon which NATO was founded were not abolished.    [Cerny] NATO is not an enemy.    [Lebedyev] The principal concept that postulated that the  Soviet Union, whose successor state Russia is, was the principal  enemy has not been called off by anyone, except in the political  sense. True, on the political level, NATO has already stated  that Russia is not the enemy. For our part, we have done the  same; Russian leaders have stated that we do not view NATO as an  enemy. However, all of this must be anchored in some kind of a  system of new relations between NATO, Russia, and the countries  of Central and East Europe. If that does not happen, the  membership of the countries of Central and East Europe in NATO  will cause Russia to feel threatened. Today it can be the Czech  Republic and Slovakia, tomorrow perhaps Ukraine and the Baltic  states. This perception of danger and instability, stemming  primarily from our historical experiences, unfortunately has an  impact on our internal situation. That is a very delicate aspect  that must be kept in mind, and that is exactly what Kozyrev was  talking about.    [Cerny] When will Russia make an effort to become a member  of  NATO?    [Lebedyev] As regards Russia's NATO membership, it is not  being contemplated at the moment, but it is very important to  establish guidelines suitably reflecting the partnership  relations between NATO and Russia. Some kind of structuring is  needed for this.    [Cerny] Partnership for Peace?    [Lebedyev] Russia is a member of the Council for North  Atlantic Cooperation (NACC), as is the Czech Republic and other  countries. Perhaps it would be possible through this  organization to widen the concept of "Partnership for Peace,"  which will be concretized at the NATO summit in Brussels. Tn any  case, Partnership for Peace provides an opportunity to give the  relations between the individual countries a concrete shape.  That would neutralize the growth of an incipient danger--namely,  a security structure that includes the greater part of Europe  and casts Russia off somewhere to the outskirts. Such an  arrangement would even mean danger for the countries of Central  and East Europe. During the past 200 years, Russia took part in  almost all of the wars on the European Continent and also in all  of the security structures that were formed at the end of those  wars--for example, the Vienna Congress of 1815 comes to mind. It  is necessary to emulate these structures also in the present, to  make room for Russia in them, so that a feeling of isolation is  not created inside Russia, so that Russia can take its place as  a dependable participant and guarantor of the new security  systems that are being formulated.    [Cerny] What are the main spheres of Russian interest inside  the Czech Republic?    [Lebedyev] First, I would like to differentiate between the  expression "sphere of influence" and "sphere of interest." I  resolutely reject the assertion that Central and East Europe is  to be the sphere of influence of Russia or any other world  power. By the expression "sphere of influence," I understand a  seizure of certain strong positions by one country inside  another country. These positions then make it possible for the  first country to directly influence matters of internal policy,  foreign policy and other areas, inside the target country. For  example, the fact that the Czech press devotes a lot of  attention to events inside Russia shows that Russia is within  the Czech Republic's sphere of interest. This is logical because  events inside Russia may have a substantive impact on the  development of the situation in your country. By the same token,  the countries of Central and East Europe are within Russia's  natural sphere of interest because Moscow is interested in  maintaining a commercial partnership with these countries and,  also important, in keeping the region stable. A threat to Russia  could develop there. In such a context, we cannot view, for  example, Honduras to be within a similar Russia's sphere of  interest, while Germany and Austria, as well as the Czech  Republic, are; this is caused by their geographical position in  the center of Europe.    [Cerny] To keep stability in the region?    [Lebedyev] Central Europe also belongs to the sphere of  interest of the United States, as stated by Washington.  Stability of the region has great political and military  importance also for the United States, and, in this sense,  strategic interests of world powers are similar in respect to  Central Europe and the entire European Continent. This fact must  be the cornerstone of the partnership.    The principal Russian interest in the Czech Republic, in my  view, is the establishment and development of economic  cooperation. This will help, among other things, to solve the  question of Russian indebtedness to the Czech Republic, which is  very important. In the political field, it is very important for  us to maintain normal relations of European standard with the  Czech Republic. We also regard it as desirable to have  cooperation between political parties of the democratic type. I  see this as an important factor in maintaining an atmosphere of  confidence. Such understanding of the situation and approach to  it will, over time, weaken that certain "allergy" of some of our  politicians toward NATO.    [Cerny] Do you mean to say that, in the vocabulary of  Russian  Government leaders and diplomats, there is no room for the  expression "sphere of influence"?    [Lebedyev] I think that our politicians must first precisely  formulate the concept. What I have stated here is merely my  personal opinion. But I do know that the official Russian  foreign-policy line does not contain this concept. Perhaps there  are politicians, such as Zhirinovskiy, who do want to attempt to  define the Russian "sphere of influence." But I would be the  first to oppose such efforts." [passage omitted]</p>

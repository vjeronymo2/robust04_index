			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report ALUMINIUM closed near five-week highs on the LME in active trading, three-month metal touching Dollars 1,169 a tonne at one stage. The market was underpinned by speculative buying, investment fund purchases and short-covering. Caution ahead of US labour contract expiries at the end of this month also encouraged the market to break resistance around Dollars 1,150. COPPER moved away from its lows helped by news that El Teniente in Chile might be closed for five days because of recent rains. Copper's movements were largely dictated by technical factors, with May option expiries passing without surprises. GOLD fixed at Dollars 354.25 a troy ounce in the afternoon against Dollars 352.75 in the morning after physical demand pushed Comex higher shortly after its opening. But they were slightly concerned about the choppy nature of the market despite its moving to a couple of dollars above its key Dollars 352 support level, which was tested twice. Below this the next buffer was at Dollars 348; on the upside, Dollars 357-Dollars 358 was seen attainable this week with Dollars 360 a more formidable task, dealers said. Compiled from Reuters</p>

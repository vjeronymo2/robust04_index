This  statement was made by Ukrainian Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko  in Kiev Friday at the meeting with diplomats and journalists.    He has said that the absence of the decision on joining the  treaty should not be interpreted as a negative attitude to the  document. The issue is still on the agenda, believes the  Ukrainian Foreign Minister.    The parliament resolution, said the Minister, opens the way  to the implementation of tripartite documents on nuclear  disarmament, involving Ukraine, the United States and Russia.  Zlenko believes that it is planned to hold shortly bilateral  and tripartite talks of experts on the implementation of the  Moscow documents. He said that the date for the talks is about  to be set.    Zlenko believes the parliament resolution will provide the  possibility to boost the negotiations with international  financial organizations to offer Ukraine effective economic aid.  The Minister also pointed to the need to speed up the financial  and economic aid to Ukraine.    "I am absolutely sure," he said, "that the treaty should not  be an obstacle to providing aid to Ukraine," said Zlenko.    The wording of the resolution's second provision  unambiguously points to the fact that the exchange of the  instruments of ratification on the START-1 treaty will be the  first step. At the same time, he said, the parties involved  will negotiate concrete intergovernment agreements which proceed  from the reservations contained in the parliament resolution of  November 18, 1993.    Asked by Interfax-Ukraine about possible debates in  parliament over the timetable for Ukraine joining the treaty,  Zlenko did not rule out that the present parliament would also  consider the issue.</p>

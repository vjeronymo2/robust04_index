			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / Arts: Small-scale Swiss attractions The English Chamber Orchestra's attractive Swiss programme on Monday failed by a long way to attract the audience it deserved. One hoped that the Swiss music-lovers on hand took no offence. The trouble was, simply, that no big works coming out of Switzerland (except a very few whole-evening ones - operas, oratorios - which demand larger forces) have come into the international repertoire. Many people have heard and enjoyed a little Honegger, and maybe Frank Martin's Petite Symphonie Concertante, and just possibly something by Othmar Schoeck; but a concert devoted to those three composers will not pull a crowd. And certainly not at Barbican prices, when its natural home would be the smaller, thriftier Queen Elizabeth Hall. In fact Martin's PSC was the opening piece here, and very well played too. It exercised its familiar, slightly clammy grip, with a hint of inexorable mechanism. Howard Griffiths has already spent a dozen years conducting in Switzerland and his soloists on piano, harp and harpsichord were the faithful Yonty Solomon, Thelma Owen and Ian Watson, balanced with excellent clarity. Martin's sound-world has a quite particular glint, and his pattern-building a severe hieratic air. It really is time that we had a full-scale production of his fine, dark Shakespeare opera on The Tempest. Honegger's highly conscious constructions reveal a formal sensibility much like his, though Honegger liked pithier, more resiny sounds. Thus his war-time Second Symphony for strings, which ended the concert: a neat, modestly original ground-plan, with a doomy central passacaglia and a trumpet ('optional') to brighten its final chorale. As often in Honegger, that seems a kind of backtracking to public piety - Protestant at heart, surely, despite his still-popular Jeanne d'Arc au bucher - by way of solemnly joining hands. The trumpet was admirable; the racing strings might have enjoyed one more rehearsal. For many listeners, Schoeck's early Violin Concerto will have been the discovery of the evening. Plainly it occupies youthful, dewy Richard Strauss territory, with little harmonic tweaks where later Schoeck grew into ripe expressive complications; but the solo part is eager and songful. Lydia Mordkovich delivered it with vital enthusiasm. There was also a surprise bonbon in the 58-year-old Rolf Urs Ringger's 'con slancio', a five-minute piece of honest, almost up-to-date engineering with vibes and much knitting of short phrases. It generated some brief, effective splashes, but no continuing ripples. Sponsored by Reuters</p>

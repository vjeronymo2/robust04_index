			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Tehran IRIB Television Second Program  Network in Persian begins broadcasting Friday prayers in Qom at  1529 GMT on 31 December, led by Ayatollah Amini, lecturer at the  theological school and a senior member of the Assembly of  Experts.    In his first sermon, Amini speaks on the various aspects of  Shi'ite leadership and the source of emulation, including the  meaning of religious judgment, the need for religious leaders,  and conditions for the post.    He says that there are hundreds of capable individuals at  theological schools who could be sources of emulation, but have  failed to do so because they are more interested in teaching.  He calls on them to formulate religious laws in all fields,  particularly social affairs.    Amini says he supports the recent statement by Qom's  theological scholars approving Ayatollah Araki's position as the  source of emulation after the death of Ayatollah Golpayegani.    In his second sermon, which begins at at 1556 GMT, he speaks  on the spiritual and social life of first Shi'ite Imam Ali.    The second sermon ends at 1610 GMT.</p>

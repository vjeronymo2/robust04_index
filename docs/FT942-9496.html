			<p>940516 FT  16 MAY 94 / India curbs lending to help control inflation: The authorities are sensitive to the dangers of rapid price rises The Reserve Bank of India, the central bank, at the weekend imposed curbs on bank lending in order to help contain rising inflation but has left interest rates unchanged to prevent stifling industry. The central bank aims to cut the inflation rate, as measured by the wholesale price index, by four percentage points from its current level of over 11 per cent a year, said Mr C Rangarajan, the governor, after a board meeting on Saturday. The board met to determine credit policy for the period to the end of September amid mounting concern about inflation which has risen from a low of under 7 per cent last summer to over 11 per cent recently. But with interest rates high by international standards and industry only just beginning to recover from prolonged stagnation, the central bank's directors felt they could not tighten monetary policy much. They judged that after cutting rates four times in the year to February 1994, bringing the lending rate down to 14 per cent, it was too early to start raising rates. Instead of increasing interest rates the central bank has lifted by one percentage point the cash reserve ratio - the proportion of deposits which commercial banks must deposit at the central bank. Controls on export finance are also being tightened. With the help of these measures, the central bank hopes to reduce the rate of increase in the money supply from an estimated 17.9 per cent for the year ending in March 1994 to 14-15 per cent for 1994-95. Mr Rangarajan said after the meeting that he would not hesitate to act more aggressively if inflation continued to rise further then expected. He thought the rate of increase would level off after another two months. Inflation has been pushed up in recent months by a combination of price increases in important commodity markets, including sugar, edible oils and cotton, and of financial pressures. The flood of foreign exchange coming into India, fuelled by increases in foreign portfolio investment, has raised foreign exchange reserves to a record level of Dollars 17bn, (Pounds 11.6bn) compared with about Dollars 1bn in mid-1991 when a balance-of-payments crisis forced India to take emergency loans from the International Monetary Fund and start wide-ranging economic reforms. The inflationary impact of this inflow has been compounded by high levels of government borrowing. The fiscal deficit for the year ended in March rose to 7.3 per cent, against a target of 4.6 per cent and the target for this year has been set at a generous 6 per cent. Even though Mr Rangarajan said that the government has kept its borrowings well under control in the first few weeks of the new financial year, some economists doubt whether the discipline will be maintained. With important state elections due later this year and early next year, the ruling Congress (I) party will be tempted to overspend rather than underspend the budget, particularly on subsidies to farmers. India has generally been more successful than many developing countries in controlling inflation. Prices rose by an annual average of just over 8 per cent in the 1980s. The inflation rate soared during the 1991 economic crisis to a 13.7 per cent, but, with the help of curbs in public spending, fell sharply to 8.2 per cent for 1993-94. However, with so many poor people, the country cannot accept sustained high levels of price increases without bringing hardship and the risk of civil unrest. The authorities therefore tend to be very sensitive to the dangers of inflation. Whether they succeed in curbing price increases this time will depend largely on how the government manages its budget in the face of political pressures. The IMF, in its recent report, the World Economic Outlook, singled out inflation and a weakening of fiscal management as 'troubling features'.</p>

			<p>940830 FT  30 AUG 94 / MAI reviews actions by Lady Archer Lady Archer will not be 'precipitately' removed from the Anglia Television board, following disclosures about share orders placed by her husband, Lord Archer, according to a director of MAI, the company which bought Anglia in January. However MAI is reviewing Lady Archer's actions in the days prior to the January 18 public announcement of its takeover of Anglia. Directors want to reassure themselves that she followed normal corporate procedures, as laid down in Stock Exchange rules and the Companies Act, relating to spouse's share dealings and the protection of confidential price sensitive information. Lord Archer, a former Conservative party deputy chairman, placed orders to buy 50,000 Anglia shares on January 13 and January 14, netting an Pounds 80,000 profit for an acquaintance, Mr Broosk Saib, when they were sold on January 18. On January 12 Lady Archer attended an Anglia board meeting at which details were given for the first time of MAI's proposed takeover terms - although the Anglia board did not formally agree to the takeover until January 16. The MAI director said the company was following normal procedures in evaluating Lady Archer's actions. He repudiated any suggestion that the company action's might be politically motivated, pointing out that the Labour peer, Lord Hollick, had only one vote on MAI's board. Lord Archer's share orders were investigated by Department of Trade and Industry inspectors. After receiving their report the DTI last month decided to take no action against Lord Archer. Mr Robin Cook, the shadow trade secretary, yesterday wrote to Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, asking him to confirm that 'there would be no legal barrier to publication of the inspectors' report if Lord Archer, and others named in the report, were to give their consent to its release'.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Ways and means of strengthening OPEC were assessed  in today's meeting between Mr. Erwin Arrieta, Venezuelan energy  and mines minister, and Mr. Gholam Reza Aqazadeh, oil minister  of the Islamic Republic of Iran.    According to the Central News Unit, the need for greater  cooperation among OPEC members, in order to further mutual  economic interests, was stressed at the meeting.    Mr. Aqazadeh reiterated that Venezuela and five  oil-producing  countries of the Persian Gulf currently control two thirds of  oil reserves and 70 percent of exports. Despite the existence  of different points of view, they could take joint steps toward  the strengthening of OPEC, he said.    The Venezuelan mines and energy minister, who met Kuwaiti  oil  officials before meeting the oil officials of our country, has  said that, in order to achieve better prices, his country  supports a reduction in oil production.</p>

			<p><P> February 2, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> CHIEF JUSTICE STUMPS FOR STAMPS  </P> <P> Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist made a pitch today for more U.S. stamps  depicting past Supreme Court members as he helped dedicate a stamp  commemorating the court's 200th anniversary.  </P> <P> The new stamp depicts John Marshall, the fourth chief justice, whose likeness  has appeared on postage stamps three times previously.  </P> <P> "When it comes to members of the court who were not John Marshall, the pickings  are slim," Rehnquist said during a ceremony at a larger-than-life statue of  Marshall in the Supreme Court building.  </P> <P> Postmaster General Anthony M. Frank responded, "I get lobbied for stamps all  the time, but I have never been lobbied more graciously."  </P></p>

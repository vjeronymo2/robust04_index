			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Straight Talk" program with host Osvaldo Rodriguez and </F> guest Luis Sexto of BOHEMIA magazine -- live or recorded]    [Text] [Rodriguez] There are limits to rounding up foreign  currency inside Cuba: the population's sensibilities. We, Luis  Sexto of the magazine BOHEMIA and Osvaldo Rodriguez of the  newspaper JUVENTUD REBELDE, are going to talk about this today.  Well, Luis, I think this is a subject that is out in the  streets. I think that many of us -- in family gatherings and  among friends -- have discussed this subject, what is for sale  in certain stores within the network of stores that sell for  hard currency, and about the way certain Cuban businessmen, who  are seeking hard currency for the Cuban people, handle this  matter.    I think we should talk about this. We could delve more  deeply  into certain topics, and also into the intentions, but I think  intentions have always been noble. As I said upon opening the  program, I think a limit must be set, and that limit is to try  to avoid offending the population's sensibilities. I wouldn't  even say "try": the population's sensibilities simply must not  be offended.    [Sexto] I think, Osvaldo, that the limit has already been  set, unless the news I have is false. You are referring to the  fact that recently, in certain places, especially in the  capital, certain medicines were being sold; in others, certain  light foods, candies, sweets; even school uniforms came to be  sold in certain hard currency stores. Of course this represented  a huge contradiction, which was subsequently quickly caught and  repudiated by the population.    [Rodriguez] But you are speaking to me in the past tense. It  makes it sound as if all that is over.    [Sexto] Well, I understand that such a thing was not a  government decision. I mean, you have to keep in mind that in  this country, contrary to what some people both inside and  outside the country think, power is shared. In Cuba, power is  shared. But because of the cliches that have been established by  propaganda, people always think that anything that happens in  this country is a decision made at the highest level of  government or by the [Communist] Party [of Cuba]. People do not  take into account the fact that in this country, precisely,  power is so widely shared, so broadly distributed, that there is  enough margin for a businessman or an administrator at some  store to take certain initiatives that are often not the most  felicitous.    I have sometimes wished, precisely, that that power were  concentrated -- which does not mean centralization: wished to  have a concentrated power capable of making decisions, decisions  which would be obeyed, complied with, by everyone at once.    Now, I understand that when the government learned about  these things, the situation returned to normal and such sales  were prohibited, disallowed.    [Rodriguez] Well, yes, I think so. I believe you have  mentioned a number of cases that were prohibited. And, well, I  am thinking particulary about the sweet snacks for children, and  certain essential medicines that were being sold for hard  currency, but did not, at that particular moment, exist in the  hospitals or the pharmacies of the people's network. However, I  think there are other things that do a lot of damage to that  image as well, and that contrary to what we meant to do -- give  businessmen some autonomy -- we are realizing that certain  businessmen, when given autonomy, do not know what to do with  it, and begin taking initiatives that are irritating.    In principle, we defend autonomy, and could discuss this in  another program. We would have to draw the conclusion that ...  [rephrases] in my opinion, the efficiency of our economy entails  autonomy on the part of the enterprises in the economic sphere,  to be precise.    [Sexto] I agree.    [Rodriguez] That's on the one hand. Now, I think that when  our businessmen and administrators are given autonomy and don't  know what to do with it, it is because they are still suffering  the influence of a bureaucratic mentality to the maximum.    It seems to me that the other day -- last week, if my memory  serves me right -- Renato Recio touched on the subject of  bureaucracy and the bureaucratic mentality on this very program.  He reached the conclusion that bureacracy means losing sight of  the end goal.    As I was saying just a few moments ago, recalling Comrade  Renato Recio: When a process has lost sight of its end goal, it  has become bureaucratized. That means that its entire point has  been lost, that the thing is being done for no reason at all. It  is at that point that the purpose for which that action was  created, founded, begun is forgotten, and the action gets so far  off course that everything becomes distorted, and the man  carrying out that action no longer knows when he is taking  proper action and when he is taking improper action -- despite  the fact that he may have the best of intentions. We could also  talk about up to what point those intentions already...  [rephrases] are good intentions. Well, intentions are  intentions. It is said that the road to Hell is paved with good  intentions.    [Sexto] Indeed, with good intentions. Now, I want to tell  you  that, regardless of how flexible the economy and economic and  political management in this country may become, and regardless  of how much autonomy we may be able to give our institutions and  enterprises, we must never allow ourselves to cease acting as  political beings.    The society, this particular society, this regime, the  socialist regime -- at least the kind of socialism we in this  country want to build -- can never be separated from the  political vision of those who lead it. I mean: I cannot round up  hard currency at any cost. I have... [rephrases] the country  needs to round up hard currency. Indeed, the country has  needed... [rephrases] very clearly, it has taken initiatives  that, although... [rephrases] These initiatives may have  bothered us in the beginning because we saw or anticipated that  certain inequalities could arise. We could also see, however,  that they were necessary, that the nation was (?sunken) in an  extremely critical situation and needed to make bold decisions  that could alleviate our situation.    I think time has shown that the decision taken has been the  right one. Decriminalizing hard currency has helped, somewhat,  to alleviate certain tensions in the country.    Now of course we must not lose sight of the fact that no  management decision, administrative decision, can be allowed to  aggravate the possible irritation over the fact that some people  have access to hard currency while others do not. I mean that  must not be allowed to be an ostensibly hurtful act. Of course,  we cannot sell a medicine [for hard currency] because medicine  is a political product. We cannot sell a medicine in one place  for Cubans who possess hard currency and not sell it in a  pharmacy where it can be bought in Cuban pesos.    [Rodriguez] We must remind listeners that among the pillars,  one of the major foundations of this Revolution is public  health. Even under today's critical conditions, while it does  have deficiencies, public health is still free to the  population, and no one has yet died... [rephrases] there is not  a single person who can say: A hospital has failed to provide  care for me.    [Sexto] Indeed. Look, because of its social import, its  human  import, medicine is an eminently political product -- in  addition to everything else that it is, which I am not going to  get into defining here.    [Rodriguez] Of course.    [Sexto] And whoever sells medicine has to keep in mind,  above  all, its political implications. It would be... [rephrases] I  think it is unjust from the very foundation for us to allow the  absence of a medicine on the national currency market, but allow  it on the hard currency market.    [Rodriguez] Especially those medicines... [rephrases] for  example, asthma medicines. I remember that that was one of the  cases most talked about -- the fact that there was a spray  [preceding word in English] for asthma on certain markets. And  asthmatic people, at a period when... [rephrases] Everyone knows  that this time of year, winter, with its constant cold fronts,  is a time when asthma sufferers experience many attacks. Asthma  sufferers did not have that medicine available to them -- and I  think that was a very serious mistake on the part of whoever  made that decision. I think that, as you say, it was probably  some administrator, maybe some director of one of the many  enterprises supplying this network of stores, because no single  enterprise does it. Several enterprises service this network of  stores.    [Sexto] Osvaldo, in order to avoid becoming bureaucratic,  to avoid repeating hollow, harmful schemes, the first thing an  official has to do is not lose sight of the social purpose of  all his actions -- at least in our society.    [Rodriguez] Of course.    [Sexto] I mean: Why do I want to round up hard currency?  What  goal am I pursuing (?in rounding up) hard currency? The end  established in this country, of course, is a noble one, a noble  end.    [Rodriguez] We -- Luis Sexto, of BOHEMIA, and Osvaldo  Rodriguez of JUVENTUD REBELDE -- are discussing the matter of  rounding up hard currency inside Cuba. We have already  established the limit: not to offend the population's  sensibilities.    [Sexto] Indeed, that is the basic boundary. How far should  the manager's, administrator's, action go? To what extent can  management, or commercial flexibility and initiative be  positive? At what point does it begin to be negative? At what  point does it become impolitic? At what point does it begin to  cause irritation on the part of our citizens because of the  shortages they are already being affected by?    [Rodriguez] Of course this -- all these attitudes -- is also  to a certain extent related to the so-called depoliticizing of  the economy. I think that yes, one can to a certain extent speak  of economics alone, without relation to politics. When those  economics are put into practice, however... [rephrases] I mean:  You can talk about ideas, and about economic laws that operate  independently of will or of the social system. However, when you  go looking for that economy's end goal, that is when politics  merges with economics, and that is where these businessmen have  to act, taking into account not only economic ideas -- the ideas  of businessmen -- but also political ideas.    [Sexto] I think what you are saying is obvious: In a society  based on social justice -- that is, equitable distribution of  wealth and a standard of security for all -- indidputably, for  the majority of the population, economics can never be divorced  from politics. I think that is one of the many taboos that have  arisen recently in certain places in the world; and, in fact, we  already know where such a divorce -- that artificial divorce  between economics and politics -- is leading. Socialist  societies are profoundly humane societies, and in my opinion,  politics is nothing more than the art of getting human beings to  live together in harmony. Therefore, we cannot forget the  political implications of all our economic actions. That is what  I am talking about, Osvaldo. However, I think that we also have  to talk about other things here, in the few moments left to us.    I think there are many Cubans who indeed may have hard  currency available to them today, for one reason or another. But  I also think that those Cubans who today have access to -- or  rather, the right to use -- that hard currency must try to be  very careful not to offend the sensibilities of their fellow  citizens, because that problem too is occurring. We are not  going to criticize, here on our program, only officials who, by  making certain decisions, have made a mistake. I think that this  society must also seek harmony on the basis of us, ourselves, on  the basis of each and every one of its members. I know, for  example, of schools where compared to the snack of a child whose  family receives hard currency, the snack of a child whose family  doesn't, is awful. I mean: Although we have had to accept these  relationships because of the situation, because of the  circumstances, let us at least not make them worse by using...  [rephrases] vanities that are, in the last analysis, puerile  vanities, vanities that try to create artificial differences. In  the last analysis, this country was founded for us all, and we  must all contribute our share so we can manage to live together  in social harmony.    I believe -- and continue to repeat -- that at the present  time, morality is far more important than under any other  circumstances. In times of crisis, morality is fundamental. And  that is what I am talking about right now, Osvaldo. I am saying  that we must try not to be ostentatious.    [Rodriguez] To avoid offending the sensibilities of the  population -- that is the boundary to keep in mind in rounding  up hard currency inside Cuba.    I think that we have spoken out quite clearly on this  matter,  Luis Sexto of the magazine BOHEMIA and I, Osvaldo Rodriguez of  JUVENTUD REBELDE.    Luis, all that is left for us to say to our listeners is  that  we should continue talking about this subject. I don't think we  have exhausted this topic here. We could discuss it further in  later programs.</p>

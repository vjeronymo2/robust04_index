			<p>BFN     [Text] Nissan Motor Company will lower the export price  for "Maxima," the passenger car to be sold in the United States  beginning on 13 May, by about 6 percent for its lowest-priced  model. The reduction has been done by changing components.    As a result of the sharp appreciation of the yen in the past  one to two years, Japanese companies have been forced to lower  their selling local prices, and have been losing grounds to the  U.S.-made cars. The new pricing strategy of Nissan this time  means it is giving priority to winning "price competitiveness"  even in the U.S. market, and this is likely to impact on other  Japanese manufacturers too.    The new model of Maxima will be equipped with a remodeled  3,000-cc engine. While safety features of the car have been  improved by putting airbags on both driver's and front  passenger's seats as standard equipment, remote-controlled  doorlocks and aluminum wheels have become optional, becoming  available at real cost prices if wanted by buyers. Additional  cost savings have been done by making some parts interchangeable  and adopting new technologies.    The price for the lowest-priced automatic base-model car is  $20,999, which is about $1,400 (6.4 percent) less than the  current model. A manually driven base model, priced under  $20,000, has become available as well.    Nissan's action this time is aimed at impressing the  would-be  buyers with the low price of the car by simplifying some of the  components. But it can be interpreted also as a change in the  Japanese car manufacturer's policy -- going back from making  larger and deluxe cars to making low-priced cars.</p>

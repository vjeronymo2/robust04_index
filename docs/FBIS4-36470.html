			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Political correspondent Gadi Sukenik video report] </F>   [Text] Prime Minister Rabin this evening attacked both the  Likud and 'Arafat on the East Jerusalem letter issue. He said  that the PLO chairman was lying when he spoke about the issue in  Johannesburg. Rabin told our correspondent Gadi Sukenik a short  time ago that no attempt was made to conceal anything in the  Jerusalem letter issue. Rabin says that 'Arafat's remarks  constituted a fallacious attempt to create a link between the  interim arrangement in the territories and East Jerusalem.  Rabin added that whatever is taking place in Jerusalem at the  present time is none of the PLO's concern. Rabin added that if  Faysal al-Husayni resides in Jerusalem and occupies Orient House  he will not be a member of the Palestinian Authority, because a  total separation will be preserved between the autonomy areas  and East Jerusalem:    [Begin Rabin recording] Wherein did 'Arafat lie? He said he  received a letter from us, but no letter was addressed to him  regarding Israel's policy in East Jerusalem during the interim  arrangement period. Two, he said this issue was linked to the  Gaza-Jericho First agreement. This issue was not raised in any  form or shape in the negotiations we held with 'Arafat during my  visit to Cairo. Three, 'Arafat tried -- with the Likud's help  -- to link the letter sent to the Norwegian foreign minister  explaining our policy -- as publicly described by the foreign  minister in the Knesset -- to the Gaza-Jericho First agreement  or to the interim arrangement. This is all a lie, and this is  what Minister Shahal said. [end recording]</p>

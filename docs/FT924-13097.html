			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / Quality award for Rank Xerox RANK XEROX, the office equipment group, has become first winner of the European Quality Award - Europe's answer to the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award in the US, writes Paul Taylor. The award has been set up by the European Foundation for Quality Management to promote use of Total Quality Management theory in European companies. Rank Xerox was presented with the award in Madrid by King Juan Carlos. Mr Bernard Fournier, managing director, said: 'This reflects the efforts of 28,000 Rank Xerox employees across Europe who, for eight years, have increased customer satisfaction and regained market share by employing quality principles and practices.' The company was one of four nominees, each a winner of a European Quality Prize. The others are BOC Group's UK-based Special Gases business, Industrias del Ubierna, the Spanish-based steel wire, cord and fibre company of Belgium's NV Bekaert group, and European subsidiaries of Milliken, the US textile manufacturer.</p>

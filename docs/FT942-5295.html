			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / Inflation rises in Turkey Turkey's hopes of achieving its austerity targets have been dealt a blow with publication of the latest inflation figures, which could undermine government efforts to win union restraint in the current public sector wage negotiations, writes John Murray Brown in Istanbul. Annual consumer price inflation last month rose to 117 per cent, compared with 107 per cent in April, after a 24 per cent increase in April had followed the announcement of one-off price rises in state-controlled commodities such as petrol and sugar. The government's austerity programme, announced on April 5, aims to halve the budget deficit to the equivalent of Dollars 2.8bn (Pounds 1.85bn) in 1994, on the basis of a 15 per cent real cut in wages across the economy and annualised inflation in the second half of this year at about 30 per cent. The latest figures, announced at the weekend by the state institute of statistics, suggest that, four months into the crisis, some companies are only now adjusting prices to compensate for slower sales and squeezed margins. The latest increases, higher than the official forecast of 7 per cent, will make it more difficult for the government to hold the line on wages, and thus could imperil the fiscal reduction targets on which Turkey is negotiating for a stand-by facility with the International Monetary Fund.</p>

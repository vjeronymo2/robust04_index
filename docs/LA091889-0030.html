			<p><P> September 18, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEWS;  </P> <P> DIZZY GILLESPIE DOES 'A NIGHT IN HAVANA'  </P> <P> There's an unasked question hovering over Don Holland's "A Night in Havana:  Dizzy Gillespie in Cuba" (at the Nuart through Tuesday) that casts an  unfortunate shadow over an otherwise infectious documentary on the great jazz  trumpeter's 1985 trip to Cuba to headline the fifth International Jazz Festival  of Havana.  </P> <P> Gillespie himself provides the perfect opening for that question when, at the  beginning of the film, he offers that he is the only member of his contingent  who feels comfortable visiting Cuba in the light of so much long-held American  hostility toward Castro. Why didn't off-screen interviewer Allen Honigberg ask  him why he felt this way? Why didn't Honigberg then proceed to the heart of the  matter, which would have been to ask Gillespie what he thinks about Cuba's  sorry history in regard to human rights, and those of minorities in particular.  The question really is pertinent because Gillespie does bring up the oppression  of blacks in America and because he is made to look naive when he remarks that  in contrast to Cuba during the corrupt Batista regime, "Havana now looks so  peaceful."  </P> <P> You have to believe Dizzy Gillespie is too sophisticated not to know the score  about the history of freedom of expression under Castro and not to take too  seriously the dictator's expansive personal welcome. Gillespie in fact emerges  as an extremely shrewd, warm and wise man who enjoys an enviable harmony with  himself that is reflected in his wonderfully mellow music.  </P> <P> He is clearly an ambassador of good will par excellence who takes great  pleasure in connecting with his musical roots, explaining that the drum, which  is at the heart of African music and culture, was forbidden to slaves in the  United States while blacks transported to Cuba were allowed to keep theirs. The  entire film depicts Gillespie enthusiastically making cross-cultural  connections, bringing pleasure to thousands of Cubans with his music, famed for  its innovative Afro-Cuban motifs, and discovering in a performance of the  Folklorico National an exuberant preservation of African traditions.  </P> <P> "A Night in Havana" (Times-rated Family) concludes with Gillespie bringing his  remarkable band together with that of a contingent of Cuban musicians,  including pianist Gonzalo Rubalcaba. It is a joyous, thrilling synthesis, one  that Gillespie hoped to repeat in New York only last month. But Rubalcaba and  his band sadly were denied visas by the State Department.KEVIN THOMAS  </P></p>

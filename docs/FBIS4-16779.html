			<p>BFN     [Text] Russia's Choice leader Yegor Gaydar has warned  against offsetting inter-enterprise debt. Talking to journalists  in Samara he said that any attempt to weaken the monetary policy  will as a rule have result in the opposite of what was  envisaged. Ukraine had often offset such debt and the result  was one of the most critical financial situations in the CIS.  In the Baltic states such steps had never been taken and there  the debt problem was much less acute, said Gaydar.    He said that defaulting was an indicator of financial  responsibility. "If there was a high level of responsibility,  defaulting is high. One can refrain from paying and put one's  money in a bank or commercial structure and receive a profit."  He said this was impossible in countries with strict bankrupt  legislation and a high level of real responsibility. Gaydar  also considers the government to be to blame. "This concerns the  defaulting of the government itself and its non-fulfillment of  obligations -- a line actively pursued by the Chernomyrdin  cabinet since the beginning of 1993," said Gaydar.    He said that serious changes in the present tax system can  only be based, in the first place, on real cut-backs in  government expenditure and, in the second, on the gradual  lowering of profit tax and the gradual raising of tax on natural  resources, land and property.    On the decision to unify the Russian and Belarusian monetary  systems, Gaydar said that a series of principal conditions had  been accepted in Belarus (in contrast to the initial draft) and  that Belarus would win a considerable amount from the agreement,  e.g. equal prices for energy and access to the stable Russian  currency. Russia is widening its market. In addition, it will  not have to pay any lease for military units stationed in  Belarus. However, Gaydar said that one point did give him cause  for concern: Private individuals will be able to exchange  Belarusian rubles for Russian rubles at a rate of one to one for  the first two hundred thousand in cash and for the first million  in bank accounts. As there is about 60 million dollars in cash  circulation in Belarus, this would result in the circulation  increasing to 1.5 billion dollars. Thus, Gaydar said, Russia  would be making Belarus a gift of two trillion rubles. This does  not take into account bank savings. The main thing, according  to Gaydar, is that the possibilities for financial speculation  will increase massively at a cost of many trillions of rubles  for the Russian economy.</p>

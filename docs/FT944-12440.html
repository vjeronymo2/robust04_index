			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / Survey of Australia (7): Trade wind shifts - Pacific is now the main focus Mr Paul Keating, the Australian prime minister, is trying to transform the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (Apec) forum from a talking shop to an effective grouping of countries that feel they have been the victims of strong-arm trade tactics. His latest mission has involved weeks of intense negotiations aimed at getting Apec members to establish a free trade zone in the Asia-Pacific region by 2020. There is a hint of impatience in Mr Keating's time-frame. He would like an agreement to be reached in principle during the Apec leaders' November meeting in Bogor, Indonesia. If he succeeds,Apec would become more than an obscure acronym for another bloc of countries trading primarily in raw materials. For Australia, a completely liberalised trading regime would further strengthen its presence in the region. Companies hope free trade will also lead to a freer investment climate, thus opening opportunities for greater participation in Asia's booming equity markets. Mr Bob Lim, director of economic analysis at the Business Council of Australia, the main employers' body, says uniform rules will provide a quick way to the regional securities market. 'Australian companies will be more comfortable with greater transparency and disclosure rules, and with uniform accounting and other operating standards,' he says. Mr Keating's free trade proposal has been received favourably among the Association of South-East Asia Nations (ASEAN). An internal Apec committee had originally recommended a start-up date 10 years later than Mr Keating's proposed 2010. President Soeharto of Indonesia, who will chair the November meeting, has pledged to place the issue at the top of the Bogor agenda. Indonesia, which traditionally had the tightest trading regime among ASEAN members, acknowledges that only by opening up its trade and investment doors can his country's economic growth be sustained. Mr Goh Chok Tong, the Singapore prime minister, who is an avowed free trader, favours an even earlier date - 1998 - for introducing free trade in the region. The Canberra-based ASEAN-Australia Business Council said the Apec move will push forward the ASEAN Free Trade Agreement (AFTA), which began last year. 'The time-table for Apec's phase-in roughly corresponds to that of AFTA, and the wider Apec membership will bring greater advantages to ASEAN countries,' the council said. The accelerated time-table has a built-in sweetener for the developing member countries. According to the Business Council, the preferred Apec schedule is for developed countries to dismantle all barriers by 2000, newly industrialised countries, such as Singapore, by 2005, and developing countries, such as Indonesia, by 2010. The idea of Apec was first proposed in January 1989 by Mr Bob Hawke, the former Australian prime minister, and Mr Keating, then federal treasurer. The politicians, with tacit backing from Australian business, have decided to link Australia's future economic prosperity and political stability with development in Asia. The increasingly strong ties with the region have helped to cushion the decline in Australian trade with traditional partners in Europe. The Asian members of Apec have absorbed an increasing proportion of Australian exports. Last year, more than 60 per cent of Australian exports went to these countries, compared with only 26 per cent in 1960. Exports to the European Union nations have declined to 13 per cent of total exports last year, from the 50 per cent level in the 1960s. The agricultural subsidy war between the EU and the US, which could not be controlled under Gatt, also had serious implications for Apec. Australia and other agricultural exporters have been thwarted by the high protective wall built around the EU and the US. Australia was vulnerable because the subsidies had encroached on its traditional outlets for wheat, one of its largest foreign exchange earners. Using whatever influence it had, the Australian Labor government had sought to get together some of the trading underdogs for a more effective collective lobbying. It was instrumental in the formation of the Cairns Group, which consists of non-subsidising exporters, mostly from developing countries. The Cairns Group secured a hearing during during the Uruguay Round of the Gatt talks, but by the close of the 1980s it was obvious that the US and Japan also had to be involved to make an impression on the importing countries. The historic deal struck last December at the end of the seven-year Uruguay Round placated, albeit momentarily, the free traders. Australia stood to gain an additional ADollars 5bn (USDollars 3.7bn) in annual exports from the range of subsidy and tariff cuts agreed upon. Mr Keating, at the time, claimed the agreement would result in an ADollars 1bn increase in agricultural exports. Wheat sales were expected to rise by ADollars 250m because the deal would slash the amount of subsidised wheat on world markets by nearly 50m tonnes between 1995 and 2000. However, the recent delays in the ratification of the Gatt accords has again underlined the need to strengthen Apec. Mr Keating moved quickly and spent much of August and September cajoling important Apec players to give a political commitment to the promotion of the free trade. On a visit to Tokyo last month, Mr Keating appealed to the ideological leanings of Mr Tomiichi Murayama, Japan's new socialist prime minister, in order to win a half-nod. Mr Murayama reacted by offering to back regional free trade. However, he pragmatically advocated extreme caution.</p>

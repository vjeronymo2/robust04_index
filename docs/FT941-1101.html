			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: UK electricity Including purchases made this week, Eastern Electricity has now bought back around 3 per cent of its own shares. That shows a certain confidence in the future, despite the recent nerves of the market. It also shrugs off the uncertainty surrounding the review of regional electricity companies currently being conducted by Offer, the industry regulator. Eastern's confidence looks well placed. The Recs' shares have fallen in response to weakness in the gilt market, yet valuing Recs as quasi-fixed interest stocks is a mistake. Real dividend growth will be at least 15 per cent over the next two years. And as Offer's review seems to be running along pragmatic lines, a deal may emerge which inflicts sufficient financial pain on the Recs to appease the critics, yet is insufficient to tempt any of the companies to appeal to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. That would still leave real dividend growth of 7 to 8 per cent until the end of the decade. There is also plenty of hidden value waiting to be unearthed. Demerger of the National Grid is only a matter of time. Many of the Recs are now completely ungeared, yet the review may well leave the companies generating cash. Predators, particularly those with an advance corporation tax problem, may well be tempted to buy a Rec once the review is over. Much of the purchase price could be funded by injecting debt into the Rec or issuing long term bonds, secured on the Recs cash flows or assets. Some Recs will substantially reform their own capital structures to avoid such a fate. But either way, shareholders can only benefit. A canny bidder would act now, before prices rise.</p>

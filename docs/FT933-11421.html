Mr Kay Whitmore, chairman, said the second-quarter and first-half results were a 'satisfactory beginning' consistent with the company's plan to improve its performance this year. 'We continue to believe the company will generate moderately higher sales this year, solid earnings from operations, and positive cash-flow.' He also reported 'good progress on development of plans that will improve our operating effectiveness, our cash flows and our ability to pay down debt'. Kodak has already announced plans to spin off its Eastman Chemical business. Second-quarter net earnings of Dollars 371m, or Dollars 1.13 a share, compared with Dollars 361m, or Dollars 1.11, in the same period last year. The figures were held back by Dollars 12m of extraordinary charges for the early retirement of debt and include Dollars 79m in earnings from Eastman Chemical. Sales totalled Dollars 4.27bn, against Dollars 4.29bn. Mr Whitmore described the results as 'better than expected', and the company's shares rose Dollars 1 3/8 to close at Dollars 52 3/8 on Wall Street. Encouraging signs, he added, were an excellent operating margin of nearly 24 per cent in the imaging business and improvement in the rate of earnings in the information operations, from a negative 3 per cent a year ago to a positive 5 per cent in the most recent quarter. For the six months, the company suffered a loss of Dollars 1.65bn, or Dollars 5.05, after first-quarter charges of Dollars 2.17bn for accounting changes. In the first half of last year it made Dollars 506m, or Dollars 1.56.</p>

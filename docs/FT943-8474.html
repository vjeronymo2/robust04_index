			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / Arts: Beer, bonhomie and bebop - Brecon Jazz Festival At 8:30 on Friday evening, at the same time as I was pressing between the ranks of Krukke, the Dutch marching band, to gain assess to the Guildhall and the Human Chain within, octogenarian altoist Benny Carter was preparing to join Saxomania in the Market Hall. Meanwhile, swinging bassist Ray Brown was already warming up a trio in Christ College. Across town, the open air bandstands emanated a mixture of trad, mainstream and the smell of myriad griddles. Two hours old and Brecon Jazz was already cooking. In prospect was a feast of attractions including Slide Hampton, George Shearing and Jon Faddis as well as a packed 'stroller' programme with gems like tenorist Andy Hamilton or clarinettist Kenny Daverne teamed with trumpeter Warren Vache. The cleverly contrived anarchy of Django Bates' small band set the tone well for the fringe aspect of the best little festival in the UK. Bates himself alternated crazily between peck horn and trashy sounding electric keyboard, his quartet's eccentric sound describing a tableau of circus and music hall quirkiness. Frenetic songs with titles like 'Food For Plankton' and 'Dancing on Frith St' were tossed between saxophonist Iain Bellamy and the leader making a delicious musical nonsense from the clouds of notes and manic rhythmic complexity. On Saturday afternoon the same space was filled with the exhilarating sound and spectacle of the Trevor Watts Moire Music Drum Orchestra. Consisting of a battery of Ghanaian traditional drums, a supercharged but otherwise straight kit, a bubbling fretless bass and an unstoppable soprano sax, the orchestra was an overflowing cauldron of colourful energy. For two blissful hours waves of percussive patterns flowed from congas and djembe, carried on rolling basslines. Weaving a continuous line of improvisation throughout, Watts remained seated and serene behind white beard and granny specs. The counterpoint of mbira thumb pianos and crisscrossing of flute with soprano sax in Ghanaian folk tunes was exquisite and the booming version of Rocky Road to Dublin, quite extraordinary. A couple of hours' interval to munch a taco accompanied by the flamenco washed guitar of Eduardo Niebla at the Museum Car Park bandstand was all that was needed to make the geographical leap from West Africa to the US, via Panama. Assembled in the Market Hall was the New York Latin Jazz Allstars led by pianist Danilo Perez. Directed by Perez and propelled by Ignacio Berroa (drums) and Larry Grenadier (bass), ace Cuban altoist Paquito D'Rivera, Brazilian trumpeter - Claudio Roditi and rising young tenor star David Sanchez picked up where Dizzy Gillespie's UN Big Band left off. Battling with BBC technicians for attention (the view of the music was obscured by three cameramen and a constantly swinging 25ft jib which some of the audience found hard to take), the Allstars won through, but only just, with spreading rhythms and radiant solos from the leaders. Guitarist Jim Hall, appearing in the tranquil setting of the Christ College theatre, had no such interference. So distilled is the guitarist's technique and so pure the semi-acoustic sound that on such a day - long and full of hot jazz - he might have trod the wrong side of the thin line between elevation and enervation. But, first in duet with protege Peter Bernstein and then unobtrusively backed by Allan Ganley (drums) and Dave Green (bass), Hall applied his understated and intimate technique to a series of shimmering pieces from Lunceford to Gilberto and finally his old boss Rollins. Outside, in the sunshine, Brecon continued to boil over with beer, bonhomie and bebop. Roll on next August.</p>

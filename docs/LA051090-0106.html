			<p><P> May 10, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> STATE JUNIOR COLLEGE SOFTBALL TOURNAMENT;  </P> <P> MOORPARK'S THOMAS FILLS IN THE BLANKS AGAINST MT. SAC, 2-0  </P> <P> Chris Singer's solo home run was all the Moorpark College softball team needed,  which was fortunate for the Lady Raiders because offensively that was about all  they had.  </P> <P> Moorpark managed only two hits, but pitcher Robin Thomas shut down visiting Mt.  San Antonio College on Wednesday in Moorpark's 2-0 win in the first round of  the Southern California regional of the state tournament.  </P> <P> In another first-round game, 15th-seeded Antelope Valley (15-20) was eliminated  by second-seeded Cypress, 1-0. Host Cypress scored the game's only run in the  third inning.  </P> <P> Third-seeded Moorpark (27-9) advanced to a best-of-three second-round matchup  against Cerritos.  </P> <P> Moorpark will follow Thomas' guide throughout the playoffs. Thomas (25-6), a  freshman right-hander, has earned the decision in all but five of Moorpark's  games, and Coach Will Thurston plans to rely on her even more, if possible,  during the tournament.  </P> <P> Thurston, who calls pitching depth the team's "weak link," said, "For us to be  able to get in the final, we're going to have to get three strong games from  (Thomas)."  </P> <P> Thomas cruised until the fifth when 14th-seeded Mt. SAC (18-17) opened with two  consecutive singles and had runners at second and third with one out.  </P> <P> Moorpark led, 1-0, at that point, and Thomas retired the next two batters on a  strikeout and groundout to end the threat. She stranded three more runners in  the final two innings and called her dropball her most effective pitch.  </P> <P> "I felt really confident today," said Thomas, who drove in Jamie Heggen with  Moorpark's second run on a single to left in the sixth.  </P> <P> Thomas allowed six singles and two walks, both intentional. The walks were  issued to Carrie Evans, who hit a grand slam when Mt. SAC overcame a four-run  deficit to defeat Moorpark earlier in the season.  </P> <P> "There's no way I'm going to allow our team to get beat by that girl a second  time," Thurston said.  </P> <P> Singer's two-out home run in the second put Moorpark ahead to stay.  </P> <P> Moorpark's softball field doesn't have a fence, and Singer simply kept running  after hooking a line drive down the left-field line. She had reached third base  by the time the left-fielder reached the ball.  </P></p>

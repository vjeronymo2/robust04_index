According to official information, aspects of bilateral  relations were discussed, and so was further economic  cooperation regarding implementation of the instructions of the  Supreme Council of Ukraine on ratification of the START I Treaty.    To a question from an UNIAN correspondent, Viktor Stelmakh,  press secretary of the president of Ukraine, replied, that "the  meeting was of an essentially confidential nature and not a  single agreement was signed." The U.S. Embassy in Ukraine  refused a request to comment on the results of this  conversation, referring to a lack of authority on the part of  the embassy's leadership.    Anton Buteyko, head of the service of the president of  Ukraine on international issues, who was present at the talks,  explained that the meeting had been brought about by the  telephone conversation between Leonid Kravchuk and [U.S.  President] Bill Clinton regarding ratification of the START I  Treaty. William Miller and Leonid Kravchuk discussed the course  of implementation of accords on the matter of nuclear  disarmament and ways of improving economic cooperation and  exchanged opinions on a wide range of issues. The U.S.  ambassador reported on America's attitude to the ratification of  the START I Treaty.    The diplomatic circles of the world are noting the equivocal  reaction of the American leadership to Ukraine's attitude to  nuclear disarmament. In particular, commenting on the talks of  U.S. Vice-President Albert Gore in Kyrgyzstan, U.S. information  agencies are stressing that Kazakhstan and Belarus recently  ratified the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Western  commentators are venturing the opinion that [a visit] to Kiev is  not envisaged among the planned visits of the U.S. President and  Vice-President for the near future namely because Ukraine's  stance is different from the Belarusian and Kazakh stance. They  have a calmer attitude to this matter at the Ukraine Ministry of  Foreign Affairs. One of the employees of the foreign policy  department commented, "This is normal diplomatic practice,  acceptable in all states. Remember if you will the postponement  of Boris Yeltsin's visit to Japan or the visits of the  presidents of Romania and Bulgaria to Ukraine."</p>

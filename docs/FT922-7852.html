			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / Hanson profits fall 17% midway HANSON, the Anglo-US conglomerate, yesterday reported a 17 per cent fall in pre-tax profits for the half year, making it harder for the group to continue its record of 28 years of earnings growth. Shares fell on the news to close 9p down at 232 1/2 p. For the six months to March 31, pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 588m to Pounds 488m, which the company blamed on a fall in net interest receivable from Pounds 103m to Pounds 44m and the absence of a Pounds 68m profit on disposal of natural resources assets. Trading profits were up marginally at Pounds 464m compared with Pounds 459m. Sales increased from Pounds 3.9bn to Pounds 4.4bn. Lord White, chairman of Hanson Industries in the US, confirmed that the group was looking to buy a core business. 'The outlook for acquisitions is favourable,' he said. 'Recently we have begun to see some signs of recovery in North America and improvement in our early cycle building products and consumer companies.' The integration of Beazer, the aggregates and building business, was largely responsible for an Pounds 880m increase in provisions for liabilities which rose to Pounds 4.5bn. Net borrowings were Pounds 1.59bn which have recently been reduced by the Pounds 132m sale of Hanson's UK and Irish Ever Ready companies and the Pounds 280m sale of its 2.8 per cent shareholding in Imperial Chemical Industries. Mr Derek Bonham, chief executive, said there were likely to be more disposals to bring down net borrowings which he would like to eliminate. The worst hit US business was SCM Chemicals which reported a 36 per cent drop in profit as average selling prices for titanium dioxide fell 9 per cent. Profits from chemicals were down from Pounds 72m to Pounds 46m. A full six-month profit from Cavenham Forest Industries boosted the overall profits of forest products from Pounds 13m to Pounds 34m. In the UK, Imperial Tobacco continued to increase profits from Pounds 124m to Pounds 131m. Fully diluted earnings per share were down 12 per cent to 8.3p from 9.4p. From July 1 dividends will be paid quarterly, the first payment amounting to 2.75p and subsequent dividends being not less than that amount. Lex, Page 20</p>

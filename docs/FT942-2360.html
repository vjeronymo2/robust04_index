			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / Architecture: In worship of Pugin / Review of the new exhibition at the V and A Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin was a phenomenon. Born in 1812 he was dead only forty years later, by which time he had married three times, produced eight children, designed the interior of the Houses of Parliament - including every stick of furniture, built several Roman Catholic cathedrals and churches, and almost single-handedly inspired the Gothic Revival in English architecture and decoration. His manic energy was combined with intense discipline and a deep but simple convert's catholic faith. He was a genius with passion. But his work has never received the level of appreciation it deserves. That is about to be put right at the exhibition that has just opened at London's Victoria and Albert Museum. 'Pugin - A Gothic Passion' is sponsored by Pearson plc, whose interests include the Financial Times, and runs until September 11. The exhibition succeeds in being a sumptuous treat, while gently presenting a scholarly account of a life devoted to a creative mission. Historically Pugin suffered from the dislike of Ruskin and the kind of intellectual isolation that is often handed out to creative artists by their immediate successors. The exhibition at the V and A is exceptionally ambitious, not only because of its scale but also because it has involved years of original research and detective work to track down some 400 artefacts. To display them all in such a way that they can illuminate the progress of Pugin's life and work is not easy. The task of designing the exhibition was given to the architects John Outram and Jeremiah Sheehan, who have created from the fairly basic set of exhibition rooms a series of dramatic and evocative spaces. They have also devised a way of making great collages of Pugin's patterns - using computer technology in a way that Pugin, had he been practising now, would surely have devised himself. The usual problem of architectural exhibitions is the absence of the actual buildings. In Pugin's case this is more than compensated for by the sheer proligacy of his furniture, ecclesiastical ornaments, wallpapers, materials and ceramics. Pugin must have dreamt patterns. This exhibition shows above everything else that he was a master of flat pattern, and that without Pugin there could have been no William Morris designs. When you step into the first room you are confronted by a huge version of a drawing of a gothic church. This was drawn in 1821 when Pugin was nine. It shows what was in his mind as a child, and he went on to become a prodigy designer by fulfilling a commission for some furniture for Windsor Castle when he was only fifteen. Some of this furniture is on show, but the great Pugin sideboard was destroyed in the Windsor fire of 1992. Pugin's early passion for the Gothic was not a stylistic obsession but a conviction that Gothic was an architecture of principle. It was the only architecture that represented truth to materials and offered the opportunity of true craftsmanship as a form of Christian worship. The exhibition is liberally strung with texts and Puginian aphorisms - one of the most typical is his statement: 'There is nothing worth living for but Christian architecture and a boat.' The sea and sailing were his other passion and from his home in Ramsgate he frequently sailed to London, or to France, for his sketching and antique collecting trips. He worked on board his various boats and always dressed in practical sailing clothes, even on land. He clearly responded to the ship-shape order of life at sea and he ordered his own extraordinary working life with as much precision as the captain of a ship. Pugin's greatest monument is the Palace of Westminster where he worked with Charles Barry on the interiors and furnishings. The throne from the House of Lords dominates this section of the V and A. Much of the medieval mummery and flummery of Parliament must be put down to the effect of Pugin's Gothic dream world upon our legislators. Pugin himself said of his life and work: 'I indulged in a sort of Catholic utopia.' It is his influence upon the church that provides the exhibition with its finest display. The re-creation of a church interior is at the heart of the display - you can rest on a Pugin pew to absorb the quality of the sort of ecclesiastical stage set that he saw as the setting for the Mass. It is more than a medieval revival because of the intention behind it to convince the emerging nineteenth century that heaven was going to be a Gothic dream. The quality of the metalwork, vestments and embroideries here is incredible. Beyond this Gothic extravaganza lay a lot of stern messages - and these are most often realised in the furniture which bears out Pugin's strictures about truth to materials and simplicity of construction. It will come as a surprise to discover that Pugin was the pioneer of 'flat-pack' furniture. There are some tenuous links made by the V and A with 20th century designers, who may have learned from Pugin - I suspect most of them had never heard of him. You end your tour of the exhibition with a visit to a reconstruction of the Medieval Court from the Great Exhibition of 1851. This does not succeed as well as the rest of the exhibition, perhaps because the whole of Pugin's life and work is itself such a miracle that the display of it at the V and A deserves the title of a great exhibition for itself. The exhibition is open from 10 00 to 17 30 Tuesday to Sunday and from noon to 17 30 on Mondays, until September 11. There is no catalogue as such but a special book of essays has been published by Yale University Press to coincide with the show - price Pounds 19.95. A private view of the exhibition for Financial Times readers will be held on Thursday, July 14 at 6.30-8.30. Tickets, Pounds 10 each, from Louise Gordon-Foxwell on 071 873 3563</p>

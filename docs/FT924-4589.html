			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / Tyne &amp; Wear steel strikers reject deal WORKERS at a steelrolling mill at Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, yesterday rejected a deal to end a five-month strike. Production at Spartan Redheugh, part of GM Firth, the steel stockholding group, has been at a standstill since July when management took steps to sweep away a bonus system it described as 'archaic' and introduce more flexible working practices. The strikers, members of the AEEU electricians' and engineering workers' union and the Iron and Steel Trades Confederation, claim they were faced with pay cuts of up to 25 per cent. Acrimony increased when the company advertised for a new manual workforce. Nobody has so far been recruited. The proposed package of terms and conditions was negotiated between the unions and management with help from Acas, the conciliation service. The strikers said they had rejected the proposal because it would mean 45 redundancies and included unacceptable preconditions. Mr Peter Scarff, director of operations at Spartan Redheugh, said the plan would have meant no more than 15 redundancies and would have given the manual workforce a minimum wage of Pounds 6.50 per hour. In exchange the company wanted to introduce new working practices, he said. Union officials are understood to have believed that the package was the best obtainable.</p>

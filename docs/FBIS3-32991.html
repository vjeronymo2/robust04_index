			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Nicanor Leon Cotayo for PRENSA LATINA] </F>   [Excerpt] Havana [No date or news agency attribution as  received] -- New information would seem to corroborate that  small isolated groups acting in Havana on behalf of human rights  are being financed from abroad and, whenever necessary, work in  harmony with individuals who promote terrorism.    International news agencies reported on Wednesday [9  February] that specific groups, made up of persons of Cuban  descent and operating in Miami, asked the U.S. Government to  provide $500,000 to the island's "dissident movement."    According to a spokesman for these groups, quoted by the  sources, the request was made officially to Alexander Watson,  the U.S. assistant secretary of state for inter-American  affairs, during a meeting they held in Miami last month.    The "dissidents" would use the money, the spokesperson  noted,  to acquire equipment to receive information and guidance from  abroad. Such equipment could include fax machines and satellite  reception dishes.    The spokesman concluded by saying that they had not received  any official answer from the State Department, at least as of  the time of the meeting. [sentence as received]    A spokeswoman for the State Department did not want to  comment on the issue, nor did she confirm if in fact Watson had  accepted the request.    The Spanish news agency EFE recalled that these small groups  moving in Havana, under the Reagan and Bush administrations,  received funds from an agency whose budget is approved by the  U.S. Congress: The National Endowment for Democracy [previous  name in English].    Toward the end of January, 1992, other news sources reported  that this same organization "aided in bringing about the end of  communism in Eastern Europe." The group later sponsored seven  projects related to Cuba and allocated $500,000 of its overall  budget to activities directed at the island. That figure is  almost double the amount approved in 1990.    Now, just 48 hours before a spokesperson reported the  aforementioned request, U.S. authorities discovered a ship off  the coast of Florida carrying a large amount of weapons and  money, presumably headed for the island's so called "internal  opposition." According to THE MIAMI HERALD, the vessel, and its  seven passengers, were carrying 50 rifles and pistols, about  25,000 rounds of ammunition, and "a few thousand dollars in  cash." The HERALD states that Rodolfo Frometa, a member of the  terrorist Alpha 66 organization, was the mission's leader. The  mission's target was to land a commando team on Cuban soil.    Some recalled that the U.S. Coast Guard intercepted another  group of Cuban subversives in the area last Spring. The Coast  Guard follows a government order issued by the Clinton  administration rejecting this type of illegal activity.    On 29 December, 1991, Cuban authorities captured three  heavily armed men carrying explosives, whose mission was to  contact the leaders of these small groups -- who call themselves  defenders of human rights -- as well as carrying out terrorist  operations.    More recently, during the third Ibero-American summit in  Salvador de Bahia, Brazil, in 1993, the Brazilian police  reported the possibility of a plot to assassinate Fidel Castro.  Personalities who openly and systematically encourage  "dissident" activities in Cuba were reportedly linked to the  plot. [passage omitted]</p>

Several proposals could lead to  joint endeavors, mainly in civil aeronautics but also in the  military domain...    In the civilian sector, three new joint Europe-Japan  projects  (with or without American participation) are under  consideration. By order of size and feasibility in time, they  are:        -  the YSX regional transport aircraft, with a capacity of  70-80 passengers;    -  the future very large capacity aircraft (600-800 seats);    -  the second-generation SST (successor to the Concorde).       The YSX project is dear to the hearts of the Japanese.  Prefeasibility studies for this aircraft, which would take the  place of the YS11, are being carried out by Japan Aircraft  Development (a subsidiary of Mitsubishi and Kawasaki) with  support from MITI [Ministry of Industry and Trade]. The Japanese  have already held discussions with the Chinese on joint  construction of the aircraft. In September 1993, a delegation  from the Japanese Aeronautical Industries Group (SJAC) visited  China at the invitation of its counterpart, the China National  Aviation Industry Corporation (AVIC). The two entities agreed to  promote exchanges between the two countries, and in particular  to launch discussions on development of this 70-80 seat plane.  The two Asian partners are also looking for one or two western  partners. Possible candidates include Boeing, the Franco-Italian  ATR, and Sweden's Saab.    Boeing's participation would come as a surprise, since the  American airplane builder dropped out of the regional aircraft  market a little more than 2 years ago by selling off its  Canadian subsidiary De Havilland. But Boeing has made Japan  virtually a private preserve. The Japanese builders are closely  involved in Boeing manufactures, particularly in production of  the 767 and the future Boeing 777; the Japanese are junior  partners in production of the latter, supplying a large part of  the fuselage. Plus there is the forthcoming 737-X, which the  Japanese selected after toying with the idea of developing their  own 150-seat aircraft. If Boeing is ready to "get aboard" the  YSX, it is probably just to keep an eye on what Japanese  builders are planning with other firms. All the same, the  Americans are taking it very seriously. Dean Thorton, president  of Boeing Commercial Airline Group (BCAG), traveled to Japan in  October 1993. He reaffirmed his company's interest in the YSX  project and according to our information actually entered into  negotiations with Japan about the program. Since January, the  negotiations begun by Thorton have been pursued by Ronald  Woodard, his successor as head of BCAG.    Finally, it was learned a few days ago in the Japanese press  that European builders ATR and Saab might participate in the  program. These two partners would lend technical credibility and  an extraordinary marketing base to this program, leaving  Germany's DASA [Deutsche Aerospace] and its Fokker subsidiary  out in the cold. Sources at Aerospatiale and ATR confirm the  discussions now under way, noting that other partnerships are  also under consideration and the question has not yet been  decided.    The two other civilian programs that might give rise to  joint  ventures with Japan are less far advanced. The giant 600-800  seat aircraft is the subject of discussions between European and  American firms, which are going to meet in March to decide  whether to pursue feasibility studies. If the project gets a  go-ahead, it is clear the Japanese manufacturers will be  participating. For two reasons: The first is that they are ready  to contribute substantially to the financing--and lots of money  will be needed. According to latest available figures, it would  cost 90 to 120 billion French francs [Fr] to develop a  super-jumbo aircraft!    The second argument for Japanese participation is the fact  that Japanese airlines comprise most of the estimated 500-plane  market for jumbo carriers. It is difficult to imagine Japan  Airlines or ANA opting for such an aircraft if their country  were excluded from its manufacture. It is always possible,  however, that European and American builders will decide not to  work together. In that event, they would be fighting to cut a  deal with their Japanese partner. About a year ago, Airbus  Industrie made some overtures along those lines to Japan. Boeing  did not appreciate it.    There remains a third domain of possible cooperation between  western firms and the Japanese: the second-generation supersonic  transport. The Japanese are very excited about the Concorde's  successor, especially the technological potential of such a  program. Kawasaki, Mitsubishi, and Fuji have joined the  American-European study group working on the feasibility study.  This SST would carry 250-300 passengers and have a range of  10,000 to 12,000 km traveling at twice the speed of sound. It  would thus go twice as far as the Concorde and carry twice as  many passengers. But no one knows whether the fare would be half  as expensive. According to Boeing, for success to be assured,  the average fare (all seating classes combined) for a supersonic  flight could not be more than 20 percent over the average  subsonic fare. In this domain, the Europeans have the advantage  of all their technological experience with the Concorde, while  the Japanese have the financial resources and desire to work in  the most advanced technologies, and the Americans have a fierce  determination not to let Europe continue enjoying a monopoly in  this field!    Besides the benefits presented by cooperation in civil  aeronautics, Japan also has enormous potential in the military  domain. Little by little, Japanese military defense spending has  steadily grown. It has now even outstripped France's [military]  budget, one of the largest in the world. With the recession,  Japan has slowed down the growth in its defense spending, which  is virtually pegged to Gross Domestic Product). The military  budget each year is equal to about 1 percent of GDP.    For fiscal 1994, the Defense Agency's budget is equal to  about Fr250 billion (4,730 billion yen), up 1.95 percent over  1993. The Navy fares best (up 3.5 percent) in the current  budget, since Army spending has increased only 2.9 percent and  the Air Force is suffering a 2.8 percent cutback.    Japan's commitment to self-reliance in arms manufacturing  presents certain opportunities to European and French  industries. That explains the initiative of 20 French  enterprises that sent a mission of 30 engineers to Tokyo late  last year as part of a delegation led by GIFAS [French  Aeronautics and Space Industries Group]. The purpose: to  introduce the most advanced French technologies and persuade the  Japanese to quit thinking of the United States as their only  possible industrial partner.    In the field of helicopters, for example, Japan will soon be  facing two important decisions. The first concerns a medium-size  transport helicopter eventually to be equipped with rocket  launchers. Eurocopter is offering the Cougar, to be built in  partnership with Kawasaki, which if the deal goes through would  build it in the archipelago under license. The competition is  Sikorski, which in partnership with Mitsubishi is offering the  Black Hawk. A decision is expected in March 1994. The order  could be for as many as 40 of the craft.  <H5>  Helicopter Market </H5>   The other major decision concerns the OHX observation  helicopter, 100 of which are to be built. This would be a  helicopter designed and manufactured entirely in Japan, with  Kawasaki as prime contractor and engines provided by Mitsubishi.  Many French outfitters are competing to equip the Japanese  craft. Sextant Avionics, in partnership with a Japanese  licensee, would be among the best placed to succeed.    In general, French industry is following closely the efforts  of Japanese industry to break free of reliance on the Americans.  The latter are chary--and we would be no less cautious--about  turning over their technology, and they intend to continue  keeping a close eye on new Japanese developments. This is the  case too in the domain of warplanes. In the FSX program, the  airframe is being built in partnership with Lockheed and the  engines in partnership with General Electric. GE has agreed to  let Ishikawajima Harima (IHI) manufacture the F110 GE engine  under license, but the US Government and Congress have refused  to lift restrictions on some technologies incorporated into the  engine. Mitsubishi has completed fabrication of the first left  wing built entirely of composites. Lockheed is building the  right wing. Japan is also working on countermeasures for the  FSX. Besides its own electronic defense system, the Japanese  craft will benefit from protection provided by a specialized  aircraft. This is the F-15 J, which would carry an  ultra-powerful countermeasures system (using active-antenna  radar) in a nacelle housing.    Overall, Japan's technological needs will continue growing.  Anxious about the nuclear threat posed by North Korea and the  increasing power of China, Japan cannot afford to lower its  guard. Numerous psychological and juridical obstacles must still  be overcome before Japan plays a more active role in the Asian  region. Indeed, as recently as last December Keisuke Nakanishi,  director general of the Japanese Defense Agency (and  quasi-defense minister), was forced to step down because he was  a little too quick in calling for revision of the 50-year-old  law that determines Japan's defense posture. He wanted Japan to  be able to respond pragmatically to the demands of the post-Cold  War period. But in the meantime there's nothing to stop Japan  from developing areas of excellence in defense electronics and  space technology. So its advances and innovations will need to  be followed attentively.  <H5>  French Technologies of Interest to Japan </H5>   Helicopters:     -  vision systems for helicopters (SFIM  Industries);    -  Automatic pilots for helicopters (SFIM Industries);    -  Battlefield surveillance by heliborne Horizon radar  (Eurocopter, Thomson/LCTAR, Dassault Electronics);    -  VTOL air-to-air surveillance system (Dassault Electronics);    -  Saphir passive countermeasures system (Matra Defense).

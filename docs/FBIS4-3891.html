			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Cary Huang, China editor] </F>   [Text] The Reformist camp within China's ruling Communist  Party is to launch sweeping celebrations to mark paramount  leader Deng Xiaoping's 90th birthday in a bid to further advance  their capitalistic economic reforms. The August celebrations  are also designed by reformist officials to boost their position  in internal fighting in the post-Deng era, following fears for  the health of the reclusive leader.    The moves to promote the patriarch's status in party and  Chinese history are additionally aimed at offsetting the  increasing influences of the late Chairman Mao. A high-profile  team led by Politburo member and propaganda chief Ding Guanggen,  who is also Mr Deng's bridge partner, was recently set up to  co-ordinate a series of birthday activities, according to  Chinese sources. For the first time, official ceremonies on Mr  Deng's birthday will be held during the day. And autographed  albums and other souvenirs of the senior leader will be issued  in the coming months.    Meanwhile, the largest documentary ever made on Mr Deng is  being shot by Central Newsreels and Documentary Film Studios  under the supervision of Mr Ding and the propaganda department  of the party's central committee. Mr Ding, in an internal  speech, said the party central committee will provide enough  cash to fund the shooting of documentaries for Mr Deng and Peng  Zhen, another senior retired leader, despite attempts by many  party elders to get cash for their own documentaries.    Beijing sources said the liberal wing within the leadership  has been preparing for the Campaign to offset the late Chairman  Mao's influence in China's politics. Some reformist officials  thought Mr Deng's paramount authority was abating following last  year's Mao frenzy, organised by leftists to mark the centenary  of the birthday of the great helmsman.    Reformists wanted to capitalise on Mr Deng's 90th birthday  in  August in the same way. "They thought Deng Xiaoping's 90th  birthday is the last good and important occasion for them to  campaign for liberal ideas in China," one source said.</p>

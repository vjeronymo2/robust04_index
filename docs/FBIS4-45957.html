			<p>BFN     [Text] Lahore -- Pakistan's atomic scientist Dr Abdul  Qadeer Khan has said that Pakistan has rejected unilateral  pressure on its nuclear programme. Through argumentation, it  has got the pressure released to some extent and now some  pressure has been diverted to India too which was not the case  before.    Talking to THE NATION and NAWA-I-WAQT on Friday, he said by  the grace of God "we are fully capable of defending the country  and military-wise our country is in strong hands. In this  connection, no one should have any misunderstanding, nor does  anyone need to worry about that."    Commenting, he said the present government has realised the  importance of defence and has provided the required funds. Both  the Prime Minister and the Chief of the Army Staff are fully  aware of the situation. That is why, no cut has been made in  the defence budgetary allocations. He said if need be "we are  ready to ask the nation for donations for country's defence."    Emphasising unity, he said it strengthens the defence. But  the nation is not united to the extent it should be. There are  two methods of getting the defence strengthened: first, to  increase the military capability and, second, by increasing  friends at diplomatic and political levels. "Sometimes you  achieve a goal diplomatically which is difficult militarily or  otherwise." However, he said, one cannot deny the importance of  military might. "This is because you have more friends when you  are powerful and the country which is weak economically and  militarily cannot make many friends."    He said the present political situation demands that "we get  united". National unity is very important he repeated. No  country can endeavour to establish peace single-handedly as this  is the responsibility of all the countries of the region.  Whichever proposals Pakistan has given for peace have been  appreciated by all the countries, Iran, China and even the U.S.  has declared it a positive approach. But India has not liked  these suggestions, he added. "If India does not like our  proposals, it should give its own." India should bring its  proposals at the negotiating table, he said, adding that "we  want permanent peace in the region as much as does someone else."    He said the impression that "we the atomic scientists are  against peace is wrong." Any general or atomic scientist loves  peace as much as others do.    Coming to the Kashmir issue, he said Pakistan wants peaceful  solution to the issue. Pakistan has given some proposals for  establishment of peace in the region and now it is the duty of  India to respond positively.    Answering a question on Kalabagh Dam, he said the  apprehensions and fears which some people have must be addressed  Changes in the designs of the project and other such matters  [word indistinct] introduced with the consent of all the  concerned, but this matter should not be politicised. Those  having objections to the plan should make their objections clear  and those who are responsible to remove these should do that.    He said instead of politicians the debate on this project  should be given to the experts. Besides, no hurdles should be  created in this plan. He said it is generally believed that  this dam should not be built, for it would result in some loss.  Whereas the other opinion is that this plan is very much in the  nation's interest and, accordingly, it should be started at the  earliest.    He said when a big project is started, some people do get  affected. The construction of Tarbela and Mangla Dams also  affected many but it also benefited the entire nation. The  government paid the compensation to the affectees.    He said the power crisis can be overcome by setting up  nuclear power stations. He revealed that fresh round of talks  between Pakistan and France on atomic power plant is about to  commence. France promised to give Pakistan that plant. Later  on, it did not fulfil its promise due to certain reasons, "I  think we have the right to get that plant and I hope  negotiations would start soon which would prove useful."    He said there is no denying the fact that there was much  pressure in the past as regards its peaceful nuclear programme.  But the stance of Pakistan has forced those pressurising  elements to see the reality, Pakistan has always adopted the  stance that it should not be discriminated against as far as the  atomic programme is concerned. Rather both Pakistan and India  should be treated alike.    Further, Pakistan's proposal to declare South Asia  nuclear-free region was appreciated by all with the sole  exception of India. Pakistan has clearly stated that it favours  nuclear proliferation. [sentence as published] But this is  something Pakistan cannot do alone. If this aim is to be  achieved. India too would have to be convinced.    He said Pakistan rejected any unity lateral pressure on it  because of which the supply of F-16s has been suspended although  Pakistan has paid for the aircraft. Even then Pakistan did not  compromise on its national defence. "Had we compromised, the  aircraft would not have been withheld and supply of other  military aid too would have started again. "We think the  present government has got the pressure released through its  logics and now some pressure has been diverted to India."    He said getting any country's atomic programme frozen and  linking it with foreign aid can in no way be declared in line  with the UN Charter or international demands. Every country has  the right to utilise all its resources to ensure its defence.  However, if a formula is chalked out to ensure international  peace, it should be applied to all the countries without any  discrimination.    India increased its defence budget. It is a big country.  What danger does it have? It has no threat from any other  country. It has increased its defence budget only to establish  its regional supremacy. But the old ideas to establish  supremacy have died out as even small states can make their  defence strong against big countries.    He said Benazir Bhutto and COAS [Chief of Army Staff] Gen  Abdul Waheed are fully aware of the situation. That is why, no  cuts have been made in the budgetary allocations for defence.  Had India reduced its defence budget. Pakistan too had an  option.    The attitude of the government, its foreign policy, the  steps  it took as regards Kashmir and the decisions taken by the  political and military leadership are correct. He, however,  said the present steps being taken for the scientific and  technological development are not enough. "We have to do much  more in this connection."    Dr Qadeer observed the energy crisis has not surfaced  overnight. There are many reasons behind them. As such, it  cannot be overcome overnight. Particularly the economic and  energy crises cannot be redressed overnight.    The common man thinks about what the previous governments  have done in this regard. Had some concrete steps been taken at  the very outset, the situation would have been different. Its a  good sign that the present government had initiated some plans  for energy. But energy crisis would take some time.    He said even the Ministers do not want to take the  portfolios  of Science and Technology. "This shows how much interest we  take in this field. Fund collection is no problem." Like other  benefit shows, one can be arranged to better the economic  conditions of the country too, he concluded.</p>

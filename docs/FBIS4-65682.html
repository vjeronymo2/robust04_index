			<p>BFN     [Text] Bielefeld (DPA) -- On Wednesday [18 May] evening,  FRG Finance Minister and Christian Social Union [CSU] Chairman  Theo Waigel vehemently defended the strict austerity course of  the FRG Government. The financial scope for new expenses and  "social charitable acts" are not currently available, the  minister said at a Christian Democratic Union event on the  European election in Bielefeld. Bonn's priority objective must  be a solid financial and tax policy. One must not deviate from  the course of annual savings of 70 billion German marks, he said.    For this year, Waigel predicted an economic growth of 1.5  percent in the old laender and 7 to 10 percent in eastern  Germany. The inflation rate will probably have a two before the  decimal at the end of 1994. "Things are improving again; we  have the problems under control," the minister said.</p>

SAC MEET NEXT  </P> <P> The UCLA men's track team's streak of victories in dual meets was stopped last  week at 42, but the Bruins remain unbeaten in 43 meets dating to the end of the  1984 season.  </P> <P> In a triangular meet with dual scoring last week, the Bruins defeated Houston,  97-57, to tie the school record of 42 straight dual-meet victories, set from  1972 through 1976. But UCLA tied Louisiana State, 77-77, and had to win the  last event, the 1,600-meter relay, to gain the tie. The Bruins won the  triangular with 73 points to 70 for LSU and 49 for Houston.  </P> <P> Michael Marsh and Steve Lewis were held out of individual events because of  hamstring injuries, but both ran legs on the 1,600 relay team as UCLA turned in  a season-best 3:06.2 to win.  </P> <P> Derek Knight also was nursing a hamstring but still won both hurdle events and  set a personal record of 50.54 in the 400 hurdles. Other Bruins who did well  included Christian Cushing-Murray, who won the 1,500-meter run in a  personal-best 3:42.81, and David Wilson, who set meet records in winning the  hammer throw at 218-1 and the shot put at 61-2.  </P> <P> The Bruins (4-0-1 in dual meets this season) will compete Saturday and Sunday  in the 31st annual Mt. San Antonio College Relays. Marsh, Lewis and several  others may be held out to rest injuries.  </P> <P> In a double-dual meet last week, the UCLA women, who will also be in the Mt.  Sac relays, defeated LSU, 85-51, and Houston, 94-43, running their dual-meet  record to 6-0.  </P> <P> Qualifying for the NCAA championships last week were Bruins Kris Larson,  Janeene Vickers and Julie Johnson. Larson had a mark of 175-2 in winning the  discus, Vickers ran a 58-flat 400 hurdles and Johnson did the 800 in 2:05.7.  </P> <P> The Santa Monica College men's and women's track teams will compete today in  the Mt.

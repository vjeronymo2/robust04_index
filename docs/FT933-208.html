			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / MMC to examine allocation of films THE DISTRIBUTION of films to cinemas has been referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission by Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading. Sir Bryan said yesterday the Office of Fair Trading had decided to investigate the industry after independent cinemas complained it was difficult to obtain popular films from large distributors. Independent cinema owners welcomed the inquiry, but large companies called it unnecessary, saying the increase in multi-screen complexes and a sharp rise in attendances meant consumers now had a wide choice of films. Sir Bryan said the independent cinemas' difficulties had continued despite changes which followed an MMC report in 1983. The report resulted in the prohibition of 'barring', under which distributors decide in advance which cinemas have the right to show films first. Sir Bryan said: 'Most major companies are vertically integrated into the production, distribution and exhibition of films in cinemas and follow practices which could lead to the exclusion of independent producers, distributors and exhibitors from the marketplace. 'I am aware of the changes that have taken place, such as the emergence of multiplex cinemas, but I consider that competition remains restricted to such an extent that it is appropriate for the MMC to undertake a fresh investigation.' Mr James Higgins, president of the Society of Film Distributors, said he was confident the commission would find that distributors and cinemas were providing consumers with greater choice than ever before. He said Pounds 500m had been invested in new cinemas over the past 10 years, a larger amount than in any other country. Cinema admissions had increased from 52m in 1984 to over 100m last year. Mr Higgins said films were being distributed far more widely than at the time of the last report. He said that a decade ago, 220 copies of ET had been distributed to UK cinemas, which was then a record. He said 450 copies of Jurassic Park, this year's blockbuster, had been distributed. Mr Tony Kirkhope, managing director of the independent two-screen Metro Cinema in central London, said he had difficulty obtaining US pictures. 'They don't offer them to us - only the dogs.' He said the large distributors had 'made it amply clear they weren't going to deal with the independents in the West End'. Mr Geoffrey Henshaw, owner of the three-screen Cine City cinema in Manchester, said small operators found large distributors' terms onerous. Mr Henshaw said distributors insisted that cinemas show their films for three weeks, regardless of how well or badly they were doing.  ----------------------------------- NOT COMING SOON TO AN INDEPENDENT CINEMA NEAR YOU  ----------------------------------- In the Line of Fire Sleepless in Seattle Cliffhanger Jurassic Park Bram Stoker's Dracula Last Action Hero The Fugitive Rising Sun Hot Shots Part Deux Indecent Proposal  -----------------------------------</p>

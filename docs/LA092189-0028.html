			<p><P> September 21, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: NOISE LAW WON'T BE REVIEWED  </P> <P> The Redondo Beach City Council voted 3 to 2 Tuesday not to review the city's  noise ordinance and to postpone considering a change in the ordinance proposed  by Southern California Edison Co., whose power plant in the city has generated  complaints about noise.  </P> <P> Before the vote, Mayor Brad Parton threatened to veto any decision by the  council to reconsider the ordinance before the city finishes studying it.  </P> <P> The council last reviewed the ordinance in August, when it voted unanimously to  wait at least six months before giving further consideration to an Edison  proposal to establish a noise limit of 64 decibels, measured at the power  plant's borders. The change was proposed by company officials after months of  negotiation with City Atty. Gordon Phillips.  </P> <P> Under the present ordinance, noise levels are measured at a complaining  resident's home. Legal limits are 50 decibels during the day and 45 at night.  </P> <P> Residents have complained that noise from generators, fans and other Edison  equipment disturbs their sleep and daytime activities.  </P> <P> City Manager Tim Casey said the city attorney and a noise consultant will  continue studying how noise is measured under the present ordinance. Their  report will be completed in about three months, he said.  </P></p>

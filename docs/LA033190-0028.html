			<p><P> March 31, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PSYCHIATRIC EVALUATION ORDERED FOR DOG KILLER  </P> <P> A letter carrier who shot and killed a dog while delivering mail on his Arleta  route last December was ordered Friday to undergo a psychiatric evaluation  before being sentenced for the shooting.  </P> <P> San Fernando Superior Court Judge Meredith C. Taylor delayed sentencing for  Floyd Bertran Sterling to April 26.  </P> <P> Sterling, 35, of Pacoima, pleaded no contest Feb. 21 to one count of felony  cruelty to animals. In exchange, prosecutors agreed to drop charges of carrying  a concealed weapon and using a firearm in a grossly negligent manner.  </P> <P> Sterling shot and killed Skippy, a mixed-breed German shepherd, just as the  dog's owner emerged from her house to give the postman a bottle of vodka for  Christmas.  </P> <P> Taylor said the psychiatric report would help her decide whether to follow a  probation officer's "exceptionally favorable" sentencing recommendation. The  report recommended that Sterling receive jail time followed by probation.  </P> <P> Taylor said she was concerned by an earlier violent incident involving  Sterling, an apparent reference to Sterling's 1982 conviction for misdemeanor  spousal abuse. Deputy Dist. Atty. David R. Lopez said he wants Sterling  sentenced to the maximum of one year in jail and three years' felony probation.  Sterling could be fined a maximum of $20,000.  </P></p>

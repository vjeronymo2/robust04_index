			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / Management (The Growing Business): DTI consolidates enterprise funding - In A Nutshell The Department of Trade and Industry will no longer provide financial backing to help companies implement recommendations from consultants employed under the Enterprise Initiative. The aim is to save the Pounds 3m-Pounds 4m annual cost of implementation guidance and devote it to subsidising the enterprise initiative proper. The enterprise initiative provides half of the cost - two-thirds in some parts of the country - of up to 15 days of consultants' advice in areas such as marketing, quality and financial management. Implementation guidance consists of a discretionary extra five days of subsidy.</p>

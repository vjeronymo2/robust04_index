			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 3 KYODO -- Foreign Minister Koji  Kakizawa pledged Japanese cooperation Friday [3 June] if the  United Nations decides to impose sanctions on North Korea for  the country's continued refusal to allow international  inspections at its nuclear facilities.    "Should United Nations measures be decided, it is desirable  that Japan cooperate in these," Kakizawa said in answering a  question from a Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) legislator in the  House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee. In case the  UN Security Council cannot reach agreement over the sanctions  issue due to anticipated opposition from China, North Korea's  traditional ally which favors a soft approach in the nuclear  controversy, Japan would offer "maximum cooperation" in  multilateral punitive measures, he said. Japan could do its  part by halting cash remittances to North Korea from  pro-Pyongyang organizations and residents in Japan and  suspending trade with the communist country, Kakizawa said.    Taking into account that the situation on the Korean  peninsula is Japan's direct security interest, Tokyo's "basic  foreign policy stance" is to do its utmost to support Washington  should it decide to move independently from the UN, he said. He  said, however, such U.S. measures would have to be "effective"  to gain Tokyo's approval. Kakizawa also stressed that without  winning China's support the UN Security council would not be  able to exert any pressure on North Korea to accept the  international calls for inspections.    In response to another question from the opposition LDP,  Kakizawa said Japan would resume normalization talks with North  Korea as soon as possible if Pyongyang "displays a sincere  attitude toward dispelling suspicions that it is developing  nuclear weapons." Asked for an assessment of U.S. moves toward  sanctions, Yutaka Kawashima, director general of the Foreign  Ministry's Asia Affairs Bureau, said "there are various  opinions" within U.S. President Bill Clinton's administration  and no unified stance has been formulated yet. "There are calls  for sanctions as anger has built up after one year of endurance"  in the nuclear controversy, he said, adding "the American  Government's stance has not hardened yet."    Following a regular cabinet meeting in the morning, chief  Government Spokesman Hiroshi Kumagai reiterated Tokyo's concern  over North Korea's defiance of the inspection demands. "We are  deeply concerned about this situation," Kumagai told a news  conference. "We would like to weigh what action to take in close  concert with the countries involved such as the United States,  South Korea and China," he said.    Kumagai later said before a lower house panel, "we have no  specific sanctions in mind. We will tenaciously try to  persuade" North Korea to reach a negotiated settlement of the  nuclear row.    On Thursday, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)  informed the UN Security Council that Pyongyang's refusal to let  inspectors conduct an unimpeded check of discharged fuel rods  has made it impossible to verify whether plutonium has been  diverted in the past to manufacture atomic bombs. North Korea  last month started to exchange without IAEA supervision the  8,000 fuel rods in its 5-megawatt reactor at Yongbyon, sparking  another security council statement last week urging compliance  with the agency's inspection demands.</p>

			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / Babycham at home with Old England Babycham, Olde English Cider and Concorde British wine, three of Britain's best-known drinks brands, were yesterday sold as part of the takeover of Gaymer Group Europe by Matthew Clark. The move will give Clark, which boasts Warninks advocaat and Stones Ginger Wine among its own brands, nearly 90 per cent of the domestically produced fortified wine market through the merger of its Old England products and Gaymer's QC range. Including Gaymer's debts, which will be repaid, the deal is worth Pounds 109m. The deal is to be funded through a rights issue, Clark's third in 18 months, in a move which will more than double its share base to 45.8m shares. The three-for-five issue at 500p a share will raise Pounds 64.4m, most of which will be used to repay Gaymer's Pounds 53.5m of debt. Clark shares yesterday closed down 36p at 589p. The Pounds 55.6m balance of the purchase price will be paid through the issue of Clark shares to venture capital investors, who hold about 94 per cent of Gaymer. Gaymer made pre-tax profits of Pounds 8.1m in the year to February 28 against Pounds 8.6m the previous year. Turnover rose from Pounds 135.7m to Pounds 143.3m. For the year to July 31, Clark made profits of Pounds 10.3m on turnover of Pounds 174m. Gaymer, which was subject to a Pounds 105m management buy-out two years ago, had been expected to float on the stock market later this year, and yesterday's move took industry analysts by surprise. Sources among the venture capitalists said the decision was taken against the background of a price war in the cider market which had contributed to a slowdown in earnings at Gaymer. There were also concerns over the company's management: the chief executive stepped aside earlier this year and two other directors left. Another trade offer was made, rumoured to be from Taunton Cider. Clark said it believed there would be no referral to the Office of Fair Trading. Mr Michael Cotterill, chairman of both Taunton and Matthew Clark, yesterday resigned from his post at Taunton, citing a conflict of interest given Gaymer's cider operations. Both Mr Cotterill and the company yesterday refused further comment.</p>

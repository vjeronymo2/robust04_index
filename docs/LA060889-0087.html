			<p><P> June 8, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST: LONG BEACH;  </P> <P> CARNAVAL STREET FESTIVAL MAKES PROFIT OF $11,740  </P> <P> Proclaiming it a resounding success, the sponsors of Carnaval II say that the  Caribbean-flavored festival in downtown Long Beach attracted up to 60,000  revelers and wound up with a net profit of $11,740.  </P> <P> The event marked a major improvement from its debut last year when Carnaval  attracted large crowds but racked up a $67,352 deficit because of poor liquor  sales and unplanned expenses.  </P> <P> Bill Gurzi, president of the Downtown Long Beach Associates business group that  staged the event, said the parade and music festival would have drawn even more  had it not occurred on Saturday during the three-day Memorial Day weekend.  </P> <P> Al Williams, owner of the Birdland West jazz club and Carnaval II chairman,  said the event brought together a wide range of society, "the rich people and  the poor people," to watch costumed parade participants, sample ethnic foods  and listen to a variety of bands.  </P> <P> He said there were 10 arrests, all for drunk and disorderly conduct.  </P> <P> Part of this year's financial success was due to the sale of wristbands for $2  each for admission to all music venues, increased beer sales and tougher  financial controls, financial officer Bob Sabol said.  </P></p>

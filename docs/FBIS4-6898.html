			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>   [Text] A further reflection of the going cooperation  between and among countries of ASEAN was seen in Kuala Lumpur  two days ago, where Malaysia and Thailand signed an agreement to  jointly explore and exploit oil and gas resources in the Gulf of  Thailand. The signing has paved the way for the launching of  the oil exploration in the more than 7,000 square kilometer area  known as the Joint Development Area, JDA. It took 14 years of  talks and negotiations. But the fact that they have led to a  successful conclusion is a positive sign of the majority of the  leaderships of the two countries and their senior officials who  have been engaged in the talks.    Studies made in the JDA have shown that it can be a source  as  well as a reservoir of oil and gas. Several oil discoveries  have already been made in the area. The joint exploration will  no doubt lead to more discoveries that will be of benefit to  both countries. Four agreements have been signed, including two  for production sharing and the other two for joint operations.  It may be remembered that both Malaysia and Thailand had  previously laid claims to the area in question. So the presence  of the prime ministers of the two countries, Dr. Mahathir  Mohamed and Mr. Chuan Likphai, at the signing ceremony gave  added significance to the new venture that the two ASEAN nations  have jointly agreed to embark upon.    Dr. Mahathir has described the approach to the agreements as  a model for the settlement of overlapping claims. With the  signing of the agreements, both countries can look towards  broadening cooperation in many other fields that will bring  benefit to the people as well as contribute towards a peaceful,  prosperous, and stable Southeast Asia.    On his part, Mr. Chuan has expressed confidence that the  agreements will boost the close cooperation between the two  countries. The agreements, in his words, are a testimony to a  long and fruitful relationship between his country and Malaysia.    The body that is chiefly responsible for bringing about the  joint exploration deals is the Malaysia-Thailand Joint  Authority, MTJA. It ought to be congratulated for its award of  contracts to three big companies -- one from Malaysia and the  other two from Thailand -- to carry out the operations. The  MTJA emerged from the foresight of past leaders, namely, the  late premier of Malaysia, Tun Hussein Onn and his then Thai  counterpart, General Kriangsak Chamanan. Their intention to  resolve the problem of overlapping claims in the Gulf of  Thailand came out with a novel idea of establishing a joint  authority.    To the MTJA, there is great scope for the two countries to  develop and intensify their economic cooperation. The joint  exploration for oil and gas is a unique venture. The MTJA and  the three contracting parties have a big task ahead to bring  about fruitful results for the benefit of both Malaysia and  Thailand.</p>

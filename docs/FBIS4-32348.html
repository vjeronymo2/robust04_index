			<p>BFN     [Text] New York, June 22 (CTK) -- "It cannot be ruled out  that ex-Premier Vladimir Meciar's Movement for a Democratic  Slovakia will be the strongest party after the September  parliamentary elections but it will not be able to form a  government," Slovak President Michal Kovac said today.    He said forming a new government would evidently be a task  for a coalition which would probably be made of the political  parties constituting the current government.    At a joint news conference with Hungarian President Arpad  Goncz here Kovac reiterated his support for the improved  relations between Slovakia and Hungary which he said were not  yet really good and neighborly. Kovac said that now, after the  Hungarian parliamentary elections, new conditions are being  created for general progress, including the progress in solving  a dispute concerning the Gabcikovo hydroelectric project on the  Danube.    Goncz confirmed that in this case technical questions are at  issue but also political and national minority problems. He  pointed out that Slovakia had not complied with recent  recommendations by the European Union concerning the Gabcikovo  dam.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mirza Sadikovic] </F>   [Text] The Serbian aggressor this morning resumed  artillery-infantry attacks on the Bihac region. Defenders at  (Vlasko), Hasino Brdo, and Grmusko-Srbljanski Heights have been  submitted to unprecedented howitzer and tank fire, which has  killed a large number of them. Although they have been  suffering constant losses in manpower and military hardware, the  chetniks are still mindlessly attacking. Heroes of the 5th  Corps have destroyed one enemy antiaircraft gun, two ZIS  weapons, and several motor vehicles, which obviously serves the  chetniks with a reason to continue and increase their wild  artillery activity on Bihac, Cazin, and their outskirts. There  are dozens of injured civilians due to the systematic  destruction of settlements over the last 24 hours. Local  hospitals are full, and there are hardly any basic first aid  kits. Chetnik helicopters are still freely flying over the  Bihac area bringing in new manpower and new artillery. The  world is still calmly observing this [word indistinct] and  disappearance of people and tows from the face of the earth.</p>

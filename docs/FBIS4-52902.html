			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 14 (YONHAP) -- There will be no next  North Korea-U.S. high-level dialogue if Pyongyang is found to  have crossed "the line" in unloading from its nuclear reactor, a  high-level Foreign Ministry official said Saturday.    This "line" is crossed if North Korea conducted any activity  with the nuclear fuel rods that makes it impossible for the  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to randomly select and  secure them for measurements later, this official said on  condition of anonymity.    He suggested, however, that the immediate worry over North  Korea's nuclear program is separate from this rod unloading  process.    "We have to remember that the most important thing right now  is preventing North Korea from taking the rods out, using them  for reprocessing to make materials that can be used for making  weapons," he said. But the point in securing and measuring the  rods is in tracing back the history and thus is separate from  preventing nuclear weapons program, he said.    Pyongyang notified the International Atomic Energy Agency  (IAEA) Friday that it began the rod discharging process, no  longer able to defer it for technical reasons.    Seoul, Washington, and the IAEA had repeatedly said  unloading  of the rods without monitoring by the agency means an end to  dialogue on the nuclear row.    The official was optimistic that Pyongyang hasn't yet  crossed  the line since it has told the IAEA there is still an  opportunity for the agency to select and secure the rods.    "If North Korea had already passed the line, this would be  impossible," said the official. If the line has been crossed,  there will be no next round of North Korea-U.S. high-level  dialogue, this official emphasized.    There will be no high-level dialogue while the IAEA  inspection team is in Pyongyang next week, despite North Korea's  demand that the they discuss the rod unloading agenda at the  high-level meeting, he said.</p>

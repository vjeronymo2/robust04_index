			<p>920822 FT  22 AUG 92 / SA government in talks with ANC THE South African government and the African National Congress (ANC) met yesterday at a secret venue to try to revive talks on a multiracial constitution. The talks involved Mr Cyril Ramaphosa, ANC secretary-general, and Mr Roelf Meyer, constitutional development minister. Both sides would give no details, but it seemed likely they would focus on issues such as the release of political prisoners and the possibility of a general amnesty for those involved in political violence - including the South African security forces. Resolution of these issues is a precondition for the resumption of talks on a new constitution, suspended two months ago in the wake of a massacre at the Boipatong squatter camp near Johannesburg. Over the past week, political groups from the extreme right and left have said they might be willing to participate in talks. The ultra-radical Pan Africanist Congress (PAC) met government officials this week to discuss participation, and a breakaway group of right-wing MPs said it will join the talks to negotiate for a white homeland for the Afrikaner people.</p>

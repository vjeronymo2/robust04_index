			<p><P> March 29, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 400-TON BRIDGE BEING CONSTRUCTED FOR RAIL LINE FALLS;  </P> <P> PEDESTRIAN HIT BY DEBRIS AND 2 IN TRUCK CRUSHED BY SPAN ESCAPE DEATH  </P> <P> A 400-ton steel-and-concrete bridge being built to support the Los Angeles-Long  Beach light rail commuter line collapsed onto Firestone Boulevard on Tuesday  morning, injuring two men in a pickup truck that was crushed by the debris and  nicking a pedestrian who was hit by falling lumber.  </P> <P> The cause of the collapse at 9:10 a.m. was under investigation.  </P> <P> Early speculation focused on the possible failure of a timber-and-steel  structure designed to support the span as construction proceeded in an  unincorporated area of South Los Angeles.  </P> <P> An engineer working for Los Angeles County transit officials had voiced  concerns about the adequacy of the structure on Firestone, near Graham Avenue,  in an internal memo filed nine months ago.  </P> <P> Rescue workers and officials likened the damage to the aftermath of an  earthquake, with the south end of the structure dropping in lean-to fashion.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Bottles Toppled  </P> <P> A woman who lives a block away said she, in fact, thought a temblor had hit,  after the shaking knocked perfume bottles off her dresser.  </P> <P> A sheriff's deputy who witnessed the collapse said he initially presumed the  two men in the pickup truck were killed.  </P> <P> Amazingly, Marcos Pacheco Ramirez and Alejandro Hernandez, who were en route to  a gardening job, survived "by inches" when falling steel girders crushed the  cab around them, rescue workers said. Pinned in the vehicle for about 45  minutes, they were freed when county Fire Department personnel cut though the  roof of the cab and pried it open with the Jaws of Life.  </P> <P> They were taken to Martin Luther King Jr./Drew Medical Center for relatively  minor injuries, authorities said.  </P> <P> The pedestrian, James Wilson, walked away from the accident after he was struck  in the leg by a piece of lumber. He was examined at the King hospital emergency  room and released.  </P> <P> Three construction workers on the bridge "rode it down when it fell," but were  apparently unhurt, said Ann Reeves, a spokeswoman with the county  Transportation Commission, the agency responsible for the $720-million project.  </P> <P> Reeves said insurance is expected to cover the loss. An official damage figure  was not available, but the bridge is part of a contract totaling $9 million,  officials said.  </P> <P> It was unclear, Reeves said, whether the incident will affect the July, 1990,  target operating date.  </P> <P> Reeves said it was "lucky" the collapse had not occurred minutes earlier, when  Firestone was thick with morning rush-hour traffic.  </P> <P> County Supervisor Kenneth Hahn echoed the same sentiments as he called for a  review of similar projects.  </P> <P> "Could you imagine what would have happened if this was a school bus under  there? It would have a been a major tragedy," Hahn said as he visited the  accident scene, which is in his district.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Investigation Sought  </P> <P> Hahn called for county engineers to conduct a probe of all bridge and road  construction sites in unincorporated areas of the county. The inspection would  pay particular attention to the light-rail project, the supervisor said.  </P> <P> The contractor on the bridge is Morrison-Knudsen Corp., an Idaho-based  construction firm with local offices in Irvine. When completed, the span will  carry four tracks -- both northbound and southbound light-rail lines, as well  as two Southern Pacific freight lines.  </P> <P> Morrison-Knudsen has more than $100 million worth of contracts on the project,  more than any other contractor, including six of the project's seven bridge  structures.  </P> <P> Even with major firms like Morrison-Knudsen, "sometimes the work can be  sloppy," Hahn said.  </P> <P> A spokesman for Morrison-Knudsen declined comment Tuesday, referring questions  to the Transportation Commission.  </P> <P> County officials said that they suspect the collapse occurred either because  the temporary timber support structure failed or because there was a problem  with the footing it was resting on.  </P> <P> According to public records, concerns about the quality of construction on the  Firestone bridge, including possible soil settlement problems under proposed  temporary timber supports, were expressed last June by a project design  engineer.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Internal Memo  </P> <P> It was not clear Tuesday how the problems were addressed. But the engineer,  Steve Tayanipour, warned in an internal memo that a "poorly completed," more  costly project could result if the problems were not addressed. He also  complained that the issues he had raised in meetings on the project were not  being reflected in the official minutes.  </P> <P> Tayanipour could not be reached for comment Tuesday, and his supervisors  referred inquiries to Transportation Commission officials.  </P> <P> John Adams, the commission's manager of rail construction, acknowledged that  Tayanipour had expressed concerns about the ability of the soil to support the  timber structure. He said the commission investigation will include a review of  how the engineer's concerns were resolved.  </P> <P> Adams said he believes this to be an isolated incident. He pointed out that the  project's safety record is above the industry's average.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Heard a Rumble'  </P> <P> When the bridge gave way Tuesday, Sheriff's Deputy Gregory Nelson and three  fellow deputies were in the parking lot of a mini-mall a block away. The  officers were writing reports when they "heard a rumble" and watched the south  end of bridge give way, snapping timbers and pulverizing the concrete traffic  barriers beneath it.  </P> <P> The pickup truck was moving west -- under the north end of the bridge --  meaning it escaped the full force of the collapse. But even after deputies  worked through the debris to the truck, Nelson said, they assumed at least  Ramirez, the owner and driver, was dead.  </P> <P> Several minutes passed before someone managed to reach inside the cab and feel  Ramirez's pulse, Nelson said.  </P> <P> "I was desperate. I thought I'd stay forever," said Hernandez, 19, still  visibly shaken after he was treated at the hospital for injuries to his right  arm and right foot and released.  </P> <P> Hernandez said, "I felt blessed" when he realized he would live.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Knocked Out  </P> <P> Ramirez, 30, is Hernandez's uncle. Relatives who spoke with Ramirez, the father  of seven children, said he apparently was knocked unconscious by the impact and  was in shock.  </P> <P> Doctors decided to keep Ramirez in the hospital overnight for observation of  possible internal injuries. The steering wheel, relatives said, had been jammed  against his abdomen.  </P> <P> Early thoughts of salvaging the structure were abandoned. Cleanup of the  wreckage, which blocked Firestone all day, began Tuesday night. A demolition  crew planned to break up the concrete structure into smaller chunks and remove  them with a crane. The process was expected to take up to three days.  </P> <P> Commission officials offered motel accommodations to area residents bothered by  the noise level of the cleanup.  </P> <P> Times staff writers Penelope McMillan, Henry Weinstein and Michael J. Ybarra  contributed to this article.  </P></p>

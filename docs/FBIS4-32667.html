			<p>BFN     [Text] Skopje, 29 June (TANJUG) -- At a news conference in  Skopje, the Party of Democratic Action [SDA] in Macedonia [The  Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM], headed by  Avdija Pepic, has distributed copies of a letter sent by the  Foreign Ministry of the Muslim government in Sarajevo to the  Macedonian parliament. The letter insists that a new category  be introduced in the Macedonian population census  questionnaires: "Nationality -- Bosniak."    In an explanation, the Bosnian Foreign Ministry says that  this is in accordance with Article 7 of the Muslim  constitutional law, and insists on a representative of the  Sarajevo Muslim government -- the Bosniak-Croat Federation --  taking part in the census.    In the period preceding the census, the SDA itself demanded  the introduction of Bosniaks as a new name for the Muslims of  Macedonia, in accordance with a decision by a symposium held in  the Muslim part of Sarajevo this spring.    According to observers in Skopje, this demand, if fulfilled,  would cause a lot of confusion among the Islamic population in  Macedonia. This is because, in addition to a certain number of  Muslims of Bosnian origin, there is also in Macedonia a certain  number of Serb-speaking Muslims who came from Serbia,  Montenegro, and Herzegovina, as well as about 100,000  Macedonian-speaking Muslims. According to Macedonian analysts,  the introduction of the term Bosniak for all Muslims in the  territory of former Yugoslavia represents yet another  fundamentalist invention of Alija Izetbegovic and his Islamist  aides working on the homogenization of the entire Muslim  population in the territory of former Yugoslavia.</p>

			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Kenya shilling boosts James Finlay Strength of the Kenya shilling lay behind a 30 per cent rise in pre-tax profits at James Finlay, the overseas trading and financial services group, in the first half of 1994. Profits rose to Pounds 4.94m (Pounds 3.8m) after an exchange gain this time of Pounds 646,000, against losses last of Pounds 1.32m. Turnover advanced to Pounds 82m (Pounds 76.3m). Mr Richard Capper, deputy chairman, expected the Kenyan tea crop to be about 20m kg, some 2m kg down on the previous first half. This led to operating profits from plantations (excluding Bangladesh, where the tea is not picked until late in the first half) falling to Pounds 2.46m (Pounds 2.57m). Lower tea trading was offset by reduced losses at Finlay Industries in the US, which makes tractors and lawn mowers and the trading, manufacturing and merchanting division saw lower profits of Pounds 1.21m (Pounds 1.55m). A bright spot was the confectionery and beverage manufacturing side, where profits advanced to Pounds 1.77m (Pounds 1.12m) on the back of greater volumes at Paynes and a lower interest bill. Losses on the oil and gas side fell to Pounds 157,000 (Pounds 418,000) and the group took a provision of Pounds 2.9m against the discontinuance of these operations by the end of the year. Mr Capper said it was 'such a small part of the Finlay empire' and had not been a very good investment. The provision was offset by a profit of Pounds 3.2m from the disposal of the 18 per cent stake in Rockall Scotia Resources. Mr Capper said that the 31 per cent tax charge was likely to rise between 40 and 45 per cent for the year, against 71 per cent last time. Earnings increased to 3.3p (1p) per share and the interim dividend is held at 2p.</p>

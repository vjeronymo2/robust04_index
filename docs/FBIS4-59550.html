			<p>BFN     [Text] Doha, May 16 (AFP)--Northern forces loyal to  President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih aim to blockade the southern  bastion of Aden but not capture it, Yemeni Foreign Minister  Muhammad Basindwah said Monday.    "The priority is not to capture Aden but to put it under  blockade, by controlling its entries and surrounding heights,"  Basindwah, a northerner loyal to the president, told the Qatari  newspaper AL-SHARQ.    The northern army would not try to capture Aden, a  stronghold  of Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid, to "save human lives and  vital economic facilities" in the southern port city.    "Toppling the separatist clique within the Yemeni Socialist  Party" of al-Bid "is the responsibility of the people, the  leaders and the unionist militants of the YSP and their armed  forces," Basindwah said.    His comments came as Salih's forces, fighting an all-out war  against al-Bid's since May 5, were reported Sunday to be  advancing on Aden.    Basindwah repeated that al-Bid and his followers should be  brought to court "for plotting against the unity" of Yemen.    North and South Yemen merged into a single state four years  ago.    He reiterated the north's rejection of an Arab military  intervention to stop the fighting, saying this would mean a  "recognition of an entity led by the rebels."</p>

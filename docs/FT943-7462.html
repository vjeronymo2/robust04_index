			<p>940823 FT  23 AUG 94 / Mannesmann forecasts return to the black for the full year: German giant slashes first-half losses to DM27m Economic recovery, restructuring and the first trickle of profits from its new telecommunications division reduced Mannesmann's first-half losses to DM27m (Pounds 11.3m), from DM467m. Forecasting a return to profit for the full year after a 1993 deficit of DM513m, Mr Joachim Funk, chairman, said yesterday that more cost-cutting was needed and the group planned to expand foreign manufacturing 'rapidly'. 'Economic recovery does not mean Germany's structural problems are resolved,' he said in a letter to the workforce and shareholders. In the light of international price pressures, German costs were still too high. Total capital spending of DM761m was 6 per cent higher than in the first six months of last year. The domestic share fell 3 per cent, while investment abroad was up 50 per cent. The group reported a 12 per cent rise in exports to DM4.7bn and a 17 per cent jump in turnover to DM4.7bn at foreign subsidiaries. Group sales increased 10 per cent to DM14.2bn. The reduction in losses was helped by unspecified first-time profits from the D2 mobile telephone network, which incurred a DM240m deficit last year after launch costs. The network had 680,000 subscribers at the end of June, compared with 300,000 a year earlier, and a further 20,000 were signed up in July. Although no details were given, restructuring costs were also likely to be markedly lower than last year, when heavy redundancy and early retirement payments boosted the annual total to DM515m. Vehicle components and trading activities returned to the black. Tubes manufacture broke even in the review period, while core heavy engineering and the relatively small electrical business were still making losses. Although the value of plant construction contracts was down, group-wide incoming orders rose 19 per cent to almost DM17bn. Recovery in the international automotive industry pushed sales up 10 per cent while new orders rose 18 per cent. Job cuts reduced the workforce by 4 per cent. Lex, Page 16</p>

			<p><P> November 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WORLDS IN COLLISION;  </P> <P> MEAN SPIRIT BY LINDA HOGAN (ATHENEUM: $19.95; 370 PP.)  </P> <P> Linda Hogan, a Chickasaw writer with a fine reputation as a poet, has chosen as  the subject of her first novel the Oklahoma oil boom of the 1920s. The Indians  who had been forcibly resettled onto apparently worthless land suddenly found  themselves in possession of one of the country's richest oil fields -- to their  great misfortune. U.S. businessmen and government, as it happened, couldn't  bear the sight of a rich Indian, and although the history of Native Americans  since colonization is a fairly predictable story of betrayal and land theft,  this chapter is a particular shocker. Only a poet could have made it both  shocking and beautiful to read.  </P> <P> The novel is set in Watona, where Osage and Creek families live in farmhouses  above a great pool of oil, and one by one are turning up dead. An old  water-diviner named Michael Horse watches his fire and tries to piece together  the mystery. At church, the Rev. Joe Billy declares, "The Indian world is on a  collision course with the white world. . . . They are waging a war with Earth.  But, I say to you, our tears reach God."  </P> <P> But God seems to be elsewhere when oilmen arrive unannounced to pump out the  earth's black blood and pay the landowners as little as possible. When Moses  Graycloud goes to collect the annual royalty payment that must support his  family (since his land is ruined for farming), he's told that full-bloods now  get only 10%: $200. Any who argue are declared insane and appointed the wards  of white attorneys who handle their money. Some who can't pay their bills get a  loan from the benevolent rancher and oilman John Hale, who secures the loan  with a life-insurance policy on which he'll collect when they die. He never has  to wait long.  </P> <P> At the eye of the storm is Nola Blanket, beautiful daughter of the murdered  Grace Blanket, heir to her mother's enormous oil fortune but also cherished  progeny of the Hill People, who shun Watona's worldliness but send down four  silent guardians to watch over Nola.  </P> <P> She embodies every conflict of her time. She saw one of John Hale's men shoot  her mother, but if she reports this it surely will end her own life. She is a  child scarred by horror, but also a gentle, unearthly beauty who inspires love  and fear in her oppressors. She brilliantly defies her boarding-school  teachers, but then agrees to marry the son of her court-appointed warden  because she knows her presence in Moses and Belle Graycloud's home endangers  them. She spends her money on a wildly opulent wedding and extravagant gifts  for her people. When she becomes pregnant, she talks constantly to "her  future," the only thing left for her to trust.  </P> <P> Nola's story is woven together with that of Belle Graycloud, who listens to  bees and wears a meteorite around her neck; of Stacey Red Hawk, a smart Lakota  Sioux who tucks his braids into his hat and goes to Washington in hopes that  law enforcement can be made honest; of mute John Stink, who crawls from his  grave and walks the Earth more freely as a ghost than he could in life.  </P> <P> The tapestry is as well made as a good mystery novel, but equally compelling  for its vivid language and characters. When Belle Graycloud happens on a  truckload of sacred eagles "with the blue-white membranes of death closed over  their eyes," shot by hunters who will sell them for souvenirs, they look to her  "like a tribe of small, gone people, murdered and taken away in the back of a  truck." When Nola Blanket's husband gives her an emerald-green parrot, she  walks like an apparition to the window and sets it free.  </P> <P> This is North American magic realism; in the same way Gabriel Garcia Marquez  and Isabel Allende examine their political history with a conjurer's eye, Hogan  has wrapped wonder and magic around some brutal American truths. Neither magic  nor truth is diminished by the association.  </P> <P> The story, though relentlessly sad, is leavened throughout with a circumspect  humor, as when Michael Horse retreats to the hills to write a new chapter of  the Bible: The Book of Horse. He consults a dismayed priest for advice on how  to get it copyrighted and included in the Bible. Horse modestly tells him: "The  Bible is full of mistakes. I thought I would correct them. For instance, where  does it say that all living things are equal?"  </P> <P> "The priest shook his head. 'It doesn't say that. It says man has dominion over  the creatures of the earth.'  </P> <P> " 'Well, that's where it needs to be fixed. That's part of the trouble, don't  you see?' "  </P> <P> The stereotype of the stoic Indian who does not flinch as he's beaten was  probably invented by a guilty conscience. The Indians in this novel aren't  stoic. When they can, they laugh and make love; when they can't, they weep and  lock themselves in the cellar. When their own traditions can't guide them or  blunt their despair, they turn to liquor and Ouija boards. They aren't "other,"  they're ourselves.  </P> <P> Hogan has done one of the finest things a novelist can do: She's created  empathy. She carves a vast tragedy down to a size and shape that will fit into  a human heart. It's an important event, because this chance to fully realize a  point of view alien to our own -- this empathy -- is the thing that may just  save us in the end.  </P></p>

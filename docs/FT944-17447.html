			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / Polish TV licensing row Differences over licensing policy inside Poland's TV and Radio Council, a regulatory body, are delaying plans by Canal Plus, the French pay television channel, to go on the air. The French company, which has invested Dollars 4m in Poland and plans to invest another Dollars 36m, called on the council's new chairman Mr Janusz Zaorski to grant the licence promised last summer. The delay in signing the licence has given rise to fears that Mr Zaorski plans to grant the frequencies to another operator such as the Italian-owned Polonia network which failed to win a licence in the original contest but is held in higher regard by President Lech Walesa, who appointed Mr Zaorski. Canal Plus is also under pressure from Multichoice, owned by Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Data Corporation, which is marketing a pay TV service subtitled in Polish. Multichoice is also offering coded satellite channels like Filmnet and Discovery but has not gone through the expensive and time-consuming licensing procedures completed by Canal Plus. The French company yesterday called on the Radio and TV Council, to examine the legality of Multichoice's operations which threaten its profitability.</p>

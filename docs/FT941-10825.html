			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / Check-off system lifts union rolls A growing number of Britain's trade unions are reporting an increase in the size of their memberships as a result of a campaign to secure agreement from workers that their subscriptions can be paid directly from their pay packets by their employer. Initially it was widely thought that the legal requirement for worker acceptance of the so-called check-off system in the government's latest labour legislation would seriously cut union strength as a result of resistance or apathy. There are signs, however, that the opposite might be happening. Yesterday Mr Bill Morris, general secretary of the TGWU general union, said that it had received encouraging reports from its regional offices pointing to increased membership. 'This is happening across both regions and sectors with increases of 2 to 3 per cent,' he added. Similar growth is also apparent in early returns from the GMB general union, where increases of 4 per cent have been reported while in the AEEU engineering union there are no signs of any drop in members. The AEEU budgeted for a 10 per cent membership loss but Mr Gavin Laird, its general secretary, said yesterday this had been 'over-pessimistic'. Last month saw a slight growth. 'So far, so good,' said Mr Ron Edwards, the official co-ordinating the check-off campaign at the TUC yesterday. 'The members are responding.' Mr Edwards said the unions had found 'neither hostility nor apathy'. The approval of union members for check-off has to be achieved by August 29 under the law. 'We have no evidence that employers have withdrawn check-off facilities,' said Mr Edwards. 'I am much more optimistic about the check-off campaign than I used to be.' The TGWU yesterday launched a postal ballot of its members to win their approval for continuing to have a political fund. Last year the union allocated Pounds 2.4m of the Pounds 3m raised from members for the political fund to be used by the Labour party in affiliation fees at Pounds 3.12 per member.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Hague, March 23 (AFP) -- Yugoslavia filed a  complaint against NATO with the International Court of Justice  [ICJ], accusing its member states of violating the UN charter by  threatening to use force in Bosnia, a source at the court said  Wednesday [23 March].    The rump Yugoslavia -- Serbia and Montenegro -- said NATO  had  used the threat of force without the required authorization of  the UN Security Council.    Yugoslavia's suit cited the decision taken by the North  Atlantic Treaty Organization at a Feburary 9 meeting in Brussels  that warned Bosnian Serbs to withdraw heavy guns from Sarajevo  or face NATO air strikes.</p>

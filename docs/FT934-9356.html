			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / US agencies to pull out of Yangtze Project TWO US government agencies are to end their involvement in China's controversial Three Gorges project to build the world's largest dam on the Yangtze river. The Bureau of Reclamation, which is in charge of irrigation and water management in the US, and the Army Corps of Engineers, whose responsibilities include flood control and navigation, will sever their involvement in Three Gorges after they have completed work on a hydrological database. Although the bureau and corps had only a consulting role in Three Gorges, their withdrawal is a symbolic blow to the credibility of the project, which opponents charge will displace 1.3m people and flood nearly 100,000 hectares of China's best farmland. Competing with each other in the 1930s and 1940s, the two agencies symbolised an era of monumental civil engineering when the US believed it could bend nature to its will with ever bigger dams such as Bonneville, Hoover or Grand Coulee. The Bureau of Reclamation said its withdrawal from Three Gorges reflected the change in the agency's mission since the Clinton administration took office. 'We are not really in the dam-building business any more. We are a water resource management agency now,' a bureau spokeswoman said. The bureau falls under the aegis of Mr Bruce Babbitt, interior secretary, who has launched an ambitious attempt to transform the federal government into a better steward of the land and resources under its control. However, the US withdrawal is also a comment on the appropriateness of massive dams such as Three Gorges. 'We wouldn't support such a project in the US now, so it would be incongruous for us to support it in another country,' the bureau said.</p>

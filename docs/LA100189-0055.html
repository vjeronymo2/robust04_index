			<p><P> October 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JUST FOLLOWING THE LEADER  </P> <P> It should come as no surprise, but probably will, to the artsy-smartsy View  readers who have an abiding disdain for Lt. North, a retired U.S. Marine  colonel, that such a man would devote "14 hours a day, five or six days a week  . . . and is doing something for us somewhere, every day" according to John  Staggers of the Alliance to Save America's Future (SAFE).  </P> <P> This kind of work is tailor-made for North; after all, he has fought his  country's battles before with dedication and honor. If we are to fight a "war  on drugs," no one is better qualified to carry out that mission into the  streets than is North.  </P> <P> EDWIN O. LEARNARD, San Diego  </P></p>

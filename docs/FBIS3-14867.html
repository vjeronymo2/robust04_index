According to him, "It is not clear so far, what sort of  planes were shot down".    As soon as the first report about the incident was received,  the Russian Foreign Ministry got in touch with the Serbian  leadership, he told a press conference held in connection with a  visit of a delegation of NATO officials to Moscow.    The Serbian leaders were "utterly bewildered" as they could  not understand, why the Serbian planes should bomb Travnik, the  site of Croat-Moslem clashes, Churkin said.    "Whatever party should have made the military air raid in  Bosnia in violation of the relevant resolutions of the UN  Security Council on the no-fly zone, it bears the full measure  of responsibility for what has happened," he said. Military  planes of the belligerents must not fly over Bosnia, he  emphasized.    "If all the reported circumstances should be corroborated,  it  will be evident that the regime of the no-fly zone established  by a resolution of the UN Security Council was violated--with  all the resultant consequences.</p>

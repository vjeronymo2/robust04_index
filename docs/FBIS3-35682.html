			<p>Language: <F P=105> Latvian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Modris Posse: "Russia Threatens To Cut Natural </F> Gas Deliveries in Half"]    [Text] Riga, 18 Jan -- On 17 January, Russia presented an  official warning to state joint stock company "Latvijas Gaze  [LG]," in which it demanded a cardinal change, to take effect by  1 February, in the system of settling accounts for  already-consumed gas, otherwise deliveries will be cut by 50  percent.    As DIENA was told by LG Vice President Girts Stalbovics, gas  that has been pumped into the Underground Reservoir at Incukalns  (IPGK) in fact belongs to Russia, and Latvia has to pay for its  usage.    In summer of last year, the debts were almost paid, but as  the heating period of this year has started, the debt to Russia  for consumed gas, through the fault of irresponsible debtors,  has risen from 500,000 lats on 1 November 1993 to 16 million  lats on 16 January. In addition to these debts, there is also a  considerably high fine to pay, the amount of which G. Stalbovics  did not wish to reveal.    As a result of this, the output of industrial plants which  are using gas in their production, will decrease.    Owing to the fact that one of the greatest debtors is the  state joint stock company "Latvenergo," the population also will  suffer -- the enterprise uses primarily gas for heating. Due to  Russia's action, it will be forced to change the terms of heat  deliveries. Among the biggest debtors, G. Stalbovics also  mentioned the municipal heating enterprises and several building  administrators.    Until now, Russia was being appeased by promises, said G.  Stalbovics. To give Latvia a chance to settle its debts, Russia  is ready to take over a part of the IPGK and gas pipeline  system. A similar scheme was accepted by Estonia, which thus  made itself utterly dependent on Russian conditions for gas  deliveries. LG will take pains to pay so much that it will not  be forced to sign such an agreement, because Russia can also be  dependent on IPGK -- if there is any gas damage, the amount of  gas pumped into the reservoir would be sufficient to deliver it,  within reasonable limits, to Russia as well.</p>

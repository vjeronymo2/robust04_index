[Iglesias] The situation remained stable at a 4-percent  growth rate, and a recovery in the past few years. However, the  most important issue is the approval of the "Uruguay Round" of  GATT talks which has finally ended, and which I believe  represents a very important step forward for the future of  international trade.    I think that the importance of this round of talks is not  the  achievement of the goals we wanted, but the achievements  obtained since the talks began in 1986 in Punta del Este. I  think the situation is much better, although not as good as we  would have wished, especially for the developing countries. It  is very difficult to make progress in this field. The important  thing is that we currently have a much stronger GATT  organization in comparison with what it was in the past, and  consequently we now have an authority controlling trade  processes.    Issues that had been excluded from international talks are  now part of the negotiations. Progress has been made with the  incorporation of subjects like agriculture, textiles, and  services, which constitutes historic progress.    I think the round of talks has resulted in considerable  progress which implies historic change in international trade  procedures, bringing good perspectives for us. In the  agricultural field I do not think things are as we wished they  would be, but there has been considerable improvement in any  case regarding raw materials.    I can see encouraging international trade perspectives due  to  the situation in industrialized countries. The United States is  clearly undergoing a period of recovery, but this is not the  case in Europe and Japan, the other two great trade engines. In  general terms the perspectives for international trade are that  it will continue to improve over the next few years.    [EL PAIS] To what extent have your expectations of 1986,  when  you helped the GATT talks begin in Punta del Este, been met with  the conclusion of the Uruguay Round?    [Iglesias] It is clear that the objectives we then  established were very ambitious, and they gave us much harder  work than we thought. It is also true that had it not been for  those ambitious goals, we would have not been able to find a  balance through gains and concessions that allowed us to find a  negotiating point.    Seven years after the talks began it has been demonstrated  that international trade negotiations are complicated, but it is  possible to make progress in them.    The important issues of the Uruguay Round were two subjects:  On the one hand we have given a clear signal to restrict the  extension of protectionism, while on the other hand, at a moment  when the international situation is slow and full of crisis, the  news of the GATT results was a good revitalizing shock even in  some developed countries.    [EL PAIS] When do you think that the industrialized  countries  will recognize the rights of the countries that produce food and  raw materials with efficiency, like the members of the Cairns  Group, including Uruguay?    [Iglesias] That is very hard to predict. A step forward has  been taken which some think is very modest, while others do not  think so. The momentum to review the issue has begun, but I  cannot predict anything.    [EL PAIS] What are the differences between the progress  attained in the Tokyo Round of talks (1970) and the Uruguay  Round?    [Iglesias] The important thing is that the customs tariffs  have dropped further. But more important than that is the  inclusion of new subjects in GATT, and the strengthening of the  institutional structure of international trade. I think these  are the most important and original results, although there are  other subjects such as the mechanisms to solve controversies.    [EL PAIS] Although it may seem early to make this question,  do you think that a new round of negotiations within GATT must  take place at some point?    [Iglesias] I seriously doubt that a new round of talks  should  have to take place in the future. I do not dare to think that  another round of talks of this kind might take place for many  years. Some permanent negotiation mechanisms may turn up within  the new organization that will allow problems to be solved,  instead of holding these round of talks which imply an enormous  and unimaginable political effort such as the one made over the  past seven years.    I think that solutions may perhaps be sought through some  kind of negotiations within the organization that will be  created, taking into consideration sectors, problems, or  products.    [EL PAIS] What negotiation possibilities will developing  countries have within this new organization?    [Iglesias] For some developing countries, especially those  that produce food, the results may be harsh, because food prices  will tend to increase according to this structure. I think that  countries like ours must continue negotiating. I think the  Cairns Group has played an important role, as demonstrated by  the facts. I simply think we must continue struggling in favor  of international laws in this kind of negotiation.    [EL PAIS] What do you think of the economic situation in  Uruguay?    [Iglesias] The country is making necessary economic changes.  I think that the macroeconomic situation has been wisely  conducted, and if the international situation does not become  negative, our prospects for the future, within the current  terms, are of prudent optimism.    [EL PAIS] Uruguayan exporters feel affected by policy  maladjustments implemented in our country, leading to a drop in  exports. To what extent do you think the eventual loss of  competitiveness of our exports and the closing of international  markets is important?    [Iglesias] Our problems have become worse due to the drop in  prices of some goods, making it more difficult to compete  abroad, but I think that if we want to be part of an open club  it is absolutely necessary to go through the stage of adjusting  ourselves to becoming more competitive. This implies some  inevitable costs, which must be understood, and we must try in  as many ways as we can to overcome them. However, if we thought  all sectors should make profits we would not be recognizing the  mechanism of the integration process. It is inevitable that  some sectors should lose while others make a profit. The  important thing will be that at the end of the road we will all  be in better shape, and I think we will accomplish that once the  Common Market of the South [Mercosur] is strengthened.    [EL PAIS] What is the situation of the IDB now, during your  second term as head of the bank?    [Iglesias] We have gradually gained the trust of countries  in  the north as well as the trust of Latin American countries. We  have extended our sphere of action. We have improved the  dialogue with governments and civilian societies.    We think the bank has a very special characteristic. Latin  Americans think of it as something of their own, and they are  right. This has opened up different possibilities that are not  covered by other institutions, precisely because of that special  relation we have with governments, the public, and the private  sector in general. I envision the future with optimism because,  in one way or another, the region is beginning to show a  reaction.    We are giving priority to areas we think will be important  in  the near future. I can mention two essential areas: support to  social areas of the economy, something vital in this era when  reform processes demand renewed action in social programs; and  support to the private sector.    We think it is very important for the bank to continue  assisting the private sector. We are granting this assistance  through investment corporations, modestly, but with very good  results, such as in Uruguay. We want to go a step forward, and  the board of directors is studying the possibility of loaning  directly to the private sector, without government guarantees,  particularly for projects of infrastructure. That would give us  a new window to work on. It is early to anticipate a result,  but there are good possibilities.    Finally I would say that the big issue worrying me is how to  support small- and medium-sized enterprises which generally do  not have access to international financial sources. For me it  is an objective with a very high priority.    [EL PAIS] Has Uruguay efficiently used the resources  provided  by the bank?    [Iglesias] I think it has used our support efficiently and  in  a variety of ways. I am very happy with our image in Uruguay.  In 30 years the bank has loaned $1.2 billion to the country,  which in current values must be around $2 billion. We have  financed programs worth much more than that, because bank  contributions are only a part of the total program.    This strong bank presence has centered in very concrete and  specific areas, going from physical infrastructure to support  for economic reform programs. It has covered economic areas  such as milk or rice production and social areas such as  education, health, and housing.    I think this coverage will continue in the future if the  bank  can expand its capital base, as we all think it will.    [EL PAIS] What are the possibilities for obtaining  assistance  for the Plan III of Municipal Works that was presented by Juan  C. Raffo, transport and public works minister, and National  Mayors Congress President Sergio Chiesa in Washington last  October?    [Iglesias] The bank has financed many sanitary and drinking  water programs in Uruguay over the past 30 years. We think our  assistance to Montevideo is very important, because Montevideo  has half the population of the entire country. It is a joint  effort by the national government and City Hall.    We have done very well with Sanitary Plans I and II, which  are currently being implemented. I do not foresee any problems  for Plan III, or even Plan IV, which will complete the entire  network of Montevideo's sanitary infrastructure. With the  implementation of all these plans I think Montevideo can  rightfully aspire to becoming one of the most decontaminated  cities in Latin America.    [EL PAIS] What importance will the regional and subregional  groups -- such as Mercosur, NAFTA (Mexico, the United States,  and Canada), and those that have been reached in Central America  and the Caribbean -- have?    [Iglesias] I am in favor of those groups. I think it is a  new form of integration in Latin America. This is an open and  competitive integration. We are not resorting to the kinds of  closed mechanisms we had in other times.    I think we must say that the new Latin American philosophy  of  integration is not achieved in sacrificing the overall  relationship, but on the contrary, by strengthening it through a  general improvement of efficiency in the countries.    I believe that with that pragmatic and open idea the  subregional treaties have demonstrated that they are developing.  I am very impressed with the progress achieved by Colombia and  Venezuela, the latest developments within Mercosur, the new  frontiers that are being opened in Central America. It is  important to continue along that line.    The agreement among Mexico, the United States, and Canada is  a historic event in hemispheric relations, and I think it has  strengthened these regional mechanisms, which have become more  necessary than ever. I think this because somehow, in  negotiating possible membership in NAFTA, the fact that we are  participating as a group of countries facilitates negotiations,  and makes the agreement more feasible.    NAFTA opens a new opportunity to the hemisphere, and  beginning from there it strengthens the very subregional  integration schemes on which we must insist.    [EL PAIS] How do you view the development of Mercosur after  some of the difficulties that have emerged, and which have not  been fully overcome, in 1993?    [Iglesias] I think the structural problems prompted by these  integration schemes emerge when the countries are not yet in the  same situation. These differences in the macroeconomic  situations prompt difficulties and problems such as that of the  common import tariff.    But I would dare to say that in many aspects these  difficulties were avoidable. The political will is very strong,  and I can see it everywhere, and that is essential.    [EL PAIS] How long does Mr. Iglesias believe he will remain  as president of the IDB?    [Iglesias] It depends first on the contract I have with the  bank, which expires in four years. It will also depend on  whether the governments want me to continue to head this  institution, and of course it depends also on the will of God,  who has something to do with this business.    [EL PAIS] Have you considered any other future activity once  you conclude your term in office?    [Iglesias] No. My desire is to return to Uruguay, but by no  means have I thought what to do during that "century ahead,"  which means the next four years in the life in which we're  living.    [EL PAIS] Would you be a minister again in a Uruguayan  government?    [Iglesias] Look, I have no answer to that question. All the  options of my life are open, but for the time being my only  concern is basically to try to fulfill the objectives I have set  to see to it that, with the help of God, I might complete a  decade in the bank to do what I have proposed to do.    [EL PAIS] The planned economies have fallen, while  neoliberalism prevails. It is said that no alternative has been  found to this doctrine. What do you think?    [Iglesias] Look, I think it would take a long time to answer  that question. Each person interprets neoliberalism very  differently, so the first thing I would ask is how do you define  neoliberalism, and then I would offer my understanding of it.    I think the experience of the past few years has  demonstrated  that there are important limits to state voluntarism, and that  there are limits to be imposed on the people, starting from  above.    Therefore, if we understand neoliberalism in this manner, I  agree with it. Now, if what we understand by neoliberalism is  simply that the forces of the market can play without any type  of state presence or control as guardian of public interests, or  that the responsibilities inherent to an appropriate function  are not assumed, I would say that I do not agree with it.</p>

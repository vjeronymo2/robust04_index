			<p>940530 FT  30 MAY 94 / Emerging Markets: Locals bedevilled by outside distractions  -The Emerging Investor Last Friday offered distinct contrasts in sentiment on China's fledgling stock markets after President Clinton announced the renewal of China's privileged trade access to the US market. In Shanghai, particularly, but also in Shenzen, B shares denominated in US and Hong Kong dollars for foreign ownership recovered strongly as the indices of A shares for local investors finished down in lacklustre trading. After bottoming in April, Shanghai Bs rallied this month, in line with performance elsewhere in the Pacific Basin, excluding Japan. Most Favoured Nation renewal took them ahead of the pack on Friday, with a gain of 4.7 per cent, Shenzen rising 2.6 per cent in thin trading. However, local observers are not impressed. They note that the latest rally, which took Shanghai B shares up 12.5 per cent last week, was fuelled partly by the entry of Japanese investors into the market; but also that it follows a period of severe underperformance, with a preceding fall of 40 per cent this year. Their scepticism is based on the poor performance of A shares, in which the bulk of trading is conducted and which have lost more than two thirds of their value since their highs in early 1993. Investors, who had besieged the markets when trading began several years ago, have been deserting stocks in droves for bonds, currencies and futures  -although the latter form of investment has hit a rocky patch under the weight of tighter government regulation. Market managers seeking an explanation for what is now a protracted downturn  -the slide became a rout in the second half of last year - blame delays in the promulgation of a national securities law for the collapse of confidence. But while it is true that slow progress towards formulating a National Securities law, now in its ninth draft, has harmed confidence, there would seem to be other more telling factors. Among these is the psychology of the market. Inexperienced investors, starved of investment opportunities for so many years, plunged into equities (Shanghai opened in December, 1990 and Shenzen in July, 1991) without due regard for the quality of the stocks offered, or their earnings potential. Because of the limited number on offer, shares also enjoyed a scarcity value way out of proportion to likely returns. Inevitably, stock market fever cooled after the initial burst of enthusiasm, leaving a long trail of casualties. Indeed, hard-luck stock trading stories have become standard fare in the Chinese press. Some read like soap-opera scenes, with a surfeit of unhapping endings - including suicide. In one case, which captured particular attention, a wife sued successfully a securities company for her husband's suicide. The hapless stock trader had jumped to his death after losing millions in margin trading. The authorities, sensing that crumbling confidence in equities is harming a key element of their market reforms, have sought recently to bolster the markets, but this is likely to be a slow and complex process. Measures announced earlier this month included an effective freeze until next year on new stock listings and the requirement that companies seeking listings be obliged to undergo 'six-month-long coaching by relevant departments.' China had planned to issue some Yuan5.5bn (USDollars 634m) of A shares in 1994, a similar figure to last year. But this target clearly has been abandoned. The freeze on A share listings will not affect B shares. The authorities are committed to adding further listings to the 42 traded on the Shanghai and Shenzen bourses. China's official Business Weekly yesterday quoted an official of China Securities Regulatory Commission in Beijing as saying that, in an effort to lift the market, larger enterprises in energy, communications, transportation and railways would be considered for B share listings. The authorities are also seeking to crack down on stock market abuses such as widespread insider trading and wilful peddling of misleading information. Exacerbating the problem is the fact that companies and brokerage houses are all state-owned. The China Securities News, a Shanghai-based publication, reported last week that securities regulators and police were joining forces to stamp out market manipulation and fraud by securities company officials, company directors and even by stock market regulators themselves. Misuse of public funds in an evolving system where distinctions between public and private are often blurred is a considerable problem. In Shanghai in the first quarter of this year, the authorities reported 49 cases of stock-market speculation, involving public money of Yuan91.11m. Another factor bedevilling China's markets has almost certainly been the focus in the past year or so on listings abroad. Nine mainland companies were cleared for listing in Hong Kong last year, and another 22 are under consideration for primary listings abroad this year - both in Hong Kong and on other exchanges, such as New York and London. Foreign investors, including proliferating China funds, have tended to favour these opportunities above those on the mainland, partly because of greater confidence in the regulatory regimes of offshore exchanges and the discipline required of Chinese companies seeking listings abroad. All of this is proving an immense challenge for China's hard-pressed stock-market regulators, who are responsible for guiding what is largely an experimental market to maturity. With limited staff and resources, officials of the China Securities Regulatory Commission are being obliged to oversee a highly complex process that is far from immune to political interference. Not least of their problems is the artificial distinction between A and B shares. Ideally, the distinction should be removed, but this does not seem possible until the yuan becomes freely convertible, and that process may taken up to five years. In the meantime, another option might be to allow local Chinese to purchase B shares in foreign currency, but the worry is that this would almost certainly further devastate the A share market. For China's stock regulators there are no easy choices.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Ten best performing stocks  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                           27/5/94  Week on week change Stock                       Country  Dollar close    Dollars      %  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Migros                       Turkey    14.0673        3.9407   38.91 Brisa                        Turkey     0.0788        0.0184   30.56 Alarko Holding               Turkey     0.6116        0.1276   26.37 Companhia Vale do Rio Doce   Brazil     0.0944        0.0170   22.02 Semen Cibinong               Indonesia  3.6964        0.6453   21.15 Cia Souza Cruz Industria     Brazil     5.2065        0.7405   16.58 Cia Petroleos de Chile       Chile      3.4609        0.4706   15.74 Companhia Suzano (pref)      Brazil     3.5791        0.4619   14.82 Grupo Industrial Bimbo       Mexico     8.9124        1.0589   13.48 First Philippine Holding     Philipp.   3.9703        0.4648   13.26  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Baring Securities  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

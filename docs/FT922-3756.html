			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / Germans lay blame for Danish rejection Lack of transparency in EC policy-making is one reason for popular scepticism about further European integration, Germany's deputy finance minister argued yesterday. Mr Horst Ko'hler reaffirmed his country's commitment to further European integration despite the setback of the Danish vote against the Maastricht treaty last week. He was backed by other finance ministers, including Mr Guido Carli of Italy, who said that the Danish referendum result should strengthen rather than weaken EC states' resolve to maintain the tight economic discipline needed for economic and monetary union. But the ministers steered clear of the sensitive subject of treaty ratification during the formal business of their meeting. 'We are trying to continue business as usual, in line with the conclusions reached in Oslo,' said a spokesman for the Portuguese presidency of the EC. 'That is the clearest sign which could be given to the markets.' The proposed 1993-97 EC budget again came under attack during the meeting, with Germany, France, Belgium, the Netherlands and the UK coming out strongly against the planned hefty increase in EC spending. The so-called Delors II package would push up spending from Ecu66.6bn this year to Ecu87.5bn in 1997, at 1992 prices. Mr Ko'hler told journalists before the debate that the budget should not be merely a list of the Commission's wishes for which cash had to be found. Ministers also heard the tough judgments of the monetary committee of EC national treasury officials and the Community's financial watchdog, the Court of Auditors. Mr Cees Maas, the Dutch treasury official who heads the monetary committee, told ministers that 'cohesion' funds for poorer EC members should not be released until those nations had achieved strict economic convergence targets. The poorer southern countries argue they need the funds first to help them meet the targets. The Court of Auditors, which was asked to report on the lessons of past budget plans, has warned of the risk of losing control of spending in key areas of the budget, notably agriculture and structural funds. Earlier, ministers gave their broad backing to Spain's plans for convergence. Mr Pedro Perez, the Spanish secretary of state for finance, said Spain believed the plan was right for the economy with or without EMU, whose future has been clouded by a Danish vote last week to reject the Maastricht Treaty. The programme, which has already been approved by Madrid, would cut the government spending deficit to 1 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) by 1996 from 4.4 per cent last year. The finance ministers were expected to be up until late last night tackling the difficult technical questions of VAT harmonisation and common capital rules for the European securities industry.</p>

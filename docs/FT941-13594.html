			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: A pessimistic analysis of executive demand Sir, Michael Dixon, in his swan song on MSL's latest statistics of executive demand ('Turn of the tide is confirmed', January 19), doubts 'annual demand will ever again rise to even near the 40,202 tally of 1988'. In 1993 the reported total demand was 16,309, being 13.3 per cent up on 1992, and, while the rate at which the tide is coming in is as yet uncertain (another couple of quarters information will help), a figure in excess of 19,000 is probable for 1994 (an increase of more than 17 per cent). In the four years from June 1981 to June 1985 the index more than doubled (recurring annual increases of 19 per cent) during a period when inflation averaged 6.2 per cent (per the Retail Prices Index). At this stage in the economic cycle, and with initial indications that the previously lagging indicator of total unemployment is reacting more promptly to increased growth (which, on the most recent evidence, is also exceeding expectations), I feel his analysis is unduly pessimistic. This specific index may, if it is not amended for structural changes in recruitment methodology and employment practices (such as short-term contracting, interim management and temporary executives) fall short of previous highs. But there are no underlying reasons why total executive employment in the reactive 1990s should be less than in the previous decade. What will change is the means by which executives are obtained, reflecting both the increasingly flexible resourcing requirements of employers and the relative size of the particular businesses and organisations concerned. As recently as January 1992, when I was helping a client review its banking facilities, the bank was surprised to be questioned on the terms of an overdraft facility at 0.5 per cent over base rate with a minimum of 7.625 per cent as it could never envisage rates coming down to these levels] Chris Smith, chief executive, Cumbergold, 67 Princess Victoria Street, Clifton, Bristol BS8 4DD</p>

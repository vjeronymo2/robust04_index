			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / US business turns leaner and meaner: Moves towards financial health The euphemisms vary but the song remains the same: whether it is called 'restructuring', 'downsizing' or 'reshaping to better meet the challenges of the 1990s', corporate America is swallowing a medicine-chest full of special charges aimed at improving its long-term financial health. A succession of large fourth-quarter restructuring charges have been reported over the past few weeks by companies as varied as Bethlehem Steel, the second largest US steel producer; United Technologies, the aero-engine manufacturer; Du Pont, the chemical group; CSX, the railway operator; Kodak, the photographic group; and Xerox, the image reproduction company. And one of the biggest is yet to come: General Motors, the largest company in the US, is expected to take a pre-tax write-off approaching Dollars 3bn (Pounds 1.6bn) over the next week or two when it reports a huge 1991 loss. The fourth quarter of any year is traditionally the time of heaviest write-offs, but the previous quarters of 1991 have also produced some big hits against earnings. In the third quarter, for example, they came from companies as varied as Citicorp, the bank, American Express, the charge-card business, Tenneco, the industrial conglomerate, and the Union Pacific Railroad. In short, 1991 will go down as a record year for charges by corporate America. But why, and what does this tell us about the future competitiveness of US business? First, some statistical history: charge-offs by US companies last showed a big upward leap in the mid-1980s, peaking in 1987 when the companies which make up the Standard &amp; Poor's Index of 500 large US businesses collectively wrote off a net Dollars 2.65 a share, compared with reported earnings of Dollars 17.50, according to estimates compiled by securities house Shearson Lehman Brothers. The causes were many and complex, and included bank write-offs of Third World loan losses, big restructurings by heavy manufacturing industry and telecommunications, the restructuring of the chemicals sector and Dollars 4.9bn of charges from oil company Texaco, stemming mainly from a legal battle with Pennzoil. The level of charges dipped in 1988 but have been on an upward trajectory every since, reaching Dollars 3.17 a share in 1990, compared with earnings of Dollars 21.34, and are expected to end at around Dollars 4.70 a share for 1991. The figures include charges from many factors other than corporate restructurings. Over the past two years, for example, banking and securities industries have had to write off many bad loans made to the property sector and leveraged buy-outs in the late 1980s, and there have been some big provisions for settlement of legal disputes. Furthermore, from 1991 companies have begun taking big charges because of a change in the rules on their accounting for health benefits for retired staff. These charges do not involve any drain of cash and neither do many of the big write-downs taking place to cover plant and equipment. So, while corporate America is paying out large sums in redundancy, the figures being reported by many companies are somewhat misleading in terms of cash flow. And this helps explain why the stock market tends to shrug them off, or even buy a company's shares on restructuring news. There seem at least six intertwined reasons for this degree of restructuring. First, and probably most important, such action is hardly surprising at this point in the economic cycle: the US has been in or near recession for more than 18 months, and many companies which face severe competition and price pressures, or have lost market share, need to improve their productivity. The fat they were able to carry in the 1980s, during the longest US economic expansion on record, is now simply too heavy. General Motors is a prime example of this. During the 1980s its share of the US car market plunged from around 47 per cent to 35 per cent but its financial strength in a booming market allowed it to put off the rationalisation this loss of customers demanded. Now it has to bite the bullet, and the charge it is likely to make this month will help cover the cost of cutting 70,000 jobs and closing 21 plants. Second, the restructuring charges of the past few years are a response to the takeover wave of the 1980s. During the second half of that decade companies which looked vulnerable to a bid by corporate raiders set about improving their efficiency, as well as erecting a panoply of anti-takeover devices. The takeovers which did occur, whether launched by raiders or industrial bidders, left the merged companies with plenty of scope for rationalisation. The takeover wave ebbed dramatically in 1991, but the year nevertheless produced a succession of banking mergers which led to large restructuring charges, as well as AT&amp;T's takeover of computermaker NCR, which produced a Dollars 4.2bn charge. Third, restructuring charges in some sectors stem simply from secular decline. This is particularly so in the US defence industry, which is having to adjust to an era of rapidly shrinking Pentagon equipment budgets. Fourth, many companies are restructuring because of growing foreign competition as world markets become more global. Again, the Detroit motor industry, under increasing pressure from Japanese rivals, is a prime example. Fifth, technological changes are forcing companies to adapt. Bethlehem Steel, for example, has made more than Dollars 1bn of charges in the past two years to cover the restructuring of businesses where it is no longer competitive with mini-mills, which use more efficient production methods. Sixth, unlike the restructurings of the mid-1980s, this one is hitting America's service industries - ranging from banking to fast-food outlets - which are expected to face big productivity pressures through the 1990s. For example, the large charges by the railroads are mainly to cover a change from three-man crews to two-man crews. All this would appear to bode well for corporate earnings over the next few years. Most of corporate America should emerge from recession leaner and fitter. Mr Michael Sherman, chief investment strategist at Shearson Lehman, says: 'If we're right about recovery this summer, we will see a large remission in terms of write-offs.' He also points out that the US has hardly been ignoring capital investment during this period, which has far outstripped write-offs in terms of dollars per share. Furthermore, many companies may be taking larger write-offs than they need immediately to cover trouble they see ahead. 'They think that if they're going to disappoint shareholders with earnings now, they might as well go the whole hog,' says David Blitzer, chief economist at Standard &amp; Poor's. The lesson for the rest of the world, then, is that US industry is likely to emerge from recession a tougher competitor. Mr Neuhauser of KPMG Peat Marwick argues that many US businesses which have restructured are now in a better competitive position than foreign rivals, especially those in Europe, where he sees large amounts of under-used plant and assets. 'My assessment,' he says, 'is that we will see a lot more of this coming in Europe.'  ----------------------------------------------------- CORPORATE AMERICA  ----------------------------------------------------- Recent write-offs              (Dollars)  ----------------------------------------------------- General Motors (est)           3.00bn Citicorp                       1.64bn United Technoligies            1.53bn CSX                              755m Eastman Kodak                    597m Bethlehem Steel                  575m Union Pacific                    575m Tenneco                          504m Dupont                           470m American Express                 265m Chrysler                         257m Xerox                            175m  ----------------------------------------------------- Research: Rivka Nachoma  -----------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS parliamentary correspondent Ivan Novikov] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 16 TASS -- State Duma member and former  finance minister Boris Fedorov, an arch rival of chief banker  Viktor Gerashchenko, resumed attacks on the Central Bank of  Russia by proposing his own lawbill on the main financial  institution of the country which caused bitter opposition of its  representatives.    Deputy Chairman of the Central Bank Aleksandr Khandruyev  told  the Duma subcommittee on credit and monetary policy on Monday  that the lawbill is "contradicting the constitution in the main  provision regarding the independence of the Central Bank from  executive and legislative authorities".    Fedorov proposed to set up an observers' council for the  Central Bank. Besides, he envisaged a possibility for the  Finance Ministry to temporarily suspend the activities of the  Central Bank which cannot be done even by the president and the  prime minister.    Khandruyev said that the lawbill establishes "collective  leadership" for the bank which contradicts the constitution.    Fedorov fired back by saying that he was surprised by "the  unconstructive position of the Central Bank".    Khandruyev's bitter criticism of the document was not shared  by other people participating in the discussion.    Deputy Finance Minister Andrey Kazmin qualified the lawbill  as "a serious attempt to establish a law of direct action for  the Central Bank". Chairman of the Association of Russian Banks  Vyacheslav Zakharov said the document "favourably differs" from  the one drafted by the Central Bank itself, but admitted that  the influence of the Finance Ministry, which Fedorov used to  head, can be seen in it.    The subcommittee recommended the Duma to consider Fedorov's  lawbill as an alternative to the draft of the Central Bank.</p>

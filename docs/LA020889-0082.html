			<p><P> February 8, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Hundreds of troops reportedly infuriated over the size of a pay raise rampaged  through the streets of Port Moresby, the capital of Papua New Guinea,  assaulting passers-by and destroying government property. Witnesses in the  southwest Pacific nation said the soldiers blocked traffic and attacked  journalists before police fired tear gas to disperse them. Australian  Associated Press said the soldiers were angry over the raise, reportedly the  first in 14 years, charging that it benefited only officers. Papua New Guinea,  a former U.N. Australian trust territory, became independent in 1975.  </P></p>

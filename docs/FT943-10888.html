			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / Battle looms as US group bids Dollars 8.5bn for Cyanamid The spate of deals reshaping the US drugs industry looked set to continue yesterday as a battle loomed for control of American Cyanamid, a US healthcare and agricultural products group. American Home Products, whose interests range from prescription drugs to confectionery, offered Dollars 8.5bn (Pounds 5.48bn) in cash for Cyanamid. Its bid of Dollars 95 a share compared with a market price of Dollars 63 3/4 before trading in Cyanamid's stock was suspended yesterday afternoon. The bid came hours after it emerged that SmithKline Beecham, the Anglo-American drugs group, is in talks about acquiring Cyanamid's pharmaceuticals and healthcare products businesses. That proposal would involve SmithKline Beecham swapping its own vaccine and animal health businesses for the Cyanamid units. The all-cash nature of the Home Products bid raised the spectre of a break-up of Cyanamid, with proceeds from the sale of parts of the company being used to pay part of the acquisition costs. Home Products reported borrowings of around Dollars 1bn and shareholders' funds of Dollars 3.9bn as at the end of 1993. Last year, Cyanamid is estimated to have generated about Dollars 1.4bn of its Dollars 4.3bn of sales from prescription drugs, with another Dollars 1bn from human vaccines, Dollars 500m from other healthcare products and Dollars 1.4bn from agricultural products. The Home Products offer was detailed in a letter the company said it had sent to Mr Albert Costello, Cyanamid's chairman and chief executive. Home Products said the offer was subject to approval by its own board, as well as by US anti-trust authorities and the elimination of any defences Cyanamid had put up against a takeover. Also, in an apparent reference to the SmithKline Beecham talks, it said the deal was dependent on Cyanamid not making any significant asset sales. Home Products' intervention was expected to meet with a cold response from Cyanamid, though the large premium over yesterday's market price suggested that Cyanamid's board could be forced to accept the offer unless a better deal is proposed. Under Mr Costello, the company is half way through a wide-ranging restructuring, which has involved it spinning off its chemicals business and announcing big cuts in its drugs business. If it was to be completed, a Home Products takeover would be the biggest acquisition in the US drugs industry since the merger wave of 1989, which created industry giants such as SmithKline Beecham and Bristol-Myers Squibb.

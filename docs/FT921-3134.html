			<p>920316 FT  16 MAR 92 / Election 92: A family open to persuasion - At least a quarter of voters have yet to make up their minds, or say they might change their minds. Among them is the Martin family who live in the heart of the West Midlands, one of the election's pivotal regions. Paul Cheeseright will write throughout the campaign about how the Martins see the politicians The Martins need to be persuaded. They owe no allegiance to any political party. Their voting has shifted from election to election. They do not even agree with each other. In 1987, Lyn and Tony went to the polling station in amiable argument: Lyn voted Conservative, Tony went for the Alliance. This time it looks as if the family again will make up its mind at the last minute. But there is a new element in the TV watching and political discussion at their home in Keswick Road, Solihull, near Birmingham. Lyn and Tony's eldest son, Russell, votes for the first time. 'I'm open to persuasion too,' he said. While Solihull is a safe Conservative seat, the family is typical of those in the West Midlands who, because of its number of marginal constituencies, will help to decide who forms the next government. Among the Martins, it looks so far that, of the main party leaders, Neil Kinnock looks as if he has the most persuading to do. Tony finds him 'brash'. Lyn reckons that even Mrs Thatcher didn't wind her up in the way Mr Kinnock does. Tony said: 'There was a party political broadcast the other night and it was the shadow chancellor, John Smith. He, to me, came over 100 times better than Neil Kinnock has ever done. There'd be more votes for Labour if he was leading.' The low-key approach of Mr Major has gone down best with the Martin household. Tony observed: 'I don't dislike him, to be honest. He was thrown in at the deep end. He was lumbered with the poll tax. If he doesn't get back, a lot of it will be down to the poll tax.' Lyn added: 'Like that Mr Smith I watched the other night, Mr Major talks to you, he doesn't dictate to you.' For the moment, Russell, who is 18, used only to government by Thatcher and heir of Thatcher, is a little bemused. 'I can't see what it would be like to have Labour or the Liberal Democrats in.' He keeps up with the news via the television and the Daily Express but he confesses that he does not have that much interest in politics. 'Not particularly. No. To be honest, I don't. I don't think many girls or lads of my age are interested in politics.' Lyn and Tony cannot afford to be detached. The recession has hurt during a period of rising family costs. They both work - Tony is a driver and warehouseman at Michelin, the tyres company, and Lyn is a ward clerk at East Birmingham Hospital. Between them, if Tony works overtime, they earn about Pounds 20,000 a year. Russell is a police cadet - 'Ever since I was about five I wanted to be a policeman; I suppose it's every little boy's ambition.' - Westley, the second son, is 14, and Keeley, Lyn's and Tony's daughter, is 10. The semi-detached house is getting cramped. Lyn and Tony, in their early 40s, have always lived on the south-east side of Birmingham. They started in a council flat, saved for a house and took out a mortgage of Pounds 2,500. They took another house and trebled the mortgage, bought their present home and trebled it again. Interest payments on the mortgage have been the worst part of the recession. Lyn and Tony have also been caught up in changing economic conditions. Tony was made redundant in 1989 although he was never out of a job. The part of East Birmingham Hospital that Lyn works in is taking trust status next year so her job, but not her pay, is being revamped. With all this in the background, Mr Lamont's Budget was significant, but not necessarily significant enough. 'The Budget did us no favours,' said Tony. 'I admire him (Mr Lamont) in one way in that it wasn't an election budget, but there wasn't enough in it for me personally.' 'They give you money in one way and take it back in another,' rejoined Lyn. True, there was some help for businesses. 'They've done it too late,' asserted Tony. 'But at least they're helping them before it goes any further,' argued Lyn. 'Yes, but even the big firms are struggling,' Tony came back. 'There's not enough in it to influence the way we'd vote.' But he is not leaning towards Labour either. The Martins have a problem. Lyn says she is not leaning towards Labour at the moment, 'I suppose because my dad had his own business, only the Conservatives helped them out. My mum and my brother-in-law had council houses. The Conservatives enabled them to buy them.' Yet, looking back over the years since Mrs Thatcher took power her approval of what has been done in the economy is qualified. 'We've got our moans and groans, but we could have been worse off.' The 'moans and groans' go to the heart of the election debate. They concern health and education and spill into issues such as social discipline. Lyn has a personal interest in health, not just because she works in a hospital but because she had an operation last November and has been on sick leave since. 'When I was in hospital,' she recalled to Tony, 'you went mad when I was discharged because they needed the bed for somebody else.' There are also fears about schools. 'Schools at one time had a sixth form,' said Lyn. 'Westley has just taken his options. He's not sure what he wants to do but I think he's going towards being a teacher. But the opportunities  -there not being a sixth form at his school - are limited.' Everything in the election debate is, of course, for the good of the country: high taxes, low taxes, more individual freedom, less individual freedom, soft on law and order, hard on law and order - the words cascade. 'We've started to listen to them all,' said Tony. 'At the moment we're a bit like this . . . ' and his hands waved vaguely.</p>

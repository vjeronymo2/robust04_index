			<p>BFN     [Text] On 20 June the Dushanbe government and opposition  may be expected to resume negotiations in Tehran and that,  according to the Commander in chief of Russia's border troops  Andrey Nikolayev, will likely escalate tension on the  Tajikistan-Afghanistan border.    Practice showed, Nikolayev said, that in the runup to, and  during, the negotiations the opposition would try to do a bit of  muscle-flexing and put pressure on Dushanbe. In addition, he  said, the opposition's negotiating team might fail to control,  in full measure, the opposition's field commanders. A third  force could instigate fighting and he who paid, Nikolayev said,  would want an interest on his investment.    Nikolayev withheld his view of the possibility of agreement  between the opposition and those who were holding power in  Dushanbe. He said, nonetheless, that agreement was possible if  both sides came to put the people's interests above their own.    Nikolayev admitted that Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan failed to  meet, in full measure, their pledge to protect Tajikistan's  external border.</p>

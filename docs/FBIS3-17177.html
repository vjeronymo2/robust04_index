Other officers of the notorious former Soviet secret police  are to follow Noviks and be put to prison, maintains the daily  "Diena", indicating that a surge of arrests of other colleagues  of Noviks and those directly involved in repressions which have  been carried out in Latvia, is to be expected in the near  future. Evidences are being collected and witness interrogated  in probes of several other offices of the former KGB who are  facing the same charges as their former chief. Up to now many  victims of the past repressions have feared to give evidence and  to turn in documentary evidences of criminal activities by  Alfons Noviks and executors of his orders, said Dainis Vanags,  chairman of the committee of totalitarian crimes investigation.  However, during the last two months people have become more  active in supplying the committee with numerous materials of  help in investigating the cases.</p>

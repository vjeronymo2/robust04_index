			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / Russians baffled by petrol shortage 'You do not expect Newcastle to run out of coal. In Demerara there are no lines for sugar,' said a Moscow daily as irate Muscovites, waiting at petrol stations in sub-zero temperatures in long queues, struggled to understand why the capital city of one of the world's main oil producers should be suffering from an acute petrol shortage. At the height of the fuel shortage last weekend, when only a handful of commercial stations in this city of 9m people were selling petrol and diesel fuel, prices soared to as much as ten times their usual level. The state-run stations which dominate Moscow's retail petrol trade had no fuel at all. This weekend, Moscow's mayor, Mr Yuri Luzhkov, responded to the crisis by withdrawing licences from more than 10 petrol retail companies accused of 'profiteering' from the shortage by increasing prices. But the new-style commercial 'profiteers' were responding to a crisis which was, in large measure, caused by old-style state planning. To protect Muscovites - who retain a sense of special entitlement from the Soviet days when the capital city was always supplied with consumer goods unavailable in the provinces - from recent increases in the price of petrol and diesel, city authorities decreed that fuel should be sold at artificially low rates. As in the era of central planning, when all Soviet citizens could buy bread for pennies a loaf but paid for the privilege with hours spent in queues, Moscow's artificially low fuel prices inspired drivers from the provinces to flood into the city, provoking a shortage. The problem was exacerbated when, at the height of what Muscovites call 'the petrol crisis', the Moscow fuel refinery reportedly suffered a breakdown and suspended shipments to the city. A conspiracy theory was readily supplied for the refinery's timely equipment failure. It was suggested that the plant's management preferred not to sell fuel at unprofitably low rates. They are now pointing to the timely repair of the refinery earlier this week, shortly after Mr Luzhkov brought state prices in Moscow for petrol and diesel fuel back into line with the rest of the country. But even at the new, higher prices of between Rbs400 and Rbs500 (between 12 and 16 US cents) a litre for petrol, the drivers of the gleaming new Mercedes - which clog Moscow streets with western-style traffic jams - pay artificially low prices for their fuel. Russian oil producers are understandably unhappy about supplying their compatriots at these rates and, beginning on January 1 - when the system of quotas and licences for oil exports are to be abolished - they will be freer to look for more profitable markets abroad. Their eagerness to do so is likely to be increased by the non-payments crisis which is one of the reasons cited by Russian officials to justify their reluctance to fully liberalise domestic fuel prices. However, even at the current low rates, many state consumers of fuel - in Moscow most notably the state-run transport system and the municipal infrastructure - have been simply not paying their fuel bills. Mr Luzhkov's decision to crack down on 'profiteering' petrol stations may appease Muscovites angry at queuing for fuel in a city where rapidly growing oil fortunes are ostentatiously displayed at newly established, wildly expensive night clubs and casinos. But unless Russia's avowedly reformist new government soon addresses the distortion of an economy in which many of the constraints on profitable producers have been lifted, but consumers and social service providers still expect the artificial shelter of a planned economy, Muscovites should not expect this petrol crisis to be their last.</p>

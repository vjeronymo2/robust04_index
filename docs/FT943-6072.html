			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / International Company News: Abnormal charges put MIM in red MIM Holdings, the Queens-land-based metals and mining group, yesterday announced a ADollars 195.1m (USDollars 145m) loss after tax in the year to end-June, largely resulting from heavy abnormal charges. In the previous year, it made a ADollars 74m profit, writes Nikki Tait. Revenues were ADollars 2.31bn, up from ADollars 2.02bn previously. MIM is paying a final dividend of 2.5 cents a share, after a similar interim.</p>

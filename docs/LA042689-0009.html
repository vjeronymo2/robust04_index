			<p><P> April 26, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PARLIAMENT STALEMATE MAY BE BROKEN;  </P> <P> TAKESHITA'S PLAN TO QUIT BRINGS RELIEF  </P> <P> With its promise of breaking a two-month stalemate in Parliament, Prime  Minister Noboru Takeshita's declaration that he will resign brought a sense of  relief to both politics and economics in Japan on Tuesday, even though the  choice of a successor remained unclear.  </P> <P> Prices rose for the third-largest gain this year on the Tokyo Stock Exchange,  and the yen's value climbed slightly on the Tokyo Foreign Exchange Market.  </P> <P> The ruling Liberal Democratic Party dropped its defensive posture toward an  opposition boycott of Parliament by resuming deliberations unilaterally on the  fiscal 1989 budget. In his resignation announcement, Takeshita made passage of  the budget a condition for stepping down.  </P> <P> Deliberations had been halted Feb. 28 as opposition parties refused to proceed  unless former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, also of the ruling party, was  forced to testify about his involvement in the spreading influence-buying  scandal that eventually brought down Takeshita, his successor.  </P> <P> Japanese in the streets expressed relief, repeating, as if in unison, "It's  only natural," when asked about Takeshita's surprise announcement in a  televised news conference.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Apologizes to People  </P> <P> Announcing his intention to resign, the 65-year-old prime minister apologized  to the people for a scandal involving political contributions and questionable  stock dealings that has enveloped him, Nakasone and dozens of other  politicians, bureaucrats and leading businessmen.  </P> <P> The scandal centered on the widespread influence-buying activities of Recruit  Co., a conglomerate with employment agencies, information, computer and real  estate interests.  </P> <P> Speculation on a successor focused on Masayoshi Ito, 75, chairman of the ruling  party's executive board. Ito, who is reported to suffer from diabetes, declared  that a younger leader should be chosen. But when asked if he would accept a  draft, he said he would "not reply to a hypothetical question."  </P> <P> Ito, who is one of the few ruling party leaders whose name has not been linked  to the scandal, has a reputation for independence and integrity. Known as a  "progressive bureaucrat" in the Agriculture Ministry before turning to  politics, Ito served as foreign minister under former Prime Minister Zenko  Suzuki until he resigned in 1981.  </P> <P> Also mentioned as a possible successor is Masaharu Gotoda, chairman of a ruling  party committee on political reform. He served as chief Cabinet secretary under  Nakasone. Gotoda, too, is untainted by Recruit's money.  </P> <P> An investigation of the Recruit scandal by prosecutors is continuing and may  not end before the Liberal Democrats select a new party president.  </P> <P> By virtue of its commanding majority in the lower house, which elects the prime  minister, the ruling party is ensured of making its president Japan's next  leader.  </P> <P> "Anything could happen in this kind of crisis situation," said Takashi  Inoguchi, a professor of political science at Tokyo University.  </P> <P> With an election for the upper house of Parliament to be held this summer, a  leader capable of convincing voters of his determination to clear up the  Recruit scandal and carry out reform is considered essential.  </P> <P> Inoguchi said Takeshita's resignation and the ensuing confusion in political  leadership will "slightly weaken the government's position in international  issues for the time being." But the change may not be that noticeable, he said.  </P> <P> "Our bureaucracy has been working on a routine basis," he said. "We don't have  to worry too much about the repercussions. It's not like the American system,  where the politicians reign supreme."  </P> <P> The feeling of relief swept the floor of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, traders  said. The market rallied for a gain of 438.86 points on the Nikkei stock index  to close at 33,244.78.  </P> <P> </P> <P> NTT Among the Gainers  </P> <P> Conspicuous among the gainers was Nippon Telegraph &amp; Telephone Corp., the  telecommunications giant whose top executives were implicated in the Recruit  affair. NTT closed at 1.56 million yen ($12,000) a share, a 9% increase in the  share price.  </P> <P> Takeshita's announcement was a spark for the rally, said David Wood, an analyst  for Tokyo Securities Co. "There are obviously lingering doubts," evidenced by a  thin trading volume Tuesday, "but I think this is a pretty good indication that  some of the pressure has been relieved," he said.  </P> <P> Foreign exchange dealers also were heartened by the prospects for the  resumption of Parliament business. The yen rose in value against the dollar by  0.21 yen to close at 131.17.  </P> <P> Freed by Takeshita's announcement to proceed with the budget process, ruling  party leaders threatened to pass the budget in the lower house unilaterally, if  necessary, before the prime minister leaves Saturday for a nine-day tour of  nations belonging to the Assn. of Southeast Nations.  </P> <P> Such a unlateral move would ensure final enactment by the end of May. Japan's  constitution specifies that the budget be enacted if the upper house fails to  vote within 30 days of approval by the lower house.  </P> <P> Lack of an official budget has stalled both public works spending and approval  of new overseas aid projects.  </P> <P> Opposition parties, however, warned that the ruling party would face serious  consequences if it rammed the budget through Parliament, as it did with  controversial tax reform legislation amid a Christmas Eve filibuster.  </P> <P> "If they cut off deliberations and railroad through the budget, they will face  the condemnation of the people and have no choice but to dissolve the lower  house," said Ichiro Watanabe, a lower house member of the moderate Komeito, or  Clean Government Party.  </P> <P> Osamu Yatabe, a lawmaker who heads the Socialist Party's committee on the  Recruit affair, said there is no room for compromise on an opposition demand  for testimony by Nakasone that sparked the boycott.  </P> <P> "It would be too late for Nakasone to testify after the budget passes," Yatabe  said. "If it comes down to the ruling party railroading the budget through, the  opposition parties are going to have to resort to joint action, and there will  be political trouble."  </P> <P> The Recruit affair first came to public notice last summer in news reports. By  December, Takeshita's support in opinion polls had started to plummet. But he  withstood mounting calls from the opposition to resign, largely because both of  his potential rivals -- Shintaro Abe, the ruling party's secretary general, and  Kiichi Miyazawa, former finance minister -- also had been tainted in the  scandal and forced to resign. In an attempt to revive support, Takeshita  declared that he would carry out reforms to end Japan's "money politics."  </P> <P> But early this month, new revelations showed that the prime minister had  received far larger benevolence from Recruit than reported earlier.  </P> <P> On April 11, he had delivered in Parliament what he billed as a full  explanation of his ties with Recruit. He admitted that he and his aides had  received a total of $1.15 million in political contributions and stock profits  from Recruit.  </P> <P> JAPAN SHAKE-UP -- TRADE TIES -- Takeshita's resignation shouldn't affect  Japan's economic relations with U.S. Business, Page 1  </P> <P> RECRUIT CO. -- Firm's behavior shows ties between government and business in  Japan.

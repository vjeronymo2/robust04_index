			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / Arts: Avignon Festival YESTERDAY the barricades went up in Avignon. The ones in front of the Palais des Papes, that is, put there by the organisers of this year's Avignon Festival. They are to prevent members of the audience, who swarm in the square from 9 pm onwards, from entering the Cour d'Honneur of the Papal Palace until the last possible moment. At about 9.40, when the sun has started to go down, one small entry-point appears and the crowd surges towards it. Squashed together like sardines, people eventually enter the precincts in single file to seek the sanctuary of a rickety seat in an auditorium roofed by the night-sky. Appropriately enough it is a celebrated siege that is being enacted in one of the opening productions. This is the siege of Numantia in 134 BC, carried out by Scipio Africanus in fulfilment of the Roman Senate's delenda est Carthago policy. According to your point of view, you can see this as either a great Roman victory or a feat of heroic resistance on the part of the inhabitants, comparable to that of the Jews at Masada. As a Spanish patriot, Cervantes, whose dramatic re-creation of the ruthless operation is being presented, emphasises the valour of the Numantians. His plays have always been over-shadowed by Don Quixote and are often summarily dismissed as no more than 'a little Senecan rhetoric' (Brenan). It will be interesting to see whether this production by Robert Cantarella in the Cloister of the Carmelites, with a company drawn from all over France and a new translation of the text, will cause that rating to change. Cervantes's great rival, the immensely industrious Lope de Vega, is the first author to occupy the Cour d'Honneur this year. His drama depicts an equally ruthless siege, but one of the heart - the heart of Dona Ines, taken captive by the eponymous Chevalier of Olmedo. The production is by the Catalonian director, Llus Pasqual. The work corresponds in Spanish theatrical tradition to our Romeo and Juliet, but instead of a nurse to console the heroine, there is a procuress to arrange assignations. A staging of a version of Calderon's Life is a Dream filtered through the mind of Pier Pasolini will complete Avignon 92's tribute to the Golden Age of Spain. On a more contemporary, but also predominantly Hispanic, note there is Los Caminos de Frederico again moulded by Pasqual - a recital in Spanish from Lorca. Georges Lavaudant's play Terra Incognita about his discovery of Mexico in 1985, is being staged out at Les Taillades, that pretty village 30 kilometers away from Avignon, put on the theatrical map by Peter Brook. Two more voyage-of-discovery dramas are based on novels by J M G Le Clezio, Le Livre des Fuites and Pawana. And to end this survey of some of the main attractions, the Don Juan legend will be the theme of a ballet by Jean-Claude Gallotta to be danced by artists from the Centre choregraphique national de Grenoble.</p>

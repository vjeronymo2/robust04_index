			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / Halifax may enter rented sector Halifax, Britain's biggest mortgage lender, might be prepared to become a private landlord if the government offered financial incentives to encourage the rented sector, Mr Mike Blackburn, the society's chief executive, said yesterday. Mr Blackburn, addressing a Council of Mortgage Lenders conference in Edinburgh, accused the government of turning its back on the housing market. Tax allowances for homeowners and funding for social housing were being reduced simultaneously, reversing almost 50 years of postwar policy. He said: 'Households need further choice than simply between owning their homes and moving into socially rented accommodation. In other countries this is provided by private rented housing. In the UK this effectively does not exist.' Private rented housing had fallen to just 9 per cent of the UK housing market - 6 per cent in Scotland. Mr Blackburn said that while the 1988 Housing Act had 'swept away' most of the controls on renting that had been important factors in its decline without subsidy it remained financially unattractive. He said Halifax might consider entering the private rented market if it became more commercially attractive, 'possibly through the ownership of a company providing such accommodation'. He added: 'It would hopefully be profitable and further enhance our reserves. Most importantly it would help maintain our links with potential borrowers providing them with rented accommodation for the early years of their housing careers, before they take on a mortgage.' Halifax said it would favour tax allowances rather than grants. The society said that private renting could 'become an important new market for our commercial lending'. It added: 'We would like to see potential borrowers given more choice of tenure.'</p>

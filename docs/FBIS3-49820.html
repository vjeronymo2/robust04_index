			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with UN General Francis Briquemont by DER </F> SPIEGEL; place and date not given: "Threats Are Useless"]    [Text] [DER SPIEGEL] Mr. General, how is the situation in  Sarajevo?    [Briquemont] The military situation is very tense throughout  Bosnia-Herzegovina. While the diplomatic peace efforts  continue, all warring parties want to prove in the combat zones  that they are not in a weakened or inferior position.    I admire the people of Sarajevo: They are suffering, they  are starving, they are ill, but they do not lose their dignity.  Those who live here sometimes have the impression that the  people who have to bear the war and the political leaders who  caused it are worlds apart.    [DER SPIEGEL] At its Brussels summit, NATO again threatened  air strikes if Sarajevo and the Muslim enclaves continue to be  strangled. Do such announcements still terrify anybody?    [Briquemont] I am tired of having to listen again and again  to the talk about air strikes. The siege of cities like  Srebrenica, Gorazde, or Mostar cannot be broken by air strikes.  Those who do not know the local conditions had better refrain  from such demands.    [DER SPIEGEL] Would the UN troops and their humanitarian  help also be seriously endangered by NATO's military  intervention?    [Briquemont] I am always surprised when I am expected to  provide humanitarian help and promote the peace process inasmuch  as possible, while at the same time politicians consider the  threat of military force. One has to know what one wants. If  one decides in favor of war, the UN troops will not be able to  continue their humanitarian help under the circumstances. It is  simply impossible to keep three warring parties in check and, in  addition, help the civilian population with 8,000 blue helmets.    [DER SPIEGEL] That is to say, you would advise UN Secretary  General Butrus Butrus-Ghali against asking NATO for military  help?    [Briquemont] How can you hope to achieve a peace agreement  if you are threatening air strikes? After all, these strikes  are only supposed to be aimed against one side: Everyone wants  the Serbs to be given a thrashing. However, the problem is far  more complicated. We are dealing with a conflict on three  fronts; the idea taken from cowboy films, that is, that there  always has to be a good guy and a bad guy, does not fit in with  the inextricable Bosnian situation. The West cannot solve the  problems with a series of threats. Those who advocate military  force would have to accept the logic of war -- with all its  consequences.    [DER SPIEGEL] So far, the threats have not been very  credible. Would the hostile ethnic groups' preparedness for  peace increase if NATO were really determined to intervene with  massive force, if necessary?    [Briquemont] I am not sure whether this way of thinking is  understood by Muslims, Croats, and Serbs. Because of their  history, most of the people in former Yugoslavia are convinced  that they can only solve their problems with force. The idea of  solving conflicts by compromise, which is popular in the West,  has not yet been generally accepted here.    [DER SPIEGEL] Even the Muslims, who have always been  regarded as victims so far, do not seem to be prepared to give  in.    [Briquemont] The Muslims have changed a lot in the past few  months; they have become more belligerent. I was taken aback  when I heard a representative of Bosnian President Alija  Izetbegovic say: We will win this war. The Bosnian Army, which  was very weak when the fighting broke out, is meanwhile far  better organized and equipped.    [DER SPIEGEL] That is to say, you are of the opinion that  Muslims, Croats, and Serbs are equally to blame for the  continuation of the slaughter?    [Briquemont] At present, we could quickly come to an  agreement with the Serbs. They would only have to abandon some  of their conquered territories. Serbian leader Karadzic has  been basically prepared for it. At present, the worst fighting  is taking place between Croats and Muslims in central Bosnia. I  would have to have far more troops in order to be able to help  and mediate there. For we would have to be present in every  city and village; only in this way could the people's confidence  in the UN mission be gained.    [DER SPIEGEL] Is this confidence not irretrievably lost?  The Western crisis managers failed as early as when the first  symptoms of Yugoslavia's disintegration were shown.    [Briquemont] The greatest mistake was that the West was not  able to agree on a joint strategy and a joint objective right  from the beginning. There is a discrepancy between the  declarations of intent and the means that are provided for us,  the military, for the implementation of the political  resolutions on the spot. One did not know exactly what one  wanted, too many contradictory opinions were voiced. Successful  crisis management is not possible as long as the course is not  clear.    [DER SPIEGEL] Would it have been better to intervene early  with force, instead of helplessly watching the war spreading in  the Balkans?    [Briquemont] If one had decided in favor of military  intervention -- mind you, if -- all participating states would  have had to be aware of what that means for them.    [DER SPIEGEL] The West always flinched from these  consequences. The hands of the dispatched blue helmets are  tied. Thus far, about 70 UN soldiers have been killed by snipers.    [Briquemont] We are confronted with one of the dirtiest wars  where anything goes. Our blue helmets are in an extremely  difficult situation. But there is no intervention without risk.  If we participate in such a humanitarian operation, we will  have to expect casualties. Public opinion in the Western  countries reacts very sensitively to every loss. However, those  who send us here have to prepare themselves for tragedies.    [DER SPIEGEL] How could the safety of your soldiers from 22  countries be improved? Do you need more troops?    [Briquemont] Reinforcements of at least 7,500 men would be  necessary. Upon my request, the French and the Scandinavian  countries, too, immediately sent a battalion. That means:  Instead of 7,500, I got 2,000 additional soldiers. And then  the European countries pretend to be generous and ask us to  establish three additional land corridors in order to supply the  population. We would need at least four battalions, 4,000 men,  for this task alone. The United Nations is prepared to dispatch  sufficient troops after a peace agreement. This is wonderful,  but I would rather have these troops now, in order to be able to  fulfill my mission more effectively.    [DER SPIEGEL] Apparently, reinforcements will not come. Do  you think that the time when the blue helmets will completely  withdraw from Bosnia is near?    [Briquemont] If a peace agreement is not achieved by the end  of January, the responsible politicians will have to completely  reexamine our commitment in Bosnia. It is an illusion to  believe that the UN troops could continue their humanitarian  help indefinitely if the shooting goes on at the same time.    [DER SPIEGEL] For how long will you be able to hold out?    [Briquemont] Personally, I am of the opinion that in any  case we will have to stay until the end of the winter. It would  be irresponsible to let the civilian population down at this  time of the year. However, if the war flares up with new  violence in the spring, we will be confronted with the question  of whether we can afford to continue as before.    [DER SPIEGEL] You have already thrown in the towel as  commander in chief of the UN troops in Bosnia, you asked for  your replacement. Have you failed with your mission, which was  actually supposed to last until the end of July?    [Briquemont] Nobody comes here to gain glory and success.  He who hopes that is a fool. The only thing that we can  achieve is to mitigate the people's misery and curb the war. I  have done my best, this is only possible for a limited period.  At some point everybody is going to be worn out.    [DER SPIEGEL] Do you think that a one-year mission is too  long?    [Briquemont] UN bureaucracy conceived the duration of the  mission; it has nothing to do with the reality of Sarajevo. You  cannot imagine what frustrations and humiliations are connected  with this job. If one has gone through half a year, it is  better to pass on the baton to somebody else who can burden  himself with the same hardship with fresh energy.</p>

			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / Bankruptcies in Japan rise at record rate CORPORATE bankruptcies are rising at the fastest rate in Japanese history, according to a report published yesterday by a private research group which said bankruptcies rose by 32.1 per cent last year. The report by the Teikoku Data Bank shows that the number of bankruptcies has more than doubled from a low of 6,468 in 1990 to 14,167 last year. This is a faster rate of growth in the annual number of bankruptcies than at any point since the company started collecting statistics in 1965. The report's findings suggest that Japanese companies have become much more vulnerable to bankruptcy than they were in the 1970s. At the height of the first oil shock, bankruptcies rose from 7,140 in 1972 to 11,705 two years later. The last time bankruptcies rose strongly was in the early 1980s when they increased from 17,122 in 1982 to 20,841 two years later. However, in spite of the severity of the slowdown in the Japanese economy over the past two years the number of bankruptcies last year was still below the average annual rate in the 1980s of 15,891. The overall value of bankruptcies fell by 5 per cent to Y7,563bn (Pounds 38.8bn) last year reflecting the rise in failures among small businesses. Teikoku Data Bank said 48 per cent of bankruptcies were the result of the recession, up by 10 percentage points from last year. Real estate bankruptcies were 12.9 per cent up at 1,170. Bankruptcies in December were 9.5 per cent up from November at 1,454, which has a 20 per cent increase on December 1991, when there were 1,204 bankruptcies. One factor behind the rise in bankruptcies is the tougher approach which has been adopted among Japan's banks which are carrying a heavy burden of bad loans. The number of companies with which banks suspended trading last year grew by 18.3 per cent to 10,728 companies. These companies had debts of Y4,322bn, 2.9 per cent up from 1991, according to the Federation of Bankers' Associations. Last month an estimated 1,070 companies were suspended, up 3.5 per cent from the year before.</p>

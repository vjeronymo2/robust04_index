			<p>921109 FT  09 NOV 92 / Hurd faces grilling from EC over ratification MR DOUGLAS HURD, foreign secretary, today faces a grilling from his European Community partners anxious to establish when the British government intends to ratify the Maastricht treaty. Mr John Major's decision to delay ratification of the treaty until after a second Danish referendum next May caused consternation in European capitals, undermining hopes of a speedy approval of the treaty. Senior European officials remain unmollifed by subsequent suggestions by the UK government that it might proceed with a third reading of the Maastricht bill if Denmark postpones its referendum until later in the year. Mr Hurd is likely to stress at today's meeting of EC foreign ministers in Brussels that Mr Major's concession to Tory Euro-sceptics was necessary to avoid losing last Wednesday's vote in the House of Commons and thereby risk scuppering the Maastricht treaty. Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, the Danish foreign minister, will present Denmark's requests for exemptions from the Maastricht treaty, amid reservations among certain member states about Denmark's demands. The Danish question is rapidly shaping up as a battle of political wills within the EC, as some member states urge flexibility while others adopt a legalistic approach, warning that Denmark's demands for a UK-style opt-out on a single European currency and an exemption on a common European defence force amount to renegotiation of the treaty. UK ministers hope to secure a basic understanding on the Danish question at the EC summit in Edinburgh next month. But EC officials point out that the Edinburgh agenda is becoming crowded, particularly if there is no progress soon on the so-called Delors II package providing new funding for the poorer EC member states. In Brussels today, foreign ministers also face a heavy agenda. Mr Hurd will be urging his EC partners to support efforts to bridge the gap with the US on farm subsidies in order to reach a broader deal under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Efforts will be made to define the principle of subsidiarity - devolution of powers to the lowest appropriate level - and ministers will try to break the deadlock on the Delors II package. Last week, Mr Jacques Delors, European Commission president, revived his compromise idea of spreading the increase in EC spending from five to seven years, from 1997 to 1999. This would entail a freeze in the spending ceiling of 1.2 per cent of the Community's gross domestic product in the first two years, rising to 1.37 per cent of GDP in the next five years.

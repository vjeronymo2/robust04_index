			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Demand side management has become increasingly important to electric utilities as they seek ways to make their existing systems more efficient and reduce the need for new capacity. REA has supported demand side management (DSM) activities in the form of direct load control and energy conservation through loans for control equipment and principal deferment programs for energy conservation. With the passage of RELRA, REA is authorized to expand its role and make loans for all types of demand side management activities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This authority will be used primarily to finance distribution borrower needs. REA believes that most DSM activities must be conducted at the distribution level because DSM impacts the consumer's use of electricity. Power supply borrowers are eligible for this financing assistance, but the level of investment required to support their distribution members in this area is not normally expected to require loan funds. REA will not make DSM loans or any type of loans directly to individuals. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To be eligible for a loan for DSM programs, which include energy conservation programs (except those financed by loan principal deferments), and for on-grid renewable energy systems, the loan request must be supported by an REA-approved integrated resource plan (IRP). REA may also require an IRP, on a case by case basis, for certain large or unusual loans for off-grid renewable energy systems. DSM programs must also be supported by DSM plan, which must be consistent with the borrower's IRP. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As defined by the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;486) (EP Act), an integrated resource plan is ``a planning and selection process for new energy resources that evaluates the full range of alternatives, including new generation capacity, power purchases, energy conservation and efficiency, cogeneration and district heating and cooling applications, and renewable energy sources, in order to provide adequate and reliable service at the lowest system cost. The process shall take into account necessary features for system operation, such as diversity, reliability, dispatchability, and other factors of risk and shall take into account the ability to verify energy savings achieved through energy conservation and efficiency and the projected durability of such savings measured over time; and shall treat demand and supply side resources on a consistent and integrated basis.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the regulatory text, the term ``IRP'' is used to refer to the result of the process rather than the process. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EP Act also defines the term ``system cost'' to mean ``all direct and quantifiable net costs for an energy resource over its available life, including the cost of production, distribution, transportation, utilization, waste management, and environmental compliance.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This subpart establishes policies and requirements for IRPs and DSM plans. Many of these requirements are new, although existing &sect;&sect;1710.253 and 1710.254, and existing subparts E and G, set forth analytical and related requirements for the financing of most generation facilities that are the same in many respects to the requirements of an IRP. Given the expansion of REA lending authority in the relatively new and sometimes uncertain areas of DSM and renewable energy systems, it is essential that borrowers make their investment decisions based on an IRP in order to ensure informed and prudent investment planning. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If a distribution borrower is a member of a power supply borrower, its requests for DSM loans must be based on and be consistent with the IRP of the power supply borrower. The IRP of the power supply borrower will establish which DSM programs, on-grid renewable energy systems, and traditional utility investments, among several feasible alternatives, are most cost-beneficial from the standpoint of the power supply borrower and its members taken as an integrated system. The DSM programs of the individual distribution members must be coordinated among all parties to ensure that the DSM programs of one member do not jeopardize the financial integrity and loan security of any other member or that of the power supply borrower. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although DSM must be implemented at the distribution level, a significant portion of the benefits and costs of DSM are accrued at the power supply level. These benefits and costs are then transferred to the distribution borrower through wholesale rates. Consequently, DSM planning by distribution borrowers must consider the impacts of their activities on their power supplier and the implications of the power supplier's wholesale rates. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because of the relationship between a power supply borrower and its members and the relationship among the members of a power supply borrower, it is imperative that the power supply borrower and its members coordinate IRP activities per &sect;1710.356(b)(1) of this interim rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If a distribution borrower is not a member of a power supply borrower, loan requests for DSM programs and on-grid renewable energy systems must be supported by the borrower's own IRP. The IRP must address, in particular, any effects its DSM programs will have on the wholesale power rates charged by its non-REA financed power supplier. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The requirements set forth for DSM plans and IRPs are intended to provide guidance as these new requirements are implemented. Since these areas are new in many respects, REA intends to exercise its discretion to administer the specific requirements and procedures with a prudent degree of flexibility, especially during the first several months of implementation. Comments from the public are invited regarding the policies and requirements set forth herein for DSM plans and IRPs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This rule includes citations to studies of the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) and the U.S. Department of Energy which are included as reader aids and do not imply REA adoption or endorsement of said studies. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This interim regulation will define DSM and renewable energy systems. It will also emphasize REA commitment to finance nontraditional (renewables, DSM and energy conservation systems) and traditional resources on an equal footing. Borrowers requesting loans under this subpart will be required to submit an IRP and a DSM plan in most cases. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Loans under this subsection for facilities to be owned and operated by the borrower will generally be treated like loans for usual electric facilities. Loans for other purposes will be considered as operational loans with terms based on the borrower's program cycle. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Until REA has developed experience in making loans for these new purposes, cumulative loans for DSM and for energy conservation programs will be limited to an amount not to exceed 20 percent of the borrower's equity. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 1710 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] In the past, progress in environmental protection  was achieved overwhelmingly by applying technological measures  downstream, as in the case of filter, washing, and sorption  systems for dedusting and exhaust gas cleaning, clarification  methods for treating effluent, and biological, chemical, and  thermal plants for treating waste. Successful though the use of  these downstream treatment methods may be, the future of  environmental engineering lies in preventive measures that avoid  the occurrence of pollution from the outset. The new  "Production-Integrated Environment Protection" funding program  will support the development of industrial production methods  that contribute to the avoidance of pollution at source, to the  cyclic economy, and to resource conservation.    The development and introduction of new production processes  entails considerable expense and risk because radical changes in  the production process are required without detriment to the  quality of the end product. This is why industry is slow to  adopt preventive technologies. Remedial measures still account  for about 80 percent of environmental protection investment.  However, it must be borne in mind that those who avoid  environmental pollution today by adopting integrated environment  protection technology, conserve resources by closing circuits,  and recycle products that have outlived their usefulness will  save on the expense of pollution disposal tomorrow. A whole  series of pioneering solutions already available shows that  ecological issues can be fully reconciled with economic  considerations.    Firms in the new federal laender have special opportunities  for converting industrial production methods to take account of  the environment, as the technologies of the future should be  installed there from the outset to replace obsolete technologies  and defunct markets. The process of building up new production  capacities should take account of the principles of  production-integrated environment protection for economic and  ecological reasons, as this is where the decisive market  advantages will lie in the long term.    The "Production-Integrated Environment Protection" funding  program is primarily directed at processes and products  involving low-degradability or nondegradable substances or  blends of substances. It seeks an integrated approach taking in  the whole production process from raw material extraction to the  treatment of unavoidable residues:    -- Environment- and resource-conserving extraction of raw  materials from the biosphere;    -- Environment-friendly, low-waste and emission production  processes achieved by replacing polluting raw and process  materials, modifying the process technology, and closing the  entire process circuit;    -- Maximum recycling of production residues and reuse in  other production processes (networking of production processes);    -- Environment-compatible product design making for  environment-friendly use, maintenance, and recycling or  reprocessing, and    -- Return to the biosphere of residues that cannot be  recycled in an environment-compatible form achievable by  pretreatment.    Production process conversion will be backed up by  ecobalances and product line analyses. The systematic closing  of material circuits is expected to bring economic advantages as  well. Product-integrated environment protection thus means the  conservation of both economic and ecological resources.    An annual appropriation of about 25 million German marks  will  be available for the implementation of the  "Production-Integrated Environment Protection" funding program  during the initial phase. A substantial increase in funding for  this increasingly important area of environment protection  research is expected in subsequent years.</p>

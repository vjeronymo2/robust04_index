He added that the objective within  public finances is to maintain a balanced budget and that the  devaluation rate will not be changed.    De Posadas told the Viewpoints radio program, aired by  Montevideo Radio El Espectador: "We want a zero deficit and I  believe we will not miss it by much."    As far as prices are concerned, De Posadas stated:  "Inflation  has been falling, it will stand at 2 percent (...) in February.  This means inflation is on its way down and I believe the trend  will continue."    De Posadas added: "There are no plans to change the exchange  rate guidelines" because "the economic program calls for  maintaining the present devaluation rate."    De Posadas admitted that a recent review of economic targets  with IMF experts "has led to upward and downward corrections,"  adding that General Taxation Department and Social Security Bank  revenue expectations "had been very pessimistic, but reality is  showing that revenues are much higher than our typically  Uruguayan pessimism had led us to expect."    Asked about the trade deficit, he answered: "A trade deficit  is not necessarily bad, just as a surplus is not necessarily  good."    He said: "Traditional exports continue to grow, which is  very  important. Whenever one looks at national figures one must look  at them as a whole. Uruguay is receiving a lot of capital which  is not registered because of errors and omissions. This capital  is used mainly for investment and consumption."    De Posadas added: "It would seem that the upward trend of  the  deficit changed in December, although one swallow does not make  a summer." [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / People: Wellman recruits out of the furnace Wellman, the specialist engineering group, announced five senior appointments yesterday as part of a reorganisation following the Pounds 46m acquisition of three businesses from FKI, the electrical engineering and components concern. Two external appointments have been made. Andrew Carnegie takes over as md of Wellman Robey, which makes industrial boilers and pressure vessels. He was formerly md of a competitor, NEI Cochran. Don Lupton has been appointed operations director of Wellman Furnaces. He too was previously at a competitor, Davy Priest Furnaces. Three internal promotions to md have also been announced - Alan Phillips at the Wellman Data Recording Group, Craig Pilkington at Wellman Garage Equipment, and Jim Wright at Wellman Service Group. Carnegie has replaced Ken Homans, who is retiring, but the other posts are new. They are the first stage in a planned post-takeover reorganisation at West Midlands-based Wellman, says chief executive Alan Baxter. Baxter was a former main board director at FKI, joined Wellman last November, and first approached FKI with the acquisition proposal. The deal was completed in August, and has increased Wellman's annual turnover from Pounds 25m to about Pounds 125m.</p>

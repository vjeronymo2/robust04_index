			<p><P> November 2, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> EDISON GETS BIG QUARTER, BIG VICTORY;  </P> <P> SUNSET LEAGUE: CHARGERS SCORE 20 IN SECOND QUARTER AND BEAT OCEAN VIEW, 23-17,  TO WIN LEAGUE TITLE WITH UNDEFEATED RECORD.  </P> <P> Though they mounted most of their serious drives only in the second quarter,  Edison High School held on to defeat Ocean View, 23-17, Thursday night in front  of 3,400 at Huntington Beach High.  </P> <P> Edison (8-1, 6-0 in the Sunset League), got three touchdown passes by senior  quarterback Josh Gingrich and scored 20 points in the second quarter.  </P> <P> Ocean View dropped to 4-2-1, 2-2-1. The Seahawks' hopes for a playoff berth  rest, in part, on the outcome of their game against Huntington Beach next  Friday.  </P> <P> "We've got to beat Huntington," Ocean View Coach Howard Isom said. Edison has  completed its league season.  </P> <P> Edison got another strong performance from Gingrich, who completed 18 of 25  passes for 268 yards. He entered the game with 1,643 yards passing and 12  touchdowns.  </P> <P> The 6-foot, 190-pound quarterback got Edison's offense rolling during the  Chargers' second possession of the second quarter, when he connected with wide  receiver Mike Cunningham on a 51-yard pass play with 7 minutes 3 seconds  remaining in the half.  </P> <P> Six minutes later, Gingrich, rolling out to his right and under heavy pursuit  by at least two Ocean View defenders, teamed with Cunningham on a 10-yard pass  play for a touchdown.  </P> <P> Gingrich and the Chargers then gained possession at their 20-yard line with  1:04 left before the half and drove 80 yards for another score.  </P> <P> The key plays in the drive were a 40-yard reception by wide receiver Ryan  Blanchard, who tipped the ball away from two defenders to make the catch, and a  24-yard run by junior tailback Travis Balding that moved the ball to the Ocean  View 16. From there, Gingrich hit junior tight end Rod Lippincott on a crossing  pattern for a 20-3 halftime lead.  </P> <P> Ocean View, which had opened the scoring on a 42-yard field goal by Ron  Lightner on its first possession of the game, cut the Edison lead to 20-10 in  the third quarter on a 75-yard run by quarterback Randy Karliner.  </P> <P> After Lightner's field goal in the fourth quarter, Ocean View scored its final  points on a four-yard run by fullback Matt Barry with 49 seconds left.  </P></p>

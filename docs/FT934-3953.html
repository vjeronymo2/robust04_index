			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / Guidelines issued on hotel valuations Hotels should be more consistently valued under professional guidelines issued yesterday by the British Association of Hotel Accountants. The guidelines come shortly after revelations that valuations by two firms earlier this year on the 1992 assets of Queens Moat House had diverged by nearly Pounds 500m. They are the result of two years' work by the technical committee of the association, which will form part of best practice but is unlikely to be given any mandatory status. Under the new guidance property valuation should relate to recent and current performance - and particularly future trading potential, based on cash flow projection. Valuers should normally use a discounted cash flow technique to simulate anticipated receipts, payments and operating performance of a hotel, which is then capitalised. Information on sale prices of other hotels should only be used as a benchmark. Separately, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors and the Accounting Standards Board are considering new valuation guidelines. The guidelines say hotels should normally be given an open market value for their existing use. The guidelines express concern at the volatility of hotel valuations, which have sometimes not been supported by the earnings achieved. Recommended practice for the valuation of hotels. British Association of Hotel Accountants, 193 Trinity Rd, London SW17 7HN. Pounds 25</p>

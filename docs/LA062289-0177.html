			<p><P> June 22, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> USDA DISCOVERS MOTH REPELLENT IN FUNGUS  </P> <P> Government scientists have identified an extract from a soil fungus that  protects wool clothes from moths and beetles longer than mothballs and doesn't  leave an odor, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.  </P> <P> Roy Bry, an entomologist with the department's Agricultural Research Service,  said the wool protectant could probably be developed as an aerosol spray.  </P> <P> And, while moth balls are usually effective for about a year, fabrics treated  with the soil fungus extract five years ago continue to repel moths, the  department said.  </P> <P> The protectant is derived from avermectin, an anti-parasitic agent produced by  a soil fungus.  </P> <P> Bry said he has conducted tests on the three worst enemies of wool fabric --  the furniture carpet beetle, webbing clothes moth and black carpet beetle --  and found that the fungus extract either killed or repelled larvae, even after  washings and dry cleanings.  </P> <P> Avermectin was developed by Merck &amp; Co of Rahway, N.J., to prevent internal  parasites in animals.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Cambodian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Message" from His Majesty King Sihanouk in Beijing General </F> Hospital; date not given -- recorded]    [Text] Beloved brothers, children, grandchildren, and great  grandchildren; venerable monks headed by the Supreme Patriarchs  Pouthiveang and Khousananda, wisemen, and nuns:    I would like to address this message to all of you. I would  like all of you to know that I think about and love you very  much. I do hope that on the occasion of our traditional New  Year in April, I will be able to come back to be with you as  before and to work together in order to build and defend the  country in an atmosphere of mutual love, mutual trust, and  mutual care as brothers in our great Cambodian family.    I was very happy to receive the delegation, with Samdech  Chea  Sim as its chairman and His Excellency [H.E.] Heng Samrin as its  deputy chairman, which just visited me (?on behalf of) the  nation and people. I and the queen miss our motherland and all  our children, grandchildren, and great grandchildren very much.    I would like to take this opportunity to inform you that the  great Chinese friends have given me the best help. They have  given our Cambodia, me and my family, and our people great  friendship and genuine fraternity since time immemorial, now,  and in the future. Moreover, this cancer treatment has been  successful thanks to their efforts in scientific, technical,  material, and all other fields. They have worked very  meticulously and flawlessly, giving me good care (?so that) I  will live longer to serve our Cambodian motherland. [Words  indistinct] they said it would be completed (?this month). The  reaction was good, there has been no difficulty. Many patients  who are much younger than I am have suffered a bad effect after  the third and fourth stages of the treatment because the  medicine for curing cancer is very strong. This strong medicine  causes the patient to lose strength, experience nausea, and have  a headache or other bad effects. The great Chinese friends,  however, have sought special Chinese traditional medicine for  me. These doctors have tried to find medicine for dealing with  this disease according to each step of its condition. Moreover,  they have bought modern medicine from abroad, such as the newly  developed American drugs, to cure me as soon as possible so that  I can return to our motherland.    It is expected that I will be able to return home in April,  the month that we mark our traditional new year. Only two more  phases of treatment are needed, that is, the fifth and sixth  phases. After the sixth phase, there will be a recess of nearly  a month in order to check results. After that, it seems that I  will be allowed to leave.    (?In conclusion), I would like to tell you that I am quite  concerned about some problems facing you, brothers, children,  grandchildren, and great grandchildren. I have read our  national newspapers, which my son-in-law, (Keo Put-reaksmei),  sends me every week. Therefore, I have learned about all the  big, medium, and small problems facing you. I would like to  share all the woes you are facing. I always share your weal and  woe and as our saying goes: Always share weal and woe together.  My heart and soul always stay close to Cambodia, to all  children and grandchildren, and to all venerables.    Samdech Chea Sim, our National Assembly chairman who is the  acting head of state when I am not in the Kingdom of Cambodia,  and H.E. Heng Samrin have made reports to me [words indistinct].  I would like to commend all patriotic children and  grandchildren for always having good intentions toward our  motherland, for bravely and patiently enduring all the  shortcomings, and for working hard with all your strength and  wisdom to serve the motherland and the livelihood of your  families. This makes all of you worthy of being citizens of our  independent and sovereign kingdom.    I would like to tell you that I am satisfied with your  decision to serve the rights and freedoms of our children and  grandchildren in line with our Constitution; that is, our  people's rights as the masters of our land, water [words  indistinct]. Children and grandchildren (?have the) rights and  freedoms [words indistinct] use policy of nonviolence. This  means that there should be no quarrels, arguments, nor danger to  the nation. The only question of violence is that with the  Khmer Rouge, who have not yet understood that nonviolent policy.  Except for the Khmer Rouge, our entire nation understands the  need to use nonviolent methods -- that is, peaceful means -- in  all circumstances. Therefore, I (?hope that) all children will  be able to avoid serious disaster by using peaceful means and  they will follow the appeal I made in various messages. [Words  indistinct] with our National Assembly, government, various  ministries and departments, and our soldiers. This is because  they belong to all children and grandchildren, to all Cambodian  people. Whether they are called the royal government or  whatever, they are your government, the Cambodian people's  government. The government is called the royal government  because our country is a kingdom. So, the word royal is added  to everything just as in some countries like England.    This does not mean that the government serves only the  king. It primarily serves the people. This is because the  people own the vote and the power. Therefore, all children and  grandchildren [words indistinct] peaceful means. I support you  so long as it is a peaceful one. Demonstrations are a normal  happening. It is [words indistinct]. In a liberal democratic  system, demonstrations are regarded as ordinary happenings.  Therefore, I support all of you in this undertaking so long as  there is no (?violence), no bloodshed, no injury. All of this  is no good. But your voicing opinions and asking for this and  that are just ordinary things. They are good undertakings to  arouse our government, our National Assembly, and our  administration -- both civilian and military -- to always pay  attention to you and your problems.    Concerning National Assembly members, [words indistinct]  salaries, there will be problems. I know that there will be  such problems. I told [words indistinct]. Now what I said was  true [laughter]. Problems have taken place. Therefore, in my  opinion, this matter must be resolved according to the majority  of National Assembly members as well as the majority of citizens  -- what do they want it to be; how do they want it to be? Do  listen to them. As with the doctors who are giving me the  treatment [words indistinct]. Therefore, I dare not say how  much, to what extent should their salaries, their earnings, be.  All I want to tell you is that you should listen to (?the  majority). [Words indistinct] teachers, nurses, medics,  professors, and (?youths) also have similar problem. Therefore,  a cordial discussion, cordial contacts between our people and  our National Assembly, our government, and the various  ministries is a good thing. I would like all children and  grandchildren to continue such contacts.    That is all the information I have for you. I pray to the  Lord Buddha's Triple Gems to please protect the Supreme  Patriarchs, patriarchs, venerable monks, brothers, children,  grandchildren, and great grandchildren. May all of you always  be blessed with longevity, social prestige, happiness, strength,  and enlightenment. Thank you.    (?This is my message) to the compatriots through Samdech  Chea  Sim, H.E. Heng Samrin, and all excellencies in the delegation.</p>

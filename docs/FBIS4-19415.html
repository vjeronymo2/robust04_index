			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The Serbs have again stepped up pressure in  Bosnia: They have surrounded two UN installations near Sarajevo.  Among those besieged, are some 30 French blue helmets. [passage  omitted]    In Paris, Defense Minister Francois Leotard repeated his  firm  line. He spoke to Frederic Carbonne:    [Begin Leotard recording] We cannot accept this totally  shocking attitude, which consists in attacking the United  Nations through its UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force]  representatives. It is not France that is being attacked in  these actions, it is UNPROFOR. In other words, it is the UN  Security Council resolutions, and we cannot accept that.    We are soldiers of peace, and our first concern is to be  impartial in this conflict. We cannot accept this, and we have  said so. This is the reason for our presence on the ground, and  this is the reason behind the recent allied strikes against Serb  targets. There will be others if such practices continue. We  cannot, alas, rule anything out. We are very careful to keep up  our role as a buffer force but, of course, there is a new  tension. It is up to the diplomats and the soldiers on the  ground to try to defuse that tension. We are not there to wage  war on one of the parties, even though we see that one of them  is today behaving in quite a shocking manner. [end recording]</p>

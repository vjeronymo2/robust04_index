			<p>920609 FT  09 JUN 92 / Czechs lead Slovakia in the economic stakes: High unemployment has fuelled resentment among Slovaks against Prague BEFORE last weekend's elections Mr Vaclav Klaus, Czechoslovakia's federal finance minister, said his ambition was to become the first leader in post-communist Europe to win an election while most of the electorate was still suffering from economic reforms. That ambition was realised in the Czech lands as more than 30 per cent of the electorate voted for the man who abolished subsidies, freed prices and reduced their real incomes by up to 20 per cent over the last 18 months. It was a huge personal victory for the didactic former economics professor who suffers fools badly and makes few concessions to opponents. His support reflects belief that sacrifices would pay off in the medium term. They have already produced benefits such as an internally convertible currency, liberalised imports and the start of a mass privatisation programme. This will make 8.5m Czechs and Slovaks small shareholders in more than 4,000 state-owned enterprises. If the programme is successful it could be adopted as a model by other post-communist countries, including Poland and Russia. The latest statistics also indicate that the unprecedented 29 per cent decline in industrial production since January 1990 bottomed out in the last quarter of 1991. Output is now starting to rise. The official statistics furthermore still largely ignore the private industrial sector where output has been growing for months, fuelled by rising foreign investment and start-up operations by local entrepreneurs. At the same time, inflation dropped from 58 per cent last year, largely caused by the reduction of subsidies, to an annual rate of around 10 per cent in April. Real wages and savings are also rising again, both in the Czech lands and Slovakia, according to Mr Karel Dyba, the Czech economics minister. Exports are also rising strongly after a 30 per cent decline in volumes between 1989 and 1991. This, and the growing inflow of foreign equity capital, has allowed Czechoslovakia to reduce its net foreign debt from Dollars 9.4bn (Pounds 5.2bn) last year to Dollars 9.1bn at the end of the first quarter of 1992. Voters in Slovakia, however, do not share the faith of the Czechs that the recovery is just around the corner. Unemployment has risen from nil to 12 per cent over the last 18 months, three times the official rate in the Czech lands. In the large Czech cities like Prague, however, employers cannot fill vacancies, specially for skilled workers and office staff. High unemployment has fuelled the resentment expressed in support for Slovak nationalist and separatist parties in the elections. The worst hit areas are one-industry towns like Martin in central Slovakia, where more than 10,000 workers once had jobs making Soviet-designed tanks, mainly for export. The outgoing federal government in Prague, staffed largely by idealists who played a key role in the November 1989 'velvet revolution', ordered sharp cuts in output and imposed tight export controls on defence equipment, leaving thousands unemployed. Mr Klaus is expected to relax these restrictions which merely led to former Czechoslovak arms markets being taken over by US and other arms exporters. Despite the association agreement signed with the European Community last year, however, Slovak attempts to follow the more westerly Czechs into EC markets are proving difficult. Kosice steel works, near the Ukrainian border, managed to sell cheap steel wires and coils to France, Greece and other markets in recent months. However, this only provoked protests and threats of anti-dumping duties from Eurofer,the European steel producers' association. Meanwhile, unemployment could rise sharply once the mass privatisation programme finally puts state enterprises into private ownership. It is only at that point that the new owners are expected to exercise their proprietorial rights by cutting bloated payrolls and closing loss making plants. The main question now is whether the strong support for economic reforms shown by Czech voters will lead to the expected sharp increase in foreign investment. With labour costs only 10 per cent of those in western Germany, western and northern Bohemia in particular are being targeted as prime sites for producing low-cost exports to EC markets. US investment bankers advising the Czech government estimate that projects worth an estimated Dollars 5bn are in the pipeline as Czechoslovakia gears up to overtake Hungary as the prime target for foreign investors. How much of this investment flows on to Slovakia will be influenced by the outcome of negotiations on the future of the Czech and Slovak federation. But most US investors in particular expect to make their first investments at least in the Czech lands, which are close to the EC markets, rather than more distant Slovakia, says Mr Mart Bakal of Crimson Capital Corporation, investment bankers to the Czech Ministry of Privatisation.</p>

			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / Survey of Morocco (9): Acts of faith in Western Sahara - Francis Ghiles finds that the Moroccan government is determined to keep the territory ON THE edge of the small fishing port of Dakhla, 1,000 kilometres from Rabat, the Moroccan capital, a small block of flats stands empty. According to local officials, it awaits the return of the 'lost brothers', those Saharaouis who, since Morocco took over the Western Sahara 18 years ago, chose to flee to camps in south-western Algeria and fight King Hassan's claim to the former Spanish colony. The dispute is still far from being settled despite 10 years of intermittent fighting and a UN peace plan launched just over two years ago. Progress on the plan has been stalled by disagreement between the Moroccans and the Polisario Front, which has been fighting for an independent Western Sahara and over who would be entitled to vote on the future of the territory. On the ground, however, everything has been done to ensure that the Moroccans stay. True figures of investment are not available but a visit to the capital of the territory, Laayoune, and to Dakhla, to the south, underlines the extent of Morocco's determination. Laayoune, which in 1975 boasted a governor's residence, a traditional Spanish parador style hotel, a brothel and thousands of shacks for the natives - indeed it was more reminiscent of the wild west than anything else  -has been turned into a bustling town of over 130,000 people, thronged at lunchtime and in the late afternoon with children going to and from school. A new airport has been built, while a new and slightly vulgar hotel has been added to the parador, where the availability of peanut butter at breakfast is a sure way of detecting the Canadian and American members of the Minurso (United Nations Mission for Peace in Western Sahara), whose headquarters lie just below the parador. UN marked aircraft at Laayoune and Dakhla airports also remind the visitor of the dispute, as does the fact that his passport is checked on arrival and departure for domestic flights. Unofficial estimates of investment in roads, hospitals, schools, water ducts and other civilian projects are put at between Dh20bn and Dh30bn. Even these figures, however, are underestimates as soldiers are often used, at no cost to the state. To those Saharaoui town dwellers who chose to remain and pay allegiance to the Moroccan crown were added the nomads who, in the late 1970s, were driven to the towns by the severe drought endured by the Sahel region of Africa. Despite Moroccan government efforts to help such people reconstitute their camel herds, the nomadic way of life is, here as elsewhere, a victim of modern political and social evolution. The effort to spread literacy and ensure a minimum of health is impressive. A second hospital is about to open in Laayoune, and the province itself boasts a further four. Each has 220 beds. Four smaller health centres exist in Laayoune alone. Medicine and all consultations and operations are free in the Western Sahara. Laayoune's hospitals appear well run, staffed by well-trained Saharaoui doctors and Moroccans from the north. The 900 children who went to school in Spanish days have become 32,000 today. Laayoune boasts 27 primary schools, five lycees and a teachers' training college. The authorities say that 90 per cent of those in age to attend school in Laayoune do. Spanish has been forsaken as a foreign language to be replaced by French and, increasingly, English. No foreign teachers, however, have yet been allowed to practise in the territory. Dakhla, which is now twinned with Rambouillet near Paris, has been virtually built from scratch. The pasha of Dakhla, the genial Si Mohamed Fadhel Semlali, points to a few remaining Spanish buildings, including an ugly 1950s style Catholic church still inhabited by an old Spaniard who has apparently decided he is going to die in the place, around which he said that about 90 Saharaoui families lived back in 1975. Dakhla was taken over by Mauritania then and handed over to Morocco in August 1978. The town now has 30,000 inhabitants and sits near the tip of a 40-kilometre-long tongue of sand between the rolling Atlantic waves and a deep laguna. It feels like the back of beyond but boasts one asset which, were the status of the Western Sahara to be finally settled, could be of great importance: some of the richest fishing grounds in the world. Indeed, the oddest sight in Dakhla is that of two Japanese visitors. Japanese, Korean, Russian and Spanish vessels fish offshore, some legally, others not. The prize here is squid, a great favourite with Asian consumers. In Dakhla itself a few small plants, such as Fishgod, set up by a Mr Salem Amghayer in 1989 operate, but the absence of a fully equipped port means that most of the fish or squid caught offshore is treated in Agadir or Tan Tan, much further north on the Moroccan coast, in the Canary Islands which lie offshore or on the ships themselves. How much people who have traditionally been nomadic and turned their back on the sea can be turned into fishermen and businessmen remains to be proved. Fishing could also provide a basis for tourist activity, though to date there is little of that other than passengers transiting through Laayoune to and from the Canary Islands and northern Morocco. The Dakhla laguna, its beaches and the opportunities for serious fishing might well attract an international hotel group. However, such an outcome appears unlikely so long as the dispute continues. The authorities in Dakhla have built a four-star hotel but for some reason have done so in the middle of the town, away from the beach and in such a tight location that the compound boasts no garden, no large swimming pool and no seashore to step out to. No wonder they are finding it difficult to find a company willing to manage such an establishment which otherwise is soberly decorated and built to high standards. Dakhla has also to do a lot to ensure running water in most homes. The town is lucky as it sits on a large underground aquifer of sweet water. On the other side of the laguna the king has set up a farm where fruit, including winter melons, and vegetables are grown using state-of-the-art irrigation technology. Much of the produce is exported to France. The rich phosphate deposits at Bu Craa, 70 miles inland from Laayoune, are still exploited and the rock treated at a plant outside Laayoune before being exported but the depressed state of the market currently makes such wealth of little importance in providing new jobs. The considerable resources that Morocco has poured into developing the Western Saharan provinces - whose population includes Saharaouis and many northern Moroccans who can earn tax-free salaries while working there - constitutes an act of faith. Traditional ties of allegiance between the Moroccan sultans and tribal chieftains have been buttressed by Rabat's continuous efforts to reinforce its physical presence and win the hearts and pockets of the Saharaouis. Whatever their innermost feelings might be, they have been offered more in terms of health, education and general well-being than many of their northern brethren.</p>

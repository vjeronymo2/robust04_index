			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Utility worries Utility stocks moved against a strong market trend after Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, stressed Labour party plans for a windfall tax on the privatised water and electricity companies. Norweb closed 4 lower at 812p and Midlands Electricity surrendered 8 to 780p. Yorkshire Electricity softened 3 to 740p, although Northern Ireland Electricity contrasted by finishing 6 stronger at 375p on talk of a break-through in the framework for peace talks in Northern Ireland. Among water shares, Thames retreated 7 to 503p and Anglian, which reported figures earlier this week, gave up 10 at 524p. Southern was 8 lower at 589p, while Northumbrian slipped 8 to 696p ahead of today's interim figures. Mr Nigel Hawkins at Hoare Govett said the reaction of the stocks to the speech 'serves to remind investors of the political risks attached to utility stocks'. Commercial Union was restrained by market caution following third-quarter results. The profits of Pounds 305m were near the top of the range of forecasts, but Credit Lyonnais Laing said it showed that CU's rate of improvement had slowed and some analysts argued that the 20 per cent premium of the share price to net asset value was too high. The shares closed unchanged at 543p, while Royal Insurance, reporting today, firmed 2 to 300p and General Accident eased 2 to 581p. Cable and Wireless shed 7 to 392p in turnover of 13m as analysts moved rapidly to downgrade profits forecasts following a disappointingly weak interim performance from the group's Mercury arm. The group as a whole turned in half-time growth of 11 per cent but Mercury, hit by price competition from BT and regulatory pressure on revenues, saw operating profits slide 3 per cent. NatWest Securities promptly chopped its annual profits estimate for C&amp;W by Pounds 90m to Pounds 1.1bn, and anecdotal evidence suggests that some other houses took an even more cautious line. BT, which unveils interims today, and Vodafone were clear beneficiaries of some heavy switching out of C&amp;W, with the former up 8 1/2 to 393p on 8.1m shares traded and Vodafone gaining 6 at 211p. High street retailer Boots retreated 4 to 516p, with Smith New Court reported to have turned negative on the stock and been the day's main seller of the shares. A story doing the rounds suggested that Boots had rejected an offer for its pharmaceuticals division of DM2.5bn from BASF, the German chemicals group, because it did not want the company to be relocated away from its Nottingham headquarters. High street clearing bank Barclays moved up 9 to 598p as it confirmed that it was in negotiations with the New England bank Shawmut National over the sale of its US subsidiary Barclays Business Credit. Press reports have suggested the sale could reap between Dollars 200m and Dollars 400m. Furniture group MFI, 4 1/2 higher at 137p, responded to a strong recommendation and upgrade from Morgan Stanley. The broker raised its current year profits forecast by Pounds 5m to Pounds 97m. Marks and Spencer stayed weak following Tuesday's cautious comments from the company surrounding the release of interim results. The shares eased 2 1/2 to 401 1/2 p. Hopes of a shake-up in UK gaming laws, hinted at by the Home Secretary, led to demand for several stocks. Ladbroke, which publishes its third-quarter trading update today, firmed 4 to 153p and Rank Organisation 10 to 403p. Also better on the same speculation was London Clubs, which added 8 at 261p. The world's biggest glassmaker, Pilkington, receded 4 to 188p, with a sizeable line of stock said to be overhanging the market. International trading conglomerate Lonrho had another hectic day, with 3.9m shares traded and the stock gaining a further penny at 152 1/2 p. Since the announced departure of joint chief executive Mr Tiny Rowland, the shares have put on 15 per cent and some brokers now feel uneasy with a prospective p/e ratio approaching 30. NatWest Securities is one of the more sanguine houses, estimating break-up net asset value at 175p. Amersham International slid 63 to 928p as analysts reduced forecasts in the wake of disappointing interims. The range of full-year estimates came back to between Pounds 47m and Pounds 50m. Campari International recovered 4 to 25p as it was announced that a company known as Blueridge Ltd had acquired almost 11 per cent of the leisure and sportswear group. Campari was trying to establish last night who was behind Blueridge and whether the stake had been acquired for investment purposes or prior to a bid approach. Other statistics, Page 45</p>

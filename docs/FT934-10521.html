			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / Wave of terrorism reflects deepening crisis in Turkey THE attacks on Turkish targets in Europe yesterday reflect the increasingly desperate measures being taken by Kurdish militants to draw attention to their cause. They also coincide with an unprecedented wave of violence in Turkey's Kurdish speaking south-east region. In the last 10 days, more than 130 people have been killed, of whom 77 were civilians from pro-government villages, allegedly murdered by the Kurdish Workers Party (PKK). The deepening crisis has already forced the prime minister Mrs Tansu Ciller to reshuffle her cabinet, and diplomats believe the latest incidents will force her to cede further powers to the military in fighting the PKK. 'These outrages show once again that the PKK is a terrorist organisation and that governments in Europe must now curb its activities,' the foreign ministry said. The Turkish right wing was already calling for punitive measures, ahead of next week's key parliamentary debate on extension of emergency rule in the 13 south-eastern provinces. The government has been trying to win cross-party support for the new draconian provisions of the anti-terrorism law. But it may fail in the absence of a clear national policy on the Kurds. Mrs Ciller's own party is concerned that the military may use its extended powers to impose martial law in the region, with the government appearing to have given up the pretence of normal civilian rule in the region. Ankara already has an estimated 150,000 troops in the area, and is preparing to send 7,000 special forces in early December. Last week, the government announced the cancellation of all public works in the region, after reports that contractors were being forced to pay protection money to the PKK. Basic services such as primary schools have become targets, with television carrying gruesome footage of six young teachers murdered last week, apparently by the PKK. More than 700 schools in the Diyarbakir area alone are now closed. Meanwhile, local officials are arming Turkish villagers, in the wake of bloody attacks by the PKK.</p>

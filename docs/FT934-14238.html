			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / Bonn refuses to respect EC cereals limit in E Germany THE BONN government is refusing to abide by European Community limits on the amount of land which can be sown with cereals in eastern Germany, threatening a bruising row between Germany and the EC at a meeting of agriculture ministers today. A senior Commission official said Bonn's militancy on agriculture threatened to unravel the Common Agricultural Policy reform, break budgetary limits Bonn is constantly urging on Brussels, and further complicate General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade talks already on the brink over the farm issue. The dispute was ignited because the east German Lander, or states, have exceeded by nearly 10 per cent the area they are entitled to plant. Under last year's reform of the CAP, which introduced big price cuts and production restraints to rein in oversupply, budgetary outlays, and to try to make possible a Gatt farm trade agreement, the former east Germany was given a 'base area' eligible for EC price support of 3.6m hectares. This has been overshot by 347,000 hectares. The Commission, interpreting the rules flexibly to take account of the prostration of the eastern German economy, on Friday proposed a gradual phasing in of the automatic penalties for exceeding the planted area. Brussels proposes that instead of facing a 10 per cent reduction in aid next year, the normal penalty for cultivating 10 per cent too much land, an immediate reduction of only 1 per cent will be imposed. As for the excess land, the Commission says 10 per cent must be taken out of production next year, 20 per cent in 1995, 50 per cent in 1996 and 100 per cent in 1997. The Commission's concession will cost an extra Ecu85m (Pounds 66m) to an Ecu36bn farm budget already in danger of exceeding its legal ceiling. Germany responded on Friday by saying it would not respect this compromise, and would compensate its farmers for any penalties from national funds. Bonn says the original calculation of the 'base area' in east Germany, made by Brussels in 1992, was incorrect, by failing to include some 180,000 hectares of land devoted to maize. Mr Jochen Borchert, the German agriculture minister, said Brussels had failed to allow for the upheaval in east German agriculture. Far more land was taken out of use for livestock production than had been forecast, and the land was switched to cereal production, which was unexpected. 'The very survival of many farms in east Germany will be at stake,' he said. Although Chancellor Helmut Kohl has written to Commission president Mr Jacques Delors defending Germany's case, Brussels regards this posture as an infraction of EC law. If the dispute is not resolved, legal action could result, and the Commission says it will claw back any illicit German aid at the end-of-year clearing of accounts.

			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Family values take on Lou Grant - Karen Zagor on the background to Pat Robertson's bid for TVS THE REV Pat Robertson, the US televangelist, and Lou Grant, the liberal journalist of the eponymous television series, would make strange bedfellows. But TVS Entertainment, which will lose its independent television franchise for southern England at the end of this year, looks likely to bring them together. If the Pounds 38m bid for TVS from Mr Robertson's US-based International Family Entertainment succeeds, he will control his first overseas television company. And UK viewers will have access to the wholesome family-oriented programming that has made IFE successful in the US. Mr Robertson has been scouting the market for ways to expand his broadcasting business, according to Mr Christopher Dixon, an analyst at PaineWebber. TVS appeared to be a good opportunity. For IFE, one of the most attractive aspects of TVS is MTM, its US production company, with a library that includes Hill Street Blues and Lou Grant. Such shows may not be to Mr Robertson's personal tastes but he has an uncanny ability to tap into the American consciousness. His 700 Club talk show, launched in 1960 and still going strong, inspired a host of other televangelists. And the Family Channel, with its stated dedication to family-oriented programming, hit the airwaves three years before Mr Ronald Reagan was first elected president and more than a decade before 'family values' became the theme of this year's presidential election. Mr Robertson, who controls IFE with his son Timothy, was one of the few leading televangelists to emerge from the 1980s with his reputation unsullied by fraud or sexual misconduct. Since April, when IFE's public stock offering left observers marvelling at his ability to transform a Dollars 183,000 (Pounds 107,000) investment into stock valued at flotation at about Dollars 90m, he has come in for an unprecedented amount of scrutiny. Mr Robertson started the Family Channel in 1977, as a branch of his Christian Broadcasting Network, financed largely with donations from viewers. By the late 1980s, the Family Channel was so successful it had started to threaten Christian Broadcasting's non-profit status. In 1989 the Robertsons incorporated IFE with Tele-Communications, the world's biggest cable television business, as a minority investor. Tele-Communications makes an interesting bedfellow for International Family. Its alleged strong-arm tactics have led Senator Albert Gore to dub the company the 'ringleader' of the 'cable Cosa Nostra'. The Robertsons invested Dollars 150,000 in the new company, buying 4.5m shares at 3.33 cents each, later buying another tranche for about 2.22 cents. Although the Robertsons' convertible shares in IFE account for only 6m of the of the 36.2m shares in issue, their voting power adds up to 60 per cent, thanks to their ownership of Class A shares which carry ten votes per share. The common stock carries one vote per share. In 1990 the Family Channel was sold to IFE in a deal worth Dollars 250m. The deal left Christian Broadcasting with about 4.8m shares in IFE. A university founded by Mr Robertson holds another 9m shares, while 10m shares are held by the public. The Robertsons have profited handsomely. Although the stock has recently fallen to about Dollars 11 1/2 from Dollars 15 at the time of the initial public offering, it is unlikely to plunge as far as the few cents the Robertsons originally paid, barring disaster. Meanwhile, the Family Channel goes from strength to strength, attracting almost as many viewers as the MTV rock video channel. Last year, it earned net profits of about Dollars 19.8m on revenues of almost Dollars 113.7m, against profits of Dollars 14.4m on revenues of Dollars 93.4m a year earlier. Looking to the UK, IFE expects to make a version of the Family Channel available on cable systems. UK viewers may not, however, be treated to the Mr Robertson's 700 Club performance on IFE channels. The publicly-held IFE is careful to stress its independence from the Christian Broadcasting Network. The Family Channel's programming is distinctly secular, including shows such as The Waltons and Father Knows Best. Should Mr Robertson choose to use the UK Family Channel for his 700 Club, he would have to buy air time like any other broadcaster.</p>

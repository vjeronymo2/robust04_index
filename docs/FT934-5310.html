			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / Survey of Vietnam (3): Resources lie thin on the ground - Banking The elegant facades of the commercial bank buildings in Ho Chi Minh City and the imposing exterior of the State Bank of Vietnam (SBV) in Hanoi provide the veneer every banking system requires: stability, respectability and wealth. But it is not an image that springs to mind for most Vietnamese. Under the former Communist command economy, individuals were unable to hold bank accounts. Neither were private companies, as the concept of a private company was not tolerated. Individuals and private businessmen either transferred their wealth into durables, such as gold, kept it in cash or deposited it with unauthorised, and often unscrupulous, financial businesses. Transforming the banking sector so that it can sustain and facilitate a market economy is among the most daunting of the government's tasks. The first step has been to hive off the separate lending divisions of the SBV into four state-owned commercial banks - the Industrial and Commercial Bank, the Vietnam Bank for Agriculture, the Foreign Trade Bank and the Bank for Investment and Development. The SBV, therefore, now acts as a central bank, in charge of the sector's supervision and as facilitator of the government's monetary policy. Ten foreign banks have been licenced to open branches, two joint ventures between foreign and domestic state-owned banks established and more than 20 'shareholding' banks created. The latter have a mixed ownership of state and private companies, co-operatives and individuals. Although most shareholding banks are majority owned by state institutions, businessmen regard them as private banks carrying no sovereign guarantee in the event of failure. While private companies and individuals may now hold accounts, a director of a shareholding bank sounds a note of caution. 'The banking system still isn't up to the development of the economy. It's the main obstacle,' he says. Vietnam lacks a sufficiently wide branch network and bankers have yet to win the confidence of individuals and businesses. The scepticism of potential customers is justifiable, notes one local banker, who says banks face difficulties in performing the most basic transaction - allowing customers to withdraw cash. The fault, he explains, lies in the government's policy of using physical cash as the main tool of its monetary policy. As a result, when the government wants to dampen inflationary pressure, it does so principally by reducing cash in circulation, leading to a paucity of notes. Understandably, many of the banks' customers demand a guarantee that payments made through the banking system can be withdrawn in cash. This can only be guaranteed by passing the transaction through the SBV which has the sole authority to issue 'cash-cheques'. But the SBV will not issue a cash-cheque unless the bank from which the money is being transferred delivers to the SBV the payment in physical notes. 'Sometimes, we cannot understand the way the State Bank (of Vietnam) does business,' complains one local banker. A former financial adviser to the government believes senior SBV officials, in spite of recent bank reforms, remain ignorant of how banks operate in a free-market economy. His advice for further reform, given with a wistful smile, is, 'Pull out the governor (of the SBV) . . . He doesn't know banking'. Although other bankers point to the excellent record at controlling inflation of Cao Si Kiem, SBV governor, severe inadequacies in the sector need to be confronted. The four state-owned banks, which at the end of 1992 had 36,000bn dong in assets, are burdened with non-performing loans and are poorly capitalised. Donor officials say the proportion of the state-owned banks' non-performing loans has fallen from about 30 per cent of their portfolios in 1990 to about 12 per cent, after a concerted government drive to make state corporations current on loans, by selling assets if necessary. But local bankers point out that the accounts of state-owned banks and enterprises are poor. More non-performing debt may come to light. The banks' capitalisation is no better. A recent World Bank report estimated the state-owned banks' capital levels at less than 1 per cent of assets. The banks would require an injection of Dollars 250m to bring them up to international capital adequacy standards, and a higher figure if they plan to increase lending. Economic liberalisation should go hand-in-hand with a relatively fast expansion of domestic bank credit but Vietnamese banks lack the basic skills for the task. A recent World Bank report notes: 'There is as yet no loan classification system - neither in most of the individual banks (with the notable exception of the foreign and joint venture banks), nor even in the thinking of the regulatory authorities'. One step would be for foreign banks to fill the void until the domestic banks' skill levels have been improved. However, 'there is an aversion among the foreign bankers to lend locally,' says an Asian banker. Foreign banks prefer 'to pick off the short-term stuff, the trade finance,' says a European banker. He says foreign banks would be willing to lend more to domestic business but the legal system allowing recovery of bad loans is inadequate. The high tax structure for banks - a turnover tax of 4-15 per cent and a profits tax of 50 per cent of net income - also makes them wary of long-term, higher risk lending. Banks are encouraged to hold 30 per cent of deposits with the SBV at negligible or zero interest rates which, being well below the banks' average cost of funds, constitutes a further tax. As a result, banks operate on the thinnest of margins. The agenda, therefore, for those seeking to reform the banking system is over-flowing. Given its staff's lack of experience, the SBV faces a stiff challenge to restructure the sector to keep pace with the rest of the economy. The scale of the task 'scares the hell out of them (the SBV),' says one foreign banker. 'They know they're short on resources'.</p>

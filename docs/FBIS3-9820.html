			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Branko Peric: "Mark Brothers"] </F>   [Text] The top government leadership of the Srpska republic  was alarmed in early January by the emergence of a special form  of war profiteering: large-scale trade with the enemy. Data of  the security services indicated that prohibited trade had been  taking place for quite some time at 26 points along the "lines  of contact," mainly with the Muslim army. Military experts  estimated that this phenomenon is a "form of planned special  warfare" and that it could seriously threaten the country's  defense capability.    On 18 January 1994, the president of the state formed a  state  commission headed by Major General Bogdan Subotic to interdict  this phenomenon "by all available means." The chairman of the  state commission has formed a staff of the best-known experts  from Public Security and Military Security, inspectorates, and  judicial bodies, and he chose for the operation known as "Border  94" Teslic Opstina, in which the border with the Muslim army is  about 120 km long, and where trade with the enemy has assumed  "disturbing proportions."    The knowledge gained by the state commission has astonished  everyone. In Vucja Planina an open-air market where several  hundred people gathered has "operated" daily right alongside the  trenches. Serbian and Muslim soldiers, Serbian and Muslim  civilians, were buying and selling. Everything was being sold,  just like at the ordinary open-air market. The Serbs even hauled  goods to the Muslim trenches in trucks. The Muslims were being  sold artillery shells and even mortars. The Serbs in Teslic who  live in daily fear of shelling, who have come to the town from  the direction of Tesanj, cannot believe that the Serbian  soldiers are selling those same shells to the Muslims.  <H5>  The Fund </H5>   During the operation, which lasted a month in Teslic, goods  intended for prohibited trade were confiscated in the amount of  990,000 German marks [DM]. Cash derived from prohibited trade  amounting to DM337,698, 42,870 Austrian schillings, 18,000 Swiss  francs, and $3,250 was confiscated from individuals. Inspections  by the inspectorate shut down 35 private firms and independent  shops. Twenty-three legal entities inspected were found not to  have paid state tax on time in the amount of DM3,403,427. With  the interest accrued, the tax obligation of those debtors  amounts to DM9,655,000. Criminal and misdemeanor charges were  filed against 422 persons, and 49 persons were detained.  Criminal charges were also filed against the opstina president,  the former chairman of the Executive Committee, the chief of the  public security station, and several enterprise managers.    The business being done by the wartime suppliers runs into  millions of marks ending up in the pockets of individuals. Along  the lengthy chain of middlemen, the earnings are beyond the  dreams of ordinary mortals. DM250,000 were found buried in the  vicinity of the house of someone living near the demarcation  line on Vucja Planina.    Among the mysterious stories circulating in Teslic, the most  interesting one is about the flight of two Muslim soldiers taken  prisoner as they were carrying on trade along the line. These  two prisoners disappeared one night from the detention  facilities of the military police in Teslic, and the manner of  their escape and who is to blame for it has not been ascertained  to this day. There is suspicion that they were released so that  they would not expose those with whom they were trading or that  they themselves were traded in a good bit of business.    The state commission obtained much more important knowledge  in its study of the operation of opstina authorities and  commercial firms. It was found that the opstina had its own fund  of foreign exchange, referred to as the war fund, which by  opstina decision was receiving the income tax on individuals  working abroad in the amount of DM300 per month and DM50 for  individuals working in republics of the former SFRY [Socialist  Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]. According to the republic  statute, this tax has been uniformly set for the entire republic  at DM200 and is a revenue of the state itself.    Not only did the opstina authority not respect the republic  statute, but it evaded all the rules of business finance in the  way it handled the money collected. No decision was made on  establishment of the fund, no rules were established on  conducting its affairs, nor were management authorities  elected.... The funds were handled by the opstina president, the  chairman of the Executive Committee, the secretary of the  Secretariat for the Economy, and the chief accountant: by word  of mouth, in writing, over the telephone, however it suited  them. Money was given to individuals, who signed a receipt that  was thrown away when the money was repaid. DM5 million were  spent from the "war fund" in slightly more than a year and a  half.  <H5>  The List </H5>   The funds were used by government-owned and private  commercial firms, institutions, government bodies, and  individuals.... Individuals carried some of the foreign exchange  in briefcases to Belgrade where they exchanged it in private  currency exchanges at an exchange rate known only to themselves.  The people and the government can only guess as to their honesty  and integrity. It is sufficient to know that the merchants  carried to Serbia hundreds of thousands of marks to buy flour,  sugar, oil, and other goods, while at the same time inflation  was rendering worthless the immense claims of the Teslic economy  in Serbia. Anyone who risked suspicion knew why he did so.    An examination of the financial and accounting documents of  commercial firms revealed all the shortcomings of current  legislation and all the resourcefulness of dishonest merchants.  Imported goods are accompanied by one set of documents to the  border, another set from the border to the destination, and then  it is all shredded. Bills of lading are even used made out to  customers who have nothing at all to do with the goods ordered  except being located in the same town. Thus, there are cases,  according to the documentation, when the business of certain  firms has increased slightly over the previous year, although  everyone knows that trade has been flourishing. Given this way  of doing business and taxes made worthless by inflation, it is  clear how individuals have acquired immense wealth in a short  time through trade.    While the state commission is writing up criminal charges  and  making a list of illegalities and irregularities committed in  the presence and with the blessing of the authorities, the  opstina committee of the SDS [Serbian Democratic Party] is  writing up a list of enterprise managers and government  officials who are not members of the party and on whose  trustworthiness members of the SDS opstina committee are to take  a position. Of the 32 enterprise directors and officials on the  list, only eight are members of the party. The rest are to be  removed, but it is not clear who will do this and how. One thing  is certain: The new uniformity of thought is turning the  proclaimed democracy into dictatorship, and all the rest is  familiar territory.  <H5>  The Remedy </H5>   Members of the staff of the operation "Border 94" in Teslic  are concluding on the basis of that operation's results that the  pattern in Teslic reflects that in the entire republic. For a  well-meaning observer of local conditions, the logical  conclusion cannot be avoided that the present chaotic situation  is the result of the wrong policy by the wrong people. How  otherwise to explain the fact that criminal charges have been  filed against the most responsible individuals in the opstina  government? How is one to explain the fact that opstina  authorities have done nothing to thwart and prevent goods from  reaching the front line?    Gen. Subotic declared war on criminals in a press conference  which he held in the Culture Center in Banja Luka on 25  February, and that same evening on the program "Open Screen"  over Banja Luka television. Viewers gave him credit and offered  him support, but did not fail to ask him when he would get  around to other cities and when the people would finally learn  who the culprits were in the affair of the "Golfs."    The general was self-confident and made a public promise  that  the commission would take its work to the end and that the time  would come ultimately when the culprits in the well-known  scandal of the "Golfs" would be made public. It remains to be  seen whether the general was caught by an embarrassing question  or the time of truth has really come. Quite a few people are  doubtful about the success of the general's campaign. By and  large, the people have stood by the general, and his failure  could signify defeat of a policy.</p>

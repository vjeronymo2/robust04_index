			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / Red Army Faction ends its war The Red Army Faction (RAF), Germany's much-feared urban terrorist group, claimed yesterday it was giving up violence in its 20-year-old war on the west German establishment. 'We have decided to withdraw from the escalation. That means we will now stop attacks on leading representatives of business and state,' the RAF said in a letter delivered to the Bonn office of the French news agency, Agence France-Presse. The offer of peace came just over a year after an RAF sniper shot dead Mr Detlev Rohwedder, president of the Treuhand privatisation agency, through a window at his home in Dusseldorf. In July 1990, Mr Hans Neusel, responsible for security in the interior ministry, narrowly escaped a bomb attack. A year earlier, Mr Alfred Herrhausen, chief executive of Deutsche Bank, was killed by a car bomb on his way to work. The letter, which officials said bore the hallmarks of earlier 'official' communications, added that the RAF felt it necessary to think over where it had gone wrong. Violence had weakened rather than strengthened its political support. Mr Klaus Kinkel, justice minister, said it was 'heartening and hopeful that the RAF for the first time wants to turn away from violence'. The government was ready for reconciliation within certain constraints. It is not certain, however, that the authorities would be prepared to go as far as freeing imprisoned members of the RAF, as demanded in the letter. The note warned that violence would resume if the state 'does not allow us, fighting for a humane society, to live'. Security officials were guarded in their response, since there was no way of knowing if the letter represented the views of all members of the organisation. The RAF, committed to an 'armed struggle against imperialism' and mobilising the masses for revolution, is a shadowy extreme left-wing movement modelled on Latin American urban guerrilla groups. Rooted in the Baader-Meinhoff group, formed after the student revolts of the late 1960s, its philosophies seem to have lost any appeal they might have had to youth disenchanted with the capitalist system. During the late 1980s, several members decided to leave the group and went to the former East Germany, helped by the Stasi security police. They have since been returned to the west German authorities.</p>

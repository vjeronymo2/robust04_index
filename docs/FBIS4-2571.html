			<p>BFN     [Text] Shanghai, March 8 (XINHUA) -- Oscar Faber TPA Ltd.  of Britain will provide a draft traffic plan for the central  business district of Shanghai by the end of June, according to a  contract signed here today.    The central business district of Shanghai covers the  17-square kilometer Lujiazui on the eastern bank of the Huangpu  River and the bund on the western bank of the river. It will  become the busiest district in Shanghai, with a population of  more than 200,000 and a floating population of 500,000. The  situation has put a strict demand on the arrangements of  communications network.    To guarantee quality of the plan, Shanghai Municipal  Government decided to seek advice from professional foreign  firms. Oscar Faber TPA Ltd. beat five well-known traffic  planning agencies from Britain, Japan and the United States, to  win the contract.</p>

			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / Advisers warn Bonn on eastern strategy A REPORT from the German government's council of economic advisers has indirectly criticised Bonn's more interventionist strategy towards east Germany and warned that 'overhasty actions' in response to the depressed mood in the east will hinder economic recovery. It also criticised the Treuhand's new priority of restructuring. 'Supporting unprofitable jobs will merely hold up economic reconstruction,' the report said. The council predicted unemployment of 1.7m in east Germany this year. The IFO economic institute has estimated that east Germany needs investment of DM211bn by the end of the decade to acquire the same quality of environment as west Germany. However, it appears the preference for building new nuclear power plants in east Germany, partly on clean air grounds, is now being reconsidered by the government. Mr Jurgen Mollemann, economics minister, is now seeking a consensus with the anti-nuclear opposition Social Democrats on energy matters.</p>

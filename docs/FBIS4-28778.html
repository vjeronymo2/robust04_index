			<p>BFN     [Text] ASEAN Free Trade Area [AFTA] members should speed up  the reduction of taxes to below 5 percent on products that have  potential to attract foreign investment in the region, according  to Suwan Phasuksawat, deputy director-general of the Fiscal  Policy Office.    While AFTA participants have agreed to reduce taxes on many  products to between zero and 5 percent within periods ranging  from eight to 15 years, the reductions should be expedited in  some cases, he said.    Mr Suwan headed the Thai delegation at the ASEAN senior  officials' meeting in Indonesia on June 3 and 4. Besides  discussing tariff cuts, participants also reviewed measures that  are considered non-tariff barriers under the framework of the  General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.    Under the AFTA framework, non-tariff barriers will have to  be  scrapped within the next five years.</p>

			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / Survey of World Car Industry (20): Facing the truth / Profile of Yoshifumi Tsuji, Nissan's president MR YOSHIFUMI TSUJI was billed as a straight-talking factory hand when he was appointed president of Nissan Motor, Japan's second biggest vehicle maker, in June. He has since lost no time burnishing the image, writes Steven Butler. Just two months after he took the wheel, Nissan announced in late August that it would slip into the red in the year to March, posting a Y20bn loss. The open admission of a financial loss is never easy for a Japanese company, and often is something that can be disguised by accounting gimmickry. Mr Tsuji's decision to admit Nissan's difficulties openly has let in a gust of fresh air, and left him in a stronger position to try to turn the company around. Yet this will not be an easy task, as Nissan's difficulties appear to be deepening almost by the month. September's car sales in Japan were bad for the industry, falling by 4.4 per cent year-on-year. Yet Nissan's sales were abysmal, falling by 19.3 per cent. While one month's statistics do not establish a trend, nine months do. Nissan sales were off by 9.6 per cent to 1.03m units in the year to September, compared with an industry-wide decline of 5.7 per cent. This has pushed down Nissan's share of the market by one percentage point to 22.8 per cent. If Nissan continues to lose market share at home, the forecast of a Y20bn loss for the year could prove optimistic. The reasons for Nissan's loss of market share are fairly straightforward. The company has not caught up with the trend toward recreational vehicles that helped Mitsubishi Motors boost sales by nearly 9 per cent in August. Unlike Toyota, Nissan has recently had a dearth of new model cars to inspire its customers. Even so, Nissan's poor sales performance seems surprising given the huge and in the main successful efforts by the company to remake the company's image and win new customers. Under the leadership of Mr Yutaka Kume, then president now chairman, Nissan established a design trend in 1987 with its smash hit Cima luxury sedan. This was the first move by Japanese car designers toward rounded lines, nostalgic body shapes drawn from earlier decades, and experiments with radically new concepts. Yet where Nissan led, its smaller and nimble competitors, Mazda, Mitsubishi, and Honda, followed with great success. Nissan is stuck in the middle. It sells a full range of cars to meet almost every need, but at half the size of Toyota it cannot match Toyota's economies of scale. It has also never had Toyota's knack for super-efficient factory management. When in earlier decades Nissan tried to match Toyota's strategy of selling relatively safe, dull designs to mainstream customers, it saw its market share decline steadily from about 30 per cent to 23 per cent. At the same time, Nissan is enough in the dull mainstream of the market to risk losing customers should its designs appear too radical. And the customers attracted by Nissan's more radical designs are easily won over by the bolder attempts of other makers. As a result Mr Kume's strategy of stressing design and going for market share appears to have fallen flat. Worse, Mr Kume left Nissan with a heavy burden of net debt, amounting to Y3,568bn at the end of March, or 147 per cent of equity. Mr Tsuji's strategy to cope with this has been to go back to basics and to try to improve productivity by 10 per cent a year on the factory floor. The problem, as he sees it, is that Nissan cars are just too complex, and they need to be engineered for simplicity. Nissan has also decided to cut directors salaries and to reduce hiring so that the size of the staff will fall gradually by 4,000, or 6 per cent in the next three years. Beyond this, the strategy is just to hang on. Nissan's profits should begin to recover in a year or two as the heavy burden of depreciation costs, resulting from the company's ambitious investment programme, begins to ease. Nissan considered cutting capacity but decided this would prevent it from enjoying a surge in profits when the market eventually recovers. Even now, Nissan is just 60,000 vehicles sales away from the break even point. There is, therefore, a light at the end of the tunnel for Nissan. The difficulty is that the light is moveable, depending on how long it takes for the market to recover. The danger for Nissan is that a slow recovery could force it to take more drastic measures.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------             JAPAN CAR SECTORS' PERCENTAGE SHARE OF NEW SALES  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                         6-months 1992   6-months 1991   6-months 1990  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- STANDARD (2001cc      and over)                16.1          11.1            7.7 SMALL (661 - 2000cc)          65.9          70.9           77.7 MICRO (660cc and under)       18.1          18.0           14.6  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: JAMA  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

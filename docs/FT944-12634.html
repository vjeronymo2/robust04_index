			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / Speedy growth in money supply causes concern The narrow measure of the money supply last month grew at its fastest annual rate since January 1989, causing increased concern about inflation and the prospect for further increases in interest rates. M0 rose by a seasonally adjusted 7.3 per cent in the 12 months to October and by 0.5 per cent over the month, according to figures released by the Bank of England yesterday. The less volatile notes and coins component grew 0.4 per cent between September and October and 7.1 per cent over the 12 months. In both cases seasonal adjustment factors were entirely responsible for the monthly rise. In unadjusted terms M0 and notes and coins were unchanged between September and October. Nevertheless, the Bank of England, which issues its latest inflation report today, is likely to be concerned at the continued strength of M0, which remains stubbornly above its monitoring range of between zero and 4 per cent. In its August inflation report the Bank said: 'If M0 growth remains at its present rate throughout the rest of the year, concerns over future inflation would increase.' At that time the annual growth rate of M0 was 6.5 per cent, lower than its current level. The report noted that 'in the past, increases in the growth of M0 have tended to lead to increases in inflation'. M0, which includes banks' operational deposits as well as notes and coins, is seen as a rough guide to activity in the high street, since higher consumer spending is linked with the need for more cash. But some have explained the recent strength of M0 by pointing to low interest rates, which have reduced the effective cost of holding cash. In contrast to M0's strength the broad measure of money supply growth - M4 - has remained close to the lower end of its monitoring range of between 3 per cent and 9 per cent. This leads some monetarist economists to argue that there is little immediate danger of inflation. The growth rate of M0 is likely to be a discussion point when Mr Eddie George, the governor of the Bank of England, meets Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor of the exchequer, tomorrow. Some analysts expect the governor to press for an increase in base rates.</p>

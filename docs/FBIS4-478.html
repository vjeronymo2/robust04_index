			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Micel Schnehage] </F>   [Text] Johannesburg Apr 10 SAPA -- African National  Congress President Nelson Mandela said he would seek another  meeting with Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini next week despite the  king's rejection of proposals to accommodate a Zulu monarchy  after the April election.    Addressing supporters at a rally to commemorate the SA  [South  African] Communist Party [SACP] Secretary General Chris Hani at  Orlando Stadium in Soweto on Sunday [10 April], Mr Mandela said  the Zulu king had been offered a status higher than the one he  currently enjoyed under the present kwaZulu constitution.    Mr Mandela said after King Goodwill had rejected the  proposals put forward at an emergency leadership summit at the  Kruger National Park on Friday, he had approached the Zulu  monarch and asked him "do you want the same rights enjoyed by  (Britain's) Queen Elizabeth?"    He claimed the question had not been answered by King  Goodwill.    Turning to the security issue in kwaZulu/Natal, Mr Mandela  said the ANC fully supported the state of emergency implemented  on March 31 to restore stability in that province and to ensure  a free and fair election in the region.    Mr Mandela appealed to the masses to support police and  South  African Defence Force [SADF] actions in that region who "have a  difficult task to ensure all people are disarmed". He said the  purpose of security forces deployed in the province was to  protect life and property and to ensure a free and fair election  was conducted in the area.    Mr Mandela said security operations had to continue under  the  current political climate in kwaZulu/Natal and appealed to the  SADF and SA Police to "behave in a manner which will allow us to  rely on them". He stressed the need for confidence in these  forces who in the past had not enjoyed the support of the people  because of senior members' involvement in violence and  corruption.    The ANC leader accused State President F W de Klerk of  complicity in the violence in that region because of the  involvement of the so- called third force in fomenting the  violence. "De Klerk is part of the massacres in that region",  he told a wildly cheering crowd of about 8,000 supporters.    He urged the crowd to recommit themselves to peace and to  end  "finger-pointing" accusations for the violence in the country.  "Each one of us must take responsibility to end crime and  violence", he said.    In further criticising Mr de Klerk and his National Party  [NP], Mr Mandela said although recent election polls had  indicated the ANC had lost support to the NP and the Democratic  Party he again referred to the NP as a "mouse". "We are dealing  with a mouse, the NP is a mouse and they think they can fight  the ANC, an elephant". "If a mouse overfeeds it will gain  weight, but it will remain a mouse" he told the cheering crowd.    He noted that many South Africans were gravely concerned  about the future of the country which was going "through a  difficult time" and urged all South Africans to re-commit  themselves to peace.    Mr Mandela discouraged supporters from carrying weapons and  said "neither we the ANC and the IFP should carry unlicensed  weapons to prevent the killing of innocent people" and to ensure  a free and fair election.    Refer6ing to slain SACP secretary general who was gunned  down  by assassin Janusz Walus in his Dawn Park, Boksburg, home on  April 10 last year, Mr Mandela said Mr Hani was a "true patriot"  who died preaching peace.    Mr Mandela told supporters the greatest tribute they could  pay to Chris Hani's memory was to elect a democratic government  in South Africa to provide "a better life for all". He said Mr  Hani had died an untimely death but not in vain. Mr Hani, he  said, stood for peace, democracy and justice which also  underlined the ANC's policy.    Two shots rang out as the rally ended but no incidents were  reported in Soweto west of Johannesburg during the gathering.    A police spotter plane and helicopter monitored the rally  from above and a small SADF contingent presence was maintained  directly outside the stadium. Security arrangements with the  security forces had been discussed ahead of the rally to ensure  it ran without incident.</p>

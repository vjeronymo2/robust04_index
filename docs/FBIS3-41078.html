			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Camilo Chaparro; first paragraph is EL TIEMPO </F> introduction]    [Text] In 12,000 early sentencing hearings, the  prosecutor's office has sentenced nearly 9,000 people. Of those  investigated, 60 percent were charged with crimes related to  drug trafficking, terrorism, and kidnapping.    The Office of the Prosecutor General has developed legal  procedures for the early termination of criminal proceedings and  penalty negotiations, and in this way has put an end to crimes  going unpunished and delays in nearly 9,000 investigations.    In just 18 months the Office of the Prosecutor General has  held approximately 12,000 special early verdict hearings and has  sentenced almost 9,000 accused persons.    According to Deputy Prosecutor General Francisco Jose  Sintura, the use of penalty negotiations is increasing, and is  having a direct impact on unclogging the judicial backlog and  preventing crimes from going unpunished.    Sintura told EL TIEMPO that even though most of the  negotiations (60 percent of the hearings) were held for persons  charged with crimes in the jurisdiction of regional or special  prosecutors, the use of early verdict hearings is rising for  ordinary crimes.    "Of the 12,000 early verdict hearings the Office of the  Prosecutor General has held, most are related to crimes handled  by regional judicial officials--drug trafficking, extortion,  terrorism, homicide for the purposes of terrorism, and  kidnapping--but we are also beginning to see a significant  increase in the negotiation of penalties for ordinary crimes  like petty theft, personal injuries, embezzlement, etc."    Only 30 percent of the 12,000 settlements of negotiated  penalties reached in the last 18 months by regional or special  prosecutors and sectional or ordinary prosecutors have been  overturned by judges.    Sintura stated that negotiated settlements are rejected  basically because of judges being overly legalistic. "For  example, there are cases," he said, "in which a judge annuls a  settlement reached between the accused and the prosecutor's  office because a member of our staff forgot to list the penalty  of a fine, which in any event is clearly stipulated in the law."    Sintura admits, though, that on other occasions prosecutors  have made mistakes that lead judges to annul the settlements.  "In some cases they do not properly support the charges, or they  poorly describe the crime or seek inappropriate penalties," he  added.    The deputy prosecutor general believes that with last  November's reform of the Criminal Procedures Code, negotiated  penalties are going to increase considerably, for now they will  be easier to use.    "With these new amendments," said Sintura, "this type of  settlement will be reached directly between the accused and the  prosecutor. After the hearing a document will be sent to the  judge so the judge can verify its legality. That will make the  negotiations smoother, as the judge's intervention will not be  as direct."    According to Sintura, the early verdict procedure has  enabled  society to convict a number of criminals against whom the state  had no evidence.  <H5>  The Ochoas and Urdinola </H5>   Of the 12,000 hearings held by the Office of the Prosecutor  General, the deputy prosecutor's office has handled the eight  most sensitive cases. Sintura conducted the sentence negotiation  procedures with Ivan Urdinola Grajales, Gonzalo Mejia Sanin,  Fabio and Jorge Luis Ochoa Vasquez, and some others as well.    "In some of these cases we had no solid evidence, and if not  for the criminals' confession, which grants them some benefits,  it would not have been possible to win a conviction," said the  official.    "This office has conducted eight early verdict hearings. The  most difficult to date was Urdinola's case, as we knew that the  automatic sentence reductions provided by the law would not let  us put him away for many years, and second, because the evidence  we had against this man was quite rudimentary," added Sintura.    Sintura says that the sentence of four years and seven  months  (the actual time) that Urdinola has to serve was "essentially  based on his own confession and on some documents U.S. officials  provided. If we had taken this case to court without his  confession, we could not have gotten a verdict."    He explained that a negotiated penalty also offers the  prosecutor's office the advantage of the possibility of  conducting other investigations against persons with whom  penalties are being or have been negotiated.    "We conduct very specific negotiations with very  well-circumscribed charges so that we can pursue other  investigations; for example, Jorge Luis and Fabio Ochoa  confessed to cocaine trafficking between 1974 and 1990."    "If the prosecutor's office demonstrates that between 1991  and 1993 they distributed more cocaine, we can bring another  case against them that has nothing to do with the negotiated  penalty," says Sintura.    "In Urdinola's case," he added, "charges and penalties were  arranged for drug trafficking, and he was told that a homicide  charge against him was not included in this negotiation."    "He obviously always wanted the homicide charge to be  included in the negotiation. But the position of the Office of  the Prosecutor General was clear: homicide charges were not  negotiable unless he made a confession; as he did not confess to  the homicide charges and claimed to be innocent, we are now  moving forward with that case," said the deputy prosecutor  general.</p>

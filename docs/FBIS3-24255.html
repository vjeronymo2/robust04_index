However, this does not mean that there are no  politicians who ascribe a paramount role to the content of the  message. An analysis of the "compatibility" of the positions of  the president and parliament, conducted by Sergey Glazyev in an  interview with NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA, is an example of this.    Glazyev not only comes to interesting conclusions, but  he also shares some of the optimism of the president's  message--not in an assessment of the economic situation, but in  Boris Yeltsin's arrangement of priorities and in the spirit of  the message, which, in his opinion, makes it possible to hope  for constructive cooperation (the chairman of a Duma committee  thinks that the most important priorities are the conduct of an  active structural policy, the stimulation of the formation of  financial-industrial groups, a mechanism for real control over  state property and the creation of institutions of social  partnership, and reform of the tax system).    The president's message on economic policy priorities that  was presented last week to the Federal Assembly is very close to  the recommendations that were developed by the economic policy  committee in parliamentary hearings on 10 February, believes  Sergey Glazyev. Although, in his words, there are several rather  serious differences between the position of the president and  parliament.    In particular, there is a serious difference in the  assessment of the current state of the economy. The president is  far more optimistic. "One of the main theses of the message  which relates to the economy states that we have moved away from  the edge of the abyss. As for our conclusions, which we made on  the basis of materials of the government and independent  experts, for us it is evident that we have entered into a state  of catastrophe. Perhaps the situation in society obliges the  president to come out with optimistic positions."    One other difference, according to Glazyev, is the need to  depart from stereotypes in explaining the economic difficulties  as a fight between the supporters and opponents of reform. "The  hearings in the State Duma have shown that there is no kind of  `class struggle' around the most important directions of  economic policy."    However, Sergey Glazyev thinks that it is much more fruitful  to examine the "positive" theses of the report, which propose  specific measures for the resolution of problems and not only an  assessment of today's situation.    For example, the report sets the near-term task of  developing  a law that clearly establishes the rules of functioning of state  organs, first and foremost of the executive authority. But the  Duma is also seriously troubled today by the absence of any kind  of responsibility for the management of state property. "The  committee for the management of state property is engaged in  everything but the administration of state property--in fact,  tasks for the effective administration of state property have  generally dropped out of the spheres of interest of the  government. The main task is considered to be the distribution  of state property, regardless of whether it is effective or not  and whether it is economically justified. State property does  not bring incomes, and even its privatization in 1993 and 1994  gives a figure that is surprisingly close to zero. In addition,  the state, instead of receiving incomes from its property,  increases the tax burden, suppressing economic growth and the  private sector, for the sake of which, by the way, privatization  is being conducted."    It is for these reasons that the Duma is now engaged first  and foremost in the development of the laws "On Public Property"  and "On the Administration of State Property." It is important  in these laws to clearly establish the responsibility of the  government for the implementation both of functional tasks (such  as, for example, support of the infrastructure) as well as tasks  in the income sphere. "The further spontaneous squandering of  property simply is impermissible under conditions of a sharp  reduction in the income part of the budget, and we hope that  order will finally be brought to this sphere in 1944, as well as  to the sphere of distribution of state credits and export  quotas."    The very same thing concerns the presidential position on  replacing an authorized right by a notifying right. "There is  probably not one businessman who would not severely criticize  bureaucratic arbitrariness in the resolution of entrepreneurial  activity. State interference has to be justified from a position  of economic effectiveness." In the law that the Duma is  preparing, according to Glazyev's words, it is the notifying  principle that will become the basis of economic activity so  that the development of small business would be the norm (by  making penetration of the market easier), and state regulation  would concern only public interests and the guarantee of  legality.    What is more, this task, in the opinion of the chairman of  the committee for economic policy, can be evaluated even more  highly than privatization. There are many enterprises that it  makes no sense to privatize--they are not efficient, and they  cannot avoid bankruptcy and readjustment. Nonetheless, the  government will have to be concerned about them. Far more  important is the formation of new enterprises that emerge  straight off according to the laws of the market. In the last  two years, this sector of work was abandoned--naturally, instead  of a market system, we acquired an extremely confused system of  property relations, which is rather reminiscent of the Yugoslav  model.    The Civil Code also has the very same coincidence of  priorities, Glazyev believes. "The absence of reliable legal  principles at the micro level today is the main obstacle to  rationalization of all of economic life: The lack of necessary  mechanisms of responsibility leads to chaos at the micro level,  which also gives rise to `macro chaos'--inflation, nonpayments,  and the like." The Duma is ready even to apply the Civil Code in  parts.    "It should be acknowledged that in many ways the law  enforcement organs are passive with respect to the fight against  unfair competition, deception, illegal advertising, and  corruption--this is associated in part with problems in  legislation." The fact that this problem was highlighted in the  president's message speaks not only of the logical coincidence  of positions, but also of the significance of this problem."    In Glazyev's opinion, however, it is not only the  legislative  "holes" that are to blame for the passivity of law enforcement  organs, but also simply the careless fulfillment of  responsibilities. Such as, for example, the continuous  advertising of the export of capital, and other violations of  legislation. "When I was still working for the MVES [Ministry of  Foreign Economic Relations], I made inquiries of the MB  [Ministry of Security] regarding the suppression of  advertisements of criminal activities in the mass media, but I  did not receive anything intelligible from there."    In the section "On Personal Security," Glazyev sees much  that  is similar, especially in the guarantee of health services.  "Practically all of the parties in the Duma note the need to  form a rational system of compulsory medical insurance." This  also concerns the involvement of Russian enterprises in the  production of modern medicines. "I introduced a proposal to  prohibit the allocation of state resources for the import of  equipment that is produced in Russia, but I did not find any  support," says Glazyev. The expenditure of taxpayers' money  should be for investment in economic growth in the country.  When, owing to this money, a stimulation of imports occurs,  this, in Glazyev's opinion, cannot be justified either from a  common-sense standpoint or from the standpoint of economic  theory. "We intend to make amendments to the law `On Supplies of  Products and Commodities for State Needs,' which will limit  opportunities for using state budget resources for the purchase  of foreign goods, thereby bringing our rules into conformity  with world practice." Although, in Glazyev's opinion, this  concerns not only the central, but also the regional budgets. An  example of this are imported luxury cars, whose purchase is made  by regional organs of authority against a background of slogans  about support for domestic producers.    According to the section "On Federalism," there is also much  that is in common: In the words of the former minister, the Duma  will work on the law on demarcating tax payments, legislation on  local self-government, and the guarantee of territorial  justice--all of this is in the plan of priority legislative  work. The sole difference with the president's message is  here--the harsh attitude toward treaties between the Federation  and its subjects. According to Glazyev's information, many in  the State Duma think that such treaties are dangerous. "The  treaties signed with a number of subjects of the Federation in  1992-1993 became the basis for disintegration processes and  demands for privileges and concessions in trade policy and in  foreign economic activity, which it is impossible to do if, of  course, we view Russia as a state with a single economic space  (as the president does in his message). In my opinion, this  development of internal treaty processes should be avoided."    The Duma will unquestionably support the process of review  of  privileges of individual territories that infringe on the rights  of other regions and their populations. "However, the need for  this, it was stated in the president's message, does not in any  way attach to the recent edict, for example, concerning  Kaliningrad Oblast."    Yeltsin's proposal on tax reform coincides with the  positions  of many Duma deputies. "The president's message talks about the  fact that rent can become an important source of incomes. This  is one of the conclusions of the economic conference that was  considered in the Duma and which consists in the need to  increase the role of rental payments in the incomes of the  federal and regional budgets."    Many theses and corresponding recommendations on  parliamentary relations are contained in the section "Toward a  Social State Through a Market Economy." "This, naturally, is an  increase in investment activity and the need to conduct a  structural restructuring. We also intend to adopt the laws `On  Foreign Economic Activity,' `On State Scientific-Technical  Policy,' `On Non-Commercial Organizations,' and `On State  Support of Small Business'--I already spoke earlier about  several other congruences."    In Glazyev's words, the Duma will support the reform of the  account system in the Central Bank. In particular, an  examination will be made of the laws "On Banks and Banking  Activity" and "On the Central Bank of Russia." "The thesis  contained in the report concerning the FRS [Federal Reserve  System], of course, needs serious analysis and detailed  deciphering, because there could be absolutely different models  of organization behind the words `Federal Reserve System'--both  in the configuration of the reserve banks and in their mutual  relations."    The thesis on the need to establish financial-industrial  groups aroused Glazyev's particular attention. In Glazyev's  opinion, this is the only realistic method today of overcoming  the break between the industrial and banking sectors. "In  1992-1993, the banking system developed separately from  industry, and it financed trade. The further parallel existence  of capital and industrial enterprises is simply impossible. This  is first. Second, the privatization program has led to a break  in many highly technological production chains, both vertically  and horizontally. The result was an increase in the sources of  inflation at a micro level. We did not achieve the elimination  of monopolism in the economy, but then we lost control, because  we took the path of breaking up the monopolistic enterprises.  Acceleration in the creation of FPG's [financial industrial  groups] is not only a necessary condition for achieving  competitiveness for Russian products on the world market, but  also for the achievement of macro-economic stabilization. This  point of view is shared by a majority in industrial and in  scientific circles--and it finds complete understanding in the  State Duma."    But if this thesis of the presidential message is followed,  then, as Glazyev thinks, "We will have to make a lot of changes  in the state privatization program. If the government conducts  the policy of the president, then it must go along with these  changes. We await a more considered approach to privatization  this year, and we hope that this work will move in contact with  the Federal Assembly (in accordance with the law, privatization  programs should have the status of federal laws, and not  presidential edicts)."    In Glazyev's opinion, in the part on the redesign of the tax  system, it is possible to ascertain almost a complete congruence  both with the position of the economic conference and with the  recommendations of the parliamentary hearings. The same applies  to the remarks of the president on the support of  science-intensive industry.    "Those spheres of the scientific-industrial complex that  could become the support of our economic growth are the ones  today that are the most exposed to destructive tendencies." In  this sense, the differences in the evaluation of the situation  in the country are quite fundamental for Glazyev. He thinks that  the irreversible "de-industrialization" of the country is  already moving at full speed: "We will not be able to  reestablish much of the science-intensive production, and we  have already lost substantial reserves of future economic  growth. The reckoning is literally in months--if emergency  measures to support science-intensive industry are not adopted  in the near term, then we could lose the prospect of growth or  even a partial restoration for all time--we will enter the zone  of a prolonged structural depression with the absence of any  kind of growth for a decade." Glazyev thinks that the passivity  of the government is "simply incomprehensible." For example, it  is not known to this day, however, whether the program for the  support of science-intensive exports, which was expected since  the middle of 1993, is included in the budget message for 1994.  The same applies to the president's initiative on social  partnership.    The Duma, according to Sergey Glazyev's words, is ready for  constructive work with the government to which a "majority in  the State Duma can render support in exchange for a clear and  reasonable program for leading the economy out of the crisis."  Thus, the memorandum of accord, which the Duma adopted in a  package with the decree on amnesty, contains a decree on the  need to conduct "roundtables" on economic and social policy "for  the purpose of developing a national accord on the main  directions of economic policy." However, Glazyev thinks that not  everyone in the apparatus of the executive branch is ready for  this.    The former minister notes the characteristic refusals of the  president's administration to give a basis for the edicts that  were submitted for review by the Federal Assembly. "Apparently,  it is necessary to bring order in the president's administration  in the sense of implementing the political line of the chief of  state"--Glazyev hopes that since the president's message came  out, there will be fewer possibilities for sabotage among the  workers of the administration. "If, of course, the leaders of  the administration of the president this time treat the line of  the president seriously and do not replace it with their own  interests."    Glazyev thinks that for today the main problem is  implementation of the coordinated priorities of economic policy,  in which the Duma will assist the government in every possible  way. However, in his opinion, the monitoring functions of the  State Duma should also not be forgotten and, based on the task  of their implementation, the Duma also requires publication of  the government program--the "Workers' Program" that exists today  for the implementation of priorities established by the  president and the State Duma is obviously inadequate.    According to Glazyev, the government program should include  not only a list of decrees that must be adopted without fail,  but also specific indicators and parameters for the desired  condition of the economy of the country, and also the planned  indicators for those departments that are engaged in the  management of state property. Glazyev also believes that a  system of monitoring the results of the economic policy being  conducted should be provided.</p>

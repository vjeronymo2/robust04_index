			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     The Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI)  will aggressively support stereolithographic rapid prototyping  beginning in fiscal year 1994. First, in January it plans to  establish a Rapid Prototyping Industry Association (tentative  name) for dissemination, R&amp;D, and fact-finding surveys. The  association will be made up of rapid prototyping apparatus  manufacturers such as D-MEC, a wholly owned company of Japan  Synthetic Rubber, users such as the Mitsubishi group's CMET, and  men of learning and experience.    It will grapple with the raising the level of rapid  prototyping (RP) in a four-year &yen;800 million plan as part of  the theme of ``Technology Development Work for Supporting  Knowledge Concentration in Small-Medium Companies'' of the Small  Business National Corporation to be newly established in fiscal  year 1994.    The purpose of MITI's support of the RP industry is to  promote new businesses in materials process technology  industries such as metal patterns.    RP technology is a method of creating 3-dimensional (3D)  forms layer by layer using CAD (computer-aided design) data and  light-hardenable resin on which laser beams are shined. MITI  sees RP technology as a basic technology for making things which  can't be made using metal patterns. MITI hopes that it will tie  in with the automation of design and will have broad  applications in medicine and welfare, too. It wishes to support  this technology as a new business for the metal pattern and  casting industries in which small-medium companies predominate.    However, since RP apparatus is expensive -- about &yen;50  million per machine -- its use is limited to applications such  as industrial working models and human periosteum. Accordingly,  R&amp;D themes include topics such as lowering costs of  manufacturing apparatus, laser development, technology for  application to casting machinery, and collaboration on CAD data.  Participants in the Rapid Prototyping Industry Association will  include manufacturers (such as Mitsui Engineering and  Shipbuilding Co., Denken, and 3D Systems of the U.S.), and  software companies, users, research institutions, and men of  learning and experience involved with RP. The initial general  meeting is to be held in January 1994.    A cooperative association for promoting R&amp;D will be set  up in  parallel with the Small Business National Corporation.</p>

			<p>920810 FT  10 AUG 92 / Letter: Abbey National house sales plan has flawed basis, ignores realities and is likely to fuel inflation (3) Sir, Houses are a commodity, with several hundred thousand a year being either built or coming on to the market as a result of the death of the owner. Until this fact is realised and house prices drop to a point that reflects the cost of building without any allowance for the site cost, then the house market will continue to stagnate. The site value is limited to any alternative use - which in the case of farming would represent less than Pounds 100 per plot. Jeremy Kilner, Choppards Mill, Holmfirth, Huddersfield HD7 1RW</p>

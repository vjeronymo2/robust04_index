			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / Survey reveals small-scale EU Only 7 per cent of the 14m businesses in the European Union have more than nine employees, according to a study by the EU's statistical office, Eurostat. Enterprises with fewer than nine employees account for around a third of EU employment and a quarter of the EU's Ecu10,500bn (Pounds 8,368bn) annual turnover. Small businesses are particularly important in Italy and Spain where they form the backbone of the economy. In Germany, France and Britain larger companies have a bigger share of employment. Only slightly more than 15 per cent of the Spanish workforce is employed in companies with 500 people or more, against 36 per cent in Germany. The survey, based on 1990 figures, which are the latest available, also show that the four largest economies in the EU - those of Germany, the UK, France and Italy - account for 67 per cent of the 14m EU enterprises, and for 75 per cent of the 92m people employed in the EU.</p>

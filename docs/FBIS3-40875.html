			<p>Language: <F P=105> Indonesian </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] On Monday (20 December) about 400 workers from PBI  (Purna Bina Indonesia) Inc. in Bontang complained to the East  Kalimantan DPRD I [Provincial Parliament] in Samarinda. They  complained about the application of minimum wage standards and  about the payment of vacation and overtime pay, which have not  complied with regulations. According to I Made Surata, a  representative of the workers, who was received by the East  Kalimantan DPRD, they were forced to come to Samarinda after  their efforts to solve the problem at the district level were  not successful. As former employees of PBI Inc., they met with  the company and the Department of Manpower as well as with the  SPSI [All-Indonesia Workers Association] in Bontang on 30  November; however, as of the third week of December they had not  arrived at any solution.    The construction and engineering workers who worked on Badak  Inc.'s Train F of the liquid natural gas plant in Bontang  arrived in Samarinda (120 km away) in 13 buses. H. Syarifuddin  Gairach, deputy chairman of the East Kalimantan DPRD I, and  leaders of the parliamentary factions met with seven  representatives of the workers.    Made Surata said that according to the minimum wage  standards  set by the government the workers should receive 108,000 rupiahs  per month. In fact, 750 workers at PBI Inc. Bontang were being  paid only between 65,000 and 103,000 rupiahs per month. Besides  that, according to the work agreement which they and the company  had signed, they were required to work seven hours a day. But in  fact they were made to work for eight hours without being paid  overtime. The workers also brought up some rights which the  company had violated, including making them work on Sunday and  not contributing to their health and annual leave funds.  <H5>  Flare-Ups </H5>   President Suharto is due to dedicate official operations of  the Bontang Train F liquid natural gas plant about the beginning  of February. Representatives of the former workers who went to  see the East Kalimantan DPRD I leaders asked them to intervene  and find a solution to their problems. If not, they intend to  bring the problems up when the plant is dedicated.    Syarifuddin Gairach, deputy chairman of the East Kalimantan  DPRD I, said that they would listen to the problems presented by  the workers and convey them to the agencies concerned.  Furthermore, the DPRD would look into the efforts to resolve the  violations of workers' rights. The East Kalimantan provincial  office of the Department of Labor hopes that the workers will be  patient until a meeting planned for Thursday (23 December) is  held.    In Samarinda itself there are frequent labor flare-ups  because there are many companies which are thought to be  violating workers' rights. A demonstration demanding payment of  wages was held by 1,600 workers of HJP (Hartaty Jaya Plywood)  Inc., which is located in the Loabakung industrial area,  Samarinda Ulu. They made this demand because the company had not  paid them for three months.    Even the governor of East Kalimantan got involved in this  problem because while HJP Inc. has been facing a financial  crisis in Samarinda, Hartono T. Sentoso, the managing director,  has been in Los Angeles since the beginning of the year. The  company was finally able to pay the 1,600 workers their wages on  1 December after the BDN [Bank Dagang Negara] injected some  funds into the company.  <H5>  No SPSI Unit Yet </H5>   After the HJP case was settled, another wage demand was made  by about 370 workers from JPP (Jati Prima Pratama) Inc. in  Loajanan and Nikita Inc. in Palaran, both involved in the wood  industry. The workers complained to the East Kalimantan DPRD I  on 15 December. Workers from the two companies, which are in the  same group, demanded the wages which had not been paid for three  months.    Workers from the two companies said that management always  promises to pay what they owe them whenever they demand it. The  most recent promise was for 15 December. When the promise was  not kept, they were forced to complain to the East Kalimantan  DPRD I in Loabahu.    Leaders of the East Kalimantan DPRD I asked the workers to  be  patient while the agencies concerned were asked to contact the  companies in order solve the problem right away. According to  the explanation given to KOMPAS, the two companies are in fact  having financial problems. Nanang Ismail, chairman of the  Samarinda SPSI, said that it was hard to look into the problems  faced by workers from those two companies because no SPSI unit  existed there yet.</p>

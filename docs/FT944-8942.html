			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Boots used CSFB for drugs disposal Boots passed over SG Warburg, its officially listed financial adviser, and turned to CS First Boston to handle the Pounds 850m sale, announced this week, of its drugs business to BASF of Germany. 'We wanted somebody with a dispassionate view of the market,' the retail group said. 'The reason we chose CSFB was that they had broad international experience of the healthcare market.' None of the parties would confirm whether Warburg had bid for the mandate on the sale of the pharmaceutical business but Boots did say that it had been prepared to listen to what anyone would say. Despite its absence on the deal with BASF, Warburg nevertheless managed Boots's Pounds 508m share buy-back, the largest ever on the London market, a role which played to its strengths in distribution. On Boots' choice of adviser Warburg said: 'Big companies like Boots are very sophisticated users of investment banking services. They don't just buy from one particular source.' In a similar recent case, Reckitt &amp; Colman used Goldman Sachs of the US to sell the Colman mustard business while retaining established adviser Warburg to handle a US acquisition. US companies also look more broadly for advice and Warburg stands to benefit from that. The UK house pointed at its work last year restructuring Marriott, the US hotel group. Large UK companies have become steadily less attached to their established financial advisers named in the Crawford's directory of city connections. Boots said CSFB had been hired over Warburg precisely 'because they weren't our traditional advisers'. CSFB, while bringing what Boots hoped was a fresher perspective to the sale, has previously worked with Boots on disposals in the US in 1989-90.</p>

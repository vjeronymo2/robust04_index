			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Press Statement [tamhwa]" by a spokesman of the DPRK </F> Atomic Energy General Department on 2 June -- read by announcer]    [Text] A spokesman for the DPRK General Department of the  Atomic Energy issued a press statement yesterday [2 June]  denouncing the unjust pressure commotion [pudanghan amnyok  sodongul kyutanhaeso] by the International Atomic Energy Agency  [IAEA] and some member nations of the UN Security Council over  our core refueling operations [nosim yollyo kyoche].    The press statement reads:    Recently, the IAEA Secretariat submitted to the UN Security  Council a wrong report related to the core refueling operations  at the five megawatt experimental nuclear power plant in the  DPRK, misrepresenting facts as if our method of the core  refueling operations would make the technical possibility of the  later measurement of fuel rods difficult. Accordingly, the UN  Security Council hastily adopted a so-called presidential  statement.    As is known, our five megawatt experimental nuclear power  plant had no other choice but to begin the core refueling  operations from early May for technical or safety reasons.    Since we are in a special status [tuksu chiwi] following the  temporary suspension of the effectuation of our declared  withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, we are not  under obligation to accept routine and ad hoc inspections  [chonggi mit pijonggi sachal] under the safeguards agreement but  are obligated only to ensure inspection in the scope for the  continuity of safeguards [tamboui yonsoksong pojange piryohan  pomwiui sacharul pojanghamyon toenda].    The selection and securing [sontaek pogwan] of some fuel  rods  requested by the IAEA with regard to the core refueling  operations is activities for the verification of the  completeness of the initial report. In the long run, this  activity falls under the category of ad hoc inspection.    Therefore, the selection and securing of some fuel rods can  never be allowed before our special status is dissolved  [haesodoegi chonenun].    But, we are doing the core refueling operations in such a  manner to fully guarantee [chungbunhi pojonhanun pangboburo] the  technical possibility for later measurement of such fuel rods as  requested by the agency in token of good faith [sonuijok chochie  ttara], anticipating a dissolution of our special status.    At present, the operations of the core refueling and all the  fuel in the transfer channel, spent fuel tub [pyeyollyo sujo]  and damaged fuel dry storage [pason yollyo konsik pogwango] are  under strict containment [pongswae] and surveillance by the  agency.    Two surveillance cameras installed by the agency at the  reactor hall, where refueling is going on, are monitoring the  core area [nosim kuyok], fuel channels, equipment hatch, and  movements of the refueling machines. The agency's spent fuel  rod counter system [pyeyollyo kyesugi] with a silicon  semi-conductor detector [kyuso pandoche komchulgi], a fission  chamber [punyolham], an ionization chamber, and a position  sensor has been installed in the spent fuel discharge channel to  constantly measure and count the spent fuel being discharged  into baskets.    The agency has installed thermoluminescence detectors and  sealing devices in all the channels which may be considered to  be diversion paths and two surveillance cameras in the building  of the spent fuel tub to monitor and control the flow of nuclear  material.    Notably, at the time of the inspection in May, in order to  increase efficiency of the surveillance devices of the IAEA  during the refueling, we provided all the conditions requested  by the agency, such as the replacement of computers and their  parts in the spent fuel rod counter [pyeyollyo kyesugi], the  installation of uninterruptable power [mujongjon chonwon] supply  to the IAEA surveillance devices and a lighting system for the  spent fuel tub building.    Thus, the non-diversion of nuclear material during the  refueling is firmly guaranteed. This is admitted by the  inspectors of the agency now observing the whole procedure of  refueling.    Our core refueling operations are being done in such a  manner  to guarantee the technical possibility of later measurement.    The fuel rods have been unloaded from the reactor core by  the  refueling machine channel by channel, area by area [kuyokpyollo]  in sequence in the reactor hall, and all the spent fuel rods  from four channels have been discharged into one basket.    Baskets of spent fuel are placed in their own positions of  the spent fuel tub.    All the refueling operations, including recording the  basket identification number, the channel identification number,  the sequence of fuel rods in channels, and the position of  baskets in the tub, are being correctly recorded in accounting  and operating books [hoegye mit unyong mungon].    Also the identification number of baskets and their  positions  in the tub are being strictly ascertained by the agency's  inspectors now present during the refueling operations.    This shows that the refueling operations are now being  conducted in the presence of IAEA inspectors in such a manner to  guarantee technical possibilities of their future measurement.    So, it is possible to reconstruct the channels of the fuel  rods in baskets and the sequence of rods in the channels in any  time if necessary.    The channels of fuel rods and the sequence of fuel rods in  them can be identified by means of the measured value of the  gamma rays for the fuel rods and the calculated value of the  distribution of neutron flux along the channels.    This method has been fully proven through experiment under  wet and dry conditions. When this method is applied, the  working amount of measurement may be slightly larger than that  by the method of selecting fuel rods in the reactor core. But  it is the only rational method [yuirhagye hamnijogin pangbop] in  our present situation.    It is a scientific method proposed by the operators in the  spirit of cooperation, out of the sincere desire to demonstrate  the transparency of our nuclear activities even in the special  status.    At the consultation held in Pyongyang a few days ago as  regards the refueling, the head of the IAEA delegation also said  that the method we proposed was theoretically reasonable  [ironjoguro tadanghadago hamyonso] and that he would study it  back at the agency and inform us of the results.    Nevertheless, some officials [kyechung] of agency's  Secretariat hurriedly submitted to the UN Security Council a  report based on their unilateral, unjust judgment [ilbangjogin  pudanghan pyongga] that the technical possibility of a future  measurement of the fuel rods is insufficient [pulchungbun], on  May 27 when the negotiations were under way, before the  consultation team arrived in Vienna, not waiting for the results.    Since the agency promised us to study our proposal after  going back to Vienna, it should have given us a scientific and  technical clarification on it.    Meanwhile, the UN Security Council did a very irresponsible  and unfair thing [simhi muchaegimhagye pyongyonjoguro haengdong  hayodda] according to a scenario written by some member nations  beforehand, claiming that the core refueling operation must be  made in accordance with the demand of the agency and, if not,  the technical possibility of later measurement of the fuel rods  might be lost.    Such an unjustifiable behavior [pudanghan chosa] of the  agency Secretariat and the UN Security Council was not merely by  chance.    The agency Secretariat deliberately avoided being present at  the refueling, ignoring our just proposal for its presence from  the beginning, and hindered [chijangul chuodda] the normal  operation of our nuclear facilities. When we were compelled to  start the refueling operation for technical or safety reasons,  it charged [sibihae nasodda] that we started the refueling in  the absence of the agency inspectors.    The unjustifiable pressure campaign [pudanghan amnyok  sodong]  launched by the IAEA and some member nations of the UN Security  Council with regard to our core refueling operation bears close  resemblance to their previous pressure campaign based on the  results of the inspection in March.    It is their trite method to lay deliberately lay obstacles  in  the way of the solution to the nuclear problem by unreasonably  [pudanghagye] taking the issue to the United Nations and  internationalizing and politicizing it each time some progress  has been made in its solution by our sincere efforts and  flexible position [sinchuksong innun ipcang].    Facts clearly show that the agency Secretariat has pursued a  sinister political purpose [pulsunhan chongchijok mokchogul  chuguhago ittanungosul] of crushing [apsal] us from the  beginning according to a ready-made scenario, far from taking a  stand for a fair solution [kongjonghage haegyol hajanun  ipchangiragi podanun] to our nuclear issue.    If some officials of the IAEA Secretariat declare that the  technical possibility of the future measurement of the fuel rods  is gone, we cannot but take a decisive countermeasure [kue  taeunghan kyolchongjogin chochirul chwihaji anunulsu opke  doelgosida].    If the agency Secretariat truly wants a solution to our  nuclear problem, it must not continue expanding its partiality  [pulgongjongsong] with such unreasonable acts [pudanghan  haengwi] as hurriedly submitting a report based on a wrong  judgment [kuruttoen pyongga] to the UN Security Council as it  did this time, but squarely look at the reality and return to  its original, fair position befitting an international  organization.</p>

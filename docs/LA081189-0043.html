			<p><P> August 11, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOME TECH: VIDEO NEWS;  </P> <P> THIS WEEK'S MOVIES  </P> <P> Tom Hanks' star power helped "The 'Burbs" (MCA, $89.95, PG) make $34 million at  movie theaters earlier this year -- and it needed the help. Directed by Joe  Dante, this juvenile comedy with bad neighbors and worse taste also stars Bruce  Dern, Rick Ducommon and Carrie Fisher. Times film critic Kevin Thomas found it  "grimly unfunny."  </P> <P> Also rolling into theaters earlier this year was "Gleaming the Cube" (Vestron,  $89.98, PG-13), in which a skateboarder tries to find his brother's murderer.  Christian Slater, Steven Bauer and Richard Herd star.  </P> <P> From 1972, "Pete 'n' Tillie" (MCA, $79.95, PG) stars Walter Matthau as a  bachelor whose wild ways are tested when he marries a secretary (Carol  Burnett). From 1967, "Devil's Angels" (Trylon, $69.95) is a cheap motor-psycho  movie starring John Cassavetes and shouldn't be confused with the same year's  superiorly lurid "Hell's Angels on Wheels" (with Jack Nicholson).  </P> <P> Trylon has also just released two other AIP cult films from the '60s for $69.95  each, "Dr. Goldfoot and the Bikini Machine," starring Vincent Price, and  "Pajama Party," starring Annette Funicello and Tommy Kirk, as well as the 1988  independent comedy "The Beer Drinker's Guide to Fitness and Filmmaking"  ($89.95, PG).  </P> <P> This week's top repriced video: "Rambo III" (IVE) falls to $19.95.  </P> <P> Other New Videos  </P> <P> Is it too early for Christmas videos? Family Home Entertainment doesn't think  so. This week FHE releases four Yuletide tapes (previously shown on TV) for  $14.95: "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer" (the "Animagic" musical version  narrated by Burl Ives, 53 minutes), "Santa Claus Is Coming to Town" (narrated  by Fred Astaire, 53 minutes), "Little Drummer Boy" (with the voices of Greer  Garson, Jose Ferrer and the Vienna Boys Choir, 30 minutes), and "Frosty the  Snowman" (narrated by Jimmy Durante, 30 minutes).  </P> <P> Video-game helpers: MPI has released the second volume of its "Secret Video  Game Tricks, Codes &amp; Strategies" ($14.95, 45 minutes). It focuses on  Nintendo-compatible games, as does "Video Game Guide" (Studio Video, $9.99, 40  minutes). For information on the latter tape, call (800) 541-1843. TERRY  ATKINSON  </P></p>

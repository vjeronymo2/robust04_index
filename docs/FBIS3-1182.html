SADF chief General Georg Meiring  said in a statement on Monday [21 March] the forces' involvement  in the country's internal situation would be determined by the  level of unrest or violence prevalent over the election period.    "The defence force, however, cannot afford to wait and see  how the situation develops before making contingency plans to  provide whatever support may be required.    "Therefore, after studying the likely scenarios and seen  against the background of the present volatile situation,  especially in certain areas of the country as well as the fact  that the defence force was obliged to fill the gap left by the  troops seconded to the NPKF (National Peacekeeping Force), we  were left with no option other than to call up members of the  part-time forces for service," Gen Meiring said.    He said the presence of the troops would release more  policemen to concentrate on routine policing and the protection  of polling stations.    The call-up was being conducted on a decentralised basis  throughout the country and although the majority were members of  the South African Army, they also included members of the SA Air  Force, SA Navy and SA Medical Services.    "I give the absolute asurance that we will call up only the  minimum number needed to provide the support the defence force  has predicted will be required," Gen Meiring said.    "The normal channel for applications for exemptions and  deferments is in operation, but exemptions and deferments will  only be granted in exceptional circumstances."    He appealed to those called up to report for service in the  interests of stability, peace and an unrest and violence-free  election. "If ever there was a time for all of us in the defence  force to put our shoulders to the wheel and to make a personal  sacrifice in the interests of all the people in our country, it  is now," Gen Meiring said.</p>

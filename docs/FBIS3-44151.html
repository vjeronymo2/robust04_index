			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Uganda National Democratic Alliance [UNDA] and  the Uganda Federal Army [UFA], which have been fighting a  guerrilla war against the ruling NRM [National Resistance  Movement] government, have resolved to suspend their armed  struggle and join fellow Ugandans in trying to influence the  history of the nation through nonviolent means. In a telefax  message signed in London today, the chairman and commander in  chief of the organization, Mr. Sam Luwero, said the leadership  of the alliance had also decided to dissolve the organization,  close its offices in London and cease the publication of "Focus  on Uganda" which has been the mouth-piece of the UNDA/UFA. The  leadership of the UNDA/UFA had further decided to accept the  Uganda Government's assurance that all former members of the  UNDA/UFA shall not be prosecuted and are free to return and join  other Ugandans to help the government in its task of democratic  process presently going on in the country.    In addition, the UNDA/UFA pledged their total solidarity  with  the Uganda Government in all its endeavors to establish a  pragmatic process of true democracy in Uganda. The statement  said the decision was in recognition of the fact that the NRM  government has gone some way in trying to implement most of the  elements encompassed in the UNDA manifesto of November 1991.  The decision was also prompted by the fact that the people of  Uganda are currently involved in an ongoing constitution-making  process.    The statement stressed that it is imperative that all  peace-loving citizens in our country give (?this venture) a  chance. The statement added that continued military action is  no longer a viable option for the UNDA/UFA struggle.    We must, the statement said, avoid turning our country into  another Somalia, Liberia, or Bosnia. That is why the leadership  of the UNDA/UFA said we (?heed) this directive. They instructed  all members of the UNDA and officers and men of UFA to  immediately observe an unconditional cessation of all  hostilities against the NRM government.</p>

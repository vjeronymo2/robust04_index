The establishment of diplomatic ties between Korea and Libya  reflected the common aspirations and desire of the two peoples  for the building of a new society, NODONG SINMUN in a signed  article says, and goes on:    After the opening of diplomatic relations the two peoples  have hastened the building of a new society supporting and  closely cooperating with each other under the banner of  independence against imperialism.    The Libyan people are today building a new society at an  accelerated pace under the guidance of Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi,  leader of the Great September First Revolution.    The courageous Libyan people are advancing along the road  chosen by them, not yielding to the pressure of the imperialists.    The Korean people rejoice as over their own over the  achievements gained by the Libyan people in their efforts for  the building of a new society, and support their work for a  peaceful and fair solution to the case of airliner explosion in  1988.    The Korean people will, in the future, too, make active  efforts to upgrade the friendly relations with the Libyan people.    MINJU CHOSON in a by-lined article says the Korean people  wish the Libyan people greater success in their efforts to build  a new society.</p>

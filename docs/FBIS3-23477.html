A statement signed by the  secretary to the government, Alhaji Umaru Dewa, said that the  security agencies had found the pamphlets being circulated  within the state to be fake. The statement said that while the  origin of the publication was being investigated, the public  should disregard its content and any similar leaflets that might  preach chaos and disaffection among the people. It urged  religious leaders of all faiths to prevail on their followers to  be calm and go about their lawful business. NAN gathered that  the leaflets, purported to have been written by an unknown group  called Islamic Jihad International Organisation of Nigeria" [no  opening quotation mark as received] had expressed  dissatisfaction with some appointments and activities of the  state government. In the publication the group threatened to  attack some government edifices as well as places of worship to  register its grievances.</p>

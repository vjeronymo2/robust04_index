			<p>Article   Type:CSO     [Editorial Report] The 2 December 1993 issue of Belgrade  VOJSKA, the weekly published by the Federal Ministry of Defense,  carries on page 22 an article by Petar Boskovic about a  fact-finding visit to two Yugoslav Army garrisons in the Raska  [Sandzak] region. In talks with the garrisons' commanders,  Colonel Zlatko Radisavljevic of the Raska garrison and  Lieutenant Colonel Milutin Petronijevic of the Novi Pazar  garrison, VOJSKA was informed that the two garrisons cover a  large area of the Raska region with an overall Muslim majority  (52 percent), though the percentage varies from place to place.  For example, VOJSKA states, in Tutin the population is only 2  percent Serbian, and the sitution is similar in the villages of  Dunisici, Fijulje, Mitrova, and Dubovo. It should be stressed,  VOJSKA adds, that until recently all these places had Serbian  majorities.    "This is a region that has been known for draft-dodging and  boycotting of the former Yugoslav People's Army and the present  Yugoslav Army. Even the small number of recruits called up  encounters the strong disapproval of the locality. During the  war one could feel increased nationalism and intolerance toward  Serbia and everything that is Serbian. Disrespect of the  government and creation of a parallel government, purchase of  weapons and forming of paramilitary units is just a small part  of the `green [Muslim] transversal' that crosses this region. A  large number of recruits, in order to avoid mobilization, left  with their families for Bosnia before the war, where they later  became active in the Muslim units, and sent their families back  to Serbia where they are now treated as refugees," Commander  Radisavljevic said to VOJSKA.    The situation in Raska is now different, VOJSKA states, and  the "green transversal" has been broken in several places, among  others at the Rogozna plateau, where intensive work is being  carried out to revive poor Serbian villages. A new police  station has been set up, and the army is building roads. Budjevo  village in Pesterska plateau, where Muslims slaughtered about  100 Serbs during World War II, has been given priority. The  action is called "Budjenje Budjeva" [The awakening of Budjevo]  in which all well-intentioned inhabitants, including quite a few  Muslims, are participating, VOJSKA states, adding that everyone  agrees that the army is a great factor of security in this  region.</p>

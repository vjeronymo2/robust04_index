			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Proposed Amendment <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> By letter dated August 2, 1993, Utah submitted a proposed amendment to its program pursuant to SMCRA (administrative record No. UT&hyph;851). Utah submitted the proposed amendment at its own initiative. Utah proposed revisions to the Utah Rules of Practice and Procedure of the Board of Oil, Gas and Mining (Board) at Utah Administrative Rules (Utah Admin. R.) 641&hyph;112&hyph;100, scope of rulemaking, and 641&hyph;112&hyph;200, promulgation of rules. Utah also proposed revisions to the Utah Coal Mining Rules at Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;100&hyph;500, petitions to initiate rulemaking; 645&hyph;103&hyph;441, hearing requirements for designating areas unsuitable for coal mining and reclamation operations; 645&hyph;203&hyph;200, confidentiality of coal exploration information; 645&hyph;301&hyph;524.661, permit application blasting level chart; 645&hyph;301&hyph;731.760, permit application cross sections and maps showing hydrologic information; and 645&hyph;302&hyph;314.110 and 645&hyph;302&hyph;323.310, special areas of mining, specifically prime farmland and alluvial valley floors. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSM published a document in the August 27, 1993  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (58 FR 45305) announcing receipt of the amendment and inviting public comment on its adequacy (administrative record No. UT&hyph;865). The public comment period ended September 27, 1993. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> During its review of the amendment, OSM identified concerns for (1) Utah Admin. R. 641&hyph;112, regarding the incorrect reference to its rulemaking authority at Utah Code Annotated (UCA) 40&hyph;9&hyph;3.5(2), which was repealed by Utah in 1993; (2) Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;103&hyph;441, regarding the need for agreement between the petitioners and intervenors to change the location of a public hearing on a petition to designate lands unsuitable for mining; (3) Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;203&hyph;200, regarding the proposed deletion of the phrase ``and the information is confidential'' which would impart a change in the criteria for determining coal exploration information that is or is not allowed to be held confidential under the Utah program, and the proposed reference to Utah's Government Records Access and Management Act (GRAMA) in that certain aspects of GRAMA were previously found to be less effective than the Federal regulations with regard to the restrictions it imposes on the availability of coal exploration information; and (4) Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;302&hyph;314.110, regarding the need to use the prime farmland soil survey standards in U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Handbook 436, as it existed on October 5, 1982, and USDA Handbook 18, as it existed on November 16, 1982. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSM notified Utah of the concerns by letter dated December 9, 1993 (administrative record No. UT&hyph;878). Utah responded in a letter dated January 7, 1994, by submitting a revised amendment (administrative record No. UT&hyph;881). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Utah proposes the following additional revisions to its existing rules. At Utah Admin. R. 641&hyph;112, Utah proposes to reference UCA 40&hyph;8&hyph;6(1), which applies to rulemaking authority under the Utah Mined Land Reclamation Act. At Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;103&hyph;441, Utah proposes (1) that unless the petitioners and intervenors agree otherwise, the Board shall hold a public hearing within 10 months after receipt of a complete petition to designate lands unsuitable for mining; (2) if all petitioners and intervenors agree that a public hearing is not needed, the hearing need not be held; and (3) all hearings held under Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;103&hyph;441 will be held in the locality of the area covered by the petition. At Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;203&hyph;200, Utah proposes to require that the Utah Division of Oil, Gas and Mining will not make coal information available for public inspection if the person submitting it requests in writing , at the time of submission, that it not be disclosed and the information is confidential under the standards of the Federal Act (SMCRA). At Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;302&hyph;314.110, Utah proposes to require that USDA soils Handbooks 436 and 18 are incorporated by reference as they respectively existed on October 5, 1982, and November 16, 1982. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Public Comment Procedures <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> OSM is reopening the comment period on the proposed Utah program amendment to provide the public an opportunity to reconsider the adequacy of the proposed amendment in light of the additional materials submitted. In accordance with the provisions of 30 CFR 732.17(h), OSM is seeking comments on whether the proposed amendment satisfies the applicable program approval criteria of 30 CFR 732.15. If the amendment is deemed adequate, it will become part of the Utah program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Written comments should be specific, pertain only to the issues proposed in this rulemaking, and include explanations in support of the commenter's recommendations. Comments received after the time indicated under ``DATES'' or at locations other than the Albuquerque Field Office will not necessarily be considered in the final rulemaking or included in the administrative record. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

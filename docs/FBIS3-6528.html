			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 18 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa on Friday voiced renewed concern about North Korea's  alleged nuclear weapons development program, a Foreign Ministry  official said.    "In this (Asia-Pacific) region, a series of favorable  developments can be seen after the end of the Cold War, but  there are some destabilizing factors such as North Korea's  nuclear (program)," the official quoted the premier as saying in  an interview with journalists from China.    North Korea is suspected of producing nuclear weapons at its  facilities in Yongbyon, about 90 kilometers north of Pyongyang.  It has refused to permit the International Atomic Energy  Agency, the Vienna-based international nuclear watchdog, to  conduct checks at a nuclear site.    The interview, held at the premier's official residence for  nearly an hour, came a day before Hosokawa begins an official  three- day visit to China. During his stay, he will meet with  Chinese Premier Li Peng and other leaders in Beijing and make  inspections of an economic development zone in Shanghai.    Hosokawa expressed hope to reaffirm with Chinese leaders the  shared view that Tokyo and Beijing should further enhance their  ties so that together they can contribute to the international  community, the official said.    "I wish to have a meaningful and candid exchange of views  with them to further promote Japan-China ties toward the 21st  century," he reportedly said.    Touching on expanding bilateral trade and growing Japanese  investment in China, Hosokawa also told the Chinese reporters  that the prospects for Japan-China economic and trade relations  are bright.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Georgian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Abkhaz Ministry of Defense has released  information which claims that at 0200 on 7 February Georgian  guerrilla units in Abkhazia attempted to blow up a road bridge  near Gali and that the attempt was foiled by Abkhaz militants.  The same report says that the Georgian side shelled Abkhaz  positions for 30 minutes.    This information was deliberately spread by the Abkhaz  separatists, in order to blame the Georgian side for violating  the agreement on a peaceful settlement of the conflict in  Abkhazia and to block the return of refugees to Gali Rayon.    In this connection, the press center of the Georgian Defense  Ministry has stated the Georgian Armed Forces strictly adhere to  the Geneva agreement and have not been engaged in any  hostilities.    As for the loss of 60 people in Okumi [village in Gali  Rayon], this information does not correspond to reality either.</p>

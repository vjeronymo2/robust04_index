			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 6. Provision of an Account Reconciliation Period  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA recognizes that as the phaseout enters the final year  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1995) for production and consumption of class I controlled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substances (except methyl bromide), the administrative task  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increases for a company to ensure that it has a balance of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allowances at the end of the year. This is particularly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> difficult given the need to meet requirements for each controlled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substance and to reconcile transformations, destructions,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exports, imports and production. Several companies that produce,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> import, export, transform or destroy controlled substances have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requested a period in which to reconcile all previous  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transactions in a year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA is proposing an administrative change to ease the end-of-year burden of reconciling the balance of allowances without  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> changing the level of environmental protection provided by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulation. To ease this burden, EPA is proposing a 45-day  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period of reconciliation beyond the end of the control period in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which persons may make inter-pollutant transfers of class I  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> controlled substances as defined in the current regulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Inter-pollutant transfers of controlled substances can only be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> made between controlled substances in the same Group as listed in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix A and F of Subpart A. In addition, the inter-pollutant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transfer must be authorized by EPA and will include a one percent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> offset. The Agency is proposing that inter-company trades not be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allowed past the end of the control period (December 31st of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1995), and every subsequent control period for methyl bromide. The proposal allows for a potential net environmental benefit and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> greater flexibility for end-of-control-period compliance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed reconciliation period is being limited only to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inter-pollutant transfers, in part, to provide a margin of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> latitude for companies in the final year of the phaseout when  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> balancing production and consumption allowances at the end of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> year is important before closing the books. For many companies,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the final year will be particularly difficult because there is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> less margin of error afforded in the amount of allowances  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provided for imports and production. Inter-pollutant transfers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at the end of the control period are intra-company adjustments to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the balance of allowances through paper accounting rather than an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> extension of the control period for trades, exports or transfers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> between companies. EPA seeks comments on the proposed period for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the reconciliation of these specific allowances at the end of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 7. Additional Clarifications  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> a.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Unintended by-products of research and development. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  EPA proposes adding the production of unintended by-products of research and development applications to the list of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inadvertent or coincidental creation of insignificant quantities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of listed substances in Appendix A or Appendix B in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> definition of ``controlled substance.'' The Agency is proposing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that these inadvertent or coincidental creations of insignificant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quantities of unintended by-products during research and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> development applications not be considered controlled substances.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency believes that an unintended by-product a substance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> generated during research and development can be considered an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inadvertent creation of a controlled substance. In addition, EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> received information from various companies that the amounts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> generated during research and development applications are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> generally insignificant quantities. The Agency reserves the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> right to require a person to destroy the unintended by-products  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of research and development applications if they are determined  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to be no longer insignificant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Export of increased production that is received through a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> trade from a party. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  EPA proposes removing the requirements under &sect;82.9(b)(vi)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and &sect;82.10(c)(3) that compel increased production to return to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Party from whom a U.S. producer receives additional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> production or consumption allowances through an international  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> trade. As a result of this proposal, U.S. companies could  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> receive allowances through an international trade to produce for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> either the demand within the country from whom the allowances  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were traded or for the demand in the U.S. domestic market. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposal would permit greater international market flexibility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> without increasing global production of ozone-depleting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substances. EPA believes that U.S. producers will need greater  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> flexibility to meet domestic demand as they enter the final year  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> before the production of class I controlled substances is phased out (January 1, 1996). Sections 82.9 and 82.10 of the current  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulation permit international trades in accordance with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Protocol's definition of ``international rationalization'' as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discussed in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  proposed rule published on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> December 14, 1987. Today's proposal would further support  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> international rationalization by increasing opportunities for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> achieving ``economic efficiencies'' globally. Achieving these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> economic efficiencies is particularly important as all Parties  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> continue to reduce production prior to the phaseout in 1996. EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> seeks comments on the proposed amendment that would allow  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> international trades from Parties to meet market demand for class  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> I controlled substances within the United States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 8. Clarification of Reporting and Recordkeeping Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA is proposing amendments to the current recordkeeping  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and reporting requirements to more effectively address issues  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that have arisen and are likely to arise as the phaseout date is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> near and for the period following the end of production of class  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> I controlled substances in the United States. In addition, EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposes to amend reporting and recordkeeping requirements to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reflect the proposed changes discussed earlier.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Reporting and recordkeeping for transformation and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> destruction. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  As with the earlier section describing transformation and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> destruction (Section A.1.), this section distinguishes between  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the different categories of recordkeeping and reporting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements for producers, importers, transformers and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> destroyers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

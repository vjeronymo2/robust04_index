			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / International Company News: Hedge funds lick forex wounds - Patrick Harverson and Sara Webb on a sudden change in fortune US hedge and futures funds have made losses of up to 25 per cent so far this month following the recent turbulence in the world's financial markets. Tass Management, which tracks over 600 funds, mainly in the US, said the losses were primarily due to the unexpected moves in the yen/dollar exchange rate in the middle of the month and the fall in European government bond markets. Hedge funds are private investment pools which borrow huge sums of money to trade securities and currencies in financial markets. They are often managed very aggressively and can be highly geared. In the UK government bond market, the larger hedge funds typically trade as much as 10,000 futures contracts, equivalent to Pounds 500m nominal. Some of the largest and best known funds are managed by investment gurus such as Mr George Soros, Mr Michael Steinhardt and Mr Julian Robertson, and in recent years have built up an impressive record of above-average returns for investors. Mr Soros's Quantum Fund was said by one industry source to have lost up to 14 per cent of its value on February 14 as a result of the yen/dollar exchange rate move. Mr Stanley Druckenmiller, the fund manager, was quoted earlier this week saying the fund management group lost about Dollars 600m that day. In the last week, European government bonds have seen sharp falls, driven by activity in the futures markets, with traders reporting a tidal wave of selling by US hedge funds. Rumours circulated that some hedge funds had stopped trading temporarily as they exceeded permitted losses. One hedge fund manager said he had received a bank telex warning that up to 18 hedge funds had stopped operating, but added that these were small funds rather than household names. 'They're like mushrooms, they're always springing up all over the place, so it wouldn't be surprising if some of them did stop trading,' said a gilt trader at a US house. The problems of the past few weeks contrast markedly with last year when the average gross return for US hedge funds was 27.26 per cent, according to Miss Lee Hennessee, of Hedge Fund Select, which is part of Republic New York Securities and tracks over 800 funds. The biggest 'macro' funds, those designed to profit from changes in global economics, particularly changes based on major interest rate moves, fared even better, showing a gross return of 53 per cent last year. This year, however, the big hedge funds have been caught out by the rise in the Japanese yen against the dollar and the drop in European bond prices. Many of the big funds had built up sizeable long positions in Europe, especially in high-yielding bonds from countries such as Sweden, Spain, and Italy, as well as in the UK government bond market. At the same time, some funds, notably Quantum, had shorted the yen against the dollar in anticipation of a gradual strengthening in the US currency against a yen undermined by the weak Japanese economy. The hedge funds' reversal of fortune could well force them to adopt a more cautious strategy in the markets in future, with traders expecting the funds to invest smaller amounts, at least until some of the losses have been regained, and to refocus on risk control. 'Hedge funds should be hedged to reduce the downside risk: the problem is that a lot of them aren't,' says one hedge fund manager who claims to have reduced his losses to 1 per cent in February by hedging. 'Now investors are saying they don't want to be highly geared, and they are happy with an upside of between 15 and 20 per cent instead.' 'Investors in hedge funds will have to start learning that these returns of 70 per cent and 100 per cent are gone for the foreseeable future,' said one US hedge fund trader. 'The massive macro opportunities are not there anymore. The hedge fund industry has become a crowded field and a lot of people are chasing the same ideas.'</p>

			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / FT Exporter (12): Trust is often the only insurance - Risk finance and other financial products are often too costly for smaller companies. Mark Ford finds that these companies frequently look for alternative ways round the problem / Small businesses in the UK Small firms have been instrumental in the effort to boost UK exports - but it seems that they are often financing the risks themselves. A recent survey of UK exporters found that approximately half do not have a foreign exchange strategy to protect the value of receivables and a similar proportion do not use credit insurance. These findings suggest that owners or financial decision-makers in small firms choose to ignore what appear to be useful financial products for exporters. However, several reasons are put forward by those who own or work with small exporting firms to explain why these seemingly useful financial products, promoted by banks and financial institutions, might be unpopular with small firms. 'We have to take a calculated credit risk with overseas customers since any more finance charges or costs would punish profits drastically,' says Durgesh Patak, head of accounts at Birmingham-based Perfos Tooling, which employs 25 people and exports about Pounds 1m worth of engineering components each year. 'We feel that the banks' export services are geared more towards large multinationals rather than the small scale engineering company which, after all, makes the components that build the British manufacturing economy.' Mr Patak stresses that his firm's bank generally provides an excellent service - but, for Perfos to seek more overseas customers, financial products at the right price must be available. The leading clearing banks, predominant in the market for the provision of finance for UK small firms, claim to offer an excellent range of products to facilitate international trade. Yet, according to the survey - which was carried out for the Institute of Export and NCM Credit Insurance by the London-based Bank Relationship Consultancy (BRC) - many firms still say that their bank gives them no advice on trade finance. Staff restructuring within the clearing banks has led to a growing number of travelling advisers in many fields, including international trade finance. But however good the product is, if it is too expensive - or if it is perceived to be too expensive - the customer will not buy it. According to Joan Rundell, an independent export consultant who works with many small exporters in the West Midlands, export credit insurance policies offered directly by the insurers themselves can be inappropriately expensive. She suggests that an alternative, but still proportionately expensive, way for small firms to finance international trade is through products such as Barclays' Small Exports Scheme. In this scheme, firms can obtain loan finance and take out credit insurance which is covered under the umbrella of the bank's own credit insurance. Fears about the length of time exporters have to wait for payment are compounded in the case of sales to some less developed countries. Goods invoiced in sterling might, because of currency shortages, be paid late and in alternative currencies. Mrs Rundell cites cases of UK firms receiving only 75 per cent of the face value of their invoice. So what options are open to small firms who face currency, political or credit risk? The BRC survey suggests that most firms still finance export risks from working capital or through overdrafts which are not designed for or well suited to this purpose. The BRC survey finds an increasing number of UK companies are prepared to offer foreign customers prices in their own currency instead of in sterling  -a common reason for foreign buyers rejecting UK suppliers. From the small firm's perspective this would seem to be a logical strategy - if institutions are unwilling to insure a risk then it might as well be converted into a competitive advantage by offering customers the option of purchasing in their own currency. A paucity of statistics on small firms' export performance makes assessing the level of their international market penetration problematic. However, the general feeling among small firms in the West Midlands is that manufacturing firms, including consumer goods, producers of pottery, jewellery and sundry giftware products, are improving their performance. Mike Turner, overseas trade manager at Birmingham Chamber of Commerce. suggests that chamber members - most of whom are small manufacturing firms - have been reporting increasing exports for some time now and this year the improvement is gathering pace. A chamber survey revealed that, in the first quarter of this year, 33 per cent of firms reported export orders up (30 per cent did so in December 1993), 49 per cent (41 per cent in December 1993) reported export orders the same and, significantly, only 18 per cent (30 per cent in December 1993) of members reported falling orders. West Midlands firms are keen to explore new and more distant markets. 'There is an upward trend in exports, especially in far eastern countries and particularly south-east Asia. Japan is emerging as a potential market and sales to the Middle East remain steady following the Gulf War,' says Mr Turner. 'Of great interest to our members is South Africa, where we are organising a trade mission of 23 people, and in October we will be targeting Thailand, where we feel the market is about to take off.' Small firms have clearly been instrumental in industry's effort to export the UK out of recession. Moreover, it seems that they have often both financed and taken the risks inherent in selling to overseas markets. Even if small exporters do use financial products - which for smaller businesses are only available from a handful of banks - these products are most often proportionately more expensive for small than for large exporters. Instead of insuring against a business relationship turning sour by using products such as credit insurance, the small exporter, it seems, is more likely to build a sustainable business relationship with overseas customers based on trust and good communications.</p>

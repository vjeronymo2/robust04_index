			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / Beirut bomb breaks calm A car bomb exploded in a Shia Moslem suburb of Beirut yesterday, killing three people and shattering Lebanon's longest period of calm in two decades. Hizbollah (Party of God), a militant Shia movement fighting Israeli troops in south Lebanon, immediately accused Israel of responsibility. It said the blast in Bir al-Abed, a Hizbollah-dominated district, followed Israeli threats against the movement in the past few days and mounting tension on the battle lines in the south. The bomb exploded in a small shopping street in the impoverished suburb. It was the first bomb blast in Lebanon outside the southern battlefront with Israel since February 27 when an explosion in a Maronite church north of Beirut killed 11 worshippers and injured 50. The bomb ended 10 months of calm outside the south - the longest period of civic peace most of Lebanon has enjoyed since the start of the 1975-90 civil war.</p>

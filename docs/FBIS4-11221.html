			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Virginia Silveira] </F>   [Text] Sao Jose dos Campos -- By the next decade Brazil  should be joining the restricted club of countries that have  mastered the most advanced technology to obtain the enriched  uranium (235) that is used as fuel for nuclear reactors. The  Institute of Advanced Studies (IEAv) at the Aerospace Technical  Center [Centro Tecnico Aeroespacial -- CTA] in Sao Jose dos  Campos is already producing uranium 235 through the method of  separating isotopes with laser beams via atomic vapor.    The separation of uranium isotopes is an activity that  currently demands heavy investment. Colonel Hugo Pereira  Chaves, director of IEAv, says that among all the methods  currently known (gaseous diffusion, ultra centrifuge, molecular)  for uranium enrichment, the atomic process is best from the  economic point of view. This method, he adds, is also best from  the ecological point of view, given that the radioactive waste  may be recycled and treated.    The most widely used fuel element for nuclear reactors is  uranium, whose natural composition is as follows: 99.3 percent  is made up of an isotope with an atomic weight of 238, and 0.7  percent of an isotope with an atomic weight of 235. Most of the  existing nuclear reactors need "enriched" uranium. This means  increasing the 235 isotope content, which is radioactive, to a  concentration of greater than 3 percent.    The physical principle of the atomic separation method is  based on the different abilities of the 235 and 238 isotopes to  absorb light from well- defined frequencies, that is, light of  specific colors. The atomic process works with uranium in its  metallic form. The separation of 235 and 238 isotopes undergoes  three stages.    The metallic uranium is placed in a container heated to  3,000  degrees [scale not specified]. The uranium vapor generated by  the high temperature is absorbed by laser irradiation at a  frequency that attracts the 235 atoms to a metallic plaque, from  which they are extracted.    According to Col. Pereira Chaves, the IEAv has attained a  level of 50 percent uranium enrichment during the process of  exciting the 235 molecules. Extraction of uranium, however, has  yet not been possible at such a level, he said. He did not  reveal the level of enrichment already attained by the IEAv, as  it is an industrial secret.  <H5>  The United States </H5>   Col. Pereira Chaves reported that the United States has  already managed a 30 percent enrichment in its tests -- of which  very little is known. The industrial development of this  process is still not known in any other country of the world.  The Americans have already decided that the atomic separation  process with laser beams must be adopted by the United States on  a commercial scale in the next century.    Atomic separation, Pereira Chaves said, will replace the  current gaseous diffusion process that is underway. "Between  1972 and 1988 the United States invested $700 million in the  atomic process. An industrial scale demonstration will require  an additional $946 million," he added, according to IEAv  estimates.    The IEAv, according to Pereira Chaves, has allotted only  $71 million to its uranium enrichment program with laser beams  since 1981. Part of these resources, nearly $41 million, were  financed by the Aeronautics Ministry, and the rest came from the  National Nuclear Energy Commission (CNEN), the Funding Authority  for Studies and Projects (Finep), and the Strategic Affairs  Secretariat.    For the project to develop satisfactorily, Pereira Chaves  said, the institute would need something between $1.5 and $2  million per year. In the past three years, however, the  institute has been receiving less than $1 million per year for  the maintenance of its entire project structure, Chaves said.  <H5>  Molecular Process </H5>   In addition to the atomic process, the IEAv has concentrated  its research on uranium enrichment by laser beam through the  molecular method. The molecular method, according to Chaves,  uses uranium hexaflouride gas (UF6) mixed with a lighter gas  (carrier gas). The mixture is accelerated in a supersonic (high  speed) pipe, and is then cooled to a temperature of minus 190  degrees Celsius.    "Under those conditions UF6 molecules that have the uranium  235 isotope absorb laser radiation of a different frequency than  that absorbed by the molecules of uranium 238," Chaves said.    The molecular process, according to the director, is also  being studied as one of the alternatives that could be adopted  by Brazil for the industrial-scale production of uranium 235.  "The advantage of the molecular separation method is that there  is a facility in Resende (Rio de Janeiro), which was built under  an agreement signed with Germany in 1979," he said.    Another advantage is that researchers are already familiar  with the entire corrosion process caused by UF6, which they have  learned to control. The metallic uranium corrosion process  (used for atomic separation) is still unknown to them.  <H5>  Lower Cost </H5>   Research with the atomic separation method, however, is at a  more advanced stage, as it has succeeded in separating uranium  235, though at a laboratory level. Production costs, according  to the IEAv, are 23 percent lower than those for traditional  enrichment processes. "Until 1985, a total investment of $9.7  million was considered necessary for the operation, maintenance,  research, and development of the atomic separation method,"  Chaves said.    The figures, according to Chaves, are included in a study  made in the United States and published by the NUCLEONICS WEEK  newspaper. Based on the study, the United States invested in the  expansion of its uranium enrichment capacity through the laser  separation process.    In Brazil, uranium 235 is produced at an industrial scale by  the ultracentrifuge method, which is based on the mass  difference between isotopes. The Navy Ministry has a research  center that specializes in producing uranium through this method.</p>

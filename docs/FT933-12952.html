			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / German car production sinks lower in June THE slight improvement in German car orders, detected during May, ground to a halt again last month, the VDA automobile industry association said yesterday. June production of all vehicles, adjusted to allow for an extra working day this year, was 29 per cent lower than a year earlier at 344,000. Unadjusted output was down 25 per cent, the association said. Despite last month's setback, the decline in the car industry appeared to have reached the bottom, it added, but conditions for commercial vehicle makers were continuing to deteriorate in a slump which has now entered its third year. June's poor performance brought the cumulative decline in motor manufacturers' output to 25 per cent for the first half of this year. In absolute figures, car production has tumbled 625,000 to 1.975m. Output of light trucks up to 6 tonnes fell 34 per cent or 37,000 units to 72,000 between January and June, while output of other commercial vehicles was down 36 per cent compared with the same period last year. Most manufacturers have dealt with the slump by closing their works for at least one day a week for most of the year so far, while tackling the industry's structural problems with radical cost- and job-cutting programmes. Meanwhile, the industry has been busy reducing heavy stocks of vehicles which accumulated when the forecast recovery in international markets failed to appear at the end of last year. Inventories were further bloated by a sudden slump in domestic demand after the summer holiday period last year, when the post-unification sales boom ran out of steam. The German trade enjoyed a brief surge late last year, inspired by buyers rushing to avoid the effects of a one percentage point increase in value added tax in January, before continuing its decline. There are still no clear signs of overall improvement in Germany, where recession and fear of unemployment are still affecting demand, but there are some indications that foreign car markets may be coming off the bottom. Car exports, which account for around half the industry's output, were 19 per cent lower in June than in the same month last year, after being 25 per cent and 24 per cent lower in the two preceding months. Overall, car sales abroad are 20 per cent down in the six months to the end of June. The VDA, which in May reported a small improvement in car orders for the first time this year, said government plans to increase fuel taxes next January were hampering recovery. At the start of the year most German manufacturers forecast a 20 per cent drop in domestic car sales for 1993 and a decline of around 10 per cent in Europe as a whole. New registrations in the European Community in the first half were down 19 per cent, according to the European motor manufacturers' association.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                  German vehicle production and exports                             (Jan-June 1993)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                   Production              Exports                                1992        1993        1992       1993  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Cars                      2,600,091   1,974,600   1,318,685  1,053,000 Commercial vehicles (up to 6 tonnes)            108,985      72,000      52,788     38,700 Other commercial vehicles    78,055      49,600      33,447     23,900 Total                     2,787,131   2,096,200   1,404,920  1,115,600  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: VDA Automobile Industry Association  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

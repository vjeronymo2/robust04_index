			<p>940405 FT  05 APR 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei and region fall in fear of Wall Street decline Fears that Wall Street may suffer further falls discouraged investors, and equities lost ground again, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei 225 average ended 154.94, or 0.8 per cent, off at 19,122.22. The index opened at the day's high of 19,232,85 and fell as low as 18,896.48 during the morning session. Investors were worried that the New York stock market would continue to lose ground this week following last week's rise in US long-term interest rates, triggered by firm US labour data. However, market participants were reluctant to sell below the Nikkei 19,000 level due to concern that institutions will come in to support the index. Institutional investors, expected to buy stocks following the turn of the new business year, were absent. Volume stayed flat, at 230m shares, and trading was dom-inated by arbitrage-linked activity. The Topix index of all first section stocks finished 10.80 down at 1,560.38 and the Nikkei 300 declined 1.90 to 285.21. Falls outscored rises by 754 to 254, with 163 issues unchanged. In spite of the rise in the dollar against the yen, high-technology issues were depressed. Matsushita Electric Industrial slipped Y10 to Y1,700 and Sony receded Y40 to Y5,890. Auto makers were also lower, with Nissan Motor losing Y15 at Y814. Arbitrage selling hit banks, Industrial Bank of Japan declining Y10 to Y3,000 and Fuji Bank Y60 to Y2,100. Brokers were lower, Nomura Securities dipping Y30 to Y2,200. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone retreated Y2,000 to Y903,000. Reports that the company may be forced to postpone its increase in city rates, due to the cabinet's concern over the rise in a number of public fees on the economy, prompted selling by some investors. Housing shares were higher on hopes of rising demand. Misawa Homes firmed Y10 to Y1,040 and Daiwa House Industry Y20 to Y1,550. In Osaka, the OSE average fell 189.27 to 21,366.88 in volume of 7.1m shares. Nintendo, the video game maker, lost Y100 at Y6,630 on profit-taking. Roundup Wall Street worries gave most of the region a bad day. Hong Kong, Taiwan, Australia and New Zealand were closed for holidays. KUALA LUMPUR blamed Wall Street, rather than the central bank's currency losses, as investors liquidated their holdings. The KLSE composite index ended 31.61, or 3.3 per cent, lower at 928.33. Dealers said the market was jittery about the effect of the sharp fall in US bond prices last week on the Dow Industrial average. The day's losers included Genting, Telekoms and Maybank, in thin volumes. Some 114.8m shares worth MDollars 503m were traded. BANGKOK added some domestic political uncertainty, and the SET index closed 35.94, or 2.9 per cent, down at 1,196.59 in wafer thin turnover of Bt2.8bn, against Friday's Bt2.7bn, the lowest of the year. KARACHI noted that foreign funds and local institutions kept to the sidelines as the KSE 100 index fell 62.43, or 2.5 per cent, to 2,448.71 on profit-taking by jobbers. Volume was low, and the jobber selling was described as speculative. MANILA was led down by the big blue chips, Manila Electric and Philippine Long Distance Telephone. Meralco 'B' and PLDT each dipped by about 2 per cent, to 462.50 pesos and 1,700 pesos respectively, as the composite index declined 57.80, or 2.1 per cent, to 2,653.70. SINGAPORE fell in sympathy with the weak US bond market and in the absence of Hong Kong-based fund buying. The Straits Times Industrial index ended 41.78, or 2 per cent, off at 2,039.12. SEOUL staged a technical rebound centred on blue chips, asset play counters and low price/earnings ratio issues, which left the composite index 5.10 up at 860.47. There were rumours that the government may be considering measures to attract foreign investors, but the Finance Ministry denied these and brokers did not foresee an upward trend.</p>

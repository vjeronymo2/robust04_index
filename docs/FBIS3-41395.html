Det Sgt Tom Madden said he arrested Andrew Carass (26),  married and an unemployed barman, of Buckingham Village,  Summerhill, Dublin 1 on October 30, 1992.    Carass told gardai he was to get &pound;1,000 which he  wanted as  a house deposit. "I don't use drugs. It's only for fools. Jesus,  I'm sorry for getting into this," he told gardai.    Det Sgt Madden told Dublin Circuit Criminal Court that the  defendant had 98.9g of cocaine strapped to his back and 692  ecstasy and other tablets in two packages down the front of his  trousers.    Carass pleaded guilty to importing the drugs from Amsterdam.    Det Sgt Madden told Tom O'Connell BL, prosecuting, that the  cocaine was 80pc pure and could have been cut two or three times  before sale. Cocaine sold on the streets is usually 30pc pure  and this amount would have been worth &pound;50,000. The ecstasy  tablets had a wholesale value of &pound;4,500.    Carass told gardai he also owed gambling debts to drug  dealers. He flew to Brussels and took the train to Amsterdam  where he booked into a hotel. After receiving an early morning  phone call he collected the drugs at a bus shelter.    He had no money for the return flight to Dublin and had to  ring another man to pay for it. He didn't wish to name this man.    Det Gda Madden agreed with Patrick Marrinan BL, defending,  that Carass was easily led and had been used by other  experienced drug-dealers as a courier.    Father Dermot Peakin said he had known the Carass family for  30 years. They were very respectable and hardworking. The family  had gone through hell since the arrest.</p>

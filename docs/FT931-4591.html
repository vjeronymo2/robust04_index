			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Pict Petroleum ahead on weakened pound A WEAKER pound helped Pict Petroleum, the oil exploration company, report a surge in interim profits from Pounds 1.1m to Pounds 2.9m on turnover 19 per cent lower at Pounds 4.8m, against Pounds 5.9m. Mr John Lander, managing director, said currency gains had contributed Pounds 1.4m, against last year's Pounds 442,000 loss, to pre-tax profits for the six months to December 31. The stronger dollar and weaker pound had also helped to offset a decline in the oil price from Dollars 19.50 to Dollars 18.76 per barrel. Sterling barrel rates averaged at Pounds 10.94, against Pounds 10.99 last year. Mr Lander said the exchange rate was likely to continue to benefit the group in the second half. 'With a stronger pound, if nothing goes wrong, it should be a very good year-end,' he said. Cash balances rose from Pounds 15.9m to Pounds 16.9m, helping to boost interest income from Pounds 254,150 to Pounds 627,887. Earnings were 5.66p (2.97p).</p>

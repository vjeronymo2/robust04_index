			<p><P> September 14, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ZOO BOARD TO JOIN CITY INVESTIGATION OF VIOLATIONS;  </P> <P> ANIMALS: THE 37-MEMBER PANEL EXPRESSES SHOCK AT REPORTS OF SUBSTANDARD  CONDITIONS AT L.A. FACILITY.  </P> <P> The Greater Los Angeles Area Zoo Assn. board -- which includes a number of  Hollywood celebrities -- said Thursday it was "very disturbed" by reports of  substandard conditions at the Los Angeles Zoo and will join in a city  investigation of chronic violations of the federal Animal Welfare Act.  </P> <P> "It came like a shock to all of us," said actress Betty White, a board member.  "This came as just a shattering experience."  </P> <P> White said she questions the competence of zoo Director Warren Thomas, but will  wait to hear his explanation before judging the matter.  </P> <P> "There's got to be an awfully good other side to not have me up in arms," she  added.  </P> <P> A statement issued by the 37-member board said they had not been informed about  repeated citations from the U.S. Department of Agriculture as well as a warning  letter from the agriculture department that the zoo's license could be revoked  if the violations were repeated.  </P> <P> At a press conference, Thomas defended his management of the zoo and his  staff's competence and dedication to good animal care. He also said many of the  violations have been corrected and the rest will be addressed. "There's no  excuse," he said.  </P> <P> The Times reported on Thursday that the Griffith Park facility had been cited  repeatedly by USDA inspectors for more than three years for inadequate food  storage, sanitation and drainage problems, pest and rodent contamination,  inadequate housing, run-down animal barns and other violations of federal  regulations. Thomas also never replied to a letter sent to him by the USDA  nearly a year ago demanding an immediate response.  </P> <P> City officials reacted swiftly Thursday. Mayor Tom Bradley, who is traveling in  Europe, said in a letter issued by his staff that he is "deeply concerned"  about the violations found by the USDA and is "disappointed" that Thomas had  failed to notify the appropriate officials of the problems.  </P> <P> The letter, sent to Jim Hadaway, general manager of the Department of  Recreation and Parks, demanded an immediate report on the matter. The zoo is  owned by the city and operated by the Recreation and Parks Department in  conjunction with the 135,000-member zoo association.  </P> <P> A spokesman for City Councilman Joel Wachs said that the council's Arts, Health  and Humanities Committee, which Wachs chairs, will hold a hearing on the  problems at the zoo.  </P> <P> At a press conference Thursday, Thomas repeated his statement that he was  unaware of the USDA complaints until recent weeks and had begun a crash program  to address the problems. He said lower-level employees had failed to inform him  of the federal inspection reports.  </P> <P> However, Thomas signed a lengthy USDA inspection report more than a year ago  describing the violations, records show.  </P> <P> Asked about the apparent discrepancy, Thomas acknowledged that he signed the  report, but said that he did not read it. Instead, because of its length, he  passed it on to a staff member for analysis but never heard about it again, he  said.  </P> <P> Thomas was fired from the job of zoo director in 1986, but was reinstated the  following year by a federal judge who ruled that the firing had been improper.  </P> <P> In firing Thomas, city officials cited problems with various purchases and  sales. They also alleged that Thomas used racial epithets around zoo employees  and took zoo supplies for his own use. They argued that he was fired for good  cause, but the judge ruled that his civil rights had been violated.  </P> <P> Thomas R. Tellefsen, a real estate developer and chairman of the association  board, said the association intends to help the city investigate the current  problems and will take up the matter at an executive session next week.  </P> <P> "This situation took us by surprise," Tellefsen said. "We had no knowledge  about the USDA citations . . . and therefore we were pretty upset when we  learned about it."  </P> <P> The association is a nonprofit corporation that helps operate and raise funds  for the zoo. Its volunteer board is made up of business people and celebrities  including White, actresses Stephanie Powers and Carmen Zapata, and Gloria  Stewart.  </P></p>

			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / UK Company News: Fife Indmar Restructuring costs and increased interest charges saw Fife Indmar, the Edinburgh-based engineer, fall into the red and pass its final dividend in the year to December 31. Nevertheless, Mr Gavin Hepburn, chairman, expected the first quarter of the current year to show a profit. After exceptional restructuring costs of Pounds 644,000 (Pounds 271,000), the pre-tax deficit was Pounds 843,000, against profits of Pounds 906,000. A further Pounds 821,000 relating to closure costs was taken below the line. Turnover was virtually unchanged at Pounds 31.7m (Pounds 31.8m). Losses per share were 6.58p (earnings of 5.77p). The omission of the final (3.9p) leaves shareholders with 0.5p (4.9p) for the year.</p>

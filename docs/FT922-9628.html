			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / Japan announces big increase in payments surplus JAPAN'S current account surplus for March more than trebled to Dollars 13.58bn (Pounds 7.6bn), bringing the surplus for the 1991 fiscal year to Dollars 90bn, a 167 per cent increase and a likely source of trade friction with Washington. The leap in the surplus, which was not far below the peak of Dollars 94bn in 1986, included a record surplus of Dollars 113bn in the trade account, and is expected to prompt renewed international demands that Japan stimulate a slowing domestic economy. Balance of payment figures released by the finance ministry also showed the long-term capital account had a surplus of Dollars 40bn for fiscal 1991, a turnaround from a deficit of Dollars 16.8bn in the previous year and the first surplus since 1980. The surplus followed a sharp increase in foreign net purchases of Japanese securities, which rose from Dollars 60bn in 1990 to Dollars 101bn, and a smaller rise in Japanese net purchases of foreign securities, up from Dollars 48.8bn to Dollars 61bn. Bonds were Japanese investors' main target, as net purchases of foreign stocks fell from Dollars 847m to only Dollars 118m, while foreign capital was used to purchase a net Dollars 36.77bn in Japanese stocks, up from Dollars 15.92bn in fiscal 1990. Finance ministry officials said the current account surplus had peaked, and blamed the surge in March surplus on the payment of Japan's Dollars 9bn contribution to the Gulf War effort in the same month last year. But the government fears that the large total for Japan's 1991 fiscal year, which runs to the end of March 1992, will be an easy target for foreign criticism of Japanese trade and fiscal policies. Mr Matthew Berlow, economist at Credit Lyonnais Securities (Japan), said that the large current account surplus, in theory, should have been accompanied by an outflow of capital from Japan, but foreigners' purchases of Japanese securities in recent months had upset the trend. 'In the longer term, these figures must even out. There has been a lot of fears about Japanese pulling money out, but they are still buying foreign securities. We will have to see what happens in April,' Mr Berlow said. Japanese direct investment in 1991 was Dollars 23.6bn, down from Dollars 44.9bn, showing the effects of tougher financial conditions at home and the international recession. Foreign direct investment in Japan, as recorded by the ministry, doubled from a year earlier but was still a mere Dollars 2.2bn. The Japanese deficit in invisible trade, including tourism, fell 14.5 per cent from 1990 to Dollars 19.2bn, following an increase in transfers to Japan of investment income. In the overall balance of payments, the surplus soared from Dollars 961m in 1990 to Dollars 114bn.</p>

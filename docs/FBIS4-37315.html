			<p>BFN     [Text] Baghdad, 18 Jun (INA)--A delegation of the Yemeni  House of Representatives headed by Deputy Muhammad 'Abdallah  al-Kibsi arrived in Baghdad today on an official visit of  several days to Iraq.    In a statement to INA, Muhammad 'Abdallah al-Kibsi said that  he will meet with the National Assembly speaker, as well as the  leaders of professional and popular organizations and parties to  explain to them the serious implications of the violation of  constitutional legitimacy in Yemen by the secessionists. He  will also explain to these Iraqi officials, he noted, the  secessionists' efforts to abort unity, for which the Yemeni  people have made great sacrifices.    Al-Kibsi added: Our visit to fraternal Iraq comes in  implementation of a decision the Yemeni House of Representatives  has made in this regard. The objective of this decision, he  said, is to enlighten the Arab and Muslim nation, chief among  which are the Iraqi kinfolk and leadership represented by His  Excellency President Saddam Husayn, the epitome of the nation's  heroism, about the true state of affairs in Yemen. The Iraqis,  he went on to say, are the most concerned to safeguard unity and  democracy, and the people endowed with the best experience in  resisting injustice and aggression, thanks to the Mother of  Battles they have waged to deter the sinful aggressors and  traitorous rulers, who are subservient to foreigners.    The Yemeni parliamentarian noted the crimes the Yemeni  secessionists are committing against the country's unity,  security, and safety. He added: The war is not only one  between rebels and legitimacy forces. It is also a war aimed  against the Arab nation to humiliate it so that the enemies may  achieve their goals and realize their ambitions in this part of  the Arab homeland.    The Yemeni official concluded by saying that the Yemeni  government and people take pride in the pan-Arab positions of  Iraq under His Excellency President Saddam Husayn. He also  commended the leader president's heroic role in defending the  causes of the Arab and Muslim nation against all forces of  injustice, evil, and aggression that have targeted the present  and future of this nation.</p>

			<p><P> September 19, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOOD WORK IN SACRAMENTO  </P> <P> Was that some magic potion infecting Sacramento last week? If so, it could be  bottled and sold for a fortune. The mood was one of conciliation and compromise  right down to the end of the 1989 California Legislature. Intractable issues of  the sort that had put Democratic legislative leaders and Republican Gov. George  Deukmejian at bitter odds for years suddenly got resolved. After too many  sessions in which it seemed that California's leaders were more interested in  their own political stock than the future of the state, the current Legislature  produced a remarkable record of achievement.  </P> <P> Recent legislative closings too often were marked by exchanges of recrimination  over who was to blame for the defeat of important legislation. Wrap-up  summaries focused on unmet needs and legislators succumbing to the fear of  political retribution. But when the final gavel fell along about 4 a.m. this  past Saturday, observers marveled at the number of eleventh-hour compromises  that had salvaged important legislation. Democrats and Republicans found  themselves commending each other -- and seeming to mean it.  </P> <P> Not all was perfect, of course. About $150 million in budget items remain  unresolved. Important reforms in the fields of health insurance and workers'  compensation had to be scaled back to limited measures. There is plenty of work  left for the second half of the session beginning next January, with  election-year politics threatening to undermine 1989's mood of constructive  amiability.  </P> <P> Also, two major packages approved this year cannot be implemented unless they  get voter approval at the June primary election. Democrats and Republicans will  have to work together if there is any chance of selling voters on the vitally  needed $18.5 billion state transportation program and reform of the Gann  spending limits. The same is true for a legislative ethics package that offers  the prospect of a pay raise in exchange for the loss of Sacramento frills, such  as speaking honorarium, that tend to to tie lawmakers too closely to big-money  lobbying groups.  </P> <P> But the list of achievements still is impressive, including a major new state  solid-waste management and recycling program, a limited ban on assault rifles  and a landmark agreement on preserving Mono Lake against water diversions to  Los Angeles. Some other significant victories overlooked in the rush toward  adjournment include Assemblyman Bruce Bronzan's (D-Fresno) Food Safety Act of  1989 that would provide Californians further protection against pesticides and  Sen. John Garamendi's (D-Walnut Grove) legislation to re-establish California's  10% solar energy tax credit.  </P> <P> All this productivity is not entirely the result of a passion for good public  policy. Both the Legislature and governor had been sharply criticized for  failing to deal with problems that were eroding the quality of California life.  Legislative leaders battled for the survival of their image and their power  positions. The governor, who is not seeking a third term, involved himself as  never before to rescue his legacy from threatened mediocrity.  </P> <P> There is no assurance that this level of bipartisan cooperation can be  sustained. It will take an active governor and an independent Legislature  willing to buck special-interest groups and campaign contributors in the  interests of the good of the whole state. The completion of a strong  legislative ethics program and campaign finance reform will help give the  lawmakers that sort of courage.  </P> <P> For now, though, the governor and lawmakers deserve to take more than a few  bows for achieving perhaps the most productive legislative record in recent  California history.  </P></p>

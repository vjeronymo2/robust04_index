			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Legacy of a laid-back American - The leaner Storehouse left by its departing chief THE DAY after his appointment as head of one of the largest department store chains in the US, Mr David Dworkin still lives up to his laid-back image. He is toying with a late lunch of baked potato, beans and coleslaw at his desk, after a work-out at the gym. But if exercise and healthy eating have helped Mr Dworkin shed quite a few pounds since he arrived from the US three years' ago to head BhS, the department store chain, a similar transformation has taken place at that company and the parent Storehouse group which he took over last summer. Mr Dworkin characterises the change thus. Storehouse when he arrived was 'amorphous, and a bit chaotic. It was non-symmetrical, a portfolio of non-related business entities.' Today, it is 'unified, focused, with the same philosophies governing the businesses.' The City seems to agree with him, and credits him with the transformation. Storehouse shares, which hit a low of 85p in December 1991, recently touched 219p. In the last two days, the jitters caused by the news of his departure have knocked almost 10 per cent off the shares, although analysts say the reaction may be overdone. Mr Dworkin, they say, has made the fundamental changes that were required, and set the company back on course. The 49-year-old American has sometimes been ruthless. To cut costs, he sacked 900 people, and got rid of the 'legions and layers, all the fluff and the nonsense,' removing four layers of management. Some functions were contracted out, old stock was sold off cheaply, and the image of BhS was rethought, with better use made of displays and space, and brighter stores. There were mistakes, but the strategy worked. Year-on-year sales increases have run at about 8 per cent for the last 16 months, and margins have also improved. Last summer, Mr Dworkin rose to head the Storehouse group. Officially, this was due to the failure of then chief executive Mr Michael Julien to throw off a lingering virus, but some accounts suggest Mr Dworkin may have been threatening a return to the US even then. The slimming down of the business continued. The Habitat and Richards chains were sold, leaving Storehouse focused on BhS and Mothercare. Mr Dworkin appointed Ms Ann Iverson, a colleague from his days at Bonwit Teller, the US stores group, to head Mothercare and introduce BhS-style reforms. The process is far from complete. Mr Dworkin claims that while Storehouse's total floorspace is 7m sq ft, 3.6m of which is selling space, 1m sq ft are 'fallow', waiting to be 'recaptured' for trading. He planned to stay at least another year. But two weeks' ago the call came from Carter Hawley Hale. The stores chain, based in the western US, had been looking for a new chief executive since last October. It was too tempting to refuse. 'The set of circumstances that appealed to me when I arrived here exist at Carter Hawley,' Mr Dworkin says. 'It's the thrill, the challenge, the excitement of having something major to accomplish. It is a bit of an ego thing.' There were also family reasons. Mr Dworkin wanted to be reunited with his two daughters in the US. Carter Hawley's 83 department stores sell fashions to furniture and household goods, under the names The Broadway, The Broadway SouthWest, Emporium and Weinstocks. The Broadway name, Mr Dworkin says, enjoys a similar reputation in California to Marks and Spencer in the UK. Rising debts, however, led the group to seek chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 1991. It began to reorganise and slim down, and emerged from chapter 11 last October with 16m sq ft of selling space, including many prime locations. The group is already profitable and has a high turnover, but is rudderless. 'Dollars 2bn sales a year without a game plan is a lot of business,' remarks Mr Dworkin. He sees his role as similar to that at Storehouse: providing leadership, removing the fat and devising a strategy. Storehouse, meanwhile, is looking in both the UK and the US for a replacement. It is stressing the need for continuity, but says the new chief is likely to come from outside the group. Mr Dworkin looks back with some satisfaction. 'I would be less than honest if I said I wasn't proud. How many managements tried to turn around BhS? It was supposed to be the poison pill.'</p>

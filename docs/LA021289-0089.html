			<p><P> February 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A PROPOSED CHILDREN'S COURT FIT FOR CHILDREN  </P> <P> For children who must be removed from their parents' care because of abuse or  neglect, proceedings in Los Angeles County Dependency Court can exacerbate the  trauma of their tumultuous home life.  </P> <P> The Dependency Court is housed in the Criminal Courts Building in downtown Los  Angeles, a facility designed for hardened lawbreakers, not frightened children.  Families waiting for their hearings often must stand in crowded, noisy  corridors outside the courtrooms.  </P> <P> The crush in the hallways has been bad enough to prompt the city fire marshal  to cite the court for being "grossly overcrowded" on the 12th floor, where  dependency hearings are held. Clerks, court reporters and counselors from the  child advocate's office are housed in makeshift offices in unventilated storage  rooms.  </P> <P> However, court officials hope that can change soon with the proposed  construction of the Los Angeles County Children's Court in Monterey Park. When  its doors open, perhaps early in 1992, the court will be unlike any other  facility in the nation.  </P> <P> "Nobody has ever built a building like this," said Frank Zolin, executive  officer of the Los Angeles County court system.  </P> <P> "This is the first time that anyone has designed a children's court where the  entire caseload would (involve) neglected and abused children (rather than  delinquents). There's nothing even similar."  </P> <P> The six-story, $45.1-million project goes before the Monterey Park City Council  for approval this week. The county Board of Supervisors will consider giving  final design and construction approval next month.  </P> <P> Assuming that the project is approved by the city and the county, ground would  be broken next year at the six-acre site on the western edge of Monterey Park,  near the junction of the Long Beach and San Bernardino freeways.  </P> <P> In stark contrast to the forbidding environs of the Criminal Courts Building,  the Children's Court would be designed to be "child sensitive," Zolin said. The  court building would include such amenities as diaper-changing rooms and  secured play areas.  </P> <P> "We will have scaled-down courtrooms that are less formal and less imposing in  an effort to reduce the trauma on the children," Zolin said. "Obviously, all  the areas that will serve the children, the waiting rooms, shelter care, will  be designed with children in mind."  </P> <P> The facility will also house all the various ancillary agencies that provide  services to children. The county Department of Children's Services, the county  counsel and the Sheriff's Department will all have office space in the  building, as will private psychiatrists and psychologists and volunteers from  the child advocate's office.  </P> <P> Children whose cases are heard in the court will also benefit from its close  proximity to Cal State Los Angeles, just across the San Bernardino Freeway.  Zolin said the university and the court will be able to develop a closer  relationship that will benefit both institutions.  </P> <P> "People now working in Dependency Court will do in-service training at the  university -- people in the county counsel, sheriff's deputies and counselors  from the Department of Children's Services," Zolin said. "Also, it will be a  learning opportunity for students from Cal State L.A. studying sociology and  social case work."  </P> <P> Cal State Los Angeles President James S. Rosser said the court would provide an  ideal setting for internships for students in the university's School of Health  and Human Services. Attorneys and counselors from the court would also be  welcome to serve as adjunct faculty at the university.  </P> <P> Zolin added that Cal State Los Angeles is a leading university in studying the  particular social problems manifested in many of the cases heard each day in  Dependency Court.  </P> <P> "Cal State L.A. is one of the up-and-coming universities in the U.S. dealing  with urban problems," Zolin said. "I believe proximity to Cal State L.A. and  this partnership is really going to enhance research into domestic violence and  child neglect."  </P> <P> Rosser said the relationship between the university and the court "fits in with  the urban-focus commitment we have as part of our mission as a university. . .  . I'm very pleased to see (the court project) coming to a positive fruition."  </P> <P> The Dependency Court was originally moved to the Criminal Courts Building on a  "temporary basis" in 1978. Since virtually its first day there, court officials  complained that a building created for criminal proceedings was not the proper  place to decide such a sensitive matter as whether a child should be removed  from his or her family.  </P> <P> "One of the classic stories is about when one of the . . . youngsters was  walking in through the front door and saw the (Criminal Courts Building) sign,"  Zolin said. "He turned to the case worker and said, 'Am I a criminal?' "  </P> <P> "The Dependency Courts should never have been located in the environment of the  Criminal Courts Building," he added. "That was an interim relocation that  lasted 11 years."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Awareness Rises  </P> <P> The inadequacies of the Criminal Courts Building were worsened in the early  1980s as the public and government agencies became more aware of child abuse.  In the 1984-85 fiscal year, the caseload at the Dependency Court rose 23%.  </P> <P> At the same time, the growing backlog of criminal cases made courtroom space  downtown a precious commodity. Superior Court judges have said that  overcrowding at the Criminal Courts Building could be eased considerably if the  Dependency Courts vacated the courtrooms on the 12th floor.  </P> <P> But the search for a new location for the Dependency Court was delayed by  disagreement among officials about location and the type of facility to be  used.  </P> <P> At one point, the favored plan was to create 20 courtrooms by remodeling the  former Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. department store in Alhambra. An additional  five courtrooms were to be housed in a satellite office in Irwindale.  Eventually, however, court officials concluded that children would be best  served in a single, new facility.  </P> <P> The idea is not without its detractors, the most influential of whom is county  Supervisor Pete Schabarum. Schabarum cast the lone opposing vote in May, 1988,  when the Board of Supervisors voted to build the Children's Court.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Reason for Opposition  </P> <P> Tom Hageman, Schabarum's assistant chief deputy, said the supervisor opposed  the project largely because he believed that the project should be coordinated  by the county Facilities Management Department, not by Zolin.  </P> <P> "There's nobody questioning the need for better Dependency Court facilities,"  Hageman said. "It's who was doing (the construction) as much as anything else."  </P> <P> Zolin said he took over the reins of the project in May, 1988, under an order  by county Chief Administrative Officer Richard B. Dixon.  </P> <P> "I accepted the responsibility of putting the project together after Mr. Dixon  made it a condition for there being a project," Zolin said, adding that  Schabarum has long opposed efforts to build a centralized Juvenile Court  facility. "Mr. Schabarum has criticized that decision by Mr. Dixon. That may  explain his opposition since May of 1988, but Mr. Schabarum has a record" of  opposing a new central Juvenile Court for 10 to 12 years, he said.  </P> <P> Schabarum's opposition was based, Zolin said, on his belief that the public  would be better served by five satellite children's courts spread throughout  the county.  </P> <P> "I'm sure Mr. Schabarum will express that opinion again when the issue is  before the supervisors" in March, Zolin said. "He favors five satellites, but  our studies clearly indicate that it's more cost-beneficial to have a  centralized program."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Opposes 'Taj Mahal'  </P> <P> Hageman said Schabarum's opposition to the project was not based primarily on  his preference for satellite courts, but added: "He thought it could be done at  less expense by not building a Taj Mahal." Schabarum has not decided whether he  will oppose the project when the board votes on its final design and  construction next month.  </P> <P> The proposal is expected to encounter little opposition from the Monterey Park  City Council at a public hearing Wednesday night. Although the project violates  a city ordinance prohibiting the construction of buildings over two stories,  council members said they see no problem with the six-story courthouse because  it will be separated by a freeway from the rest of Monterey Park.  </P> <P> "We don't see any problem with excluding it (from the height limit)," Mayor  Barry Hatch said. "We're pretty stiff on the height limit, but I think this is  an area where we can bend on it."  </P> <P> Hatch said the Children's Court project will yield social benefits to the  county and a financial return to the city. The Children's Court site was traded  by Monterey Park's Community Redevelopment Agency to the county in exchange for  land on the east side of the Long Beach Freeway, near the Los Angeles Corporate  Center.  </P> <P> Monterey Park officials had sought to attract a developer to build a hotel near  the corporate center. However, they were unable to conclude a deal for a hotel  on their original site, which was relatively inaccessible and had the Sybil  Brand Institute, the county women's jail, as a neighbor.  </P> <P> "The land (where the court is to be located) is of little value to us," Hatch  said. As a result of the land swap, he said, Monterey Park has a much better  location for a hotel and the county has an adequate site for the Children's  Court.  </P> <P> "We definitely need the court," Hatch said. "It's for children who are in  trouble, not problem children. We see it as a contribution to a great need."  </P> <P> Times staff writer Daryl Kelley contributed to this story.  </P></p>

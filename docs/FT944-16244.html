			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / Meacher presses Tories on Saudi arms The Labour party yesterday stepped up its pressure on the government over the controversial Al Yamamah defence sales package with Saudi Arabia by calling for a parliamentary inquiry into a series of big UK arms deals conducted in the 1980s. In a letter to Mr Robert Sheldon, chairman of the Commons Public Accounts Committee, Mr Michael Meacher, shadow minister for public service and open government, says that commissions claimed to have been paid in connection with Al Yamamah - including Pounds 12m allegedly to Mr Mark Thatcher, son of former prime minister Baroness Thatcher - 'were not unique events, but rather part of a general pattern which applied to other deals as well'. Enclosed with the letter is a copy of a US court document claiming that British Aerospace and Rolls-Royce had 'moved' about Dollars 4bn to an unnamed Saudi in order to influence a defence contract decision. The document refers to Saudi concerns 'about the credibility factor for the kingdom and the alleged pay-offs'. It also refers to Lady Thatcher's son. The allegations are made in the text of a confidential memorandum by an employee of the US defence group United Technologies following a visit to the Saudi capital in April 1989. The memorandum, based on a conversation with US intelligence sources, was used as evidence during a court case against the company brought by Mr Thomas Dooley, a retired US army lieutenant colonel, three years ago. Mr Dooley, who also worked for United Technologies, sued his employers after claiming that his career as an arms salesman was destroyed after he raised questions about alleged bribes. Lady Thatcher has once again denied any impropriety in the Pounds 20bn Al Yamamah contract which she helped to win while prime minister. Speaking on Wednesday night at the Southern Methodist University in Dallas, Texas, Lady Thatcher rejected a suggestion that her son had profited from the arms deal. 'I'm quite satisfied that the contract was properly negotiated,' she said, as many in the audience booed to show their support for Lady Thatcher. Earlier in the day Lady Thatcher had visited her son's Dallas home although it is not clear whether he was there to meet her. An aide to Lady Thatcher rejected suggestions that her health had been affected by the allegations about her son.</p>

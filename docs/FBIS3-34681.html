The report says that the leaflets denounced tyrant Saddam's  continued control of the ruling process and his execution of the  officers who took part or were suspected of taking part in the  coup attempt. The leaflets also urged the citizens to boycott  the ruling regime, declare disobedience, refuse to carry out  orders, and avoid joining the unfair ruling party. They  threatened further armed operations against the regime's  henchmen, associates, and institutions.</p>

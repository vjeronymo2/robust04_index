			<p>921124 FT  24 NOV 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report Trading on the London Metal Exchange was dominated by an afternoon surge in ALUMINIUM prices prompted by news that a 400,000 tonnes-a-year smelter in Tajikistan was in imminent danger of closing. The three months delivery price closed at Dollars 1,196.50 a tonne, up Dollars 10 from Friday's close, and moved on to Dollars 1,206 a tonne in after hours trading. Dealers were waiting to see if the move above Dollars 1,200 a tonne would attract overnight US or Far East selling similar to that encountered when the market tested that level two week's ago. NICKEL prices were also firm in the morning, continuing the recovery that began in the middle of last week. The market drifted in the afternoon, however, and the three months price, which had touched Dollars 5,650 a tonne, closed at Dollars 5,527.50, up Dollars 50 on the day and Dollars 175 above the 5-year low reached last Tuesday. GOLD fell in the morning on Swiss selling and long liquidation and closed Dollars 2 down on the day at Dollars 334.35 a troy ounce. Compiled from Reuters</p>

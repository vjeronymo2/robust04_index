			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / Owners Abroad fights off hostile bid: Attempted takeover by Airtours thwarted by Thomas Cook's 'spoiling action' OWNERS Abroad, the UK's second largest holiday tour operator, yesterday narrowly fought off the hostile Pounds 290m bid from rival Airtours after one of the closest takeover battles the City has seen in recent years. The outcome was only decided yesterday after Gartmore, a 7.6 per cent shareholder in Owners Abroad and a strong early supporter of the Airtours bid, switched its allegiance to the defender at the last moment. Thomas Cook, the German-controlled travel agency which will now forge a commercial tie-up with Owners Abroad, also proved decisive. Yesterday, Thomas Cook increased its stake to 8.37 per cent. At 1pm when the offer closed, Airtours had received acceptances from shareholders representing 35.18 per cent of Owners' shares. Airtours continued to buy shares yesterday morning, taking its stake in Owners Abroad to 8.2 per cent. Thomas Cook is expected to end up with a 17.8 per cent stake in Owners Abroad. Last week Thomas Cook said it would tender for up to 12.5 per cent of Owners' shares at 150p. Owners' shares fell yesterday from 138p to 126p. Owners Abroad's share register will also include Mercury Asset Management, the 15 per cent shareholder that supported Airtours' bid. Owners' defence of its independence was welcomed by many in the holiday industry who were angry when the Secretary of State for industry did not refer the bid to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. 'The market has done the job that the Secretary of State failed to do,' said Mr Noel Josephides, chairman of the Association of Independent Tour Operators. The small operators had warned they could be forced out of business by a price war that Thomson, the market leader in the UK, would have launched had Airtours won. Mr David Crossland, Airtours chairman, said he was disappointed Thomas Cook's 'spoiling action' had carried the day. Some 43 per cent of Owners' shareholders had sold to Airtours or accepted the offers, he said. 'As the largest independent customer of Air 2000 (Owners charter airline) and now one of the largest shareholders in Owners Abroad, we shall be watching developments at the company closely,' Mr Crossland said.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Christopher Munnion report: "Inkatha Told Poll </F> Boycott is Danger to South Africa"]    [Text] Johannesburg--President de Klerk warned Chief  Buthelezi and his Inkatha Freedom Party yesterday that their  refusal to participate in South Africa's democratic elections  could lead to the same "tragic events" that befell  Bophuthatswana.    In a series of speeches, Mr de Klerk said he had spoken on  the telephone to Chief Buthelezi, the KwaZulu leader, reminding  him that the people of his semi-autonomous state had the right  to vote in the elections.    The Inkatha decision not to participate in the election  created a dangerous situation for the whole country, he said.    An angry Mr Buthelezi, whose Inkatha party failed to  register  candidates by the weekend deadline, said Mr Lucas Mangope, the  Bophuthatswana leader, had been deposed illegally, betrayed by  Pretoria and the ANC [African National Congress].    "What they did to Bophuthatswana they want to do to  KwaZulu,"  he said. "All I can say is that KwaZulu is not Bophuthatswana."    The exchange between the two leaders served to switch the  focus to KwaZulu as a possible flashpoint for further  pre-election violence. Mr Buthelezi's mood cannot have been  helped by rumours that senior members of Inkatha were  considering defection to Mr de Klerk's National Party.    Dr Ben Ngubane, an Inkatha executive member, fuelled the  rumours when he said that Inkatha could still participate in  next month's elections. "Last Friday's deadline is immaterial  as to whether we decide to participate in the elections," he  said in Durban.    Inkatha's internal problems were only a small part of the  fractures in the Freedom Alliance, the improbable grouping of  white Rightwing parties and conservative homeland leaders .    Gen Constand Viljoen, the former South African military  commander, resigned from the Freedom Alliance after registering  his Freedom Front party for the elections.    At a hastily-convened meeting of the Alliance in the  northern  Cape city of Kimberley yesterday, Mr Mangope arrived to declare  that he still considered himself the legal leader of  Bophuthatswana. He said he was considering legal action against  Pretoria. If nothing else, his presence at the meeting ended  speculation that he was under some form of house arrest.    Dr Ferdi Hartzenberg, leader of the Conservative Party, said  "a communist revolution" had taken place in Bophuthatswana. The  events there had proved to all that Mr de Klerk could not be  trusted, he said.    The extremists on the Right were conspicuous by their  absence. The neo-Nazi AWB [Afrikaner Resistance Movement], in  particular, was licking its wounds after several hundred of its  members were routed. Armed and uniformed AWB men had converged  on Mmabatho, the Bophuthatswana capital, last week, ostensibly  to support Mr Mangope's tottering administration.    They were internationally humiliated when three of their  number were shot dead by Bophuthatswana police-two executed by a  policeman as they pleaded for their lives.    Even so, Mr Eugene Terreblanche, the AWB leader, called a  press conference in his home town and "Afrikaner heartland" of  Ventersdorp in the western Transvaal yesterday. He declared his  movement's intervention in the Bophuthatswana crisis "a shining  victory".    Another white extremist group, the Boerekommando, under its  fanatical "commandant", Mr Willem Ratte, occupied an historic  but derelict fort at Wonderboom north of Pretoria at the  weekend, declaring they would "hold out to the death".    They were still occupying the fort last night, despite being  given assurances by the police and the Pretoria city council  that they would be totally ignored as the area was remote,  little used by the public and of "no significance whatsoever".</p>

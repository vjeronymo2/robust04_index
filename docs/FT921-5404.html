			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / Survey of European Finance and Investment, Portugal (11): Decisive step forward THE MID-ATLANTIC archipelago of the Azores is following in Madeira's footsteps by launching a free trade zone and offshore centre based on the island of Santa Maria. Companies that set up there benefit from conditions similar to those in Madeira, such as a zero tax rate and EC membership as well as cash grants covering a large proportion of investment costs. The project took a decisive step forward in June 1991 with the final ratification by the EC and the central Portuguese government of the Azores' application to add an offshore financial and services centre to the free zone. Santa Maria was chosen as the base for the free zone mainly because of the availability of surplus manpower and infrastructures after the island's airport, once a key transatlantic refuelling point, lost importance with the advent of long-range aircraft. Large investments have since upgraded the airport for the use of companies operating in the free zone. A port has been built and telecommunications are being modernized to provide high quality telephone, computer and satellite communications by 1993. The free zone covers an area of more than 400,000 square metres. Modern offices and warehouse space is rented to companies until they build their own facilities. However, investors are not limited to setting up in the designated area of Santa Maria. Companies can seek authorisation to establish production facilities anywhere in the nine-island Azores archipelago and still enjoy all the benefits of the free zone, apart from a 20 per cent reduction in some incentives. The benefits for companies operating within the ambit of the zone include exemption from corporate and personal taxation until 2012; exemption from customs duties and local taxes; free repatriation of funds, dividends and capital gains; low company registration fees; and grants of up to 100 per cent of the cost of training workers and 50 per cent of the cost of renting land and buildings, construction, industrial installation and the purchase of equipment and machinery. Two companies already working in the zone have installed plants in Sao Miguel Island. One taps the island's forestry resources to produce industrial wood products; the other restores and exports classic cars. A third company, takes full advantage of training grants to provide courses for computer technicians and will recruit the best students for its own production plant in the Santa Maria free zone. At least 12 other companies are preparing to set up in the zone amid growing global interest. 'Santa Maria is proving particularly attractive to companies from Australia, China, Macao and other Asian countries who are looking for an entry to Europe,' says Joao Gago da Camara, the head of Sociedade de Desenvolvimento da Zona Franca Mariense (Zofram), the company that runs the zone on a concessionary basis. For classification of the origin of products, production in the zone is divided into Portuguese, European and non-European classes. Normal international quota limits apply to exports from the zone, depending on the level of European or other content. However, Zofram hopes to establish specific agreements with regions, including Europe and the United States, to waive the application of quota restrictions on goods from the zone as an added stimulus to the development of the Azores.</p>

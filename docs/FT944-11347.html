			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / Business Travel: The hard trail to post-sanctions Iraq - Tips for the business optimist Visiting Baghdad is still not easy. It takes an arduous 12- to 14-hour drive from Amman to get there. Hotels are stripped of the least luxury. Doing business in anything but food and medicines requires approval from the stern UN sanctions committee. How much money Iraq's government has to pay for things is a matter of doubt. And the post-sanctions atmosphere in the Middle East's most oppressively policed state is not festive. None of this, however, has deterred coachloads of French, Italian, Russian, Turkish, Canadian and even a few hardy British businessmen from making the trip - all preparing for the day when the shackle of sanctions is unlocked from what, before the Gulf war, was among the region's richest markets. So, some tips for dogged optimists: All non-Arab visitors require a visa to get into Baghdad, which is more than a formality given Iraq's lack of diplomatic relations with most western countries, whose governments mostly discourage all visits to Iraq. Iraq's embassy in Amman is well used to processing journalists' visas, and might be worth calling directly for information on business passes. Visa approval takes time. Most countries also have an Iraqi interest section in a 'neutral' local embassy. In Baghdad itself, US and British interests are represented by the Polish and Russian embassies, for instance. Once a visa is approved, travellers will need to start their journey in Jordan. There is then no alternative but to travel the Amman-Baghdad desert highway, which takes a minimum of 12 hours if you are lucky enough to take only an hour crossing the border. But be warned: it can take several hours to cross. Taxis can easily be hired in Amman - for instance through the Intercontinental Hotel - and prices vary with demand and bargaining abilities. But count on paying around Dollars 250 per one-way trip in one of the numerous big GMC Suburban taxis which ply the route. Saloon cars are cheaper, but 12 cramped hours is a long, long drive. In Iraq itself, travel by day if possible, for diplomats warn against driving anywhere in Iraq by night and travellers have been robbed and killed on the Amman-Baghdad road recently. Crossing the border is relatively straight-forward, but those taking personal computers should have them marked on the entry visa. An 'Aids test' (ie, a means of relieving foreigners of Dollars 50) at the border is obligatory, so equip yourself with sterilised needles. If you are lucky, and you or your driver are savvy enough, the 'Aids test' can be circumvented by a small 'gift' at the border. A pack of Marlboros might suffice, and are a good thing to have about you at all times. In Baghdad, all main hotels are operating, and the al-Rasheed (as seen on CNN), the Meridien and Sheraton all offer rooms at Dollars 100 a night plus a small Iraq dinar charge for obligatory breakfast - usually an anaemic omelette. Food is in critically short supply in Iraq, and hotels and restaurants offer meagre fare, so it is worth stocking up on food and drinks before leaving. Such goods would be gratefully accepted by Iraqi business partners. All substantial bills can be met in US dollars, but it is worth changing some into Iraqi dinars. And forget credit cards. Swap Dollars 100 at first, which will produce enough low-denomination dinars to stuff a briefcase. By the time you leave you will be able to count notes with the dexterity of a bank-teller, for in hyper-inflationary Baghdad even paying a restaurant bill will remind you of playing Monopoly. Not that Baghdad's once-buzzing restaurants are what they were. The shortage of food and a recent ban on public drinking has plunged the city's best eateries into sad, deserted gloom. The al-Diwan 'Chinese' restaurant, with Tunisian cook, at the al-Hamra hotel still manages a cheap, passable but tiny-portioned meal. The al-Mudeef restaurant on the Tigris corniche is also worth trying, and highly picturesque, but when I drew the waiters' attention to a big rat contentedly weaving through the feet of customers on its way to the kitchen, they barely shrugged. Beware, too, the once cheap and cheerful Tigris-side fish restaurants. It is still possible to choose a tasty-looking live fish to grill, but UN experts in Baghdad warn that they are more than usually nourished these days on fecal matter poured into the river, so chase your meal down with some immodium. Getting around Baghdad is no problem. Each hotel has plenty of over-attentive taxi drivers who will charge Dollars 50 a day. Many of them live in the big hotels, and are keen to act as guides. They will not prove the most critical or independent observers of Iraq's political system, but this is not a topic you should try to discuss. It might also prove highly risky to take up these drivers' offers to change money at black-market rates. No foreign visitor will go anywhere, do anything or meet anyone without being closely watched or reported upon. Communications with the outside world are also a problem, unless you have access to a satellite telephone. Most business locals telex home base for a call-back, which usually comes through to the main hotels quickly and readily. Overseas calls from the big hotels can be booked, but take hours. All of which compounds the mood of cheerless isolation which descends swiftly on visitors to Baghdad. Day trips can alleviate things: Babylon is an hour away by taxi, for example. And there are shopping opportunities for those with a strong enough heart to buy fine carpets and silver from locals who need money to buy food. However, rigorous customs checks when you are leaving mean you might lose your purchases without recourse. If none of this deters you - the best of luck.</p>

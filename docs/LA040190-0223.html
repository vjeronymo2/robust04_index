			<p><P> April 1, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMPENSATE INNOCENTS IN HARM'S WAY;  </P> <P> PANAMA: CIVILIANS WERE PART OF THE CASUALTY EQUATION AS U.S. TROOPS WENT IN.  THEY SHOULD NOT BE IGNORED AS THE TROOPS LEAVE.  </P> <P> On Jan. 25, President Bush announced a $1-billion package of aid for the  reconstruction of Panama that consists of grants, loans and trade benefits.  Guillermo Endara, the new president of Panama, responded with thanks and muted  remarks that Panama needs more -- smiles and good will all around.  </P> <P> No one is smiling in Santo Tomas, Panama City's municipal hospital. Dimly lit  hallways open to crowded wards that smell of equal parts disinfectant, human  waste and stale blood. The beds, two feet apart, are all full. The people are  quiet. Some lack a limb or two. Some are in traction. All are in bandages.  These are the flotsam of our invasion of Panama. Civilians who were unlucky  enough to get in the way. Most are from the poor neighborhoods where the  heaviest fighting occurred. They may know about President Bush's relief  package, but none expect their own government to turn it into meaningful relief  for them.  </P> <P> Some examples:  </P> <P> Maricela McFarland was asleep in Chorillo with her three daughters when the  assault on the nearby Comandancia began. She was leading them out of her house  when a shard of shrapnel took a pound of her thigh and all but tore off her  2-year-old daughter's foot.  </P> <P> Ernesto Cubilla was drinking water in his kitchen at 8 o'clock on the morning  of the invasion. A helicopter gunship strafing Dignity Battalion members nearby  sent a stray round through his roof. The oldest of his five children, his  18-year-old son, rushed in to find him splayed in the corner. He lost a lung  and a kidney and suffered liver damage.  </P> <P> Heriberto Pitti had worked for Eastern Airlines for 19 years. He was on the  night shift as a cargo agent at the Eastern hangar when our troops attacked the  airport. Pitti, Pablo Diaz and another colleague jumped into an Eastern pickup  and raced out of the hangar. The truck took seven rounds through the  windshield, killing all three men. Pitti left a widow and two daughters; Diaz  left a widow and 12 children.  </P> <P> These are not isolated cases. Although the number of dead noncombatants has  been listed at 202, unofficial tolls are higher. The wounded outnumber the  dead.  </P> <P> Combat in densely populated areas is nothing new, but Panama is not Vietnam or  Germany of 1945. As a people and as a government -- except during the latter  part of Manuel A. Noriega's leadership -- Panama has been friendly toward the  United States for all of its nearly 90 years as a nation. Through construction  and management of the canal, America and Panama have developed a unique  interdependence. For decades, Panamanians and Americans have lived, worked and  raised families together.  </P> <P> The invasion of Panama was well planned and executed. Nonetheless, many of the  military targets were in thickly settled areas. Planners must have expected  heavy civilian casualties. These casualties were part of the equation as our  troops went in and they should not be ignored as our troops leave.  </P> <P> The proposed aid package is a generous show of support to Panama's new  government. It won't, however, help the individuals who need and deserve help,  too. The package is designed primarily to alleviate Panama's foreign debt, fund  government-reconstruction programs and provide low-interest loans and trade  benefits to Panama's businesses. It includes no compensation for innocent  victims of the invasion. Even if did, though, it would be unfair to burden  Panama's new government with the task.  </P> <P> The United States should compensate the innocent people who can substantiate  claims of injury or loss from the invasion. We decided to invade. We should  attend to the actual victims.  </P> <P> This would not be without precedent. The United States has compensated the  innocent victims of our combat in the Dominican Republic after the invasion of  1965 and in Grenada after the invasion of 1983. In the Dominican Republic and  again in Grenada, the U.S. Army established a field office solely to adjudicate  and pay claims from invasion victims. Claims attorneys for the Army have the  training to substantiate losses and ensure that claims are, in fact, for  innocent noncombatants.  </P> <P> The United States should not overlook the human element in Panama's recovery --  especially after our political, material and human investment in making it safe  for democracy.  </P></p>

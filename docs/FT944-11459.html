			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / Books: Dying falls, abrupt endings - Short Stories Reading as though written en bloc, the tales in Carol Shields' Various Miracles (Fourth Estate, Pounds 9.99) are united by a common fascination with the giddy euphorics of chance. Her wry voice captures moments of transcendence, accidental beauties mimicking the quirks of human reminiscence. The image of a wedding ring is swept up with the memory of a childhood vision, a revelation of religious faith and fresh perception of married harmony. She shows the process by which scraps of real lives are transmuted into poetry or anecdotes. A loving testimony to the slow, unspoken bargains of lasting marriage, Shields' work here is shot through with honest awe. Jane Gardam's fiction is made of darker stuff. Going Into a Dark House (Sinclair Stevenson, Pounds 14.99) is spiced with mortality. She specialises in abrupt endings where Shields favours the dying fall. Her evocations of place and mood are vivid, the loving detail she lavishes on land, language and food, intensely English. Here are tough tales of lost innocence and shattered hopes. Gardam writes particularly well about the ambivalence of mother love. Mothers look with disdain on the children they have produced, daughters regard their parents with cowed, rebellious glowers. There is humour too, most memorably in Telegony, an historical novella of whale-boned passion in Edwardian Shipley; blissfully funny at first, then oddly moving. Salman Rushdie is a word gourmet, piling epithet on epithet, clause on sickly descriptive clause. In the broader plane of a novel, this pays off richly; apparently gratuitous word eruptions and extra-narrative excursions make a vital contribution to a work's vigour. In miniature, however, the effect can prove clogging. Two tales here, Yorrick and At the Auction of the Ruby Slippers grind almost to a halt under the weight of Rushdie's galumphing irony. At its best, however, East, West (Cape, Pounds 9.99) shows him on extraordinary form. His strongest spells are cast when he curbs his wilder gestures and dares to gauze over his strong personality with the deceptively plain tale he is unfurling. The three unpredictable Eastern fables typify this restraint. Lovely, too, is The Courtier, a fond homage to Certainly Mary, a redoubtable family ayah. Uprooted and set adrift in Sixties Kensington, she finds backstairs romance and an unexpected aptitude for grandmaster chess technique before choosing to return to her roots. While much of the piece's humour arises from the zany cross-cultural influences that are the collection's theme, Mary's maintenance of her dignity in the face of her westernised charges' mockery stands as a decorous reproof. The stories in Carol Lake's Switchboard Operators (Bloomsbury, Pounds 12.99) are so unified in characters and setting that this beguiling book can almost be read as a novel. Set amid the rarefied procedures, clattering machinery and sex war skirmishes of the Derby telephone exchange in 1969, the narratives are as meticulously researched as those in her first work, Rosehill, so that the book glows with documentary insights. Lake's narrator is Sylvie, a newcomer to the institution, following in her mother's footsteps. Less interested in Post Office regulatory procedure than in following boyfriends to man the Revolution's barricades, Sylvie is a deeply poignant figure. Less bright than she thinks she is and given to drink, she is, one gradually perceives, barely a twin-set's reach from a psychiatric ward. That the undertow of sadness is never allowed to swell up into tragedy is typical of Lake's cunning. As much a specialist in the field as VS Pritchett, Alice Munro stands alone in this batch in writing stories which, for all their brevity, evince such complex emotional references and depth of character that each reads like a miraculously compressed novel. For this very reason, it is impossible to read Open Secrets (Chatto &amp; Windus, Pounds 14.99) back-to-back - one has to keep laying the book aside to live each tale a little in one's head. Ranging in their settings from the 1850s to the present, from Canada to the Balkans, they are united by an undertow of violence and by the restlessness of their heroines - each a pioneer in her way. Like the best styles, Munro's is invisible. Inexorable and precise as the slowest cogs in a clock mechanism, her narratives seem so weighted with imminence and induce an often quite needless sense of dread.</p>

In 1990 the city ecological fund account received R760,000,  in 1991--R12.6 million, in 1992--R28.7 million, and in  1993--R93.3 million.    The resources were spent on city environmental protection  measures in accordance with the plan approved at meetings of the  city ecological soviet and the deputy commission for ecology and  the protection of the health of the population.    In particular: On conducting radiological surveys and  decontaminating polluted sectors, on sanitizing Lake Kaban and  other reservoirs of the city, on developing TerKSOP [Territorial  Comprehensive Environmental Protection Plan], on the  technical-economic account of the plant for utilizing everyday  and industrial wastes, on constructing a unit to remove the  mercury from mercury lamps, and on other matters.    In 1993 computations were conducted for payments by 652  large  enterprises and organizations of the city (1990--52; 1991--168;  1992--226).    Coordination of the activity in the sphere of environmental  protection is ensured by the city ecological council. A  scientific-technical expert council and a laboratory council  were established under the city ecological council.    Monitoring compliance with environmental protection  legislation by wildlife managers is carried out by the Central  Territorial Administration of the Ministry of Environmental  Protection and Natural Resources of Tatarstan, the city and  rayon centers of Gossanepidnadzor [State Sanitation and  Epidemiologic Inspectorate], two environmental protection  procuracies, and the sanitary-ecological militia of the  Directorate of Internal Affairs of Kazan.

			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / Manufacturing blow to recovery hopes MANUFACTURING output fell in each of the latter two quarters of last year, according to government statistics issued yesterday which do little to support hopes of a recov-ery. The output of all production industries, including manufacturing, energy and water, dropped last year for the third year running - the first time that this has happened since the early 30s. The seasonally adjusted data indicate that manufacturing production, which accounts for just under a quarter of the economy, has yet to show any significant rebound from its trough during the re-cession in the fourth quarter of 1991. During 1992 production by the sector was down 0.8 per cent compared with the previous year. That followed a 5.2 per cent annual fall in 1991 and one of 0.5 per cent the previous year. Last year output of mineral products, metals and mechanical goods dropped in each case by more than 4 per cent compared with 1991, while food, chemicals and artificial fibres all experienced an output increase of more than 1 per cent. In the last quarter of last year manufacturing volumes were down 0.2 per cent compared with the previous quarter that came after a 0.1 per cent drop between the second and third three-month periods. Manufacturing saw a provisional rise in production of 0.1 per cent in December compared with November. In the three months between October and December last year output by the manufacturing sector was up by just 0.4 per cent compared with the low point for the sector a year previously. In the fourth quarter, aided by a 6.3 per cent quarterly jump in North Sea oil and gas extraction, output of all production industries was 0.9 per cent up on the previous three months. But for the year as a whole, output by these industries, which account for just over one third of gross domestic product, was down 0.4 per cent compared with the previous 12 months. The sector registered year-on-year falls of 3 per cent and 0.6 per cent respectively in 1991 and 1990. In the fourth quarter of last year car production was down 4.9 per cent compared with the previous three months. Over the same period the metals, artificial fibres and mineral-products industries registered quarterly production falls of 7.1 per cent, 4.9 per cent and 3.6 per cent respectively. Output of chemicals and electrical products increased by a quarterly 3.1 per cent in both cases.</p>

			<p>931011 FT  11 OCT 93 / Arts: Jamais Vu, Always mad - Theatre At the start of his one-man show Jamais Vu at the Cottesloe Theatre, Ken Campbell scans the National Theatre's programme to check what he is supposed to be doing. While the David Hare trilogy continues at the Olivier Theatre, Campbell's own remarkable trilogy can be seen on Saturday 23 October at the Cottesloe. After all, he opened the theatre in 1977 with the eight-hour Illuminatus. Jamais Vu feels like the third leg of a quadruped. Its forerunners are Recollections of a Furtive Nudist (1988) and Pigspurt (1992). The shows are made up of personal stories which Campbell says he dare not tell his friends: 'But it seems all right if people have paid.' Recollections led Campbell into a case of 'enchanted vanishment' tracking down a vanishee from King's Cross to St John's, Newfoundland; Pigspurt led him on a sociobiological quest based on the shape of his nose. Campbell's style is perplexing, infuriating and refreshing; sometimes hilarious, often scatological, and always mad. It is no accident he went to school in Barking. His contribution to British theatre is radical and immense, including a 22-hour show at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London and the Science Fiction Theatre of Liverpool; and he has portrayed lunacy in other media, from The Hitchhiker's Guide on radio to The Madness Museum on television. Quintessential Campbell is a dizzying monologue which defies gravity before toppling into itself; add the twitching right foot, the eyebrows like elevators and the nasal twang of his voice, and Campbell materialises. In Jamais Vu the he uses a sink plunger to model his narrative. This is nowhere near as fine of funny as its precursors, but it does deviate into sense and wit. The impossible story turns on a notice outside the hut of Chief Jack Naira of Tanna in the South Pacific: We believe that Prince Pilip (sic) is originally of Tanna and we want him to return home. This information takes Campbell to the Uxbridge Secure Unit to talk to a member of the Ice Age elite, then to discrepant paperback and hardback versions of a Prince Philip biography and on to a world of bicycle clips and Pidgin English: What-name you-me makim someting? or 'What shall we do?' En route he stops for the occasional apercu: judges are law students who get to mark their own exams; 'Guardian columnist' David Mellor has 'the look of perhaps going to be witty in a minute'; and John Birt of the BBC is 'an alien inadequately briefed, a man with a talent for retrospective absence'. The deconstructive chaos is deftly scripted, patterned and now published. Campbell's brilliance is his bravery and his disregard for what others think of his kind of intelligence. Colin Watkeys tries to direct. 'Jamais Vu' is at the Cottesloe Theatre (071 928 2252) on October 13, 14, and 22. 'Furtive Nudist', 'Pigspurt'and 'Jamais Vu' are at the Cottesloe on October 23. 'Jamais Vu' is also at the Riverside Studios (081 7483354) from November 3-23</p>

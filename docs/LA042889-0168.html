			<p><P> April 28, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NO CAUSE FOUND FOR CRASH OF GUARD JET  </P> <P> An investigation of the crash of a California Air National Guard jet fighter  that killed two officers in 1987 failed to establish the cause of the mishap,  the Legislature was told Thursday.  </P> <P> The probe by the state auditor general, an investigative arm of the  Legislature, was ordered by the Senate last year after charges by the widow of  one victim that the National Guard and Air Force had "covered up" the  circumstances of the accident.  </P> <P> The Senate told the auditor general to examine aircraft maintenance, air crew  training and flight safety activities of the Air Guard's 144th Fighter  Interceptor Wing at Fresno, where the F-4 jet and its crew was assigned.  </P> <P> However, Kurt R. Sjoberg, acting auditor general, said in his report to the  Legislature that although certain records were made available to his  inspectors, the report on the Air Force's own investigation of the accident was  withheld and other key documents were routinely destroyed.  </P> <P> Air Force officials, Sjoberg said, declined to give a reason for withholding  the accident report, invoking "executive privilege."  </P> <P> Killed in the low-altitude maneuver over the desert in Arizona in June, 1987,  were the pilot, Capt. Wesley Deane, 27, of Modesto, and the weapons officer,  Maj. John Jordan Jr., 39, of Sacramento.  </P> <P> Jordan's widow, Toni, had waged an eight-month effort to learn details of the  crash.  </P> <P> She said the Air Guard had ignored recommendations for reform of its management  and safety procedures made before the crash that killed her husband. She  contended that if the recommendations had been implemented the crash might not  have occurred.  </P> <P> Mrs. Jordan said the Air Guard has refused to acknowledge the existence of a  document she managed to obtain independently. It showed, she said, that  although the pilot was qualified to fly the F-4, his training records had been  falsified to indicate that he also was qualified to make the type of tricky  high-speed, low-altitude maneuver she said he was making at the time of the  crash.  </P> <P> The auditor general's report, based in part on documents made available by the  Air Guard, confirmed that "the pilot logged into his training records  low-altitude training events that he did not actually fly" so as to make it  appear he was qualified to do so.  </P> <P> Sjoberg said records dealing with flight safety, training and aircraft  maintenance before the flight had been routinely destroyed in accordance with  Air Force rules and that the records "that did exist were either not available  to us or were not complete enough for us to review."  </P></p>

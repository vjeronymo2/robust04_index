			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Gilt repos Some in the gilt market were expecting the Chancellor to announce the creation of an 'open repo' market yesterday. So there was mild disappointment when he only announced a consultation exercise. Even so, the Bank of England's consultation process looks a formality. Investors should soon be able to borrow and lend government bonds freely. The gilts market will then enjoy greater liquidity and investors will find it easier to go short. A parallel review by the Inland Revenue is expected to lead to interest on gilts being paid gross of tax. Meanwhile, the Treasury's current examination of government debt arrangements could result in a more streamlined gilts issuing process. All in all, by the middle of next year, the UK will probably sport a thoroughly modern government bond market tailored to the needs of investors. Such reforms carry possible dangers. If the government takes risks with inflation, speculators will find it easier to punish it by selling gilts short. But provided a firm line on inflation is maintained, the government will benefit by shaving a few basis points off the cost of public funding.</p>

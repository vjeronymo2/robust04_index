			<p><P> December 6, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SACRAMENTO;  </P> <P> SUIT SEEKS TO HALT RANCHO SECO CLOSURE  </P> <P> A lawsuit filed in Sacramento Superior Court seeks to halt the decommissioning  of the Rancho Seco nuclear power plant until effects of the shutdown on the  environment are determined. The suit contends that closing the plant will  worsen air pollution in the Central Valley because of the need for gas-fired  plants and other sources to replace Rancho Seco's power generation. The suit  was filed on behalf of UC Davis radiobiology professor Marvin Goldman, Daniel  St. Croix, a nuclear licensing consultant, and David Freeman, a nuclear physics  student at Davis. Closing the plant, the suit said, "will cause significant  incremental emissions of carbon dioxide, other gases and particulate matter,  all of which are injurious to health, and which will accelerate the 'greenhouse  effect,' lead to 'acid rain' and may have other serious adverse environmental  effects." Meanwhile, the Sacramento Municipal Utility District will continue to  decommission the plant as required by a ratepayers' vote last June to close the  facility.  </P></p>

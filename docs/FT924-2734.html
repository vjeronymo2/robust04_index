			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / Japanese budget bill becomes law A crucial budget bill to stimulate Japan's sluggish economy became law yesterday after clearing a final hurdle in the upper house of parliament, Reuter reports from Tokyo. The Y2,070bn (Pounds 11bn) supplementary budget, approved by the lower house 10 days ago, was passed just before parliament was due to close. Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, prime minister, had been under pressure to win approval of the budget, some of which will go towards implementing the Y10,700bn emergency economic package.</p>

			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report London COCOA prices pulled back from earlier two-month highs. Dealers said the market was active but unable to sustain an early advance above Pounds 600 a tonne for the September contract, relinquishing some of the gains to profit taking and technical selling. The market now needs a period of technical consolidation. There was also a lack of manufacturer interest which, if maintained, leaves the market vulnerable to origin selling, dealers said. New York arabica COFFEE futures were sharply down at midday amid speculation that producers who did not sell before last month's ICO meeting would soon return to the market. Most base metals were easing at the close on the LME after Comex COPPER quickly lost its post-holiday gains, undermining prices in London. Traders said that as a large part of the recent rise in base metals had been due to expectations of a recovery in the US economy, the performance of the Comex copper contract was being watched closely by traders in all metals. GOLD and PLATINUM pushed higher in modest trade on the London bullion market with an upbeat, but cautious resumption of US trading after Friday's holiday. Compiled from Reuters</p>

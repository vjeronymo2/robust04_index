			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, May 25 (XINHUA) -- U.S. State Secretary  Warren Christopher met with Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on  Peres at the State Department today.    "They had an extensive review of the state of play and all  four of the tracks of the Middle East peace process," Department  Spokesman Mike McCurry said at a regular news briefing.    They reviewed the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho  Agreement and discussed some of the multilateral negotiations,  McCurry said.    After meeting with Christopher about 50 minutes, Peres had a  working lunch with Undersecretary Peter Tarnoff and some other  officials.    Peres and Tarnoff discussed a range of global issues such as  democratization efforts around the world, some aspects of the  new U.S. criteria on participation in U.N. peacekeeping and  non-proliferation, according to McCurry.    They also discussed "East Asia as a region and some efforts  that we both have in common as we pursue interests in East  Asia," he said.    Asked about recent statement by Palestine Liberation  Organization Chairman Yasir 'Arafat on "holy war," McCurry said  that "the important thing is that the parties need to talk to  each other and not surprise each other."    He also said they need to keep the commitments that they  have  made to each other and to use the consultative mechanism that  they have established to resolve any questions that arise.</p>

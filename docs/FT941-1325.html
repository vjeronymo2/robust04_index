			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Anglian Water expands in US Anglian Water, the privatised UK utility, yesterday stepped up its presence in the US, with the Dollars 27m (Pounds 18.4m) cash purchase of a California-based membrane technology company. Fluid Systems, sold by US conglomerate Allied Signal, will have net assets of Dollars 6m after completion. It is Anglian's second purchase in the US. It follows last year's acquisition of a small Massachusetts-based company through the purchase of Nordic Water, the Swedish process engineering group. Mr Andy Nield, finance director of Anglian Water Process engineering, said the group had sought access to the technology in the UK, but this had proved difficult. The process, which uses a cloth membrane to separate impurities from water, was more advanced and in greater demand in the US, he said. 'We see the technology will be increasingly important in the future,' he said. Anglian intended to expand Fluid Systems' client base through its operations in Scandinavia, France, Germany and Australia. Fluid Systems last year made a pre-tax profit of Dollars 2.3m on sales of Dollars 18.6m.</p>

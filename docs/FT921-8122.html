			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee prices tumble ARABICA COFFEE prices tumbled in New York in early trading yesterday to the lowest levels for 17 years as traders returned from the Presidents' Day holiday, writes David Blackwell. At midday the nearby contract was off 2.5 cents at 66.60 cents a lb. The London robusta market also closed sharply down, with the second position contract shedding a further Dollars 23 to a new low of Dollars 851 a tonne. Mr Lawrence Eagles, analyst with GNI, the London futures brokers, said that most market watchers were now revising upwards their crop forecasts for this year. Last week Colombia, the second biggest producer, revised its estimate for the 1991-92 crop up from 16m bags (60 kg each) to 16.7m bags, another record. 'The only thing that can push prices up now is a crop disaster or an International Coffee Organisation accord,' said Mr Eagles. Stop-loss selling by funds and commission houses are pushing New York into 'a bottomless pit,' one trader said. 'Eventually it will reach such a level that producers will be forced into action.' Earlier this month an ICO working party failed to agree on any move towards re-establishing a coffee pact with economic clauses. The ICO export quota system collapsed in July 1989.</p>

We also appreciate efforts by  France, and its president, Francois Mitterrand, to help Ukraine  destroy nuclear weapons as well as develop its nuclear power  engineering system and liquidate the consequences of the  Chernobyl nuclear power plant accident.    Following the meeting with the president, most of which was  held without media representatives, the guest answered questions  from journalists. In particular, he emphasized that in his  opinion, there are no differences between the French and  Ukrainian points of view on the danger of instability on our  continent. We, Alain Lamassoure declared, are for a Europe  serving as the center of peace, stability, and prosperity so  that relations among states are based on equality, democratic  principles, and friendship, and so that there are no blocs  forming on European territory. France itself, the guest  continued, came up with an initiative to hold a conference on  problems of stability and security in Europe, at which  representatives of those countries could discuss these problems.  [Words indistinct] confirmation of Leonid Kravchuk that your  country will participate in this conference and work there  constructively.

			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / Drug groups fear falls from the top: Prices and patents squeezing best-sellers Four of the world's top selling drugs will probably see their sales growth slow or go into reverse over the next 18 months. Glaxo's ulcer treatment Zantac, the biggest of them all, until last month looked the least vulnerable. Now it seems that it could fall the hardest. The other three - all heart drugs from the US companies Merck, Bristol Myers Squibb and Pfizer - are also likely to topple from their peaks. Each faces the same problem and one that is relatively new to the prescription drug industry: price competition. The scale of the danger to the manufacturers is immense. The four drugs have annual sales of more than Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6.7bn), equivalent to twice the entire annual drugs budget of the UK's National Health Service. The makers owe their positions as industry leaders largely to these top-selling products. Only Merck has any other drugs with annual sales above Dollars 1bn and it also faces increasing competition. The pricing pressure emanates from changes in the healthcare market, especially in the US where drug buyers are playing competitors off against each other to drive prices lower. 'It is a paradigm change,' says Mr Jan Leschly, incoming chief executive of Anglo-US drugs company SmithKline Beecham. 'The organisations which pay for the drugs - insurers and employers - are making market forces work. It's happening without the need for the Clinton healthcare reforms.' Thanks to its patents, Zantac has been regarded as among the least likely to suffer a sharp reverse. That changed on March 22 when Ciba, of Switzerland, said it could bypass the patent protection and bring a rival to the market within 18 months. Ciba's attack relies on that fact that Zantac's active ingredient, ranitidine, comes in two different physical forms that are chemically identical. Zantac contains the newer form which has patent protection until the next century. Ciba says it will make the older form whose patents expire next year in Germany and in 1996 in the US. 'Zantac cannot escape generic competition from 1996,' says Mr Peter Laing, analyst at stockbroker Salomon Brothers. 'We expect profits to fall in both 1996 and 1997.' The patent crunch for Merck and Bristol Myers Squibb will come at about the same time. Merck's Vasotec and Bristol Myers Squibb's Capoten belong to a class of drugs called Ace-inhibitors. But different Ace-inhibitors have virtually identical effectiveness, implying that when the patent expires on one, sales of the others will be dragged down as unbranded generics flood the market. 'Most of the Ace-inhibitors on the market are at their peak sales,' says Mr Viren Mehta of New York specialist healthcare stocks researchers Mehta and Isaly. 'Price competition will be precipitated by the expiry of Capoten's patents in 1995.' The effect of patent expiries is already being felt at Pfizer, where sales of all versions of Procardia are down over the past six months, compared with rises of more than 10 per cent a year earlier. All four companies need look no further than the list of ex-blockbuster drugs to see frightening examples of the rapid fall in sales that can follow patent expiry. The anti-inflammatory drug Naprosyn, made by US company Syntex, once had annual sales of Dollars 1bn, but the number of US prescriptions dispensed halved because of patent expiry, according to Salomon Brothers. Of the four, Pfizer seems to have the strongest defences. Procardia sales are falling much more slowly than Naprosyn's because the company developed a slow-release version with a patented means of manufacture. Although patents on the active ingredient have expired, anyone wanting to make a slow release version would have to invent their own process for doing so. In addition, Pfizer has a newer heart drug on the market. Called Norvasc, it works by a similar mechanism to Procardia but with a better medical performance. Its sales more than doubled to Dollars 154m in the first quarter of this year, compared with 1993. Merck, too, has acted. The vulnerability of Vasotec was one of the factors behind its Dollars 6bn acquisition last year of drug distributor Medco, says Ms Jo Walton of London stockbroker Lehman Brothers. 'Other things being equal, Medco will sell Vasotec rather than its competitors.' Glaxo could try to do what Pfizer has done. It is already planning to submit for approval a patented, improved version of Zantac that also attacks the bacteria that are associated with ulcers. And it might be able to secure approval for Zantac to be sold without prescription over the counter (OTC) for acid stomach disorders. However, other companies have got there first. In the past few weeks, Sweden's Astra has secured approval for an anti-bacterial version of its fast growing ulcer drug Losec, and SmithKline Beecham has launched an OTC version of Tagamet, Zantac's predecessor as world's number one drug. To tackle the changing US market, Glaxo also plans to collaborate with other healthcare companies, although this is unlikely to be on the same scale as the Merck-Medco deal. A partner further down the distribution chain could promote Zantac, rather than a rival. One possible model is this month's agreement between the distributor Caremark and Bristol Myers Squibb with two other drugs companies. Unlike the Merck-Medco deal, no equity purchase was made. But it takes time for such alliances to be created and implemented, and the industry acknowledges that the downward pressure on drugs prices, and therefore on sales value and profits, is likely to increase. First Glaxo and then Capoten, Vasotec and Procardia would gradually lose their pre-eminence. Their places will be taken by new products, some rapidly growing companies such as Sweden's Astra and the most successful of the US biotechnology companies, Amgen. Their drugs may reach the top of the pile before the end of the decade. But by then the drug buyers' emphasis on price and competition could be shaping every part of the industry. The world may never again see four drugs with combined annual sales of Dollars 10bn.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                     THE TOP TEN BLOCKBUSTERS  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                              1993 sales Brand name             Treatment          Marketed By        (Dollars m)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Zantac                 anti-ulcer, H2     Glaxo                  3520                        antag  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Procardia/XL/Adalat    cardiovascular     Pfizer, Bayer          2100  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Vasotec                cardiovascular     Merck                  2065  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Epogen/Eprex           hemotology         Amgen, Johnson &amp;       1805                                           Johnson, Kirin,                                           Chugai, Sankyo  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Capoten                cardiovascular     Bristol Myers Squibb   1800                                           Sankyo  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Pravachol/Lipostat     cholesterol        Bristol Myers Squibb   1651                                           Sankyo  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Humulin/Novolin        diabetes           Eli Lilly, Shionogi,   1610                                           Yamanouchi, Hoechst,                                           Novo  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Losec/Prilosec         anti-ulcer         Astra, Merck           1526  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Cardizem/CD/SR         cardiovascular     Marion Merrell Dow,    1483                                           Tanabe, Syntehlabo,                                           Warner Lambert  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Intron/Roferon/        cancer             Roche, Wellcome,       1466                                           Sumitomo, Takeda,                                           Yamanouchi, SGP  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Lehman Brothers  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

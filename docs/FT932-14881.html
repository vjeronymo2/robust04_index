			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / Technology (Worth Watching): A testing mix for the drinks industry Many people have ordered an expensive brand of whisky or brandy in a bar only to suspect that the bottle has been topped up with a lesser - and cheaper - brand. What is bad news for the customer can be catastrophic news for the drinks maker, as such tactics reduce its credibility. To help traders ensure only their products are sold under their name, Biocode of Nottingham has developed a marking system which can be added to the liquor in just three or four parts per billion. Antibodies to these markers are then developed which react with it - by changing colour. By removing a trace of the liquor and mixing it with the antibodies it is possible to tell if the drink has been tampered with. Biocode: UK, 0904 430616.</p>

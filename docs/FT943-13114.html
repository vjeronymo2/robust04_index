			<p>940721 FT  21 JUL 94 / Spain returns trawler to France The Spanish government yesterday evening defused a political row with France by handing over La Gabrielle, the hijacked tuna trawler, to the French authorities. La Gabrielle had been held since last weekend by Spanish fishermen after violent clashes with their French counterparts over the size of the French trawler's tuna nets. France has since the start of the week been pressing for the return of La Gabrielle. Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, stepped up the diplomatic pressure by calling at yesterday's cabinet meeting for the 'immediate return' of the vessel and stressing that his government would press for 'compensation' for its owners. However a Spanish official, who boarded La Gabrielle on Tuesday, reported that its tuna nets were twice the maximum size of 2.5km permitted under European Union regulations. The Spanish authorities yesterday afternoon persuaded the hijackers to surrender La Gabrielle to them, but stressed that Spain would continue to lobby for the application of EU fishing regulations even after returning the trawler to French hands.</p>

			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / Prison officers can 'stop admittances' Prison officers have some legal powers which may have the effect of disrupting admissions to prisons, an emergency conference of their union was told yesterday. Lawyers told delegates it was within officers' powers to refuse to allow new inmates into overcrowded jails on the grounds that there was a risk of a disturbance. The High Court has ruled that the Prison Officers Association cannot call on members to refuse admissions as part of their campaign against privatisation of prisons. It ruled that prison officers had the legal status of constables. The POA executive yesterday argued that this legal status meant that officers had a duty to prevent breaches of the peace. Mr John Bartell, the POA chairman, said: 'Where officers believe there are likely to be disturbances or disruption, they will be within their rights not to let new inmates in. I have every reason to believe that will happen.' The POA's tough response could signal a fresh period of prison service unrest, first triggered by the High Court injunction which blocked the use of locking out prisoners as a form of industrial action. But the Home Office last night argued that the court ruling did not imply any changes in the duties of prison officers, and it said officers had the powers and privileges of a constable only when carrying out their duties as laid down in prison rules. 'Preventing a breach of the peace is not something that comes within their duties,' it said. The Home Office insisted that it had no desire to take away prison officers' employment protection rights when it sought the court injunction. Mr Derek Lewis, director general of the Prison Service, said he hoped to resume talks with the POA to place industrial relations on a 'proper footing'. He said the court ruling meant that a change in the law would probably be needed for employment protection rights to be restored. Some trade unions fear the government may try to legislate to prevent strikes in essential services. Mr Lewis said: 'We have made it crystal clear that we want the Prison Officers Association and the Prison Governors Association and other unions to continue to play an active part in the prison service.' The status of the POA has also been called into question because most of its members are classed as constables, and industrial relations law says a trade dispute can only involve people classed as 'workers'. The Prison Governors' Association is similarly affected. The certification office of the Trade Union and Employers Associations is reviewing the union's status. Mr Graham Osborne, assistant certification officer, said: 'The judge has said they are not workers and if they are not workers, they are not a trade union and if they are not a trade union they cannot be on the list of trade unions.'</p>

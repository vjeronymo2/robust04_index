			<p><P> December 6, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ONLY IN L.A.: PEOPLE AND EVENTS  </P> <P> Call it Miracle on 1st Street.  </P> <P> Those often unappreciated bureaucrats in City Hall will have their own  Christmas tree and menorah, after all.  </P> <P> And St. Nick didn't even have to lend a hand.  </P> <P> Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores' motion for the rotunda display was approved  Tuesday after reassurances that the tree and menorah -- as long as the latter  is unlit -- are considered secular symbols and thus appropriate for a  government building.  </P> <P> Only Monday, the Department of General Services told The Times that there would  be no such display for another reason: Council policy holds that decorations in  the rotunda must relate to municipal functions.  </P> <P> But a Flores aide brushed that policy aside as "open to interpretation."  </P> <P> When the subject came up last year, the council voted to place a "decorated"  tree -- which bore an uncanny resemblance to a Christmas tree -- and an unlit  menorah in the crowded Main Street lobby of City Hall.  </P> <P> The members briefly considered placing the display on the south lawn. But  Councilman Nate Holden warned there could be a problem.  </P> <P> "We have some people who are not all together," he pointed out. "They can  unscrew some of those bulbs."  </P> <P> "We can post armed guards," Council President John Ferraro quipped.  </P> <P> These days, council sessions are broadcast on cable television, so there was no  such colorful banter in the chamber Tuesday. In fact, Flores' motion passed  without a single word of debate.  </P> <P> When bad ratings and good intentions clash in the world of television, you know  the result.  </P> <P> "Homeroom," an ABC comedy, was canceled Tuesday after finishing 80th in the  latest Nielsen ratings.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, Councilman Mike Woos' office will present a commendation today to  the stars of the show, which Woo has praised for presenting positive images of  the inner city and of its residents.  </P> <P> Next to roadways, one of the most lively arenas of automotive battle is the  parking lot, where darting cars vie for treasured openings between the white  lines.  </P> <P> The other night in Newhall, however, no one challenged the long vehicle that  pulled into a supermarket lot -- possibly because it was a hearse with a  license plate that proclaimed, LAST RID, and script on the side that said,  "Death Cruiser."  </P> <P> Some people just love their work.  </P> <P> It's not exactly a case of having your cake and eating it too.  </P> <P> The 4-by-6-foot chocolate replica of the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, constructed  by five Bonaventure Hotel chefs to salute the Music Center's 25th anniversary,  will be admired -- but not eaten -- during today's ceremonies. (Guests will  dine instead on carrot cake.)  </P> <P> The chocolate edifice will merely sit on display in the Music Center Plaza. A  real test for chocoholics, considering that it contains 250 pounds of the dark  and white varieties.  </P> <P> Then what will happen to the cake?  </P> <P> A Bonaventure spokeswoman said it might be given to a homeless shelter.  </P> <P> But donations evidently aren't such simple matters anymore.  </P> <P> She said that the hotel would want to obtain a liability waiver for what would  be day-old fare.  </P></p>

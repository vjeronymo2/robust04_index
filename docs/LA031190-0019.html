			<p><P> March 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HUMAN BESTIARY  </P> <P> I enjoyed your article "Wild Things." However, I was disappointed by the  exclusion of squirrels.  </P> <P> As a resident of Los Feliz, I receive occasional visits from skunks, opossums,  raccoons and coyotes, but my favorite is my squirrel friend who scratches on my  window to remind me to leave a supply of nuts every morning.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, she is spied upon by a blue jay who follows her and steals most  of the nuts she buries.  </P> <P> GARY A.

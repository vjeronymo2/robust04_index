			<p><P> June 9, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CRISTIANI'S CLOSEST ADVISER DIES IN EL SALVADOR AMBUSH  </P> <P> An El Salvador Cabinet minister who was the new president's closest adviser was  killed today by unidentified men who riddled his car with machine-gun fire, the  governing political party said.  </P> <P> Jose Antonio Rodriguez, 70, the minister of the presidency, died shortly after  arriving at the Zaldivar Hospital, a nurse at the hospital said.  </P> <P> Rodriguez, the chief of staff, was a member of the rightist Republican  Nationalist Alliance of President Alfredo Cristiani, who took office June 1.  </P> <P> Rodriguez's driver and bodyguard also died in the attack, which occurred  shortly after the minister left his home in western San Salvador, according to  Armando Calderon Sol, president of the governing party, and other sources.  </P> <P> No group claimed responsibility for the attack, and no further details were  immediately available. Rodriguez took office June 1, the day Cristiani was  inaugurated for a five-year term.  </P> <P> Leftist guerrillas of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, who tried  to disrupt the election that brought Cristiani to power, vowed before the  inauguration to make El Salvador "ungovernable."  </P> <P> On Saturday, the guerrillas spurned Cristiani's proposal for dialogue aimed at  ending the nation's civil war. An estimated 70,000 people, most of them  civilians, have been killed since the civil war began nine years ago.  </P> <P> On Wednesday, guerrillas attacked nine military posts and claimed to have  killed or wounded six police in a raid on a coffee processing plant at San  Miguel de Mercedes, 50 miles north of the capital in Chalatenango province.  </P></p>

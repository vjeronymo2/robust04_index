			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Prudential in Pounds 106m Canadian sale Prudential Corporation, the UK's largest life insurer, is to complete its departure from the Canadian insurance market by selling its life and savings businesses to the Mutual Life Assurance Company of Canada for about CDollars 230m (Pounds 106m) in cash. The move follows disposals of other elements of its Canadian operations and of its Irish subsidiary. Mr Mick Newmarch, Prudential chief executive, has made it clear that the group intends to concentrate on its preferred markets of the UK, North America and the Far East. Prudential said yesterday that before the sale, it was buying back from its Canadian businesses mortgages and bonds worth CDollars 310m (Pounds 144m) and other assets worth about CDollars 120m (Pounds 56m), which Mutual Life did not want to acquire. These will be sold over the coming months. The transaction, which is unlikely to be completed before the beginning of March and is subject to regulators' approval, is expected to produce a small profit of between Pounds 10m and Pounds 20m for Prudential. With CDollars 16.6bn assets at the end of last year, Mutual Life is one of the largest Canadian life companies, while the net assets of the businesses Prudential is selling amounted only to CDollars 59m at the same time. In a generally flat Canadian life insurance market, Prudential's gross premium income last year was CDollars 302m (Pounds 154m). Prudential believes that it will be better placed to expand in Canada through Jackson National Life, its US subsidiary, rather than by maintaining a very small presence through other operations. The Canadian businesses contributed just Pounds 5m to Prudential's half-year pre-tax profits of Pounds 280m.</p>

			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / Backbench Euro-sceptics stoke Tory election fears The difficulties facing Conservative party leaders in producing a unifying manifesto for the Euro-elections in June were further underlined by renewed demands from backbench Euro-sceptics in the Commons yesterday. In a debate on moves towards the enlargement of the European Union through the inclusion of newly democratic states in central and eastern Europe, they reiterated calls for the renegotiation of the Maastricht treaty. Mr John Biffen, Conservative MP for Shropshire North and a former Cabinet minister, maintained that enlargement of the EU must involve re-examination of commitments to a single European currency, a central bank and economic convergence of the member states. Such questions, he said, were not merely being raised by the 'awkward squad' on the Tory back benches. Mr Biffen pressed for a clear statement from all the leaders of the European Union on the prospects for enlargement in the context of re-negotiating existing commitments. Mr Bill Cash, Conservative MP for Stafford and the most persistent critic of the Maastricht treaty, said it was 'perfectly apparent' that it was not working. He also suggested that the Treaty of Rome, on which the original European Community was founded, needed to be renegotiated as well. Mr Bernard Jenkin, Conservative MP for Colchester North, warned that orders providing for association agreements with Bulgaria, the Czech and Slovak republics and with Romania could lead to the period for phasing out tariffs on 'sensitive' products continuing for as long as 10 years.</p>

			<p><P> March 24, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UMPIRES TO PROTEST, SKIP SPRING TRAINING  </P> <P> Major league umpires, angry because they were not consulted about the revised  regular-season schedule, said Friday they would protest by not working spring  training games.  </P> <P> Richie Phillips, head of the umpires' union, called it "a very, very symbolic  protest." He said its intent was to prod owners to resolve differences over  compensation for canceled exhibition games and other matters arising from the  32-day lockout.  </P> <P> Phillips said the protest would not affect the regular season and that umpires  would be ready to work on opening day April 9.  </P> <P> "Our primary fight is over the lack of respect on the part of the owners and  the callous attitude they have toward the umpires," Phillips said.  </P> <P> Lou Gorman, Boston Red Sox general manager, called the umpires' move "hard to  believe. It's ridiculous."  </P> <P> Phillips said that he had filed a charge of unfair labor practice with the  National Labor Relations Board, saying the owners hadn't bargained in good  faith and changed working conditions without consulting the umpires.  </P> <P> "They are willing to suffer (a) loss of pay for the spring training games in  order to level this protest with the owners," he said.  </P> <P> The union encouraged minor league umpires to work the spring training games,  which start Monday. Phillips said there would be no picketing at the game  sites.  </P> <P> "We don't consider this a strike," Phillips said. "It's not a boycott. It's a  refusal on the part of the umpires to be recalled."  </P> <P> Phyllis Merhige, a spokeswoman for the American League, and Katy Feeney, a  spokeswoman for the National League, both said "professional" umpires would be  on hand for Monday's games.  </P> <P> Ed Lawrence, head of minor league umpire development, said his staff was  "preparing to fill the void."  </P> <P> "Any umpire who is not under major league contract can work," Lawrence said.  </P> <P> Phillips said he last talked with representatives of the owners Thursday  afternoon and told Commissioner Fay Vincent of his pending action Thursday  night.  </P> <P> "If they sat down and bargained in good faith we could probably settle in a  half hour," he said.  </P> <P> Baseball announced Thursday that it will play a full 162-game schedule,  extending the season for three days and making up during the year other games  lost because of the lockout.  </P> <P> Phillips said this probably meant fewer off days for umpires, who already have  "onerous" work and travel schedules. He said umpires should be compensated for  the living expenses they incurred while standing by during the lockout.  </P></p>

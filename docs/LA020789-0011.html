			<p><P> February 7, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THIS TIME, LAS VEGAS ROUTS UC SANTA BARBARA, 77-61  </P> <P> UC Santa Barbara, which upset Nevada Las Vegas twice last season, was no match  for the Rebels Monday night in the Thomas and Mack Center at Las Vegas.  </P> <P> David Butler scored 21 points and Greg Anthony added 19 to lead 19th-ranked Las  Vegas to a 77-61 Big West Conference basketball victory.  </P> <P> The Rebels led only 7-6 after 5 minutes, but then outscored Santa Barbara,  13-0, over the next 4 minutes to gain a 20-6 lead.  </P> <P> They gained a 37-24 halftime lead behind Anthony's 14 points. Santa Barbara,  led by Mike Doyle's 17 points and Carrick DeHart's 13, could pull no closer in  the second half than the final margin.  </P> <P> Las Vegas is 15-5 overall, 10-1 in Big West play.  </P> <P> Santa Barbara (15-4, 6-4) fell 3 1/2 games behind the Rebels and a half game  behind second-place New Mexico State (7-4).  </P> <P> Las Vegas opened the second half with strong shooting and quickly took control.  </P> <P> The Rebels held a 49-29 lead with 15:30 left as Las Vegas shot 63% and Santa  Barbara shot a dismal 33%.  </P> <P> Both teams settled down, but Las Vegas held its 20-point margin with Stacey  Augmon and George Ackles controlling the tempo. Ackles' inside defense  frustrated Santa Barbara's penetrating offense. He had four blocked shots  midway through the second half.  </P> <P> So, the Gauchos tried to go outside, but Las Vegas' tough defense denied them  good shots.  </P> <P> The Rebels built their biggest lead, 71-47, on Butler's dunk late in the game.  But Doyle made three quick baskets and Gary Gray added a jumper to pull the  Gauchos within 71-55.  </P></p>

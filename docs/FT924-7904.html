			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / International Company News: Saab injection could total SKr3bn SWEDEN'S Saab Automobile is to receive a capital injection of between SKr2bn and SKr3bn (Dollars 335m-Dollars 503m) in the next few months, according to Saab-Scania, which jointly owns the company with General Motors of the US. Mr Lars Kylberg, president of Saab-Scania, said the final amount would be decided in December once Saab Automobile has finalised its new business plan. The motor group announced a wide-ranging rationalisation plan on Monday, including 2,000 job cuts, in order to save SKr2bn. In June 1991 the joint owners ploughed SKr5.5bn in Saab, which has made losses for the last three years, and doubts have been expressed about the extent to which they would continue to provide support. 'This will be last time,' said Mr Kylberg yesterday. The hope is that the capital injection, together with the cost-cutting measures and the launch of the group's new model next year, will provide the basis for Saab's return to profitability. The group made a SKr1.3bn loss in the first nine months of 1992 and says it expects to make a loss of more than SKr2bn in the full year. Volvo will delay but not cancel plans to invest some SKr500m in a Polish joint venture, Reuter reports from Stockholm. A spokesman said negotiations to build a new plant in Poland are continuing. Volvo had hoped for a final agreement by the end of this year, but this will not now happen. The spokesman did not give any new timetable.</p>

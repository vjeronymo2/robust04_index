			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / Irish parties urge 'Yes' vote on Maastricht Treaty THE LEADERS of Ireland's four main political parties made a joint call yesterday for a 'yes' vote in the referendum on the Maastricht Treaty which is to be held on June 18. In a rare display of cross-party unity, the leaders of Fianna Fail, Fine Gael, Labour and the Progressive Democrats, which between them represent 153 of the 166 seats in the Irish parliament (Dail), said that following Denmark's rejection of the Treaty, 'it is, more than ever, vitally important for Ireland, and for Europe, that the people of Ireland vote 'Yes' . . . a 'No' vote would be clearly against our national interest'. Of particular importance for Ireland is the proposed doubling of EC structural and cohesion funds for the four 'Objective 1' countries, made under the Delors II proposals, and under which Ireland would hope to obtain IPounds 6bn (Pounds 5.5bn) for the 1994-98 period, as opposed to IPounds 3bn for 1989-93. Both the UK and Germany have expressed strong reservations over the Delors II package, as they would be the main contributors. Mr Bertie Ahern, the finance minister, was yesterday expected to emphasise to his fellow-EC finance ministers the importance of the funds for Ireland and for Irish voters' perceptions of the Maastricht Treaty. He is hoping to be able to bring back to Dublin some reassurances that the money will indeed be available. Mr Albert Reynolds, the prime minister, warned yesterday, however, that Ireland 'would not even have a place at the negotiating table' to argue for its share of the structural funds if the country votes 'No'.</p>

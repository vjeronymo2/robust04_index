			<p><P> April 17, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> REGIONAL ROUNDUP: EVEREST &amp; JENNINGS EXPECTS $41-MILLION LOSS FOR '89  </P> <P> Everest &amp; Jennings International Ltd. said it expects to report a  $41-million loss for 1989 and that it needs a $55-million line of credit and a  $15-million cash infusion to keep operating.  </P> <P> The Camarillo-based company, which is one of the nation's biggest wheelchair  producers, previously had indicated that it would post a major loss for the  year because of restructuring costs, inventory writedowns and start-up costs  for new products.  </P> <P> Everest &amp; Jennings said its controlling stockholder, Industrial Equity  (Pacific) Ltd., recently made an $8.1-million investment in the company in  addition to its original stock purchases, and that it is willing to provide yet  another $15 million in cash that the company needs.  </P> <P> That second investment is subject to several conditions, including the  company's ability to get the $55 million in credit from its banks, the company  said. Industrial Equity is controlled by New Zealand financier Ronald Brierley.  </P> <P> Everest &amp; Jennings, at Industrial Equity's request, also proposed to  consolidate its Class A and Class B common shares into a single class, subject  to shareholders' approval. Each Class B share has 10 times the voting power of  the Class A stock, and Industrial Equity currently owns about 51% of the Class  B shares.  </P></p>

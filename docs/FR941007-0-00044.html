			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. The USEPA is approving the requested SIP revision submitted on March 7, 1994. The submittal consists of Title 326 IAC 2&hyph;1&hyph;1, 2&hyph;1&hyph;2, 2&hyph;1&hyph;3, 2&hyph;3&hyph;1, 2&hyph;3&hyph;2, 2&hyph;3&hyph;3, and 2&hyph;3&hyph;5. The State of Indiana has submitted a complete plan to implement the new source review provisions of part D. Each of the program elements mentioned above was properly addressed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The USEPA is also approving the recodified permitting rules to replace those in the existing SIP which were approved as APC 19 at 40 CFR 52.770(c)(24). The incorporation of the recodified version of these Indiana rules into the SIP will make it easier for the public, the State and USEPA to identify precisely what permitting provisions are part of the SIP. Some confusion surrounding what State rules were part of the permitting SIP has existed since Indiana recodified its APC rules into the Title 325 of the Indiana Administrative Code (IAC) and subsequently into Title 326 IAC. After the effective date of this final rule all of Indiana's permitting SIP rules will be contained in Title 326 of the IAC.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Consistent with section 110(n)(3) of the amended Act the USEPA is taking this opportunity to remove references in 52.773(i) and 52.777(d) to the sanctions formerly imposed on Lake and Porter Counties which were lifted by the 1990 Act amendments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because USEPA considers these actions to be noncontroversial and routine, we are approving them without prior proposal. This action will become effective on December 6, 1994. However, if we receive adverse comments on these actions by November 7, 1994, then USEPA will publish a final rule that withdraws the action, and will address the comments received in the final rule on the requested SIP revision which has been proposed for approval in the proposed rules section of this  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . The public comment period will not be extended or reopened.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Executive Order (EO) 12866  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This action has been classified as a Table 2 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993, memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has exempted this regulatory action from Executive Order 12866 review.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to the SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> V. Regulatory Flexibility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , USEPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities. 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, USEPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the Act do not create any new requirements, but simply approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP-approval does not impose any new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-state relationship under the Act, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The Act forbids USEPA to base its actions concerning SIP's on such grounds.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Union Electric Co.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> U.S. E.P.A. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 427 U.S. 246, 256&hyph;66 (S.Ct 1976); 42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by December 6, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review nor does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements.

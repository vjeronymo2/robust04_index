			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The key findings presented to and adopted by the Regulations Task Force were the following: (1) Federal agencies and SHPOs should be given greater authority to conclude Section 106 review; (2) the Council should spend more time monitoring program trends and overall performance of Federal agencies and SHPOs and less time reviewing individual cases or participating in case-specific consultation; (3) Section 106 review requirements should be integrated with environmental review required by other statutes; (4) enforcement of Section 106 should be increased and specific remedies should be provided for failure to comply; and (5) there should be expanded opportunities for public involvement in the Section 106 process. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Summary of Regulatory Changes <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Consistent with the findings adopted by the Council Regulations Task Force, the Council proposes to revise its regulations as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Subpart A_Background and Policy <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This Subpart adds a new section describing the goals of the consultation process (Section 800.1(b)) and clarifying the roles of participants in the Section 106 process, particularly those of Native Americans and Native Hawaiians (Section 800.1(e)) as required by the 1992 NHPA amendments. The provision regarding Native American and Native Hawaiian participation provides detailed guidance on how Federal agency officials consult with Native American and Native Hawaiian organizations that attach religious and cultural significance to historic properties that may be affected by an undertaking (Section 800.1(e)(5)). The section on participants in the Section 106 process also elaborates on the role and rights of the public to participate in the process (Section 800.6(e)(6)). In order to encourage consideration of historic properties as early in the planning stages as possible, the regulations specifically set forth a section on timing (Section 800.6(c)). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Subpart A also adds new definitions and revises current definitions to conform to the 1992 NHPA amendments and to clarify terms which have raised questions during the implementation of the Section 106 process (Section 800.2). New definitions include: agency, anticipatory demolition, approval of the expenditure of funds, comment, conditional no adverse effect agreement, consultation, Council membership, foreclosure, head of the agency, memorandum of agreement, Native Hawaiian, Native Hawaiian organization, notice of violation, traditional community, and traditional cultural authority. Revised definitions include: agency official, area of potential effects, historic property, Indian tribe, interested (party) person, Indian (tribal) lands, and undertaking. The definition of undertaking has been changed to accord with the intent of the statutory definition provided in the 1992 NHPA amendments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Subpart B_Federal Procedures to Implement Section 106 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

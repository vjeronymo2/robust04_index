			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / Markets Report: Germany lowers rates The Bundesbank surprised the market yesterday by lowering both the discount and Lombard rates by 50 basis points, but the move failed to help the weak dollar, writes Philip Gawith. The discount rate was cut to 4.5 per cent and the Lombard rate to 6 per cent. This sparked a host of cuts in other European countries, with Italy, Belgium, Denmark, Austria and the Netherlands reducing rates. France cut rates before the German announcement. The rate reduction was well received in the short sterling and Euromark futures markets. But the failure of the dollar to respond was taken by analysts as a signal that the US currency would not recover without a decisive tightening of policy from the Federal Reserve. The dollar declined to a DM1.6682 close in New York. The fall in European rates coincided with a decline in Japan's core overnight rate, which fell to an historic low of 2 1/16 per cent amid speculation that the Bank of Japan was trying to weaken the yen. The Bundesbank's decision to lower rates caught the market offside. While many thought there was at least an even chance of a cut, almost none were predicting more than a 25 basis-point cut in official rates. This, said analysts, added weight to the view that the German rate cut was part of concerted central bank support for the dollar. Although the Bundesbank said the move reflected improved inflation prospects, Mr Robin Aspinall, analyst at Panmure Gordon, said a 50 basis-point cut could not be explained in domestic terms alone. This suggested that the Bundesbank was 'playing to a wider audience'. In so far as the German central bank was trying to help the dollar, it failed. The US currency slipped steadily lower against the D-Mark. Mr Avinash Persaud, head of currency research at JP Morgan, said the message to the mar-ket was that 'the Fed is the gatekeeper to the dollar'. A 'step and stop' Fed, with rates being moved decisively higher and then kept there, was needed to support the dollar. Mr Persaud said that with the Fed likely to raise rates by 50 basis points, the prospect of a 100 basis-point swing in favour of the dollar meant 'it would be a brave investor who bet against the dollar'. But Mr Chris Turner, currency strategist at BZW, noted that the last two occasions when the Fed and Bundesbank moved rates in close unison, back in 1991 when US rates were falling and German rates rising, this had the perverse effect of boosting the dollar. In the second case, said Mr Turner, the result was to push the dollar from DM1.45 to above DM1.80 in the space of only five months. Mr Turner said the message was that markets punished a currency when the central bank was perceived to be 'behind the game' on inflation. Depending on the size of the Fed's next move, this could yet be the fate which awaits the dollar. The Bundesbank's move contributed to a very active day on the futures markets. The June, September and December short sterling contracts each traded more than 25,000 lots, while the equivalent Euromark contracts traded 50,000 to 70,000 lots. The June short sterling contract closed at 94.69, nine basis points up from Tuesday, while the December contract finished 12 basis points higher at 93.84. Mr Peter Osler, economist at brokers GNI, said there was a general feeling in the market that 'we are not going to have higher UK rates this year, bolstered by the aggressive German easing'. He said short sterling was continuing a 'sensible correction', prompted by a discussion in the Bank of England's quarterly report which explained that recent short sterling weakness was essentially a technical phenomenon, flowing from building societies hedging their exposure to fixed rate mortgages. In the UK money markets, the Bank of England dispatched with ease a Pounds 450m shortage. The overnight rate moved in the 3 7/8 to 4 3/4 per cent range. The Euromark futures also finished firmer, the June contract gaining 7 basis points at 95.09 and the December contract up at 95.24 from 95.19. Helped by the weak dollar, the D-Mark finished in Europe generally firmer. Against the French franc it closed in London at FFr3.430 from FFr3.424 after the Bank of France trimmed its intervention rate to 5.50 per cent from 5.60 per cent. It was the seventh such cut since February 24. Although the timing surprised analysts, they said the BOF was continuing to track the German repo. The Spanish peseta slipped to finish at Pta82.54 against the D-Mark from Pta82.14, after newspaper reports of another scandal potentially damaging to the government. Sterling traded in a fairly narrow range, closing virtually unchanged at DM2.4911 from DM2.4907. It was buffeted back and forth by the combination of a supportive Bank of England report, soft UK manufacturing output data, and the larger than expected German rate cut.</p>

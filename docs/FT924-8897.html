			<p>921109 FT  09 NOV 92 / CBI revives its script for recovery / A look at industry's call for action on a well-rehearsed programme A NEW partnership between industry, government and the City to rebuild Britain's manufacturing base and to eliminate the country's trade deficit is called for today by the Confederation of British Industry. Its blueprint to revive what it describes as the UK's 'economic backbone' covers a great deal of well-rehearsed territory, with its thinly veiled criticisms of the banks and the Department of Trade and Industry, and calls for a new consensus and fresh priorities. The employer's organisation has been calling for a tripartite programme of co-operation to rebuild the manufacturing sector since the downturn began. Now it believes its message has been given added urgency by the record-breaking recession. In its report, Making It In Britain, the CBI's national manufacturing council acknowledges that some progress was achieved during the 1980s in a sector that employs 10m people, accounts for 70 per cent of exports and contributes Pounds 100bn to the nation's gross domestic product. But in spite of improvements in output, productivity, export share and investment, the document repeats the sad saga of Britain's continuing failure to climb the league of international competitiveness. One of the authors says: 'We have some of the best manufacturing companies but we still have too many of the worst.' The report identifies the poor image of manufacturing as one of industry's main problems. It claims the sector still suffers from a Victorian image of smoke-stacks and metal-bashing. 'Until it can show that industry represents an exciting, rewarding and challenging career, it will struggle to attract the country's best young people.' The national manufacturing council sets a number of targets to be achieved by the year 2000. These include: an increase in national productivity of more than five per cent each year; investment in plant and machinery to double per employee from the present Pounds 2,000 a year; an increase of 1 per cent in the UK's proportion of world exports; and a drive to replace imports with UK-manufactured goods. The report accepts that, in spite of industry's criticisms of Whitehall and the City, the prime responsibility for improving manufacturing performance lies with companies. It calls on them to do more to establish a clear sense of strategic direction, to exploit new markets more rapidly, to place emphasis on innovation and to communicate strategy more effectively to the financial community. Inevitably, much of the case for new thinking is directed at Whitehall and the City. Apart from the now ritualistic calls for a more listening government, the CBI wants conditions for sustainable growth - low inflation and low interest rates. Its request for accompanying stable exchange rates looks fanciful after British withdrawal from the ERM, a discipline which the CBI supported but over which it now appears ambivalent. The CBI also calls for enhanced tax allowances to boost the introduction of new technology and energy-saving and pollution-control equipment. It wants the government to continue to cut the overall tax burden on business - still seen as high by international standards, in spite of lower corporate tax rates. The report revives some familiar criticisms of the City. It points out that banks increased property lending by 800 per cent in the 1980s while advances to manufacturing clients rose by only 50 per cent. Institutional pressure to cough up on dividends meant that dividend growth averaged 12 per cent annually in the 1980s, while profits rose by six per cent and investment by only 2 per cent a year. The banks, concludes the report, should take 'a more strategic view on criteria for long-term lending'. The CBI wants to see more effective partnerships between investors and industry that would recognise the investment attractions of manufacturing, ease pressure for excessive dividends and develop more packages for small and medium-sized companies. The logic of the CBI's case seems sound, and the renewed weakness of the British economy suggests that its appraisal goes to the heart of many of British manufacturing's problems. Whether its latest effort can help trigger the type of critical sea-change in British attitudes towards manufacturing that so far has stubbornly failed to materialise is much more difficult to judge.

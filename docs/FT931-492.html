			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / InterCity bids for Pounds 150m to lease trains BRITISH RAIL'S InterCity business yesterday said it hoped to take advantage of the government's new rolling-stock leasing arrangements by bidding for Pounds 150m of funds to finance a fleet of replacement trains for the London Euston to Manchester line. It also said it expected to report a small profit in the financial year just ending and announced a marketing venture with Shell UK offering motorists free train tickets in exchange for petrol vouchers. The leasing deal would take advantage of the government's decision last autumn to make Pounds 150m available to BR in an attempt to establish a leasing market for rolling stock in the run-up to railway privatisation. If it succeeds, InterCity will order about 15 more of the InterCity 225 trains built by GEC Alsthom, the Anglo-French engineering company. It has already supplied trains for services running to and from London King's Cross. The 15 trains would replace those operating between London and Manchester, and the displaced trains would in turn replace the outdated trains running between London and the west Midlands. However, InterCity's bid is subject to competition from Network SouthEast, which wants to use the Pounds 150m to lease a fleet of 40 modified Networker trains built by ABB Transportation (formerly Brel). These would replace outdated rolling stock on Kent coast routes. Mr Roger Freeman, minister for public transport, is expected to announce a decision on the competing bids after Easter. The joint promotion with Shell is the most unusual element of a spring marketing campaign unveiled by Mr Chris Green, InterCity's managing director. Shell said it expected most tickets handed out to be for journeys that would not otherwise have been undertaken, or at least not by road. Other features of the InterCity marketing campaign, which is aimed at countering the effects of the recession, include: Afternoon tea and weekend restaurant car services will be restored on selected services in response to passenger demand. The InterCity shuttle will offer high-frequency services from London to the west Midlands, east Midlands and East Anglia. Tickets which are the cheapest in real terms since 1948 will be available through the extension of Apex fares to all InterCity journeys of more than 150 miles.</p>

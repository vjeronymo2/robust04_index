			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / People: Builder constructs new GrandMet financial path Gerald Corbett, Redland's 42-year-old finance director, right, has been headhunted to join Grand Metropolitan, a company with a market capitalisation more than three times that of Redland. The food and drinks group's share price fell 13p to 445p, while the building materials stock came off a more modest 6p to 577p. His appointment follows a surprise re-shuffle in September, as a consequence of which George Bull was promoted to chief executive of GrandMet and David Nash, the previous finance director, moved up to become head of all food operations. Corbett describes himself as a 'pre-active, open and communicative ' finance chief, who has steered Redland through 'the worst recession in the construction industry in the UK this century'. He points proudly to Redland's 'financial ratios which are some of the best in the sector, a gearing ratio of 30 per cent and interest cover of 8 times'. He has been in the post six years, and is only four years younger than Redland's chief executive, Robert Napier. By contrast he is eight years junior to the next youngest member of the GrandMet board. 'Yes, GrandMet is a lot bigger,' says Corbett, 'but that is what it is all about, isn't it?' Corbett came to Redland from Dixons, where he had been director of corporate finance. Before that he had worked as a management consultant with Boston Consulting Group. He has an MBA from London Business School. Though evidently surprised at the fall in the share price yesterday, he was not prepared to comment directly on the market's view of his appointment. He says Redland will look outside for his replacement; he will probably leave after the annual results in March, at which time his successor will 'hopefully' be in place.</p>

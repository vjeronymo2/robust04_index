			<p>920826 FT  26 AUG 92 / Chileans learn costs of popular capitalism: An unforeseen legal loophole IN THEORY, Mr Victor Canete should be a rich man. As a technician in Chilectra Metropolitana, Chile's biggest power distribution company, he was encouraged to buy shares when it was privatised in 1985. Like most of his colleagues Mr Canete joined a new legion of popular capitalists by dipping into his severance pay fund to take part in the government's share offer to Chilectra employees. But in 1987 Chilectra's general manager, Mr Jose Yuraszeck, and other executives devised a way of gaining control of the government's last remaining stake in the company. They persuaded employees to swap their shares for 'ownership rights' in two investment societies - known as 'Chispitas 1 and 2' - controlled by Chilectra executives. The shares were used as collateral against bank loans that allowed the executives to buy a controlling stake in the company. Chilectra and its holding company Enersis have grown through diversification and a series of astute acquisitions. Profits have grown exponentially and their shares are hot favourites on Santiago's buoyant stock exchange. Yet Chilectra's employees, who helped jump-start the privatisation programme in Chile when its success was less than certain, have seen only a fraction of this bonanza. Their share of Enersis' profits has gone to repay the Chispitas bank loans used to finance acquisitions. Mr Marcelo Brito, Enersis's financial director, says employees were warned their participation in Chispitas would be a long-term investment. He says employees have received 30 per cent of the dividends due - which last year amounted to about three months' pay. But some employees believed they were duped into exchanging a highly liquid asset - Chilectra shares - for theoretical ownership rights in investment societies they do not control. 'Our shares are trapped. We cannot appoint nor dismiss Chispita directors and we have no say in their investment decisions,' says Mr Canete, now president of one of the Chilectra unions. Employees can only sell their 'ownership quotas' to other employees of the Enersis holding. These are internally traded at a deep discount to their asset value. Mr Canete says most employees want their shareholding to be translated into a real say in the running of the company. Failing that they want the Chispitas wound up to enable them to cash in on the real value of their investments. Enersis' executives are members of an emerging group in Chile's small business community who control former state-owned companies without actually owning them. Chile's privatisation programme was halted after the return of democracy in 1990. Mr Alejandro Foxley, finance minister, says the sale of state companies 'lacked transparency'. But the new government has not probed alleged irregularities, despite the fact that many Chileans feel aggrieved by the way companies were sold under the military regime. At Soquimich, the world's biggest iodine producer, employees originally received shares in lieu of productivity bonuses. The workers formed an investment company, Pampa Calichera, which built up a 20 per cent stake in Soquimich. The investment company became the target of two rival takeover bids, one led by Mr Eduardo Bobenreith, a former general manager. He lost to the company's present executives, who used a company called Inversiones Oro Blanco. The workers were persuaded - some union leaders say forced - into exchanging their shares in their own investment company for cash and shares in management-controlled Oro Blanco. Both Mr Bobenreith and Oro Blanco were made to pay heavy fines by Chile's securities watchdog for breaching takeover regulations but by then the takeover had been accomplished. The privatisation of Iansa, a huge agri-industrial complex supplying 80 per cent of Chile's sugar, was launched with an employee share-ownership scheme and a share offer to sugar beet farmers. Together they formed an investment company, Campos Chilenos, that became embroiled in a bitter takeover battle. The struggle pitted Campos Chilenos against French sugar trader Sucres et Denrees (Sucden) and a subsidiary of Continental Bank of Chicago, which together held a majority stake in the sugar monopoly. Two years of law suits, injunctions and fierce boardroom battles paralysed the company. Iansa's profits plunged, as did its share price and that of Campos Chilenos. Sucden and Chicago Continental gave up the battle at the end of 1991. Campos Chilenos, unlike the Chispitas, is traded on the stock exchange so employees were free to buy and sell their shares. However, some employees still believe they were used as pawns in a corporate power game: fewer than half of the company's employees now retain shares and employees no longer control the company. The proliferation of closed investment societies as vehicles for corporate control exploits a loophole in Chilean company law. Closed societies are accountable only to their members and fall outside the jurisdiction of the Chilean securities commission. Nevertheless, the loophole has begun to worry the authorities, as well as business leaders who have resisted the temptation offered by this legal twilight zone. In the US, companies can obtain tax advantages if they promote employee share-ownership programmes (Esops). But according to Mr Guillermo Morales, a Chilean lawyer who worked with Esops in Chicago, these schemes come with important safeguards to prevent them becoming sitting ducks for predators. 'US companies acknowledge that share ownership changes the contractual relationship between the company and its employees,' says Mr Morales. 'Chilean labour law is ill-suited to deal with this new relationship.' Mr Morales also believes that Chilean employees lack the sophistication of their counterparts in the US. They are often unaware of their rights, fear victimisation, and lack good legal counsel. 'There is a huge gulf between the paternalism that still governs industrial relations in Chile and the move to create a modern capital market with a broad ownership base.' For Latin American and east European countries currently pushing through privatisation programmes, the Chilean experience points to the need for effective legislation to protect the rights of individual shareholders, lest executive control makes a travesty of the notion of popular capitalism.</p>

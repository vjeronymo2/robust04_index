			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Horrors of a dog's life in Vietnamese kitchens Sir, I am not in the habit of writing to papers but have been moved to do so by 'Letter from Hanoi' (December 3/4). I wonder if Victor Mallet made any inquiries as to how the dogs that he so much enjoyed eating were killed. In many parts of south-east Asia they are killed by slow strangulation or are beaten to death, as this is supposed to make the meat more tender. I am not a vegetarian, and have just enjoyed a meal of roast pork, but I am confident that the pig was killed quickly and painlessly and it certainly was not kept in a cage in my kitchen while another pig was being cooked. I suggest that Mallet makes a donation to the International Fund for Animal Welfare, which is working hard in south-east Asia to prevent the torture of dogs and cats before they are eaten.

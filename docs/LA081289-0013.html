			<p><P> August 12, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PART-TIME COLLEGE TEACHERS  </P> <P> Why didn't Gordon mention one of the main reasons that this unfair system has  been allowed to exist, at least in the Los Angeles Community Colleges? It is a  verifiable fact that department chairs get a considerable stipend for every  part-timer who teaches, presumably because of the paper work involved in  scheduling classes.  </P> <P> Therefore, when a large department has three times as many part-timers as  full-time teachers, the chair of that department is making (not earning) a nice  addition to the base salary.  </P> <P> As always, these inequitable matters seem to come down to a matter of  economics.  </P> <P> MARGIE REMAR  </P> <P> Van Nuys  </P></p>

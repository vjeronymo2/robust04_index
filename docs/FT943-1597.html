			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / Survey of Property in London's West End (6): UK institutions take the slack - Finance Today's West End investment market is very different from that of the early 1990s, leading West End agents agree. Foreign investors have ceased to be the driving force; pension funds are a declining influence; bank financing through mortgages has given way to cash purchases; but, paradoxically, some long term institutional funders are happy for developers to blow the dust off long-stalled schemes. Most important of all, UK institutions are back, keen not to miss the rental growth they now believe is coming. Foreign investment peaked in 1990. 'The light went on when the UK left the ERM,' says Stephen Hubbard of Richard Ellis. In that year foreigners were the market, accounting for 90 per cent of all activity. High yields, which moved in line with interest rates, created a bond-style market in property with which foreigners were familiar. UK institutions, by contrast, were dismayed at the absence of growth potential. Foreign buyers could not continue to dominate such a big market for long, of course. By 1992, their influence had dropped back to 80 per cent. Last year, as the market began to recover its nerve, the foreign figure was down to 64 per cent and in the first half of this year had fallen back to perhaps 40 per cent. Middle Eastern investors continue to remain interested; they have been a permanent feature of the market for many years, as have the Dutch pension funds. The Germans, however, appear to be digesting the West End properties they snapped up so enthusiastically at the start of the decade. As for the promised influx of US money, it remains a case of 'Will they, won't they?' Far Eastern investors are more reliable; Jones Lang Wootton expects them to account for as much as Pounds 200m of the Pounds 1bn likely to be spent in the West End this year. Far Eastern investors, for instance, are thought to have paid around Pounds 30m for Trevelyan House, though that was perhaps atypically large. The investment market as a whole went very quiet over the summer. 'Not a lot happened in August,' Mr Hubbard noted, while JLW was predicting little more than Pounds 100m of new deals would be sewn up in the third quarter. In early September fourth quarter prospects were beginning to look more active, especially for deals around or under Pounds 10m. But will the picture change again if investors perceive interest rates to be on the rise once more? Before the Chancellor raised interest rates in mid month, Richard Ellis's Mr Hubbard was confident that 'the ingredients are there for rental growth'. His counterpart at rival JLW, John Stephen, was even prepared to go public with a prediction that 'rents will go well over Pounds 50 per square foot during 1995'. (The current peak is thought to be the Pounds 42.50 paid by JP Morgan for the headlease on Almack House in St James's) But both agree that the recovery so far is only patchy and investors' confidence will only be sustained if that rental growth starts showing through. They have had enough of promises. Promise, however, is spurring on a number of developments. Prudential, for instance, is showing signs of activity over its four-acre Portcullis project in Knightsbridge which has lain fallow for some years; and Norwich Union has woken up in Golden Square in Soho. They and other developers are encouraged as much by the shortage of investment grade properties in an area dominated by small, listed buildings, as by hard evidence that rents have begun to rise. Yields have been hardening on office property but the trend has been sharper and hascome earlier on prime retail space. Agents Healey &amp; Baker report yields of between 4.5 and 5 per cent in Oxford Street west of Oxford Circus and as low as 6 per cent even east of Marks &amp; Spencer's Pantheon site beyond which tenant quality falls off dramatically. H &amp; B's Tim Sketchley even predicts that the north side of Oxford Street East will show the greatest improvement in both yields and rents. Part of the reason lies in the historic concentration of properties in this stretch into just a few long-term hands such as Grand Metropolitan, London &amp; Manchester and Standard Life. But a new factor is the imminent redevelopment of the Virgin Megastore for Pounds 90m. Once Virgin and Grand Met agreed the details, Grand Met put the property on the market as a completed and fully let development. Contracts should be exchanged very shortly at a price expected to reflect the rejuvenation the rebuilding will create. Longer term, the quality of the far east end of Oxford Street will also improve when London Underground completes the upgrading of the Charing Cross Road entrance to Tottenham Court Road station. Oxford Street has always been a cyclical market, dependent on tourism as well as domestic consumer cycles. Today's top rents - Pounds 240 per square foot Zone A, west of the Circus - are just the same as they were in 1979 and a long way from the early 1980s peak of Pounds 350. But Mr Sketchley confirms that they are in a steep upward phase at present. On those grounds - and with the boost from the Megastore and Underground improvement - he is confident that rents of Pounds 100 to Pounds 140 in the eastern stretch will soon be historic and deals will produce benchmark yields. The buyers prepared to pay such prices will most likely be British (no offence to Irish Life which recently acquired a site just west of the Pantheon at a price reflecting a 5 per cent yield). As with offices, foreign investors are now taking more of a back seat in the retail investment market.</p>

			<p><P> February 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SAN FRANCISCO;  </P> <P> AIDS PROTEST JAMS BRIDGE  </P> <P> About 14,000 cars were backed up on the Golden Gate Bridge during rush hour on  the first anniversary of last year's AIDS sit-in on the span, the California  Highway Patrol said. The traffic jam resulted from rubber-necking by motorists  watching 150 demonstrators with signs and loudspeakers standing on the sidewalk  from mid-span to the toll plaza, and the backup extended north to Mill Valley,  officers said.  </P> <P> The demonstration was conducted by members of SANOE, an acronym for Stop AIDS  Now or Else. The CHP had a helicopter in the air and 35 officers near the scene  on overtime. "A whole lot of money went for overtime that could have gone for  AIDS research," CHP Officer Bill Wylie said. Last year, a huge traffic jam  occurred when 65 SANOE members sat in the roadway.  </P></p>

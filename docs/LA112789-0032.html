			<p><P> November 27, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PHILIPPINES  </P> <P> As a former Peace Corps volunteer in the Philippines (from 1985 to 1987) I was  struck by the accuracy of John Cavanagh and Robin Broad's critique of economic  "development" programs there ("Aim 'People's Power' to the People," Op-Ed Page,  Nov. 7).  </P> <P> In my experience, major development programs in the Philippines are little more  than a way for local politicians and government officials to line their pockets  -- either by awarding contracts to relatives and cronies or by stealing grant  funds outright. In fact, one development official I talked to candidly admitted  that his country's economic-development grants always included an extra 30% for  "administrative costs" -- shorthand for the cost of graft.  </P> <P> It is difficult to see how this can be changed. In a country where even  government employees can't feed their families on their salaries alone, graft  may merely mean survival for some.  </P> <P> The great majority of Filipinos living below the poverty line want little more  than a plot of land with which to feed their families. President Corazon  Aquino's failure (or perhaps unwillingness) to address this fundamental concern  has turned her "people's power" revolution on its head and restored to power  the very people who are the causes of inequality in the Philippines -- the  oligarchic elite.  </P> <P> What should be even more appalling to us as Americans is that our foreign-aid  dollars are helping to fund -- and, indeed, legitimate -- this mess.  </P> <P> DAVID FROSSARD  </P> <P> Irvine  </P></p>

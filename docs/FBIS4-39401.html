			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Gleb Cherkasov report under the "Continuers" rubric: "`New </F> Names' Casts Off `Russia's Future'"]    [Text] The electoral association "Russia's Future -- New  Names," which failed to clear the 5-percent hurdle in the race  for deputy seats, now has a successor. The other day the  Justice Ministry registered an interregional movement calling  itself "New Names," which has been joined by some participants  in the electoral bloc of the same name, including federal ticket  leaders Vladimir Mironov, director of the Institute of Politics;  and Oleg Sokolov, chairman of the youth organization of the  Russian Social Democratic People's Party. At the same time,  Vyacheslav Lashchevskiy, chairman of the Russian Youth Union,  who used to head the electoral bloc, will not take part in the  forming of the new organization. "New Names" intends to adhere  to a social democratic trend and keep in touch with all public  political associations far removed from extremism.    To date, "New Names" has six regional organizations in  Tataria [Tatarstan], Bashkiria [Bashkortostan], and Tambov,  among other places. According to "New Names" spokesman Artem  Smolyannoy, primary organizations were set up in those regions  where the electoral association managed more than 5 percent of  the vote. Mr. Smolyannoy pointed out that although many  activists of "Rutskoy's Party" participate in the work of the  new organization, most of the participants in the project have  nothing to do with the Russian Social Democratic People's Party.  This perhaps explains why "New Names" is quite ready to accede  to the Treaty on Accord. (Their signature is not there yet  because they have not been invited to add it).</p>

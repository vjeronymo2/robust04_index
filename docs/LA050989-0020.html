			<p><P> May 9, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> EARNINGS  </P> <P> Sharply lower revenue for the third quarter of fiscal 1989 resulted in a loss  of $1.9 million for Computer Automation Inc. The company reported a profit of  $42,000 for the same period a year ago. Revenue for the 3 months ended March 31  fell 51%, to $2.8 million from $5.8 million. For the 9-month period, Computer  Automation incurred a loss of $1.2 million, contrasted with a year-earlier  profit of $743,000. Revenue declined 23%, to $13.4 million from the $17.3  million of the previous year. George Pratt, chairman and chief executive, said  that most of the revenue decline was caused by a continuing lag in orders for  the automatic test equipment manufactured by the company.  </P></p>

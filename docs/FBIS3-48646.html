			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Hong Kong, Jan. 26 (YONHAP) -- Pyongyang and Beijing  have agreed to jointly develop Chongjin port in northwestern  North Korea, and build a road and at least two hotels in the  city, the DAGONG BAO newspaper reported Wednesday.    The pro-Beijing daily, in a report from Changchun City in  Jilin Province, called the agreement a measure to accelerate the  birth of a northeast Asian economic triangle centered on the  Tuman River.    The triangle runs from Chongjin port in North Korea to Yanji  City in China and Vladivostok in Russia -- all near the Tuman  River.    The United Nations Development Program (UNDP), South and  North Korea, China, Russia and Japan are trying to develop the  Tuman River basin as a special economic zone.    The state-run Yanji Trading Co. of China has, in a series of  contacts with North Korea, agreed to invest 370 million yuan (37  million U.S. dollars) in joint development of Chongjin.    When the project is completed, South Korean, Taiwanese,  U.S.,  Japanese and Hong Kong ships will be allowed to call at the  port, the paper said.    It did not reveal the amount of investment by North Korea.    Under the agreement, Yanji will jointly develop the port  with  North Korea, build a 95km-long road between Chongjin and  Hoeryong and erect a hotel with a floor space of 30,000 square  meters.    The paper said that the joint development will greatly  increase the berth and cargo handling capacity of Chongjin port  and promote economic cooperation and trade between northeast  Asian countries.</p>

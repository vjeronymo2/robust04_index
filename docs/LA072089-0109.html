			<p><P> July 20, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: SANTA MONICA;  </P> <P> COUNCILMAN FACES FINES  </P> <P> City Councilman Ken Genser faces nearly $1,200 in fines for failing to file his  campaign financial statement.  </P> <P> Genser said his statement, which reports contributions made to the Friends of  Ken Genser Committee from Oct. 27 through Dec. 31, 1988, is almost six months  late because he has been too busy with personal and city business. Genser was  elected to the City Council last November.  </P> <P> Under state law, a candidate must be fined $10 a day for each day the report is  not filed after a written notice has been sent to the office seeker. City Clerk  Clarice E. Johnsen sent Genser written notice on March 21 that his report had  been due Jan. 31.  </P> <P> Johnsen said that Genser's former campaign treasurer, Roger Thornton, who  resigned last month over the matter but has agreed to help Genser file the  report, told her that the statement would be filed this week.  </P> <P> Thornton could not be reached for comment.  </P></p>

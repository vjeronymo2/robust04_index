			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / Mr Mole wants to bury TV diggers Mr Terry Cohn is trying to become a mole in the multi-million pound cable television industry. His aim is to penetrate the cable companies and persuade them to stop digging up the streets when they lay their cable networks, often leaving unsightly 'scars' behind. His interest however is more to do with business than the urban environment. Mr Cohn is managing director of Powermole International, a company that manages to lay cables and pipes without having to dig up the streets. 'The need for trenching is a thing of the past. The alternative is not only quicker but significantly cheaper,' Mr Cohn said yesterday. The moles, already at work for British Gas, are pneumatically powered. A piston strikes an anvil in front of the casing and propels the mole through the ground, compacting the earth as it goes. The mole, Mr Cohn says, can construct a 100-metre hole in a single stretch travelling at the rate of one metre a minute. A cable can then either be inserted in the hole or the mole can pull the cable through as it goes. 'I am not sure why the cable industry has been hesitant to use moles rather than trenching,' said Mr Cohn, pointing out that moles were used to build cable networks in both France and Germany. He hopes to be able to demonstrate his British-made machines - which cost between Pounds 5,000 and Pounds 10,000 - to the cable industry. Yesterday, Mr Cohn staged a demonstration for senior British Gas engineers at Sittingborne, Kent. The mole went into an old cast iron gas pipe, smashing it as it went while at the same time pulling a new pipe behind it. Powermole International hopes it will finally make a similar impact on the cable industry.</p>

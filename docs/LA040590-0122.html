			<p><P> April 5, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: SANTA MONICA;  </P> <P> FUND-RAISER TALK ON GANGS  </P> <P> Gangs will be the topic of discussion at an April 18 fund-raiser luncheon for  Teen Line, a hot line that uses trained volunteer teen-agers to listen to the  problems of their peers.  </P> <P> "People's Court" Judge Joseph A. Wapner will introduce a veteran gang member  and a gang interventionist who will present an "explicit firsthand look at  gangs in our community," according to Teen Line program coordinator Elaine  Leader.  </P> <P> The subject was chosen because an increasing number of calls to the hot line  pertain to fears and worries about gangs, Leader said.  </P> <P> The hot line, which has been in operation since 1981, has received more than  80,000 calls involving a whole range of problems facing teens, including drugs,  suicide, and physical and sexual abuse, Leader said.  </P> <P> Teen Line is staffed with volunteer teen-agers who are supervised by mental  health professionals. It is affiliated with Cedars-Sinai Medical Center.  </P> <P> Proceeds of the luncheon, which will be held at the Loews Hotel in Santa  Monica, will go to support the toll-free line, (800) TLC-TEEN.  </P></p>

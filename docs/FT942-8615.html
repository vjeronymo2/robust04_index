			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / International Company News: Gutfreund loses Salomon action Mr John Gutfreund, former chairman of Salomon Brothers who resigned amid a bond market scandal three years ago, failed yesterday to get the Wall Street firm to hand over Dollars 55.3m of salary, bonuses, stock options and other penalties. A New York Stock Exchange arbitration panel decided against Mr Gutfreund and in favour of Salomon. Mr Gutfreund claimed Salomon unfairly withheld the compensation after his resignation in August 1991. When he launched his claim in 1992, he sought about Dollars 12m from Salomon, but the claim grew during the intervening years as the value of the disputed stock options soared and as Mr Gutfreund sought various penalties, unpaid interest and legal fees. Mr Gutfreund stepped down as chairman of Salomon three years ago after it was revealed that he and several senior executives had failed to report that Salomon's chief bond trader had faked customer orders for government securities in a series of Treasury auctions. He was fined for failing to properly supervise his employees and banned from running a brokerage firm. Salomon declined to comment on the stock exchange panel's judgment.</p>

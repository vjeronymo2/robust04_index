			<p><P> November 27, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SANTA CLARITA GROWTH PLAN PROPOSES CAP OF 475 UNITS  </P> <P> A citizens group that hopes to put a growth-control initiative on the ballot in  Santa Clarita released a statement Monday saying the measure would allow only  475 new housing units to be built in the city a year.  </P> <P> Such a cap would be below present building trends in the city.  </P> <P> Since Santa Clarita incorporated three years ago, the City Council has approved  1,717 houses, apartments and condominiums, roughly 572 units a year, according  to a recent city report. The council also approved 429 other residential units  during that time, but those projects had already received preliminary approval  from Los Angeles County, the report said.  </P> <P> The press release announcing the proposed building cap was accidentally issued  two days early by members of the Citizen's Assn. for a Responsible Residential  Initiative on Growth, or CARRING. The group had planned to release a draft of  the slow-growth initiative Wednesday.  </P> <P> John Drew, chairman of the group, would not confirm or deny the information in  the press release and said the group would discuss the initiative Wednesday.  Drew would only say that the figure of 475 housing units was not official.  </P> <P> CARRING has been working on the initiative for months, and city officials and  local developers have been awaiting its release.  </P> <P> The press release said the initiative would allow "475 homes a year," but it  was unclear whether the figure referred to only single-family houses or all  dwelling units. The release did not detail how the 475 figure was reached, but  said it reflected growth trends in Los Angeles County in the 1980s.  </P> <P> A public opinion poll commissioned by the Santa Clarita City Council this year  showed strong support for a growth-control measure in the Santa Clarita Valley.  </P> <P> The poll, released in June, found that 78% of those polled would strongly or  somewhat support an initiative to slow growth. The poll had a margin of error  of plus or minus 4 percentage points.  </P></p>

			<p>920113 FT  13 JAN 92 / Dishes may top 3m in 1992: FT Satellite Monitor THE NUMBER of UK homes with satellite television dishes will exceed 3m this year - one in seven households - according to a new forecast, Raymond Snoddy writes. The prediction from Continental Research, an independent market research group, is that a further 1.1m satellite dishes will be installed in 1992 as satellite television expands in its core market - families with young children. Last year Continental forecast that dish installations would reach 2.2m by the end of 1991. According to the FT Satellite Monitor produced by Continental, 116,000 installations in December brought the total at the end of the year to 2.13m. The first three weeks of December were particularly strong, with the weekly average rising to 33,000 compared with 27,000 in November. The December figure was the highest since the introduction of satellite television in the UK.</p>

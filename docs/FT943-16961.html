			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: Inchcape Viewed in a positive light, Inchcape's decision not to increase its stake in Gestetner can be seen as a reaffirmation of the company's commendably cautious approach to acquisitions. Rather than make a blind bid for the whole of Gestetner a year ago, Inchcape preferred to proceed on a suck-it-and-see basis by buying a 15 per cent stake, two seats on the board and the chance to peruse the internal accounts. The acquisition of a Pounds 3m option gave Inchcape the chance to buy more if it liked what it saw. That it has not is no disgrace. The more negative interpretation, though, would be to question what Inchcape was up to in the first place. Given Inchcape's long-standing relationship with Ricoh, it was always going to be tricky to deepen its involvement with Gestetner. It is understandable that Ricoh would want to keep its distribution options open. That suggests Inchcape's adventure was was somewhat misconceived from the start. Inchcape has been left with a fair chunk of capital and management resource tied up in a different business. Inchcape may be able to develop some useful trading relationships with Gestetner in the far east but the linkage must count as a strategic diversion. Still, Inchcape has more pressing issues to worry about. The inexorable rise of the yen against the dollar will be causing greater headaches given Inchcape's reliance on selling Japanese goods abroad.</p>

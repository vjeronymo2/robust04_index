			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Net assets decline at Murray Intl Net asset value at Murray International Trust fell from 381.9p to 324.2p over the six months to June 30. However, it was ahead of the 310.6p reported 12 months earlier. Net revenue for this investment trust in the half year to the end of June was lower at Pounds 8.06m (Pounds 8.35m). The company has adopted FRS 4 covering the treatment of finance costs and has decided to allocate 60 per cent of the costs to capital and the balance to income. The comparatives have been adjusted. Earnings per share came out at 6.8p (7.05p) or 6.71p (6.96p) fully converted. As already forecast the company is paying three interim dividends of 2.7p, but is now forecasting a 1994 final of 3.9p. It also expects to pay an interim of 8.7p in three instalments for 1995.</p>

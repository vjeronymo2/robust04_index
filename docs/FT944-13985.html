			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / International Company News: Capital Cities/ABC soars 71% in quarter Capital Cities/ABC, the US entertainment and media group, yesterday reported a 71 per cent increase in third-quarter profits to Dollars 133.7m, or 87 cents a share. The strong results were achieved in the wake of another impressive performance from its network and cable television businesses, and a still-favourable advertising environment. Net revenues in the period totalled Dollars 1.46bn, up from Dollars 1.3bn in 1993. However, the group's profits failed to match the previous quarter, when Capital Cities earned Dollars 189.5m on revenues of Dollars 1.54bn. Also, earnings per share in the latest period were lifted by a 1993-94 stock repurchase programme which reduced the number of shares outstanding by almost 11m, to 154m. Capital Cities' television operations once again performed well in the quarter, with broadcasting revenues climbing 13 per cent to Dollars 1.2bn and operating income soaring 67 per cent to Dollars 212.8m. The latter figure was aided by the group's emphasis on keeping costs under control. Yesterday's results were broadly in line with Wall Street forecasts, and the shares rose Dollars  1/2 to close at Dollars 77 5/8.</p>

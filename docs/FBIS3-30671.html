Stanislav Devaty, director of the Czech Security and  Information Service (BIS), told CTK today that he knew nothing  about such an offer by counterintelligence service members to  the ODS.    Last summer, Cermak called reports that the ODS had tried to  create its own intelligence service "absolute nonsense." "The  ODS has no intelligence service," he said at that time, adding  that the party had never made any effort to create one.    Miroslav Macek, former ODS deputy chairman, told Czech  Television last year that employees of the FBIS, the BIS'  federal counterpart, proposed setting up a "mini-network" to  protect the party from information leaks and to gather  information on other political parties. Macek said he had  rejected the offer.    According to today's MLADA FRONTA DNES, FBIS employees had a  similar project prepared for the Civic Democratic Alliance. All  those who offered the services to the ODS left the FBIS in 1991  and 1992, the paper writes.</p>

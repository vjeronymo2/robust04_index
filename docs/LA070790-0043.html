			<p><P> July 7, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> OFFICIALS TAKE RACEWAY WIN FROM BRADER  </P> <P> It was easy come, easy go for Lynn Brader at Ventura Raceway on Friday night.  </P> <P> Brader, of Somis, squeezed between a pair of cars on the front straightaway of  the final lap of the Street Stock 15-lap oval main event for an apparent  victory. But the aggressive move was apparently too aggressive for the  officials, who penalized Brader for rough driving and dropped him to fourth  place, giving Brett Miller of Oxnard his first main-event win of the season.  </P> <P> Don Keeter of Ventura was awarded second with third going to Bill Famularo of  Simi Valley.  </P> <P> Things were not quite so wild in the Mini Stock 20-lap oval main event as  Ventura's Marty Desbrow drove to his second consecutive victory, boosting his  season points leadership over Chris Raschke of Ventura, who finished third.  </P> <P> Paul Moore of Oxnard finished second.  </P> <P> Jim Firsich of Port Hueneme padded his figure-eight season points lead with an  easy victory in the six-lap main event. Scott Olsen of Ventura was second and  Miller third.  </P> <P> Joe Silva of Port Hueneme went wire-to-wire to win the Mini Stock eight-lap  figure-eight main event. The victory moved Silva within 100 points of season  points leader Richard Webster of Camarillo, who finished fourth.  </P> <P> Terry Swauger of Ojai and John Csorba of Oxnard were second and third,  respectively.  </P> <P> Eight-lap Mini Stock heat-race winners were Mike Spencer of Oxnard, Kevin  Parker of Ventura and Raschke. Street Stock heat winners were Don Famularo of  Simi Valley and Bill Pate of Oxnard.  </P> <P> Gary Swenson of Ventura outclassed the field to win the Mini Stock 10-lap  semi-main event to head-up a four-car contingent qualifying for the main event.  Also moving up were Ken Hewitt of Moorpark, Spencer, and Brandon King of  Oxnard.  </P> <P> Six-lap Trophy Dash winners were Keeter in the Street Stocks and Webster in the  Mini Stocks.  </P> <P> Fast one-lap qualifying times were set by Jim Powell Jr. of Cypress in the  Street Stocks, at 16.865 seconds, and Desbrow in the Mini Stocks at 17.767.  </P> <P> The Winged Outlaw Mini Sprints from the San Joaquin Valley area will make their  only appearance of the season at the Raceway tonight at 7.  </P> <P> The Mini Stocks will also be running with a double-points, double-purse  program.  </P></p>

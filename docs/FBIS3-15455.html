The voice sounded calm and seemed not to have changed at all.  Vice President [as published] Aleksandr Rutskoy said that he  would not grant an interview to journalists for a month, but he  did not refuse to speak to IZVESTIYA's correspondent.    [Ivanidze] What do you intend to do?    [Rutskoy] I want to see how the land lies. I want to  understand what is happening around me now. In my view, the  picture is rather dismal. They have been quite unable to  abandon police methods. Everything remains as in former times.  My telephone is tapped, believe me. External observation is  hardly concealed. Not that all this is so terrible.... But  what happened last October.... I believe that time will judge  us. [Rutskoy ends]    When he started speaking of the October events, I admit I  was  prepared to hear the usual accusatory words in such situations.  We are the good guys, and they are the bad guys. The vice  president must be given his due. This did not happen. At a  certain moment it even seemed to me that Rutskoy was tormented  not so much by the bitterness of political defeat as by the  deaths of the people who took his side. "The most terrible  thing is that people died. They were not a rabble, as is being  written. They were normal young people of very diverse  professions.... It could all have been different," Aleksandr  Vladimirovich said.    It is interesting that throughout the conversation he did  not  once mention his court actions against IZVESTIYA. Even when I  asked him about the court and the millions of rubles in  compensation, he did not at once understand what I was talking  about. "ARGUMENTY I FAKTY telephoned me and asked me to drop  the case. But I cannot do that. I could not reply to anyone  when I was held in Lefortovo, when all these `documents' were  published.... I don't want money. I want apologies."    Does the vice president understand that after the elections  to the State Duma he has become the most dangerous person for  everyone? That the "spiritual" opposition, having secured seats  in the Duma, now sees him as a serious rival to its leaders in  the next presidential election? The amnesty puts Rutskoy in the  position of someone on a gallows who could have the stool kicked  from under his feet at any moment. When I told Rutskoy that  even the communist PRAVDA speaks of him as a general sent by  Yeltsin into the opposition in order to split it, Rutskoy took a  deep breath and said with irritation:    "You know, I lost faith in all sorts of `-isms' even before  people started handing in their party cards."</p>

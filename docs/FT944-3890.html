			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Where have all the cheap whites gone? - Jancis Robinson finds out, and selects some more plums from merchants and supermarkets for festive drinking / Wine I could name any number of good, interesting, cheap red wines. There is Kwik save's Steep Ridge Grenache-Shiraz 1993, Pounds 2.49 - a Vin de Pays d'Oc from southern France trying desperately to look like an Australian but tastes very southern Rhone with its frank, full, vigorous fruit, all sweet and spicy. Or Safeway's special Christmas offer of a perfectly sound Minervois at just Pounds 2.15, for example. There's also Debut Bulgarian Cabernet, Pounds 2.99 at Victoria Wine, a hi-tech wine made from low temperature fermentation to produce a very clean, correct, if slightly dull wine aimed at those who find other Bulgarians just too ethnic. Victoria Wine also has the deep crimson, fruity, smooth and equally modern Puerta de la Villa Cencibel Valdepenas 1993 at Pounds 2.99 which would also make a perfectly acceptable house wine for all but the grandest parties this Christmas. But where are all the interesting, cheap whites? I can quite see why wineries have to charge a bit more in the first few years of modern white wine production, to pay for the necessary gentle presses and temperature control, but is that era not behind us? Only South Africa seems to want passionately to play in the white-wine-under-Pounds 3 paddock (as witness several aggressive special offers), and is exporting oceans of technically correct, crisp dry white, much of it made from Colombard. Supermarkets can offer the best deals here. Eastern Europe is also doing its best (despite presumably having made some fairly recent investments in plant) and Safeway's special Christmas white at Pounds 2.15 is a clean, full-bodied Hungarian Chardonnay. But, while cheap South African white may lack character, some eastern European cheap white may have too much. Grapy flavours abound, which is not everyone's bowl of goulash. Perhaps it makes sense simply to swallow hard and pay a bit more for white wine with some real character, such as many of the appetising lemon-fresh, barrel-fermented Chardonnays from the new appellation of Limoux in the hills west of Corbieres in south-west France. Jean-Louis Denois is one of the area's most passionate exponents, particularly proud of his Domaine de l'Aigle, at Roquetaillade high in the eastern Pyrenean foothills. His Cuvee Classique 1992 is delicate, yet as fiercely concentrated as its maker. Tanners, of Shrewsbury Shropshire, sells it for about Pounds 7 a bottle. Rather similar in style is another relatively high altitude Chardonnay given de luxe oak treatment, Shaw &amp; Smith Reserve Chardonnay 1993, Pounds 10.99 at Winecellars, of London SW18 et al. The high country around Adelaide in South Australia is responsible in this case. Here is a wine to define that strange term 'elegant mouth feel' for what top-quality barrel fermentation does to a good white. This serious wine should continue to improve in bottle for at least two years. And it is heartening to see New Zealand Chardonnays also demonstrating mastery of traditional burgundian techniques, most notably with the recent release of two single vineyard bottlings from Montana, the giant of this small industry. Ormond and the rather more austere Renwick are both Pounds 10.99 chez Oddbins and others and are cleverly labelled and named after particularly promising sites in Marlborough. But these are wines to be drunk with food. For a house white that will serve either as aperitif or all-purpose lubricant, a gentler, more aromatic wine is needed. Riesling is the perfect candidate, and Dr Loosen Riesling either 1992 or 1993 is an excellent lively, off dry example costing about Pounds 6 at Thresher, Adnams of Southwold, Suffolk, and many other outlets. Oddbins has a particularly inspiring selection of German wines, notably from that hotbed of winemaking talent, the Pfalz region in south west Germany. The wines of Kurt Darting, Fuhrmann Eymael (Pfeffingen), Lingenfelder, Muller Catoir are racy, concentrated and extremely versatile. Both the open 1992s and the denser 1993s are tasting delicious at the moment. Those who just won't give Riesling a chance had better try Pinot Blanc 1992 Marcel Deiss, about Pounds 7.45 from Lea &amp; Sandeman, of London SW10 and Adnams of Southwold. This scented, pure Alsace white would make a house wine extraordinaire, with more zest and undertow than the average Pinot Blanc (although in general Alsace's Pinot Blancs are the region's best value wines). House reds should probably be relatively snappy, sappy and not too heavy. Great Plain Kekfrankos 1993, Pounds 3.49 Safeway, is beguilingly lively with lots of fruit and an aroma that attracts those of us with a penchant for this Danubian answer to cru Beaujolais. Sainsbury's Teroldego Rotaliano Pounds 3.95, made by Australian Geoff Merrill, is another example of this inky style of red that is probably flattered by being served very slightly cool. Bordeaux may make many a keenly-priced Sauvignon/ Semillon white, but its reds are rarely suitable for drinking without food. Nevertheless there is keen activity in the red bordeaux market and several British retailers are anxious to remind their customers of Bordeaux's particularly digestible red wines so suitable for the table. Thresher/Bottoms Up/Wine Rack has some keen selections currently, and Safeway has lopped Pounds 3 off the price of its better clarets such as Ch Leoville Barton 1992, Pounds 13.49 down to Pounds 10.49. Wines from this vintage have to be chosen with care, but this one, always sensibly priced, is well-judged and could already be drunk with great pleasure. More red wines too powerful or tannic for sipping without food include the big, oaky Cosme Palacio 1990 Rioja Pounds 4.99, Safeway and Oddbins, as lush and full bodied as Michel Rolland's more usual output in Pomerol. Those combing unlikely branches of Victoria Wine and Safeway may still find bottles of La Cuvee Mythique 1991 at about Pounds 5.50. This herby red is one of the most interesting bottlings of Val d'Orbieu, the Languedoc's largest growers association, being an oak-aged blend of some of their most powerful Vins de Pays. There is just as much character, though of a very different kind, in Laytons of London NW1's Barbera del Monferrato 1986 at Pounds 6.75. This is poor man's Barolo and none the worse for it. This intensely spicy Barbera fruit comes from Carlo Cassinis' particularly mature Vigne del Sole vineyard which is vinified separately only in the best vintages. Four years in large oak casks and two in bottle have resulted in a delightfully recognisable, yet accessible tangy Piedmontese red. And finally, an Australian classic (yes, it already exists), Penfolds Coonawarra Cabernet Sauvignon 1990 or 1991, widely stocked at Pounds 7.99. This much-decorated wine has an amazing colour and carries it weight well. Wynns Coonawarra Cabernet Sauvignon 1991, Pounds 7.49 Oddbins, is no slouch either, and would also make a thoroughly enjoyable Christmas bottle.</p>

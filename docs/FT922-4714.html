			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Put back in its place by a parent - David Barchard on the turnround at Marine Midland / The Battle for Midland THREE YEARS ago Marine Midland, the US subsidiary of Hongkong Bank, was an ambitious money centre bank battling against a hostile environment. Today it has settled down to something more like its his-torical origins as a regional niche player, back in profit and relying on retail banking and small businesses in its home state. In between lies a period when the bank lost nearly half a billion dollars in two years and Hongkong Bank was obliged to pour in top management and new capital to nurse it back to financial health. For Hongkong Bank, now battling with Lloyds in a Pounds 3.9bn bid for Midland Bank of the UK, the experience shows the pitfalls of entering a new market and leaving things to local management. It also suggests however that, faced with a seriously troubled subsidiary, Hongkong Bank has the management capacity to make a swift and successful response. 'We are now well capitalised, generously reserved, and very liquid,' says Mr Keith Whitson, executive director. Hongkong Bank's connection with Marine Midland, which has no historical connection with its UK namesake, dates back to 1978. Traditionally Marine Midland had been a large and rather conservative New York State regional bank with 316 branches, established in the second half of the last century and based in Buffalo near the Great Lakes in the north east of the state. At the end of the 1970s Marine Midland hankered after diversification into more exciting activities such as investment banking and lending to developing countries without having the necessary capital base to do so. When Hongkong Bank bought 51 per cent of its equity, while agreeing to leave its board and management in place for at least five years, Marine Midland seemed on course for its planned diversification. Things went well for most of the 1980s. In 1987 Hongkong bought the remaining 49 per cent of Marine Midland's stock. Two years later, lending mistakes made during the 1980s came home to roost. Provi-sions for loan losses climbed to Dollars 414.3m, rising to Dollars 557.3m the following year. A Dollars 13.8m profit in 1989 became a horrific loss of Dollars 295.6m in 1990. Things were not much better in 1991 when the bank lost Dollars 189.9m. Marine Midland was one of three loss-making subsidiaries in the group, the others being Hongkong Bank of Australia and James Capel, its London stockbroker. The subsequent turnaround has been achieved partly by putting in top management from the rest of the group, a process which culminated in the appointment in June 1991 of Mr John Bond, a Hongkong Bank main board director, as president and chief executive officer in place of Mr Geoffrey Thompson. In October 1991, Hongkong Bank injected Dollars 200m in new capital. The strategy behind the turn around involved a drastic change in the bank's business areas and the shrinking of its loan book. Key points in the strategy were: Falling back on Marine Midland's traditional core business in retail banking and lending to medium and small businesses in New York state; Cutting costs Withdrawing from more than a dozen activities including motor finance, national real estate lending, international private banking, equipment leasing, and leveraged buy-outs. Reducing developing country debt exposure. Marine Midland's developing country debt portfolio shrank from Dollars 1.13bn at the end of 1989 to about Dollars 17.1m early this year. By the beginning of 1992, light was beginning to show at the end of the tunnel. Losses in the final quarter of the year were Dollars 23.8m, compared to Dollars 164.3m in the last quarter of 1990. In the first quarter of this year Marine Midland reported earnings of Dollars 2.6m up from losses of Dollars 72.3m in that period in 1991. One result of all this is that Marine Midland is now a smaller but cleaner bank with a strong capital base. Total assets have fallen from Dollars 27.06bn in 1989 to Dollars 16.94bn at the end of last year, while its total loan book is down from Dollars 22.67bn in 1989 to Dollars 10.48bn at present. Staff numbers have been trimmed from 13,538 at the start of 1990 to 10,450 two years later. With the bank back in profit, the shrinking process is now over. What is left is a bank which relies almost entirely on retail deposits for its funding and only slightly on wholesale funds. Having devoted so much time on it, Marine Midland's parent will now presumably want to sit back and enjoy some of the rewards. In the longer term, there may be a question about the exact role an up-state regional bank, albeit one based in the retail finance activities in which the Hongkong Group is also a specialist, has inside a global bank.</p>

			<p>930621 FT  21 JUN 93 / International Company News: Coup chalked up by Nordquote THE NORDIC stock exchanges are expecting to strengthen their position in the highly competitive European securities markets with a trade-supporting information system, dubbed Nordquote. The Nordic exchanges - in Copenhagen, Helsinki, Oslo and Stockholm - have stolen a march on the rest of Europe, where attempts to agree European-wide systems, such as Euroquote, have come to nothing. The Nordic decision is essentially defensive. By creating a single market for Nordic securities - initially only for blue-chip equities - the Nordics hope to win back business which has gone to London's Seaq International, where a substantial part of the trade in leading Nordic stocks is done. Taken singly, Mr Bent Mebus, managing director of the Copenhagen Stock Exchange, said the four small Nordic markets tend to be regarded as too small and exotic, but brought together, the joint market should prove more attractive. However, the Nordics do not see Nordquote as an alternative to any European system of the Euroquote type. While the Nordics maintain that progress towards European stock exchange co-operation has been so slow it is not expedient to await a European solution, they see their move as a contribution to the formation of a European stock exchange structure. Nordquote has also to be seen in the light of the EC's Investment Services Directive, which will come into force in 1996 and give brokers in any EC country access to the markets of any other member country. The system, when it opens on April 1 next year, will quote only about 20 of the stocks in which there is a significant international interest. The list will gradually be increased to around 100 stocks, and other securities, such as bonds and derivatives, may be introduced. For the international investor, the system means he or she need only approach one broker in any of the Nordic countries to trade in the stocks listed on Nordquote. This is expected to make the Nordic market more attractive, not least by increasing market liquidity. Nordquote will be open only for Nordic brokers and will be an interactive system enabling brokers, through their national stock exchange, to indicate bid and offer prices in selected securities. Trading will take place on the telephone and as long as the system remains an information exchange, not an actual trading system, the rules and regulations applied by each of the four countries will not have to be modified. Trading will be in accordance with the rules of the country where the security is listed, and the national settlement procedures will apply. There is a considerable degree of co-operation between Nordic bourses, including an electronic network. This will be adapted for Nordquote, with each stock exchange responsible for development and maintenance of its own part of the system. Each exchange will meet the expenses of developing and operating the system. It is estimated setting up Nordquote will cost DKr3m (Dollars 484,000), or DKr750,000 per exchange.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] A responsible source has said the Republic of Yemen  is fully committed to the UN Security Council's call for a  cease-fire, holding the forces rebelling against the legitimate  authority fully responsible for the continued cease-fire  violations. The source said that through their cease-fire  violations, those forces are jeopardizing innocent citizens'  lives and seeking to destroy vital and strategic institutions  and installations throughout the Republic.    Referring to the wicked objectives the rebels seek to  achieve  through continued military operations, despite the state's  genuine commitment and practical initiatives in this regard, the  source explained that the rebels want to internationalize the  issue in the service of treasonous stands.    Meanwhile, the responsible source said the Government of the  Republic of Yemen is amazed and disturbed by the U.S. State  Department's official spokesman's statement, which is not based  on what is actually taking place on the ground. The source said  the legitimate forces have, in practice, proved their commitment  to the UN Security Council resolution and that the rebels are  taking advantage of this commitment to attack legitimate forces  with all their weapons, something which is testified to by their  military statements.</p>

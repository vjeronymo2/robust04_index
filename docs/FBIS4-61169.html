			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Linda Choy and Doreen Cheung] </F>   [Text] The top Chinese official in charge of Hong Kong, Lu  Ping, yesterday broke his silence over his refusal to meet the  Governor Chris Patten, saying the atmosphere was not good enough  to facilitate a fruitful exchange.    In his first public speech since arriving on Sunday, Mr. Lu  said China and Britain had to iron out their differences through  meetings at various levels before the two sat down for talks.    Chinese officials had previously suggested Mr. Lu could not  meet Mr. Patten because the director was too busy.    Noting that the Government had barred civil servants from  contacts with the Preliminary Working Committee (PWC), the  China- appointed working panel for the Special Administrative  Region, Mr. Lu said the atmosphere remained bad.    "The Hong Kong Government has not been very friendly towards  the PWC," he said. "If the situation is like that, a meeting  between us will bear no fruit.    "Thus, it will be better to start the negotiations at the  lower level. When discussions at those forums manage to  progress, then we shall meet to see if we can achieve something  at this level," said Mr. Lu, director of the Hong Kong and Macao  Affairs Office.    He said the two countries were continuing their discussions  about the transition of Hong Kong via the Airport Committee and  the Sino- British Joint Liaison Group (JLG).    "I believe that we can reach an airport proposal acceptable  to both sides soon," Mr. Lu said. "The questions related to the  financing arrangement and the legislation on the airport  management authority are both under discussion. I hope there  will be a quick agreement."    Mr. Lu sidestepped a question as to whether his refusal to  meet Mr. Patten was in breach of the 1991 memorandum of  understanding on the new airport and related issues. "I came to  Hong Kong as the deputy director and secretary-general of the  PWC to participate in the meetings of political and economic  sub-groups," he said.    Under the memorandum, the director and the Governor should  hold regular meetings. Mr. Lu refused to say when he would meet  Mr. Patten. "I hope sometime in the future, when there is a  better atmosphere."    PWC member Raymond Wu Wai-yung defended Mr. Lu's decision to  snub Mr. Patten. He said China had to send a clear signal to  Britain that Beijing would not bow to pressure.    Meanwhile, it was confirmed yesterday that Sino-British  defence experts would meet again next week to resolve the  outstanding problems of a draft accord on the disposal of  military land. The meeting of the JLG would be held from May 10  to May 13, the Government said.    Next week's session is crucial, because a successful outcome  will facilitate the confirmation of a final agreement in the  upcoming plenum of the JLG to be held in Hong Kong this month.</p>

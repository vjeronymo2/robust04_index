			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / International Company News: Charges push ITT to Dollars 617m loss in final term ITT, the US conglomerate, yesterday reported a fourth-quarter net loss of Dollars 617m after one-time charges, but said net income would have been 52 per cent higher if special items were excluded. The company announced last month that it would be taking big fourth-quarter charges, notably one of Dollars 612m after tax at its finance subsidiary, ITT Financial, which included large loss provisions in its domestic unsecured consumer loan portfolio. The fourth-quarter loss was equivalent to Dollars 4.74 a share, compared with net income of Dollars 165m, or Dollars 1.20, in the same period last year. Sales and revenues were Dollars 5.7bn, up from Dollars 5.4bn. For the full year, ITT reported a loss of Dollars 885m, or Dollars 6.90 a share, compared with restated net income of Dollars 749m, or Dollars 5.49, in 1991. Sales and revenues totalled Dollars 21.7bn, up from Dollars 20.4bn. The full-year figures included a Dollars 622m, or Dollars 4.71 a share, gain from the sale of ITT's 30 per cent interest in Alcatel NV, the telecommunications products group; a Dollars 582m, or Dollars 4.41, third-quarter charge at the ITT Hartford insurance group; and a Dollars 580m charge for an accounting change. ITT Hartford reported a jump in fourth-quarter income from Dollars 90m to Dollars 178m, in spite of lower capital gains, thanks to 'favourable domestic casualty underwriting experience and higher north American life operations.' The automotive components business moved from a Dollars 7m loss to a Dollars 39m profit, which was attributed to 'higher anti-lock brake system volume along with the favourable results of continuing cost improvement actions.' However, ITT Financial reported heavy losses, due to the restructuring charges, and the electronic components business reported a loss of Dollars 100m, up from Dollars 38m.</p>

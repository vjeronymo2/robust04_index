			<p>BFN     [Text] All nuclear weapons on the territory of Belarus  belong to Russia, and it is moving them out in strict accordance  with the schedule. This was stated on Thursday by Defense  Minister Pavel Kozlovskiy after the session of the Commonwealth  defense ministers' council. He also voiced the conviction that  the whole nuclear arsenal will be removed and sent to Russia by  1999, as agreed by treaty, and perhaps even before then.</p>

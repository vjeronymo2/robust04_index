			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The "Japan-North Korea Provisional Nongovernmental  Accord on Fishing," which allows Japanese fishing boats to  operate within 200 nautical miles of North Korean waters, is  expected to expire at the end of this year. This was disclosed  on 25 December by a source familiar with Japan-North Korea  relations. The accord was first concluded between  nongovernmental organizations of the two countries in 1977, and  it has since been extended almost every two years. This time,  however, there have been no prospects for consultations on  extending the accord on the eve of its expiration. Difficult  relations between Japan and North Korea following the suspension  of normalization talks and the issue of North Korea's suspected  nuclear development are believed to have adversely affected the  extension of the accord.    If the accord is invalidated, it would make it impossible  for  Japanese fishermen in the Hokuriku and Sanin regions to continue  catching squid in the eastern waters near the Korean peninsula.  A North Korean source in Tokyo, however, says: "Japanese  fishermen usually begin catching squid in spring following a  three-month break from January to March, so they should not  suffer any damage for the time being."    Hajime Fukada, a member of the House of Councilors (from the  Social Democratic Party of Japan), plans to visit North Korea on  28 December to sound out North Korean intentions.</p>

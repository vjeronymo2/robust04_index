			<p>910422 FT  22 APR 91 / No alternative to a policy of rigour: Reaction to the current recession shows the strength of the consensus on economic policy in France There are three remarkable features in the current slowdown in the French economy. The first is that most economic forecasters believe France is now in a recession, which has arrived with surprising abruptness. The second is that it has failed to provoke any significant demand for a change of economic policy, let alone any general campaign for reflation. And the third, therefore, is that it seems to demonstrate how deeply the French are now conditioned by the consensus that there is no alternative to their existing anti-inflationary strategy of economic rigour. In four short months the diagnosis of the French economy has shifted from slowdown to recession. Two years ago it was bursting with vitality, with growth of 3.7 per cent. Last year the growth rate slowed to 2.8 per cent, but the government was still counting on 2.7 per cent for 1991. By last December the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) forecast for French growth in 1991 was down to 2.3 per cent. At the beginning of this year the government was still forecasting 2.2 per cent growth, but in its current economic assessment it has trimmed that figure back to a round 2 per cent. Yet the most recent evaluation by the National Statistical Institute (INSEE) now reckons on growth of no more than 1.5 per cent. The slowdown is likely to lead to a fresh upswing in unemployment recent years, remains one of the highest among leading OECD countries, after Italy and Spain. After peaking at 10.5 per cent in 1987, the unemployment rate declined very slowly to just under 9 per cent in the middle of last year. Thereafter it levelled out, and in the early months of this year it has started to edge up again, to 9.2 per cent, or a total of just over 2.5m. From a political point of view, this is one of the most sensitive aspects of the recession. And yet there is effectively no discussion of a reflationary option as an answer to the unemployment problem; quite the contrary. The slowdown in economic activity is inevitably being accompanied by a decline in tax revenues, and the fiscal shortfall is likely to be exacerbated by a rise in payments of unemployment benefit and minimum income allowances. But the government's response to the shortfall is a renewed determination at all costs to stick to its target budget deficit of FFr80bn (Pounds 7.9bn) for this year. Accordingly, Mr Michel Rocard, the prime minister, has imposed government spending cuts of FFr10bn, plus an additional cut in investment programmes. None of the conservative opposition parties has challenged the logic of Mr Rocard's decision. Within the rank and file of the ruling Socialist party, it has provoked some controversy, but only about the means, not about the ends: some deputies argued the case for increased taxation, others urged the raising of a special Gulf war loan; but almost none has queried the necessity of holding the line on the budget deficit of FFr80bn. The explanation for this broad-based consensus is that France has been pursuing a consistent economic strategy, without significant variation, for the past eight years, under both left-wing and right-wing governments; and by common consent it appears to be paying off. It was launched by the Socialists in 1983, when they abandoned their ill-starred 1981-82 rush for socialism; it was continued by the conservative Gaullists, when they won the 1986 general elections; and it has remained in force under the Socialists, after President Mitterrand's second victory in 1988. The overall strategy originated with the decision to put a stop to the series of three devaluations of the franc within the European Monetary System (EMS), in 1981, 1982 and 1983, amounting to a 26 per cent drop against the D-Mark, which accompanied the inflationary expansion of the socialist experiment. Arising logically out of the anti-devaluation stance came a radical decision to pursue an anti-inflation policy, with the explicit long-term aim of narrowing and, if possible, closing the inflationary gap between France and Germany. The critical first move in curbing inflation, after a temporary freeze on prices and wages in 1982, was the decision by Jacques Delors, then the finance minister, to abolish wage indexation in the public sector - or rather, to replace indexation based on past inflation with a wage system geared to expected inflation. Since the government intended to reduce inflation, this switch meant it could replace an accelerating wage-price spiral with a gradual wage squeeze. Besides helping to reduce inflation, the wage squeeze also implied a shift of resources back into the corporate sector. It was accompanied by specific tax incentives for company investment and, starting in 1986, a progressive reduction in corporate taxation. Thirdly, the anti-inflation strategy entailed a tight monetary policy, with a steep decline in the growth of domestic credit. In December 1982, the M2 money supply target for 1983 was set at 10 per cent; a year later, the 1984 target was set at 5.5-6.5 per cent. Fourthly and finally, it entailed the recovery of control of government spending, followed by a reduction in the budget deficit. Achieving the first part of this last objective took two years, since the budget deficit went on rising until 1985, when it peaked at FFr153bn; but since then it has been brought down steadily every year, and is expected this year to be no more than FFr80bn. At this level, it is by now rather modest, less than 1.2 per cent of gross domestic product. The problem is that the fiscal extravagance of earlier years still has to be paid for, in terms of the servicing of earlier public borrowings. Debt service as a share of total government spending has been rising steadily since 1980, and last year it cost just over FFr124bn; this was 9.7 per cent of the total budget, and made it the third-largest component of the budget after education and defence. This anti-inflation policy has been accompanied over the eight-year period by an uninterrupted process of structural adjustment through liberalisation and deregulation; and this process, too, was started by the Socialists, continued by the Gaullists, and resumed again by the Socialists: the dismantling of price controls, the removal of credit controls, the abolition of foreign exchange controls, the deregulation of financial markets, and the spasmodic withdrawal of government from industrial intervention. In fact, across the whole field of economic policy, there have been only two serious ideological quarrels between left and right during the past eight years: the wealth tax created by the Socialists, abolished by the Gaullists, and reinstated by the Socialists; and the battle over nationalisation/privatisation, which is now being put to rest by the government's decision to admit the principle that private shareholders can subscribe up to 49 per cent of the capital of state-owned companies. But if the French economy is now in reasonably good shape, there is widespread agreement that the process of recovery was essentially due to the four-part anti-inflation strategy. 'It is these four axes which have allowed the EMS to work,' says a senior Bank of France official. 'If you can reduce your costs, having a hard currency policy is an advantage, because it protects you against imported inflation. And the abolition of wage indexation was the most important factor, because wages account for two-thirds of total costs. 'The only problem,' he added, 'is that this process takes time; it took from 1983 to 1987 for the policy to work through.' For the French, the true test of their economic performance is the bilateral comparison with Germany. This is partly an indication of the political importance of the Franco-German relationship, partly a measure of the economic weight of Germany, and partly a recognition that German economic policy is (or has been) the litmus test for all the other members of the EC. But it is also a reflection of the weight of the bilateral economic relationship between France and Germany, each of which is the leading trading partner of the other. Nearly 19 per cent of French imports come from Germany, compared with only 11.6 per cent from Italy; while 17 per cent of French exports go to Germany, compared with 11 per cent to Italy. So it is not surprising that the French should set great store by the bilateral economic indicators, especially the inflation gap and the trade balance. Ever since they changed economic course in 1983, the French have steadily narrowed the interest-rate and inflation differentials with Germany, to the point where they have now nearly disappeared. The bilateral French trade deficit with Germany was still rather large last year, at FFr42bn; but it was significantly smaller than in 1989, and the month-by-month trend shows a steady improvement. As a result, Mr Vivien Levy-Garboua, who heads the economic strategy group for the state Planning Ministry, looks forward almost with fatalism to the prospect of French participation in an economic and monetary union in Europe. 'The European Monetary System already determines our interest rates, and we have no freedom for manoeuvre on budgetary policy. So Emu will not really change anything. Of course, it is a long, painful apprenticeship; but in any case, no one is proposing an alternative option.'</p>

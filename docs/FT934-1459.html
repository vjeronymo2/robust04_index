			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets: Profits in perplexity for German shares in 1993 - David Waller on Frankfurt's bourse performance The German stock market has been been profitable but perplexing during the course of 1993. Profitable, for as the year draws to its close, the DAX index of 30 leading shares looks set to close nearly 40 per cent higher than at the beginning of the year. Perplexing, because the share price rises - which range from 20 per cent in the building and cement sector to 50 per cent for insurance companies - have often been decoupled from fundamentals. 'The companies in the worst state have been the best performers,' comments Mr Tom Holmes, head of equity research at Schroder Munchmeyer Hengst in Frankfurt. 'I have been absolutely baffled by the differentiation between the performance of companies in the same sector.' He points out that in the topsy-turvy world of German equities, Volkswagen has outperformed the more resilient BMW, Viag has proved a better investment than the more robust RWE. . . and so on throughout the market. The performance of the market as a whole has been underpinned by at least three broad positive factors. The first is that German interest rates, already down dramatically from their peak in the summer of 1992, will continue to fall in 1994. Kleinwort Benson, for example, expects the discount rate to fall from 5.75 per cent now to 4 per cent or below by the end of next year. Disappointing data on money supply growth this week has done nothing to change this picture. M3, the Bundesbank's trusted measure of broad money, climbed at an annualised, seasonally adjusted rate of 7.2 per cent in November, up from 6.9 in October. But according to the Hypo-Bank, for one, inflation is set to drop towards the magic 2 per cent level by 1995, allowing the Bundesbank to carry on cutting rates. The second support for the market comes from companies' moves to rationalise their costs. The recognition that costs must be cut - however damaging to the social aspect of Germany's social market economy - is widespread in German industry. Companies such as Volkswagen, Lufthansa and Daimler-Benz, which are perceived to be the most aggressive in tackling costs, have been honoured with substantial price rises despite the dire earnings situation at each of the companies. The third positive factor is the weight of money seeking to find a home in German equities. Much of the market's rise this year was because of purchases by cash-rich foreign institutions, especially US institutions, eager to correct their underweight position in the German market. Now, as the Bund market enters a consolidation phase, it may be that domestic investors will provide further impetus. Taken together, these three factors have driven the market to a level where a great deal is being taken for granted. According to Kleinwort Benson, the DAX at its current level of 2,151.02 stands at a multiple of 26 times 1994 earnings. This is in spite of a 73 per cent increase in earnings in prospect next year, following a 47 per cent drop in 1993. The cautious investor, undoubtedly, would reach the conclusion that the market is overvalued at these levels - but undue caution at any stage in the past year would have been a recipe for missing out on large share price rises. Has anything changed now? Mr Andrew Thomson at Kleinwort Benson identifies a number of significant risks which - at some stage towards the end of the first quarter of next year - may bring the market's euphoria to an end. Politics cannot be ruled out as a destabilising factor. There are at least 20 regional, national and European elections scheduled for next year in Germany. As Kleinwort notes, there are a number of smaller, regional elections in March and April which - as in Brandenburg earlier this month - may trigger protest votes from disillusioned voters. Financial markets are likely to be upset by a surge in support for far-right parties or a deepening of the uncertainty surrounding the future of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's coalition government. Another potential problem is that the impact of corporate rationalisation turns out to be less far-reaching than expected, exposing current valuations as excessively optimistic. A first indication of whether this is the case will emerge two or three months into next year when Germany's big industrial groups report their final figures for 1993. This danger will be exacerbated if the economy recovers more quickly than expected: rationalisation is difficult to implement where the interests of the workforce come ahead of those of shareholders. It is only the severity of the current downturn that has forced management to attack costs and, if pressure relents, it is likely that relations between management and labour will revert to the comfortable pre-recession status quo that worked to the disadvantage of shareholders. In the words of Mr Tom Holmes at SMH, the message to shareholders in Deutschland AG must be: 'Hang on tight, keep your eyes closed - and your ears open.'</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105>Armenian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The European Parliament adopted a joint decision on  10 February in which it expressed its unease over the continuing  conflict between the Armenians and Azerbaijanis, which has  created an alarming situation in the region.    The text of the decision reads: Concerned about the danger  of the internationalization of the conflict, the European  Parliament advises the regional countries and governments and  all other powerful countries to refrain from providing any  military assistance to the conflicting sides.    Every country, especially Turkey, that neighbors Armenia and  Azerbaijan is called upon to allow free transport of freight  destined for both countries.    The European Parliament supports the presidency's statement,  which calls on the sides to show restraint and not to create new  suffering for the population, which has already suffered cruelly  because of the war.    It reaffirms its adherence to the principle of the  territorial integrity of Azerbaijan and calls on all the  involved sides to resolve the conflict peacefully by respecting  the UN Security Council resolutions.    Commenting on the European Parliament decision, the Armenian  Foreign Ministry Press and Public Relations Service expressed  concern that the document finds the European Parliament  continuing to tell the international public that the years of  conflict between Azerbaijan and Nagorno-Karabakh are a conflict  between Armenia and Azerbaijan. Identifying the sides directly  involved and those dragged into the conflict would help them to  understand the real essence of the conflict and the more  goal-oriented [word indistinct] of the peace process.</p>

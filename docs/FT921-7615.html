			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / International Company News: Mayne Nickless hit by poor trading conditions MAYNE Nickless, the Australian transport, security and medical group, yesterday blamed difficult trading conditions for a disappointing 0.7 per cent increase in equity accounted net profits to ADollars 52m (USDollars 40m) for the six months to end-December. However, profits increased to ADollars 108m after taking account of an abnormal gain on the disposal in September of the group's 11.8 per cent holding in Amcor, an Australian packaging manufacturer. Sales revenue fell 2.2 per cent to ADollars 1.4bn, largely reflecting the Amcor sale, but was 9.4 per cent higher on a consolidated basis. Mayne said the result was 'a creditable outcome in a continuing recessionary environment where trading conditions have been tight in many of the company's major markets.' Mayne also announced a one-for-five rights issue to raise ADollars 322m. The directors said that the capital injection would strengthen the company's balance sheet and enable it to expand its core activities 'as opportunities arise.' Mayne is a big investor in the Optus Communications consortium which has been awarded a licence to operate Australia's second telecommunications network. The company has also bought several small transport businesses in Europe over the past year, and is believed to be seeking further acquisitions to expand its express freight network. In addition, its healthcare division has built a substantial private hospital business in recent years through the acquisition of a number of healthcare businesses, including Hospital Corporation of Australia and the Sacred Heart hospital in Melbourne. Mayne said the outlook was bright for its transport and security businesses in Europe and North America. European profits increased by 195 per cent during the six months, due to an improved performance by Parceline, the group's UK express freight carrier. North American profits fell by 11 per cent, primarily because of a strike which affected the operations of the group's Loomis Courier express freight carrier in eastern Canada. Mayne said its healthcare, security and logistics management businesses were expected to perform strongly in the second half, but the contribution from express freight activities was likely to remain flat until the economy emerges from recession. The directors declared an unchanged interim dividend of 17.5 cents, fully franked. The group's shares closed 6 cents lower on the Australian Stock Exchange at ADollars 7.88.</p>

			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / Italy simplifies its lines of communication: A look at the emergence of Telecom Italia Telephone 'stew' was how the chief executive of Telecom Italia, Italy's newly formed telecommunications operator, yesterday described the country's old telecoms sector: a ragout of quoted companies, government departments and conflicting interests. Many users - who as recently as 1989 had to wait about three months for the installation of a new line, and pay more for calls than most of Europe - have less palatable nicknames for the old system. However, according to Mr Francesco Chirichigno, Telecom Italia's chief executive, the sector is entering a new era - simpler, more economical and more competitive - following the merger of five operating companies to form the new group. As of today, Italians are the owners of the sixth largest telecoms operator in the world (behind NTT of Japan, AT&amp;T of the US, and the German, French and UK national operators), with a combined turnover of some L27,000bn (Pounds 11bn), a net profit of L1,025bn, 101,000 employees and more than 25m clients. Shares that closed in Milan last night as Sip - the old domestic operator - open this morning as Telecom Italia. Shares in the international operator Italcable - the only other quoted subsidiary - have been delisted, with investors compensated in Telecom Italia stock according to a complex share-swap and capital increase agreed in May. Telecom Italia is still controlled by Stet, which is also quoted and is in turn controlled by IRI, Italy's state holding company. All or part of Iri's 65 per cent stake in Stet should be sold off, probably next year. Stet likes to call itself an industrial holding company, with other interests such as telecoms software, equipment manufacture and multimedia. Analysts are generally impressed by the manoeuvre which culminates in today's stock market launch of Telecom Italia. 'It tidies up what was a very untidy situation,' says Mr John Clarke, telecoms analyst at Daiwa in London. 'You now have effectively three entities, instead of about six.' In fact, much work has already been done by Sip to improve its service over the past five years. The three-month waiting list has been cut to 10 days in certain cities, for example. The merger will lead to further cost cuts, although management is are reluctant to quantify how many of the 100,000 or so jobs might be lost. Meanwhile, investors and users hope the establishment of an independent regulator for the Italian telecoms sector will provide clarity and predictability. Last week, Italy's anti-trust authority warned that without such a body, and the parallel liberalisation of infrastructure and access to networks, 'the competitive development of markets could be compromised'. That said, Italy seems unlikely to open its ordinary domestic network to full competition until required to do so by EU rules - in 1998 or later. For investors, the main uncertainty is likely to be the timing of Stet's privatisation and the promised demerger of Telecom Italia's cellular telephone business, one of the few areas of business to face domestic competition. The recent appointment of Mr Michele Tedeschi, former chief executive of Stet, as chairman of Iri seemed to raise hopes for an early privatisation of the telecoms holding company. Last week, however, the Italian industry minister indicated that Stet was more likely to come to the market in 1995. Prolonged indecision would be bad for Stet and Telecom Italia, although a delay as part of a clear timetable for privatisation would not necessarily displease investors. It would give the companies time to engineer the keenly awaited spin-off of Telecom Italia's mobile telephone business before the end of the year, giving Telecom Italia shareholders (including Stet) a stake in a third quoted Italian telecoms company. Today's transition is more of a landmark than an earthquake. Analysts estimate that historic earnings per share of Telecom Italia are 20 per cent higher than those of Sip alone, but the name-change is unlikely to affect the share price, which already takes into account the restructuring. And ordinary users will not experience any sudden improvements in service. Indeed for customers, the only immediate change is that by substituting Telecom Italia for the monosyllabic Sip, it takes six times as long to curse the Italian telephone system.</p>

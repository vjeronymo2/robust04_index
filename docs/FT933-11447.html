			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Courtaulds joint venture with Allied Colloids COURTAULDS, the internat-ional chemical materials company, has formed a 50-50 joint venture with Allied Colloids, the speciality chemicals company, to produce Oasis, a new super-absorbent fibre. A Pounds 8.4m plant will be built on the Courtaulds Fibres site at Grimsby. The new company will employ about 25 people and production is expected to start in late 1994. Initial annual capacity is targeted at 1,000 tons. As demand grows, capacity can be doubled at an estimated addition of Pounds 2m, according to Mr Peter Flesher, managing director of Allied Colloids. Chemically similar to the polyacrylate powders currently used for their super-absorbent properties, Oasis is designed for use in disposable personal hygiene products, wrappings for optical and power cables and speciality non-woven products ranging from construction to horticultural and medical applications. The move was seen as in line with the growing trend to diversify risks and spread the costs of research and development in the industry.</p>

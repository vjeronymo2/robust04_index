			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / Berlusconi urged to let trust manage his Fininvest empire Proposals for Italy's prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi, to step back from his Fininvest business empire won cautious approval yesterday from his coalition ally, the populist Northern League, but met with a cool response from opposition leaders. Mr Umberto Bossi, the League's leader, said that the proposals by a commission of three jurists were 'a step forward'. The report, which was handed over to the Senate at the weekend by Mr Berlusconi, has suggested that he either sell Fininvest, Italy's second largest private group, or appoint a trust to manage it in order to avoid a conflict of interest. Mr Berlusconi, who commissioned the report on taking office in May, had been sitting on it for 11 days and has so far refused to comment. The Senate will today begin discussing the proposals, which are not binding. Mr Bossi, sounding a note of scepticism, said the plan represented 'an Italian type of 'blind trust' where very little is actually blind'. The opposition Party of the Democratic Left (PDS), the former Communist party, criticised it as being too little, too late. Mr Cesare Slavi, the PDS spokesman in the Senate, welcomed the fact that the report accepted a conflict of interest existed. But he said the contents were too vague and lacked teeth, especially over sanctions. The report avoids any mention of the need to reveal the full nature of ownership of a business. Mr Berlusconi's ownership of Fininvest is obscured behind 22 holding companies and two fiduciaries (trusts). The jurists suggest that any member of government must within 40 days of taking office make a full statement of business interests. If a person holds interests of L50bn (Pounds 20.4m) or more, he must sell them or hand over their administration to a trustee on a fiduciary basis. The report rules out enforced divestiture as unconstitutional. Mr Berlusconi has consistently refused to contemplate a forced sale. All non-media interests would be assessed by the existing anti-trust authority which would retain monitoring powers over any conflict of interest arising in the case of assets being managed by a trustee. Media interests - a specific reference to Mr Berlusconi's three commercial TV channels - would be monitored by the media watchdog commission. The Senate discussion will take place against the backdrop of two conflicts of interest. The first concerns Mr Berlusconi's battle with the Milan magistrature over its investigations into Fininvest. Last week, the cabinet sent a complaint to President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro over the behaviour of Mr Francesco Saverio Borrelli, the Milan public prosecutor. The second concerns the government's takeover of management and editorial control of Rai, the state broadcasting organisation, which is a direct competitor to Mr Berlusconi's TV channels.</p>

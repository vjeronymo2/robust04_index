			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / Krupp Stahl poised to close two big steel plants KRUPP STAHL, one of the best known names in the German steel industry, is set to shut down its entire output of some steel products, with the loss of 4,000 jobs in the heart of the Ruhr industrial region. Two of its plants face closure. The announcement came as thousands of steelworkers demonstrated in steel towns against imminent job losses throughout the industry and as Mr Gunter Rexrodt, economics minister, held crisis talks with steel industry leaders to agree a common strategy for next week's meeting of EC industry ministers in Brussels. That meeting is meant to decide on a Community-wide plan to reduce steel capacity. The talks showed clear differences between Mr Rexrodt and the industry on how far imports of cheap steel from eastern Europe should be restricted to protect the west European industry during the restructuring process. Krupp Stahl said that only last minute developments in talks with rival steel producers, including Thyssen and Saarstahl, could prevent a final decision to close its steel plants in Siegen and Hagen being taken at the end of March. 'We are standing on the brink of closure there if there are no new developments in the very near future,' Mr Gerhard Cromme, chairman of the Fried. Krupp group and the newly merged Hoesch-Krupp combination, told demonstrating steelworkers outside the Hoesch Stahl headquarters in Dortmund, where an emergency board meeting was also under way. Krupp Stahl, which provides almost half the turnover of the Fried. Krupp group, said the management had concluded the only solution to the latest steel market downturn was to give up its manufacture of steel sections such as pipes and girders, which totalled almost 550,000 tonnes in 1991. The company produces 3.6m tonnes of flat steel products, which would not be affected. The parent group has said it will decide whether to close an integrated steel plant belonging to Hoesch Stahl in either Dortmund or Duisburg-Rheinhausen in the next two weeks, as the company seeks a drastic cut in its steel-making capacity. The company said last night the decision would be taken as soon as the production and sales figures for February were known. The Krupp statement said final calculations on the viability of its output of steel sections - all of which are high quality, special steels - had not been made. It was possible that some residual activities could be kept going during the closure process. The co-operation talks with Thyssen and Saarstahl might also offer some relief. It is estimated the restructuring may cost 30,000 steel jobs in west Germany and another 10,000 in the east.</p>

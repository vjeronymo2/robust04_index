			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Catalyst hint Precious metal refiner Johnson Matthey tumbled late in the session on reports that Allied-Signal, the US chemical company, had developed a palladium-based automobile exhaust catalyst that replaces the use of platinum. The story has been around before but nevertheless sent shares in the world's leading platinum refiner into retreat, falling 19 to 459p at the day's worst. Analysts, however, remained sceptical and one said: 'This story has been around before and the falls then were short-lived and this could be the same.' The company also said there was nothing new in the story, and with the market coming to the view that there was unlikely to be a serious effect on profits derived from platinum, the shares rallied just ahead of the market close to finish 16 down at 462p after thin volume.</p>

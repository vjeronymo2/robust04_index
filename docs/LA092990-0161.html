			<p><P> September 29, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Newspaper Guild Authorizes Strike: A union representing about 1,200 San  Francisco newspaper workers unanimously authorized a strike if contract talks  fail to forge an agreement soon. "We've been bargaining since last February,  and our members are increasingly upset that no contract has been reached yet,"  said Bernie Beck of the Northern California Newspaper Guild's unit at the San  Francisco Chronicle. No deadline for completion of contract talks had been set.  </P></p>

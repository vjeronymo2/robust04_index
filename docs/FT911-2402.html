			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / Talks open on future of Northern Ireland MR Peter Brooke, Nor-thern Ireland secretary, opens talks on the political future of the province today, with all parties pledging to do their utmost to reach an historic agreement. Speaking in Belfast yesterday, Mr Brooke said he had been impressed by the way all sides were approaching the dialogue. He said: 'It is a good thing for constitutional politicians and the two governments to have agreed a basis to sit down and talk. But I hope we can . . .use the opportunity to make successful agreements on a wide range of issues.' Today he will open bilateral talks with Northern Ireland's main constitutional party leaders, starting with the nationalist Social Democratic Labour party and moving on to the moderate Alliance party this afternoon. The four constitutional parties involved have been preparing their position papers for the talks, which start with the internal government of the province. Dublin will join in the talks when they broaden to cover relations between Ulster and the Irish republic, and between London and Dublin. Today's meetings are expected to concentrate on the agendas for plenary sessions due to get under way next week.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Knesset Member [MK] Ari'el Sharon says that the  Likud needs a new leadership, and that an alternative -- of  which he intends to be a member -- must be created for the  failed opposition.    Interviewed by Qol Yisra'el, Sharon said the struggle was  being spearheaded by the Council of Jewish Settlements in  Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza rather than by the Likud, which has  failed miserably. Sharon said the Likud should get a new  leadership, capable of waging a democratic and legal struggle in  the face of danger.    Reacting to Sharon's remarks, MK Me'ir Shitrit said that  most  Likud voters apparently want peace, and that is why so few of  them take part in anti-peace demonstrations. He called on  Sharon to appear before the Likud Central Committee and try to  muster 75 percent required for the election of a new leadership.  Shitrit said he will not lend a hand to the ouster of Binyamin  Netanyahu, who would be called upon to quit the leadership only  if he fails in the elections. MK Shitrit proposed to Netanyahu  to consolidate a leadership of five or six people, including  Ari'el Sharon, to make the Likud leadership's work more  effective.</p>

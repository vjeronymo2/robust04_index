			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / Trafalgar takes further charges Trafalgar House yesterday announced further restructuring costs for its troubled engineering division, only seven months after it revealed Pounds 397.3m of exceptional charges - described by analysts as a 'kitchen sink exercise'. The engineering, shipping and property group said the latest charges, amounting to 'not less than Pounds 15m', were being made to ensure that the engineering division could operate profitably at reduced levels of business. Trafalgar shares fell 4p to 78p yesterday, their low point for the year, as analysts marked down earnings forecasts by close to one third. Forecasts were also cut after disappointing interim results on May 26. Brokers are now suggesting pre-tax profits of around Pounds 35m for the year to September, compared with a consensus forecast of Pounds 80m at the start of the year. Most of the restructuring costs will cover job losses among the engineering division's 22,000 workers. A Trafalgar official indicated that the latest redundancies were likely to be in the 'hundreds'. In addition, the company is planning to merge some of its European operations. Trafalgar announced at the time of its interim results that the engineering division remained weak due to problems in Europe and a downturn in North Sea oper-ations. The figures revealed that operating profit margins from engineering had fallen from 2.8 per cent to 1.2 per cent, and Mr Simon Keswick, chairman, said at the time that 'further downsizing' would be necessary. In the latest letter to shareholders Mr Keswick said that conditions had 'if anything, become more difficult since then'. Mr Andrew Mitchell, analyst at Smith New Court, said: 'Longer-term, the cost base will be improved, but this underlines the fact that it is going to be a long haul for Trafalgar to achieve a full recovery.' The company also gave details yesterday of the latest acquisition by its cruise line subsidiary Cunard. Cunard is paying Dollars 170m (Pounds 113m) for the Royal Viking Sun, but this figure could increase if profits exceed Dollars 35m year in either or both of the two years commencing July 1. The maximum amount payable is Dollars 5m.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Gerald Papy: "Not Spontaneous"] </F>   [Text] On Sunday [2 January], Louis Tobback, Belgian  interior minister, agreed to share his thoughts with us  following the violent events of the previous day. He largely  refutes the idea that the Turkish reaction to the meeting of the  Kurds in Saint-Josse was spontaneous.  <H5>  Other Events Have Passed Without Incident </H5>   The minister stressed that the demonstration by the Union of  Patriotic Intellectuals of Kurdistan, who arrived from Bonn, had  been authorized by the German and Belgian authorities. The  march through Liege and an overnight stay in Hasselt -- both  towns with a high concentration of Turks -- passed without  incident.    The visit to Saint-Josse -- the militants were to occupy the  Flemish cultural center in the rue de la Commune for four days  -- should not have been any more cause for tension, believes  Louis Tobback.    Did not the proximity of a large Turkish community in the  area suggest possible problems? The interior minister does not  think so, arguing that larger pro-Kurdish events have already  been organized in other areas of the capital where many Turks  live and they went off without incident.  <H5>  What Good Would Banning Do? </H5>   Is the unfurling of the Kurdish flag enough to explain the  sudden eruption of violence by the Turks? The interior minister  does not believe so; he does not accept that the street  demonstration was a spontaneous event and suggests another  analysis. "To my knowledge, the incidents were not provoked by  the Kurds," explains the minister. "The clashes were not  spontaneous. On the basis of the report by the gendarmery, I  note that the Turkish demonstrators included many members of the  far right organization known as the `Grey Wolves.' This was not  by chance."    The interior minister goes further and does not exclude the  possibility that the clashes were provoked in Brussels in order  to induce the government to ban the activities of the PKK  [Workers Party of Kurdistan] and its satellite organizations, as  Germany and -- to a lesser degree -- France decided to do at the  end of November and the beginning of December 1993. Could this  outcome be envisaged in Belgium? Louis Tobback is very  skeptical. "First of all, our constitution provides no legal  basis to allow us to ban a political party. Secondly, what good  would it do? It is not by banning the PKK that you will cause  it to disappear. But if we can bring to light the offenses  committed by its militants, we will then take the necessary  sanctions against them."</p>

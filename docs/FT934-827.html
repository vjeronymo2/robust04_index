			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / Survey of Saudi Arabia (1): Life for the not so rich - The long-awaited consultative council is an important step in developing a method of tuning into public opinion. Meanwhile, the kingdom is trying to come to terms with its budget deficit at a time of pressure on oil prices Saudi Arabia was briefly a rich country. In one spectacular year - 1981 - it earned more than Dollars 120bn from oil exports, ran a budget surplus of about Dollars 35bn and enjoyed net foreign assets of close to Dollars 170bn. Its per capita gross national product was Dollars 12,600, one of the world's highest. Today it is ranked by the World Bank as a middle-income country with a per capita GNP of about Dollars 6,750, larger than Greece but less than half that of Singapore. It has run a persistent budget deficit for the past decade, which last year reached about 9 per cent of GDP, double that of the US. Its current account deficit in 1992 was close to Dollars 20bn, about half of its estimated oil earnings for the year. Athough this trend has been clear for some time, the message seems to be only slowly filtering through to the majority of Saudi Arabians and the outside world. Individual Saudis may still rank among the world's richest; however, the nation does not. Symbols of affluence abound, but the government needs urgently to find new ways of raising revenue and cutting expenditure. Saudi Arabia will remain an attractive market for foreign companies, yet for some, especially defence contractors, disappointments are likely to lie ahead. These are issues which many other governments would happily address, provided that they also had Saudi Arabia's proven capacity to continue pumping oil at its current rate of 8m barrels a day for the next 100 years. But that asset, unique in the world, also appears to be the biggest obstacle delaying the Saudi ruling family and its government from confronting the country's worsening financial problems. President Saddam Hussein bears part of the blame. The Iraqi leader's invasion of Kuwait in 1990 did not just threaten the survival of the House of Saud, it also cost the country some Dollars 55bn-Dollars 60bn which would have helped to cushion the effects of a temporary fall in the price of crude oil. The jubilation which greeted the partial defeat of the Iraqi regime was deemed by the Saudi government to be hardly the moment for publicising the need for relative austerity, while the military establishment's demands for more and better weaponry could not easily be ignored. The Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, King Fahd bin Abdulaziz, and his ministers, appear still to be hoping that something will turn up - in effect, the price of oil - to lessen the need for hard choices. Instead, oil prices have this month hit a five-year low and the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries appears to be at a loss to explain or reverse the trend. Saudi Arabia has already been forced to concede some market share, but gives no indication that it is willing to drop its production below 8m. b/d. Worse still, the spectre of Iraq resuming oil sales at some point in the future - although it is unlikely to occur within the next 12 months - looms heavily over the market, and with it the possibility that oil prices will be driven substantially lower. Much though Saudi Arabia would like to see the back of the Iraqi regime, the survival of President Saddam Hussein and the maintenance of international sanctions are greatly in the interest of the nation's exchequer and those of its Opec partners. However, the Iraqi regime will eventually change and it will resume oil exports with the vigour expected from a country which over the past decade has suffered ever-worsening deprivation. Even without Iraqi sales and assuming the absence of currently unforeseen boosts to world demand for oil, Saudi revenues will do well to remain in the Dollars 40bn-Dollars 45bn range for the next three to four years. They could, of course, fall significantly below those levels. Earlier this year a team from the International Monetary Fund concluded that 'the medium-term outlook is for growing budgetary and external current account deficits because current expenditure growth, even if modest, is not expected to be matched by an increase in oil receipts. Such developments would be unsustainable and could cause damage to the economy.' In IMF language, that is a serious health warning. However, judged by the standards of most of the industrialised world, the Saudi patient should not be in need of much preparation before facing up to what is scarcely major surgery. Saudi Arabia has in the past three decades undergone an extraordinary revolution without showing any serious signs of social upheaval or widespread political dissent. The strength of family and tribal ties, and external disciplines of religion, have allowed Saudis to cope with a fundamental physical transformation of their country, the distorting effects of sudden wealth, wars on its borders, a huge influx of expatriates, the temporary presence of foreign armies, intense international scrutiny and no little envy. The nation has survived remarkably intact. But, clearly, the government believes that its generous subsidies and virtually tax-free environment has also played a key part in assuring social cohesion. Officials told the IMF team a few months ago that 'political and social considerations precluded a reduction in subsidies or an increase in fees and charges'. While that is only partly correct, because a start has already been made to reduce the hugely wasteful subsidies on excessive wheat production, plenty of economists in the kingdom are ready with lists of relatively painless revenue raising measures. There would also be no lack of advice available if the government decided that it had to make a more serious effort to reduce its planned expenditure. This could range from rationalising recurrent government spending, a review or delay in some the Dollars 30bn of new defence contracts entered into since the end of the Gulf war, and a fresh look at the huge list of planned and actual infrastructure projects estimated to cost further tens of billions of dollars. The effort will also have to be sustained over a period of years. Even without the current fall in the price of oil, the demographic pressures building within the kingdom are intensifying the demand for budget allocations. Official figures, greeted with a degree of public scepticism, suggest that the population of the kingdom is now close to 17m, including 12.3m Saudis. Latest estimates indicate that the Saudi population is growing by at least 3.5 per cent a year, and it could be higher. The effect is already being seen in the demand for increased health care, education, water supply, power generation and housing. It is possible that many of these issues could be handed to the newly-created Majlis al-Shura, a milestone structure in Saudi Arabia's largely featureless political landscape. The 60-member majlis, or consultative council, has been chosen by King Fahd to advise him and the council of ministers on issues referred to it. No-one is required to act on any of the council's recommendations, but it would seem a pointless exercise by the king to have spent so much time on personnel selection only to ignore the deliberations of his chosen men. It might also seem sound royal politics to create an additional layer of quasi-government, albeit consultative, which could be subsequently blamed for suggesting measures which aroused popular opposition. To the surprise of many foreign diplomats in Riyadh, the consultative council was weighted heavily in favour of professional men, more than half of whom have higher degrees from western universities, with only modest representation from the more traditional, conservative stratas of Saudi society. All are, however, characterised by what one member described as 'our deep commitment to king and country'. The enthusiasm with which they are approaching their responsibilities suggests at least a novel opportunity for debate, and an acceptance by the royal family that governing an increasingly complex and much less affluent nation requires more involvement of the public. But from the outside, it still appears to be a very modest adjustment to what is already a fundamentally changed economic environment.</p>

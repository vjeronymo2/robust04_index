			<p>BFN     [Text] Seven Armscor [Armaments Corporation of South  Africa] employees were sent by government to the United States  to give evidence in a case in which it is alleged that American  firms and individuals contravened the ban on exporting weapons  to South Africa and Iraq. The questioning of the seven men  about their involvement will begin today. The government had  previously refused to release the men for questioning since it  was feared that sensitive information on South Africa's atomic  and missile secrets would be exposed. Observers believe there  is a strong possibility these men will supply the secret  information in exchange for a new identity and residence in the  United States. An offer by Armscor for these men to be  indemnified and for the payment of their fines was rejected last  month by American prosecutors. The men are extremely  dissatisfied with the government's and Armscor's inability to  arrange indemnity for them.</p>

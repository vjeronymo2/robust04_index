			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: France samples home-grown petrol - An unusual use for sugar and cereal products PUT a sugar beet in your tank. Nigel Mansell did, with good effect. The British racing driver won last year's Portuguese grand prix in a Williams-Renault car running on a mixture of ordinary petrol and a biocarburant known as ETBE produced in France. Such 'green petrol' is now becoming increasingly available to ordinary French motorists and the opinion polls show that they are more than happy to use it. Since April Elf-Aquitaine's Feyzin refinery near Lyons has been producing ETBE, or ethyl-tertio-butyl-ether. The product is a mixture of ethanol, made from sugar beet or cereals, and isobutane, an industrial product. With a capacity to make 75,000 tonnes a year, the Feyzin refinery can produce enough ETBE to put 5 per cent of the biocarburant in all the company's unleaded petrol. To begin with Elf just added ETBE to the petrol it sold in the Rhone-Alpes region around Feyzin, with no publicity. But emboldened by positive soundings from opinion polls the oil company is now openly marketing its ETBE mix of petrol, from specially marked pumps, in the departments of Seine-et-Marne and Essonne to the south of Paris. A form of green diesel is also coming on to the French market. It contains a methylester made from rape seed oil, which is added to standard diesel fuel. It was developed in the early 1980s by a company called Sofiproteol, under the trade mark name of Diester, to which Elf bought the exclusive distribution rights. There are now several producers of the generic product, rape oil methylester, but so far it has only been sold to 'captive fleets'. Shell France, for instance, announced this month that it would be supplying the 354-bus fleet of Caen in Normandy with diesel composed of one-third rape oil methylester. However, with the commercial advantage of the Diester brand name, Elf now plans to market it more widely. Developing green oil is an old dream for farm-rich but energy-poor France. But the idea has been driven forward by last year's reform of the European Community's Common Agricultural Policy, particularly with its requirement that all but the smallest farmers must take 15 per cent of their land out of food production. In theory such a move could render 1.3m hectares idle in France. But, according to Mr Jean-Pierre Le Roudier, who runs the Association for the Development of Agricultural Carburants, 1m hectares of that land could produce enough to put 5 per cent of ETBE in petrol and 5 per cent of rape oil methylester in diesel - and in the process minimise farmers' loss of income. The French government has done its bit. Since last year biocarburants have been exempt from the standard petrol and diesel tax, and that has at last made the green fuels competitive. In February a government-commissioned report by Mr Raymond Levy, former president of Renault, came out broadly in favour of continued public support for biocarburants, although he drew complaints from sugar beet producers (whose products go into ethanol, the base for petrol additives) that he was biased in favour of the rape oil additives for diesel. But cost is crucial, says Mr Alain Guillon, Elf's head of refining and marketing. 'We are ready to go on producing Diester, provided it is competitive with diesel, and to use ethanol for ETBE, provided it is competitive with methanol.' Elf started importing methanol in 1986 to produce MTBE (methyl-tertio-butyl-ether) to give petrol back the octane rating that it loses from the elimination of lead. But three years ago the company started tests to see what it could do if it replaced the imported methanol with home-grown ethanol. One thing it decided not to do was to inject pure ethanol into petrol, as had been done widely in the US. Mr Jean-Paul Lemonde, the Feyzin refinery director, explains that the main problem with pure ethanol is that it is soluble in water and therefore more prone to contaminate and be contaminated. ETBE does not have that disadvantage. Mr Pierre Varriot, head of Feyzin's steamcracker unit, admits that 'isobutane is a bit harder to mix with ethanol than methanol but we have proved industrially that ETBE works'. Elf 'wanted to be ready with all the technical solutions, when the farmers asked for help last year', Mr Guillon says. The oil company does big business with France's 1m-strong farming community, which it did not want to jeopardise. But he cautions that growing biocarburants is by no means a total solution to French farmers' problems. That caution was echoed in the Levy report which calculated that putting 5 per cent of biocarburants in all French fuels would only create 8,000 to 10,000 new jobs, half of them outside farming. Furthermore, Mr Guillon warns that 'all our strategy is reversible. If, for instance, the tax exemption were to disappear, then we would go back to importing methanol as a petrol additive and we would forget about adding rape oil into diesel'. That is why French biocarburant producers are keen to see progress on the 1992 proposal by Mrs Christiane Scrivener, the EC tax commissioner, for a 90 per cent reduction in excise taxes on green fuels across the Community. Such a move would not only help any French exports but would also help lock the current French tax exemption in place. Belgium, whose own oil company, Petrofina, broadly favours biocarburant development, has promised to make the Scrivener proposal a priority of its EC presidency in the second half of this year. But EC tax proposals need unanimity to pass. Behind the reticence of several governments to the tax plan are environmentalists who argue that biocarburants pollute as much as fossil fuels, though in different form, and oil companies like British Petroleum and Esso, who claim that aiding natural ethanol will hurt the market for sythetic ethanols.</p>

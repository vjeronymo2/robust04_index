			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Where and How `Dirty' Money Is </F> Laundered"]    [Text]     -  One-third of the currency sold last year in the  Moscow Currency Exchange was acquired with funds stolen  beforehand in false remittances.    -  The damage from crimes in the field of banking is far  worse than the overall damage from all other crimes involving  money.    -  More than half the banks in Moscow are not making use of  the approporiate means to provide for their own security.    -  Russia is becoming an international center for money  laundering.    <H8>    * * * </H8>   Crime in the banking system is continuing to get worse. Some  indicators of the activity of subunits in the struggle against  economic crimes, which I will cite below, attest to this.    While internal affairs organs exposed 617 crimes associated  with the theft of money by misappropriation or abuse of one's  official position and 76 cases of bribery in 1992, they recorded  4,258 crimes, including 2,076 cases of theft---1,337 of which  were theft on a large or very large scale--and 164 cases of  bribery in 1993.    As shown by experience in exposing cases of bribery in the  banking system, apart from consultation and technical  assistance, the role of banking employees who took bribes most  often involved the acceptance of fictitious payment documents.    Criminal associations which have penetrated the banking and  entrepreneurial business have skillfully taken advantage of the  banking system's failure to adapt to the conditions of a market  economy and the inadequacy of interbank settlements, putting  hundreds of billions of rubles into circulation with fictitious  payment documents in the 1991-1993 period.    In 1993 alone, about 70 operations investigation groups came  to the main administration from various regions in Russia to  work on criminal cases involving use of the banking system for  the theft of money. We have analyzed and singled out a number of  factors which make it possible to carry out the shady  transactions on such a large scale.    One of the most important factors is the poor supervision of  commercial banks by the NTsB [National Central Bureau [of  Russian Interpol]]. Evidence has been acquired in specific  criminal cases that in a number of instances, the persons who  organized the actions to enter funds with fraudulent documents  were bank employees, and sometimes even the managers of those  banks which were experiencing a "credit shortfall" and had a  huge debit balance.    A special role in the financial machinations belonged and  continues to belong to the numerous structures in the market  economy established by and registered to fictitious individuals,  utilizing fictitious documents. In most cases, substantial  amounts of money have been stolen and "laundered" under the  cover of fictitious enterprises.    The GUEP [Main Administration to Combat Economic Crime], in  interaction with the GUVD [Internal Affairs Main Administration]  of the city of Moscow, has exposed a criminal group of 25  persons which opened more than 30 current accounts for more than  3 billion rubles in Moscow commercial banks, using fictitious  registration documents and false passports. It turned out that  the funds in enterprises' current accounts were used primarily  to obtain foreign exchange.    According to our information, no less than one-third of the  2.63 billion U.S. dollars sold in the Moscow Currency Exchange  in 1992 and the first quarter of last year were acquired with  funds stolen beforehand in false remittances. Later the  criminals concluded contracts with foreign firms for the  delivery of commodities which did not come to Russia, as a rule.  This is how currency is being drained to other countries. The  plan is very simple, but there is no mechanism to provide a  reliable deterrent to deliberate criminals or laws which provide  for specific physical persons to be held responsible.    Analysis of available materials on foreign economic activity  shows that numerous organizations and enterprises which make  advance payments to pay for imports are not submitting documents  in the established procedure to authorized banks to confirm that  commodities are entering Russian territory. Many of them say the  reason for nondelivery of goods is the unfairness of the  importers, but according to our information, these foreign  economic transactions are often fictitious in nature.    The Law "On Currency Regulation and Currency Control in the  Russian Federation" stipulates the responsibility for conducting  currency operations in violation of the established procedure  and for failure to submit the appropriate documents to currency  control organs. But in our view, the criminal laws in force  should also stipulate the responsibility for concealing currency  income received from foreign economic activity or understating  its amount and failing to observe the established requirements  for it to be legally brought into and taken out of the country.

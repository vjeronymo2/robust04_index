			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / Selling of Glaxo drug to be probed THE French government yesterday ordered an independent inquiry into the ethical, legal and medical acceptability of the methods used by Glaxo, the UK pharmaceuticals group, to promote one of its newest drugs in France. The social affairs ministry has appointed two senior law and medical professors to report within two months on Glaxo's promotion of Imigran, a migraine treatment. It will decide in the light of the findings whether to ask the European Commission to investigate possible abuse of a dominant market position, officials said. Imigran was approved in Britain and the Netherlands last autumn, but has not yet received clearance from the French government, which also sets prices - through negotiation with producers - for drugs reimbursed by social security. French officials suspect Glaxo of arranging heavy press coverage of Imigran's virtues to whip up demand from patients before the government has carried out full checks. Officials argue that migraine is hard to diagnose objectively and that doctors could come under unnecessary patient pressure to prescribe what is a costly treatment. Imigran costs about Pounds 10 for each pill and about Pounds 20 for every injection. One US analyst estimates its sales could reach Dollars 10bn (Pounds 5.6bn) a year by the end of the decade. Glaxo claims there is no alternative effective treatment for migraine. Imigran is one of three new Glaxo products described by analysts as potential blockbusters. The company needs substantial revenue from Imigran, and two other drugs, Zofran, a treatment to curb nausea in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy, and sales of the ulcer treatment drug Zantac, the world's best-selling pharmaceutical. Analysts point out that pharmaceuticals companies selling in Europe have been unable to increase prices of existing products in line with inflation. They have compensated by introducing new products at high prices. Gross margins of patented pharmaceuticals are normally higher than 90 per cent. They say Glaxo is also keen to charge a high price for the drug in France, a country with traditionally low pharmaceuticals prices, to help avoid parallel exports from France to other EC countries. Glaxo said last night its French company had not re-ceived a direct communication from the French government. The company said it was confident that the French company had 'acted properly and in a way consistent with the highest standards of our industry'. This is the second European government to show concern over Glaxo's commercial strategy. Denmark asked Brussels at the end of February to examine whether the UK company was abusing its position by charging too much for Imigran, Serevent and Zofran. 'If allegations over marketing hype as well as Glaxo's pricing went to the European Commission, this would certainly cause serious problems,' said Mr Robin Gilbert, pharmaceuticals analyst at James Capel, the London stockbrokers. He added that the total cost of treating French migraine sufferers could be more than the Pounds 1.2bn estimated for the UK. This would undermine both Glaxo's strategy of charging high prices for innovative drugs and its policy of giving new products heavy advance publicity.</p>

			<p>941024 FT  24 OCT 94 / Leading Article: A grip on the Commission This week Mr Jacques Santer faces the first big test of his leadership and deal-making skills since he was named as next president of the European Commission last summer. He has called a meeting of fellow commissioners on Saturday to settle the distribution of portfolios for the five-year term that begins in January. Baronial battles between commissioners with a particularly high esteem for their own abilities are in predictably full swing. Completing the process this week matters less than getting these appointments right. The European Union faces a complex and contentious agenda, and the Commission has a vital role to play both in managing the changes now under way and in brokering the difficult trade-offs between member states likely to be necessary in the coming years. It needs to focus clearly on the weightiest tasks by placing them in the most capable hands. As important, Mr Santer - nobody's first choice for the job - needs to establish his own authority over the political agenda and over the Commission's internal workings. In both spheres the need for action is urgent. The Commission in the dying months of Mr Jacques Delors's 10-year presidency presents a sorry spectacle: dogged by poor morale and petty in-fighting, its dealings with the member states hampered by mutual mistrust and legal disputes. In a whole range of policy areas - from state aids to industry through enforcement of agricultural reform to EU policy towards the Balkans - there is a damaging impression of drift. It is for Mr Santer to seize the initiative. Substantial consensus In one sense conditions are propitious for him to do so, for the current bickering between member states disguises the fact that there is a substantial consensus about two broad things the new Commission should be doing. First, it should focus not on elaborating Delors-style grand visions or fighting turf wars with the Council but on using its substantial treaty powers to make the existing Union work. That means an enhanced effort to smooth out irregularities in the internal market, to ensure free and fair competition and to improve industrial competitiveness. It also means being realistic about what can be achieved at the 1996 Inter-Governmental Conference on institutional reform - an event which if mishandled could easily sidetrack the Union into acrimonious and futile constitutional wrangling. Mr Santer should take particular care with the internal market portfolio, in which, regrettably, none of the Commission's heavyweights has thus far expressed interest. The lack of an aggressive Commission push on the single market has been the biggest disappointment of the past two years, and urgently needs redressing as the EU admits up to four more members and its core member states gear up for the third phase of monetary union. In no other area is there a bigger risk of the EU's losing credibility with its citizens or businesses. Strategic priorities Second, the Commission - already unwieldy with 17 members and about to become still more so with the addition of four more - should develop a clearer sense of strategic priorities than it has displayed of late, especially with regard to external relations. Mr Santer is right to judge that Mr Delors's division of external relations between a political portfolio (held by Mr Hans Van den Broek) and an economic one (Sir Leon Brittan) has not worked. He is also correct to want to take overall charge of external relations himself by chairing a Commission sub-group on the subject - not least because the most important issue in external policy, relations with central and eastern Europe, will have a profound influence on the Union itself in coming years. Mr Santer's first task early next year will be to draw up a white paper on preparing the central and eastern Europeans for eventual EU membership. That will involve the entire Commission, not just the two men who are currently squabbling over the eastern Europe portfolio. And if it is wise, it will focus equal scrutiny on what the applicant countries need to do to prepare and on how the Union needs to adapt to admit them. That would be the most practical route-map to take the Union towards the millennium.</p>

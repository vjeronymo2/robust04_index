			<p><P> September 5, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ROLEX ROBBERY SUSPECTS SEIZED AFTER CHASE  </P> <P> A man suspected of snatching a Rolex watch off the wrist of another man in  Beverly Hills on Tuesday afternoon was arrested along with an alleged  accomplice after a five-mile car chase, authorities said.  </P> <P> The robbery occurred in the 100 block of South Swall Drive after the victim  left a car dealership on nearby Wilshire Boulevard, said Beverly Hills Police  Lt. Robert Curtis.  </P> <P> As the man prepared to drive off, Curtis said, one of the suspects reached into  the vehicle and began wrenching the pricey President model Rolex from the man's  arm.  </P> <P> Residents who saw the ensuing struggle called police, then chased the suspect  as he escaped in a waiting vehicle, Curtis said. Police eventually pulled over  the car and the suspects -- identified by Curtis as Rex Carlton Thomas, 23, and  Gary Hayashi, 25, both of Los Angeles -- gave up. They were to be booked on  suspicion of robbery and other charges, Curtis said. The stolen watch and a gun  were recovered, he said.  </P></p>

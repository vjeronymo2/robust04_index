			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / Austrians likely to support entry Austria's voters look set to vote narrowly in support of joining the European Union in a referendum tomorrow. The latest Gallup opinion poll on Thursday indicated that 57 per cent of Austrians favoured membership, against only 28 per cent who would probably cast 'No' ballots. Earlier polls showed the two sides evenly balanced, with many voters undecided. Austrians are known for making up their minds about voting only at the last minute. Investors have apparently accepted the message of the Gallup poll, buying shares heavily on the Vienna Borse in the past three days. In the previous six sessions, the ATX index of leading shares lost 5 per cent of its value as fears of a rejection of the EU spread. The campaign ended yesterday on the shrill tone that dominated debate in the closing days. A story that Austrians would have to buy Spanish-made yoghurt containing a harmful bacterial colouring agent was put about by right-wing leader Mr Jorg Haider. And the conservative Austrian People's party staged a rousing 60th birthday party at Vienna's Hofburg Palace for Mr Alois Mock, the popular foreign minister, who has fought passionately for the EU cause. Mr Mock has won immense sympathy for his tireless campaigning in spite of a debilitating nervous system disease. The referendum result will be known early tomorrow evening.</p>

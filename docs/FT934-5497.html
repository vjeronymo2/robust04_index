			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / World Trade News: 'Bio-piracy' under new fire - Frances Williams on concern at Gatt patents draft The proposed Uruguay Round accord to strengthen worldwide protection of intellectual property, virtually unchallenged since it was drafted two years ago, has resurfaced as a focus of discontent. In a belated and almost certainly doomed effort to change the terms of the accord before the global trade talks are due to end on December 15, representatives from groups as diverse as Guaymi Indians in Panama, Indian farmers and Latin American drugs manufacturers have been trooping through Geneva to air their grievances. Last week the pharmaceutical industries of Canada, Egypt, India and 13 Latin American countries issued a chilling warning on the consequences of obligatory protection of pharmaceutical patents. This, they claim, will reinforce monopoly rights of the leading drugs multinationals, raise domestic drugs prices by as much as 1,000 per cent, increase the costs of essential health care and put much of their indigenous pharmaceutical industries out of business. In the past, industries in these countries have been able to copy patent medicines, often without paying royalties, which has enabled them to produce drugs cheaply for home consumption and undercut patent-holders in export markets. The new rules would stop unauthorised copying by placing strict limits on government powers to license production of a patented drug without the patent holder's consent. This would be possible on payment of an 'adequate' royalty only if a company refused to authorise use of the patent 'on reasonable commercial terms and conditions'. Gatt officials concede that industries in countries obliged to introduce pharmaceutical patent protection for the first time will have their long-term prospects dimmed. However, in the short term production of existing drugs will not be affected. Nor will production of most new drugs coming on the market in the next 10 years or so because they stem from inventions already made and patented and now going through the lengthy process of testing and authorisation. A bid by Washington to secure 'pipeline' protection for pharmaceuticals, which would have involved retroactive recognition of patents, was firmly rejected by other nations. US negotiators, though not yet the US industry, appear to have abandoned the struggle. Gatt officials also point out that the alternative to a Gatt accord would not be the status quo but increased bilateral pressure from the US, which has already secured better terms for its pharmaceutical industry from several developing countries under threat of trade reprisals. 'On the whole, governments think this agreement is as good as they will get and they don't want to re-open it for fear of something worse,' says a senior trade official. The other main contentious and even more emotive issue - 'patents on life' - is less easily disposed of. The draft accord specifically allows countries to exclude animal and plant inventions (and bio-technological processes for their production). But many environmental and third world development groups argue that it should outlaw patents on life-forms altogether on the grounds that it sanctions 'bio-piracy' or the expropriation of poor-country resources by rich-country drug multinationals. Indian farmers have demonstrated in their hundreds of thousands against the patenting of plant varieties, which they fear will threaten traditional breeding of seed hybrids and the sale or exchange of seeds among farmers. Though plants as such are excluded, the Gatt accord will require new plant varieties to be protected by patents or other means. Even more concern has been expressed over the patenting of human genetic material, highlighted recently when a Canadian-based third world development group uncovered a patent claim by the US secretary of commerce on a Guaymi Indian cell line. The blood sample from which it was derived was taken from a 26-year-old Guaymi Indian woman while she was being treated for leukaemia in a Panama hospital. It is now held by the American Type Culture Collection, in Rockville, Maryland, where it can be drawn on for genetic research. The Guaymi woman's cell line is of special interest to researchers because some Guaymi people, the largest indigenous group in Panama, carry a unique virus and its antibodies which may prove useful in Aids and leukaemia research. The draft Gatt intellectual property agreement contains some safeguards against exploitation, but not much. Apart from the permitted exclusion from patenting of plants and animals, it requires patented items to be the product of an invention, not a discovery of something occurring naturally. The Guaymi patent application did not deal with an invention 'but rather the discovery of an antibody which is part of the blood of the Guaymi woman,' Mr Isidro Acosta, president of the Guaymi General Congress, wrote to Mr Ron Brown, US commerce secretary, last month. However, such objections can be circumvented by quite minor modifications or by the patenting of techniques to stabilise genetic material or extract it from its source. The Gatt accord provides for a review of the 'patents on life' provisions four years after coming into force (probably some time in 1995). The battle lines are already being drawn between Washington, which wants greater international patent protection for life forms, and a growing body of opinion keen to see better safeguards and fairer sharing between rich and poor of the benefits of gene-related research.</p>

			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / Ciller means business on state asset sales: Turkey's PM has staked a lot on privatisation THE success or failure of Mrs Tansu Ciller's promise to drive down inflation and stabilise the Turkish economy hinges in large part on the prime minister's radical privatisation plans. With her True Path party (DYP) facing a leadership congress next month and with nationwide municipal elections in March, she is badly in need of some quick results. Little has happened since privatisation was first set in motion in the mid-1980s, when minority stakes were sold in several state enterprises. Mrs Ciller's government wants to speed up the sale of the large state corporations and to sell majority holdings. Strong economic growth, and a decisive political lead on the issue, is raising hopes that Turkey may now be about to address the problems of a state sector that comprises some 240 companies and absorbs about 30 per cent of Turkey's fixed capital investment. Mrs Ciller, an academic economist who entered parliament in 1991, is staking her political reputation on scaling back the state sector. This, she believes, is the only way to curb Turkey's 70 per cent inflation, the issue on which the next election is certain to be fought. The relaunch of the privatisation programme reflects mounting budget worries, but also concern that Turkey could lose out if a spate of asset sales across Europe soaks up international investor demand. Mrs Ciller has still to convince her coalition partners, the Social Democratic Populists (SHP), some of whom still appear attached to the statist economic principles on which their party was founded. But as long as her public support continues, her advisers believe privatisation could acquire an unstoppable momentum, if she can just pull off one or two big sales in the next few months. The broad objective is to reduce the burden on the budget, free up government resources, promote new efficiences in the economy and give a leg-up to the capital markets. Turkey is pursuing a twin track strategy: the immediate sale of some of the better state concerns such as telecommunications and the petrol sector, and the introduction of the legal and social infrastructure necessary for disposing of big loss-makers such as the Zonguldak coal mining corporation. After relying largely on homegrown advice, Ankara is turning to foreign expertise. The World Bank, which sent a privatisation team to Turkey in August, is considering financial assistance for the creation of a social safety net, without which the large job losses associated with privatisation would be politically difficult. Mrs Ciller has warned of closures and redundancies. But given the current growth rate - gross national product rose by 12 per cent in the second quarter compared with the same period last year - Turkey should be able to absorb the job losses. Not everything is going her way, however. She faces union opposition because of feared unemployment and resistance from the industrial ministries for whom continued control over state companies is an important lever of patronage. Her opponents already claim one scalp. Special decree powers granted to government in June and which have been used to bypass parliament on key economic legislation, have been overruled by the constitutional court. The ruling is not itself retroactive, and therefore should not affect the decree splitting up the PTT postal and telecommunications monopoly to allow the more profitable telecoms arm to be sold. However it could slow reform. In addition to telecommunications, the state assets on offer include oil refining and distribution, steel, and trade and banking operations. Many of the companies are considered eminently saleable. The Eregli works on the Black Sea must be one of the few steel operations in Europe reporting increased profits. The telecoms enterprise is making healthy profits, and is described by an industry observer as 'one of the best prospects of any privatised telecoms company in Europe'. Mrs Ciller has also split off the banking arms of both Etibank, the minerals conglomerate, and Sumerbank, the retail and textile giant. The liabilities of Sumerbank's 46 banking branches have been taken over by the state-owned Halk Bank; shares in its retail outlets are being distributed to employees. The appointment of foreign consultants underlines the urgency being given to the programme. Lehman Brothers of the US and J Henry Schroder Wagg of the UK, in partnership with two local banks, are selling the government stake in Tofas, the local Fiat car assembler, in what would be the biggest ever international offering by a Turkish company. Separately, talks are continuing to appoint advisers on the two principal privatisations - that of the PTT, and of the Tupras oil refinery, which is to be sold together with Petrol Ofisi, the retail and distribution operations. The planned sale of 20 per cent of the telephone monopoly is expected to realise close to Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.3bn). For the petroleum sector, offers have been submitted from eight bank groups, including Samuel Montagu, Chase Manhattan, and Kleinwort Benson. Brokers say the government is looking at the sale of two refineries and the PO retail outlets. However, officials say there is unlikely to be much interest in a portfolio holding unless the buyer has control over brands and assets. Ultimately, with other countries also unveiling privatisation plans, it is not just Turkey's disgruntled politicians Mrs Ciller has to convince. She must also assure foreign banks that this time Turkey means business on privatisation.</p>

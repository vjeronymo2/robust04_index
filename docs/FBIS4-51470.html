			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 27 May (XINHUA)--The person-in-charge of  the Ministry of Justice pointed out today that a U.S. Embassy  official in China has confirmed that a 21 May report by the  ASSOCIATED PRESS [AP] alleging that China "is still exporting  prison products" is totally groundless.    Pursuant to the relevant provisions of the "Memorandum of  understanding between Chinese and U.S. Governments on banning  the import and export of prison products," the Chinese Ministry  of Justice allowed and arranged for two officials from the U.S.  Embassy in China to visit Zhejiang Province No 4 Prison and  other such units between 19th and 21st May. During the visit,  prison officers answered U.S. officials' questions and provided  them with information. The visit failed to uncover evidence of  any violations of the "Memorandum." But AP reporter John  Leicester, after interviews with the concerned U.S. embassy  officials in China, claimed in his report that "U.S. consular  officials in China were informed that these reform institutions  are still exporting prison products to the United States."    Concerned Justice Ministry departments made inquiries at the  U.S. Embassy in China about this matter. Lorraine Toly, a U.S.  embassy official, stated that AP's report was mistaken and had  distorted what she had said in the interview. She said this  was what she had told the AP reporter: "If the U.S. Customs is  tipped off that a certain Chinese prison is exporting its  products to the United States, they will contact, together with  Chinese authorities, this prison to request an inspection." "In  this reporter's dispatch, my interpretation became `Toly says  that U.S. officials have been informed that these reform  institutions are still exporting prison products to the United  States.'" This U.S. embassy official said that she was  "annoyed" by the AP report, and added "I will telephone AP to  make a complaint." This embassy official has written to the  Chinese Justice departments concerned, apologizing for any  possible confusion created by the report.    The person-in-charge of the Ministry of Justice reiterated  that the Chinese Government has always been conscientious,  responsible, and efficient in implementing the "Memorandum of  Understanding Between Chinese and U.S. Governments on Banning  the Import and Export of Prison Products." He pointed out that  the letter by the U.S. official showed that the 21 May report by  AP is a complete distortion of the facts.</p>

			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / International Company News: Government demands hold up Swissair SWISSAIR said yesterday a co-operation agreement linking it with KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) and Austrian Airlines could not be signed until September at the earliest, writes Ian Rodger in Zurich. The four were hoping to agree terms by the end of this month. In the longer term, a full merger is envisioned. Swissair insisted the delay did not reflect any disagreement or disaffection among the partners. Rather, there were issues taking longer to resolve than expected. An important one was satisfying the demand of the Swiss federal government that Swissair put forward alternative plans to ensure its independence. The government holds a 7 per cent stake in the national airline. Swissair, which has made clear its frustration with the government's order, said it would probably be unable to prepare documentation and fix a meeting with federal officials until after the summer holidays. Meanwhile, Swissair's supervisory board, on which a senior federal government official sits, said following a meeting this week it agreed with the airline's management that it would be increasingly difficult to 'go it alone'.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Ku Ying (7357 4481): "The CPC Earnestly Hopes </F> for Economic Cooperation With Britain"]    [Text]  <H5>  Tian Jiyun "Clears Up the Mess" Left by Lu Ping </H5>   The visit to Hong Kong by Lu Ping, director of the Hong Kong  and Macao Affairs Office, excited one sensation after another.    The visit to Hong Kong by another CPC big shot, however, was  exceptionally played down and most Hong Kong people did not even  know of his arrival.    The big shot is Tian Jiyun, member of the CPC Central  Committee Political Bureau and vice chairman of the National  People's Congress [NPC]. He made a two-day stopover in Hong  Kong on his way home from a visit to foreign countries in  mid-May. But his stay in Hong Kong was kept strictly  confidential.    It was reported that Tian came to Hong Kong to take a rest.  But anyone with a discerning eye knew that under the political  situation in which "the Chinese side and the British Hong Kong  Government are irreconcilably hostile to each other," "to take a  rest" was a lame excuse.    In reality, Tian, who was travel-worn and weary, did not  take  a good rest in Hong Kong. Instead, he met with Hong Kong NPC  and Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference deputies,  Preliminary Working Committee for the Preparatory Committee of  the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region [PWC] members, and  certain local businessmen--naturally those well-known tycoons he  could trust.    Clearly Tian was entrusted with the task of "putting a  certain message across to local people." It appeared that the  CPC leaders, who were dissatisfied with the results of Lu Ping's  visit to Hong Kong, "which failed to achieve what it had been  designed to achieve," were eager to send Tian to Hong Kong to  offer some clarification on certain matters.  The Proposal To Reclaim Hong Kong Ahead of Schedule Had Been  Supported by the  <H5>  Majority of Party, Government, and Military </H5> Leaders    At the meeting, Tian answered every question. He aired his  "personal views" on many questions put to him in a great effort  to reassure local people.    Tian answered some sensitive questions concerning the latter  half of the transitional period.    Question: Will China reclaim Hong Kong ahead of time?    Tian: When Britain changed its policy toward China in the  fall of last year [as published] and had its own way in Hong  Kong, many people on the mainland favored recovering sovereignty  over Hong Kong before the due date. There was a strong demand  for this in the party, in the NPC Standing Committee, and in the  military. Some Hong Kong industrialists also went to Beijing to  ask the central authorities to take decisive measures because  they feared Hong Kong would get out of control and be plunged  into confusion. Our comrades in the party and the government  were also divided on whether the principle of "one country, two  systems" could be put into effect. The central authorities  finally decided that though the Chinese side had failed to  obtain cooperation from the British side on Hong Kong's  constitutional reform, it would try its best to achieve  cooperation with the latter in other fields with a view to  reducing the possible shocks and chaos in the transitional  period to a certain extent while stepping up all necessary  preparations against sudden incidents.  <H5>  Tian Predicts That Hong Kong Will Possibly Experience a Shock </H5>   Question: Will there be turbulence in the latter half of the  transitional period?    Tian: In my view, in the transitional period, some people  will create confusion and disturbance by taking advantage of the  setting up of the PWC, the formation of the Special  Administrative Government [SAR] Government, the transfer of  political power to China by the Hong Kong colonialist  government, the appointment of secretarial-level officials by  the SAR Government, the abolition of laws and regulations  contradicting the Basic Law, and the banning of some extremist  organizations in accordance with the Basic Law. The central  department concerned has studied all these possibilities. The  central authorities have since 1990 made preparations against a  big economic shock or even economic collapse. The mainland has  injected more capital into Hong Kong than any other foreign  country and has made substantial commitments to certain friendly  countries and conglomerates. So if there is no great  disturbance on the mainland, there will be no sustained economic  shock or collapse in Hong Kong. However, social unrest and an  economic shock may be unavoidable. We cannot pin any hope on  the British authorities.  <H5>  "Hong Kong Will Be Worthless Without Stability" </H5>   Question: Will China really carry out the principle of "one  country, two systems" after 1997?    Tian: The central government has pursued a consistent  policy toward Hong Kong. No mainland system will be applied in  Hong Kong and no attempts to turn Hong Kong into a city where  all political forces wrestle with each other are allowed.  Otherwise who will invest in Hong Kong? At the same time, we  will prevent Hong Kong from evolving into a welfare society.  Hong Kong is a small place short of natural resources, so an  economic recession or a severe economic slump could easily  occur. Hong Kong's value lies in its stable social environment,  and it will be utterly worthless without stability.  <H5>  "Local People Will Be Allowed To Hurl Abuse at the CPC After </H5> 1997"    Question: Will press freedom be guaranteed after 1997?    Tian: After the founding of the SAR Government 1 July 1997,  people will still be allowed to hurl abuse at the CPC and the  press to publish articles criticizing mainland policies and  systems. A sound political party enjoying popular support is  immune to invective. Over the last few years, some people have  cursed the CPC every day, criticizing everything. They even  cooperated with Britons in cursing us. Mainland people reacted  strongly to this abuse, but we persuaded them not to fight back.  Naturally, no organized subversive, inflammatory, or hostile  activities are allowed.    Question: Will Shanghai take over Hong Kong's role by the  end of this century or by 2005?    Tian: Shanghai has grown rather rapidly due to favorable  conditions. Shanghai is trying to rank among other big  international cities in terms of defense and high-tech  industries, finance, transportation, and trade. However, Hong  Kong has its own characteristics and strong points, so it will  not be replaced.  <H5>  The CPC Has Taken Action on Many Occasions To Shatter Hong </H5> Kong People's Vulnerable Confidence    According to the businessmen who met with Tian, in contrast  to those fierce officials responsible for Hong Kong affairs,  Tian was undoubtedly much more amiable. Though what he said was  cliches, he was sincere and did not dodge sensitive questions.  The businessmen present appreciated his frankness and  sincerity. As compared with Lu Ping, who made Hong Kong people  feel ill at ease on his last visit, Tian certainly acted in a  timely way to reassure local people. Tian said: The CPC is  trying to cooperate with Britain in fields other than the  political one. Does this imply that the CPC will carry out a  tough political policy while adopting a "flexible economic  policy"? This remark by Tian merits attention.    However, there is a serious problem: The CPC has made  sincere and solemn promises over the last 10 years, but it has  taken action to kill Hong Kong people's weak and vulnerable  confidence on various occasions. The principle of "one country,  two system" and the promise "to keep Hong Kong's capitalist  system unchanged for 50 years" have become terms which people  ridicule. China, big country as it is, has actually failed to  capture Hong Kong people's confidence. Such a distorted  situation brought about by the rule of man is unfortunate for  the CPC as well as for Hong Kong people.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] President Denktas has said that the Turkish Cypriot  side agreed to negotiate the issue of the Lefkosa [Nicosia]  Airport and the opening of Maras [Varosha] -- part of the  confidence-building measures -- based on the reports drawn up by  the UN secretary general and the experts.    In a statement to the press today, Denktas pointed out that  the confidence-building measures are being based on the premise  that they will bring great economic advantages to the Turkish  Cypriot side. The UN secretary general and the experts have  confirmed this, Denktas said, adding: Our people will see. If  that is so, then naturally the negotiations will be held in a  comfortable atmosphere.    Denktas said that the reactions of the Greek Cypriot side  must be well assessed. The principles of the Turkish Cypriot  side are out in the open and we are not moving back, he said,  adding: However, we are not going to shun negotiations to be  held with goodwill.    Denktas recalled that in a speech in Thessaloniki, Greek  Cypriot leader Kliridhis said he wants everything and every  place and that he will not allow the Turkish Cypriot side any  atvantage. On the other hand, Denktas stressed, we are being  strongly reassured that the Turkish Cypriots can take their  passports and fly from Lefkosa International Airport.    Denktas pointed out that another point on which the Turkish  Cypriots are being strongly reassured is the fact that the Ercan  [Tymbou] Airport control area and Ercan airspace will not be  affected, and that Ercan will continue to function as it does  today. The president said that planes registered in Turkey will  be able to land and take off from Lefkosa Airport without  intervention. He explained that this would mean an extensive  relaxation of the embargo imposed on the Turkish Cypriot side.    Denktas went on to say that the entry into the Lefkosa  International Airport will be from two separate gates, and that  the gate from the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus [TRNC]  will be solely in the hands of the TRNC authorities. He added:  The FIR [Flight Information Region] line between us and Turkey  which concerns our security will surely not be affected and will  continue as it is today.    Denktas pointed out that the Greek Cypriot side said earlier  that it would participate in the negotiations for tactical  reasons only. It is necessary, he stressed, not to underestimate  the difficulties, to remain cool, and to be patient.    Denktas said: It has been explained that the  confidence-building measures were drawn up not in order to  deceive the two sides, but to lead to new cooperation and to  grant extensive economic advantages -- in the words of the UN  secretary general -- to the Turkish Cypriot side which has been  the subject of an embargo for years. At the end of the  negotiations, we will see whether these promises were true or  not, and we will ask our people for their opinion.    The president pointed out that the secretary general's  special envoy Joe Clark will meet with him and Kliridhis on  Monday, and that the shuttle diplomacy between the two sides  might begin at the end of February. If positive results are  achieved, Denktas said, it may be necessary to go to New York.    Replying to a question, the president said that he might be  going to Turkey during the first week of February.</p>

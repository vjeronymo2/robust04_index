			<p><P> February 23, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> FORMER SWISS OFFICIAL CLEARED OF VIOLATING SECRECY POLICIES  </P> <P> The nation's highest court today cleared former Justice Minister Elisabeth Kopp  of violating official secrecy, a charge that ended her chances for the  presidency.  </P> <P> The five-judge panel of the Federal Criminal Court ruled that Kopp had not  violated official secrecy laws when she made a telephone call warning her  husband to quit a company suspected of laundering drug profits.  </P> <P> The court said it could not be proved that she revealed secret information  deliberately.  </P> <P> A guilty verdict would have made Kopp Switzerland's first government minister  disgraced by a criminal conviction.  </P> <P> Kopp, 53, was forced to resign from the government in the unprecedented case  that cost her a chance to be Switzerland's first woman president.  </P> <P> Kopp telephoned her husband Hans on Oct. 27, 1988, to tell him to resign as  vice chairman of Shakarchi Trading Co., a Zurich-based foreign exchange and  gold-trading firm about to be linked to a "Lebanon Connection" money-laundering  probe.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Explanation of Provisions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> In General  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The final regulations would simplify the computation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> depreciation by allowing taxpayers an election to group  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assets into one or more general asset accounts under section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 168(i)(4). The assets in any particular general asset  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> account are depreciated as a single asset. Unlike the rules  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under section 168 as in existence before enactment of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Tax Reform Act of 1986, general asset account treatment is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not limited to ``mass assets.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As required by section 168(i)(4), the final regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide generally that the amount realized upon the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disposition of an asset from a general asset account is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recognized as ordinary income. In addition, special rules  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are provided for terminating general asset account treatment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> upon certain dispositions. For transactions described in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 168(i)(7)(B), the transferee generally is bound by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the transferor's general asset account election.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Changes to the Proposed Regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This Treasury decision generally adopts the rules in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the proposed regulations. Certain changes to the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations have been made, however, in response to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comments. These changes and the comments that were not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adopted in the final regulations are discussed below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Assets Subject to Recapture <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . One commentator  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recommended that the proposed regulations be amended to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allow general asset account treatment for assets qualifying  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the credit under section 47 or 48. After considering  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this comment, the IRS and Treasury Department have concluded  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that it is appropriate to allow taxpayers greater  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> flexibility in determining what assets will be included in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> general asset account. Therefore, the proposed rule that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prohibits general asset account treatment for investment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> credit property has been deleted. Accordingly, under the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> final regulations, a general asset account may include any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> depreciable asset for which a credit or deduction is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allowable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A new rule, however, has been added in the final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations to account for any basis increase upon  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recapture. The final regulations provide that upon  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recapture, the asset is removed from the general asset  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> account as of the first day of the taxable year in which the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recapture event occurs. In addition, corresponding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adjustments to the unadjusted depreciable basis and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> depreciation reserve of the account must be made. This rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was formulated in view of the limited types of property  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> currently eligible for the investment credit. The IRS,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> however, may consider other alternatives to take into  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> account the basis increase upon recapture if the scope of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> property that qualifies for the investment credit is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expanded.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Assets Used in a Personal Activity. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations retain the rule of the proposed regulations that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a general asset account may not include an asset if a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> taxpayer uses the asset both in a trade or business (or for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the production of income) and in a personal activity at any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> time during the taxable year in which the asset is first  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> placed in service by the taxpayer. Consistent with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> retention of this rule in the final regulations, a new rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has been added providing that an asset in a general asset  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> account becomes ineligible for general asset account  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treatment if a taxpayer uses the asset in a personal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> activity in a taxable year after the taxable year the asset  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is placed in service. If this change in use occurs, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> final regulations provide that the taxpayer must use the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> method provided in &sect;1.168(i)-1(e)(3)(iii)(C) for adjusting a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> general asset account when an asset becomes ineligible for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> general asset account treatment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Assets that Generate Foreign Source Income. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commentator suggested that the proposed regulations be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amended to allow general asset account treatment for assets  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> generating foreign source income.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response to this comment, the final regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allow general asset account treatment for assets generating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> foreign source income. If, however, the inclusion of these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assets in a general asset account results in a substantial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distortion of income, the Commissioner may disregard the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> general asset account election and make reallocations of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> income or expense as necessary to clearly reflect income.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Investment gain helps Pru to Pounds 249m - Losses from general insurance sharply reduced to Pounds 14m REDUCED general insurance losses and a bumper realised investment gain, boosted the half-year result at Prudential Corporation, the insurance and financial services group. Pre-tax profits of Pounds 249m represented a 46 per cent increase on the Pounds 170m achieved in the same period last year and were only Pounds 18m short of the 1991 full-year profits. Earnings per share advanced from 5.4p to 9.6p and the interim dividend is increased to 4.1p (3.8p) Overall losses from general insurance business fell from Pounds 54m to Pounds 14m, reflecting premium increases and cost reductions. In March the group announced that it was withdrawing from commercial insurance business generated by brokers. Mr Mick Newmarch, chief executive, said staff numbers at Pru's broker division had been cut from 1,150 to 450. Profits from realised investment gains amounted to Pounds 52m (Pounds 1m). Mr Michael Lawrence, finance director, said a substantial chunk of the gain was due to a decision to sell UK and US equities - many of which had been acquired many years ago - and buy D-Mark bonds with the proceeds. In addition the group had reduced its exposure to US and Canadian dollars by Pounds 200m. Overall profits from investment management operations, unit trusts and personal equity plans, investment income and investment gains rose to Pounds 64m (Pounds 34m). Profits from the core long-term life insurance business rose to Pounds 199m (Pounds 190m), although gross life premium income was static at Pounds 3.4bn. New annual premiums in the UK rose by 6 per cent to Pounds 172m, while single premiums increased 56 per cent to Pounds 1.06bn. UK life insurance profits amounted to Pounds 138m. The figure includes a provision for the potential impact of any reductions in bonus which might be necessary next March. Prudential reduced the bonus rates on its with-profit policies last March by 7 per cent (for ten-year policies) and 5 per cent (for 25-year policies). Mr Newmarch said that 'with interest rates falling it is reasonable to expect that bonuses will be reduced.' In the US, profits from Jackson National amounted to Dollars 44m (Pounds 22.1m). The fall of Dollars 4m was attributed to low interest rates and difficult market conditions. The main blackspot was a disappointing performance by Prudential's reinsurance subsidiary, Mercantile and General. Pre-tax losses by M&amp;G's general reinsurance business leaped from Pounds 2m to Pounds 25m. Life reinsurance profits of Pounds 32m (Pounds 24m) partially offset the deficit. COMMENT Even without the realised investment gain which boosted interim profits by Pounds 51m, the steady growth in pre-tax profits from life and general insurance operations indicate that the company is coming to grips with the problems that have undermined its performance in recent years. Following the sale in 1990 of its estate agencies and the withdrawal from broker generated commercial risks business in March this year, Prudential's main problem is the sluggish performance of its reinsurance subsidiary. Although claims from catastrophes could be a problem, the company is on course to produce profits of at least Pounds 450m in 1992, giving it ample scope to increase its dividend at a rate above the market average. On yesterday's closing price of 236p, and assuming the rate of dividend increase is sustained for the full year, the share is on a yield of 6.8. That is above the average for the sector and indicates that Prudential could begin to climb towards the ceiling of its current trading range.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "(ivh)": "Omnipol Is Trying To Sell Missiles"] </F>   [Text] Prague/Adamov--The Adast Adamov shareholding  company has 440 KONKURS antitank guided missiles intended for  sale in its warehouses. This information was given to a LIDOVE  NOVINY correspondent by Adast Director General Jan Dosek.    Adast acquired the weapons, worth 168 million korunas, as a  debt payment from the Slovak enterprise ZVS [General Engineering  Plants] Dubnica, which made the explosive and propulsion  elements of the casings for the missiles manufactured in Adamov.  Dubnica went into debt in 1992 when the Federal Army (as the  only customer) refused to take delivery of an order for 900  missiles. "Payment in missiles was the only way of getting the  debt from Dubnica," said Dosek. Adast Adamov has entrusted the  Prague-based Omnipol company with the deal. It deals in the  export of Czech weapons.    "So far, we have not managed to sell one KONKURS missile,"  said Jiri Sir, Omnipol's commercial director, to LIDOVE NOVINY.  According to him, these are weapons made under a Russian license  at a relatively high cost. Sir claims that comparable missiles,  the French MILAN missile and the U.S. TOW missile, are cheaper  than our missiles. He said that the weapons trade is going  through a recession, and, moreover, the market is flooded with  antitank missiles from the states of the former USSR.  "Supplying these defensive weapons to UNPROFOR [UN Protection  Force] units offers us some chance," added Sir. He ruled out  the possibility of a contract with any of the warring sides,  however. Equipping the KONKURS missiles with an adaptor for the  NATO weapon system and selling them to the Czech Army would be  an extreme solution.    S. Fritzl, deputy director of the special materials  department at the Trade and Industry Ministry Licensing  Administration, told LIDOVE NOVINY that Omnipol submitted two  applications last year for a license to export the KONKURS  missiles; however, his department turned them down. The reason  was that the international community considers the end-user  countries to be high-risk regions. The Licensing Administration  has not registered any applications this year to export antitank  missiles.</p>

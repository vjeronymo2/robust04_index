			<p>BFN     [Text] Brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih,  Presidential Council chairman, yesterday received a letter from  his brother, Colonel Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi, leader of the 1  September revolution in Libya. The letter deals with the  current developments in our country and Libya's firm, constant  position that strongly supports Yemeni unity and rejects  secession under whatever name, since Yemeni unity is a pan-Arab  gain and an advance step along the path to embody the pan-Arab  objective of comprehensive Arab unity.    The letter expressed the fraternal Libyan people's support  for their brothers in the Yemeni Republic and their backing  under the umbrella of unity and democracy. It also dealt with  issues of interest to both fraternal countries. The letter was  delivered by brother Sayfawi Yusuf, the charge d'affaires of the  Libyan Brotherhood Bureau in Sanaa who met with the president  yesterday.    The brother president praised the principled pan-Arab stand  of the brothers in Libya, led by brother Col. Mu'ammar  al-Qadhdhafi, who has devoted all of his life to the cause of  Arab unity and who played a key role in supporting all steps and  efforts that led to the Yemeni unity and the establishment of  the Yemeni Republic and supporting the march of unity since it  was launched on 22 May 1990.    The brother president asserted that Yemeni unity is here to  stay. It will be safeguarded by the Yemeni people and their  Armed Forces.</p>

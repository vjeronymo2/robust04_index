			<p>930504 FT  04 MAY 93 / Letter: Like a virgin Sir, You report that All Nippon Airways is to paint one of its Boeing 747 aircraft with the design of a whale (April 28). I find a certain gruesome irony in this idea, given the Japanese dedication to hunting this unfortunate creature to extinction. Perhaps British Airways should paint virgins on its aircraft.

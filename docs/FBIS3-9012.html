			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Csurka: We Are at Home!"] </F>   [Text] The reason people want Laszlo Csucs, deputy  chairman of Hungarian Television, to resign is to have another  excluded Hungarian. It makes no difference whether the  government is behind the events in the radio. However, if it is  not, then it should be ashamed of itself, Istvan Csurka,  cochairman of the Hungarian Justice and Life Party [MIEP], said  in his speech. According to estimates, at the MIEP's call some  4,000-6,000 people gathered at Szabadsag Square [in Budapest] on  15 March.    Csurka was welcomed with flags in national colors and Arpad  stripes ["arpadsavos," neo-Nazi symbol] and banners saying "We  want Hungarians in television and radio!" and "Cheers for  Csucs!" In his speech, he said that since 1848, the front has  been lying between Hungarianness and foreignness, and now,  "foreign mercenaries have reoccupied the public." According to  Csurka, the liars have preserved their positions and their goal  is to "spread the Marxist-Leninist system over the people." In  his view, international financial support is behind the  nation-destroying attitude. "We must not be afraid now: We are  the majority, we are at home, and we have greater love for the  homeland," Csurka said in conclusion.    The crowd cheered Csurka and Csucs for a long time, while  some people shouted unprintable abuse at two young people  wearing blue ribbons [symbolizing protest against radio  dismissals].</p>

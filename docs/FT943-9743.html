			<p>940809 FT  09 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Supply deficit in nickel likely The nickel market is this year heading for its first supply deficit since 1990, according to the research team at Billiton-Enthoven Metals, part of the Royal Dutch/Shell group. However, the deficit - forecast to be 8,000 tonnes - will be 'only a drop in the ocean given the sizeable surpluses (totalling 110,000 tonnes) accumulated in the last three years'. So nickel prices are likely to be slightly lower in the second half of 1994 despite continuing strong demand from the stainless steel industry, the principal user of nickel. Mr Angus MacMillan, Billiton's research manager, says nickel might ease back to Dollars 2.63 a lb (Dollars 5,800 a tonne) compared with last night's closing price of Dollars 2.76 a lb (Dollars 6,092.50 a tonne). The CRU International consultancy group recently reported that 30,000 tonnes of nickel was waiting to be shipped from the port of Dudinka in Russia and another 10,000 tonnes was at Murmansk. Mr MacMillan says that, when this metal arrives in the west, London Metal Exchange warehouse stocks will rise, putting downward pressure on prices.</p>

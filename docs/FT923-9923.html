			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / Olympic News In Brief: Christie through British sprinter Linford Christie left crack American Leroy Burrell and formerly banned Ben Johnson of Canada behind to go through to today's semi-final in the 100m. All three have been drawn together again in the semis. Christie, distressed that his friend and fellow sprinter Jason Livingston had been sent home after failing a drugs test, showed real single-mindedness. After coasting through his opening heat, Christie then equalled his season's best time of 10.07.</p>

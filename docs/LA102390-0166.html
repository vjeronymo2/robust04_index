			<p><P> October 23, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> GERMANY MAY BE TOP EXPORTER  </P> <P> The head of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade said today that Germany  is likely this year to again replace the United States as the world's biggest  exporting nation.  </P> <P> Top GATT official Arthur Dunkel said global economic strength depends on a free  trading system, and Germany therefore has special responsibilities in the  troubled Uruguay Round of trade liberalization talks.  </P> <P> The negotiations are scheduled to end Dec. 7 but are deadlocked over  agriculture, with Germany in particular resisting a European Community offer to  reduce huge farm export subsidies as the United States and other nations have  demanded.  </P> <P> Reforming agricultural trade is a "critical" part of the Uruguay Round but  "five weeks away from the end we are nowhere near this goal," Dunkel said.  </P> <P> He noted that Germany replaced the United States in 1986 as the world's biggest  exporting nation and held the position in 1987 and 1988, with the United States  moving back into the top spot in 1989.  </P></p>

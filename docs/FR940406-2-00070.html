This announcement is related to the priority area of Environmental Health. (For ordering a copy of ``Healthy People 2000,'' see the section  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> WHERE TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL INFORMATION <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Authority  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This program is authorized under sections 301(a) (42 U.S.C. 241(a)) and 317A (42 U.S.C. 247b&hyph;1) of the Public Health Service Act, as amended.

This is consistent with the PHS mission to protect and advance the physical and mental health of the American people.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Eligible Applicants  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Applications may be submitted by public and private, nonprofit and for-profit organizations and governments and their agencies. Thus, universities, colleges, research institutions, hospitals, other public and private organizations, State and local health departments or their bona fide agents, and small, minority and/or women-owned businesses are eligible for these cooperative agreements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Applications will be considered for funding to conduct studies in one or more programmatic interest areas. Applicants interested in conducting more than one study must submit a separate application for each. If a single study addresses more than one programmatic interest area, only one should be identified as the primary interest area. The programmatic interest area should be clearly indicated for each study.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Availability of Funds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Approximately $600,000 is available in FY 1994 to fund approximately three cooperative agreements. It is expected that the average award will be $200,000 (direct and indirect cost), ranging from $100,000 to $350,000. It is expected that the awards will begin on or about September 30, 1994. The awards will be made for 12-month budget periods within a project period up to 3 years. Funding estimates may vary and are subject to change based on the availability of funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Continuation awards within the project period will be made on the basis of satisfactory progress and the availability of funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Purpose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The purpose of these awards is to study important epidemiologic questions critical to the implementation, operation, and expansion of childhood lead poisoning prevention programs, and to support the development of guidelines and policies. These awards are to study:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Sources of lead exposure in children in high-risk communities or in the general population;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Sources of lead exposure in children in day care centers; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. The relationship between housing characteristics (that do not require environmental sampling) and the distribution of blood lead levels in children.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Program Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To fulfill the objectives of this cooperative agreement, an applicant must meet the following requirements:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1.

Demonstrated access to a laboratory with demonstrated proficiency in performing blood lead (and other laboratory measurements as indicated in the applicant's study protocol).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Demonstrated ability to ensure that children identified with elevated blood levels receive appropriate medical and environmental management through an ongoing childhood lead poisoning prevention program (which need not be applicant's organization).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Union Radio News" newscast] </F>   [Text] The Central Bank of Venezuela has announced it will  auction dollars starting on Wednesday to meet the high demand in  the foreign exchange market. According to a communique from the  bank, the measure is aimed at proportionately distributing among  agents the amount of dollars at a carefully calculated average  price.    The announcement also specifies that the amount of U.S.  currency requested by agents must not exceed 10 percent of the  amount sold the previous day. Banks and other operators may sell  this foreign currency to the public for a profit that must not  exceed the amount of 20 cents above the original purchase price.    Although the demand for dollars continued on Tuesday at a  frenetic pace, the comparative level of the foreign currency's  current price decreased. In fact, the dollar's price closed at  128.50 bolivares in the banks and at 129.50 in the foreign  exchange houses. Meanwhile, the Central Bank of Venezuela  continued to supply foreign currency to enable financial  organizations to meet public demand.    According to business groups, the increase in the dollar's  price will be reflected in product prices over the next few  months. According to the Jose Bouza Izquierdo, chairman of the  National Banking Council, citizens should not get nervous and  make purchases that encourage an increase in the dollar's  exchange rate, because the exchange market situation is  beginning to stabilize.</p>

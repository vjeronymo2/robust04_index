			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / Hosokawa to cut income tax to stimulate economy THE JAPANESE government yesterday confirmed that it plans to cut income tax early next year in an attempt to stimulate stubbornly poor domestic demand. Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the prime minister, said he would implement tax reform in line with yesterday's long expected proposals from a government tax panel, for a cut in income tax, to be funded by an increase in consumption tax. Japanese business groups and the US government agree that a cut in income tax is vital to help pull Japan out of recession. The changes are part of a wider overhaul of the tax system, designed to spread the tax burden more evenly and avoid a drop in government tax revenue as Japan's population ages. The panel left the precise size and timing to the government, but economists assume the income tax cut will be worth Y5,000bn (Pounds 31,446m). That should lift next year's growth by 0.6 per cent, Asahi Bank forecast yesterday. The main recommendations are: The top rate of income and residential taxes combined should be cut to 50 per cent from 65 per cent (of which 50 per cent is income tax and 15 per cent residential). Income tax on low incomes should also be reduced. Tax reform should not worsen Japan's tight fiscal position. Consumption tax should be raised from its current rate of 3 per cent. Food and other necessities should not be exempt. Inheritance taxes should be reviewed to ease burden on transfers of property and companies. Corporate taxation should be reduced. The panel will produce more a more detailed final report by the end of next month. Yesterday's proposals could increase divisions in the seven-party coalition just as it is basking in the triumph of having pushed political reform plans through the lower house of parliament. The Social Democratic party, the largest coalition member, opposes a rise in consumption tax on the grounds that this will hit the less well-off. Consumer groups made the same criticism. However, the Japan Renewal party, the second largest coalition member, follows the powerful finance ministry's line that income tax cuts must be funded by consumption tax rises, rather than by government bonds. Japan's social security budget will come under heavy demands from its ageing population over the next decade. By 2007, one in five Japanese will be aged 65 or more, making it one of the most aged populations in the industrialised world, up from 13 per cent now.</p>

So far the investigation has been in the hands of eight  investigators of the Sofia Investigative Service and the NIS  deputy chief who conducted all the necessary preliminary  investigative proceedings. The persons directly involved in the  incident, as well as senior police officers were interrogated.  The weapons seized, including the armament found near the scene  of the incident, were submitted for expert analysis, the press  release says. In the meantime some of the witnesses have  disclosed certain facts and circumstances which are being  investigated through the press. Such statements are unwelcome,  the NIS says in its release adding that it will make its  findings public when the criminal proceedings are completed.    As mass media reporters have been increasingly pressing  senior officials and employees of the Sofia Directorate of the  Interior for interviews in connection with the Belite Brezi  incident, the Directorate has got to warn them that its  employees will refrain from any public statements, the Sofia  Directorate of the Interior points out in a press release today.  It is stressed that the investigation and the disciplinary  proceedings launched have not been completed yet.</p>

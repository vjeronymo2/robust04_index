			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 45. Copyright Liability. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <FOOTCITE>19</FOOTCITE>  Under the 1992 Cable Act, a cable operator is generally not required to carry a station that would otherwise qualify for must-carry status if the station would be considered distant for copyright purposes, unless the station indemnifies the cable operator for its copyright liability. <FOOTCITE>20</FOOTCITE>  The Commission required cable operators to notify local commercial and noncommercial stations by May 3, 1993 that they may not be entitled to must-carry status because their carriage may cause an increased copyright liability. In the Report and Order, the Commission stated that it expected cable operators and broadcasters to cooperate with each other to ensure that operators are compensated for the cost of carriage of ``distant'' must-carry signals and that broadcast licensees pay only their fair share. <FOOTCITE>21</FOOTCITE>  The Commission stated that each licensee should be responsible for the increased copyright costs specifically associated with carriage of its station as a must-carry signal and that stations should be counted in the order they satisfy all the necessary conditions for attaining must-carry status. The Commission also determined that it would be reasonable for a cable operator to receive a written commitment for such payments from a broadcaster in return for an estimate of the broadcaster's expected copyright liability, based on previous payments and financial information. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 19 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> We note that the Satellite Home Viewer Act of 1994, P.L. 103&hyph;369, 108 Stat. 3477, which was signed into law on October 18, 1994, includes a provision to amend Section 111(f) of title 17, United States Code, specifically with reference to the definition of ``local service area of a primary transmitter'' by inserting after ``April 15, 1976,'' the following: ``or such station's television market as defined in &sect;76.55(e) of title 47, Code of Federal Regulations (as in effect on September 18, 1993), or any modifications to such television market made, on or after September 18, 1993, pursuant to &sect; 76.55(e) or &sect;76.59 of title 47 of the Code of Federal Regulations,''. We acknowledge that there may be some effect on pending petitions and on our current rules. We will revisit, to the extent necessary, those rules and policies which may be affected. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 20 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> However, a qualified local noncommercial station that has been carried continuously since March 29, 1990 is not required to reimburse a cable operator for its copyright liability to retain its must-carry status. In addition, a distant noncommercial station that has been imported prior to March 29, 1992, and which continues to be imported to meet the statutory requirements of Section 615, shall not be required to reimburse for copyright liability. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 21 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> We clarify that, in situations where copyright liability is incurred for carriage in some of the communities served by a single cable system, the broadcaster must indemnify the operator for that copyright liability for carriage in any community served by the system, unless the operator is able to provide different channel line-ups to the different communities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 46. On May 28, 1993, the Commission adopted a Clarification Order (``Clarification'') that, among other things, addressed certain copyright issues. We stated that we would require a cable operator to provide a broadcast station with a good faith estimate of the potential copyright liability for carriage of the station during the next copyright accounting period, as well as a copy of the most recent form filed with the Copyright Office for existing distant signal carriage that details the payments made for carriage of distant signals. The cable operator, however, is not required to make legal judgments pertaining to the amount of indemnity involved. In addition, a cable operator is required to provide such information within three business days of receipt of a written request from a broadcaster. <FOOTCITE>22</FOOTCITE>  Any cable operator not providing sufficient information to a broadcast station regarding potential copyright liability in the required timely fashion may be subject to Commission sanctions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 22 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> In its opposition, Time Warner argues that cable operators should be given at least seven days, not three, to respond to any requests for information regarding copyright liability. We reject Time Warner's proposal and note that in the Clarification we observed that the information that must be provided to broadcasters should be readily available to the cable operator. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 47. We concur with INTV and NAB that stations should be able to commit to copyright indemnification for periods shorter than the three years specified in the 1992 Cable Act. In light of the numerous factors that affect the liability payments, we believe that commitments can be for periods as short as one year (two six-month accounting periods). Otherwise, a station may be required to make a commitment that cannot be fulfilled, thereby leading to protracted litigation. However, in fairness to cable operators, we support NAB's proposal that broadcasters notify cable operators 60 days prior to termination of any agreements to indemnify them for copyright liability. In particular, this will provide sufficient time for cable operators to notify subscribers regarding the deletion of the station. <FOOTCITE>23</FOOTCITE>  Further, we disagree with NCTA that to permit agreements for periods of less than three years essentially allows stations to revert to retransmission consent. A station electing must-carry status remains a must-carry station for the entire three-year period, but, in situations where the station is considered distant for copyright purposes, a cable operator is not obligated to honor that election unless it receives a commitment for copyright reimbursement. Further, we note that where a station does not initially meet the criteria for must-carry status, it subsequently may assert its rights once it satisfies the conditions for must-carry status. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 23 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> We note that this rule also requires notification of the affected broadcast station, although in such instances the deletion will be at the request of the broadcaster. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

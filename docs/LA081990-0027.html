			<p><P> August 19, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A LITTLE JOKE, MAYBE  </P> <P> I think that Terri D. Keville, in her Aug. 12 letter on David Shaw's "How to  Train a Baby Gourmet," didn't get the joke.  </P> <P> The article was clearly tongue-in-cheek. Surely no one is obtuse enough to  declare that baby Lucas didn't "bother anyone" and then go on to describe the  child as "banging his spoon and screeching with pleasure."  </P> <P> It was a joke, Terri.  </P> <P> Wasn't it. . . ?  </P> <P> DEBORAH WOODARD HEALY  </P> <P> Northridge8/19/90  </P></p>

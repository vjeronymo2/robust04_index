			<p><P> January 20, 1990, Saturday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> $500,000 IN ANTIQUES, INCLUDING SHERMAN'S SWORD, RECOVERED  </P> <P> Investigators say they have recovered more than $500,000 in stolen antiques --  including two centuries-old violins and a sword reportedly used by Civil War  Gen. William T. Sherman.  </P> <P> The merchandise, which included books, coin collections, toy cars and guns, was  found Thursday in a storage locker.  </P> <P> Police have arrested 29 people since a grand jury in Columbus, Ohio, returned  secret indictments on Jan. 2 in connection with an Ohio-based burglary ring,  but no arrests involving the Savannah cache have been made.  </P> <P> The Sherman-related items, which included a portrait of the Union general, were  stolen from the museum at Sherman's birthplace in Lancaster, Ohio,  investigators said.  </P></p>

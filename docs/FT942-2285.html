			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / World Bond Markets: Tokyo Japanese government bond prices have been weakening in tandem with international bond markets, but have also been hit by rising expectations of an economic recovery. Shifts in funds from bonds to stocks are likely to continue this week. Massive selling by foreign and domestic institutions depressed the No 164 10-year government bond last week pushing up the yield to 4.41 per cent, the highest since June last year. Economic data to be released this week is likely to confirm such views, placing further pressure on bond prices. The diffusion index for April, the leading indicator for business sentiment, which is scheduled to be released tomorrow, is expected to be sharply higher than the 'boom or bust' line of 50. The weakness in the government bond market prompted the ministry of finance to postpone its four-year bond offering for the third consecutive week. The government is expected to offer 10-year bonds next week and traders now regard the medium-term bond as unlikely to be issued this month. 'Recovery fever is gripping the market,' says Mr Marshall Gittler, bond analyst at Merrill Lynch in Tokyo. He expects continued weakness in the bond market this week, with the yield curve steepening, as the central bank is likely to maintain short-term interest rates at the current low levels.</p>

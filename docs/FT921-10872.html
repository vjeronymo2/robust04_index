			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / Italian poll could force huge changes THE dissolution of the Italian parliament and the calling of general elections on April 5 has opened the way for an upheaval in Italian politics. This will primarily focus on the ability of the main political parties to convince a disillusioned electorate they are still capable of carrying out the reforms necessary to enable convergence with Italy's principal European partners. Another political contest involves intricate horse-trading to decide who will be the country's next prime minister and who will succeed President Francesco Cossiga when his term of office ends in July. Both are inter-related because any collapse in the vote for the traditional parties, especially the Christian Democrats who have ruled uninterrupted since the Second World War, could affect the candidacy to the presidency. The forthcoming elections are also the first since the break up of the Soviet Union and the fall of communism in eastern Europe. As such they will test the strength of electoral support for Italy's ideologically bereft left, until last year represented by the Communists, the strongest opposition party, now regrouped round the Party of the Democratic Left (PDS). The outgoing government, headed by the veteran Christian Democrat leader, Mr Giulio Andreotti, is Italy's 50th in the post-war period. The legislature, Italy's 10th, should have concluded in May but the increasing difficulty of holding together the Christian Democrats, Socialists, Social Democrats and Liberals in the four-party coalition has led Mr Andreotti to concede that his mandate is exhausted. Indeed, the bitter infighting which has characterised recent months, not least over the 1992 budget, has underlined the inadequacies of an electoral system which produces coalition governments. The ever controversial President Cossiga appears determined to make sure that the political ground rules will change. Secure in the knowledge of a powerful groundswell of support, Mr Cossiga wants to see genuine reform through parliament. The alternative, he says, is an ill-controlled reform movement inspired by referendums. Announcing the dissolution of parliament, he launched an open attack on his former Christian Democrat colleagues and the opposition PDS, urging Italians to desert and permit political reform. The enmity between Mr Cossiga and Mr Andreotti not only risks upsetting the Christian Democrats' electoral calculations but also the question of succession to the presidency. If he were constitutionally able, Mr Cossiga would like to stand again. As this is unlikely, he seems out to spoil Mr Andreotti's ambition.</p>

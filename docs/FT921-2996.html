			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / UK Company News: BTR disposals and Hawker Canada stake may be sold BTR, the industrial conglomerate, has sold two businesses acquired through recent takeovers for Pounds 33.1m. It also said it was considering the sale of its majority stake in Hawker Siddeley Canada, valued at about CDollars 220m (Pounds 107m). The group acquired Hawker Siddeley last November for Pounds 1.55bn and said yesterday it was conducting a review of its interest in the Canadian subsidiary. BTR holds 59 per cent of HSC's common stock and 42 per cent of its preferred shares. BTR shares rose 2p to 406p. HSC has diverse manufacturing interests, including aircraft engine components, steel castings, and mining and forestry equipment. It also repairs jet engines and leases railway wagons. Profits fell last year from CDollars 23.7m to CDollars 11.3m, largely as a result of problems in British coal-mining and Canadian forestry industries. Bowater, the packaging and industrial films group, is buying the printing division of Rockware, which BTR bought last September in a Pounds 197m cash bid, for Pounds 15.3m. Bowater recently launched a Pounds 333.5m rights issue and announced two acquisitions of packaging groups for Pounds 444m. Mr David Lyon, chief executive of Bowater, said that the purchase of Rockware Printing had been under discussion even before BTR's bid. The deal would roughly double Bowater's market share in the bespoke business forms market to about 10 per cent. There could be some rationalisation of the business, he said. Rockware Printing's turnover in 1991 was Pounds 23m. Its profits and assets were not disclosed, but Mr Lyon said he thought Bowater was paying a fair price. The purchase is for cash and Mr Lyon said it would increase Bowater's gearing from 35 per cent to 38 per cent, after taking account of the rights issue and the other acquisitions. Bowater shares rose 1p to 770p. The other disposal BTR announced was of a 24 per cent stake in Bunnings, a quoted Australian timber products group, for ADollars 40.3m (Pounds 17.8m). The stake has been sold to Westfarmers, of Perth, Western Australia.</p>

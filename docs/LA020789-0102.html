			<p><P> February 7, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> DEPUTY PLEADS GUILTY TO REDUCED CHARGE  </P> <P> A reserve deputy with the Sheriff's Department and another man charged with  conspiring to plant heroin on a woman to whom the deputy owed money instead  pleaded guilty Monday to charges of fraudulent use of a law enforcement  computer.  </P> <P> As part of a plea bargain, charges involving the heroin against the deputy,  Donald Ernstmeyer, 36, and Edward Kazarian, 43, are expected to be dismissed  when the two men are sentenced in Superior Court in San Fernando on March 20,  Deputy Dist. Atty. Ken Barshop said. An investigation failed to turn up  sufficient evidence to support the conspiracy charges, Barshop said.  </P> <P> Authorities were tipped off about the alleged drug-planting scheme and arrested  Ernstmeyer and Kazarian on April 14 before the plan could be carried out,  police said. No heroin was seized in the arrests.  </P> <P> The woman who was to have been the victim of the drug scheme once worked for  Ernstmeyer at an equipment rental company he owned in the Santa Clarita Valley,  police said. The woman, who was not identified, was planning to take legal  action against Ernstmeyer to collect a $3,700 debt, authorities said.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From 3 May HOMMIKULEHT, p 1; "News Bulletin" No. 84] </F>   [Text] MP [member of parliament] Mart Niklus, vice  chairman of the Independent faction, presented a report of the  Defence League Tartu unit of a secret meeting of Russian  officers held in Tartu on 23 April and concerning the  organisation of an armed coup.    The plans concern all Estonia's regions and the conspirators  have the necessary armament, Niklus told yesterday's traditional  picket at the Russian Naval HQ. The intended date is not known  yet, he admitted.    Niklus added that subversive groups are located in several  towns and they intend to present their actions to the  international public as a civil war, which would justify the  intervention of the Russian Army.    Niklus also claimed that the evacuation of the Paldiski  nuclear reactors will cost the Estonian taxpayers 10 million  kroons and called for the suspension of granting residence  permits to aliens until the completion of the troops withdrawal.    Riigikogu [parliament] Vice Chairman Tunne Kelam later  dismissed the call, explaining that the suspension would be an  unreasonable act.</p>

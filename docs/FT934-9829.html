			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / Business and the Law: Law Society calls for end to tribunal limits - Legal Briefs The recent decision of the European Court of Justice, forcing the UK to remove the statutory Pounds 11,000 cap on compensation in sex and race discrimination cases, has prompted the Law Society to call for limits to be lifted in all industrial tribunal cases. Mrs Janet Gaymer, a partner of City solicitors Simmons &amp; Simmons and head of the society's Employment Law Committee, says tribunals cannot offer justice if they cannot offer proper compensation. The present Pounds 11,000 limit in non-discrimination cases should be more than Pounds 30,000 just to keep pace with wage inflation since 1975, she says. The society believes tribunals should be able to compensate people in full, whatever the nature of their claim. But if the government is not prepared to change the law, it should at least increase the maximum award levels to take account of inflation. Industrial tribunals are also hampered, says Mrs Gaymer, because they cannot take account of a person's earnings over Pounds 205 a week, so anyone earning more than Pounds 10,670 a year is likely to lose out. The only correct course for the government is to remove all limits, she says.</p>

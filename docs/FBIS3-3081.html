The increase was the highest in five years, and helped  machinery exports account for 7.85 percent of Taiwan's total  exports last year, up 7.2 percent from 1992, the association  said. It added that the importance of the machinery industry to  Taiwan's economy has been increasing noticeably thanks to  continuously growing exports.    Market dealers attributed the eye-catching performance by  the  industry to the depreciation of the New Taiwan dollar and the  successful exploitation of the mainland Chinese market by local  machinery manufacturers.    They quoted customs tallies as saying that Taiwan sold  US$2.43 billion worth of machinery to Hong Kong last year, with  most of that being transshipped to Mainland China, an increase  of US$928 million, or 61 percent, from 1992. Excluding exports  to Mainland China, export volume grew by only US$128.3 million,  or 3 percent.    The mainland market was the top export market for the  machinery industry last year, absorbing as much as 37 percent of  Taiwan's machinery exports. The United States took US$1.14  billion, or 17.2 percent, of Taiwan's machinery exports, and  Thailand, US$36.6 million.    But the growing presence of Taiwan-made machinery in  Mainland  China is also a clear indication that the reliance of local  machinery makers on the mainland market is increasing and that  the mainland fever among Taiwan business people has not eased  despite the government's call for market diversification,  industry sources said.</p>

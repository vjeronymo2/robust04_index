			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 26 (AFP)--China warned Washington on  Thursday against attaching any conditions to the renewal of its  preferential trading status with the United States, stressing  that such a move would be "unwise." "The attaching of  conditions will be unacceptable to the Chinese side," Foreign  Ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin told a weekly press briefing.    .U.S President Bill Clinton is widely expected to renew  China's most-favoured-nation (MFN) status before the weekend but  with limited sanctions that could involve a ban on imports of  weapons and ammunition made by the Chinese military.    "The unilateral exertion of pressure and adoption of  restrictive measures with regard to trade... is not in  conformity with international practises," Wu said, adding that  any decision to impose limited sanctions "would be unwise." "We  hope that the U.S. President will make a suitable decision," he  said.    Wu refused to comment on what steps China would take should  conditions be attached to MFN.    Clinton warned last year that renewal of China's MFN status,  which brings the lowest available US tariffs on imports,  depended on China showing "overall significant progress" in  human rights.    He outlined seven areas needing improvement before the June  3  deadline for deciding on whether to maintain China's MFN status  for another year, and asked US Secretary of State Warren  Christopher to make a report.    Clinton officials said Christopher found China had met the  minimum requirements in two areas: cooperation in ending the  export of prison-made goods and allowing relatives of some  dissidents to leave the country.    Reacting to reports that Clinton might also seek to set up a  U.S. commission to monitor China's progress on human rights, Wu  said dialogue "can be conducted with regard to the difference  over the issue of human rights between China and the United  States." However, he reiterated that China was opposed to any  interference in its intenal affairs.    China has repeatedly protested the linking of MFN renewal  with the human rights issue.</p>

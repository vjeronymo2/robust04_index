			<p><P> February 27, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THIS BAND'S MISSION IS A PLACE, NOT A CRUSADE, SAY MUSICIANS;  </P> <P> POP: THE GROUP IS DRAWING ATTENTION FOR ITS UNCOMMON SOUND. ITS FIRST NATIONAL  TOUR INCLUDES A STOP TONIGHT AT BOGART'S IN LONG BEACH.  </P> <P> The innocence part of the band the Innocence Mission is pretty easy to figure.  </P> <P> The young quartet of clean-cut friends who went to Catholic high school  together in semi-rural Lancaster, Pa., certainly looks innocent, and the tone  of the band's songs is one of poetic simplicity. Singer-songwriter Karen Peris  even makes her own plain, Amish-inspired clothing.  </P> <P> But what's the group's mission?  </P> <P> "The mission in the name is a place to us, as opposed to a crusade," said  Peris, 26, sitting with her husband, guitarist Don Peris, at A&amp;M Records'  Hollywood offices recently. The group was preparing to launch its first  national tour, which includes a stop tonight at Bogart's in Long Beach.  </P> <P> "The name is just something I thought of one day and we liked it," Karen  continued. "It made me think of the giant houses in children's books where you  might find a refuge."  </P> <P> It's an uncommon attitude for a band with an uncommon sound. The Innocence  Mission's recent debut album has drawn comparisons to the haunting, dreamy  styles of Kate Bush, the Cocteau Twins and Joni Mitchell (whose husband, Larry  Klein, produced the record).  </P> <P> At the center are Karen's ethereal vocals and keyboards, with support from  Don's guitar and loping rhythms from bassist Mike Bitts and drummer Steve  Brown. But most noteworthy are her vivid lyrics, with imagery and emotions that  conjure the spirit of Emily Dickinson.  </P> <P> "I have all her records!" joked Don, 25, when Dickinson's name was mentioned.  </P> <P> But Karen said, "I haven't read much poetry, except for Rilke, a German poet  and writer -- really simple, beautiful language. But that was only recently."  </P> <P> And while many reviewers have suggested that her songs reflect the aura of  their hometown, population 54,000 and in the heart of Amish country, Karen is  less certain.  </P> <P> "It's hard to say how the environment affected us," she said. "I've never  written about the area or the people. But I'm sure we've been affected by  seeing our parents act out their faith. Catholics are not often very vocal  about their faith, but I learned it through their actions, the way they treated  people and did things."  </P> <P> For all that, the group's history is your basic saga of an American band.  </P> <P> "I met Karen and the other guys in high school and put the band together after  we graduated," Don said. "We played in Steve's garage while we went to college  until '86, when we started putting most of our energy into the band. We were  always making demo tapes at a local studio and wanted to start to see what  could happen, and through the help of an attorney in New York we got a tape  around to people, one of whom was with A&amp;M."  </P> <P> Continued Karen: "We'd been playing live shows three or four months before  that, and then for a few months record company scouts would come hear us in  Philadelphia, where we played most. We had a nice following but weren't a big  thing there like the Hooters or Tommy Conwell."  </P> <P> From there it was a fairly standard series of events: signing a record  contract, coming to Los Angeles to record, getting a fair amount of college and  alternative radio airplay and some video airings on VH-1 and MTV's  "alternative" showcase "120 Minutes," all complementing the generally positive  reviews.  </P> <P> But, needless to say, this is not a band that slots nicely into the fast-paced  rock 'n' roll world.  </P> <P> "I think about it sometimes," said Karen, taking a long pause to contemplate  how the forces of show biz might play on them. "Things are definitely getting  busier, and at times it's hard to take. But for the most part we try to be what  we always have been."  </P> <P>  The Innocence Mission and Peter Himmelman play tonight at 8:30 at Bogart's in  the Marina Pacifica Mall, 6272 E. Pacific Coast Highway, Long Beach.  Information: (213) 594-8976.  </P> <P> </P></p>

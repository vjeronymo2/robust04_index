			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: Rolls-Royce The current contest to produce the world's most powerful aero engine seems to be driven by machismo. While very high thrust engines are required for new wide-body twin-engined jets, the recent tests of the GE90 and Rolls-Royce's Trent engines produce 25 per cent more power than such aircraft currently require. At present only the Airbus A330 and the Boeing 777 need these engines, yet GE, Pratt &amp; Whitney and Rolls have all invested hundreds of millions in this technology while orders have been scarce. All three have to compete on power and price for what business there is. In that context, Rolls' loss of the engine order for Japan Airlines' new Boeing 777s is disappointing but unsurprising. JAL can hardly afford to spend lavishly and, since two other Japanese airlines have already specified Pratt engines for their 777 fleets, JAL has an incentive to share maintainance facilities. Rolls may be leading the race for orders on the Airbus 330, but is lagging badly with the more significant Boeing 777. That has stretched out the pay-back period for the Trent. Perhaps even more significantly, the market may not grow rapidly enough to justify the investment in three such engines. With orders unlikely to pick up for at least two years, competition will intensify. Pratt and GE both have deeper pockets than Rolls, and bigger balance sheets to support a protracted fight. They are also less dependent on the aerospace cycle. Rolls' rating of 50 times likely 1993 earnings seems to reflect more than generously the company's own sunny optimism.</p>

			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / Pay deals below German inflation About 1.4m German construction workers will receive 2.4 per cent pay rises this year, following a deal agreed on Saturday. The award is the biggest so far this year, but still below forecast inflation of 3 per cent. The IG Bau union and the industry's two employers' federations have to approve the deal formally by April 20. About 500,000 workers with specialist qualifications will receive an extra 3 pfennigs an hour, giving them a total rise of 2.5 per cent. Negotiations in Frankfurt looked likely to fail because of union demands that pay for 375,000 construction workers in eastern Germany should match levels in the west. Under the agreement, eastern pay will reach 90 per cent of western levels from September 1. The bulk of pay settlements is now out of the way following earlier deals, all below inflation, for engineering, chemical, public sector and bank workers. A pay agreement for about 400,000 print workers is still outstanding.</p>

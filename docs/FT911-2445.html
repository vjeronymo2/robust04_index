			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / Survey of Singapore (15): Services open up an undesirable world - Communications: doubts about controls NOTHING has struck home as vividly to some people in Singapore as theoften-told tale of traders who sold US dollars immediately after watching on Cable News Network the faces of Mr James Baker, US Secretary of State and Mr TariqAziz, Iraq's then foreign minister, after failure to resolve the Gulf crisis. Singapore bankers and businessmen, on the other hand, bought US dollars and were left 'holding the baby', as one observer put it. The difference in reactions was that the sellers could see and size up instantly what was happening based on real time information. The difference from hearing of the event minutes later on the radio could mean millions of dollars lost. This fact was noted by those promoting Singapore as a leading foreign exchange and financial futures centre, one whose traders require up-to-date news. The fast pace of technology is forcing Asian governments to re-think their control over whatis seen by their populace. Most are wary of the unsettling effect of undesirable western influences portrayed on entertainment programmes and films. However, control is becoming increasingly moot when technology can make receivers small enough to fit into a suitcase. In deciding to open up to more instant and global communications, Singapore acknowledges that rapid advances in broadcast technology will force the examination of its policies on trans-boundary broadcasting and cable television. The republic boasts many world firsts in introducing the latest in telecommunications but has lagged in the areas of privately-installed satellite dishes, cable and global television. By contrast, satellite dishes are operating in Hong Kong, Indonesia, South Korea and the Philippines. The acting minister for information and the arts (Mita) Mr George Yeosaid: 'One day it may not be possible for the government to regulate but, for as long as it is possible . . . let's have some controls in place.' The t rade-off was that, for the controls to work, there had to be more choices for the public. Hence, the scheme to introduce two or three more ultra high frequencytelevision channels within a year, later moving on to microwave and cable. Many will be pay channels charged on a subscription basis to meet the needs ofspecific segments of the community. An arrangement may be negotiated with the BBC's World Service TV. Mita's reckoning of 10 to 15 years before regulations against household satellite dishes become impractical is too long, argued outspoken government MP, Mr Lim Boon Heng. He believes that global television must come soon because 'if we aim to be a global city. Is it to be soon or in 10 to 15 years' time?' In response to repeated lobbying by the financial community for access to CNN and other foreign news stations, the government will be issuing temporary licences of SDollars 1,000 to financial institutions and government bodies to operate satellite television receive-only dishes to get live newsbroadcasts. All institutions, except hotels and households, can now applyfor annual satellite dish licences from May 1. However, the strait-laced thinking persists in the barring of households in case 'one day, someone were to put up a pornographic channel and all Singaporeans are able to receive it. Is it good or not good for us?' Mr Yeo explained. However, it is not good enough to just get on-line real time market-sensitive information, there has to be an accompanying liberalisation of censorship of news and entertainment programmes. The long awaited film classification system begins on July 1 with a restricted category barring viewers under 18 years old and X-rated films that are banned. Censorship rules for publications and performances will be reviewed. Mr Goh Chok Tong, prime minister, set up Mita to help inform, educate and entertain as part of Singapore's goal; to make the republic a hub city of the world; and to build an economically dynamic, socially-cohesive, and culturally-vibrant society. He wants to pay more attention to public and media relations to better explain public policies at home and abroad. This and the relaxation of censorship acknowledges the growing sophistication of a people who travelled widely and often enough to know what the West offers. As for the communications infrastructure, the business-like nation has strived to make it easy for multinationals to do business in Singapore. 'We have no natural resources. To make a living, we have to find a market for our goods and services. They have to beof quality and at competitive prices. To do that, we need a good communicationsinfrastructure. Whether you are a manufacturer, trader or forex dealer, you need good communication links to compete worldwide,' said Mr Tan Guong Ching, permanent secretary at the communications ministry. Singapore has invested heavily in its communications infrastructure and stressed excellent service. To maintain its advances in communications, it is building a third air terminal, reclaiming land for a fourth terminal and third runway; building a new container portat Pulau Brani; and participating in an Asean all-optical fibre cable network. Singapore was the first to offer nationwide Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) where a Group 4 fax machines sends messages five times faster at costs lowered by as much as 80 per cent. Telephone rates are constantly being lowered, by as much as 40 per cent to some countries; Singapore has the highest ratio of IDD calls, the most advanced photo-videotex service, the largest number ofpagers and cellular phones per capita. When floated next year, Singapore Telecom will be the largest local company, with a market capitalisation of SDollars 10bn. It grew to become highly profitable by offering the latest innovations, competitive rates, and good services. Like Singapore Airlines, it has learnt that instead of shutting out the world, it can offer its services anywhere, and be a world beater.</p>

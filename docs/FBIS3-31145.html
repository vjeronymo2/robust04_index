The vice-chairman of the party, Mr. Servet Pellumbi said  that  the country is going over a political crisis and presented the  alternative of the Socialist Party for the ruling of the country.    He presented once more the request of this party for  premature elections in Autumn, this year. Although he admitted  some of the economic achievements such as the creation of the  legislation for the market economy, the creation of a new class  of businessmen, stopping of inflation, Mr. Pellumbi accused the  Democratic Party "for causing the tense political situation in  the country, for non-allowance of different alternatives, and  for violation of the human rights and freedoms," underlining the  arrest of the leader of the Socialist Party, Mr. Fatos Nano.    The Socialist Party, stressed the report held in conference,  asked for the approval of the constitution and for the  functioning of the round table of the parties.    "The Socialist Party is for a unique national strategy and  for a long-term plan in carrying out our national question,"  stressed the report. It asked the democratic state to give to  the market social and human dimensions.    The Socialist Party declared itself against the  privatization  of some strategic sectors of the economy, against the taxes  assessed on the farmers this year as well as against the  dispersion of the agricultural enterprises.    Mr. Pellumbi appreciated the steps undertaken in order to  pass the isolation of Albania and supported the development of  the process of the international relations. He condemned the  unprecedent violence of the Serbians in Bosnia and expressed his  support for the Albanian brothers in Kosova, who are under the  wild terror of Serbia.    Mr. Pellumbi expressed also in favour of the Albania's  participation in the initiative "Partnership For Peace" and in  favour of the strengthening of the friendly relations with  neighbours and other countries in Europe and world.    A message of greetings sent by the chairman of the party,  Mr.  Fatos Nano, was read in the conference. Mr. Nano is in prison  under the charge of abuse of duty and falsification of the  official documents in 1991 when he was the premier of Albania.</p>

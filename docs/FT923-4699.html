			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / International Company News: Modest rise in sales for US stores MOST OF the big US retailers saw only modest increases in comparable store sales during August - further indication of the sluggish recovery in the economy. However, a number warned comparisons with August 1991 had been affected by the relatively late Labor Day this year, which marks the official end of summer and children's return to school. Some 'back-to-school' spending, it was suggested, had been pushed into the current month. 'The impact of this calendar shift was most evident in apparel and other back-to-school merchandise in those sections of the country where school openings have been delayed,' commented K mart, the large discount retailer. K mart saw a 1.7 per cent increase during August, with the general merchandise side posting a 0.6 per cent improvement and the speciality chains - ranging from the Payless drug stores to Waldenbooks - advancing by 4.7 per cent. At Woolworth, there was a 2.5 per cent rise in domestic same store sales, while Sears reported a 3.5 per cent improvement. Among the big department store groups, Dallas-based J C Penney fared well, with a 12.4 per cent rise in same store sales in its main division, and a 12.6 per cent gain at its drug store outlets. But at Neiman Marcus, there was a more restrained 3.9 per cent rise in comparable store sales; at Dayton Hudson, a flat performance; and at May Department Stores, a 1.2 per cent decline. Wal-Mart, the expansion-minded discount chain which is now the nation's largest retailer, managed a creditable 10 per cent improvement in same store sales - although even this was slightly below the 12 per cent improvement seen in the first seven months to end-August. At The Gap, the fashion retailer, same-store sales gained 6 per cent.</p>

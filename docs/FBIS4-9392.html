			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jelena Dabarcic] </F>   [Text] Peace is gradually returning to the Gorazde front.  Only sporadic sniper fire has come from the Muslim side today.  The UN troops are taking up positions in their designated  locations. The Karadzic-Akashi agreement is being implemented.  Units of the army of the Srpska republic are withdrawing to the  lines 3 km from the center of Gorazde, while the heavy artillery  has been withdrawn to 20 km from the town.    The Serbian civilians who fled their houses before the  Muslim  army's advance two years ago are returning to burnt and  destroyed villages on the right bank of the Drina River.  UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] (?represent a guarantee) to them  to return and continue to live safely in their destroyed houses.    The Muslim army has been defeated on the Gorazde front.  Their offensive did not succeed. Of their four brigades, with  more than 8,000 troops, three have been crushed. This was  stated by Colonel Jezdimir Lakicevic from the Herzegovina Corps  command during today's meeting with correspondents reporting  from this front. He stressed that in their counteroffensives,  members of the army of the Srpska republic liberated an area of  170 square kilometers. The units of the Herzegovina Corps,  commanded by General Radovan Grubac, liberated 100 square  kilometers themselves.    This has created the conditions for the Serbs who have fled  the area to return to their hearths. Herzegovina has in this  way obtained the shortest possible route to Serbia, this officer  said. According to Colonel Lakicevic, the world has finally  realized that its investment in Alija's army was futile.    In the fighting on the Gorazde front, the Herzegovina Corps  lost 30 fighters killed and 160 were wounded. Of these 40 were  more seriously wounded.</p>

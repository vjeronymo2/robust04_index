			<p>Language: <F P=105>Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Slovak Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik by </F> Radiozurnal editor Michal Tvarozek; place and date not given;  from the "Ten Minutes with the Prime Minister" program--recorded]    [Text] [Tvarozek] At the beginning of this week, you were  in Prague, where you met Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus for  unofficial talks. There are certain signs from which one can  assume that both the prime minister and the Czech Government are  still a bit restrained in their contacts with the new Slovak  Government. Do you think the reason for this might be that they  are trying to keep a back door open in case Vladimir Meciar  returns?    [Moravcik] I was taking part in the European Banking Forum  and used this opportunity to meet Prime Minister Klaus, whom I  know very well from my previous activity. Our talks can be  characterized, mainly on the part of Vaclav Klaus, as a kind of  finding out how we [the Slovak Government] think and what this  government intends to do in the short period of six months. I  think we managed to agree that, in this period of six months,  there is enough space to intensify our mutual contacts and that  we are confident we are able to solve some still unresolved  problems.    [Tvarozek] Do you already have any idea how to keep contacts  and resolve some of the pressing issues?    [Moravcik] I am not going to talk about specific actions,  specific proposals, and measures because all of this is in the  stage of intensive preparations. I do not wish to jump the gun  now and generate some media hullabaloo.    [Tvarozek] Despite this, I would like to touch on one  specific issue, which is the issue of the common border. It has  not been finalized yet, and some points of contention exist.  Are you going to change anything in the concept of possible  mutual compensation for territories, or have some other options  been prepared in this respect?    [Moravcik] We are prepared to follow the results achieved at  the interior minister level of the two countries. I think a  certain basis offering solutions does actually exist here. At  the same time, we must make sure, in a very vigorous way, that  complete compensation for the territories is implemented. Quite  simply, I think it is possible to discuss this issue or this  problem so that the interests of our two republics are taken  into consideration to the maximum possible, or full extent.    [Tvarozek] It is natural that each prime minister or  minister  brings with him to his new office a circle of his colleagues on  whom he can rely. But is there a limit to this? Some  ministries are axing people who do not actually hold top jobs.  The same can be said about some district councils. Prime  Minister, is there not a chance that fears of uncertainty or of  some kind of mutual settling of accounts might arise?    [Moravcik] It would be very counterproductive to talk about  a  settling of accounts. I definitely oppose this kind of  practice. I think we should follow the policy aimed at adopting  a professional and expert approach. We agreed on this, we  agreed on this in the government and during the coalition talks.  Thus, we have a certain policy, and we wish to steadfastly  stick to it.    [Tvarozek] In this respect, would it not be a solution if  the  state secretaries were appointed by the parliament so that their  appointments would not be the outcome of coalition talks, but  that, as experts, they would form a permanent structure in the  ministries and so on?    [Moravcik] The state secretaries position must not be  regarded as a constant in our constitutional system. They are a  composite part of the executive power, and, in fact, they  deputize for the minister to a considerable extent. Thus, from  this viewpoint, if they were elected by the parliament, this  would not be a composite part of the whole constitutional system.    [Tvarozek] As early as at the first government meeting, you  abolished the decision of the former government and dismissed  the regional job center commissioners. What were the reasons  that compelled you to do this?    [Moravcik] These institutions were not legally justified,  and, because we have put off the territorial division of the  state until after the elections, they were not justified in  material terms, either.    [Tvarozek] Is this not a political issue then?    [Moravcik] There is a political aspect to this issue because  maintaining these offices would have contradicted Slovakia's  interests.    [Tvarozek] The so-called screening law has been a much  discussed issue of late. Although this law is in force, it is  not observed everywhere and, from time to time, as happened  recently, contradictory findings surface. Prime Minister, do  you have any idea what course of action you are going to take?  Are you going to observe it and demand that it is strictly  adhered to, or are you going to table an amendment to this law?    [Moravcik] The screening law is a part of our legal system.  This means that the government must respect it. That is one  thing. At the present time, a proposal as to whether this law  conforms to our Constitution and to our international  undertakings has been lodged at the Constitutional Court. We  will wait and see what the Constitutional Court verdict is, and  then we might make a decision.    [Tvarozek] It is reported that teachers are preparing  protest  actions for 27 March because this is Teachers' Day. Other  professional associations voiced their dissatisfaction with  social conditions, too. Are you preparing any measures of  fundamental importance that would prevent such high escalation  of dissatisfaction?    [Moravcik] Unfortunately, the state budget does not allow  for  fundamental measures that would completely eliminate the problem  that exists in this ministry or in this sphere. But we  definitely want to do something. We have already started  discussing this issue with the relevant trade unions.    [Tvarozek] The budget can be replenished, above all, by the  results of our work or by exports. What is being prepared in  this respect? It is precisely at this time, when Defense  Minister Pavol Kanis and some specialists are visiting Israel.  Do you expect that developments of this kind will result in  closer contacts with foreign partners?    [Moravcik] We are currently defining our policies or, in  other words, the policy statement of the government. It should  be a very specific and matter-of-fact document. Written in it  will be the basic measures we want to implement. We will make  use of our diplomacy and our foreign contacts to gain aid from  abroad.    [Tvarozek] The government has been in office for one week  now. How do you assess its work, and do you have any comments on  or objections to the work of any ministries or ministers?    [Moravcik] It is a very short time for me to pass any  judgment, but, on the basis of the information I have so far, I  can unequivocally say that there is a very strong will and  enough enthusiasm to enable us to solve all of the problems we  have set ourselves to solve.    [Tvarozek] The government really consists of three elements,  so to speak. The degree of consistency of these three elements  will most probably depend on the goals. If we take those six  months, for example, is the goal identical?    [Moravcik] We are trying to define this identical goal, but  we do not want it to be limited by six months. We said to  ourselves that we must draft a concept for long-term development  and decide which steps we have to take in order to implement  this long-term concept over the six months because we are  expecting this political grouping to retain an important  influence after the elections, as well.    [Tvarozek] Do you mean an important influence in the  government, in parliament, or an important influence as a strong  opposition group?    [Moravcik] Well, our aim is to win a majority.</p>

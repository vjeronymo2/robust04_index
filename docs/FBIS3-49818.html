			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Petrovac, Jan 14 (TANJUG) -- Fierce intra-Moslem  clashes between forces of the radical Bosnian Moslem leader  Alija Izetbegovic and his rival Fikret Abdic continue Friday [14  January] on all fronts in western Bosnia while Izetbegovic  terrorist groups are trying lo arrest Abdic.    Under Abdic's leadership Moslems from the Cazin Krajina  declared the autonomous province of western Bosnia in September  last year in defiance of Izetbegovic's war option. They urged  for the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina, which broke out in April  1992, to be solved through negotiations with Bosnian Serbs and  Bosnian Croats with whom Abdic signed seperate peace accords.  The fiercest fighting is reported by local Moslem media of the  Cazin Krajina to be going on around Trsce and Trzacka Rastela,  places taken three days ago by the Abdic forces.    The autonomous province agency ZBIA reports that Izetbegovic  forces have launched an all-out attack but that they cannot  penetrate the lines held by the Abdic forces and have therefore  sent several sabotage and terrorist groups to try to get into  Velika Kladusa, the political center of the province, and arrest  Abdic.    The agency reports that one of the groups was eliminated in  the vicinity of Todorovo, by Velika Kladusa.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Italicized passages recorded] </F>   [Text] The National Union for the Total Independence of  Angola [UNITA] is moving its troops from Huambo to the martyred  city of Kuito. Our correspondent Abel Abraao reports from Kuito:    [Abraao] The Black Cockerel troops, in a vain attempt  to storm and take over the city of Kuito before the Lusaka talks  are concluded, once again shelled with heavy artillery all parts  of the capital of Bie Province, at the same time launching a  direct attack on the positions of government forces. A reliable  and well informed source from the operation command in Bie today  told our newsdesk that over the past few hours Jonas Savimbi's  organization sent five container trucks with troops carrying  long-, medium- and short-range weapons to the outskirts of  Kuito. The same source added that over the past 62 hours the  government forces killed 43 UNITA rebels and captured six AKM  weapons, two PKM's, an N-79 weapon, and an assortment of  ammunition and anti-tank mines.    At present clashes are under way in the south of the  city, with government forces inflicting heavy losses on Jonas  Savimbi's UNITA. The Kuito residents did not go to the streets  searching for food, wood and water this morning because UNITA  soldiers have been shooting at everything and everyone. Thus,  as well as civilians dying due to military activities, the  number of people dying of famine is also growing, having reached  alarming proportions.    On the southern front the situation has been described as  stationary, judging by the movements of the UNITA rebels all  over the region. Colonel Antonio Alberto Manuel, spokesman for  the Southern Military Front has said these movements are taking  part in the north of Matala District, particularly in the  Cuvelai, Cai and Mufa areas. Our correspondent reports from the  Huila Provincial Station in Lubango:    [Unidentified correspondent] The spokesman of the  Military Southern Front says that there are three battalions of  the rebel movement in Quilengues and two in Matala District.  Questioned about whether the situation may become serious, Col.  Antonio Alberto Manuel stressed that everything is serious for  the soldiers and that everything is being done to contain this  wave of movements. In operations mounted by government forces  in response to UNITA attacks, a number of Jonas Savimbi's troops  were killed, and an unspecified number of others were taken  prisoner.    The Ebo District in Cuanza Sul Province is still under the  control of the government forces despite the enemy's attempts to  take over the city. Operation Command Spokesman Colonel Calado  says that UNITA lost 40 soldiers when trying to carry out yet  another criminal action against defenseless civilians. Our  correspondent reports from Cuanza Sul:    [Correspondent] The Angolan Armed Forces [FAA] senior  officer, who was speaking to our correspondent in Gabela, said  that the dead include a lieutenant colonel who had been head of  the Black Cockerel forces in the Eastern Front. He said violent  and bloody clashes took place in the Canhembe, Bengo and Serra  do Camuco areas, in which the government soldiers captured an  assortment of war materiel, notably 13 RPG-7 weapons, eight  AKM's and ammunition of several calibers. Colonel Calado  concluded his interview with JORNAL DE ANGOLA by saying that  government forces are totally in control of a radius 40 km from  Ebo and continue with what he described as punitive attacks on  Jonas Savimbi's soldiers in Waku Kungo, Quilenda and Ebo.    In Malanje, government forces this morning repelled a group  of UNITA soldiers whey they tried to infiltrate a position of  government forces in Cambondo. Our correspondent Francisco  Curingana reports from the area:    [Curingana] On that occasion the rebels left on the  ground 14 of their dead soldiers, 10 AK weapons, as well as an  anti-tank missile, eight 81 mm mortar shells, and an unspecified  number of infantry ammunition. Today, following an offensive by  government forces, yet another eight Armed Forces for the  Liberation of Angola [FALA] soldiers deserted their  colleagues and turned themselves over to government forces with  their weapons. Over the past two days, government forces put  out of action 151 rebels and captured seven bandits, and 39  others turned themselves in with their weapons. FALA 90th and  Intervention Battalions were totally defeated and withdrawn from  the theater of war.</p>

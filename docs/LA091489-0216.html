			<p><P> September 14, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> 'FISHBAIT' MILLER, COLORFUL HOUSE DOORKEEPER, DIES  </P> <P> William (Fishbait) Miller, a colorful figure who served as doorkeeper of the  House of Representatives for nearly 25 years, has died after a long illness. He  was 80.  </P> <P> Miller, who introduced six Presidents at joint sessions of Congress in his long  tenure and wrote a book, "Fishbait," about the politically powerful in  Washington, died of a heart attack at his home here Tuesday.  </P> <P> For years Miller would stride into the House chamber and bellow, "Mister  Speaker, the President of the United States" in his native Mississippi accent.  The joint session of Congress would applaud, and Miller would take a seat at  the front of the chamber.  </P> <P> During his 25 years as House doorkeeper, Miller introduced Presidents Truman,  Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon and Ford when they appeared to address the  Congress.  </P> <P> Despite the simple title, Miller's job entailed supervising 357 government  workers -- messengers, pages, restroom workers, janitors -- and a $3.5-million  budget.  </P> <P> Miller went to Washington in 1933 at the request of William Colmer, whom he had  just helped win election from Mississippi's 6th Congressional District.  </P> <P> Miller rose from a clerk in the House to messenger, sergeant-at-arms and  finally to the relatively powerful post of doorkeeper.  </P> <P> Except for one session, Miller held the job until 1974, when the House  Democratic majority did not reelect him.  </P></p>

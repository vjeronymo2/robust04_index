			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on economic developments monitored through 17 May.    Finance Minister Julio Sosa Rodriguez has announced that  Venezuela became a member of the Multilateral Investment  Guarantees Agency (MIGA) on 6 May by paying the $3,088,038 that  corresponds to the 20-percent subscription fee. By joining MIGA,  Venezuela acquires more guarantees in the flow of foreign  investment. (Caracas EL GLOBO in Spanish 10 May 94 p 12)    The Venezuelan Central Bank (BCV) reported on 10 May that  the  people have no need to fear an unstable bolivar, because the  drop in international reserves has been curbed. BCV President  Antonio Casas said, "There is no reason not to have faith in the  bolivar and in the country's economic future." The dollar  experienced a setback on 29 April when the bolivar rose from  118.30 per dollar to 123.50. On 10 May, the bolivar closed at  131.50. (Madrid EFE in Spanish 0112 GMT 11 May 94)    Foreign Trade Institute President Alberto Poletto has  announced that the abrupt break in trade talks between Colombia,  Mexico, and Venezuela to form a trade zone under the Group of  Three "does not mean the end or failure of the negotiations."  The foreign trade ministers of Mexico, Colombia, and Venezuela  will strive in the coming days to overcome the impasse created  in Bogota when Mexico tried to impose conditions the other two  countries did not accept. (Caracas REPORTE DE LA ECONOMIA in  Spanish 11 May 94 p 20)    Finance Ministry sources have reported that imports have  experienced a 40-percent decline. It is estimated that in 1994  exports will reach 10.2-10.5 billion dollars, compared to 1993's  10.9 billion dollar figure. According to the same sources, in  1993 the country sustained an economic reduction of 1 percent,  which is expected to reach 1.5 percent in 1994. (Caracas EL  NACIONAL in Spanish 11 May 94 p E-2)    During the first three months of 1994, Venezuela experienced  a slowdown characterized by spiraling inflation and declines in  the basic economic indicators. This is reflected in an economic  report prepared by the Presidency's Office of Coordination and  Planning. The price of oil, which is a touchstone used to assess  the country's revenues, was $12.33 per barrel, showing a  4.8-percent decline when compared to prices recorded in the last  three months of 1993.

			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / Arts: Whaddaya know, dreams come true - To his surprise, Martin Hoyle enjoys 'Copacabana' They came to sneer (well, some of us) and stayed to cheer (well, most of them). Copacabana is the musical based on the song by Barry Manilow. A tempting precedent for lazy impresarios who can now adapt any number of well-loved songs into plays and illuminate the West End with such titles as Ich Grolle Nicht and Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go. Let it be said at once that those of us who, with the open-mindedness of true criticism, approached this show with dread were pleasantly surprised. If you associate Manilow's music with the Weltschmerz of blue-rinsed matrons in sun-lounges, be reassured that these songs are new, fresh - though a threatened rendering of 'I Write the Songs' drew screams of recognition from the audience - and sometimes tuneful. Roger Redfarn's Plymouth-originated production is cheerful, spectacular, bouncy and shrewdly aimed at its market. Let curmudgeons complain. A show that cribs WS Gilbert's joke about composing and decomposing has pedigree. The framing story concerns a young song-writer, Steve (Gary Wilmot, immensely likable), who dreams up the title song as he strums at the piano. Dissolve into the play within a play; Steve becomes young song-writer Tony who falls for aspirant actress from Tulsa, one Lola (Nicola Dawn). We are transported to the interior of the Bodleian Library, Oxford, or possibly Grand Central Station, where a dozen young hopefuls in identical Andrews Sisters hairstyles arrive to make the big time. This is 1947 Broadway and after auditioning for South Pacific and Brigadoon Lola is taken on by the Copacabana nightclub. Here she attracts the attention of villainous Rico (Ronald Reagan in a moustache, though the programme calls him Richard Lyndon) and we are dazzled by showgirls in glitter wearing gilded grapes, gold pineapples and what in one case look like ungilded courgettes. 'This is the kind of glamour l used to dream about,' breathes Lola. Me too; l would wake up screaming. Rico says, 'Champagne should never be sipped; it should he consumed like life itself - with great passion.' His discarded mistress Conchita, also in glitter but no vegetables, is alarmed; she knows the signs. We then enjoy 'Bolero de Amor', one of those numbers where the girls wear fishnet stockings on their arms and the men tear their (the girls') skirts off. Tension mounts as Conchita (nicely played as a fading Chita Rivera type by Anna Nicholas) tries to warn off Lola with philosophy: 'Honee, too much dreaming can be dangerous.' Rico cruelly counters this with an Oxford linguistic snarl of 'Conchita has been telling her putrid lies again.' Drunk with the sophistication of it all, Lola is kidnapped to Havana ('Havana, Cuba?' she asks like another geographically disadvantaged heroine, Sarah Brown in Guys and Dolls) where Rico intends to have his way with her. In Rico's own nightclub, the Tropicana, Conchita and Her Boys (pleated flairs, frilly sleeves and nattily knotted boleros) sing of Havana in terms that recall 'It's Nicer in Nice' from The Boy Friend. The full extent of Rico's dastardly intentions towards the humiliated Lola then becomes clear. He forces her into a dance routine where she is captured by lithe-limbed pirates who finger her frills, rather enviously l thought. Tony effects their escape from Rico's clutches and the company does a big number addressed to 'Sweet Heaven' which I think reads a little too much into the deity's interest in aberrant showgirls. Back in his apartment young Tony/Steve wakes from his reverie, having fallen in love with his creation, Lola. (A duet, reality and fantasy never quite meeting, provides a moment of genuine charm.) But lo] The girl whom we have glimpsed in the framing narrative as a nag with a face-pack does her hair, puts on a frock and 'It's you]' he cries. And whaddaya know, his squabbling in-laws turn out to be the comically irascible club-owner Sam and wisecracking cigarette-girl Gladys (Jenny Logan) of his dream. He even gets to take the girlfriend's glasses off, thus transforming her, according to time-honoured alchemy, into a beauty. He decides to give the title song a happy ending. The critics realise that the evening has passed without actually hearing the number right through and, reckoning that for once they have the breaks, steal away.</p>

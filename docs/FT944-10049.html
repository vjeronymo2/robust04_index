			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Banks invited to take part in electricity offer The government yesterday began public preparations for the international offer of its shares in National Power and PowerGen, the electricity generators, by asking investment banks if they want to take part in the distribution. The Treasury wrote to the banks saying it would choose four or five global managers to work with Barclays de Zoete Wedd and Kleinwort Benson, who are advising the government on the flotation and acting as global co-ordinators. There will also be 10 regional managers. The decision to choose up to five global managers follows a report by the National Audit Office on the last sale of government shares in BT. This pointed out that although there were 11 global managers for the BT sale, most of the shares were distributed by a small number of banks. The international offer will be to UK institutions as well as overseas institutions and individuals. Banks interested in taking part in the retail sale, to private investors in the UK, have already been briefed on arrangements for the flotation. The government is selling its remaining 40 per cent stakes in the two companies. Marketing will start in January for a sale in February.</p>

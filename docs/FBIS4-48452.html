			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Patrick Bulger] </F>   [Text] Johannesburg May 19 SAPA -- The National  Peacekeeping Force [NPKF] will be disbanded within the next two  weeks, Defence Ministry and NPKF Spokesmen said on Thursday. An  announcement ending the NPKF's brief and inglorious life can be  expected as early as next Tuesday after the cabinet meets in  Cape Town. The actual disbandment could take place on June 2.    "Its disbandment is under consideration. I can't give an  indication when an announcement can be expected but it could be  soon," Defence Ministry spokesman Maj Charl de Klerk said. He  said there was still a number of technical considerations, such  as how NPKF members would be accommodated at their forces of  origin.    NPKF spokesman Col Connie van Rensburg said the NPKF was  waiting for an official announcement on its future. Asked  whether it would be retained in another form, Col van Rensburg  said: "I personally very much doubt it."    The NPKF was established in February. It was seldom out of  the headlines as reports of ill-discipline and insubordination  among the peace-keepers became commonplace. In military and  political circles it was called the "national peace-keeping  farce".    It was intended to keep peace during the election period.  But after a disastrous first outing on the East Rand during  which award-winning photographer Ken Oosterbroek was killed, the  NPKF was withdrawn to barracks.    Col van Rensburg said the South African National Defence  Force [SANDF] had already said it could accommodate about 1,200  members of Umkhonto We Sizwe [Spear of the Nation -- ANC armed  wing] who comprise the non-statutory component of the NPKF. The  Umkhonto members could be taken in at the SANDF assembly point  at Wallmannstal, north of Pretoria. The matter was discussed at  a meeting of the Joint Military Command Council [JMCC] in  Pretoria on Wednesday morning. The JMCC is overseeing the  restructuring and rationalisation of South Africa's statutory  and non-statutory forces.    Col van Rensburg said the original agreement was that the  2,800 members of statutory forces would be returned to their  forces of origin, namely the South African Police, the Transkei  Defence Force and the Venda Defence Force. He said legislation  providing for the establishment of the NPKF in the form of the  Transitional Executive Council act was no longer valid after the  inauguration of President Nelson Mandela last week.  Technically, the NPKF was now a non- statutory force.    Its members at De Brug in the Orange Free State and Koeberg  in the Western Cape were sitting around doing nothing. He said  training had stopped and the inactivity had potentially  demoralising consequences.</p>

			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Investing for Income): Convertibles with Pep  -Gillian O'Connor explains the finer points of an investment that needs careful planning The Budget changes are likely to allow investors to include many UK convertibles in their general personal equity plans after April 6 next year. Convertibles are riskier and more complicated than most other non-convertible bonds, and income investors should hold them in a well-spread portfolio. Many people will find it easier to buy them through a suitable unit or investment trust Pep. Some may want to buy a few individual convertibles to bump up the yield in a self-select Pep. Expert advice is probably essential. What is a convertible? It is a corporate loan stock or preference share which pays a fixed annual income and can also be exchanged for a pre-set number of ordinary shares of the same company at certain dates over a certain period. What is the difference between convertible loan stocks and convertible preference shares? Not much in practice. The main theoretical difference is that loan stock is part of a company's debt, not its capital, and has an earlier claim on the company's assets if it runs into trouble; preference shares are part of a company's capital and rank before the ordinary shares for dividend payments and for capital repayment. If a company is short of cash it might well skip a preference payment and hope to make good the omission when it can afford to; not paying interest on a loan stock brings a company into default and is not done lightly. Most convertibles have a pre-set repayment date. One difference that confuses many people is that the nominal annual dividend rate (coupon) on a preference share usually is quoted net of standard rate tax, whereas the coupon on loan stocks is quoted gross. So, if you pay tax at standard rate, your net income from an 8 per cent preference stock will be the same as from a 10 per cent loan stock. Just to add to the complications, some convertible prefs quote a dividend in pence per share rather than as a percentage. Note: some convertibles are preference shares - but not all preference shares are convertibles. Other preference shares are valued much like the comparable fixed interest securities. How do you work out your annual income? Ask your broker or look up the gross yield in the FT. Then net it down for your own tax rate if appropriate. Why buy convertibles? Two reasons. Some people are interested mainly in the income, others in the total eventual return. Different convertibles appeal to the two different buyers. How does the yield compare with that of fixed-interest stocks and shares? It is normally somewhere in between. A few convertibles offer yields as high as fixed interest stocks. They may suit income investors but are unlikely to be worth exchanging for shares for a very long time. How do movements in the market price of the convertible relate to those of the underlying shares? Convertibles are less volatile. Theory says that the higher the yield on the convertible, the more it behaves like a gilt and the less it responds to movements in the underlying shares. Those with lower yields follow the underlying share price more closely and appeal to equity investors worried about a sharp market fall. Theory does not always work in practice, though. High-yielding convertibles sometimes behave more like high-yielding shares than gilts. When markets are turbulent, convertible prices can be slow to adjust. How does the capital growth in convertibles compare with that of the underlying shares? It depends on the period you are looking at, what is happening to the market, and if you include re-invested income. Over the past six years, convertibles have outstripped the underlying shares if you assume gross income is re-invested, but done slightly worse with no income re-invested. They have done best when the market as a whole is rising. On a shorter time scale, convertibles tend to rise less rapidly than shares in a rising market, and fall less sharply in a falling one. How does conversion work? Take the British Aerospace convertible prefs. These can be converted on May 31 any year until 2007. Terms are 11.976 ordinary shares in BAe for every 100 convertible prefs. Otherwise, you are repaid at Pounds 100 in between 2007 and 2010. Conversion will provide the same capital sum only if the ordinary share price is at least 835p when you convert: that is known as the conversion price. BAe ordinary shares were 420p midweek and the convertibles 106p. At 106p, the convertible gets you into the shares at 885p (Pounds 106 / 11.976 = 885p) which represents a conversion premium of 111 per cent over the 420p share price. If the ordinary share price trebles to 1260p by 2007, the preference shares would be convertible into ordinary shares worth 151p, and investors would not want to be repaid at 100p. When should you convert? Ask your broker. There are two points to consider. Income: if the company is successful, the income on the ordinary shares will have risen over the years, whereas that on the convertible is fixed. Normally, you should convert when the income on the shares into which you can convert looks set to exceed that on the convertible: the crossover point. Capital: never convert when there is a large conversion premium. Sell if you must. What happens if the company gets a takeover bid? Check the small print. The take-over panel insists that holders of convertibles should be offered at least as much as they would get if they had converted into shares. But there is no longer a rule that a bidder has to offer fair recompense for the conversion premium. What if you do not convert? There are some horror stories of private investors losing a third of their investment overnight because they failed to convert before their conversion rights expired.</p>

			<p><P> August 23, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LIZ SMITH: ZSA ZSA'S LIGHTS ARE UNDIMMED BY HER TIME IN JAIL  </P> <P> IT WAS Zsa Zsa Gabor herself, in person, at "Grand Hotel" in New York the other  evening. She clapped and carried on, saying how much she loved the Broadway  musical. Then, Zsa Zsa let NBC producer Carl Killingsworth whisk her off after  to dinner at the intimate bistro Tout Va Bien. (No fool Zsa Zsa, she carried  home to her hubby, Prince Frederick Von Anhalt, who hadn't wanted to go out, a  doggie bag of what the French waitresses at Tout call pommes frites.)  </P> <P> Jail doesn't seem to have dimmed Zsa Zsa's lights. She appears none the worse  for her experience, saying: "There were all kinds of women in jail; one big  butch number and another very feminine one. I didn't care for either of them. .  . . You know, in World War II, I went from Budapest to Berlin to Bel-Air with  great success. Maybe what I need is another war."  </P> <P> MAYBE you recall several weeks back when this space reported a split between  those "The Amazing Teddy Z" stars -- Jon Cryer and Jane Sibbett. (They'd been  cozier off screen than they had on.) At that time, Jane phoned from Los Angeles  to say that there wasn't a breakup and that "my mother would be heartbroken if  we split." Her words were so noted here.  </P> <P> But today, I'm worried about Jane's mother because a very single Jon Cryer is  in New York, fresh from negotiating with ABC about a new series. And fresh from  what I hear is a final and definite split with Jane. Tonight, Jon will be at  the official TriBeCa opening of the David Dennis eatery, Les Poulets.  </P> <P> WENT TO a marvelous party at the New York apartment of PR man Peter Brown (he  once helped mastermind the Beatles and also wrote one of the best books ever  about them). Peter poured in honor of his pal Andrew Lloyd Webber and Andrew's  new ladyfriend, Madeleine Gurdon.  </P> <P> A stellar crowd turned out to get a look at the happy couple -- the New York  Times' Punch Sulzberger, Arthur Gelb and Abe Rosenthal; agent Lynn Nesbit;  Vanity Fair's Dominick Dunne and Caroline Graham; Broadway's Barbara and  Charles ("Annie") Strouse; singer Christopher Mason; novelist Shirley Lord, and  country/Western's Larry Gatlin.  </P> <P> The British tabloids have recently noted that Andrew -- the richest and most  prolific man in London and Broadway theater -- has been "done over" by his new  friend. They say Madeleine, an upper-class blonde who pals around with the  Royals and the horsy set, has turned Andrew into "an upright, short-haired,  boyish prince."  </P> <P> Well, hyperbole aside, I've never seen Andrew looking so well, so trim, so  splendid. And Madeleine is a charmer, very bright, and with a good sense of  humor for a person who'd never endured New York before. I hear she gets along  smashingly with Andrew's first wife, Sarah, and with his children. Madeleine  has never met the second Mrs. W. -- Sarah Brightman, who starred in "Phantom"  in London and New York and will now make the movie.  </P> <P> Andrew and Sarah II are getting a divorce and once that's done, I think we can  safely say that Madeleine will become Mrs. A.L.W.  </P></p>

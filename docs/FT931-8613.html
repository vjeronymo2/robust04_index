			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Out of favour with US institutions - Peter John looks at the depressed state of the share prices of UK drug makers UK pharmaceuticals stocks are more than out of favour with the big US institutions. From late last year, when the US began to scent economic recovery and jitters developed over President Clinton's administration plans for health reform, the whole sector has been shunned. With the added pressure on sterling-based stocks of a 30-cent fall in the pound against the dollar since last autumn, UK stocks have become increasingly less popular. The three UK drug companies with significant exposure to the US - Glaxo, Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham - have regularly seen their share prices pick up in the morning in London only to fall back when trading begins on Wall Street. Since the close of trading on November 3, the date of the US presidential election, Glaxo's share price has dropped more than 170p to 662p, Wellcome has fallen almost 100p to 898p and SmithKline A shares have fallen by the same amount to 439p. In contrast, the FT-SE 100 has risen more than 100 points. Although currency shifts cloud the issue the falls in the UK drug stocks have been broadly in line with those of their US counterparts. Over the past three months Glaxo has dropped 26.6 per cent against the S&amp;P Composite index, SmithKline 23.8 per cent and Wellcome 15.4 per cent. Meanwhile, Merck has lost 19.3 per cent, Pfizer 23.8 per cent and Lilly 17.8 per cent. Of the three UK groups, Wellcome generates the highest amount of business in North America but has the lowest exposure to the US stock market. Some 43 per cent of turnover and 49 per cent of profits come from the region although only 6.05 per cent of the company's shares, about 52m, were held in the form of American Depositary Receipts at the last official announcement in December. Subsequently, the stake has fallen by about 2m shares but the company argues that it is not exposed to the threats faced by the industry, particularly the call for price cuts. 'Historically we haven't particularly been reliant on price increases but volume growth,' says Wellcome's Mr Mike Wort. SmithKline has the biggest exposure to the US in share terms, about 27 per cent, and believes that the ADR holding has fallen by about 0.5 per cent, or some 56m shares, over the past three months. The company generates about 40 per cent of sales in the US and is heavily exposed to the managed health care sector which is one of the principal targets for the Clinton reform. It is also the only one among the three companies to manufacture in Puerto Rico. There is a belief that President Clinton will cut back existing tax breaks for companies operating there. Finally SmithKline's main drug, Tagamet, comes off patent next year. The greatest sufferer in share price terms has been Glaxo. The company generates about 38 per cent of sales in the US where, at the last official count in November, 23.8 per cent of its shares were held as ADRs in New York. The company was hesitant of commenting on the falls ahead of today's announcement of full year profits and is avoiding the temptation to jump the gun on the Clinton price reforms. Nevertheless, the political changes in the US only add to worries in some quarters that Glaxo is too much of a one-drug company and until some new products are flushed through the research and development pipeline the shares could remain under presure. However, Mr Jonathan Gelles, of Wertheim Schroder in New York, argues that concerns over Zantac and, indeed, over the group as a whole, are overdone. 'We believe that, at these levels, the sector is basing out very firmly indeed and investors should be taking major positions. The wise man should be buying Glaxo and Wellcome,' he said. An interesting point is that the ADR listings of the three companies do not appear to have changed as greatly as the widespread US selling would indicate. One reason for this is the trickle-down effect of small retail investors picking up stock offloaded by the big institutions. Also, in the UK where the attitude to the sector is more positive, some institutions have been buying via the ADRs.</p>

			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / International Company News: Esab sees profit of SKr300m Esab, the world's leading producer of welding equipment, said yesterday profits were rising faster than anticipated. It forecast income after financial items for 1994 of around SKr300m (Dollars 38m), compared with SKr82m last year. The Swedish group said the improvement stemmed chiefly from cost-cutting and restructuring within the European operations, where the number of employees has fallen by 35 per cent since 1990. Although the European market was said to be 'somewhat weaker' this year, Esab said there was strong growth in North America and Asia. Group sales in the first five months of the year rose modestly, to SKr3.1bn from SKr2.8bn in the same period last year. However, profits after financial items surged to SKr138m from SKr13m. If market trends in Europe and North America continued, and there was no adverse effect from currency reform in Brazil, an important market, full-year profits should be three times the 1993 result.</p>

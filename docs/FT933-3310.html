			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / Ingenuity - The FT Engineering Review (12): Ignore this technology at your peril - Rapid prototyping systems / A new idea that could cost Pounds 400,000 is bound to meet some resistance. But what are the advantages? Could it pay for itself in only a few months and cut time-to-market? JUSTIFYING almost any kind of capital investment has been more than usually difficult for British managers in the recession, and even an investment that can pay for itself in a few months is questioned closely by the board. It is a problem of which manufacturers of rapid prototyping (RP) systems are acutely aware. Not only do they want manufacturers to say yes to what could be a Pounds 400,000-plus investment, they are also trying to sell a new idea, and thus come up against a natural tendency towards conservatism. However, the advantage for RP suppliers is that their product fits perfectly with industry's current concerns to reduce time-to-market and cut down development costs in the interests of greater competitiveness. After all, if it is possible to reduce the time taken to develop a prototype by 80 per cent, then that really is engineering for profit. Time is money. Fortunately, the evidence suggests UK industry is becoming increasingly aware of the benefits of RP after a slow start. Virtually every engineering company worthy of the name has a computer aided design (Cad) system, the starting point for RP, and if it cannot afford an RP system itself, there are RP bureaux ready to offer the service. The aim of RP is to bypass the time-consuming pattern-making or soft tooling that forms the traditional method of making a prototype. A 3D Cad file of a part is converted by software into a series of layers, and then a variety of methods is used to build up a prototype. The market leader, 3D Systems of the US, uses a system called stereography that applies ultraviolet light onto a vat of resin, building a part layer by layer. Another system, from the Israeli-US company Cubital, uses a more complex process called instant slice-curing. Some of the associated technology may be complex, but the idea is easy to understand and 'sexy', says Dr Peter Davies, director of the Advanced Technology Centre, part of the Warwick Manufacturing Group. Whatever the individual merits of different systems, the key point is that building a prototype from as much as 1,500 slices can save weeks, months and thousands of pounds or dollars on the conventional methods. According to 3D, aerospace companies frequently spend Dollars 25,000 or more plus six to nine months to develop a master of a single complex part. A division of a major car manufacturer, it says, may produce thousands of detailed prototypes a year for its car and parts designs. In the UK, perhaps unsurprisingly, the first industrial user of RP was British Aerospace/Rover. Early last year, when most British manufacturers had still not even heard of RP, Rover was able to exhibit prototypes such as manifolds made by RP. At Lucas Aerospace engine systems division, which makes fuel pumps and fuel metering units for military and civil aircraft, RP is part of a major concurrent engineering initiative. The production of full-size stereographic models has resulted in faster 'time to market' and 'right first time' products. The 3D solid model data from the company's computer-aided engineering system, supplied by Structural Dynamics Research Corporation, is turned into a fully detailed replica of the casting. Design review teams, castings suppliers, assembly engineers and the customer use the acrylic model as an invaluable focus for discussions and decision-making, says Lucas. In the US, healthcare companies are using RP to produce models of new products such as medical implants, where up to 80 per cent of the manufacturing costs are incurred in the design phase. Intriguingly, one of the problems encountered by RP suppliers has been that the paybacks often seem too good to be true. Mr Richard Fedchenko, a senior executive at 3D, recalls one instance when company managers found they could achieve a payback on their investment in seven weeks. Realising that the board would never believe this, they said the RP machine would pay for itself in nine months. The other problem for suppliers is that clients know that this is a young industry with fast-changing technology - 3D has only been selling its systems since 1987. So there is a tendency to hang fire and wait for the next technological obstacle to be surmounted - or just for prices to come down, as they have in real terms. Proponents of RP counter that it should not matter to major manufacturers if the RP technology they purchase is superseded within a year or two, because the equipment will already have paid for itself - not only in pure financial terms but in the contribution made to compressed product development times, and hence competitiveness. Still, in the current climate one can hardly blame UK manufacturers for letting others shoulder the burden of investment in the technology. Hence the rise in bureaux offering companies an RP service - there are now about 10 such bureaux in the UK. Rover's advanced rapid prototyping department, located at the Canley site near Coventry, offers a service to outside customers based on the UK's largest operational stereolithography machine. This forms one of the services of a rapid prototyping and tooling consortium formed in March by Rover and the University of Warwick's advanced technology centre. The consortium operates a club to advise members on best RP and rapid tooling practice, and acts as a focal point for research and development. The consortium is helping companies in a broad range of industries from aerospace to consumer goods, and this summer the ATC placed an order for a Helisys LOM 2030 machine, using another RP process called laminated object manufacturing, to further its researches. As vendors and users build up experience of RP and examples of its savings in time and money, the overriding message is that RP is a development that manufacturers ignore at their peril. But Dr Davies believes this is not just because of the benefits of the process for making prototypes. The next step, using the same kind of processes to develop rapid tooling that can be used for an entire production run, is of potentially far greater significance, he says. Virtually every manufactured product needs tooling, but this can often cause the longest delays in the product development process, he says. The combination of rapid prototyping and tooling could reduce the entire time to marketby 70 per cent. The centre at Warwick has already produced tooling for small vehicle panels in two weeks rather than the normal three months, says Dr Davies. But it is also looking at producing rapid tooling for making smaller plastic parts on injection moulding machines. Small wonder, therefore, that the Warwick club includes among its members not only end-users but tooling companies - which can benefit from rapid tooling developments as well as feel threatened by them.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, June 6 (MTI) -- Concerning the  correspondence between Peter Boross and Laszlo Tokes, the  Government Spokesperson's Office sent the following position to  MTI:    ``The government of the Republic of Hungary believes that  one  of the most important aims of the recently-launched process is  the adoption of practical measures in East-Central Europe that  will bring genuine improvement in the position of national  minorities living here.    ``The purpose of the series of negotiations is to help  strengthen political and legal commitments, which -- when met --  will increase the region's stability and improve cooperation  between states.    ``This would benefit both the concerned minorities and the  broader community.    ``The initiative of the European Union is intended to set  off  a process, in which two neighbouring countries will hold  bilateral talks with EU presence and mediation, and subsequently  conclude good-neighbourly agreements with knowledge and in  consideration of minority interests and opinions.    ``Start of a continuous dialogue between the concerned  minority and the government with EU mediation towards settling  questions of dispute by mutually satisfactory agreements is a  key factor of these talks.    ``Although the Hungarian Government cannot formally  represent  ethnic Hungarian citizens of other countries, it considers it  indispensable for representatives of the concerned minorities to  be able to express their views and comment on the agreements  reached during the process.    ``This is equally in the interests of minorities,  governments  and all conference participants, since lasting stability can  only be ensured by accords accepted by the minorities as well.    "Hungary is ready to discuss the above issues on a bilateral  basis within the framework of the process, and welcomes EU's  active participation and its willingness to provide moderator's  assistance to the concerned parties in every phase of the  negotiations."</p>

			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / Survey of Shanghai (6): Where profits rose 55-fold / Profile of A UK-Chinese partnership The Shanghai Foxboro Company Limited (SFCL) is, to all appearances, a modest little enterprise in a Shanghai suburb. Its offices and factory are neat and modish, at least by Chinese standards. Its sales of Yuan 107m are in western terms hardly spectacular. But SFCL is, by all accounts, one of the most successful joint ventures in China. The company was set up just 10 years ago. In that time, its sales have multiplied 66-fold, its profits 55-fold. The western partner, the UK engineering group Siebe, describes it as 'a super business'. Since Siebe is among the faster-growing companies in Britain, this suggests SFCL's performance stands up to western scrutiny. It is a further measure of its success that the local management are prepared to talk candidly about the problems the venture faced at the outset, not all of which have been wholly overcome. Foxboro of the US, the Siebe subsidiary which set up the joint venture, makes systems which control the production process in big, basic industries such as oil, petrochemicals and power generation. It is thus tied to the phenomenal growth of the Chinese economy. The point has not been lost on its western competitors such as Honeywell and Rosemount, which have entered the market in force. But SFCL has hung on to some 15 per cent of the market, and is claimed by both partners to be solidly profitable. If all this sounds conventional, the proposition is less simple at closer range. The basic idea behind the venture, as with most of its kind, is that the western partner provides the product and the technology, the Chinese the market and low-cost manufacture. But for a sophisticated and long-standing venture such as SFCL, more is required. The company has to embrace not just western technology, but western techniques of management. It is Foxboro's job to supply them. Just how this works in practice is not easy for the outsider to define. Although Foxboro might seem in principle to hold all the cards, it owns only 49 per cent of the equity. The Chinese government is the senior partner, and runs it that way. The working language of the company is Chinese. The two men in charge of the business - Mr Wang Zhenfeng, general manager, and Mr Edward Haderer, his deputy - have no common language, and communicate through an interpreter. Along with the chief engineer, Mr Haderer is one of only two non-Chinese in the 450-strong workforce. 'When it comes to a lot of the day-to-day operations', Mr Haderer says, 'Mr Wang Zhenfeng takes care of things completely independently of me. But when an issue occurs which could require interpretation or decision-making between the two partners, I call him in, and he does the same. We're both involved very closely in things like budget-setting and expenses.' All the same, it is clear that progress to western-style management has some way to go. While profitability is excellent, Mr Haderer says, 'some of the other figures look rougher'. Take, for example, the level of inventory. 'At one time', he says, 'inventory was to a Chinese company like money in the bank. You bought as much as you could get hold of. That was hard to turn round, though we're making progress.' Part of the problem, Mr Wang Zhenfeng adds, has to do with suppliers. 'We may work on small quantities, but the suppliers have minimum quantity levels. We may only want 200 of a certain kind of resistor a year, and the minimum supply is 1,000.' All this is characteristic of a command economy, and will doubtless right itself as the move to a market economy proceeds. In the meantime, FSCL has to carry stock levels roughly twice those of Foxboro operations elsewhere in the world. Another cultural problem from the early days is recalled by Mr Donald Sorterup, Mr Haderer's predecessor, now vice-president of international operations. 'At the outset, the Chinese staff had a tremendous fear of taking on responsibility. When it came to repairing a computer, they'd have the technological knowledge to realise the circuit board in question was worth Dollars 10,000. That was so far out of their reckoning that they'd be terrified of getting it wrong. It took us a while to convince them they wouldn't go to jail.' Since then, Mr Haderer says, things have got better. All the same, he remarks, 'as a western manager, I'm sometimes surprised by the amount of energy focused on seeing whether responsibility can be taken on by somebody else'. Another issue which has to be continuously addressed, he says, is quality. This might seem odd for a company which was the first in China to win the coveted ISO9001 international quality standard. But the concept of quality, Mr Haderer says, is not really in the Chinese culture. 'During the years of the planned economy, the issue was to complete quotas. The important thing was to deliver your 100 widgets in the month. If it was 105, so much the better. If when you shipped them they didn't work too well, that wasn't so important.' On the other hand, he says, that is changing with the market economy. 'When I see a Chinese customer now looking at a blouse or a teapot in a store, they're looking at it closer than I would.' And if certain aspects of the business are still proving difficult, on one thing at least the western partner is clear: the quality of the Chinese technical staff. Of SFCL's 450 employees, 167 are graduates, 23 of them with higher degrees. Mr Barrie Stephens, Siebe's chairman - himself a graduate engineer - says: 'They're absolutely spiffing. And the labour rates are cockeyed. They're working for nothing. The average salary we're paying is 1,000 Yuan per month, which is Dollars 200.' For Mr Stephens - who, with the rest of his board, was in Shanghai to celebrate the company's 10th anniversary last month - what counts is not merely profits but dividends. 'For the first five years, we were pouring money into a black hole. It's only in the last couple of years we've had any cash out at all. But it's an astonishingly liberal policy on dividends. We get all ours out in cash - 49 per cent of the profits: and while the China-US tax treaty allows for 10 per cent withholding tax, we don't pay any.' The lesson he draws is a familiar but cautionary one. 'If you're going to go to China, you've got to be a long-term player. It's no good looking for a quick buck. It doesn't exist.'</p>

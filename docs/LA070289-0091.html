			<p><P> July 2, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD;  </P> <P> IRELAND TALKS BREAK DOWN  </P> <P> Talks on forming a new Irish government broke down when the center-right  Progressive Democrats insisted on a coalition with caretaker Prime Minister  Charles Haughey. Haughey, forced to resign Thursday after a snap election that  left his Fianna Fail party worse off than before, has ruled out any coalition,  suggesting a looser linkup instead. On Friday, he put out feelers to the  Progressive Democrats, who have the six seats needed to give him an overall  majority, saying he wanted a "policy-based arrangement" with them. But the  Progressive Democrats, formed three years ago by Haughey dissidents, held out  for a coalition.  </P></p>

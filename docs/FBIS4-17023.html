			<p>BFN     [Text] A Crimean declaration -- accord for revival -- was  signed by a number of political parties operating on the  peninsula in Simferopol. Our reporter Anatolyy Polonskyy  comments on this issue.    [Polonskyy] Representatives of the mass media were asked to  cover the declaration signing ceremony. My personal viewpoint  is that the authors of this document wished to demonstrate the  importance and significance of their work, which had been  carried out by them in the name of the interparty and  interethnic accord, which is the basis of the course aimed at  the socioeconomic revival of the Crimea. Of course, the signing  of the declaration was called an event of historical importance.  Certainly, to leave the economic crisis, to be revived, the  Crimea today requires peace and accord. We cannot help but to  agree with the majority of the declaration's provisions. Who  can oppose the provision stating that the principle of creation  and not destruction should be the basis for practical  activities, or that interparty relations should be based not on  our differences but on similarities? However, this declaration  remains a declaration if one says one thing but does the  opposite.    In the Crimea, all the political forces favor peace and  accord, no party calls for violating laws, and they all support  the inviolable friendship among the Crimean peoples. How can  the existence of [words indistinct] openly anti-Ukrainian  slogans and appeals on the square in front of the legislature  and the residence of the president be explained? These slogans  and appeals are so insulting to the national Ukrainian dignity  [words indistinct], said Oleksandr Fedorenko, representative of  the Crimean section of the Ukrainian Republican Party, that he  could not bring himself to sign this declaration. The actions  on the square are supporting President Yuriy Meshkov, Oleksandr  Fedorenko said. The question arises whether the president  indulges the organizers of this action or whether this is just  his policy. The more [words indistinct] near the president's  residence, the fewer tourists (?will come) to the Crimea,  representative of the Democratic Party of the Crimea Mykhaylo  (Mareyev) added in support of Fedorenko.    Really, [words indistinct] to go to rest in the Crimea where  interethnic hostility is flaring up near the legislature. Given  this situation, can the declaration on some sort of accord be  signed? At first, this accord should be reached and only later  -- reported on. This is the reason why in addition to the  Crimean section of the Ukrainian Republican Party, the  declaration was not signed by the Crimean Civil Congress. The  signature of the Crimean Tatars mejlis is also absent under the  text of the declaration. Its representative was present in the  assembly hall as an observer. The Communist Party of the Crimea  refused even to observe this ceremony. So, was it really worth  [words indistinct] with the signing of the declaration when  there is no actual interparty and interethnic accord?</p>

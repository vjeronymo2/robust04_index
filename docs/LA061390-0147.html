			<p><P> June 13, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> PANEL PUSHES FLAG AMENDMENT TOWARD FLOOR, ADVISES REJECTION  </P> <P> A divided House subcommittee pushed a constitutional amendment against flag  desecration toward the House floor today with a recommendation that it be  rejected.  </P> <P> The Civil and Constitutional Rights Subcommittee of the House Judiciary  Committee, a panel dominated by five veteran Democratic liberals, voted 5 to 3  to tell the full committee that the brief amendment should be rejected.  </P> <P> The full committee next Tuesday is expected to send the amendment out to the  House floor for a vote that could come late next week. Subcommittee Chairman  Don Edwards (D-San Jose) predicted a close vote.  </P> <P> Immediately after voting to report the amendment to the full committee  "adversely," the committee voted 6 to 2 for a resolution condemning flag  burning and reaffirming the values protected by the Bill of Rights, a proposal  senior panel Republican James Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin labeled as a "patent  attempt to provide political cover for people who for one reason or another  oppose the constitutional amendment."  </P></p>

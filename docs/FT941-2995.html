			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / Brazil will tackle debt restructuring without IMF Brazil told leading bank creditors yesterday it intends to try to complete its Dollars 52bn commercial debt restructuring by an April 15 deadline rather than wait for formal support from the International Monetary Fund, which is not expected until later this year. Mr Paulo Tarso Flecha de Lima, Brazil's ambassador in Washington, confirmed his country was seeking to complete the deal without the IMF. 'It will be difficult but not impossible. We're confident,' he said. The initiative follows the IMF's refusal on Wednesday to grant Brazil a standby loan until its planned anti-inflation reforms are in place. If the country's bank creditors agree to go ahead, Brazil would be the first large country to launch a Brady-type debt restructuring without the backing of an IMF standby loan. Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, finance minister, held talks yesterday with Mr William Rhodes, vice chairman of Citibank, closing agents for the deal, to discuss going ahead without the IMF. Brazil is running out of time and must give notification by tonight that the April 15 deadline will be met and old debt swapped for new. This deadline has already been extended and bankers said it could be stretched further. Before Brazil can give notification, the banks need to agree a waiver of the restructuring's original requirement for IMF backing. Leading banks met yesterday to discuss a waiver, which was described as 'do-able' by one banker. Mr Rhodes said a decision on the waiver would be ready this afternoon. Brazil also needs to find an acceptable guarantee for the deal. Originally the US Treasury was set to issue up to Dollars 21.5bn of zero coupon bonds as part of a guarantee once the IMF standby was secured. It is unclear if enough bonds are available. Going ahead with the restructuring without the IMF would make the deal more expensive and risky. It also would deprive Mr Cardoso, a potential presidential candidate, of the kudos of IMF backing. Mr Cardoso had hoped to persuade the IMF to agree a letter of intent for the stand-by loan during meetings on Wednesday. Although the IMF was supportive, it did not commit itself to granting the stand-by. It is thought to have insisted Brazil ran a budget surplus this year but Brazil was only prepared to offer a balanced budget. The IMF has also grown wary of Brazil, which has signed but failed to deliver on eight letters of intent and two stand-by agreements in the last 12 years. Brazil's decision to go ahead without the IMF maybe seen as a snub, but the country is in an unusual position. It has foreign reserves of more than Dollars 30bn and IMF support would have been largely symbolic. Success for Mr Cardoso's domestic reforms, mainly designed to tackle annual inflation of about 2,500 per cent, is seen as more important for his presidential ambitions. But Mr Cardoso also wanted the IMF letter and a smooth conclusion to the bank deal. According to finance ministry officials, he will now use the IMF's supportive comments as 'the best possible endorsement' given that the economic reform programme is still unproven.</p>

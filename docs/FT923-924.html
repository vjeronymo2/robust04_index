			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / Barings cuts jobs in effort to stem losses BARINGS, the privately controlled UK merchant banking group, yesterday shed 108 employees at its securities trading subsidiary, Baring Securities, in an attempt to stem heavy losses. It also reorganised the senior management of Baring Securities, which made losses of between Pounds 10m and Pounds 20m in the six months to June 30, according to Mr Andrew Tuckey, Barings' deputy chairman. An executive in Barings' merchant banking operations, Mr Peter Norris, is becoming chief operating officer of Baring Securities. The losses were responsible for a fall in Barings' group pre-tax profits from Pounds 24.3m to Pounds 11.8m in the six months to June 30. Mr Tuckey said he was particularly pleased with the way in which the group was working with Dillon Read, the Wall Street investment bank in which Barings acquired a 40 per cent interest late last year. Baring Securities, set up in 1984, was for many years one of the UK's most profitable international securities trading firms, winning The Queen's Award for Export. Its founder, Mr Christopher Heath, became one of the UK's highest paid executives. Mr Tuckey said Baring Securities, with 1,260 employees, had become too big for Mr Heath to have sole responsibility for day-to-day management. So Mr Heath is giving up his title of managing director to become chairman of Baring Securities, concentrating on developing new business and seeing clients. The losses fell in Baring Securities Japanese and continental European operations. However, extensive operations in other parts of south-east Asia and Latin America are trading profitably. More than half the redundancies are in the London headquarters. There were also 15 departures from the Tokyo office and 13 from the Frankfurt office, which is being closed. Barings is reorganising its European operations to concentrate on southern European markets, where it believes its research is superior to rivals'. The reorganisation has made some of its office space redundant. In the second half of the year, Barings will therefore take a charge of Pounds 10m to cover the cost of lay-offs and the surplus property. Profits of Barings' corporate finance, banking and capital markets operations were almost unchanged in the first half. However there was a fall in profits at its fund management subsidiary.</p>

			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / Delors urges 'reasonable limits' on EU harmonisation of labour laws Harmonisation of employment laws in the European Union must 'remain within reasonable limits', Mr Jacques Delors said in London yesterday, David Goodhart writes. Mr Delors, retiring president of the European Commission, said at a Trades Union Congress meeting that EU-level rights must not become an obstacle for less developed countries. Mr Delors, a former union leader in France, stressed that it was important to respect national diversity. He also warned that unions had often failed to stay in touch with their members' aspirations and needed to restrain wage demands.</p>

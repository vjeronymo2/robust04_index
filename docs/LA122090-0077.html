			<p><P> December 20, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TIMES HONORS TOP COACH, LINEMAN, BACK  </P> <P> After his football team lost its season opener to Rosemead, 30-7, in September,  said Coach Tony Zane of Baldwin Park High, his biggest concern was not how many  games the Braves would win.  </P> <P> It was whether they would win any games this season.  </P> <P> Fortunately for Zane and the Braves, the prospects improved considerably after  the loss to Rosemead.  </P> <P> Baldwin Park wound up finishing the regular season on a roll, going 7-1-1 the  rest of the way and losing only to undefeated Sierra League champion Nogales.  </P> <P> The Braves made even more strides in the CIF Division IV playoffs, upsetting  previously undefeated Canyon Springs and Santa Margarita on the way to their  first berth in a Southern Section championship game since they reached the  Southeastern Conference final in 1984.  </P> <P> In the title game, Baldwin Park suffered a 10-6 defeat to Arlington, but it was  still a remarkable season for the Braves -- the only 11-man team in the San  Gabriel Valley to reach the Southern Section finals.  </P> <P> So it should come as little surprise that Zane has been honored as the Los  Angeles Times Coach of the Year in the valley.  </P> <P> In his third year as coach of the Braves, Zane guided his squad to a 10-3-1  record. He also improved his overall record to 23-10-2.  </P> <P> Zane had been offensive coordinator at Baldwin Park for 17 years under longtime  Coach Ty Pagone. When Pagone retired after the 1987 season, Zane was named his  successor and has followed in the school's winning tradition.  </P> <P> At The Times' high school football awards breakfast last Sunday at the Anaheim  Hilton &amp; Towers, Zane was honored along with two athletes. Sedrick Thomas  of Muir was named Back of the Year and Jason Patterson of Bishop Amat Lineman  of the Year. All received trophies provided by the Los Angeles Times Fund.  </P> <P> It would be difficult to find two players in the valley this season who  displayed more versatility than Thomas and Patterson.  </P> <P> The 6-foot, 210-pound Thomas distinguished himself as a passer and rusher and  also handled punting chores for the Mustangs.  </P> <P> A senior, Thomas made his biggest impression as a passer, completing 87 of 132  passes -- an outstanding 65.9% -- for 1,991 yards and 19 touchdowns, with only  five interceptions.  </P> <P> Thomas also took advantage of his 4.5-second speed in the 40-yard dash to rush  for 740 yards and four touchdowns. He averaged 38.6 yards per kick as the  team's punter after spending his junior season as a starter at linebacker and  part-time starter at quarterback.  </P> <P> A two-time All-Pacific League selection who led the Mustangs to an 8-4 record  and the Division II quarterfinals, Thomas is regarded as one of the top college  prospects in the valley. His recruiting list includes NCAA Division I programs  such as Colorado, USC, UCLA, UC Berkeley, Oklahoma and Washington.  </P> <P> Patterson has not received nearly as much attention from Division I schools,  but he was every bit as important to the fortunes of Bishop Amat, which won its  sixth consecutive Angelus League title en route to a 9-2 record and a spot in  the Division I quarterfinals.  </P> <P> Also a 6-0, 210-pound senior, Patterson was crucial to Bishop Amat's success on  offense and defense.  </P> <P> As a defensive end and linebacker, Patterson paced the valley in quarterback  sacks with 18. He led the team with 18 blocked passes and also caused two  fumbles, recovered two others and posted 45 tackles.  </P> <P> Patterson was also one of the team's most consistent players on offense. At  fullback, he rushed for 761 yards and 10 touchdowns in 134 carries and caught  22 passes for 307 yards and a touchdown.  </P> <P> Patterson was named the most valuable player of the powerful Angelus League,  where he made the all-league first team two years in a row.  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEMANDS ON PROPOSALS FLEXIBLE, SHAMIR SAYS  </P> <P> In the uneasy days before his meeting with President Bush, Prime Minister  Yitzhak Shamir says he is willing to consider Middle East peace proposals from  Washington that fall short of Israel's demands -- but not to give in to talks  with the Palestine Liberation Organization.  </P> <P> Last Sunday, Israel made several key demands of the United States as a  condition for acceptance of a five-point peace plan from Secretary of State  James A. Baker III. The plan is designed to get Israeli-Palestinian talks under  way.  </P> <P> "I don't know what will be the proposals (from Baker)," Shamir said in an  interview. "Maybe he will accept all our proposals. And if there will be some  other proposals of the secretary, I think it will have to be considered by our  Cabinet."  </P> <P> Shamir declined to specify which conditions he might be willing to give up --  his government also wants to narrow the scope of the talks to details for  holding Palestinian elections -- but the combative prime minister expressed  confidence that Washington "will not bring the PLO to the negotiating table  against our will."  </P> <P> This week's Bush-Shamir talks -- they will meet Wednesday at the White House --  have been the subject of strained diplomatic give-and-take. Bush withheld the  invitation on the grounds that he needed assurances bilateral talks would be  positive. In Israel, the delay was viewed as implied criticism of Shamir's  unwillingness to accept Baker's peace plan without conditions and a foretaste  of a rough ride in Washington.  </P> <P> Shamir himself declined to discuss the handling of the invitation. "I'm not  ready to comment," he said tersely. The United States is itself negotiating  with the PLO, and those talks have become the main sore point between Jerusalem  and Washington. Shamir asserted that the Washington-PLO talks make it  impossible for Israel to find independent peace partners.  </P> <P> "It doesn't help," Shamir said. "I think that this dialogue strengthens the  PLO. It discourages people who have other views to be more outspoken to do  something for peace."  </P> <P> Shamir bases his opposition to talks with the PLO on its demand for an  independent state. "It's not a matter of a capricious mind," he said. "The  reason is very simple. . . . If we would agree to talk to the PLO, it will  express our readiness to negotiate about a Palestinian state."  </P> <P> Israel and the United States also disagree on the framework for a final peace  solution, Shamir added. Washington believes that Israel should give up at least  some of the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.  </P> <P> Shamir hopes the subject will not come up in Washington. "I think these  differences are not relevant now because the advantage of the peace process is  to give the parties the possibility to negotiate in a gradual way about  advancing toward peace (while) having different views, different positions  about the ultimate goal," he said.  </P> <P> In a rare admission, Shamir said he does not think that the Israeli army can  fully repress the Arab uprising in the occupied lands.  </P> <P> "We have some difficulties, of course, in handling this problem," Shamir said.  "And the main difficulty of ours is . . . we are not ready, for moral reasons,  to use all the necessary force to put an end to these violent manifestations."  </P></p>

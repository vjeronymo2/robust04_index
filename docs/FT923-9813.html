			<p>920803 FT  03 AUG 92 / International Company News: Credit Lyonnais to lead manage Ecu500m loan THE European Community has awarded Credit Lyonnais of France the mandate to lead manage a Ecu500m (Dollars 363m) three-year loan, marking the first time the EC has tapped the international syndicated-loans market in a decade. The EC has agreed to pay a margin of 3.125 basis points - that is 1/32 of a percentage point - over the London interbank offered rate (Libor), with participation fees of 10 basis points. Although the terms appear tight, the EC is able to borrow at very low margins in the international loans market.</p>

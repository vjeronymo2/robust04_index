			<p><P> February 10, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRANIFF PLANS TO MOVE MAIN OFFICE TO ORLANDO  </P> <P> Braniff Inc. announced Thursday that it will move its headquarters to Orlando  from Dallas and expand support facilities in Orlando and in Kansas City to the  tune of $40 million and 1,400 jobs in the next year.  </P> <P> Kansas City will remain the airline's primary hub, Braniff Chairman William G.  McGee told a news conference in Orlando. But the carrier wants to participate  "in one of the most dynamic growth areas of the country" by moving its  corporate base to Orlando.  </P> <P> The airline, which began operating in central Florida a year ago with the  acquisition of Florida Express, will build new maintenance facilities at both  Kansas City and Orlando as well as a headquarters building in Orlando, McGee  said.  </P> <P> "This aggressive expansion program coupled with our already announced plans to  increase our fleet by a net of 22 additional aircraft this year will fuel a 35%  companywide growth in employment over the next 12 months," McGee said.  </P></p>

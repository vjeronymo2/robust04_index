			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Rebel EFG holders defeated over chief ATTEMPTS BY several shareholders of EFG, which has interests in forestry and home and leisure products, to remove Mr Alan Joynes as chief executive was defeated for the second time at an EGM last week, writes Michiyo Nakamoto. Management and certain shareholders of EFG have been locked in a battle over the company's future since directors announced their intention to dispose of the core forestry business and concentrate instead on garden leisure products. EFG also warned that difficult trading conditions and high interest costs, together with exceptional and extraordinary charges and provisions, were expected to result in a loss of some Pounds 2.2m for the first half. It added, however, that a reduction in borrowings and costs had placed it in a better financial position to withstand the recession. In the year to September 30, EFG reported pre-tax losses of Pounds 84,000, compared with a profit of Pounds 2.01m previously, as high interest charges on borrowings of over Pounds 9m took their toll. The final dividend was passed. A second resolution seeking to declare the payment of a dividend was, by consensus, not put to the meeting.</p>

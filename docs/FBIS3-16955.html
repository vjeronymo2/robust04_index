			<p>Language: <F P=105> Latvian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Liga Laizane: "Air Force Is Moving To a </F> Permanent Base"]    [Text] Riga, 11 Mar -- The Latvian Air Force must leave  Spilve airport and move to a permanent base, and the Latvian  Government should seek to provide at least the minimal material  means to enable the Air Force to accomplish its tasks, Prime  Minister Valdis Birkavs stated today. The prime minister's  remarks came after his visit to the present location of the  Latvian Air and Antiaircraft Forces at the dilapidated Spilve  airport. The permanent base, as envisaged when the Air Force  was created, will be at Lielvarde.    Presently, the situation in the Air Force is critical  because, of their two L-410 airplanes, one is undergoing repair  while the other, due to a lack of money, is still waiting its  turn to be repaired. In addition, out of six helicopters, only  one is reported to be in active service.    As was established in the concept of airspace control  recently accepted by the National Security Council, Latvia's  airspace is to be controlled by the Civil Service with the  cooperation of military specialists. Air Force Commander Karlis  Kins explained to V. Birkavs that it would be essential to  create one or two posts for military specialists in the Civil  Airspace Control Services in Riga and Liepaja. However,  aircraft which pass through our airspace should not only be  tracked by radar, but also, in cases of an emergency,  manipulated [manipulacijas]. To accomplish this, fighter planes  are needed. The small Czech-manufactured L-39 fighter would be  optimal in technical as well as financial terms. V. Birkavs said  that the government has agreed to purchase two Mi-8 helicopters,  but at the present time there is no money available.    K. Kins expressed his anxiety over the fact that factors of  state security have not been taken into account in the  telecommunication system created by "Lattelecom." While working  on the project, consultations with military specialists were not  carried out. V. Birkavs agreed that these factors should be  included in the project.</p>

			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Electricity dividends Sir, Michael Smith reported ('Power regulator defends his record', December 1) my comment that regional electricity companies could raise dividends by 6 to 9 per cent annually in the next few years. Taken out of context, this is misleading. I was commenting on the distribution price control proposals which I put forward in the summer, and on the predictions of some analysts that the RECs would be able to increase dividends significantly over the next five years. Some people have said that these predictions mean that the price control is not tight enough. I argued, however,that future dividends will be influenced by profits from businesses other than distribution, as well as by the potential for companies to reduce dividend cover and to draw down cash surpluses which derive from profits under the existing control. In broad terms, these factors could by themselves sustain real dividend growth of 6 to 9 per cent per year. This was not a prediction of future dividends. Decisions on dividends are, of course, entirely for the companies themselves. S C Littlechild, director-general of electricity supply, Office of Electricity Regulation, Edgbaston, Birmingham</p>

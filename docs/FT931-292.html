			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / Schlesinger warns on Emu shortcuts MONETARY union between France and Germany could damage German trade and would not save the European Community's plans for full-scale economic and monetary union (Emu), Mr Helmut Schlesinger, president of the Bundesbank, warned yesterday. In other countries which had striven for years to maintain stability, such a step would be seen as discriminatory, he said in Budapest. Exclusion would affect countries with which Germany had a significant volume of trade in goods and services, he added. Mr Schlesinger has often warned against any variants on the Emu project foreseen in the Maastricht treaties. But yesterday's statement was the clearest condemnation so far of the notion that France and Germany should establish a bilateral union in an attempt to save something from the increasingly troubled Emu project. It also contained his first caution about possible economic damage to Germany. Coming so close on the heels of the change of government in Paris, the speech appeared to be aimed at pre-empting any rehabilitation of the idea of a two-country collaboration fostered in the past by President Francois Mitterrand and Chancellor Helmut Kohl. 'I consider the argument that there could be in Europe a league A and a league B to be invalid,' he said. 'First of all the 'elimination game' is not taking place now but in 1996 or 1998. Second, no country may be excluded for ever: in the end all are able to join the A league.' Even so, he stressed, there was no room for indulgence. It was important for all would-be Emu members to stick strictly to all the economic convergence criteria. On current conditions in Germany, Mr Schlesinger said a shift to stable conditions was detectable, although it was not immediate and not overall. Meanwhile, Mr Helmut Hesse, a member of the Bundesbank's policy-making central council, said he saw little room for manoeuvre on long-term interest rates, and suggested that short-term rates, including the discount rate, would fall only in small steps. Inflation in west Germany, currently 4.3 per cent, would fall during the year to an annual average of 3.5 per cent.</p>

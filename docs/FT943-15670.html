			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / Nigerian army acts on oil strike Nigeria's military government used troops to limit the effect of an oil workers' strike on supplies of fuel in the main cities yesterday, as the industry prepared for the stoppage to intensify. The strike is in protest against the annulment of last year's presidential poll and the arrest two weeks ago of its deposed winner, Mr Moshood Abiola. Mr Abiola has been charged with treason after declaring himself president and is in police custody waiting for a plea for bail to be heard on July 14. The government said yesterday it had made 'special arrangements' to ensure supplies of petroleum products reached filling stations in Lagos and four other southern cities - Ibadan, Engugu, Benin and Port Harcourt - after this week's strike by Nupeng, the blue-collar oil workers' union, left most filling stations dry. It also said that the army would be providing help to ease the fuel shortage and that three military barracks in Lagos were selling fuel directly to the public. In line with a tough stand it has recently taken against civilian opponents, the government said that strikers who disrupted these measures would be regarded as saboteurs. The low official price of petrol in Nigeria, equivalent to some 2p a litre, has led to smuggling abroad of refined products. Military officers have been accused of taking part in the trade. The oil producing companies have maintained normal output of crude despite the strike by Nupeng, but the senior staff association Pengassan has now warned it will go on strike by July 12 unless the government agrees to 'resolve urgently the political crisis' by upholding the result of the presidential election as well as clearing all outstanding debts to joint venture partners, estimated at Dollars 700m (Pounds 461m). Pengassan blames recent job losses in the energy sector on the government's failure to fund its 60 per cent share of the joint ventures. 'Between December and May, 3,000 members or 20 per cent of our membership have lost their jobs due to redundancies by oil service and exploration companies. These are engineers and technicians formerly employed in seismic testing, drilling and maintenance services,' an official said this week.</p>

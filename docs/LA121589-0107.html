			<p><P> December 15, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DODGERS MAY GET LEFT OUT;  </P> <P> BASEBALL: TUDOR SIGNS ONE-YEAR CONTRACT WITH THE CARDINALS. MEANWHILE, THE A'S  TALK WITH VALENZUELA.  </P> <P> Amid an off-season that is looking strangely like last summer, the Dodgers lost  free agent pitcher John Tudor Thursday and could be losing free agent pitcher  Fernando Valenzuela.  </P> <P> Tudor, deciding he needed to pitch more than three times a month as he did in  September, turned down a competitive Dodger offer and signed a one-year deal  with the St. Louis Cardinals. At the same time, sources said Valenzuela is  within days of signing with another team, the leading candidate being the  Oakland Athletics.  </P> <P> "Yes, we have talked to Valenzuela," an Oakland source confirmed. "There won't  be anything tomorrow, but I can't say about two or three days from now."  </P> <P> Dodger sources say Valenzuela was heavily wooed by the New York Yankees last  weekend, but, contrary to media speculation, the Yankees dropped from the  picture earlier this week.  </P> <P> In a statement issued Thursday, Yankee Vice President George Bradley said, "The  Yankees have never been interested in Valenzuela nor have we had any  conversations with Fernando or his agent."  </P> <P> Oakland appears a likely choice because the A's were one of the finalists in  the Tudor sweepstakes, and are in need of a solid left-hander to join Dave  Stewart, Mike Moore and Bob Welch in the defending world champions' rotation.  They are hurting from the loss of right-hander Storm Davis, who recently took  his 31 starts to Kansas City, although they did sign right-hander Scott  Sanderson Wednesday.  </P> <P> Despite an improved Dodger offer last week, the Dodgers and their former Cy  Young Award winner remain far apart. They have offered Valenzuela a two-year  deal of about $1.7 million per year, a pay cut from Valenzuela's $1.85-million  salary of last season. That offer is about $3 million less than Valenzuela's  demand of three years at nearly $6.5 million.  </P> <P> The Dodgers have also offered Valenzuela arbitration, which he must accept by  next Tuesday. But Valenzuela's lawyer, Dick Moss, implied he would not accept  that offer, meaning if the club can't sign him by Jan. 8, he cannot re-sign  with the Dodgers until May 1.  </P> <P> Moss and Valenzuela's agent, Tony DeMarco, refused comment Thursday, but  earlier this week Moss dropped hints.  </P> <P> "The Dodgers have been trying to create a climate where it's all set up for  Fernando to sign," Moss said. "That is not true, and if there's any further  doubt about that, we could erase it on Dec. 19."  </P> <P> Moss added: "People should realize the seriousness of what is happening here.  The Dodgers have offered to substantially cut Fernando's salary for two years.  That's not a good way to treat him."  </P> <P> Dodger Executive Vice President Fred Claire, currently in Hawaii combining  business with a rare vacation, would not comment on reports of Valenzuela's  imminent departure.  </P> <P> "I recognize the situation as it is," Claire said. "Fernando is out there for  all teams to approach. The only thing I will say is, we still have an interest,  and we've expressed that interest."  </P> <P> Their interest in Tudor apparently came too late. Tudor, who was acquired by  the Dodgers from St. Louis for Pedro Guerrero on Aug. 17, 1988, signed a  one-year deal with his former team for a guaranteed $350,000 plus around  $900,000 in incentives based upon the condition of his bothersome left  shoulder.  </P> <P> Claire confirmed that the Dodgers recently made a similar offer. But sources  say Tudor turned it down because, after he was activated Sept. 2, he only made  three relief appearances the remainder of the season.  </P> <P> "John signed with the Cardinals because of his level of comfort with Whitey  (Manager Herzog) and (pitching coach Mike) Roarke," Tudor's agent, Steve  Freyer, said. "He doesn't want this interpreted as a slam to the Dodgers."  </P> <P> But, Freyer admitted, "had John been able to pitch in September, it would have  been most beneficial to John and the Dodgers."  </P> <P> Whether Tudor's loss turns the Guerrero trade into a Dodger black eye depends  on what statistics you read. Guerrero had an MVP-type season for the Cardinals  last summer, batting .311 with 117 runs batted in, but Tudor had helped the  Dodgers to their 1988 World Series championship by going 4-3 with a 2.41  earned-run average in nine starts. He departed Game 3 of the 1988 World Series  against Oakland after just 1 1/3 innings with a bad shoulder, and did not pitch  for the Dodgers again until last June 27.  </P> <P> Dodger interest in Tudor waned after he went back on the disabled list July 8,  and when he was ready to attempt another comeback in September, the Dodgers  weren't ready for him. At one point during September, he even asked the team  for his release, and was refused. He finished the year 0-0 with a 3.14 ERA in  14 1/3 innings. When he turned down the Dodgers' offer to pitch in the Arizona  Instructional League after the season, it was assumed he would not rejoin the  team.  </P> <P> But as the Valenzuela negotiations broke down, the Tudor talks heated up, and  he was even offered arbitration to stay with the club.  </P> <P> "The Dodgers made every effort to sign him," Freyer said. "We had very good  conversations. They tried. This was not a slam dunk for the Cardinals by any  means.  </P> <P> "But John just has a strong, strong relationship with St. Louis."  </P> <P> Said Claire: "We certainly gave John every consideration as far as  opportunities and support are concerned. We took every step to get him back."  </P></p>

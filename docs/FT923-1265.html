			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / Labour split on Europe is staved off LABOUR yesterday managed to avoid an open frontbench split over Europe before today's critical Commons debate on the government's economic policy. The party's ruling national executive committee rejected a referendum on Maastricht, but many in the party believe that a showdown between Mr Bryan Gould, shadow heritage secretary and a leading Labour Euro-sceptic, and Mr John Smith, party leader, has been postponed rather than averted. Mr Gould abstained in the NEC vote which approved by 24-2 a new policy statement about economic and political co-operation in Europe. Earlier in the meeting he joined Mr Tony Benn in supporting unsuccessfully a call from Mr Dennis Skinner for a referendum on the Maastricht treaty and the UK's withdrawal from the European exchange rate mechanism. The leadership's uncompromising stance was seen in the rejection, by 22 votes to six, of a proposal from Mr David Blunkett - who ran Mr Gould's failed campaign for the Labour leadership - that the party leave itself some leeway on holding a referendum. At a separate meeting later, however, five of the 20-plus shadow cabinet members expressed at least some sympathy with the idea of a referendum. The policy statement agreed yesterday confirms Labour's support for 'a managed system of fixed but adjustable exchange rates, agreed through international co-operation', and calls for stronger European action to reduce currency speculation. The paper also reaffirms the party's commitment to the UK's being at the heart of Europe, pledging that Labour 'will continue to set out a positive agenda for the devel-opment of the Community'. Mr Gould is said to have been unhappy with the pro-European tone of the statement. The trigger for any possible split may come when the party decides what tactics to adopt over the Maastricht bill. The shadow cabinet agreed yesterday to remain silent on its approach to the legislation until the government position is clearer. Mr Smith reminded the shadow cabinet that while he had allowed public debate on the party's attitude towards Europe in the run-up to yesterday's meetings, the normal rules of collective responsibility would apply now that decisions had been taken. But Ms Clare Short, a 'soft-left' NEC member, said the paper did not represent an end to discussion on the issue. 'It is still open season for intelligent debate,' she said. The first real test of whether Mr Gould intends to abide by the new policy statement will be his appearance this morning at a press conference to publish a pamphlet critical of the leadership's stance. Further indications will come next week, when he will appear at several fringe meetings at the Labour party conference in Blackpool - including, on Sunday, the Euro-sceptic Common Market Safeguards Committee. Meanwhile, the leadership was aiming to play down the significance of articles to be published in two leftwing papers this morning, in which Mr Gould returns to the attack on the Maastricht treaty. Officials pointed out that the pieces were written before yesterday's meetings. In New Statesman and Society Mr Gould describes the accord as 'a totally overt, not to say shameless, statement of the bankers' view' of Europe while in Tribune he warns against 'the establishment' in words that will be widely read as a fierce attack on Mr Smith.</p>

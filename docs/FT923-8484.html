			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / UN experts look for Iraqi weaponry UN experts returning yesterday to their hotel in Baghdad from a second day of searches for Iraq's weapons of mass destruction after US officials had warned that Washington would deal swiftly with any stalling by Baghdad, agencies report. For the first time since the UN Special Commission started work 41 missions ago, the team leader - Mr Nikita Smidovich - did not say where or how his inspectors were working in their efforts to track the weapons. Tension surrounding the team's work is high because of Iraq's latest warning that it will block access to ministry buildings. That followed an Iraqi pledge of better co-operation after the last UN mission was barred from the Agriculture Ministry in July.</p>

			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russia's cashless trade in Kazakhstan's gas - Diplomacy is keeping an 'incomprehensible' system going Robert Corzine Political confusion as well as natural gas condensate flows along the pipeline that links the giant Karachaganak gas condensate field in Kazakhstan with one of the world's largest de-sulphurisation plants in the neighbouring Russian region of Orenburg in the southern Urals. The break-up of the former Soviet Union has left an international border running through an oil and gas-rich area developed according to a single integrated plan. Production on both sides of the frontier has been maintained. But there is deep political and economic uncertainty about the future relationship between the various elements of the industry. It is compounded by a chain of non-payments. In the case of Orenburg, Gazprom, the integrated Russian gas company that runs the processing plant, pays nothing to the Kazakhs for the 3.2m tonnes of Karachaganak condensate it processes each year. And it receives no payment from the refinery 400km away in the autonomous Russian republic of Bashkiria, to which it sends the partly treated condensate. 'Its incomprehensible as to how the system works,' concedes Mr Vladimir Mirkitanov, an official of the regional government. But the products continue to flow because it is diplomatically expedient for them to do so. Officials say much effort is being spent to 're-create torn ties' with Kazakhstan on a commercial basis. But there are also moves to boost the capability of the regional energy industry to operate more independently, a development which is mirrored in other energy-rich regions throughout Russia. The debate in Orenburg and elsewhere over the future structure of their oil and gas industries includes the degree to which regions control their resources and the role of foreign companies. The outcome is not only crucial to the economic well-being of the producing areas; over time it could affect the level of Russian oil production and the amount it can export. The debate in Orenburg has been given added flavour by frequent interventions by Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the Russian prime minister, who was born in the area and began his previous career in the Russian gas industry with the local Gazprom subsidiary. He recently chided managers at the local gas industry, which produces about 6 per cent of Russian gas, for failing to move more quickly on plans to expand the number of products recovered from the raw gas. Regional officials say recent annual oil output of about 7.5m tonnes has matched the best levels achieved during the Soviet era. But Mr Chernomyrdin has criticised the local industry for skimming off the 'cream' of the resource, and failing to realise the full potential of existing wells. Mr Vladimir Yelagin, Orenburg's president, believes increased production of oil, gas and minerals - combined with a move towards extracting more valuable refined products from raw resources - is the key to developing the region. But Orenburg needs to gain control over a greater portion of its resources and attract foreign investment if it is to implement a strategy of using such reserves as collateral for loans to finance conversion of defence plants and non-energy joint ventures. At present regions control 10 per cent of their resources, but are demanding 50 per cent. But even if they succeed in the political struggle with Moscow, the problem of attracting foreign capital remains. The take up of schemes to encourage export-oriented energy joint ventures has so far been patchy. It is also uncertain how many companies will take advantage of a privatisation plan which will allow foreigners to bid for 20 per cent of the shares in regional oil companies later this year.</p>

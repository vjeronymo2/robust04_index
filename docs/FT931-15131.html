			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Downturn to Pounds 10.3m at Watson &amp; Philip WATSON &amp; Philip, the Dundee-based wholesale and retail food group, reported a 12 per cent decline in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 11.8m to Pounds 10.3m, in the 53 weeks to October 30, reflecting deteriorating trading conditions in the second half. Turnover improved to Pounds 492m (Pounds 461.8m). However, sluggish sales from the core business - supplying food to shops not owned by the group - offset good performances from its Spar and VG convenience stores, cash and carry shops, and its higher-margin catering supply division. Operating profits fell from Pounds 11.9m to Pounds 10.7m. Mr Ian Macpherson, chairman, said shoppers were spending smaller amounts, on average only Pounds 2.30 a visit by the year-end, compared with Pounds 2.60 last year. He added that conditions were particularly tough in southern England where the group was expanding its network of Alldays convenience stores. Many new stores failed to trade profitably, but business was better in northern England and Scotland. He said up to Pounds 500,000 lost through bad debts and shrinkage exacerbated weak sales. In addition, the group paid Pounds 470,000 in exceptional expenses associated with the closure of a retail services depot and restructuring of the retail services division. Earnings per share declined to 21.7p (25.4p). The final dividend is increased to 9.1p, making a total of 13.3p (12.8p). A 16.2 per cent stake in the group, worth about Pounds 15m, was sold yesterday morning by the Jacques family, from whom W&amp;P bought Amalgamated Foods in a Pounds 35.5m all-share deal in May 1991. The price was at 'a modest discount to the market', the group said; the shares closed 1p higher at 285p. Mr David Bremner, managing director, said the Jacques family made their intention to sell known in December, having been constrained by a standstill agreement precluding any sale before May this year without W&amp;P's consent.</p>

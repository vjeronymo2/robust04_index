			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / Law Society decision challenged The Law Society is to be challenged in the High Court over its refusal to pay compensation to a company which lost thousands in a mortgage fraud allegedly involving a dishonest solicitor. In the first case of its kind a judge yesterday gave Mortgage Express leave to seek judicial review on the grounds that the solicitors' professional body reached a 'fundamentally flawed' decision. Mr Robert Griffiths QC, for Mortgage Express, said the case arose after the company funded the purchase of a flat in Marylebone, central London, using the services of a solicitor whom the Law Society now accepted was dishonest. According to a valuation report the property was worth Pounds 160,000 and Mortgage Express agreed to loan the purchaser Pounds 144,150. It was only after completion of the sale in December 1990 that the company discovered that there had been an overvaluation and it had been caught in a 'back-to-back' transaction. The flat had been bought earlier the same day for Pounds 120,000. In April 1992 Mortgage Express obtained an order for possession. It later sold the property for just Pounds 72,767, leaving a total loss with interest of Pounds 124,021. Mr Griffiths said the Law Society had unlawfully rejected the company's compensation claim on the basis that the money was primarily lost as a result of the overvaluation and the subsequent fall in the property market.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] In Kasindol Street in Sarajevo, the Serbian police  stopped a convoy of a French nongovernment humanitarian  organization Premiere Urgence because it found several boxes of  ammunition in the convoy's vehicles. The headquarters of the  army of the Srpska republic has stated that an investigation is  underway and that a statement on this will be issued this  evening. For the time being we only have pictures of this,  which have already been sent to the world. Comments would be  unnecessary anyway. [The studio announcer-read report is  followed by a 2-minute video of Serbian policemen discovering  ammunition in trucks with European Union and Premiere Urgence  markings]</p>

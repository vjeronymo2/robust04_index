			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / Maxwell ruled a fraudster: Three banks win marathon civil case over shares acquisition Robert Maxwell, the late publisher, misappropriated pension-fund assets and fraudulently dealt in a company's shares in a desperate attempt to prop up his ailing business empire, a High Court judge ruled yesterday. Giving judgment on a civil action between Macmillan, a Maxwell group subsidiary, and three investment banks, Mr Justice Millett said the tycoon had been dishonest in his dealing in shares of Berlitz, the language school and publishing company. These were repeatedly used to raise money to repay debts within the Maxwell group of companies. Ending the marathon litigation, the judge ruled in favour of the three banks  -Lehman Brothers, Swiss Volksbank and Credit Suisse - saying they had honestly acquired the Berlitz shares which were later sold for more than Dollars 137m. That had been disputed by Macmillan which had begun the legal action in October last year to claim compensation. It had claimed the banks had known or suspected that the shares had been improperly acquired from Macmillan. The judge, dismissing its claim, ruled that staff from all three banks - Mr Mark Haas and Mr Robert Price of Lehman Brothers, Mr Stephen Foster of Swiss Volksbank and Miss Julie Maitland of Credit Suisse - had acted honestly. Mr Justice Millett said that before Mr Maxwell died in November 1991 the shares in both Mirror Group Newspapers and Maxwell Communication Corporation had steadily fallen in value. Mr Maxwell had to provide ever-increasing collateral to his bankers and lost substantial sums supporting the share price of the public companies. 'After his death it emerged that, in increasingly desperate attempts to prevent the collapse of the group, he had resorted to whatever assets lay to hand, whether they belonged to the private side, the public companies, or even the group's pension funds,' the judge continued. 'Many of these assets thus misappropriated, especially those whose proceeds were expended in the share-support operations, have been irretrievably lost.' Mr Maxwell transferred the ownership of the shares from Macmillan to Bishopsgate Investment Trust, another Maxwell company, on November 5 1990. This was done with 'fraudulent purpose' on Mr Maxwell's part so they could be used to raise money to support his private companies, and was against the interests of Macmillan. Mr Maxwell did not contemplate honest dealing with the shares for Macmillan's benefit, the judge said. Within days, the first shares were offered to Credit Suisse as security for a loan to one of Mr Maxwell's private companies. The judge said: 'The Berlitz shares were repeatedly used to secure the payment of debts owed to many different creditors, often being released from security by one creditor only to be immediately deposited by way of security with another.' All 1.9m shares held by Lehman Brothers were used as security for loans to Bishopsgate Investment Management, the fund manager of the Maxwell Group pension fund. The 2.4m shares held by Swiss Volksbank were taken as collateral against a Dollars 35m loan to one of Mr Maxwell's private companies. The 1.5m shares held by Credit Suisse were taken as security for a Pounds 50m loan to the private companies. After the hearing Lehman issued a statement saying: 'Our belief that we acted entirely properly in our dealings with the Maxwell group of companies has been fully justified.'</p>

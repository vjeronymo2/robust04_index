			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / Canary Wharf creditors back restructuring CANARY WHARF, the Docklands office scheme that went into administration in May last year, yesterday cleared one of the last hurdles on its way back to normal trading. Unsecured creditors voted unanimously in favour of a restructuring package which paves the way for the development to come out of administration and return to trading by the end of October, The 1,400 unsecured creditors agreed to approve company voluntary arrangements which will allow them to be paid up to 15p in the pound. A further 25p in the pound will be paid to 130 construction trade creditors to provide warranties on work already done. Backing by the unsecured creditors for the restructuring package was necessary for the Pounds 1.1bn refinancing package agreed by Canary Wharf's banks to go ahead. The approval of the Jubilee Line Tube extension to east London, which depends on contributions from Canary Wharf's bankers, also depended on a positive vote by the unsecured creditors. The government is expected to approve the Jubilee Line extension once the Olympia &amp; York companies come out of administration. The creditors' meeting at the Royal Lancaster Hotel in Bayswater, London, attracted about 100 creditors. The meeting lasted little more than an hour. Mr Stephen Adamson, one of the administrators, said he was delighted with the level of support for the company's voluntary arrangements. 'After protracted and complex negotiations with numerous parties we believe this is the best deal for the unsecured creditors who would otherwise have received nothing,' he said. Following the creditors' vote of approval, Mr Adamson, Mr Nigel Hamilton and Mr Alan Bloom of Ernst &amp; Young will apply to the High Court to be discharged as administrators. Their application will be heard within the next 28 days. The refinancing package, announced on September 10, involves the restructuring of Pounds 568m of existing debt, additional new finance of up to Pounds 278m and a further Pounds 300m payment to London Regional Transport over 25 years for the completion of the Jubilee Line extension. The creditors were told that if they had not agreed to the proposals, the alternative was almost inevitably compulsory liquidation, which would have meant that creditors would not receive any distribution on their claims at present valuations. Canary Wharf, which cost more than Pounds 1.5bn to build, has been valued at between just Pounds 50m and Pounds 100m. Once Canary Wharf comes out of administration, its corporate structure will be reorganised under a new parent company, called Sylvester Investments, controlled by the banks.</p>

			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / Survey of Global Custody (12): Move to join Swift is slow - Barry Riley examines the electronic bank payments system ARE THE leading investment management houses reluctant, like Groucho Marx, to join the type of club that would be willing to have them as members? Technology, in a tantalising way, is beckoning the investment management industry. A few high-powered personal computers or work stations with the right software and the right interfaces may be all that is needed to wrest control of important aspects of the trading and settlement process from the exchanges, the brokers and the custodian banks. The jurisdictional boundaries may need to be redrawn, but exactly where should they be inserted? Such battles are being fought in various centres, but in the UK a key area of dispute has been over access by fund managers to the banks' international communications network Swift, which stands for Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications. For several years fund managers fought to gain access to Swift but were rebuffed. In June 1991 just 68 per cent of the system's members voted to allow non-bank investment institutions into the system, a small margin short of the 75 per cent majority required for this constitutional change. Some institutions had hoped to use the Swift messaging network to confirm international securities transactions. 'Frustration was felt by many fund managers. The Swift system already existed and it would have been much easier to use that system,' says Mr Jonathan Rashleigh, finance director of Legal &amp; General Investment Management. The rejection triggered proposals by fund managers to find alternatives. An industry user group of institutions and brokers was set up late in 1991 to specify electronic trade confirmation (ETC) products which are now almost ready for the market place. The participants were mostly British but the bigDutch investment group Robeco was involved, and a number of Continental brokers and banks are likely to install the new systems. In the meantime, however, Swift has changed its mind. In June this year the banks voted 95 per cent in favour of letting the outsiders in, arguing that the upgrading of systems had made expansion more practical. Privately, however, some of the banks admit that their earlier opposition may have been rather short-sighted. Perhaps some of the fears that big fund managers might side-step the custodian banks have faded, or perhaps the debate has anyway moved on. This has been a complicated area because some of the big investment management operations have in any case been part of large bank-owned groups, and through in-house custodians have had indirect access to Swift. But no more than about 3 per cent of Swift transactions are thought to have been related to securities deals, and new formats might have had to be developed to suit the requirements of investment institutions. The position now is that some of the big non-bank investment institutions are considering Swift and are likely to join, but there is no lengthy queue at the admissions office. 'We will evaluate Swift fully,' says Mr Chris Smith, who is in charge of the middle office at Fidelity in London. 'You need to go into it with your eyes open. It's not a panacea.' Mr Jonathan Rashleigh at L &amp; G is also considering Swift. 'We are certainly quite attracted to the prospect,' he says. 'My bet is that a number of the larger players will join, but it is not going to be a landslide.' The question is whether many institutions will think it is worth stumping up the substantial cost of joining Swift when cheaper trade confirmation alternatives are becoming available. They will need to see a substantial scope for using Swift to communicate with their custodian banks rather than with their brokers. Meanwhile the ETC systems are all but ready, and will be good enough for the requirements of many of the smaller and medium-sized investment managers. Some argue that if fund management houses had been given access to Swift earlier and could have used it for confirming international securities transactions other systems might not have been required. Essentially the problem has been in coping with inefficiencies in overseas securities transactions. These are more difficult to handle than domestic trades, information on which is sent out by the London Stock Exchange by computer every night, so that any mismatches can be spotted next morning. However, when it comes to cross-border transactions a significant percentage go wrong, and up to 10 per cent may not settle on the normal day. This can in itself be expensive. In addition the whole process is being given momentum by the pressure from the Group of 30 which is trying to push stock exchanges around the world to adopt a three-day settlement standard. In the case of trade confirmation fund managers still have to cope with archaic methods such as telexes, faxes or letters, which introduce delays of 24 hours or more. Along with delays go increased risks of losses from failed transactions because misunderstandings and errors are not picked up quickly. Therefore strong pressures have developed for the introduction of compatible systems which can achieve instant electronic information transfer using standard formats. In practice the new ETC networks should be capable of providing trade confirmation within minutes of the order being placed. Mr Sean Quinn of Chase in London argues that the new electronic communications will substantially improve efficiency. 'At present there can be quite a lot of toing and froing before we get our instructions,' he says. 'We have to wait until investors and banks have agreed their transactions.' At SG Warburg Mr Gordon Lindsay, managing director of custody, takes a similar view. 'These developments will help to automate the process and eventually allow us to reduce staff levels slightly,' he says. As for Swift, meanwhile, the bankers in their club may be able to relax in the knowledge that many of the fund managers will not be filling in their membership forms after all. THE complex flow of information that has to take place before a securities trade can be completed is becoming increasingly automated. Many of the messages, such as those to local custodians or to representatives in local markets, are carried on Swift, the interbank messaging system. However, telex and fax machines continue to play a part in communications between investors on the one hand and their brokers and custodians on the other - though messages between investors and custodians are sometimes carried on the custodians' own proprietary systems. ETC (Electronic Trade Confirmation) and ISITC (Industry Standardisation for Institutional Communications) are intended to fill these gaps. ETC will automate trade confirmation between investors and their brokers. ISITC will perform the same function between investors and custodians. Once completed, the process will be handled electronically.</p>

			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Powers 'limit VAT appeals' THE government is to grant Customs draconian powers which will make it more difficult for businesses to appeal against VAT assessments. Labour said yesterday that clause 46 of the Finance Bill, which implements the Budget, would restrict the right of businesses to appeal against VAT charged on goods and services bought for business rather than private use. But the government argued that under the current system inconsistent decision-making by tribunals had resulted in businesses being allowed to reclaim VAT paid on goods such as hi-fi systems, personalised number plates and yachts.</p>

			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / International Company News: Wang recovers to a modest Dollars 400,000 WANG Laboratories, the US computer systems company struggling to emerge from bankruptcy protection, yesterday reported a small net profit for its second fiscal quarter. The net profit of Dollars 400,000 included a Dollars 19.4m gain from foreign exchange adjustments, balancing a currency exchange loss of Dollars 19.5m in the first quarter. Second-quarter losses last time were Dollars 6.8m. The operating loss for the quarter was Dollars 6m, which compares with an operating profit of Dollars 7.8m last year. Revenues for the quarter were Dollars 351.2m, down from Dollars 500.7m last time. The second-quarter results reflect the impact of cost reductions and restructuring efforts, Wang said. Profit margins were, however, reduced by worldwide pricing pressures and a continuing shift in customer demand towards lower-priced products, it added. For the half-year, it reported a net loss of Dollars 66.2m, or 39 cents, compared with a net loss of Dollars 16.6m, or 10 cents. Six-month revenues totalled Dollars 711.2m, against Dollars 961.8m. 'The company continues to expect a successful and timely emergence from its Chapter 11 (bankruptcy) proceedings,'it said. Wang recently announced that it would eventually eliminate manufacturing operations.</p>

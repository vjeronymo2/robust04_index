			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / Chernobyl fears cloud EU-Ukraine pact: Partnership agreement signed yesterday aims at eventual creation of free trade zone Mounting European Union fears about the safety of the Chernobyl nuclear plant in the former Soviet republic of Ukraine overshadowed yesterday's signing of a partnership and co-operation agreement aimed at reaching a common free trade zone by around the end of the century. A similar accord with Russia is due to be initialled next week in Corfu at the summit of EU leaders. According to Mr Theodoros Pangalos, European affairs minister of Greece, current EU president, President Boris Yeltsin has confirmed he will attend the meeting. Ukraine's President Leonid Kravchuk, in Luxembourg yesterday for the signing, said he regarded the partnership agreement as a first step towards eventual Ukrainian membership of the EU. He did not raise the question of nuclear security, EU diplomats said. This is despite a letter to the Greek presidency from Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany and President Francois Mitterrand of France, calling for action on Chernobyl to be 'at the heart of our forthcoming summit'. Germany and France, with wide backing among their partners, want the summit to agree on a support framework for the overhaul of Ukraine's energy sector, to make possible an early shutdown of the Chernobyl nuclear reactors. Mr Jacques Delors, European Commission president, told Mr Kravchuk that fears about Chernobyl had pushed it near the top of the EU agenda. 'I think I can speak for all of us,' he said, 'that the only solution is the complete and rapid closure of this nuclear facility.' Ukraine is stalling over closure while it seeks alternative energy sources and a large payment from the west. The nuclear power station is plagued with problems. Experts are currently searching for the source of a seven-day leak of radioactive water from a cooling pond where spent fuel rods are stored at reactor number 2. An official from Ukraine's nuclear supervisory body, Mr Boris Yukhimenko, claimed that 'nothing alarming has occurred' pointing out that radiation levels are normal and that the reactor has been closed since a 1991 fire. Meanwhile, two tons of contaminated water are leaking daily. The Franco-German initiative aims at providing new EU funds for the nearly exhausted Nuclear Safety Account, which is managed by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. It also wants the World Bank to play a central role in co-ordinating efforts to develop safer and alternative energy sources in Ukraine. Senior German, British and French officials make clear that no figures for EU aid will be decided at Corfu, because the Union wants the US and Japan to pledge significant finance for the scheme at next month's Group of Seven summit in Naples. 'We are after the maximum multiplying effect,' said one ambassador. Ukraine in recent months has talked of energy restructuring needs running to around Ecu10bn (Pounds 7.7bn). But officials say this is a long-term projection, whereas the Franco-German letter indicates that what is needed now are funds sufficient to close Chernobyl and bring the reactors at Zaporodje, Khrnelnitski and Rovno up to western European safety standards. Mr Delors underlined to Mr Kravchuk that it was also an urgent priority for the EU that Ukraine should sign the non-proliferation treaty. Until this was done, warned Mr Willy Claes, Belgian foreign minister, several member states would be unable to ratify yesterday's agreement. Despite the new closeness in the EU's relationship with the east the partnership deal is meant to cement, Belgium was the only member state to field a foreign minister at yesterday's signing.</p>

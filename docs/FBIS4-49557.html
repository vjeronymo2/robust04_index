			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 14 April (XINHUA) -- The State Council's  General Office recently issued a circular prohibiting the use of  renminbi and treasury bond designs on publicity articles,  publications, and other commodities.    The circular says: In March 1991, the People's Bank of  China,  the Public Security Ministry, the State Administration for  Industry and Commerce, the Press and Publications  Administration, and the Ministry of Radio, Film and Television  jointly issued a "circular concerning the use of the renminbi,  foreign currency, and treasury bond designs on publicity  articles, publications, and relevant commodities." This  circular played an active role in strengthening the management  of the renminbi and treasury bonds. But the use of the renminbi  and treasury bond designs on publicity articles, publications,  and commodities occurs frequently, providing opportunities for  criminal elements to cheat and disturb financial order.    To safeguard the reputation and dignity of the renminbi and  treasury bonds, the newly issued circular says: Without the  approval of the People's Bank of China, no units or individuals  are allowed to print, in any form, certificate or notes  imitating the renminbi. Nor are they allowed to print renminbi  and treasury bond designs on publicity articles, publications,  and other commodities. It is necessary to strengthen the  supervision and management of printing, publication, movies,  television, and advertisement units, as well as other commodity  manufacturers. If publicity articles, publications, and other  commodities are found to be printed with such designs without  the approval of the People's Bank of China, they should be  confiscated immediately and destroyed on the spot. For those  which have been sold, the illegal income from the sales shall be  confiscated and a fine of no more than the sale income shall be  imposed. Personnel directly in charge of this activity or  involved in this activity shall be investigated.    The circular urges that all localities and departments  should  conscientiously organize inspections, that press units should  conduct propaganda campaigns, and relevant units should  strengthen their supervision and management so as to stop the  misuse of such designs.</p>

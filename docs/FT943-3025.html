			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / Crimean parliament seeks government resignation The parliament of the autonomous Crimean peninsula in Ukraine has called for the resignation of the regional government, Matthew Kaminski and agencies report. Before the no-confidence vote Mr Yevgeny Saburov, deputy prime minister and acting head of government, tendered his resignation, saying he did not 'see the possibility of working further in a constructive way if this situation continues'. President Yuri Meshkov refused to accept the resignation. 'Saburov's still the government chief,' said Mr Sergei Nikolsky, agriculture minister. 'But the way things are going we will all be out of a job quite soon.' The no-confidence vote follows a confrontation over the parliament's decision to strip President Meshkov of many of his powers. The president, elected on a populist ticket in January, announced on Sunday he was disbanding parliament and introducing presidential rule. But the president's gesture of reopening parliament two days later encouraged MPs to demand the dismissal of the government before it would begin talks over the president's powers.</p>

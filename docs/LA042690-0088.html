			<p><P> April 26, 1990, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> ROCKINGHAM REGAINS ROLE BY DEFAULT  </P> <P> There was a time when racing at Rockingham Park was the centerpiece of the New  England thoroughbred season. Horses would run in Rhode Island during the  winter, at Boston's Suffolk Downs in the spring and at the Rock during the  summertime. Located on the Massachusetts-New Hampshire border, Rockingham was  pretty, immaculate and well-run, and it was so popular that it drew average  daily crowds of more than 15,000 during some years of the 1960s.  </P> <P> Rockingham has now reclaimed its old role as New England's pre-eminent track,  only this time it has earned the distinction by default. There is no more New  England thoroughbred circuit. Horses disappeared from Rhode Island (and were  replaced by greyhounds) years ago. Suffolk Downs was shut down by owner Buddy  LeRoux at the end of 1989. Rockingham has managed to survive by offering cheap  racing at a modest physical plant.  </P> <P> The decline of New England racing has been pitiful and slightly mystifying,  because the region has the commodity most essential to any racetrack's success:  Enthusiastic horseplayers. Greater Boston has a big blue-collar population that  loves to gamble and manages to support two greyhound tracks, which operate  concurrently, often with day-night doubleheaders. They love horses too.  </P> <P> "These are great fans," said Rockingham publicist Bill Nader. "They put up with  a lot -- maybe like nowhere in the country. One day here we had a blizzard and  a sleet storm that was so bad that it took me an hour to scrape the ice off my  windshield. And we still handled $130,000 on the card!"  </P> <P> Besides this base of fans, New England always has had an exceptionally strong  contingent of horsemen and horses. It had all the makings of a top racing  circuit. "Racing here could be on the level of Maryland or New Jersey," said  Rockingham General Manager Ed Callahan.  </P> <P> What makes New England different from Maryland or New Jersey is that it is  divided into political jurisdictions, none of which has ever displayed much  concern for the well-being of the thoroughbred industry. Searching for  increased revenues, each state authorized expansion of its racing dates and  created head-on conflicts among the tracks, which succeeded in putting Rhode  Island permanently out of the thoroughbred business. Rockingham and Suffolk  coexisted until a fire destroyed most of the Rockingham grandstand in 1980.  </P> <P> Suffolk then started running year-round, and when Rockingham was reopened in  1984, Suffolk's management wouldn't cede any part of the racing calendar.  Operating in head-on conflict, neither track could prosper; both were  struggling to survive. Because of its metropolitan location, Suffolk figured to  be the stronger operation, but owner Buddy LeRoux thought his property was  worth far more as real estate than it was as a racetrack -- so he shut it down,  leaving New England horseplayers only with Rockingham and a steady diet of  cheap claiming races.  </P> <P> Racing fans in Massachusetts clung to the hope that a white knight would arrive  and save horse racing in the state. The late Frank De Francis had been  interested in buying or leasing Suffolk, and so had Ladbrokes, the huge British  bookmaking firm, but both were put off by LeRoux's intransigence as well as the  thicket of political problems in the state. Then came a new white knight: Ben  Simone, a prominent road builder, who proposed to erect a track in the town of  Wrentham. Even an ordinarily cynical journalist said: "We're used to ripping  everybody involved in racing here, but nobody knocks this guy. He's a gentleman  and a sportsman. He wants to do it right."  </P> <P> Simone owned the land and had the necessary capital; all he needed was approval  of a town referendum. On Monday night, the citizens of Wrentham voted down his  plan for a racetrack. Massachusetts is back to square one.  </P> <P> Since Massachusetts has been without a horse track, business at the Rock has  been booming -- it is up 35 percent over a year ago -- and track management has  earmarked this windfall for improvement of the physical facilities and  increases in purses. But Rockingham is still afraid to make an all-out  commitment to becoming a top-class facility, for fear of what might happen in  the neighboring state. "I think it's definite that Massachusetts will be back,"  Callahan said. "I don't see how New England is going to go without another  track."  </P> <P> If that happens, he said, "Ideally what I'd like to see is all the states try  to get together, have tracks with seasonal operations and try to put together a  regional off-track betting system. It's on the horizon, and Maine, Vermont and  New Hampshire are all looking for new income." Of course, such interstate  cooperation may be a pipe dream, because it was the lack of interstate  cooperation on racing dates that has created so many problems.  </P> <P> For the foreseeable future, anyway, New England racing will be synonymous with  Rockingham Park. The track's management is able and well-intentioned but it  faces a formidable task if it wants to upgrade its facilities or the quality of  its competition to anything approaching a major-league level. On a recent  Sunday, there wasn't a single horse on the entire card who was worth more than  $7,500. It will be a long time before New England's long-suffering but devoted  horseplayers get the quality of racing they deserve.  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 8, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SOCKERS HOPE TO RECEIVE TITLE ON NEXT CRAZY BOUNCE  </P> <P> Crazy, isn't it?  </P> <P> There has to be a script hidden behind all of this. Maybe it was cooked up in  the Major Indoor Soccer League office as a form of promotion.  </P> <P> First, the Sockers lost a game it appeared they would win, surrendering a  two-goal lead to the Baltimore Blast late in Game 1 of the championship series  at Baltimore.  </P> <P> The next night, the Sockers blew another two-goal lead. Same result? Nope. This  time, they won.  </P> <P> That took matters to San Diego. There, in Games 3 and 4, the Sockers won two  games they were supposed to win, setting up Game 5, which they were really  supposed to win.  </P> <P> And?  </P> <P> They lost.  </P> <P> It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out there's something a bit  strange here. History told us the Sockers wouldn't lose Game 5, forcing them to  travel with a 3-2 lead for Game 6 at the Baltimore Arena tonight at 4:35 and,  if necessary, Game 7 on Saturday.  </P> <P> Tuesday was the first time in nine meetings the Sockers have lost a home  playoff game to the Blast. It was also the first time the Sockers lost a game  in which they had the opportunity to wrap a championship series.  </P> <P> It all seems so improbable. After all, the Sockers are supposed to be the only  ones who dare to come back to win a playoff series when down three games to  one. They've done it twice, defeating Minnesota in the 1986 championship series  and Kansas City in the Western Division finals last season.  </P> <P> But Baltimore is seeking to strike a blow for parity in a league seemingly  forever dominated by the six-time champion Sockers.  </P> <P> Blast Coach Kenny Cooper made a little prediction before Tuesday's game, saying  his team would take the championship if it could win Game 5. Predictions mean  little; this series is overflowing with surprises, momentum shifts and  last-second victories. But, if nothing else, Tuesday's result gave him reason  for optimism.  </P> <P> "We applied ourselves," he said. "The difference was we executed. This is a  building block for us."  </P> <P> The Sockers will try to block it out. Coach Ron Newman did his best to hide  disappointment Tuesday while staring at a clutter of camera lights and  notebooks. He was asked if he was disappointed not to win the championship at  home. He responded: "I think we're going to win it in Baltimore on Prime  Ticket, and there are more people watching on Prime Ticket than here at the  stadium."  </P> <P> But dissatisfaction was apparent. Not far away were unopened champagne bottles.  There was no reason for a drink, and no time. At 7 the next morning, the  Sockers boarded a plane for Baltimore.  </P> <P> There was anger in the locker room. Players knew they hadn't turned in a  polished performance for their most enthusiastic, and largest, home crowd of  the season. Still, this team wasn't dead. Some spunk and desire remain.  </P> <P> "It's all right," midfielder Waad Hirmez said after admitting his  disappointment. "I guess it wasn't meant for us to win it at home. We'll win it  on the road. We've done it there before. There's no reason we can't do it  Thursday or Saturday."  </P> <P> To do so, the Sockers will need more of what helped them win three of the first  four. Contributions from Steve Zungul, who entered Tuesday's game second to  Branko Segota for playoff points with 16; he played fewer minutes than usual  Tuesday and didn't add to his totals. And Brian Quinn: The Sockers have an  excellent success rate (16-2) when Quinn scores at least one point in a  championship series game. Tuesday, he didn't.  </P> <P> One way or another, a crazy season that started with financial woes, forced the  Sockers to wade through a host of injuries and required a speech from Ron  Fowler, the team owner, to inspire a comeback in the Dallas series, will come  to an end in Baltimore, for better or worse. The script will be complete.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Liberal Democratic Party President Kono on an </F> agreement on political reform bills with Prime Minister Hosokawa  at a joint news conference at the Diet building in Tokyo -- live]    [Text] As Mr. Prime Minister has just stated, the  precondition for reaching this agreement lies in the  understanding shared by both of us that there are numerous  issues, both international and domestic, that have to be settled  by politicians and that politicians have to take up their  responsibility to settle them.    In particular, I understand that it is necessary to work out  measures as soon as possible to deal with the recent economic  situation. Moreover, while no decision has been made on the  specific details concerning political reform, this term --  political reform -- seems to have been mentioned all around, and  my concern is that such a situation may lead to misunderstanding  in the international community.    And when we turn our eyes to the domestic situation, we note  that it has been voiced all around that political reform has to  be carried out, and I think many people share serious  apprehensions about the recent situation because no decision has  been made on the details of the political reform.    Anyway, while the people have persisted in demanding  political reform, we have reached an accord -- shall I say the  final accord at this point -- with Mr. Prime Minister on this  issue. In reaching this accord, what I have called to my mind  is the faces of many of our predecessors who have persistently  tackled this issue and who have made efforts for this concern.  As far as our party is concerned, there are many senior  comrades, such as Mr. Masagoshi Ito. And while feeling  gratitude for the efforts made by these predecessors, I have  come to make this final resolution.    And I would like to conclude my report by expressing my  gratitude to those comrades who have cooperated with me and  given me their support in making this final decision. Now, I  would like to invite you to ask your questions.</p>

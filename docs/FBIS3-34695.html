			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] SHIHAN has learned that House of Representatives  Speaker Tahir al-Masri has received a letter from Iranian Majles  Speaker 'Ali Akbar Nateq-Nuri.    SHIHAN has obtained the text of the letter, which urges the  Jordanian House of Representatives to adopt appropriate measures  to nullify the Gaza-Jericho agreement, dubbed by the letter as a  disgraceful treaty.    The letter asserted that a practical approach to nullify the  agreement is to emphasize armed jihad as the only and best way  to face Zionist schemes and colonialism.    The letter explained Iran's view toward threats to the  al-Aqsa Mosque in holy Jerusalem. The letter denounced the  Islamic nations' silence toward the serious, false decisions  made by what it termed the demonic Zionist movement against the  al-Aqsa Mosque.</p>

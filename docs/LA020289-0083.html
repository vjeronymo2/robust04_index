			<p><P> February 2, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> LE SEX SHOPPE IN STUDIO CITY TOLD TO CLOSE  </P> <P> Studio City's controversial Le Sex Shoppe was ordered closed by the Los Angeles  City Council on Wednesday under a law prohibiting adult businesses within 500  feet of homes.  </P> <P> But Robert Sarno, an attorney for the shop, vowed to go to court to try to  block the council action on the grounds that it violates the company's  constitutional right to freedom of expression.  </P> <P> City zoning officials have given the adult bookstore and video arcade at 12323  Ventura Blvd. until Feb. 13 to close or face misdemeanor prosecution. The  ordinance carries a penalty of six months in jail and $500 for each day an  adult business remains open in violation of the law.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Appeal Denied Unanimously  </P> <P> Wednesday, the council unanimously and without discussion denied an appeal by  the shop's owner, EWAP Inc., for an extension to stay in business until 1991.  EWAP is an acronym for Erotic Words and Pictures.  </P> <P> A 1986 city ordinance, which was inspired by Studio City residents' battle to  rid their community of Le Sex Shoppe, gave sexually oriented establishments  until the middle of 1988 to move if they are within 500 feet of residences.  Businesses with long-term leases or large investments in their sites were  permitted to apply to the council for three-year extensions.  </P> <P> Last Friday, the Flamingo Massage in Sherman Oaks was the first of 58 appeals  to reach the council. It was denied an extension. Its attorney vowed to  challenge the decision. Twelve adult businesses have gone out of business since  the law took effect, zoning officials said.  </P> <P> Studio City residents have battled for years to close Le Sex Shoppe, saying it  breeds crime. Police have made 24 lewd conduct arrests at the business since  February, 1986, authorities said.  </P> <P> "Le Sex Shoppe has been a big nuisance in the community for a long time,"  Councilman Mike Woo said Wednesday. The business is in Woo's district.  </P> <P> "We're pleased," said Polly Ward, president of the Studio City Residents Assn.  </P> <P> The Le Sex Shoppe chain has agreed to take steps to reduce criminal activity,  including increasing lighting, hiring uniformed security guards and installing  closed-circuit television systems to allow shop employees to monitor all areas  of the businesses, Sarno said. The action came in response to a nuisance  abatement lawsuit filed Monday by the city attorney against Le Sex Shoppes in  Canoga Park, North Hollywood and Studio City.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Ayhan Songar from the "Chat" column: "Friendly </F> Greece...."]    [Text] Yesterday, I discussed Greek claims over the Aegean  continental shelf. Let us expand the issue now and move south.  The Greeks are eyeing Cyprus with a hearty appetite and are  waiting for the day they will get the entire island. The reason  is that Cyprus is about 80 km away from our southern coast,  while it is much further away from Greece. Now, if the Greeks  get the entire island -- and that is what lies behind the plans  for a so-called federation -- they will consider it a continent  and thus lay claim to its continental shelf and territorial  waters. As a result, Turkish ships will not be allowed in the  sea traffic from the Canakkale Strait to Iskenderun Bay. This  is the equivalent of strangling someone.    The Greeks would not be satisfied if we agreed to a  federation in Cyprus, if we granted state status to the Fener  Patriarchate, if we installed church bells in the St. Sophie  Museum, and if we even gave them Istanbul and Izmir. Little by  little, they are tightening the circle around us. On one side,  they are establishing a close friendship with Syria and Egypt  and trying to form another hostile front against us from the  south; on the other hand, they are supporting the PKK [Workers  Party of Kurdistan] and trying to get their hands on our  southeastern borders. Furthermore, they are trying to establish  a partnership with the Slavic states such as the Russian  Federation, Bulgaria, and the new Yugoslavia. These states have  their eyes on us and have demands of their own from us.  Therefore, they are more than willing to become partners in such  a hostile front against us. This would leave Turkey totally  surrounded by a ring of fire, and we would not be able to live  on our land.    Please do not think that this is the script of an adventure  film or an imaginary fear. It is just another one of the  developments we have been repeatedly faced with throughout our  history and from which we managed to extricate ourselves each  time with God's help. It is not a new development.    I always say: Sooner or later, we will find ourselves in a  confrontation with the Greeks. In fact, Greek foreign policy is  based on enmity against Turkey and on war between Turkey and  Greece. They are not afraid to repeat that incessantly. For  now, they are coping with the issue through Cold War methods and  diplomacy, because of the imbalance of power between us and  because they have not yet solved their other foreign policy  problems. For example, even if they share certain common  aspects with Greece today, the Bulgarians have always had  certain demands from that country. Let us not forget the  incidents at the end of World War II. There is also the case of  Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM].  It is still a hot issue. The Greeks are afraid that if they  ask FYROM "to unite against the common enemy," then FYROM will  say: "Let us reach agreement on our own problem as well."    The imbalance of power between Turkey and Greece is obvious.  Our population is 10 times greater than that of Greece. Greece  cannot handle our ground forces. Furthermore, I do not think  that Greece's big brothers in the West would do much more than  say to it: "Good for you"; neither do I think they would run  the risk of a new world war that would start in the Balkans.    Besides, from the legal point of view, we would be the right  side in any Turkish-Greek confrontation. There are several  logical reasons for that. It would be something like a  "defensive war."    I hope my dear readers will not think that I am a warmonger.  I am a peaceful person. When you are pushed against a wall,  however, and people are trying to strangle you, there is nothing  else you can do.    If that happens, how would the fact that both countries are  NATO members affect the situation? Let us discuss this tomorrow.</p>

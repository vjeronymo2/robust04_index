			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Zhang Zhedong (1727 0772 2767) and </F> correspondent Cao Haiqing (2580 3189 3237): "Seize the  Opportunity, Deepen Reform, Promote Production, and Safeguard  Unity"]    [Excerpt] The regional industrial economic work conference  opened in Hohhot on 31 January. Regional leaders Wang Qun, Qian  Fenyong, and Shen Shuji spoke at the conference. Liu Zuohui,  Liu Zhen, Chen Youzun, and Xu Bonian attended the conference.  Wang Qun stressed in his speech that the reform should be  oriented to seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, promoting  production, safeguarding unity, and effecting the large-scale  reform, large- scale development, and large-scale advancement of  the economy.    In his speech, Wang Qun fully affirmed the region's  achievements in the 1993 economic work and stressed the  necessity of pushing the 1994 economic work onto a new stage and  a new level. Wang Qun said: This year is critical to  establishing the socialist market economic structure. The major  sign of embarking on a new stage and a new level is for the  economic structure to keep pace with the process of shifting to  the socialist market economy where efficiency is the central and  fundamental issue, and the region can effect an obvious  improvement in labor productivity and make even greater  contributions to the financial revenues of the state. Only  after embarking on this new level can we gain initiative.    He said: The central authorities have recently raised the  guiding principle of "seizing the opportunity, deepening reform,  promoting production, and safeguarding unity." By opportunity,  we mean the current situation. When viewed as a whole, the  current situation is favorable to our large-scale development,  large-scale reform, and large-scale advancement. Currently, the  world and domestic situation as well as the domestic and world  markets are very conducive to us. In particular, the third  plenary session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and the eighth  (enlarged) plenary session of the fifth regional party committee  have introduced one after another some policies and regulations  that facilitate large-scale development, thus providing economic  development with an excellent opportunity and favorable  environment. In addition, the region's reform and opening up  over the past 15 years have laid a relatively solid foundation  for economic development. We should seize this golden  opportunity to practice and work boldly.    He said: After getting a clear understanding of the  situation, we should catch sight of many difficulties. Some of  the problems we face, such as fund shortage, financial  difficulties, and deficits incurred by some enterprises, small  and medium-sized enterprises in particular, are the problems  with regard to reform that will surely emerge in our way of  advance. Therefore, we should not get confused by these  problems, but should enhance our morale and deepen reform. Only  by carrying out reform can we find the way out. Without  advancement, we will lag behind. And, refusing to carry out  reform, will only lead to to a road of ruin.    With regard to deepening reform, Wang Qun pointed out: In  carrying out reform, we should not seek outside performance, nor  should we engage in formalism. In reform, we should exert real  efforts. To carry out reform, we should also conduct renovation  and positively press forward technological progress. We should  also resolve the problems regarding work bodies, product  quality, and development. When shifting the structure, we  should lay emphasis on key projects, large enterprises, and  items producing good results. We should take the shareholding  system as the major orientation in conducting enterprise reform,  and adopt the methods of closing down, suspending operations,  amalgamating with others, and transfer to other units in order  to eliminate small, poverty-stricken, and money-losing  enterprises. We should establish the enterprise operating  mechanism that is suitable for the socialist market economy with  a view to improving the economic efficiency of enterprises. We  should attend to the following five aspects in line with the  central authorities' principles of pressing forward overall  reform, making breakthroughs in major aspects, using exemplary  cases to guide the road, and accelerating the pace: 1.  Establish and perfect the rural collectivized service system so  that economic patterns where industry, agriculture, and animal  husbandry serve foreign trade emerge; 2. Accelerate the  transformation of mechanisms among industrial enterprises and  make great efforts to basically complete the transformation of  mechanisms among small and medium-sized enterprises by the end  of this year; 3. Achieve success in commercial, grain, trade,  and circulation reforms to promote economic development; 4.  Achieve success in financial, taxation, pricing, and banking  reforms and support the development of enterprises in line with  the practical situation, state regulations, and the principles  of "facilitating the development of socialist productive forces,  the enhancement of comprehensive strength of the socialist  countries, and the improvement of the people's living  standards;" 5. Accelerate transformation of government  functions and support reform of organizations and assign young  and capable cadres to the first line of economic development and  to industrial, commercial, tax affairs, and security and law  departments in an effort to ensure the smooth progress of  economic reform and development.

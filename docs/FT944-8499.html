			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / International Company News: Honda races ahead in first half Honda, the Japanese carmaker, more than doubled pre-tax profits in the first half in spite of disappointing domestic performance. It was lifted by strong sales in North America and Europe, cost-cutting measures, and the sale of its stake in Rover, the UK automotive group. This was the first time in four years that Honda was able to report a rise in profits, the group said. The outlook for the second-half performance was even better as car sales in Japan in the latter half were expected to recover, it added. In the six months to September, Honda enjoyed buoyant demand in the North American and European markets which supported a 6 per cent rise in group revenues to Y1,991.4bn (Dollars 20.3bn) from a previous Y1,874.8bn. Recurring profits - before extraordinary items and tax - more than doubled to Y56.7bn from Y22.5bn previously, although the figure was helped by a Y14.6bn gain from the sale of Honda's 20 per cent share in Rover, acquired by BMW of Germany. Net income more than tripled to Y38bn from a previous Y9.3bn, also helped by a Y12.8bn gain from the Rover sale. In Europe, Honda's sales were supported by an increase in output of UK-made Accords during the period and imports of US-made Civics. As a result, Honda was able to maintain price competitiveness against other Japanese carmakers in the region and became the only Japanese manufacturer to increase market share in Europe, Honda said. In the period from January to the end of October, 29 per cent, or 44,700 units, of the 153,500 vehicles Honda sold in Europe were manufactured in the UK, it said. This figure would increase further when Honda started manufacturing its European Civic model in the UK next year. In contrast to its strong performance in North America and Europe, Honda continued to suffer in the Japanese market during the period with unit sales falling 5 per cent. The value of its Japanese car sales increased marginally on a consolidated basis helped by the popularity of its imported cars and a decline in inventories, but fell 5 per cent on a non-consolidated basis. Motorcycle sales for Honda, which is a leader in the world markets, increased moderately as weakness in industrialised markets was offset by strong Asian sales. Honda expects firm results in the second half on the back of improving world markets, including Japan, a better product mix and continuing cost-cuts. The company has recently introduced a recreational vehicle in Japan which has seen strong demand. For the full year, Honda forecasts consolidated sales to reach Y3,991.4bn compared with Y3,862.7bn and net profits to rise to Y60bn, against Y23.7bn last year and an earlier forecast of Y52bn.</p>

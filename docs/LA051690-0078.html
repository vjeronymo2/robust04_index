			<p><P> May 16, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOL BASEBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> CLUTCH HIT BRINGS TITLE TO USDHS  </P> <P> David Sanchez of USDHS, the county's second leading hitter, on the county's  second-ranked team, hadn't had what you'd call a banner day.  </P> <P> Visiting Mission Bay made some great defensive plays, but nonetheless, in his  first three at bats Sanchez flied to right, was intentionally walked and flied  to left.  </P> <P> We now join Sanchez in the bottom of the seventh, with USDHS trailing Mission  Bay by a run at USD's Cunningham Field. There is one out. The bases are loaded.  And reliever Tom LaFever and Sanchez, who is batting .406, have worked to a  full count.  </P> <P> On the line is the City Western League championship, which Mission Bay had won  the past seven years. Mission Bay began the season 1-7, but surged and sat one  game behind USDHS going into this league finale.  </P> <P> Mission Bay Coach Dennis Pugh and LaFever chat briefly, then Sanchez digs his  bat into a fastball, a single to left, and USDHS defeats Mission Bay, 7-6.  </P> <P> So was Sanchez, who upped his season RBI total to 42, a nervous wreck or what?  </P> <P> "No, not in that kind of situation," he said. "I knew we could do it. I was  confident. I was just thinking how our club has been hitting really good all  year and that we could do it."  </P> <P> Said USDHS Coach Dick Serrano: "Technically, he's the leading hitter in the  county."  </P> <P> Sanchez, a junior, stressed that the victory is little more than a stepping  stone to the playoffs.  </P> <P> "It was an important game, but like coach says," said Sanchez, "we just have to  take them one game at a time, play our hardest and take them one game at a  time."  </P> <P> With the victory, USDHS (24-4, 11-1) squirmed its way out of a league tie and  won the title outright. Mission Bay (14-10, 9-3) finished two games out. Last  year, Mission Bay won the league title with USDHS finishing one game back.  </P> <P> "They played the way a championship team is supposed to play," said Pugh. "They  didn't quit. They played like they knew they could do it."  </P> <P> For a while, Mission Bay thought it could too, and almost did. The Bucs jumped  to an early 3-0 lead which USDHS quickly erased with a four-run third inning.  In the fourth, Mission Bay scored three times, USDHS scored once, and the Bucs  led, 6-5.  </P> <P> USDHS' Gavin Millay, who relieved Tom Shanner after 1 1/3 innings, gave up four  runs and five hits and went two for four, including a double.  </P> <P> Mission Bay starter Pat Betancourt gave up successive singles with one out in  the seventh before Pugh pulled him.

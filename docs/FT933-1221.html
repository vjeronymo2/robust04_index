			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Survey of IMF World Economy and Finance (7): Convalescence under way - World banking / John Gapper suggests the long-term prognosis may not be good BRIAN PEARSE, chief executive of the UK's Midland Bank, likens banks to the victims of a car accident. 'As you come out of it, you not only have to recover your poise, but learn some new tricks as well,' he says. The convalescence from the accident of asset quality problems in the 1980s is well under way. But while the health of the patient is better than at any time in the past five years, the long-term prognosis may not be good. The recovery of the banking systems in the US and Europe has not gainsaid questions whether banks have a permanent role as lending institutions for corporate customers. The accident that befell banks in the 1980s followed the deregulation of financial systems in the US and Europe, and asset price inflation in the late 1980s. Banks competed for growth by cutting margins - notably in big corporate lending - only to be hit by recession across OECD economies. US banks were first to recover strongly, helped by a strong positive yield curve that allowed banks to rebuild capital by holding treasury assets. Tier one ratios of core capital to risk-weighted assets are now commonly one or two percentage points above the 6 per cent 'well-capitalised' level. However, this has been followed by a series of resurgences in European banking systems as bad debt provisions and write-offs have fallen. The virtual break-up of the European exchange rate mechanism has both helped ease asset quality problems, and boosted banks' trading profits. British banks, whose problems were epitomised by the loss of Pounds 242m in 1992 recorded by the biggest bank Barclays, have started rebuilding capital by retaining earnings in spite of continued weak demand for loans. They are expected to keep increasing profits up to 1996 on a cyclical upswing. German and Swiss banks have also reported sharply improved results. The most remarkable recovery story has emerged in the past few months in Scandinavia. Nordic banks such as SE-Banken have declared that they do not require government support, and can instead raise fresh capital from rights issues. Japanese banks are later in the cycle than European, and are still dealing with asset problems from the aftermath of the 'bubble economy'. This has led to a substantial retreat from international syndicated lending in which big Japanese banks participated aggressively during the 1980s. The strongest profits from traditional banking in the year have come from Asia. A boom in Pacific Rim economies, together with the absence of strong debt markets as an alternative to borrowing from banks, has created large profits for banking groups such as HSBC Holdings. But while the environment may be safer, it does not offer the strong lending growth that has followed past recessions. This is partly because of risk management controls to ensure they do not repeat mistakes, and partly because demand is weak. Improved risk management has become a fundamental concern for banks as they try to allocate capital to the activities that not only appear to be profitable, but make sufficient returns to offset credit losses during downturns. This has led to re-examination of some lending activities. Among the 'new tricks' to which Mr Pearse - whose bank was acquired by HSBC Holdings last year - refers is the attempt to build earnings from non-lending activities. For corporate banks, this means trading and advisory work, and for retail banks it means selling insurance and savings. Caution about lending is partly because banks do not want to lend again at margins that do not reflect true risks. But it also stems from the desire to conserve capital. Regulators and equity markets are both placing increasing emphasis on banks having strong enough capital to absorb risk. Mr Roberto Mendoza, a vice-chairman of JP Morgan, argues that banks increasingly depend on strong capital to increase returns because it helps attract business. 'Counter-intuitive though it may be, return on equity in financial companies tends to rise the more capital you have,' he says. The increased emphasis on returns on capital achieved from various businesses has already led to banks retreating from ineffective overseas operations. It is now placing strains on European 'universal' banks that have diverse businesses. They may gradually be forced to concentrate on niche areas. The need to maintain capital is particularly acute for corporate banks because those without strong capital can in effect be barred from trading instruments such as financial derivatives. Yet such trading is required to raise profits because lending margins are too narrow alone. 'The low return from corporate lending is a big problem for commercial banks with investment banking pretensions,' says Mr David Band, chief executive of Barclays' securities arm BZW. But although there has been some revival in syndicated loans, many companies have looked elsewhere for finance. The surge in bond markets because of falling interest rates has stimulated the trend towards the 'disintermediation' of corporate financial services. Companies with better credit ratings than banks and fewer overheads can raise money on capital markets more cheaply. That trend is long-established, but banks' retail business is also being undercut by consumer finance companies. US banks have competed successfully in the buoyant mutual fund market this year, but consumers' increasing access to credit and investments from other companies may squeeze banks. These developments have led Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, to express concern about banks' future in the US financial system. The boundary between banks and other companies offering financial services is being weakened by banks' diversifications away from lending. Yet the paradox is that such worries are being expressed at a time when banks are as healthy as they have been for half a decade and shares have been rallying. Decisions made in the next five years on how to use their newfound capital will determine the patient's long-term health.</p>

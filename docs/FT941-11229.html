			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / Coal closures will cut workforce to 10,000 British Coal will employ fewer than 10,000 miners by the end of April after yesterdayconfirming the closure of four pits. The 10,000 figure represents a 75 per cent cut from the 40,000 employed 15 months ago. The latest figure compares with more than 200,000 a decade ago and 1.1m at the industry's height in 1913. The scale of the contraction is most marked in the north-east of England which, British Coal confirmed yesterday, is to lose its last deep mine, at Ellington in Northumberland. Just before the first world war Northumberland and Durham had 224,000 miners in at least 300 mines. After Ellington closes in the next two weeks, the only coal digging will be done by 1,300 workers employed in opencast operations, most of them for contractors to British Coal. Yesterday's closure announcements at Ellington and at Ollerton, Manton and Annesley, inNottinghamshire, will lead to about 3,000 miners losing their jobs. Earli er this week the loss of another 400 jobs was announced with the planned closure of Goldthorpe, South Yorkshire. There will also be considerable casualties among the 770 employed at Maltby and Silverwood, in South Yorkshire, which are to merge. At the start of this week British Coal employed 14,030 people at 22mines as well as 6,540 non-industrial staff and 2,940 others. This will fall byat least 3,700 as a result of this week's closures and mergers, and there will be a significant number of voluntary redundancies at the 17 remaining working pits by the end of April. An enhanced redundancy package, which provides for payments of up to Pounds 37,000, is on offer until the end of April. Although it may subsequently be renewed, the uncertainty will encourage miners even at pits with relatively secure futures to take up the terms on offer. Silve rwood is likely to survive longer, but it is the junior partner in the merger with Maltby. Silverwood will in effect be closed and although Maltby is not producing coal in large quantities it is likely to do so after the merger. Five pits identified for closure in October 1992 are still open. They are Kiveton, Maltby and Prince of Wales in the Yorkshire region, Point of Ayr in north Wales and Bilsthorpe in Nottinghamshire. Cory Coal, a marketing, preparation anddistribution company, part of Germany's Veba energy group, has joined a consortium formed by the Union of Democratic Mineworkers and Jim Walter Resources, a USmining concern, to bid for assets of British Coal.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature No. 66: Compiled </F> by Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy, edited by Vladimir  Shishlin]    [Text] The CIS Executive Secretary Ivan Korotchenya said in  an interview with INTERFAX on Wednesday that he has no intention  of running for the presidential post in Belarus. Korotchenya  explained his reluctance to ballot with the fact that "currently  the most important for him is to focus attention on work in the  executive secretariat."    "Undoubtedly, I am grateful to those who trust me as a  potential head of state, but I am convinced that the most  prepared man for this post among the candidates is the present  Belarussian Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich," Korotchenya said.  In his opinion, Kebich, "an experienced manager and predictable  politician, pursuing the consecutive policy oriented to an  economic union with Russia, has big chances to head the country."    Korotchenya said that tonight he leaves for Moscow to meet  with Chairman of the Council of Heads of CIS States Boris  Yeltsin. It is expected that the two men will specify the draft  agenda of the Moscow summit scheduled for 15 April. Besides,  Korotchenya plans to report to Yeltsin about the fulfillment of  his order to prepare the Moscow summit of presidents of  Azerbaijan, Armenia and Russia on the settlement on the Karabakh  crisis. IF Note: As a member of the CIS Interparliamentary  Assembly's peacekeeping group, Korotchenya visited Baku,  Yerevan and Nagorno-Karabakh from 31 March to 2 April. In his  words, "the leaders of both sides involved in the conflict  agreed in principle" to discuss the document on ceasefire and to  hold talks on the final settlement of the Karabakh problem.    The subject of peacekeeping efforts of the CIS  parliamentarians was raised at a meeting between Korotchenya and  UN Secretary-General Butrus-Ghali on Wednesday. Butrus-Ghali  proposed to register the Commonwealth Charter in the UN  Secretariat in the next few days. Ghali said that this will  enable "all countries of the international community to learn  better the principles, goals and tasks of the CIS, and its  structure." Ghali linked the need for the registration with  recent giving the observer status at the UN General Assembly to  the CIS.    Commenting on the results of the talks, Korotchenya informed  about the agreement "to establish stable business contacts  between coordinating structures of the Commonwealth and the UN  Secretariat." In Korotchenya's opinion, "Butrus-Ghali's  proposals open good opportunities for studying and using the  experience of the UN in the activities of the CIS."</p>

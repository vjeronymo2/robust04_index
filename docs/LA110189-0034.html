			<p><P> November 1, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> QUAKE COLUMNS  </P> <P> The Opinion section of The Times (Oct. 22) is one which I will save because of  the articles beginning on the front page. That wonderful reprint of Jack  London's "San Francisco, 1906," from Collier's Weekly, May 5, 1906, established  the precedent revealed in the following articles: that the spirit of the people  has not changed in 83 years.  </P> <P> Herbert Gold's actions and reactions in and to the quake were heart-warming and  impressive; and I loved the "kindly former wife" who had taken the trouble to  come by and leave a note on his door -- that all the children were safe and  accounted for. I hope she comes by again.  </P> <P> In any event, thanks for a fine set of articles. I shall read them again when I  need a lifting up.  </P> <P> ROBERT LONG  </P> <P> Walnut  </P></p>

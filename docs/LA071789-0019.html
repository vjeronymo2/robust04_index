			<p><P> July 17, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INTO THE NIGHT  </P> <P> The Scene: Premiere of "When Harry Met Sally . . . ," the new Rob  Reiner-directed romantic comedy from Castle Rock Entertainment (released by  Columbia) that's sure to be the feel-good movie of the summer. A packed  screening at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in Beverly Hills  preceded the packed party at the Beverly Hilton (travel time between the two  points was a half-hour) where guests immediately dove for the lavish buffet  dinner and listened to live big band jazz. Headlining the party, a benefit for  Comic Relief, was the young, much-hyped jazz guy Harry Connick Jr., who appears  on the film's sound track. While the studios were pleased with the spillover  turnout, cramming 1,700 people into the Hilton's ballroom has the unfortunate  side effect of making sweat break out on the upper lip.  </P> <P> The Buzz: After a glut of action-adventure pics, the audience seemed grateful  for a film that didn't involve semi-automatic weapon fire or decapitations.  </P> <P> Who Was There: The movie cast and crew included director Reiner, star Billy  Crystal (co-star Meg Ryan was filming in Hawaii), writer Nora Ephron; also  Bruce Willis and Demi Moore, Richard Lewis, Charlton Heston, Robert Townsend,  Rick Ducommun, O.J. Simpson, Scott Baio, Lesley Ann Warren, Shelly Long, Bud  Cort, Carol Kane, John Larroquette, Alan Rachins and Joanna Frank, Judd Nelson,  Shari Belafonte, Gary Owens, Fred Silverman, Garry Marshall, Ron Perlman, party  planner Sharon Sacks (she gave the room a Manhattan feel with a skyline  backdrop) and Comic Relief founder and president Bob Zmuda, who was very  pleased at the $42,000 raised, which will be turned over to the L.A. Homeless  Healthcare Project.  </P> <P> Quoted: Reiner's new bride, photographer Michele Singer, sweetly admitted she  wasn't used to being asked for quotes. "I don't know if I should be the one  quoted," she said. "I've never really done this before." Singer was reassured  that the Quote Police wouldn't arrest her.  </P> <P> Dress Mode: A mix of everything, from baggy shorts and sneakers to the  disco-ready look of capri leggings and tight-fitting tops. There was the usual  sea of suits (light gray and khaki for the summer months, but let's not forget  those Armani retro ties) and a smattering of "dinner dresses." Anyone dressing  in lightweight clothes was envied.  </P> <P> The Food: The Beverly Hilton catered up a storm, including smoked salmon,  caviar, pasta, Mexican food, crepes suzette and Caesar salad. Shelly Long knows  how to operate at these things; she politely asked a publicist, "Can you show  me the way to the caviar?"  </P> <P> Entertainment: The crowd continued to turbo-schmooze while the band played, but  when Connick came out, Reiner persuaded them to listen. "Find a seat, find a  piece of floor, a lap, whatever," he implored the audience. Most of the guests  had never heard of Connick, and when he appeared on stage his youthful face  caused one woman to squeal, "He must be 12!"  </P> <P> Triumphs: A good film buoys the spirits, and it was felt at this bash. People  wanted to stay despite the heat, the hassle-rich drive from the screening to  the hotel, the fanny-bumping crowd and the late hour.  </P> <P> Glitches: The screening was accidentally overbooked, and the overflow wasn't  entirely happy with the situation. It was quickly remedied with passes to  another screening and the promise of dinner at the Hilton, which about 70  people attended. The promise of food is always a good consolation prize.

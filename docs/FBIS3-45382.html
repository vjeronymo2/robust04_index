			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By correspondents Luo Guojun (7482 0948 7486) and Xia Ruge </F> (1115 0320 7041)]    [Text] Shanghai, 10 Jan (XINHUA) -- As we are currently in  a crucial stage when a series of major reform measures are being  introduced, we must meticulously organize and work hard together  to ensure the smooth implementation of these measures. This is  what Li Lanqing, member of the CPC Central Committee Political  Bureau and vice premier of the State Council, repeatedly  stressed while inspecting Zhejiang and Shanghai recently.    He pointed out: The introduction of a series of major  economic reform measures this year is an important step in  advancing toward the goals of establishing the socialist market  economic system determined by the 14th CPC National Congress.  Now we must pay particular attention to social stability, keep  commodity prices down, do a further good job in the tasks of  fighting corruption and promoting clean administration, and  control the size of fixed asset investment to minimize risks so  as to create a good external environment for accelerating reform.    During his inspection, Li Lanqing highly praised the  development of Zhejiang and Shanghai. He pointed out:  Shanghai's reform and opening up bears strategic significance  for the nation. The municipality has not failed to live up to  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's great expectations, and has made  encouraging achievements in economic development, market  establishment, Pudong's development, opening up to the outside  world, and foreign economy and trade. It has truly achieved the  goal of making changes every year. Zhejiang's overall situation  is very good, and the province has made notable progress and  development in various fields. In particular, it has made  outstanding achievements in foreign economy and trade, the  growth margin of which has topped the nation. There is great  hope for Zhejiang to realize the goal of achieving a better  living standard for the people ahead of time.    Li Lanqing heard work reports from provincial and municipal  leaders from Zhejiang and Shanghai, and conducted on-the-spot  inspection in plants, schools, and markets. He held discussions  with the people and heard opinions from all sides on grain and  oil prices, market supply, educational reform, foreign economic  and trade development, and anti-smuggling efforts.    He stated: When introducing new comprehensive reform  measures, we must pay particular attention to the inflation  problem and keep prices within the limit bearable to the broad  masses. The margin of fluctuation in grain and oil prices was  previously rather large. The State Council has adopted some  measures to tackle this problem, and localities should also  sacrifice a little of their immediate and partial interests.  They should apply macroeconomic control and regulation methods  to quickly bring commodity prices which closely affect the  people's life down to a reasonable level. Meanwhile, it is  crucial to develop agriculture and to continue to effectively  implement the "vegetable basket" and "grain bag" projects to  ensure sufficient total supply of agricultural products. As  long as there is an abundant supply of agricultural sideline  products there will be no panic, and our tasks in implementing  the measures will be made easier.    Li Lanqing asked Shanghai and Zhejiang, the two most forward  regions in our country's opening up to the outside world, to  make new contributions in using foreign funds as well as in  developing domestic and foreign trade. He said: It is  currently necessary to focus on the study of changing  operational methods and operating mechanisms as well as  enhancing the cohesive power of foreign trade enterprises. In  addition, enterprises should establish the incentive and  self-control mechanisms as well as carry out earnest experiments  in modern enterprise systems to boost more foreign exchange  earnings and upgrade economic efficiency. Enterprise system  reform should be standardized and should proceed in accordance  with relevant state stipulations to prevent losses in state  assets. State-owned businesses and enterprises should be  developed along the line of establishing chain commercial  organizations which combine group operations and retailing.  They should utilize foreign capital and adopt various ways for  key development by combining actual local conditions. For  example, Shanghai should focus on attracting investment from  transnational corporations, introducing new and high technology  industries, as well as adopting advanced operations and  management methods to raise the quality and level of foreign  capital utilization. In utilizing foreign capital, all  localities should attach importance to improving investment  environment, and should not blindly establish development zones.  Efforts should be made to link the construction of approved  development zones with the restructuring of old cities and old  enterprises.    Educational work is an important aspect of Li Lanqing's  inspection. He successively visited several institutes of  higher learning, vocational schools, secondary schools, and  elementary schools in Zhejiang and Shanghai, as well as held  discussion meetings with leading comrades of institutes of  higher learning in Hangzhou and Shanghai. After hearing the  opinions of teachers and staff, he stressed: It is necessary to  truly enhance the understanding in the issue of "respect for  teachers and importance of education." He said: Comrade  Xiaoping has attached great importance to educational work, and  discussed it rather comprehensively and thoroughly in as many as  27 chapters in Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng  Xiaoping. We should earnestly study, understand, and  practice his advocation. The saying "education is fundamental  for a program of lasting importance" should not be taken as  merely an empty slogan, but should be used for mobilizing the  entire party, society, and people to show concern, support, and  participate in promoting educational reform and development.  Vice Premier Li Lanqing expressed his appreciation to Zhejiang  provincial party committee for its promise not to delay payment  of teachers' salaries. Zhejiang has specified that counties and  cities that owe teachers' salaries will not be permitted to  construct school buildings and purchase small automobiles, or  even send personnel abroad, or pay salaries with advance from  provincial funds to be deducted later from monies payable to  them. Li Lanqing also expressed his appreciation to Ningbo City  for its plan to solve teachers' housing problems.    Li Lanqing pointed out: Further upgrading teaching quality  and school efficiency are the two key issues in current reform  for higher education. Apart from these, while implementing  educational reform, we should ask the people not to merely seek  a higher college entrance rate and advise students not to  confine themselves to the difficult path of seeking entrance to  college. We should vigorously develop vocational education and  adult education to enable more people exploit their skills  through various channels and contribute to society. He hoped  that Shanghai and Zhejiang would actively explore new ways to  vigorously develop vocational education. He fully affirmed  attempts by Shanghai's institutes of higher learning in  educational reform. He specially praised concerned schools for  making full use of social resources in joint educational  undertakings and in upgrading school efficiency. As for the  issue of some institutes of higher learning seeking to be placed  on the "211" project, Li Lanqing asked them not to rush into  making an evaluation as the placement is a development process.  Apart from standards stipulated by the State Education  Commission, institutes of higher learning should meet the  following three criteria: first, institutes of higher learning  of provinces (cities) that have not implemented basic education  efficiently cannot be placed on the "211" project. Second,  institutes of higher learning that have not undertaken major  reform measures cannot be placed on the "211" project. Third,  institutes of higher education should supplement one another  with their strengths and jointly establish the "211" project.    While inspecting local customs departments in Shanghai and  Hangzhou, Li Lanqing pointed out: Anti-smuggling is a long-term  struggle, aimed at improving the investment environment, which  we should earnestly address. He said: The party committees and  governments of Zhejiang and Shanghai should be commended for  their strong support for attaching great importance to cracking  down on smuggling. Although the vicious waves of nationwide  smuggling crimes have been curbed, we should not lower our guard  and should continue to realize the importance of anti-smuggling  struggle. We should tighten our investigation and prosecution  of major smuggling cases, as well as comprehensively implement  the principle of curbing and penalizing smuggling crimes on sea,  at coastal ports, on highways, and in markets. We should make  overall plans to snatch repeated victories in anti-smuggling  struggle before the Spring Festival.</p>

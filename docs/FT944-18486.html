			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / Lisbon acts on shop hours Portugal's municipal authorities are to be given powers to regulate retail opening hours in response to a campaign by small shopkeepers to ban Sunday opening by hypermarkets and other big stores. Mr Fernando Faria de Oliveira, trade and tourism minister, said yesterday the government would require large stores to close at midday on Sundays in areas where local authorities had failed to stipulate timetables by February 1995. He also announced an Es70bn (Pounds 280m) incentive programme to help small retailers modernise. Portugal has 3.8 retail food outlets per 1,000 inhabitants, the highest level in the European Union. Small shops accounted for 48 per cent of food retail sales in 1993.</p>

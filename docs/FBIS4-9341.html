			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Negotiations between the delegations of the Croat  republic of Herceg-Bosna and the Bosnia-Herzegovina Government  have begun in Sarajevo. They are to discuss the implementation  of the constitution of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Washington  agreement. Ankica Bosavljak reports:    [Begin Bosavljak recording] A working meeting beteen the  Croat and Bosnian Muslim sides in Bosnia-Herzegovina began in  Sarajevo this morning. The meeting is intended to prepare  deputies for the upcoming session of the Assembly of  Bosnia-Herzegovina. The negotiating teams are headed by Kresimir  Zubak, president of the presidential council of the Croat  republic of Herceg-Bosna, and Bosnian Prime Minister Haris  Silajdzic. The final result of today's talks should solve the  dilemma about the election of the future president and vice  president of the federation and the prime minister-designate of  the federal government. Even if no names are made public, it  will be known which nation will provide which officials.    In a break at 1400, Kresimir Zubak told us that during the  first part of the meeting they discussed humanitarian and  economic issues, and that though the talks were successful, the  more difficult, political part of the agreement was to follow.  Kasim Trnka, minister of justice in the Bosnian Government, was  also optimistic in his evaluation of today's talks. He  expressed hope that a successful agreement will be reached.

			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / Property: Double act - A bid to tap private funds for public projects 'By private finance, we don't mean paying an inflated price for blue-chip guaranteed loans. We mean putting the private sector in the driving seat, bearing and managing the large risks which capital projects entail. Too much of government has traditionally been the patsy customer in public projects.' Kenneth Clarke, UK chancellor, speaking of the Private Finance Initiative, a government scheme to attract private investment to public sector projects, launched in 1992. Mr Clarke's words were fine. But the Private Finance Initiative has failed to enthuse the private sector. As a result, the Department of Environment and the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors have appointed Chesterton Consulting, surveyors, to assess how PFI could be revived, especially to aid small projects valued at Pounds 5m-Pounds 60m. More than half the 78 projects listed in 1992 as examples of potential PFI ventures remain on the drawing board. Many of the rest pre-dated the PFI launch in any case. One flagship project, CrossRail - a Pounds 2bn line linking east and west London - was struck a blow in May when MPs blocked a private bill authorising construction. Although the government has revived the venture through a complex parliamentary procedure, it says the project will take at least 10 years to complete. However, the critics' main contention - that PFI has failed to provoke interest, such as on CrossRail - may be misplaced. One reason is that, as in any big civil engineering venture, the lead-time for projects can typically be two years or more. Many of the original projects associated with PFI, such as CrossRail and Heathrow Express, are large, with a long gestation period which critics have misinterpreted as evidence of lack of activity. In addition, in spite of the government's more enlightened vision about the role of the private sector, public resources remain as tightly controlled as previously (especially when placed alongside private-sector resources in a joint venture). The government can borrow money more cheaply than the private sector and therefore in absolute terms it is rarely possible to prove that a partnership with the private sector provides better value. PFI modifies this strict 'value for money' test in subtle ways. The extra cost of private money is now seen by government as being justified where its use brings associated advantages, such as the transfer of risk away from the public sector and access to better management. It is possible, though, to conceive of other benefits from the use of private finance, ranging from the fact that without it, a project could not proceed, to intangible spin-offs such as an improved environment. The most obvious area of application for PFI principles is in the provision of transport infrastructure. However, few groups are capable of financing such schemes, and many observers believe that the real challenge for public and private sectors is to make PFI work with 'smaller' projects, valued at between Pounds 5m (for a school) and Pounds 60m (a prison). One reason for caution may be that the DoE - one of the UK's biggest sponsors of construction - is uncertain whether PFI changes anything at all. The ground-rules implicit in Mr Clarke's quotation is that government contribution to any partnership must have a ceiling. Once that concept is introduced, the public investment assumes the nature of a grant. Many a recent public-sector grant could easily have been re-sprayed in PFI colours. However, DoE-sponsored projects differ in one important respect from those backed by other departments. A high proportion involve helping private-sector investments get off the ground, creating jobs and other benefits. In contrast, projects sponsored by other departments involve facilities for which the government is the only customer, such as prisons, higher education etc. It is in this area of public services that PFI is likely to enjoy most success. Where PFI is likely to meet with least success is in encouraging the private sector to come up with its own ideas. In spite of the government's expressed willingness to negotiate with a single private-sector promoter, PFI is caught in public procurement rules and, in particular, by EC requirements that contracts should be tendered. Private companies have better things to do than invest their time and money in new ideas if they then have to compete for the privilege of carrying them out. The government seems to be heading once again for the role of patsy customer. Although the private sector assumes risk, the perception remains that as the government guarantees the income-stream, it is therefore gilt-edged. On the other hand, the mechanism undoubtedly gives rise to a greater range of investments than could ever be financed through taxation. The author is national director of Chesterton Consulting</p>

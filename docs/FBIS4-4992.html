			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Discussion between Hisahiko Okazaki, former ambassador to </F> Saudi Arabia and Thailand and currently adviser to the Hakuhodo  Advertising Agency, and Motoo Shiina, independent member of the  House of Councilors; place and date not given: "A Time of  Ordeal for the U.S.-Japan Alliance"]    [Text] We Could Not Use "Rice" as a Trump Card in  Negotiations    [Okazaki] We have so much to talk about because so many  things have happened since we last talked together (for the  December 1993 issue). First, there is the topic of rice. I  think that there was no other choice but to liberalize the  market because the rice issue had reached the stage it had. If  Japan had refused to liberalize the rice market at that point,  the Uruguay Round would have failed. As a result, the stock  market would have crashed on the very same day. The world would  have blamed Japan for all the resulting ills, and economic  friction would have become really severe. Under such  circumstances, there would not be any prospects for the Japanese  economy's recovery. It was a crisis of that magnitude.    One can also ask whether we could have done anything at some  [earlier] point, before we were driven to such a situation.    [Shiina] We had a chance in late December three years ago.    [Okazaki) That was the time of the complete liberalization  of  beef and oranges in 1991. But that, too, was the outcome of the  pressure of continuous trade negotiations which had begun about  10 years earlier. I am not against the liberalization of rice,  but if I were to give advice to the ones who want to protect the  rice market, I think that the situation would have been very  different if we had asked [at that earlier opportunity] for "an  exception only for rice" and we had actually instead liberalized  all the other items two years earlier, rather than reluctantly  opening the market as a result of pressure.    [Shiina] As for skillfulness in the negotiations, we must  have had many cards to play because the volume of the trade  involved was so large. Including secondary industry products,  we should have used each card as one of an entire deck of cards.  But we could not do that because we went into the [Uruguay  Round] negotiations under a vertical-division system which  states that "agricultural products are under the jurisdiction of  the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries." And, we  could no longer use "rice," which it had been intended to use as  the last card and which thus was wrested away from us.    [Okazaki] It has been said that farmers could not make  career  plans for the future. Until now, the government's agricultural  policy has steadfastly insisted that we would not let even a  single grain of foreign rice into the country. But, because of  the outcome [of the liberalization] this time, do they now have  better prospects?    [Shiina] Not yet. They have been so busy debating only  whether to leave the outer wall the way it is, to lower it a  bit, or to take it down altogether that they have neglected to  discuss what to do about the situation inside the wall. I am  not sure whether the new agricultural policy will be any better.    [Okazaki] For now we have a six-year moratorium, but  liberalization thereafter is inevitable. After six years,  tariffication will be adopted, and the tariff rate will go down  every year thereafter. Everyone understands that.    [Shiina] There may be some people who do not understand  (laughter). Such people say that "we only bought a ticket to  the next station so let's get off the train there and think it  over again in the waiting room."    [Okazaki] I can tolerate that sort of people. The ones I  worry about, however, are the ones who are sitting in the  driver's seat on the train. The situation will be very  different 10 years from now, yet I wonder whether the Ministry  of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries has an agricultural  policy plan to cope with such a situation.    [Shiina] The people who are in charge of making agricultural  policy seem to be too worn out by their work to buy a ticket to  the next station. I do not think that the Ministry of  Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries is the driver. To begin  with, the drivers should be politicians and farmers themselves.  But the problem is that they maintain that they themselves are  also passengers. It is hard to find people who insist "Let me  drive."    [Okazaki] Then the situation is more serious than I thought.  You are saying that people have not been thinking about the  future while they have been insisting "do not let even a single  grain in."    [Shiina] No, they must have known that it would not be  possible to keep insisting on "not even a single grain." To use  the previous metaphor, they knew that they had to board the  train. That is why for now they have settled on "to the next  station."    The problem is that in the case of Japanese agriculture,  what  is poured into the land per area unit is greater than what is  harvested. In other words, the cost is exceedingly high. At a  minimum, they have to achieve parity between input and output.    [Okazaki] You mean government subsidies?    [Shiina] Everything, including government money, private  money, labor, and so on.    [Okazaki] I, too, worry that the government does not have a  policy. But on second thought, now that we have some prospects  for the future because of the recent agreement, what might be  more important is the "invisible hand."    [Shiina] That's right. We must keep in mind the element of  the "invisible hand."    [Okazaki] The era may have passed in which the bureaucrats  in  charge of agricultural policy determine "what should be the form  of new rice cultivation."    [Shiina] There are fine orchestras in European cities, even  in small cities, and they all get subsidies. But it is not good  to go around giving free concerts. When an orchestra only gives  free concerts, its quality goes down. When it charges an  appropriate admission fee and the people who purchased tickets  start attending, the level of that orchestra goes up. It will  even get to a level at which it will be asked from all over the  world to "please come." But still, the orchestra cannot be  maintained merely by selling tickets. At that point, subsidies  come into play. I think that agriculture should follow the same  thinking.    [Okazaki] It is true that every country in the world gives  farm subsidies.    [Shiina] The prices for agriculture products are low, and  when the bumper crops occur, they become even lower.    [Okazaki] Still, if they are made to depend totally on the  government and such, the "invisible hand" will not work and the  consequences will not be good.    [Shiina] It will become similar to the orchestras which go  around playing for elementary schools for no charge. They will  play haphazardly and say, "They won't know [the difference]."    [Okazaki] As I look to the future, things should not take a  form in which the government takes no role, but at the same time  the government should not assume full responsibility.    If the farmers make honest and full efforts, even if  recessions occur at times, the government would not abandon  them. I hope that the agricultural policy 10 years from now  will be in this vein.    [Shiina] Anyway, because Japan bought a ticket and boarded  the train, GATT remained intact. But there is no country which  bought a ticket to the end of the line, which is called the  ideal international free trade system. If we were to stick  rigidly to that principle, it would mean a planned economy on a  global scale. When Japan bought a ticket for the next station,  France bought one for the station after it. There was very  little order. And thereafter, the matter was left for the  future. Now, it seems as if the countries which bought tickets  for stations a little farther on are swaggering.  <H5>  Where Will Political Reform's Effects Show Up? </H5>   [Okazaki] Political reform has been achieved to some extent,  hasn't it?    [Shiina] It is often said that the "result itself is  important in politics." The upper house members of the Japan  Social Democratic Party [SDPJ] who opposed their party  executives' line this time have ended up being pulled in a  totally undesirable direction.    [Okazaki] That is right. This resulted in the bill that the  Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] wanted most. I wonder how they  justify themselves. I wonder if they think what they did was  right.    [Shiina] If they believe that "the SDPJ is in essence the  party of protest," then there is no problem. (laughter)    [Okazaki] But as a result, a single-constituency electoral  district system has been produced which is more disadvantageous  to them than is the single-seat district system that they had  been opposing.    [Shiina] For them, principle is more important. But then, it  is no longer politics. The raison d'etre of politics is to  improve things, however minute the improvement might be.    It is called the "rebellion by the 17." But at the bottom of  the situation, there is the LDP. So in that sense, the LDP  played it well. But it is also interesting that not all LDP  members think that things went well.    [Okazaki] Also, it is not clear if the LDP executives had  read the situation to that depth and went along. If the  executives had read the situation incorrectly and the bill had  passed by one or two votes, the LDP would have sustained quite a  bit of damage, damage both system-wise and image-wise.    [Shiina] Speaking of image, at that time the government  parties could have put the bill to a vote again without having  resorted to holding conferences in both houses and could have  dissolved the Diet if it did not pass. That way, they could  have said that "the LDP ruined political reform."    Getting back to the SDPJ, it is in a state in which it had  been taking a nap while leaning on the wall of ideology. But  the wall has disappeared, and it has tumbled backwards. So, it  is completely at a loss about what to do now. But there are  some unexpectedly spirited people among them, and they have  opposed [the electoral reform bill], arguing that "for our  righteous ideology to be accurately reflected in Japan, such a  strange election system is totally authoritarian."    [Okazaki] That is a logic which I do not understand.    [Shiina] Neither do I (laughter). But anyway, they must have  had the fear that if the election system were to change, then  the SDPJ would disappear. And yet, they do not understand that  it is precisely because they are still making such arguments  that the party is facing collapse. It is an issue which takes  precedence over the election system.    [Okazaki] I have the impression that they are acting that  way  because they believe that if the party is going to collapse  anyway, then it is better not to compromise their principles.    [Shiina] But even were the party to collapse, the  individuals could survive. I think that when the ship was  sinking, there would be more of them who would escape by  lifeboat and would say "let me get on your boat" than those who  would say "I will go down with the ship." In such  circumstances, one wonders what in the world the 1955 structure  was all about, in that it was so troubled by such a party.    [Okazaki] The 1955 structure, in concrete terms, was a  medium-sized electoral district system in which each district  had a quorum of four to five representatives. The first and  second seats were taken by the LDP and the third by the SDPJ.  Am I correct?    [Shiina] In other words, with the exception of some  districts, the SDPJ only had to run one candidate in each  electoral district. In effect, it was handled as a  single-constituency electoral district. Because most of the  time each of the [SDPJ] candidates was elected, it must have  been just fine for those people.    [Okazaki] But that system is going to change.    [Shiina] Still, they must have known that their number would  dwindle, even under the previous system, because they lost 70  seats in the last election.    [Okazaki] No one knows what will happen after the electoral  system reform this time. But it is still quite significant that  it was changed. When a system remains unchanged for a long  time, various kinds of system fatigue and friction occur.    The commotion at the Ministry of International Trade and  Industry [MITI] is one example. They made a special personnel  arrangement in order to accommodate a person who wanted to run  for an election. When questioned about this, the [MITI's] answer  was that "it is done routinely." I wish the bureaucrat who  answered had said, even if it were untrue, that "he was  exceptionally talented and there was no other suitable person  for that post. For the sake of the country, we had no choice  but to appoint him."    [Shiina] That's right. But there have been just too many  similar cases; that answer would have sounded too strange.    [Okazaki] Because there was a seniority system, which was  determined by one's number of terms in the LDP, when bright  persons who came from the provinces entered the top ministries,  they were quickly cultivated to become LDP Diet representatives.  Then, in turn, they protected the interests of the respective  ministries. This has been the system. I hope to see some  changes in the system.    [Shiina] That is why the change of the government is really  significant. In the past, when one served as parliamentary vice  minister, one was considered to be a two- or three-term  representative.    [Okazaki] Was that the last stage of the LDP era?    [Shiina] No, it was the middle stage. The reason was that  there was no one who had been elected 10 times as is the case  today. My father (Etsuzaburo) became chief cabinet secretary in  his second term. People said that that was quite an  achievement. But because the old-timers were mostly purged  after the war, the majority were second- or third-termers. So,  he was not selected in particular or anything like that. But  today, when there are many seven- and eight-termers, it is much  easier to adopt a personnel system based on seniority. The  reason is that unlike other regular professions, it is harder to  tell whether a politician is able or not. (laughter)    [Okazaki] It is no longer easy for someone to enter some  ministry in Tokyo soon after being elected from his district,  and to live a secure life as an LDP politician ever after. That  is because the possibility has arisen that such a person could  lose to a new new party candidate or some such person and lose  everything. It could lead to a situation in which it "would  have been better if I stayed at the ministry."    [Shiina] Then it will be the right kind of risk. In previous  elections, I thought that "it is not good that everybody has  become a populist." But such a situation may have positive  consequences, for in the upcoming so-called realignment of the  political world, the unsteady, not-too-bright politicians may  well be weeded out.    [Okazaki] I think when the reshuffle takes place, many good  things will happen, even though they may not be visible.    [Shiina] I am glad that political reform was achieved  without  a collapse. If this matter had not been taken care of, all  other matters would have stopped.    [Okazaki] As with the rice issue, political reform had to be  passed when the situation reached a certain stage. Otherwise,  they would not be able to work on economic countermeasures.  That is the political current.    [Shiiina] This, too, is like buying a ticket to a station  three stops away. "We will think later what we should do  afterwards."    [Okazaki] The fact that they boarded the train is  significant  in itself.    "Welfare" Tax Ridicules Japanese People    [Shiina] Next, let us talk about the "national welfare tax."  The [Finance] Ministry said [the budget] would be "compiled in  the new year." That was the ministry stringing the government  along, saying that "unless you make it clear where you are  going, we won't let you buy a ticket."    And finally, they tried to make them buy a ticket to their  destination. The timing was also good, and their words were  effective: "Unless you buy this ticket, you will be embarrassed  when you meet Mr. Clinton next week." So Prime Minister  Hosokawa bought the ticket in a hurry and tried to jump on the  train. But when he was told the ticket was not good, he swapped  it for one that would only take him halfway. The bureaucrats,  who thought they had succeeded "at least in putting him on the  train," found the ticket was torn from him almost immediately.    [Okazaki] But even according to the initial plan, the  consumption tax hike would take effect after three years. It  seems almost a foregone conclusion that, after three years,  consumption tax will have to be raised.    [Shiina] Public opinion surveys show people feel it is  inevitable. But the bureaucrats, especially Ministry of Finance  officials, regard the Japanese people as ignorant and do not  trust them. And because they think politicians are the  representatives of such ignorant people and "might do something  beyond the reach of our control," they tried to make them buy a  ticket for a special express train that would not be stopping at  stations along the way. They failed, though, to get them aboard  that train, and the situation is the same as it was at the end  of last year. That is why the incident [surrounding Hosokawa's  tax proposal] was useful, because it at least made the  bureaucrats realize that "not everything can be made to work as  we want."    [Okazaki] At the same time, there may be some benefit in the  government having started to talk about "raising the consumption  tax rate."    [Shiina] A lucky accident.    [Okazaki] Now it has been mentioned, everyone will expect it  to happen in the future.    [Shiina] And they will begin discussions about how to do it.    [Okazaki] When a party is in the position the LDP used to  be, with three hundred seats, every bill passed if the  bureaucrats skillfully pre-arranged them. The style of politics  is no longer one of perfection, though. If there is a hitch to  anything then people in Japan denounce you as no good and  disgraceful. In the United States, however, it is common  practice to submit a bill, delete a portion after debate, and  then resubmit it. I think the situation in Japan is beginning  to approach that style.    [Shiina] One can say that we have moved closer to  conservatism and away from socialism under which ministerial  offices manage a planned economy.    [Okazaki] It may not be a bad idea to bring up logically  sound proposals for which the possibility of success is about 60  percent.    [Shiina] The incident this time [Hosokawa first announcing  the tax plan and then almost immediately retracting it] is a  good precedent to show that things can be upset. In the  conventional wisdom of the past, if the LDP president had done  the same thing, he would have had to take responsibility. Mr.  Hosokawa, on the other hand, is still here. (laughter)    [Okazaki] It seemed the Finance Ministry would take in too  much under the original proposal. They opted for a six trillion  yen tax cut and a 7 percent consumption tax rise three years  later. It would have been better instead to opt for a 7  trillion yen tax cut. That might have brought about a more  natural increase in tax revenue.    [Shiina] To try to calculate during a recession is like  going shopping when you are hungry. You tend to buy more than  otherwise might. Also, it treats people as fools to think they  will consent [to pay] if the term "welfare" is used. It is best  not to collect taxes earmarked for a specific purpose. You can  see the problem if we use the analogy of the household budget:  Though you are hungry, as you have spent the entire food  budget, you can not buy food with the money remaining because it  is set aside for housing expenses. (laughter) Ultimately,  clever people show themselves to be fools if they take the  attitude toward ordinary people that "we can cheat them if we  describe things this way.".    [Okazaki] Nevertheless, it is not good that wise people do  not propose wise measures. I think it was good that this time  at least the issue was publicized.    On the defense issues that I have long been involved with,  even when we made progress in theory, we were told that "public  opinion has not reached that stage," and we compromised before  we made a public presentation. It would have been better [to  have made a proposal and] if it failed to pass, amended it. I  wish the LDP had had that much courage.    [Shiina] When proposal are made, they will be discussed. If  there are no proposals, there is no discussion.    [Okazaki] People feel differently about Mr. Hosokawa's  political ability. But, as a matter of fact, he depends very  little on vested interests. That includes areas such as rice  and automobiles. He should, therefore, be able to act  decisively. He should be proposing one wise measure after  another. There is nothing we can do if the foolish view  prevails after thorough discussion, but at least the matter has  been debated.    [Shiina] They should make use of the lesson learned from the  failure this time.    What The U.S. Actually Wanted    [Okazaki] I mentioned earlier that because there was only  one week left before the U.S.-Japan summit meeting, they agreed  on tax system reform. But I think it was a mistake in judgment  to decide on the figure of 6 trillion yen. The reason is that  the failed discussions on "micro" issues such as numerical  targets was not a significant enough prize for the United States  side claim "victory," even if a compromise had been achieved.  It would have been merely a draw. They [the Hosokawa  government] knew from the beginning their "micro" issue  proposals would not work sufficiently to satisfy the U.S., so  they should have bet on the "macro" approach.    I think what the United States actually wanted was an 8  trillion yen tax cut. The Japanese tax cut was said to be  between 5 trillion and 7 trillion yen. But according to the  opinion of many people I heard, Trade Representative Kantor  would have gone home saying, "we wrestled this much from Japan:  The meeting was successful," if we had come up with 7 trillion  plus something else. I thought everybody understood this. It  may be that the leadership did not recognize it or, perhaps it  did but was unsuccessful in controlling the Ministry of Finance,  which was not so aware.    [Shiina] I am concerned about how much the bureaucrats will  learn from that mistake. After all, they are giddy with  excitement at being able to claim "we said 'no'." But they  would also have been happy had they been made to swallow the  American demands because they could then have been able to give  all kinds of orders to the auto industry and others. They are  happy that they won the argument, but there is nothing for them  to do now.    The bureaucrats say "it is absurd for the government to put  a  framework on the market." That is a good point. There are even  some Americans who say, "let's not make the bureaucrats the  champions of the free economy."    [Okazaki] Right. That is why I think it is wrong for people  to conclude that, as a result of this incident, the U.S.-Japan  relationship has become a "mature," or that "we said 'no' for  the first time."    This time, the United States was out of step. It was clear  that they were unreasonable in individual negotiations toward  Japan. The USTR (United States Trade Representative) took a  hard line. But in places like the Commerce Department they were  embarrassed to tell Japan to "self-regulate." So the Japanese  did not say "no" to the United States, they said "no" to a  section of the United States. But because they made a mistake on  macro policy, they created a dispute with the entire United  States.    [Shiina] It began because Mr. Miyazawa gave an ambiguous  promissory note at the time parliament was dissolved. His  successor was told to "honor it." It would be quite  understandable in such circumstances to have said, "I can not  honor such an incomplete promissory note." But in the United  States last year they considered that they had received a  promissory note. They called responsible officials to Congress,  had a public hearing, and asked "does this promissory note bear  a bona fide signature," "is the date included?" They thought  they had confirmed this to be a genuine promissory note. When  it was withdrawn the United States held an empty hand, but Mr.  Hosokawa should have said "I can not honor that note, but I  want to exchange it for my own promissory note."    [Okazaki] That's right. He should have used the new  promissory note called 7 trillion yen plus something else. He  could have said that "the last one was issued by a firm that  went bankrupt."    [Shiina] They had to run around trying to take care of the  promissory note. They should have started in the first place by  rejecting a promissory note they could no longer honor.  <H5>  What Japan Should Do in Emergency on Korean Peninsula </H5>   [Okazaki] Here is the result of am MIT (Massachusetts  Institute of Technology) forecast of the future U.S.-Japan  relationship made two years ago in May. There were several  participants each from Japan and the United States, two Chinese,  two from the Soviet Union, and two from the EC. They divided a  dozen years into three segments and discussed each; the 1993 to  1996, 1997 to 2000, and the four years after that. It was  originally a secret strategy plan commissioned by the Pentagon.  But when some of it started to leak out, they turned it into a  document and made it public -- this is typically American.    What astonished me when I read it was the severity of the  Americans. It recommended withdrawing most favored nation  status from Japan if it would not reduce the trade surplus.  That was only a first step. It also wanted the United States  to conspire with NAFTA [North American Free Trade Agreement] and  the EC to isolate Japan. Since all the American "players"  agreed on these points, the situation is quite serious. In the  end, the evaluator said that "the U.S. strategy was formulated  to be carried out under ideal conditions which would not be  found in reality." The ideal situation they referred to was the  State Department and Defense Department having no voice.    Which means, though, that as long as the State Department  and  the Pentagon regard Japan as a true ally, we have a chance to be  saved. This will be put to the test on many occasions, but the  biggest test in the next two to three months will unquestionably  be the Korean issue.    [Shiina] The future forecast is very clear, but they do  not bear in mind the fact that everything they import from Japan  would be extremely expensive if they stopped giving Japan most  favored nation status, do they?    [Okazaki] That is not a problem. The United States would be  substantially damaged, but Japan would be ruined. They say that  would be alright. It is not a zero sum game, but if it is X  minus Y for this side but X minus 2Y for the other side, this  side wins. That is the Huntington theory.    [Shiina] If they calculate to that extent, it is really  something. But it is all based on the premise that Japan will  not change, is it not?    [Okazaki] The proposals Japan made were all concessions  (compromise): It has been constantly offering to purchase all  its new airplanes or all its new weaponry from the United States.    [Shiina] Will it not work even then?    [Okazaki] No. In its conclusion, the forecast describes how  Japan will be completely unable to resist the United States.    [Shiina] If the concession simply enlarges the bandage which  has been applied, there is some hope. In other words, Japan's  remaining task will be to cure its internal afflictions.    [Shiina] You may be right. If the Pentagon and the State  Department consider Japan an ally, no matter how bad economic  ties, the relationship will survive. The first test will be the  emergency on the Korean peninsula. When it happens, we must say  "yes" immediately in prior consultations. That is important,  because there is nothing for us to think about.    When Japan is given a time limit of "five hours," it always  mulls things over for four hours 59 minutes and 59 seconds, and  then says "yes." We should avoid that. If we make them wait  for five hours, young Americans will have died on the Korean  peninsula in that time. The United States, too, might need to  make preparations and might not be able to move out that  quickly, but we don't want to be blamed even for that. As for  the F-15's taking off from Okinawa, it is subject to prior  consultations because at the time of reversion of Okinawa we  made an agreement that "protecting the security of South Korea  is ultimately protecting the security of Japan." If we are  prepared to say "yes" immediately, that is acceptable.    [Shiina] I think you are right. And if there are any other  approaches we can utilize, we should make sure they are ready to  be used right away.    [Okazaki] That's right. What I just said is the minimum  condition, and it is harder to go further. North Korea is much  stronger than Iraq, so there is the possibility that any war  will be prolonged. We will then face the important issue of  whether Japan can simply sit quietly doing nothing with 200  F-15's on its territory while Americans are dying every day. In  other words, this is an issue of whether or not the situation  would lead to the collapse of the U.S.-Japan alliance. Japan  might say now that "South Korea would not want it," but if they,  along with the United States, were to come asking for our help,  then the Japanese people would have to make a decision.    [Shiina] At such a time the economic issue about which we  said "no" will become very minor in the face of a more major  concern.    [Okazaki] Right. Everything will be determined by the  Japanese response then. It is said that the United States was  prepared to take economic sanctions against North Korea in  April, June, and autumn last year because it was so  uncooperative. Each time they continued the talks, but the  patience of the public and Congress is about to run out. There  may be many more stages in the future, but if it reaches a point  where things are going nowhere, economic sanctions will be  imposed. And North Korea says that "your application of  economic sanctions will be taken as a declaration of war."    [Shiina] As for the U.S.-Japan summit, although the press  has concentrated on the framework talks, the two sides also  discussed the North Korean issue. Mr. Hosokawa said that if the  United States were to impose economic sanctions, Japan would go  along. But then, would economic sanctions be the end of the  matter.    [Okazaki] There is more to come.    [Shiina] At such a time we will not have the option of  saying "we will only ride as far as the station half way." We  must be prepared to go all the way.    [Okazaki] At every stage, there is the possibility of  resolving the situation peacefully. That will be alright. But  if events turn worse, we have no choice but to go all the way.  In that case, it is important not to destroy the U.S.-Japan  relationship. If we blow that, Japan will be ruined in the  economic relationship.    [Shiina] That is why we should stop looking at the  U.S.-Japan summit only through the magnifying glass of the  framework talks. You said earlier that as long as the Pentagon  and the State Department regard Japan as an ally, the U.S.-Japan  relationship will survive, and the test case would be the  situation on the Korean peninsula. But before we talk about  that test case, there is an unanswered question: In the United  States during the Gulf war there was much debate about "whether  or not Japan is really an ally."    Because an answer was lacking, neither the State Department  nor the Pentagon came to the fore when we were struggling with  economic issues. Unless we think deeply to this extent, we can  not simply say "no" on economic issues.</p>

			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / Bernie Cornfeld joins bid for MGM MR BERNIE CORNFELD, the controversial American mutual funds promoter whose empire collapsed more than 20 years ago, is hoping to make a comeback today when he joins in a Dollars 500m (Pounds 324m) cash bid for Hollywood's MGM film studio. The 65-year-old Mr Cornfeld said he was joining forces for the bid with Mr Giovanni Di Stefano, a former business associate of Mr Giancarlo Parretti, the Italian former owner of MGM. Mr Di Stefano is locked in several legal battles with Credit Lyonnais, the French state bank that suffered embarrassment last year when it was revealed to have loaned Mr Parretti Dollars 1bn for his successful 1990 MGM bid. The French bank then forced Mr Parretti out of MGM in a US court and last spring took possession of the once great studio, which is believed to be making heavy losses. Mr Di Stefano, who once spent three years in prison in the UK after being convicted of fraudulent trading, said the Dollars 500m bid would be made today to the Netherlands branch of Credit Lyonnais. The proposed takeover vehicle will be a Luxembourg-registered company called The Lion Group SA, which is more than 50 per cent controlled by Mr Di Stefano and has, as a minority shareholder, a company controlled by Mr Cornfeld. The bidders claim to have half the Dollars 500m in cash and the rest in loans from Italian and German banks. Mr Cornfeld spent 11 months in a Swiss jail in 1973 accused of fraud in connection with his Investors Overseas Services (IOS) business. He was acquitted of the charges in 1979. Mr Di Stefano said he spoke last week to a senior executive of Credit Lyonnais and was told 'to come back when the money is lined up'. But Credit Lyonnais said: 'There has been absolutely no contact with Mr Cornfeld and Mr Di Stefano. Their statements are unworthy of any comment by us.' Mr Cornfeld said he was excited at the prospect of attempting his first high-profile transaction in 20 years and he and Mr Di Stefano planned to name themselves as co-chairmen of MGM if the bid succeeds. 'I see this as an opportunity to turn around a major company in the film business. I'll be active in management,' he said.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Today's proposal includes procedures for refunding expended  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> production allowances for controlled substances exported for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transformation or destruction in the final control period. A  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> person who requests additional production allowances for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> controlled substances exported for transformation or destruction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must submit the same information required under the current rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for persons requesting additional consumption allowances in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;82.10(a): <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> _The identities and addresses of the exporter and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recipient of the exports;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _The exporter's Employer Identification Number;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _The names and telephone numbers of contact person for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exporter and recipient;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _The quantity and type of controlled substance exported;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _The source of the controlled substance and the date  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purchased;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _The date on which and port from which the controlled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substances are exported from the United States or its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> territories;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _The country to which the controlled substances were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exported;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _The bill of lading and the invoice indicating the net  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quantity of controlled substances shipped and documenting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the sale of the controlled substances to the purchaser for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> either transformation or destruction;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _The commodity code of the controlled substance exported. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In today's proposal, EPA wishes to accelerate the time when  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exporters of controlled substances to Parties can submit forms  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the ``refund'' of consumption allowances, whether or not the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substance is for transformation or destruction or for an emissive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use. EPA is proposing that exporters submit the current ``Request  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for Additional Consumption Allowances'' form at the initiation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the export of a specific quantity of controlled substance to a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Party rather than wait until a completed bill of lading and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> invoice are prepared. The proposed change accelerates the time  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> taken to grant consumption allowances for exports. EPA proposes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the consumption allowances be granted for the quantity of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> controlled substance exported, with confirmation contingent upon  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> receipt of the bill of lading and invoice. Granting of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consumption allowances will be confirmed upon review of the bill  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of lading and invoice. Such allowances may be used at the time  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> granted, prior to confirmation. In the event, however, that EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determines that the controlled substances are not exported for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whatever reason, then EPA will consider that allowances were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expended by the producer for the production of the controlled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substance and the consumption allowances were never granted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Without the consumption allowances, the producer may have a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> negative balance, at which time the producer will be out of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Reporting and recordkeeping for essential uses. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Today's proposal creates a new category of allowances  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> called essential-use allowances in anticipation of the special  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exemptions that Parties to the Protocol will most likely approve  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for essential-use production after January 1, 1996.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In today's rule, EPA is proposing that the final allocation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of essential-use allowances be published in the final rule based  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the Decisions of the Parties at their meeting in October of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1994. Once the Parties have reached a final Decision in this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> first round of essential-uses designations, EPA will propose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allocations of essential-use allowances that parallel the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specific quantities of a controlled substance for the specific  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> uses as nominated by specific U.S. entities to the Protocol.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA is proposing a system whereby deductions will be made  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from the control period allocations of essential-use allowances  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> based on quarterly reports submitted by producers and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recipient of the essential-use allowances.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The producer or importer of controlled substances for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> essential uses must maintain, under today's proposal, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> following records: (i) The letter conferring the essential-use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allowances from the recipient of the allowances certifying that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the controlled substance will be used only for the specified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> essential-use, and (ii) in the case of essential-use production  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for laboratory or analytical use, a certification from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> laboratories that the quantity of the specific substance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purchased will be used only for laboratory/analytical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applications and will not be resold.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

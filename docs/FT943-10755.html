			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Net asset value drops 17% at TR Pacific Net asset value per share of TR Pacific Investment Trust dropped 17 per cent from 121.2p to 100.4p during the six months to June 30, but compared with 70.85p at end-June 1993. Net revenue fell 27 per cent to Pounds 349,000, against Pounds 480,000, despite gross revenue higher by 12 per cent at Pounds 1.44m. However, this was not sufficient to offset higher management fees and borrowing costs. The trust raised its borrowing facility from Dollars 15m to Dollars 25m (Pounds 16.1m). Earnings per share were 0.26p (0.358p).</p>

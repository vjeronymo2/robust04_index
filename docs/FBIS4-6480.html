			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 16 (KCNA) -- Newspapers here today  dedicate signed articles to the national day of Denmark.    Denmark is developing relations with different countries,  while opposing aggression, war and racism, MINJU CHOSON notes,  and says:    Korea and Denmark are far away from each other  geographically  but their people have established bonds of friendship and are  furthering support and cooperation.    The Korean people believe that the friendly and cooperative  relations between the two countries would further strengthen and  develop in the idea of independence, peace and friendship, and  wish the Danish people fresh success in their work for national  prosperity.

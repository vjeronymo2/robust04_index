			<p>920224 FT  24 FEB 92 / International Company News: CS First Boston returns to health with Dollars 215m net CS FIRST BOSTON, the global investment bank which suffered heavy losses and internal upheaval in 1990, will today underline its return to health by reporting net earnings of Dollars 215m for 1991. The New York-based firm is a subsidiary of Credit Suisse, the Swiss bank, which in 1990 had to launch a financial bail-out for CS First Boston when its Dollars 1.2bn exposure to troubled corporate 'bridge loans' prompted a Wall Street crisis of confidence in First Boston's liquidity. The 1991 profit compares to a loss of Dollars 587m in 1990, when it took provisions against exposure to the bridge loans and the property market, and suffered a difficult trading year and a round of cost-cutting. It made just Dollars 11m in 1989. Last year's figures are broadly in line with sharply increased profits reported by many investment banks, thanks to strong equity and debt markets. However, First Boston may have been more conservative than some rivals in committing funds to trading on its own account, which was a particularly profitable Wall Street activity in 1991. Mr John Hennessy, chief executive, said the group's two biggest operating units - Credit Suisse-First Boston in Europe and First Boston Corporation in the Americas - had contributed roughly equally to profits, with a smaller but positive contribution coming from the group's growing Asian operation. He added that 1992 had got off to a good start, and that January's worldwide results had been 'some of the strongest we have ever recorded'. The upheavals of 1990, including staff cuts or defections and a shrinking balance sheet, led some analysts to question whether First Boston would be able to retain the strength of its franchise as one of the world's pre-eminent investment banks. However, the company points out that 1991 league tables compiled by Securities Data show it placed second in global debt security underwriting, third in global underwriting of common stocks and initial public offerings, and third in global announced merger and acquisition transactions. During the year, its equity capitalisation rose 21 per cent from Dollars 706m to Dollars 858m, while all the company's bridge loans have now been permanently refinanced. It received Dollars 535m in cash last year from the sale of some of these investments.</p>

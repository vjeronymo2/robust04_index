			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / Row over Irish funds A new row has broken out between the Irish government and the European Commission over the allocation of IPounds 7.2bn in EU structural and cohesion funds to Ireland for 1994-99. A team of Commission officials, headed by Mr Eneko Landaburu, the director general for regional policy, arrived in Dublin yesterday for what was expected to be a stormy meeting to discuss Ireland's plans for spending the IPounds 7.2bn under the various operational programme headings. Mr Landaburu has publicly raised questions over Ireland's emphasis on human resource development, for which IPounds 3.1bn is earmarked under Ireland's national development plan for 1994-99, and of which IPounds 1.9bn is to be funded by the EU. Mr Ruari Quinn, Ireland's minister for enterprise and employment, yesterday attacked Mr Landaburu for having publicly criticised Ireland's spending plans in advance of yesterday's meeting. Commission officials said yesterday that 'nobody in the government can have been under any illusion that the plan would be simply rubber-stamped by the commission.' .</p>

			<p>940101 FT  01 JAN 94 / Roll out the barrel for a UK lottery: But the real battles are yet to come Late this year, or early next, Britain's national lottery will start producing millionaire winners, plus geysers of cash for numerous good causes. Peter Brooke, the national heritage secretary, says the lottery's impact on Britain's quality of life will be considerable, and that it may turn into the world's most successful tombola. So it flipping well should, for Britain is staggering into the big-time lottery business very late in the day. Not since 1826 has Britain had a national lottery. In the meantime, large-scale lotteries have sprung up everywhere, bestowing sudden and shocking wealth on thousands of players while raising billions in revenue for state and national governments. In the European Union alone, gambling is reckoned to be a Dollars 40bn-plus business, and new technologies are pushing the frontiers of gambling beyond national borders. Britain's laggardly progress on the lottery front was due to opposition by the football pools promoters, whose lucrative business - based on forecasting the results of football matches - is a form of long-odds gambling closely akin to lotteries. But the case for a UK national lottery distinct from the football pools was always a strong one. And the likelihood is that Britain's overdue debut on the big-time Lotto stage will influence the evolution of international gambling - producing, next century, mega-lotteries for planetary good causes. Britain's national lottery will be job-positive, creating work in the construction, computer and other industries. And costs as a percentage of stakes ought to be excessively slim. Peter Davis, the lottery's director-general, is required by law to drive the hardest possible bargain with the operator. It is his job to ensure that the greatest sum possible is delivered to the recipients - charities, the arts, sport, national heritage and the Millennium Fund to celebrate the year 2000. Moreover, the UK lottery is likely to be mounted and marketed with state-of-the-art skills. Its launch advertising budget will be one of the fattest plums in UK advertising history. And, with a wealth of foreign lottery experience to draw upon, there will be no excuse if Britain's Lotto isn't the most secure and technically advanced operation of its kind. All's well that ends well? Not on your life. The lottery has already generated great quantities of snooty chitter-chatter, and will generate far more. Some stick-in-the-muds are offended that Britain should descend to anything as 'tacky' as a lottery to fund good causes. Kill-joys worry about the social consequences - will it spawn addicts casting money they cannot afford into Lotto's chomping jaws? Some even fret that a big-scale lottery is unfair on the poor, maintaining that the least well-off will be subsidising the cultural pursuits of a prosperous elite. This accusation is particularly woolly-minded. The government says it believes that proceeds of the lottery 'will benefit everyone with an interest in sport, the arts, our heritage, or who benefits from charitable activities.' And it ought to be obvious, even to economists, that if the 'poor' buy most of the tickets, the 'poor' will win most of the prizemoney. The wrangles to come will be more significant. There could well be controversy over the selection of operator, due by the spring. Bids for the seven-year licence must be submitted by February 14. Various blue-chip consortia are readying to bid, and the battle will be intense. But the commercial consortia jostling for the franchise face particularly tricky rivals in Richard Branson, boss of Virgin Atlantic Airways, and Lord Young, chairman of Cable and Wireless, who have formed the UK Lottery Foundation. If the foundation won the franchise, it would hand all its profits to charity. Young and Branson are likely to face at least seven rivals. If one of them scoops the franchise with a less than wholly convincing bid, there could be uproar. Branson has claimed that the public would spend an extra Pounds 1 or Pounds 2 on the lottery per week if they knew that all profits were ear-marked for charity - though he cannot know that. On the other hand, in a letter to the FT eight days ago, Branson wrote: '(A lottery company) is not a particularly entrepreneurial venture. Therefore, the question that needs to be asked is: is it really necessary to add an extra layer of shareholders, over the managers, who can sit back and cream off hundreds of millions of pounds of profit that could otherwise be going to good causes?' Forecasts of the lottery's annual turnover range from about Pounds 2bn to a fanciful Pounds 6bn, with Pounds 3.5bn-Pounds 4bn the most likely once it is into its stride. Half the money will be given out in prizes while the government - greedily - has stated that it will confiscate 12 per cent of turnover in lottery tax, rather than allocate the maximum sum possible to good causes. The operator's expenses and profits will account for about 13 per cent of turnover, leaving about 25 per cent for spending on good causes. The biggest disputes are likely to erupt as soon as the lottery is working and decisions fall due on allocating the proceeds. Think of the non-stop rubbishing that the present-day Arts Council attracts - then multiply by five. For example, a National Lotteries Charities Board will be established to distribute lottery funds to charities, and the Queen is appointing a Millennium Commission to oversee projects marking the turn of the century. The lobbying and the foaming at the mouth likely to break out once those two bodies knuckle down to business may well swamp customary controversies in sporting, arty and heritage circles. In the end, though, Britain's national lottery will prove exciting and successful, spreading cheer to places where cheer was long thought extinct. In turn, the evolution of gambling seems likely to gain pace as the communications revolution unfolds. Eventually, trans-national and global lotteries seem inevitable - planetary tombolas to save the elephant, fight famine, counteract tyranny or buy Italy.</p>

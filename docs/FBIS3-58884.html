Two subjects were at the center of  talks: The implementation and possibly improvement of the 15  December agreement on the Uruguay Round; preparing the  post-Uruguay Round. The Commission repeated the importance it  attached to this last aspect, both for creating the new  Multilateral Trade Organization and the negotiations to envisage  later on "trade and competition" and "trade and the  environment." As for implementing the 15 December agreements,  the EC considers that improvements should still be made to the  offers of certain third countries over market access, be it for  textiles (Asian countries) or financial services (Japan), etc.  In the field of agriculture, it is rather the Community which  is under pressure: Certain third countries are calling for  improvements in its offers. Thus, in the Sutherland-Steichen  talks, there was special mention of:    (a) Chile's request to enlarge its export quota for apples  to  take account of the quantities it traditionally exports to the  Community (114,000 tons instead of 98,000 tons), otherwise Chile  may take the case before a GATT panel;    (b) Australia's request for an increase in its sheep meat  quota, this country claiming to be badly treated compared to New  Zealand;    (c) a problem for Canada regarding the timetable set for the  presentation of improved offers (to 15 February);    (d) the rejection, notably by Guatemala, of the Community  offer for an amicable settlement of the dispute on the EEC's new  rules in the banana sector. The problem of the audiovisual  sector was not explicitly discussed during Mr. Sutherland's  talks in Brussels, however, it continues to be the source of  controversy between the EC and the United States. Mr. Kantor's  view is that the lack of a specific arrangement in the Uruguay  Round means that current GATT rules apply, and the United States  plans to attack EC policy (in particular limits on the broadcast  of non-European programs under the TV without frontiers  directive). The United States could respond to these  restrictions, which it considers unlawful, with retaliation  measures. In contrast, for Mr. Delors, the matter has been  settled in that the parties can apply their own rules and the  matter will not be reexamined. Sources close to Sir Leon  Brittan limit their observations to saying that it would not be  easy for the United States to prove injury as a result of the  European policy before the GATT, since American audiovisual  works account for 70-80 percent of the Community market.</p>

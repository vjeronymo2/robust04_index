			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / World Trade News: Bush faces clash over China THE US Senate is heading for a further confrontation with President Bush after a vote yesterday to impose conditions next year on China's Most Favoured Nation status. The House has already passed legislation to renew China's MFN status - which provides the lowest tariffs possible - only on condition it improves human rights and trade behaviour and adheres to curbs on missile and nuclear exports. The House is expected to muster the two-thirds vote it needs to override a veto. Senators yesterday passed a similar measure by a voice vote, leaving in doubt the number of senators prepared to go against the president. Meanwhile, US trade officials were yesterday continuing talks in Beijing on market access. With the China merchandise trade surplus likely to exceed Dollars 15bn (Pounds 7.6bn) this year, the Bush administration badly wants a victory at the negotiating table to restrain the forces seeking to impose conditions on MFN. Alternatively, the president can impose sanctions on up to Dollars 3.9bn in goods if no agreement on access is reached with China before October 10.</p>

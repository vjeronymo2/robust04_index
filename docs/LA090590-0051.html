			<p><P> September 5, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOLMES A COURT FAMILY KEEPING U.K. THEATERS;  </P> <P> STAGE: DESPITE ANNOUNCEMENT, SPECULATION GROWS ABOUT FATE OF 13 HIGHLY PRIZED  WEST END PROPERTIES.  </P> <P> The group of 13 West End theaters left by Australian businessman Robert Holmes  a Court -- including the Theater Royal Drury Lane, where the smash musical  "Miss Saigon" is running -- will remain under family control, his company said  Tuesday.  </P> <P> But despite the announcement, speculation continued here over the future of the  group, Stoll Moss Theaters, which owns about 25% of the commercial stages in  London's "theaterland."  </P> <P> The theaters are part of the widespread holdings of Holmes a Court, who died  early Sunday of a heart attack at his home in Australia. His widow, Janet, and  oldest son, Peter, will now become the major shareholders in the family  company, Heytesbury Holdings.  </P> <P> Rumors have been swirling through London's theater world that one or another of  Holmes a Court's rivals might swoop in to grab some of his historic West End  jewels. Louis Benjamin, former president of Stoll Moss, told Britain's Daily  Telegraph that within hours of hearing that Holmes a Court had died, he had  been asked to join two separate consortiums that wanted to buy the theater  group. He would not name them, but said one was British and the other American.  </P> <P> There also has been speculation that members of Holmes a Court's management  team might attempt a buyout. Besides owning the Drury Lane, the West End's  largest commercial theater, Stoll Moss holdings include the legendary  Palladium, where "Show Boat" is having a successful run, and Her Majesty's,  where "The Phantom of the Opera" is thriving.  </P> <P> While neither Heytesbury nor Stoll Moss would place a value on the theater  group, outside estimates have run between $117 million and $146 million.  </P> <P> David Kiernan, finance director of Chesterfield Properties, which owns six West  End theaters, said he did not have "the faintest" idea what the Stoll Moss  group might be worth, but added that $146 million "seems like a lot to me." But  he, along with other industry observers, agreed that ownership of certain  theaters carries great prestige and could boost the value in unpredictable  ways.  </P> <P> "It's like owning certain prestige hotels, such as the Dorchester or the Ritz,"  said Rebecca Munns, an analyst with W.I. Carr in London.  </P> <P> Chesterfield has made no moves toward attempting to buy the Stoll Moss  theaters, Kiernan said. But the company might be interested in buying pieces of  the collection if they were to be sold individually.  </P> <P> "It would depend on which ones and how much they were asking," Kiernan said.  </P> <P> Said Munns, "One wonders whether (composer Andrew) Lloyd Webber might be  interested in owning more theaters."  </P> <P> The business relationship between Lloyd Webber and Holmes a Court had not been  pleasant. Earlier this year, at a time when the composer was trying to buy back  shares to take his company private, the Australian had increased his holdings  in Lloyd Webber's Really Useful Group to 6.6%.  </P> <P> It is widely assumed in the West End that Holmes a Court purchased his minority  stake in RUG with plans to force Lloyd Webber to sell him the spectacular  Palace theater, where "Les Miserables" is running.  </P> <P> Holmes a Court's Heytesbury company said it still has no plans to sell its RUG  holdings. A spokesman for the Really Useful Group said Tuesday that Lloyd  Webber is still interested in buying back the shares and will probably take  some action soon.  </P> <P> Theater owners earn most of their income by splitting ticket sales with  producers; in most cases the producer gets 60% with the theater owner getting  40%.  </P> <P> Stoll Moss itself, however, had recently begun investing in some shows and  therefore began taking a larger percentage of the box office, said Peter  Hepple, editor of the London trade paper The Stage. "They sometimes get a 50-50  split or even 40-60," he said.  </P></p>

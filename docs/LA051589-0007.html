			<p><P> May 15, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE;  </P> <P> BABY SNATCHED FROM HOSPITAL  </P> <P> Sacramento police are seeking a 200-pound woman with streaked orange and black  hair who kidnaped a 3-day-old boy from his mother's hospital room the day  before Mother's Day. The "terribly distraught" mother went home from Sutter  Memorial Hospital shortly after her new baby was stolen from his crib when she  left her room briefly while getting ready to be discharged, authorities said.  Police hunted for the missing infant and his abductor, who posed as a staff  volunteer at the hospital in a white smock with a hospital badge and may have  waited for the baby to be born to steal him. "In 52 years and 50,000 births,  this kind of thing has never happened here," said a hospital spokeswoman. "It's  a real sad incident."  </P></p>

			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / Rebuilding work helps Lebanese economy to 8% growth rate Lebanon's economy has recovered from this year's faltering start and is on course to reach government targets of 8 per cent a year growth, according to Banque de Liban, Lebanon's central bank. However, real wages remain depressed, prompting protests from labour and other groups, while economists say sustained high interest rates continue to tempt repatriated funds into Lebanese town treasury bills rather than productive direct investment. Economists at Banque Audi, the commercial bank which is among the first to publish detailed economic data, said that, after reaching 7 per cent in 1993, growth in the Lebanese economy slipped back in the first quarter, recovering only in the second to raise real growth rates during the first half of 1994 to 7.9 per cent. The bank forecasts real growth of 8-10 per cent for 1994 as a whole. Mr Riad Salame, the central bank governor, said: 'From our data, the economy went through a slowdown from August 1993 to April 1994, but has been recovering since May. July and August have been particularly good months.' However, both Mr Salame and other economists warned that there were few reliable figures on the economy since the end of Lebanon's civil war three years ago. Lebanon's reconstituted central statistical department only recently published its first economic data since 1974. Growth estimates are therefore based on a mix of monetary aggregates, indices such as cement sales, the award of construction permits, port and airport traffic and some industrial and agricultural data. Construction, in particular, has remained strong, with the latest central bank monthly bulletin showing cement deliveries and construction permits in July up 35 and 20 per cent respectively over the same month last year. However, the bulletin also said: 'Excess supply on the real estate market has resulted in large inventories of unsold dwellings.' The bulletin said foreign trade remained sluggish, with imports and exports down 19 and 14 per cent respectively in July from a year earlier. But it said the trade deficit fell by 20 per cent in July after widening by 10 per cent in the first half. The balance of payments recorded an overall deficit of Dollars 27m due largely to an exceptional Dollars 135m transfer overseas by Solidere, the property company established by Arab investors this year. But the bulletin also said strong capital inflows and revived tourism had produced an underlying surplus of Dollars 107m. The bank said balance of payments surpluses had averaged Dollars 80m a month since February. Mr Salame said about Dollars 10bn had flowed into Lebanon since the end of the war in 1990, the bulk of it repatriated Lebanese capital and Gulf Arab funds. Of this, he said, about Dollars 6bn went into Lebanese bank deposits and most of the rest into Lebanese pound treasury bills. He said Dollars 3bn had flowed in during the past year, half into T-bills. With T-bill rates hovering at around 19 per cent, economists said these would continue to attract significant inflows of cash and interest rates look set to remain high in real terms - with domestic inflation at 10 per cent a year - while the government endeavoured to keep the Lebanese pound stable at about Pounds L1660-1680 to the dollar in an effort to 'de-dollarise' one of the Middle East's most dollarised economies. 'We obviously need to have more money flow into productive investment,' Mr Salame said. 'But we don't yet have the proper infrastructure in place to attract capital into these sectors.' He said substantially greater flows of productive investment were unlikely until the completion of some of the multi-billion-dollar infrastructure projects under way and the revival of Lebanon's capital markets as an effective investment intermediary. So far this market comprises only domestic T-bills and a secondary market in Solidere shares, which have soared from their issue price of Dollars 100 to Dollars 170 in recent weeks. A stock market committee has been reappointed and is discussing regulatory changes necessary for the revival of a fully fledged Beirut stock market. Mr Salame said he believed the market could begin operations within months, with as many as 10 previously listed companies being traded. However, the fruits of Lebanon's economic growth are proving slow to trickle down to the bulk of middle- and lower-class workers in the country, whose cause has recently been taken up by labour unions and political leaders in a string of attacks on government economic policies and their reconstruction priorities. The General Confederation of Lebanese Workers this week said it was seeking a retroactive pay rise of 88 per cent to compensate for recent price rises and the decline in real wages. But Mr Salame said that, while the government realised real wages had fallen, it would resist such pay rises unless they were matched by increased productivity. He said the government was concerned above all to contain the inflationary effects of the recent spurt in economic activity, much of it spurred by the recent award of a host of large infrastructure contracts.</p>

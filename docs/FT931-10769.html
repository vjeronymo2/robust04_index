			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Armour falls 8% to Pounds 0.83m IN SPITE OF an 8 per cent downturn in half year pre-tax profits to Pounds 830,000, Armour Trust, the confectionery and automotive group, is lifting its interim dividend from 0.315p to 0.3465p. The news accompanied a statement revealing that Grand Central Investment Holdings, the chocolate maker with interests in the Asia-Pacific region, had increased its shareholding in Armour from 4.85m ordinary to 6.57m ordinary, representing 24.1 per cent of the issued share capital. The figures for the half year to October 31 reflected a sharp downturn in trade following the pound's devaluation in September. That affected trade in October and November, the key trading months for the group. Turnover rose to Pounds 12.34m, an improvement of 9 per cent over last time's Pounds 11.34m. Sales for December and January were above last year's levels and February had started 'very positively'. Business had 'definitely improved' in export markets.</p>

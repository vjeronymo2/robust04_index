			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): EC job opportunities surveyed MANAGERS and technical staff will be the categories of people with most opportunities to work in other European countries next year, according to a survey of more than 200 Scottish employers. The research, part of a project on the implications of the single European market for vocational education and training, found that 40 per cent of staff recruited from other EC countries filled either management or technical posts. The report, to be published shortly in the Industrial Relations Journal, found that 50 per cent of employers surveyed believed the completion of the single market next year would make no difference to recruitment and that they were satisfied with local labour. A substantial minority, 45 per cent, believed recruitment would be affected. That view is widely held by larger companies, those with more than 100 employees. Researchers say larger companies are likely to have a better understanding of the European labour market. A third of companies had employed staff from other EC countries. The largest companies (those with more than 500 employees) and those with EC links are most likely to recruit staff from other EC countries. Expanding business with the country concerned was cited by 20 per cent of employers as the reason for recruiting staff from other EC countries. More than 50 per cent of companies in service industries expected to recruit staff from other EC countries, compared with 40 per cent in manufacturing and construction.

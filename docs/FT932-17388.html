			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Tories defend council costs THE Conservative campaign for the county council elections next month would be based squarely on the proposition that Tory councils cost less, Sir Norman Fowler, the party chairman said yesterday. Opening the campaign, Sir Norman and Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary, responded directly to Labour's claim on Tuesday that average council tax bills under Labour councils were Pounds 14 less than under Tory councils, by publishing their own figures. The average council tax bill for a two-person household would be Pounds 456, Mr Howard said, compared with Pounds 486 per home under the poll tax and Pounds 514 under the rates four years ago. The figure is an arithmetic average, and Mr Howard acknowledged that it was affected by the increase in government grant paid for by a rise in Value Added Tax to soften the poll tax and also by the tight government control on local spending. The Tories argue that Labour's figures simply reflect the fact that Labour-controlled areas tend to have lower property prices. The true comparison, they say, is between the tax levied on houses of equivalent value. On that basis the average council tax for a band C property (Pounds 52,000-Pounds 68,000) under Conservative councils is Pounds 456 compared with Pounds 563 for a band C property under Labour. Sir Norman promised that the Tory campaign would be better than it was in 1989, but was cautious in making predictions about the number of councillors and councils the party might gain. In 1989 the Conservatives made net gains of just under 100 seats and took the number of the 47 counties in England and Wales it controlled to 18. Then, however, the Liberals and the Social Democrats were self-destructing. The centre-ground will be more fiercely contested this time.</p>

			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / BT shares sale to help fund public sector spending: Sell-off forms part of aim to raise Pounds 5.5bn A NEW sale of BT shares was announced yesterday by Chancellor Norman Lamont who gave notice of a 'major sale' of shares in the 1993-94 financial year to help fund government spending plans. The government also signalled its intention to push ahead with plans to introduce tolls on trunk roads and motorways in an attempt to attract private sector investment. Both announcements were aimed at explaining how the government would keep spending within its limit of Pounds 244.5bn. They follow Mr Lamont's implicit warning to the Commons Treasury committee on Monday that tax rises, or further spending cuts, could not be ruled out if the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement failed to move towards balance over the economic cycle. The new BT share sale is part of the government's plans, announced last week, to raise Pounds 5.5bn from privatisation over the coming year and a similar sum in 1994-95. Speaking at the start of a two-day Commons debate on the Autumn Statement, Mr Lamont said business now had the best chance in years to exploit low interest rates, low taxes and low inflation and a 15 per cent devaluation 'to invest, to export and to build for the future'. But his upbeat presentation received short shrift from Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor. He described the Autumn Statement as 'complacent' in failing to address unemployment and business bankruptcies or to offer a coherent long-term strategy for reviving industrial investment. The government's remaining 22 per cent BT shareholding is worth Pounds 5.4bn at last night's closing price of 396p. The government has already sold two tranches of shares in the company. The first was in 1984, with the second coming last December. Ministers have yet to decide how many BT shares to sell or when they will be marketed. They hope to appoint a financial adviser, global co-ordinator and lead stockbroker early next month. About 10 investment banks and brokers were yesterday sent letters from the Treasury inviting them to tender for the roles. SG Warburg undertook all three roles during the last issue. BT last night welcomed the announcement: 'It removes the fear, however unfounded, that a government might be tempted to interfere with BT's management processes at some stage in the future.' The sale will be offered to both retail and institutional investors. Retail investors will be offered an inducement to buy shares. Last time they received a 45p discount on the 350p price paid by institutions. The Treasury plans to develop last year's use of 'share shops' to promote its goal of wider share ownership, although investment bankers are sceptical of the value of this approach. The Treasury is confident that there will still be an appetite for BT shares because its current share price is 13 per cent higher that the 350p at which they were sold on December 9. Over the same period the FT-SE 100 share index has also risen by 13 per cent. Lex, Page 24 London Shares, Page 44</p>

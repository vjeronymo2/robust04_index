			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / Arts: Almeida Concerts THE concerts of contemporary music fitted around the three productions of the first incarnation of Almeida Opera, at the Almeida Theatre, London N1, have given useful breadth and variety to the season. The idea of relating these programmes to the operas has been generally successful, and only occasionally strained. As a template for future seasons it seems eminently flexible. The evening devoted to 'Musica Transalpina', tracing the Italianate influence into northern Europe as a corollary to the production of Stephen Oliver's Mario and the Magician, brought one important revival - a performance by Music Projects under Richard Bernas of The Deluge, Alexander Goehr's 1959 setting of da Vinci. It is a toughly argued, sinewy piece, with intense vocal writing for the soprano and mezzo soloists. But 30 years on it seems curiously fixed in its time, holding its passionate lyricism under tight control. The remainder of the Music Projects programme was mixed - a beautifully idiomatic account of Schoenberg's Serenade (still though a work that never fails to outstay its welcome), and a poised, neat version of Donatoni's exquisite Arpege. There was a dutiful premiere of some new Michael Finnissy: Various Nations was commissioned by Almeida Opera, yet turned out to be a curiously perfunctory piece. A narrator (Eleanor Bron here) delivers readings from a Victorian children's geography book, full of hilarious colonial condescension, while the ensemble runs through a sequence of suitably ethnic pastiches. One waits to be surprised, but the expected musical twist or sting never happens, and the piece fizzles out tamely and without consequence. Sunday's closing concerts were given by the Bergen-based ensemble BIT 20. The early-evening programme promised two British premieres, of Kaija Saariaho's gravely beautiful Lichtbogen and Arne Nordheim's emptily rhetorical Tre Voci. But neither was new to this country; Almeida Opera's programme book seems to have inherited its predecessor's piratical claims to first performances.</p>

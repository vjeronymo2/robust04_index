			<p>920729 FT  29 JUL 92 / Arts: Today's Television BBC2's Screenplay at 9.00 is 'Man to Man', a one woman monologue by Manfred Karge, which was first admired as a stage play. Tilda Swinton, an accomplished actress who seems doomed to play male characters, is the German housewife who, to survive in Nazi Germany, takes on her husband's identity after his death and plays out the role for over 40 years. Anyone who thinks that all Jackie Collins' sex and shopping novels read the same will be unsurprised that two of them, Lucky and Chances, have been merged into one mini series which starts on ITV at 9.00 and sprawls over much of the next two nights to provide six hours of escapist viewing. Mind you they share a heroine, Lucky, a gangster's daughter. Collins, upset at unsympathetic adaptations of her work, has written the screenplay and produced this tale of passion, power and greed. Has the demise of the Soviet Union left the CIA without a role? Not according to its new director, Robert Gates, who maps out a future for himself heading an Agency that ferrets out data on narcotics, terrorists and nuclear proliferation. (BBC 1, 9.30).</p>

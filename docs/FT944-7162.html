			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: European potato prices double as production falls to five-year low European potato prices have doubled in recent months as production has fallen to its lowest level for five years, according to a survey by the UK's Potato Marketing Board. Output for 1994 is forecast to be 5m tonnes lower than last year at 42.3m tonnes following dry weather in the summer growing season. The drop in production and poor quality of part of the crop has taken prices in the Netherlands to the equivalent of Pounds 185 to Pounds 192 a tonne for processing quality potatoes - up from Pounds 55 a tonne last year. The board's provisional figures show that all European Union countries have seen a drop in production except for Ireland, Spain and Greece. The dry weather also affected quality of 40 per cent of the crop in the Netherlands, Belgium and parts of France. Quality problems could lead to an even greater reduction in the crop as potatoes fail to meet storage standards. Potato traders estimate that some 5m tubers could fail quality tests. In France, prices have doubled to Pounds 118 a tonne from the same period last year and in the UK the average price has increased to Pounds 146 a tonne from Pounds 69 a tonne in November 1993. 'Consumers are likely to see some increase in price, but we don't know how much of these rises will be passed on and potato consumption is not usually affected by higher prices as they are regarded as staples,' said Ms Diana Rees at the PMB. Potato futures prices have soared indicating traders' expectation that wholesale prices will increase further. Futures prices in the Netherlands are showing a price of Pounds 320 a tonne for April delivery. Britain's crop has not been so badly affected by the drought as almost half the production area is irrigated, against 30 per cent on the continent. Germany has been hit particularly hard with output falling from 12.3m tonnes last year to 9.3m tonnes.</p>

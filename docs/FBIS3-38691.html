Twenty fishing vessels sealed off the major French port,  immobilising three freighters inside while a ferry from Plymouth  was forced to wait offshore.    Fishing boats from Honfleur across the Seine estuary  meanwhile blocked the entrance to the river and the inland port  at Rouen.    The Havre fishermen complained they would not get "one cent"  of aid promised by French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur in  negotiations Friday with Brittany fishermen in Rennes, the  Brittany capital. [passage omitted]    In the Mediterranean port of Marseille, more than a tonne of  fish from Algeria and Senegal was held up by health inspectors  who said the catches did not have the right documents.    On Thursday, French authorities ordered stricter checks on  imported fish as protestors blamed imports for a collapse in  prices.</p>

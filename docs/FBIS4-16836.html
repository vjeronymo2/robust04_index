			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Sergey Oleynik] </F>   [Text] St. Petersburg April 19 TASS -- The third annual  meeting of the board of the European Bank for Reconstruction and  Development has ended in St. Petersburg after being attended by  representatives of 59 states and international  organizations-bank shareholders.    The bank managers approved bank activities of 1993 and set  future priorities.    Bank President Jacques de Larosiere told the final news  conference he is satisfied with the meeting results. The bank's  adherence to the development of the private sector was  unanimously supported. Special attention will be paid to the  assistance to small and medium ventures. Bank-supported  projects to help private businesses will be a major sphere of  the bank activities.    The bank board has decided to expand its activities in all  the 25 post-communist nations in 1994. Each of them will have  at least one project. At the same time, Russia will remain the  major area of bank operations, said de Larosiere.    Bank credits issued to the Russian Federation increased  tenfold in 1993. Russia counts for over 20 projects worth of  1.5 billion ECU [European currency units] from out of the bank's  150 investment projects worth of 3.5 billion ecu. The actual  sum of the credit use is so far 120 million U.S. dollars.    Financing of environmental protection projects remains a  priority area of the bank's activities. The bank head noted  they will pay more attention to safety of nuclear reactors and  have reached an agreement on additional allocations for reactor  upgrading projects. Three Russian projects of the kind are being  discussed.    Another important result of the bank board meeting is the  decision to help central and east European plants to enter world  markets. Free goods exports is an obligatory condition for  their transition to the market economy, stressed de Larosiere.    The bank's 1993 successes, expanded activities and more  complicated tasks have raised the question of increased funds,  which are amounting to ten billion ecu in accordance with the  bank rules.    In the words of de Larosiere, corresponding proposals will  be  prepared by the bank leadership by the fourth annual meeting of  the bank board to be held on April 10-11, 1995, in London.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Bulgarian Minister of Defense Valentin </F> Aleksandrov by Sevda Shishmanova on 10 January; place not given  -- recorded]    [Text] [Announcer] Our reporter Sevda Shishmanova asked  Bulgaria's Defense Minister Valentin Aleksandrov about his views  on the latest initiative of the NATO leaders at their summit in  Brussels.    [Aleksandrov] The Partnership for Peace lays the foundation  for the European armed forces' integration.    [Shishmanova] Yes, but it does not provide any guarantees  for our defense.    [Aleksandrov] Look here, guarantees can be provided (?only  by the state institutions). There are no other guarantees. Who  is going to attack us? Greece, Turkey, or Romania? You must  realize yourself that this is preposterous. This cannot happen.    [Shishmanova] Nevertheless, there is a war, in Yugoslavia.    [Aleksandrov] The Army can cope with this. You should  understand that guarantees of the kind that the Soviet Union  used to provide can no longer be obtained. There is no one to  provide them.    [Shishmanova] Perhaps NATO.    [Aleksandrova] Whom should it provide guarantees for?    [Shishmanova] Evidently, not for us.    [Aleksandrova] Yes, evidently not for us, (?hence we should  adopt other models).    [Shishmanova] In that case, what is the Partnership for  Peace doing for us?    [Aleksandrov] It is a serious [words indistinct] for our  defense. [several words indistinct] The so-called Visegard Four  member-states are not pleased, because they will not join NATO  before us.    [Shishmanova] Yes, but Clinton is expected to meet their  leaders, rather than ours.    [Aleksandrov] This is Clinton's business, it is none of my  concern. I am neither president, nor prime minister, I am  minister of defense. However, I must tell you frankly my point  of view, which I have repeatedly stated, namely that none of  those countries is ahead of us, and I should point out that we  see considerable opportunities in the NATO program that we  intend to take full advantage of.</p>

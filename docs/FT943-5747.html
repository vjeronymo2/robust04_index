			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / Property: Deceptive appearances - A look at apparent anomalies in Hong Kong's market Hong Kong's property market would appear to be full of anomalies. In the past three years, strong demand from multinationals, eager to secure a footing in the British colony as a bridgehead to the lucrative China market, has sent property prices spiralling 200 per cent. Yet only last month property developers watched with incredulity as a plot of land was withdrawn from government auction after it failed to attract bids. Two other sites were snapped up at the opening bids, creating the quietest auction many Hong Kong analysts could recall. The last time the government withdrew a plot was in 1984. At the same time, some 10 floors of the Lippo Centre, a gleaming twin tower block formerly owned by Australian entrepreneur Alan Bond, are lying empty, says property consultants Brooke Hillier Parker. In the six months to end-August rents for central office space rose 18.8 per cent to an average HKDollars 93.40 per square foot. In any other market these examples would reasonably be interpreted as signs of an ailing market. But not, it seems, in Hong Kong. The empty offices in the Lippo Building present a welcome dilemma for the owners (a mix of local Hong Kong Chinese and mainland Chinese): whether to lease at yields of 10 per cent, or to sell for a book profit of at least HKDollars 5,000 a sq ft. The offices would sell for between HKDollars 13,000 and HKDollars 18,000 per sq ft. The disappointing auction, which saw Citic Pacific, a Beijing-controlled diversified conglomerate, walk off with two bargain sites after making the only bids of the day, may primarily have been a reflection of developers' anger over an Independent Commission Against Corruption investigation into alleged corrupt practices at an auction on May 26; poorer quality sites and a mood of caution also contributed to the disappointing response. Mr Peter Churchouse, managing director of Morgan Stanley Asia, said: 'I am fairly convinced this (the auction) is not reflective of the property market in Hong Kong, or of where the market is heading. 'That auction was not about the property market. It was about the bad blood between the developers and the government. Citic got a steal. This is about making points. It's about power.' His assertion - denied by developers, who instead grumbled that the opening bids had been set too high - stems also from the tension between developers and the government since March, when Mr Chris Patten, governor, announced his intention to cool the overheating property market. Since then, according to the government, property prices have fallen by 10-30 per cent. The slump was sufficient to prompt the government - just two days after the previous month's embarrassing auction - to call a halt on any further talk of intervention in the market. The price fall, says the government, was the result of measures announced in June, in particular the clampdown on the re-sale of pre-sale flats before completion. At the same time local interest rates rose in response to a hike in US levels while banks tightened mortgage lending restrictions. The Hong Kong market, say analysts, defies the conventional definition of a market. Indeed Mr Archie Hart, head of research at broker Crosby Securities, says the colony's market does not strictly deserve the name of market, as demand is artificially constrained by the banks, which cap loans, and supply is limited by the government, which sells off limited parcels throughout the year. 'At the moment it looks like this situation will continue. There is no avalanche of new supply coming on stream and equally the banks are saying the 70 per cent (loan to value) limit (for mortgages) could become a way of life rather than a temporary thing.' Government intervention could, too, remain a feature of the market in the short-term, as indicated by the ICAC investigation into the ways auctions are conducted - a probe prompted by the controversial May 26 auction. The taskforce carrying out the review recently returned from a fact-finding mission to Singapore, from where the idea of a tender system is likely to be imported. Under this system, where developers are obliged to provide infras-tructure - road links or sewage - they would tender rather than bid at auction for land plots. While the mood of caution provoked by the June measures is likely to continue, anecdotal evidence suggests activity is returning to the market. The number of new loans approved but not yet taken up increased in July, while residential property transactions rose by between 10 per cent and 15 per cent last month. This evidence of activity suggests the recent low prices achieved at auctions were aberrations - or political posturing - rather than the signal for a toppling market.</p>

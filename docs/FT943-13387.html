			<p>940720 FT  20 JUL 94 / OECD Employment Outlook: Effect of labour standards may be small In one of its most politically controversial passages, the employment outlook hints that the attempt to harmonise labour regulation through the social dimension of the European Union is superfluous. 'It may be argued that labour standards do not have much influence on external competitiveness and trade performance, and thus harmonisation of labour standards is not necessary,' says the report. But it adds: 'However, it is too early to reach this conclusion: considerably more empirical work is called for.' Overall the special chapter on 'social dumping' - the downward pressure on employment conditions to improve competitiveness - finds there is little evidence for its existence in association with more open world trade. It does, however, warn that it could become an issue, especially in trading blocs such as the European Union, which intend to merge their currencies. 'If exchange rates are unified there is a risk that countries may resort to 'social devaluations' to improve competitiveness, to the detriment of other member countries,' says the report. The chapter also finds: There has been a general convergence towards lighter labour market regulation (with the exception of some southern European economies) throughout the OECD area; The degree of government intervention in the determination of labour standards appears to have little effect on either wage rates or trade performance; There is, however, some evidence that inflows of foreign direct investment have been larger in countries where labour costs are lower and government regulations less stringent. On the liberalisation trend of the 1980s the report says that enterprises enjoy increased freedom on working time, on flexible employment contracts and on minimum wages but it is unclear whether this trend is the result of economic integration, or whether other factors such as technological change or unemployment are just as important. The report states that real earnings actually grew faster in countries where regulations were weakened in the recent past, and finds no evidence of a correlation between levels of regulation and per capita GDP and wages. On the other hand there is little evidence to show that countries with less stringent regulations have performed better in terms of trade. The chapter includes an OECD index which attempts to measure the stringency of labour standards, with low marks for low regulation and vice versa. The US and UK both score zero, with Greece the most regulated with 8 points followed by Italy, Spain and Sweden all on 7. The chapter concludes: 'There is no compelling evidence that working conditions have worsened in OECD countries as a result of greater trade openness.'</p>

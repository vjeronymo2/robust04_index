The Committee provides a critical forum for distinguished representatives of diverse industry sectors to present their views on major issues involving commercial operations of the Customs Service. These views are offered directly to senior Treasury and Customs officials on a regular basis in a candid atmosphere. There exists no other single body that serves a comparable function. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> In the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 (Pub. L. 100&hyph;203), Congress repealed the statutory mandate for a Customs User Fee Advisory Committee and directed the Secretary of the Treasury to create a new Advisory Committee on Commercial Operations of the U.S. Customs Service. The original Committee consisted of 20 members drawn broadly from industry sectors affected by Customs commercial operations. The Committee's charter was filed on October 17, 1988 and expired two years later. A new charter was filed on October 17, 1990, renewing the Committee for an additional two-year term. A third charter was filed on October 15, 1992, renewing the Committee for another two-year term, and the Committee has met quarterly thereafter. The current term of the Committee will end with the expiration of the current chapter on October 15, 1994. The Treasury Department plans to file a new charter by that date renewing the Committee for a fourth two-year term. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=2 --> Objectives, Scope and Description of the Committee <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The Committee's objectives are to advise the Secretary of the Treasury on issues relating to the commercial operations of the Customs Service. It is expected that, during its third two-year term, the Committee will consider such issues as implementation of the Customs Modernization Act, the North American Free Trade Agreement, and the recent GATT agreement; user fees; administration of staff and resources for commercial operations; commercial and trade enforcement; impact of Customs commercial operations on ports and carriers; automated systems; Customs reorganization; and the President's ``reinvention of government'' initiative. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Committee will be chaired by the Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Enforcement. The Committee will function for a two-year period before renewal or abolishment and will meet approximately eight times (quarterly) during the period. An additional special meeting of the full Committee or a subcommittee thereof may be convened if necessary. The meetings will generally be held in the Treasury Department, Washington, DC. However, typically one meeting per year, but generally not more than two, may be held outside of Washington at a Customs port. In recent years, meetings have been held in New York, San Diego, Miami, Buffalo, El Paso, and Chicago. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The members shall be selected by the Secretary of the Treasury from representatives of the trade or transportation community serviced by Customs, the general public, or others who are directly affected by Customs commercial operations. In addition, members shall represent major regions of the country, and not more than ten members may be affiliated with the same political party. No person who is required to register under the Foreign Agents Registration Act as an agent or representative of a foreign principal may serve on an advisory committee. Members shall not be paid compensation nor shall they be considered Federal Government employees for any purpose. No per diem, transportation, or other expenses are reimbursed for the cost of attending Committee meetings at any location. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Members who are serving on the Committee during its expiring two-year term are eligible to reapply for membership. A new application letter and updated resume are required. It is expected that approximately half of the current membership of the Committee will be replaced with new appointees. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Membership on the Committee is personal to the appointee. Under the Committee By-laws, a member may not send an alternate to represent him at a Committee meeting. However, since Committee meetings are open to the public, another person from a member's organization may attend and observe the proceedings in a nonparticipating capacity. Regular attendance is essential; a member who is absent for two consecutive meetings or two meetings in a calender year shall lose his seat on the Committee. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=2 --> Application for Advisory Committee Appointment <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Any interested person wishing to serve on the Treasury Advisory Committee on Commercial Operations of the U.S. Customs Service must provide the following: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=2 --> _Statement of interest and reasons for application; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Complete professional biography or resume; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Political affiliation, in order to ensure balanced representation.

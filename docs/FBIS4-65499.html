			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with President Richard von Weizsaecker by </F> unidentified correspondent in Berlin; date not given: "Building  Bridges Instead of Digging Trenches"]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [STERN] The most important  event of your term of office was Germany's unification. Did not  something go wrong?    [Weizsaecker] I would like to mention two things right at  the beginning: First, our foreign policy's speedy, responsible,  and successful seizing of the historic opportunity and, second,  my conviction that, despite all the difficulties and mistakes  regarding the need for financial resources and time, we will, in  the end, successfully solve the great task of unification.    At the beginning it looked as if only the Germans in the  east  had problems. Now the west, too, is struggling for jobs, just  to mention the most important example. It was difficult enough  for the eastern Germans to learn that they had to change their  way of thinking day by day. Now the western Germans, too, must  learn something. This brings us closer together.    In my view, there was one clear mistake. In winter 1989-90  there was widespread and profound readiness in the west for  solidarity and material sacrifice, which was, unfortunately, not  made use of. Instead, the state financed the enormous transfers  preferably through gigantic debts. It is very difficult today  to cope with this.    The community spirit of the citizens, which in a democracy  is  so vital and does not make itself felt so often, unfortunately  did not encounter an active political partner.    [STERN] Did unification not take place in the style of an  occupation?    [Weizsaecker] Large supermarkets with western goods, banks,  and political parties, looking for votes....    [STERN] ....marched into the eastern laender.    [Weizsaecker] No. Of course, this was not done militarily.  However, everybody was looking for his own advantage, just as is  done on the market and among competing parties. There is no  point in criticizing this. The people in the east want the  market economy instead of the old, mismanaged state economy.  However, they do not want to see their entire life, with its  values and goals, defined overnight by the strength of their  elbows or by prices. In addition, of course, they wanted  pluralism in terms of party policy instead of the coercion of a  single party. And this cannot be had without competition for  power. However, the struggle should be conducted visibly for a  better solution of the problems and not just for power for the  sake of power. One must also mention the unfortunate issue of  property. The Germans in the east read in our constitution that  property entails obligations. Many of them, however, think that  in practice property only entails rights. How can one harmonize  the two legitimate sides of this matter?    [STERN] Today prominent Christian Democratic Union/Christian  Social Union politicians disparage Bonn's policy of detente in  the 1970's and 1980's as collaboration with the GDR regime. You  yourself have always been an advocate of this policy and were  actively involved in it.    [Weizsaecker] I was and still am convinced that two things  had to be linked: A firm attitude above any doubt by the West,  on the one hand, and a clear and credible policy of detente on  the other. If today we are sometimes confronted with the bold  theory that the policy of detente prevented or at least delayed  unification because it contributed to consolidating and  prolonging a long ailing system, this is historical nonsense.    [STERN] In 1983 you were the first mayor of West Berlin to  talk to Erich Honecker. Then in 1987 you received him on an  official visit in Bonn. Do you regret shaking his hand?    [Weizsaecker] No. In particular as mayor of Berlin I, like  my predecessors, considered it our special task to make the  division more bearable for the people while it existed. In  particular here in Berlin, in the divided city, everyone could  see every day that our political command was to make the inhuman  wall more permeable and to humanize the cruel border regime.  Therefore, it was our duty to talk to the people who were in  power on the other side. I do not regret it at all that I did  that.    [STERN] GDR politicians such as Modrow or Berghofer, who  helped to ensure that the upheaval happened without bloodshed,  are politically degraded now. Do you think this is right?    [Weizsaecker] Even peaceful revolutions bring about human  injustice and wrong generalized judgments. In many states of  the former Soviet sphere of influence we are today cooperating  with old communists, who essentially contributed to the reforms  at some time or other for more or less ethical reasons.    The course of the upheaval gave us no opportunity to find  out  to what extent there were similar serious reform forces in the  Socialist Unity Party of Germany [SED]. However, I would like  to recall that some people in the SED who thought in a humanly  responsible way contributed to the great and difficult task of  ensuring that the endangered mass demonstrations took a peaceful  course, for instance those in Leipzig on 9 October 1989.  [passage omitted]    [STERN] Hitler's shadow still hangs over Germany. Your most  important speech was probably the one on 8 May 1985, the 40th  anniversary of the end of the war. You were the first president  to call this date a "day of liberation," saying what many  Germans think, but at the same time many people blamed you for  it. Have we really overcome Hitler?    [Weizsaecker] Let me first comment on the criticism: Among  other things, I said that at that time, when the crimes were  being committed primarily against the Jews, many of us, also in  my generation, who were young did not open their eyes and ears  wide enough to get more information about the terrible things  that were happening. Not just a few people took umbrage at this  statement of mine. I was told that I had failed to recognize  the good faith of the overwhelming majority of the German people.    [STERN] But the core of your speech was that 8 May was a day  of liberation.    [Weizsaecker] That is what I said and I stick to it firmly.  In my speech I added clearly -- and I repeat it today -- that,  naturally, I was fully aware of the fact that for a great number  of people misery and the loss of their homes came only after 8  May 1945. However, this terrible suffering must not be blamed  on 8 May but on what happened beforehand and, in particular, on  30 January 1933. May 8 was for us all the liberation from the  unbearable Nazi regime.    [STERN] Are you worried about the rising xenophobia and  neofascism?    [Weizsaecker] The great majority of Germans are immune to  that. However, under no circumstances should we delude  ourselves with carefree security. Nor should we reassure  ourselves with the fact that some other countries are struggling  with even worse phenomena of this kind and that there is hardly  any nation in the world that is pleased to make room for large  numbers of foreigners. We have every reason to be particularly  vigilant. Our difficult past remains a lesson forever. The  murders of Solingen and Moelln have deeply shocked and shaken  us. Irresponsible slogans propagated at restaurant tables can  be a dangerous seed. In addition, too many young people are  left to their own devices, often without job prospects and  without orientation. They are easily tempted by political  rat-catchers and are easily misled to commit acts of violence  even if there is no visible political program behind such deeds.    [STERN] Do you not believe that there is a real, hard  neo-Nazi core?    [Weizsaecker] Yes, there is core, even though it is  difficult to say how hard it is and what "real" means in this  connection. Regarding programs, the scene is rather misty. In  addition, there has been an increase in the number of people who  write letters in a far more aggressive and brutal tone -- also  to me -- and give their full name and address. This did not  happen 10 years ago.    Increased vigilance is necessary not only in politics and  the  administration but, above all, among the citizens, in the  communities and towns themselves. And there one must note with  great satisfaction that there has been a sharp increase in  positive, democratic activity and vigilance. The many chains of  light were the most visible sign of that, but they are not by  far the only good signals.    [STERN] Abroad the change in the political climate is,  however, watched with the greatest suspicion. Do we Germans  actually have to press to participate in celebrating the 50th  anniversary of D-Day?    [Weizsaecker] I have already said regarding 8 May 1945 that  such days have a quite different meaning for different people.  It is good for us to think about what such anniversaries mean  among ourselves. I still hold this opinion. The profound  reconciliation with France, Britain, and the United States that  has taken place over the past decades is not in danger because  of this.    [STERN] Recently there were serious disagreements between  France and Germany, at the core of the Western alliance. Does  the new Germany have a solid foreign policy concept?    [Weizsaecker] Our situation is characterized by the fact  that, after Russia, we are the country in Europe that has by far  the most inhabitants, is located centrally, and is surrounded by  nine neighbors. In the past we were severely punished for every  attempt to follow a special national path. Our central  interest, which is perhaps greater than in most other European  countries, is that the period of nation states is overcome and  is replaced by a common European concept. We need and want  security around us, open borders for trade, and the insight and  ability to make responsible contributions to the survival of man  and nature. This is no idealized altruism, these are our  interests. At peace with our neighbors we were able to complete  the unification of our state, but all around us we are watched  with tense attention to see whether we recognize the concerns  that others had and still have about us with the necessary  sensitivity and allay them with our behavior.    [STERN] Recently one has gained the impression that this  sensitivity has been lost and that we are suddenly once again  acting with a diplomacy that runs along the lines of "hello, now  it is my turn!"    [Weizsaecker] Of course, there are better and worse days,  also regarding the impression that we sometimes give outside  Germany. All in all, however, there is positive clarity about us  also among our foreign policy friends, allies, and  interlocutors. Furthermore, sometimes we are subjected to  rather contradictory criticism.    For instance, every time we make propaganda among our  partners for strong and clear support of the reform forces and  countries in the East, these partners have repeatedly told us:  If you consider this so important, then do it yourself.  However, as soon as we do do it -- and we have done it to a  greater extent than other Western countries -- the next  criticism comes immediately, namely whether we are not going it  alone again with these support measures and seeking to ensure  monopoly advantages for ourselves. One must cope with that, and  we manage to do it. The core of our European policy is and  remains the close friendly cooperation with France and, step by  step, also a trilateral cooperation between France, Poland, and  Germany.    [STERN] You are one of the last active politicians of the  war generation....    [Weizsaecker] ...almost the last.    [STERN] Experience cannot be transferred to others. Does  one have to fear that your generation's immunity to militarism  and antidemocratic thinking will be lost?    [Weizsaecker] Indeed, every generation has its own  experience. This will determine its attitude along the lines of  its convictions. However, the Germans' relations with their  neighbors have changed fundamentally compared with the time of  my youth -- despite all current concerns and difficulties, they  have changed in a historically incredible, very impressive sense.    The key thing is not when we get a common currency in Europe  and whether we are already on the path toward a European federal  state. Rather, the key thing is that the states that make up the  European Union no longer settle conflicts by force, as in the  past, but by coming to a common understanding and that the  democratic nature of this entire European Union has been  secured. The great historic change compared with the past is the  fact that we in Germany are able to follow this path together  with the others. And I see the strength to do that in the young  Germans.</p>

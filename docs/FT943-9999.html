			<p>940808 FT  08 AUG 94 / Arts: Fringe benefits at Edinburgh - As the Festival opens Antony Thorncroft examines the diversification of the world's biggest cultural party This week they arrive in Edinburgh from every corner of the globe - the wannabe army, over 10,000 strong. They are the performers of the Fringe, the largest festival in the world, which opens next Sunday alongside the International Arts Festival to make Edinburgh, for three weeks, the cultural junkies' Nirvana. The Fringe has one inestimable advantage over other arts institutions - it is totally non-exclusive. Anyone, can come to the party. Hilary Strong, who took over in May as director, has no plans to close the door. 'We will continue the policy of a free and open Festival. It is unique and significant, especially these days when small-scale arts companies are finding it much harder to get their work seen. Here anyone can do what they like'. Strong speaks from experience. She was a member of Natural Theatre Company and played the Assembly Rooms. They lost money but it gave the company exposure and the chance to perfect a show which could then go on tour. But she is also well aware that the problem with an open market is that the powerful oppress the weak. She tries to bolster artists by telling them this is really a buyer's market. She has alerted them to the landlord who hoped to make Pounds 2,400 during the Festival by cramming 15 artists into a two bedroom flat, and she urges them to refuse to pay the venues that want Pounds 500 a week months in advance. But while the Fringe Office can warn and advise the hopefuls from 40 countries - from Omid Djalili, a half Slovak, half Iranian stand-up comedian, to a troupe of Egyptian actors performing a play written by 'Egypt's answer to Andrew Neil' - it can do little about the growing ability of a few well-placed and well-financed venues to dominate the Fringe. Last year half the 625,000 tickets sold on the Fringe were for shows at just three of the 200 venues - the Assembly Rooms, the Gilded Balloon and the Pleasance. These centrally located complexes with a myriad of stages have, thanks to generous sponsorship by Stella Artois, pooled their marketing efforts and established a super-Fringe. They divide up the top performers between them and offer the punters a choice of big-name artists in agreeable surroundings. The main complaint about the big three is that they devise their programmes: there is no pretence of an open house for aspiring newcomers. The three directors get together and apportion the talent. Bill Burdett-Coutts at the Assembly Rooms, which fills almost a fifth of all Fringe seats, goes for an equal split between comedians and theatre groups; Karen Korn at the Gilded Balloon favours young and aspiring comics; while Christopher Richardson at the Pleasance blends new theatre troupes with comedians. The over-riding characteristic of their performers is experience. The Assembly Rooms has Mark Lamarr, Jools Holland and Lee Evans, plus theatre companies Hull Truck and 7:84; at the Pleasance it's Frank Skinner, Harry Hill and Tony Hawks; at the Gilded Balloon, Sean Hughes and Hatty Hayridge - seasoned television performers all. Often the same artists appear at the same venue year after year. Their reputations secure good ticket sales, and the artists and the venue operator happily share out a 60-40 box office split. Less happy are the artists who had been hoping to get into one of the venues and who find, at the last minute, they are excluded. Rival Edinburgh operators see the big three establishing a premier division, leaving the other venues missing out on audiences who think that big means best. The reaction of the competition is - to do the same. This year Edinburgh Venue Associates has grouped together three medium sized venues, Church Hill, Hill Street and Greyfriars Kirkhouse, into a rival marketing operation, but one offering flexible deals to artists. Next year more venues could join in. Strong is all in favour of the Fringe working in closer harmony. 'If someone comes up to see musicals it is sensible if the venues presenting a musical provide information directing audiences to similar shows.' Burdett-Coutts denies that joint planning with the Gilded Balloon and the Pleasance leads to a cosy oligarchy and keeps out aspiring artists. 'I'm always looking for new talent. This year there's an American comedian, Robert Schimmel, that no one here has heard of. With 300 applications for 50 places there must be some selection. People do try and buy their way into the Assembly Rooms but what is the point if they fail to sell any tickets? It would be a bad investment.' Burdett-Coutts also thinks that another complaint about the Fringe - that it has become one vast comedy festival - is also an exaggeration. He maintains a balance between the stand ups and the dramas. Strong says there is less comedy this year, just 167 acts describing themselves this way as against 209 in 1993. Perhaps market forces are at work: the average audience at a Fringe performance last year was an all-time low of 44 per cent. But if audiences are fed up with navel-gazing monologues from stand-ups, Edinburgh is still the main showcase for comedy and a happy hunting ground for TV producers, agents, and venue operators. About 10 years ago Channel Four decided that comedy was the next rock and roll and that Edinburgh was the talent pool. Since then a generation of alternative comedians has quickly become the mainstream. 'It is the biggest comedy festival in the world,' says John Thoday of Avalon, which manages such Fringe regulars as Frank Skinner, Harry Hill, Richard Herring and Jenny Eclair. 'It is much better than the Montreal Comedy Festival where television has editorial control.' A perfect example of the Fringe effect is Harry Hill. He gave up doctoring about four years ago to chance his arm as a comedian. He booked himself into a small, remote Edinburgh venue and caused a few gentle ripples. A year later there were waves. Now he is the next big name, with a radio series under his belt and television beckoning. The glory of stand-up is its economy - no sets, no payroll. For less than Pounds 500 you can tackle Edinburgh: that will cover the rent on a cheap (shared) room (Pounds 50), a midday spot in an off-centre venue (Pounds 150), a little promotion and living costs. If you are good, word seeps out. Frank Skinner, Sean Hughes, Lee Evans all quickly made it through the Fringe, although it helped that they won the annual Perrier Award for best comedy act, which virtually guarantees a television series. Tim Hawkins of Edinburgh Venue Associates is making things even easier for one group of debutants. He is giving the four young comedians in 'New Kids on the Block' a free spot at Hill Street and paying their accommodation. He thinks they will be so successful that he will make money from the box office split. Just now the Fringe is a happy balance: it retains its anarchic freedom at one level while being a serious commercial operation, contributing well over Pounds 10m to the Edinburgh economy, at the other. There is room for Alex and Rod's 'improvisational drinking workshop' and for In one take, a show about pornography, sado-masochism and Aids. There is a Ukranian company putting on one of eight Shakespeare productions (a record low) at the Infirmary Street Swimming Pool and Ian Saville, socialist conjurer. There are no-hopers who will play to empty benches and Eartha Kitt interpreting Molly Bloom to a packed Church Hill Theatre. There is everything you have ever dreamed about and ever feared. And those who complain most that the Fringe is now too big, that it has sold out to television, that it is just wall to wall comedy, will still be back next year.</p>

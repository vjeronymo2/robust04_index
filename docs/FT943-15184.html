			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / Arts: Today's Television In tribute to the late Dennis Potter BBC1 begins a repeat of The Singing Detective, one of two original television serials I have seen in 25 years as a critic which I feel sure posterity will regard as masterpieces (the other is 'Heimat'). The hero, a writer of cheap detective stories, played by Michael Gambon, lies in a hospital bed experiencing life at three levels of consciousness: in the present, surrounded by patients and medical staff; as the detective in one of his own 1940s novels; and as a child growing up in the Forest of Dean. Potter used his famous technique of having his characters mime to popular songs in 'Pennies From Heaven' and 'Lipstick On Your Collar', but it was in 'The Singing Detective' that he got it right. His work here can be compared to a Proust novel or a Bunuel movie but, like all great works of art, it is in the end unique. Not to be missed (10.10). ITV begins a fresh batch of Frank Stubbs with Timothy Spall in the title role. Stubbs, a sort of 1990s spiv, is entertaining, but it seems unlikely that ITV's fervent hope of creating another 'Minder' will be fulfilled (9.00).</p>

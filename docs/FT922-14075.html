			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / ITV groups delay shake-up plans PLANS TO announce details of the future structure of the ITV network had to be abandoned yesterday because the ITV companies were not ready. The Independent Television Commission was set to give details of the structure, including how the national network will work and the relationship between the ITV companies and independent producers. The ITV companies said they needed more time to check on the details of the proposed contracts to supply the central network scheduler with programmes, licences and the guidelines on independent producers. Individual companies decided on Monday they wanted to take legal advice on the details of the contract and programme licences because of their importance during the next 10 years of the franchises. The ITV companies have now been given until April 24 to resolve remaining difficulties. If the companies cannot reach agreement, the ITC has the power to impose solutions. Mr David Shaw, director of the ITV Association, said yesterday: 'We don't have a problem but we do have legality after legality and these are very complex documents.' It was decided this week that Mr Shaw would be leaving the ITV Association after 11 years because of the present restructuring and the move to a more programme-oriented chief executive.</p>

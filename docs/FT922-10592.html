			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / Survey of Relocation in The UK (5): Predicament of the trailing partner - It can no longer be assumed that the wives of male employees will automatically fall into line with relocating companies' plans / The issue of spouses' jobs is now more important the unattractive term used in the relocation business - when her husband John recently had to move from the Midlands to the south-east coast for his job. A well-qualified secretary who had never been short of work back in Market Harborough, she was shocked to find there was no job for her near her new home in Hastings. She went from agency to agency for a month and then rang her old employers. They said she could resume work on Monday morning and that was enough to decide her. Mrs Dilley returned to Market Harborough without her husband and went back to work. The separation was not as serious as it might at first appear: Mr Dilley, a trainer for Emap, the publishing group, had been posted to Hastings for just six months and his company paid for him to travel back to Market Harborough each weekend. Nevertheless, the strain on the couple was considerable - surprisingly perhaps, the stress was worse for him than for her. Mrs Dilley says she is 'one of the world's copers' and, unlike her husband, was on her home territory, doing familiar work. Mr Dilley, meanwhile, was in strange surroundings and, at the end of each busy week, was faced with a long drive. His six-month stint has since been completed and they are now re-united. The predicament the Dilleys faced is increasingly common. The 'cornflake family' of television advertisements - with a Dad who goes to work and Mum who stays at home - is now comparatively rare. Women make up nearly 50 per cent of the workforce and just 14 per cent of women fulfil the traditional role of looking after their children full time. Few working couples can afford to give up a chunk of the family income. It can no longer be assumed, therefore, that the wives of male employees will automatically fall into line with relocating companies' plans. Nor can it be assumed that female employees will refuse to relocate because of their husbands' jobs: the 'trailing' male is not the unusual figure he once was. Organisations are aware of these trends. According to a survey carried out by the Confederation of British Industry, 73 per cent of companies consider that the issue of spouses' work has inhibited relocation plans; nearly half agree that employees have refused to relocate because their partners would have had to give up their jobs. Mr Jim McCredie, from KPMG Management Consulting, says theissue of spouses is now of such significance that relocation plans may be scuppered entirely by the prospect of losing staff. One example he gives is of a semi-public sector organisation - a quango - for which he carried out a relocation feasibility study. The study showed the quango would have saved a great deal of money by moving out of London and, operationally, the organisation would have suffered little from the shift. However, the study also revealed that up to 80 per cent of the staff might have refused to move, chiefly because of their spouse's jobs. Says Mr McCredie: 'For the money that was going to be saved, it was not worth the risk they could lose so many people.' The quango had a very high proportion of professional employees - professionals are more likely than other groups to have professional spouses, unwilling to ditch their careers. According to Mr McCredie, seven or eight years ago the bulk of relocating companies were organisations, like banks and insurance companies with high numbers of clerical and administrative workers. These companies were prepared, even keen, to lose employees because they could be hired more cheaply at the new location. In recent years, however, improved communications have meant that companies staffed by professionals have formed a greater proportion of relocating companies - the issue of spouses' jobs has therefore become of even greater importance. While the CBI survey found employers are aware of these trends, it also highlighted the fact that few companies have formal policies for helping spouses as part of their relocation packages. Just 9 per cent have formal policies - of these, 30 per cent offer financial compensation and 70 per cent give practical assistance such as career counselling, help with finding a job and assistance with CVs. A greater number of employers - more than 40 per cent - are prepared to offer help to spouses informally, according to the CBI. Again, practical help is the most popular, with 55 per cent providing job search assistance, 33 per cent career counselling, and just 4 per cent financial assistance. According to Ms Sue Shortland, manager of the CBI's employee relocation council, compensation for loss of earnings remains rare because it is seen as too short-term a measure and no substitute for a spouse finding a job. In the few companies where money is paid, it is likely to be equivalent to three to six months of spouses' former salaries. Says Ms Shortland: 'More common is help in identifying spouses' potential and converting skills.' As far as the actual guarantee of a job is concerned, most organisations will not want to get involved unless they themselves are also the employer of the spouse. Marks and Spencer, for example, says it will always try and provide suitable jobs for partners of relocating M and S staff - but only if they already work for the company. However, most organisations will want to stick to fairly basic practical help, such as providing information packs about the new locality, so that spouses can do their own research into local employment opportunities, says Ms Celia Baxter of KPMG Management Consulting. 'Lots of companies don't want to get involved beyond providing a financial package and trying to ensure a house-move that's as disruption-free as possible. It's often cleaner for them not to make promises they can't deliver later on,' she says.</p>

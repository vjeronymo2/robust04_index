			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / World Trade News: Dunkel environment pledge THE NEEDS of the environment will be taken into account in new international trade rules resulting from the Uruguay Round of world trade talks, Mr Arthur Dunkel, director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt), told the Business Council for Sustainable Development in Lausanne. In particular, the right of governments to set their own environmental rules would be considered, Mr Dunkel said. The preamble to the final agreement would include a commitment to implement new Gatt rules 'in the light of the general need to preserve the environment and promote sustainable economic development'. The agreement 'does not limit any government's right to pursue its own environmental goals, provided the measures are used in a non-discriminatory way', he said. This assurance will go some way to quelling fears of environmental groups, particularly in the US where they have a strong influence in the Congress. They fear the agreement would ride roughshod over a country's right to defend higher environmental standards. A group of leading American companies and exporters is urging the Bush Administration to ensure that a final agreement for the Uruguay Round specifically allows countries to enforce legitimate food, health or safety standards without fear that they will be accused of raising trade barriers. US environmental and consumer groups have criticised the draft agreement for the Uruguay Round submitted in December by Mr Dunkel, saying it threatens US environment regulations.</p>

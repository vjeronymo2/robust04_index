			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / Leading Article: Time to move on the Rock MR Felipe Gonzalez, the Spanish prime minister, was right when, during a visit to London this week, he described Britain's only remaining colony in Europe, Gibraltar, as an anachronism. That judgment is all the more true since the centuries-old dispute about sovereignty over the Rock is now the only real obstacle to a genuine improvement in relations between two countries which, in nearly every other field, are daily drawing closer. Britain's stewardship could once be justified by the argument that it was protecting the Rock's 25,000 inhabitants against the dictatorship of General Franco. However, now that Spain has become a democracy and both Britain and Spain are partners within the European Community, colonial disputes harking back to the War of the Spanish Succession are both irrelevant and embarrassing. Irrelevant, but for one important proviso. Britain would find little difficulty in divesting itself of its troublesome heritage, if it had not given a number of firm political assurances to Gibraltar. The 1713 Treaty of Utrecht, which gave Britain sovereignty over Gibraltar, stated that if this sovereignty were ever to be transferred by London, Spain would have first refusal. Yet two and a half centuries later, Britain promised in the preamble to Gibraltar's 1969 constitution that it would never agree to any transfer of sovereignty against the 'freely and democratically expressed wishes' of the people of Gibraltar. Commitment reiterated Though Britain and Spain have since agreed that the issue of sovereignty could be raised in annual discussions between them, the British commitment to the people of the Rock has been reiterated regularly. Unfortunately, it has also been used by the British government as a pretext for soft-pedalling. London has even turned a blind eye to Gibraltar's blockage of a four-year-old agreement between Britain and Spain on the joint use of the Rock's airport. Indeed, Mr Gonzalez clearly touched a sore point when he said in an interview with this newspaper that for the British, discussions with Spain about Gibraltar are like an annual visit to the dentist, while for Spain it was like a permanent stone in its shoe. Small as it is, the Rock, which is linked to Spain by an isthmus, is understandably regarded by Spaniards as part of their country. Growing irritation If anything, Spain's irritation has been growing recently because it considers that the Gibraltarians want to have their cake and eat it; to take advantage both of their special fiscal regime within the European Community and their right to freedom of movement and establishment in Spain. The Rock's rapid development as an offshore financial centre has led to Spanish accusations that it is becoming a haven for tax dodgers and money launderers. Thanks largely to tax exemptions, Gibraltar has become the largest single source of investment in Spanish real estate, with a large number of Gibraltarians either living or owning property in Spain. Mr Gonzalez is not asking for the moon. He knows that no quick solutions are possible and that only a gradual evolution of public opinion in Gibraltar can lead its people to have a change of heart. Nor is he insisting on an immediate all-or-nothing solution. A number of intermediate schemes have been proposed by Madrid, ranging from a British-Spanish condominium over Gibraltar to a lease-back system on the Hong Kong model. In all cases, Spain is prepared to accept a large measure of autonomy for the Rock. Without going into the merits of these alternative schemes, it is nevertheless reasonable to expect the British government to make a bigger effort than it has done to work out a step-by-step approach which will satisfy Spain. Certainly, the desires of the Gibraltarians have to be taken into account, but not only their wishes. At stake too, are the interests of Britain and Spain, which cannot allow their bilateral relations either to stagnate or deteriorate while they are both deeply involved in achieving greater European unity.</p>

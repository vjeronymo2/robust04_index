			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / Power groups to shed 215 jobs NATIONAL Power and PowerGen, the privatised generators, said yesterday they were closing 2,700 megawatts of generating plant, with the loss of at least 215 jobs, David Lascelles and Neil Buckley write. The announcement came as PowerGen opened the first of the new generation of gas-fired power stations at Killingholme, in Lincolnshire. PowerGen announced that it would close 1,200MW of uneconomic plant next March with the loss of 120 jobs, affecting two coal-fired plants at Castle Donington and Drakelow in the Midlands, and two gas-oil stations at Hayes, Middlesex, and Leicester. National Power said it would close 1,530MW of generating plant at eight sites in England and Wales because of surplus capacity. Agecroft station in Swinton, Manchester, faces complete closure with the loss of 95 jobs.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Sergey Karaganov, deputy director of the Russian </F> Academy of Sciences Europe Institute, under the "Opinion"  rubric: "We Must Be the First at NATO's Doors"]    [Text] A political game has begun in Europe over the  expansion of NATO. We have won the first round, but we are  starting to lose the second round. And if we do not display  boldness and initiative, we will lose the whole game. But in  that case, those to blame for the failure will have to be sought  not only in Brussels and Washington, but also in Moscow.    Having a fairly good knowledge of NATO and of the process of  how a decision is adopted in the alliance, I do not believe that  its expansion may significantly increase the almost nonexistent  military threat from the West. Although, of course, as a result  of the NATO and Russian borders being brought closer together,  the positions of people who are used to seeing each other as  potential adversariess will be strengthened, and mutual  suspicion will grow.    But the main negative consequences will be of a political  and  even economic nature. Russian positions will be weakened in the  bargaining over access to Western markets and the acquisition of  investments. But the most important thing of all is that  Russia's isolation will increase. We have no chance, in the  foreseeable future, of joining the European Community, whose  members will soon comprise the majority of European states.  Even joining the free trade zone around the EC may even prove  problematic for Russia -- not only because of the possible  opposition of the West, fearing for its markets, but also  because of protectionist trends in Russian policy.  Protectionism is inevitable in political terms, and is even  partially necessary in order to boost our nation's industry,  but, given the principle of reciprocity in opening markets, it  will make access to West European markets more difficult for us.    The CSCE -- the only major political organization in Europe  where Russia is fully represented -- is becoming relatively  weakering and most likely will not be able to become the nucleus  of a European security system.    The expansion of NATO will weaken the CSCE still further.  But the main thing is that the most promising channel of our  cooperation with the West for the next few years -- the security  sphere -- will be sealed off to a considerable extent. No  matter what "compensation" -- for the expansion of the alliance  -- our NATO neighbors may propose for us, they will most likely  not be able to avert the reinforcement of Russian's  military-political and political isolation. Russia will find  itself to a significant extent "sealed up," and forced to expend  forces and resources to break loose from the disadvantageous  position, it will be doomed to be the disturber of European  peace. Europe as well as Russia will suffer the damage.    In September-October of last year, it seemed that it would  not p]rove possible to halt the mechanism of the admittance of  four central and East European countries to NATO. But in the  end, Russia's cooperation with forces in NATO countries which do  not want the alliance to be expanded seems to have averted the  inevitable. NATO adopted the idea of "Partnership for Peace."  Moscow welcomed it. The "Partnership for Peace" sets forth four  sometimes contradictory elements. First of all, there is NATO's  attempt to gain time, look around, and conceal its lack of a  long-term strategy. Second, the desire to satisfy both Russia  on the one hand, and the countries of central and East Europe on  the other hand, at the same time. Third, the attempt to block  the entry of countries into NATO, placing them for an indefinite  time in the "political antechamber." Fourth, there is a  possible way of slowly assimilating these countries in NATO by  establishing close cooperation between their military structures  [voyennyye mashiny].    Russia has three options for responsible [otvetstvennyy]  actions. The first is not to join. The second is to formally  join, but in reality not to display any special initiative.    There are a lot of arguments in favor of the first and  second  options: We cannot tune our military organizational development  to NATO standards, and "partnership" will restrict our freedom  of action.    But it must be clearly understood that our neighbors in  central and East Europe will force their way through this door.  Plans for cooperation are already being drawn up there and  resources are being found. And if we remain apart, then in a  year or two we will simply not have any arguments left for  opposition. They will say to us: You have been given the  chance. You have not taken it. So you have simply not made any  effort toward common European military-political integration.  Do not hinder those who are striving for it, and after about  four years, NATO will be expanded.    But there is also a third option -- the only one which can  block the expansion of the bloc. Russia should state: The  expansion of the bloc may be a way of creating a collective  security system in Europe, and, if its organizational  development follows this path, it makes it its aim to join NATO  ahead of the countries of central and East Europe. At the same  time, Russia must put forward a military and military-political  cooperation program which would enable us, and not our Western  partners, to speak of insufficient will for cooperation. Only  then will we have real and weighty arguments to counteract the  expansion of NATO without Russia.    I foresee the counterarguments: Cooperation is costly, and  conditions will be imposed on us. That is true, but the country  is faced with the strategic threat of political and  military-political isolation, and such cooperation is the most  effective way of averting it. Tens of billions of rubles spent  now would save tens of billions of dollars in the very near  future.    There is another counterargument: What if NATO accepts the  challenge and says -- join! I would answer: This is impossible  in practical terms, but if it does happen, this means that  Russia will achieve one of is basic foreign policy aims, and a  collective security system will start being built in Europe.</p>

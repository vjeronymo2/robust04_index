			<p>BFN     [Text] Simferopol, [no date as received] -- A session of  the Crimean Supreme Council continued on 11 May. As expected,  the election of the chairman of the autonomous republic led to  the first parliamentary crisis.    The morning session discussed the election of deputy  speakers  of the Crimean Supreme Council. Sehiy [Sergey] Tsekov proposed  Oleksiy Melnykov, deputy head of the Republican Party of Crimea  and head of the party's Sevastopol branch, and Viktor Mezhak,  head of the People's Party of Crimea, for this post. After a  long and stormy discussion, Oleksiy Melnykov's candidacy was  rejected; 44 voted in favor and 46 against. Viktor Mezhak's  candidacy was also rejected (24 for and 53 against with 17  abstentions). The chairman of the Crimean Supreme Council  announced a break until 1500 for consultations regarding new  candidates.    During an interval, deputies discussed the possibility of  nominating Admiral Oleksandr Frolov, deputy commander of the  Black Sea Fleet responsible for combat training, and Refat  Chubarov, deputy chairman of the Majlis of the Crimean Tatar  people and leader of the Kurultay's deputies group.    Commenting on the situation, Leonid Hrach, first secretary  of  the Communist Party of Crimea, noted: "I did not expect such a  level from our parliament. It is possible to have a middle or a  low level but what I see is simply primitive. Progressive  forces among the deputies will hardly make contact with the  present leadership of the Supreme Council, or to be more  specific, with the leader. Such a situation will, in my  opinion, last for about another two months, until the next  round."</p>

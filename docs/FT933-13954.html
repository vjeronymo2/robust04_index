			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: Rank Organisation It is always fun watching the stock market change its mind mid-way through a trading session. Yesterday's reaction to Rank's interim results was a classic example. The initial response to the company's accelerated dividend payments and enhanced scrip alternative was that of a child in receipt of a bag of sweets. But then it dawned that the change meant Rank, which is mainly bought as a yield stock, would not make another pay-out for a year. Such market volatility may only be temporary. Yet there are more substantial concerns affecting Rank. The company takes a decidedly cautious view about recovery. Indeed, the US appears to be growing stickier by the day. Moreover, Rank is less operationally geared than many other leisure businesses. Having sold its most cyclical assets, such as hotels, it will not see a rapid upswing in demand. The differing effects of lower interest rates on its 200m customers are an added complication. Youngsters with higher income may dash out to the disco more often. But middle-aged couples feeling the pinch are seeking better value summer holidays, while pensioners with bulging building society accounts are indulging less on bingo. All this suggests Rank's progress may be rather soggy. And, although Rank Xerox has endured the recession well, its contribution to profits is unlikely to rise rapidly either. With net borrowings topping Pounds 1bn, Rank has limited scope for acquisitive growth. If fully taken up, the enhanced scrip alternative may ease the strain since it is in effect a mini-rights issue. But unless big disposals are forthcoming, there is likely to be more excitement elsewhere in the leisure sector.</p>

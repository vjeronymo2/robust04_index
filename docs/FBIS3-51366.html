Reina said that from now on  "firm negotiations" will prevail during the meetings he will  hold with the international financial organization. Reina is  also scheduled to meet with either President Bill Clinton or  Vice President Al Gore.    Rafael Leonardo Callejas' successor will travel to  Washington  tomorrow accompanied by his economic cabinet. This is considered  a very important step as he will analyze future relations with  the financial institutions that forced the Nationalist to adopt  unpopular measures.    Reina said: "I am opposed to more blows against the people.  This situation will be dealt with through firm negotiations,  presenting solid arguments by prepared advisers. These advisers  must find just and correct ways to solve the negative figures my  government will have to face."    Reina said he will go on his trip with a different  mentality,  believing that the international institutions will understand  his desire to "give a humanistic image" to the effects of  Callejas' economic measures. This is why "I hope these meetings  will be very productive for projects aimed at developing our  country." he noted.    For the president-elect, the meetings he will hold with high  ranking officials of the U.S. Government are "of significant  importance and benefit for bilateral relations between Honduras  and the United States."    During the week, the president-elect asked his economic  cabinet to analyze the state's finances in order to present a  report to the multilateral organizations. This type of  information "is fundamental to clarifying all the conditions  imposed by the international organization and as a support to  our moral revolutionary project," he explained.    With reference to U.S. exerted pressures, Reina said that  "you cannot demand a friendly government to make sacrifices with  such high political costs. If they want to help, they will lend  us their hand. That friendly hand will help our country resolve  this truly sticky situation." In Reina's opinion "the  international organizations are not hard, that attitude belongs  to the cold war era."    Upon his arrival, the president-elect will meet with John  Spero, secretary of negotiations and economic matters of the  State Department. Early tomorrow Reina will meet with envoy  Charlene Barchefsky, from the Treasury Department; Carlos Munoz,  chief of the Central American Division; and Julio Suarez,  advisor to the executive director.    Immediately thereafter, the president-elect will meet with  Jeffrey Shafer, assistant (international affairs) secretary of  the Treasury Department, and then he will have lunch with  Enrique Iglesias, president of the Inter-American Development  Bank. In the evening, the Honduran delegation will have dinner  with senators and congressmen.    On Thursday, Reina will breakfast with the members of the  Council of the Americas and following that he will meet with  Brian Atwood, under secretary for Management, State Department.  At noon, Reina will lunch with Kathleen Hennesy, a State  Department official, and in the afternoon he plans to meet with  President Bill Clinton or Vice President Al Gore.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Sezai Sengun: "A Secret Memorandum to Greece"] </F>   [Text] Ankara--The Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs has  drawn up a report which will have a significant impact on  Turkey's relations with Greece.    The report seems more like a memorandum to Athens, which  recently adopted a hostile approach to Turkey and moved to place  Cyprus within the Greek defense zone. It has been submitted to  the pertinent departments affiliated with the prime minister's  office.    HURRIYET has been able to acquire the report. It says in  part: "The question of to which country the Aegean islands,  which do not have a military status, belong will be placed on  the agenda if Greece continues to arm them." That is a very  strong warning.    The report outlines the following:    1. The non-military status of the Aegean islands has been  established by international agreements, which are still valid.  That state of affairs concerns Turkey's security.    2. However, Greece's effort to weaken the status of the  islands will place the question of to which country they belong  on the agenda. That is due to the fact that the status of the  islands and the question of to which country they belong have  been jointly established by those agreements.    3. The islands in the Aegean Sea do not have a military  status. Any move to overlook that fact will automatically raise  the question of which country they belong to.    The report notes that Samothraki, Limnos, Khios, Samos,  Ikaria, Astipalaia, Rhodes, Kalki, Lipsoi, Kos, and  Kastellorizon have been turned into arms depots and that this  state of affairs has recently created a very significant  disadvantage for Turkey's security. It says that the islands  have been armed since 1964, contrary to the Lausanne and Paris  Agreements. But that activity gained momentum when the PASOK  [Panhellenic Socialist Movement] Government came to power in  Greece. The report makes the following assessment: "Greece has  stepped up its efforts to undermine the status of the Aegean  islands through faits accompli. Naturally, that state of  affairs will place the question of to which country they belong  on the agenda."    In a statement to HURRIYET on the matter, a diplomat has  said: "The meaning of that is quite clear. Turkey will move to  claim rights on those islands if Greece maintains its present  approach."</p>

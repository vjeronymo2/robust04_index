			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / BR plans may lead to small private networks THE IMMINENT white paper on the privatisation of British Rail is expected to pave the way for a re-creation of historic private railway companies such as the Great Western. The plans partly take on board the desire of Mr John Major, the prime minister, to see a revival of the pride and loyalty associated with the four regional railway companies which existed before the 1948 nationalisation. But the white paper should also reflect current realities by basing the division of the passenger railway on the 19 so-called profit centres recently established by BR as part of its restructuring. The result of this smaller sub-division of the network will be to take the structure further back in history to the days of the smaller companies before the regional companies were created in 1923. The private sector will be invited to bid for franchises to run the services now being operated by the profit centres. Examples of main line franchise areas include the former Great Western lines from Paddington to the south-west, and the former London Midland &amp; Scottish Railway lines from Euston to the north-west. On Network SouthEast, south of the Thames, the three franchise areas are expected to coincide almost exactly with the routes once operated by the London &amp; South Western Railway, the London Brighton &amp; South Coast Railway and the South East &amp; Chatham Railway. Ministers acknowledge, however, that privatisation is on a slow track, particularly in the wake of the big losses announced this week by British Rail. Only a minority of passenger services are expected to be franchised within the five-year term of the current government. The lines likely to be franchised first are those where substantial investment has taken place, such as Network SouthEast's Thames and Chiltern services. Others awaiting investment are likely to stay in the public sector indefinitely. Ministers acknowledge that uncertainty over the prospects for privatisation will linger beyond the summer because the coming white paper will not tackle how private train operators will be charged for the use of British Rail's tracks. Instead, track charges will be the subject of a separate report later this year. But ministers indicate the government will not be prepared to subsidise them. On the other hand, subsidies for socially necessary train services will continue. Commuter fares will also remain subject to political control, with the government compensating operators for loss of potential revenue. More of the same for BR, Page 9</p>

			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report COCOA prices jumped back from their morning lows in fairly active trading at the London Commodity Exchange. 'Some people were waiting for a sell-off but there was more buying than selling,' one trader said, adding there there was still sign of producer sales. The December futures price dipped to Pounds 892 a tonne at one stage but closed at Pounds 913 a tonne, up Pounds 9 on the day. The robusta COFFEE market also managed to pull back from its lows, but still ended the day with the November futures position Dollars 11 down at Dollars 1,245 a tonne. Traders said that at the lows (Dollars 1,235 for November delivery) there was no follow-through selling and there was a little support from roaster interest. 'The market is looking weak. It should by rights move lower,' one said. At the London Metal Exchange NICKEL and TIN prices added to Monday's losses. Yet another stock increase depressed the nickel market before trade-based support helped it to move back above the Dollars 4,200-a-tonne level. Tin was pressured by persistent sales from US Defence Logistics Agency stocks and dull demand. Compiled from Reuters</p>

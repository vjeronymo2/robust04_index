			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / Fishing: Days of joy before the fouling of Eden - Tom Fort reflects on the pleasures of his favourite river - since stricken by an ecological disaster a lifetime or so - most of England was blessed with true trout rivers, by which I mean rivers with self-sustaining stocks of native brown trout. But our age, characterised by neglect and abuse, has seen the destruction of much of this legacy. Pollution, abstraction, and unthinking exploitation has picked off one river after another, and the process of ruination continues. Of course, there are still English rivers on which the wild brown trout may be caught. Those game, fierce fellows of Exmoor and Dartmoor still thrive. There are sanctuaries elsewhere in Derbyshire, Yorkshire, Northumbria and Shropshire. And the wild fish hang on in the chalk streams of the south, despite often being outnumbered and eclipsed by stocked interlopers. Although a southerner who does most of his fishing on the Kennet, my most potent daydreams are of another river which belongs to the north-west. It is the Eden, a great, broad river in Cumbria which defines a landscape of sweeping, fertile fields and treeless, dun fells. It has a scale and a grandeur which no southern river can match, and its trout are - for the most part - wild. A while ago, l wrote of the bridge over the Eden at Langwathby, and the view of the river above. It is as grand a sight to me now as when I first drank it in nearly 30 years ago. The river here is so wide that, between one bank and the other, it presents most of the varied aspects of its enchanting character. There are bubbly shallows, dark channels between rosy sandstone boulders, marbled runs emerald with weed, and calm depths shaded by beech and hazel. When there is a hatch of fly, it can take a full morning to do justice to this short stretch, from the bridge up to where the river bends to the right. A little way higher is a steep bluff, thick with trees. The water runs deep and strong at its foot and is full of trout - although the difficulty of the wading and the steepness of the bank make getting at them something of a trial. Above this stretch are wide, featureless flats followed by a tremendous reach, deep enough to demand chest waders, thick with weed and alive with fish. I have stood there at the height of a sedge hatch on a June night and lost my head and my nerve utterly at the sight of a surface boiling with feeding trout. There, too, I suffered an early, indelible trauma. In those days, I knew nothing of the dry fly and almost nothing of matching the fly to the hatch. I would tie on a made-up cast of three flies - Fartridge and Orange, Brown Owl and Greenwell, perhaps - and fish with it until a break or a tangle forced me to desist. On this occasion, I was with one of my brothers. It was late April. The sky was white, the wind raw, and soon it began to snow heavily. We were astounded when a frenzied rise began. Between the snowflakes, we saw multitudes of dark, high-winged flies on the water and the trout slashing at them. Delirious with excitement, we flailed away until the numbness of cold and failure overwhelmed us. Several years later, I realised that the hatch was of iron blues and that, with a dry fly or a wet Snipe-and-Purple, we must have done great deeds. In those days, we fished the wet fly downstream and nothing else. I used to hook a lot of fish - and lose a lot. When the weather warmed and the water fined, the trout would not look at a wet fly. One hot day in June, I watched a stranger extract two fish of more than 1lb each on a dry black gnat. Entranced by the delicacy of the execution, I became an instant convert. In general, I have remained true to the faith and the rewards have been rich. There was a day, a couple of years ago, when the light olives hatched for 12 hours without cease. I began below Watersmeet, where the Eamont flows into the Eden, then fished up the Eamont, and returned to the Eden as twilight came. And when I reeled in and splashed to the bank, the bats were out and the trout were still taking. So many hours and days on the Eden come back to the mind, the disasters and blanks filtered out to leave the triumphs and the joys. Each time I have returned, I - like so many before me on this river - have thought how well it was named. There is, though, a ghastly footnote to this lyrical celebration. At the end of March this year, a tank containing liquid ammonium oxide fertiliser overturned beside a small watercourse at the head of the Eden valley. The chemical killed virtually every fish along 20 miles of river. Although the slaughter stopped short of the stretch which I know and love, the whole river has been stricken by the disaster. It is a reminder - if such were needed - of man's infinite capacity for defiling his inheritance, and of what happened to the first Eden.</p>

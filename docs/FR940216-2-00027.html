This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> means that SPRANS projects are expected to serve and appropriately  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> involve in project activities members of ethnoculturally distinct  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> groups, unless there are compelling programmatic or other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> justifications for not doing so. The MCHB <!-- PJG 0034 unknown --> s intent is to ensure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that project outcomes are of benefit to culturally distinct  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> populations and to ensure that the broadest possible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> representation of culturally distinct and historically underserved  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> groups is supported through programs and projects sponsored by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> MCHB.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Projects supported under SPRANS are expected to be part of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> community-wide, comprehensive initiatives, to reflect appropriate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> coordination of primary care and public health activities, and to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> target HRSA resources effectively to fill gaps in the Nation <!-- PJG 0034 unknown --> s  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> health system for at-risk mothers and children. This applies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> especially to projects in the 15 communities in the Nation which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have received grants from HRSA under the Administration <!-- PJG 0034 unknown --> s Healthy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Start initiative. Grantees in these communities providing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> services related to activities of a Healthy Start program are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expected to coordinate their projects with the Healthy Start  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program efforts. Healthy Start communities include: Aberdeen  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Area Indian Nations, NE/ND/SD; Baltimore, MD; Birmingham, AL;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Boston, MA; Chicago, IL; Cleveland, OH; Detroit, MI; Lake County,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> IN; New Orleans, LA; New York, NY; Oakland, CA; Philadelphia, PA;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pittsburgh, PA; PeeDee Region, SC; and Washington, DC.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Grants/Amounts: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Up to $600,000 of SPRANS funds will be available  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to support up to two projects at a maximum of $300,000 per award  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for a one-year period.

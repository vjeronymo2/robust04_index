			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "France In Favor of a General </F> Embargo"]    [Text] On Tuesday evening [25 January] at UN Headquarters,  France circulated a draft resolution calling for a strengthening  of sanctions against the Haitian military junta by means of a  general embargo on the island. The text, which still can be  amended, recommends extending the oil and military embargo to  all fields of activity, except humanitarian aid. The embargo  should also apply to all noncommercial flights from or to Haiti;  this actually applies to small aircraft involved in all kinds of  trafficking -- mainly drug -- linked with Haiti. France  suggests that these measures be enforced on 31 January at 11:59  [time zone not specified].</p>

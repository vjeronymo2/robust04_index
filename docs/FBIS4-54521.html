			<p>BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, 1 May (TANJUG) -- The main headquarters of  the republic of Srpska army today announced that on 30 April UN  Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] took part -- together with Muslim  units -- in an attack on Serbian positions in the Tuzla region.  A statement says that two armored vehicle platoons of the  Nordic battalion were involved in the attack in which nine  people were killed and five wounded on the Serbian side.    The main headquarters has received reports that Nordic  officers received 500,000 German marks for the UNPROFOR  armored-mechanized and artillery support for Muslim infantry.    The statement, issued today by Chief of Staff Manojlo  Milovanovic on behalf of the main headquarters, reads:    On 30 April UNPROFOR launched their first ground assault on  positions of the Srpska republic army and Serb territory in  former Bosnia-Herzegovina. Early yesterday morning the Muslim  forces launched a strong, well-organized artillery and infantry  attack from the demarcation lines around Kalesija, Kladanj, and  Olovo, in the Tuzla area. The attack on Vis hill, the Srpska  republic army's closest position to Tuzla airport, was  particularly strong, with the objective of provoking a heavy  Serb response against the airport, which would then be used to  force NATO into issuing an ultimatum to the Serbs to withdraw  their heavy weapons to 20 km from Tuzla and Dubrave airport.    Two armored vehicles from the Nordic battalion deployed in  the Tuzla area also took part in the attack against the Serbian  positions and territory. Colonel Bosne himself, the deputy  UNPROFOR chief of staff for the former Bosnia-Herzegovina, has  admitted that this unit fired 74 shells. We have found out that  the Muslims have paid 500,000 German marks to one of the Nordic  battalion commanders for support for the Muslim infantry by  UNPROFOR armored vehicles and artillery units. They paid 5,000  German marks for each armored vehicle that took part in the  attack and 1,000 marks for each artillery shell fired. According  to unofficial reports, UNPROFOR is currently investigating the  involvement of its ground forces in the Muslim offensive.    The following are the names of the casualties caused by the  first ground attack by UNPROFOR against the Serbian positions,  in which armoured vehicles and Leopard tanks were used: Milic  Mara (1927), Radivojevic Ruza (1950), Krstic Mira (1976), Stupar  Ljubisa (1955), Radojcic Ljubisa (1968), Petrovic Zoran (1963),  Zepinic Milisav (1954), Vukovic Zoran (1964), and Brkic Branko  (1948). Milic Danica, Radivojevic Djoko, Todic Mirko, Tripic  Milko, and Pavic Dragan were wounded.    This UNPROFOR attack is the best confirmation that the  authorities and the army of the republic of Srpska were  justified when they earlier opposed the deployment of tanks and  other heavy offensive weapons in the Tuzla area. At the same  time, this is a proof of open and biased involvement of the UN  peace forces on the Muslim side. This casts serious doubt on  their peace mission and, objectively speaking, will lead to the  internationalization of the war in this region.    Under the international law on warfare, the republic of  Srpska army has the right to return fire on the attacker's  forces, regardless of where their positions are. However, the  republic of Srpska army will not respond on this occasion, in  the belief that UNPROFOR's attack is the action of an  irresponsible officer who is probably involved in the  above-mentioned money deals with the Muslims, the statement says.</p>

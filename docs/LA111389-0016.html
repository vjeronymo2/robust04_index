			<p><P> November 13, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TENNIS ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> CHANG WINS EASILY AT LONDON  </P> <P> Michael Chang played almost flawlessly Sunday in crushing Guy Forget of France,  6-2, 6-1, 6-1, to win the Wembley indoor championships in London.  </P> <P> It was Chang's first tournament victory since he won the French Open title in  June.  </P> <P> Chang, seeded second, needed only 90 minutes to beat the unseeded Forget.  Chang, 17, won $80,000, and Forget, who returned to the circuit in September  after a five-month injury layoff, earned $40,000.  </P> <P> "It was good to come here and win," Chang said. "I've only got the Masters to  go, and finishing off the year well is a good confidence boost."  </P> <P> Forget said no matter what he tried, it did not work against Chang.  </P> <P> "It just got worse and worse," Forget said. "Every time I tried to find a  solution, he came up with a better answer."  </P> <P> McEnroe teamed with Jakob Hlasek to win the doubles title by defeating Jeremy  Bates of Britain and Kevin Curren, 6-1, 7-6.  </P> <P> Second-seeded Zina Garrison of Houston struggled past the Soviet Union's Larisa  Savchenko to score a 6-3, 2-6, 6-4 victory in the $250,000 Virginia Slims  tournament at Chicago.  </P> <P> "I felt a little bit slow out there today," Garrison said. "The second set she  hit the ball and won the points and there was nothing I could possibly have  done. It's just a matter of saying . . . 'I've been working hard, and if you're  going to beat me, you got to keep hitting winners.' "  </P> <P> Garrison, 25, ranked No 5 in the world, won $50,000 by defeating the unseeded  Savchenko, 23, for the fourth time in as many matches.  </P> <P> "I felt kind of hopeless out there," Garrison said. "Her backhands were just  falling . . . Whatever she did was like gold."  </P> <P> Ivan Lendl held off a tough opening-set effort by Magnus Gustafsson of Sweden  and turned the final into a rout to win the Stockholm Open.  </P> <P> Lendl, the world's top-ranked player, won, 7-5, 6-0, 6-3. It was his first  victory in this tournament, the world's oldest Grand Prix indoors, and his 83rd  career singles title.  </P> <P> Lendl earned $200,000, Gustafsson $100,000.  </P> <P> Gustafsson, who was ranked 92nd in the world, upset three seeded players en  route to the final -- No. 12 Paolo Cane of Italy, No. 4 Andre Agassi and No. 8  Mats Wilander of Sweden.  </P> <P> Jorge Lozano of Mexico and Todd Witsken of Carmel, Ind., defeated the  top-seeded team of Rick Leach and Jim Pugh, 6-3, 5-7, 6-3, in the doubles  final.  </P> <P> Sixth-seeded Leila Meskhi became the first Soviet woman in 15 years to win a  regular-circuit tournament in the United States, defeating second seeded Helen  Kelesi of Canada, 6-3, 6-4, in a Virginia Slims tournament at Brentwood, Tenn.  </P> <P> The last Soviet woman to win a championship was Olga Morozova, who beat Billie  Jean King in 1974 in Philadelphia.  </P> <P> Jason Netter of UCLA defeated Arizona's Scott Sigerseth, 6-4, 6-1, to win the  Rolex-Intercollegiate tournament at UC Irvine.  </P> <P> Irvine's Trevor Kronemann and Shige Kanroji, the country's top-ranked doubles  team, beat Mark Knowles and Fritz Bissell of UCLA, 7-6 (7-3), 6-4, in that  final.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Regulations Governing the Examination of Cases by </F> Discipline Inspection Organs of the Communist Party of China  (adopted at the 65th meeting of the Standing Committee of the  CPC Central Committee's Discipline Inspection Commission on 28  January 1994)"]    [Text] Beijing, 15 Apr (XINHUA) -- Chapter I.  General Principles    Article 1. Examination of cases of discipline violation  within the CPC is an important task of the discipline inspection  organs of the CPC and is the central link for strictly enforcing  party discipline. With a view to standardizing and  institutionalizing the examination of cases and improving  quality and efficiency in handling cases, these regulations are  formulated in accordance with the relevant provisions of the  CPC's Constitution and in conjunction with practice in examining  cases.    Article 2. The guiding principles for the work of examining  cases are, through the enforcement of discipline and the  handling of cases, safeguarding the party's constitution and  other party laws and regulations, strengthening party  discipline, improving the party's work style, encouraging  honesty, protecting reform and opening to the outside world,  promoting economic development, and ensuring the smooth  implementation of the party's basic line.    Article 3. Discipline inspection organs exercise their right  to examine cases in accordance with the party constitution and  these regulations free from interference from state organs,  social organizations, and individuals.    Article 4. In examining cases, discipline inspection organs  must uphold the principle of seeking truth from facts, and on  the basis of facts and with party discipline as the criterion,  they must see to it that the facts are clear, the evidence is  indisputable, the nature of the offense is accurately described,  the handling is appropriate, and the procedures are complete.    Article 5. In examining cases, the principle that all are  equal before party discipline must be adhered to, and any party  member and party organization must be examined according to  these regulations if they violate party discipline.    Article 6. In examining cases, discipline inspection organs  shall rely on party organizations at all levels, take the mass  line, and improve coordination between themselves and other  relevant departments.    Article 7. In examining cases, discipline inspection organs  shall implement the principle of learning from past mistakes to  avoid future ones and curing the sickness to save the patient in  order to achieve the dual purposes of maintaining strict party  discipline and educating the offender as well as other party  members.    Article 8. In the course of examining a case, a discipline  inspection organ shall effectively ensure that party members,  including those who are being examined, exercise their rights  bestowed on them by the party constitution.    Article 9. The examination of cases shall be conducted at  different levels, with each level assuming its responsibilities.  <H5>  Chapter II. Acceptance and Hearing of a Case and Initial </H5> Verification    Article 10. Discipline inspection organs shall accept and  hear the following listed cases of violation of discipline  reported, filed, or discovered:    (1) Violations of discipline by a member of the party  committee or discipline inspection commission of the same level;    (2) Violations of discipline by a party member cadre who is  working in a locality or a department but is under the  administration of a party committee at a higher level;    (3) Violations of discipline by a party member cadre under  the administration of a party committee of the same level;    (4) Violations of discipline by a party organization at a  lower level;    (5) Cases of violations of discipline in connection with  other party members and party organizations assigned by the  leadership of a higher level.    When necessary, discipline inspection organs may accept and  hear a case of violations of discipline of a serious and typical  nature involving a party member and party organization under the  jurisdiction of a party committee at a lower level.    Article 11. After accepting a case of discipline violation  involving a party member or a party organization, a discipline  inspection organ shall, in line with the circumstances, decide  whether initial verification is necessary. If initial  verification is necessary, it shall promptly send personnel to  do the job; when necessary, it may entrust a discipline  inspection organ at a lower level to obtain the initial  verification.    Article 12. The purpose of obtaining initial verification is  to find out whether the main complaints exist and whether there  is evidence for prosecuting the case.    Article 13. In obtaining initial verification, the methods  contained in (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), and (8) of Article 28 of  these regulations may be adopted to collect evidence.    Article 14. Personnel participating in the initial  verification shall write reports about their findings upon  completing the initial verification, and discipline inspection  organs shall handle relevant cases according to the situation:    (1) Where an issue has not been truthfully reflected, the  unit and party organization to which the person involved belongs  shall be briefed about the situation, and when necessary, the  person involved will also be briefed and to a certain extent,  given explanations to clarify things;    (2) Where facts point to a violation of discipline of a less  serious nature which does not require an investigation to affix  responsibility for party discipline, suggestions shall be made  to the relevant party organizations to handle the case properly;  and    (3) Where facts actually point to a violation of discipline  which then requires an investigation to affix responsibility for  party discipline, the case shall be placed on file for  investigation and prosecution.    Article 15. The time limit for conducting an initial  verification is two months, and this can be extended another  month if necessary. If initial verification cannot be completed  within the extended period due to the seriousness and complexity  of the case, the time limit can be suitably extended again upon  approval.  <H5>  Chapter III. Placing a Case on File for Investigation and </H5> Prosecution    Article 16. A party member or party organization which has  been reported to the authorities, which faces accusation, and  which has been revealed for violating discipline, and whose  actions merit investigation to affix responsibility for party  discipline after it has been proved, through initial  verification, that discipline is violated will go through the  formalities -- conducted within the limits of authority -- of  having its case placed on file for investigation and prosecution.    Article 17. Cases of discipline violations by party members  will be placed on separate files for investigation and  prosecution according to the ranks of party members.    (1) The Central Discipline Inspection Commission shall seek  approval from the party Central Committee to place on file for  investigation and prosecution cases involving party discipline  violations by party Central Committee members or members of the  Central Discipline Inspection Commission.    (2) Cases involving party discipline violations by standing  committee members of party committees and discipline inspection  commissions at all levels below the party Central Committee  (secretaries and deputy secretaries in grass-roots party  committees and discipline inspection commissions), and by party  committee members who hold positions equivalent to party  committee standing committee members, shall be placed on file  for investigation and prosecution if so decided by discipline  inspection commissions immediately above the levels of the  relevant committees or commissions. These discipline inspection  commissions shall seek the opinions of party committees at  corresponding levels before making any decisions to place the  cases on file for investigation and prosecution. Party  discipline violations by other committee and commission members  shall be reported by discipline inspection commissions of the  same levels to party committees of equivalent levels, which will  give approval to place the cases on file for investigation and  prosecution.    (3) Other party members who are cadres and who violate  party discipline will be handled according to the limits of  authority over the management of cadres. Corresponding  discipline inspection commissions, or discipline inspection work  committees or organs, shall decide whether or not to place the  cases on file for investigation and prosecution, and they shall  solicit opinions from party committees, or party work committees  or organs, of the same levels before making their decisions. In  the absence of discipline inspection commissions, or discipline  inspection work committees or organs, corresponding party  committees, or party work committees or organs, shall decide on  whether or not to put the cases on file for investigation and  prosecution.    (4) Grass-roots discipline inspection commissions shall  decide whether or not to place on file for investigation and  prosecution cases involving party discipline violation by party  members who are not cadres.    Article 18. Unless stipulated otherwise, local discipline  inspection organs shall, in general, decide whether or not to  place on file for investigation and prosecution any cases of  party discipline violation by party members who are cadres at  competent departments and who fall under the party's limits of  authority for appointments and removals of local personnel and  cadres.    If local discipline inspection organizations believe that it  is more appropriate for discipline inspection organs of  competent departments to place a case on file for investigation  and prosecution, the former may let the latter do so after  consulting with them. Discipline violation cases which,  according to stipulations, shall be handled by discipline  inspection organs of competent departments may also be placed on  file for investigation and prosecution by local discipline  inspection organizations after consultations.    Article 19. Serious party discipline violations by party  organizations of certain levels shall be reported by discipline  inspection organizations immediately above the relevant levels  of the party organizations to party committees at levels  equivalent to the discipline inspection organizations', and  permission shall be sought from the party committees to place  the case on file for inspection and prosecution. Discipline  inspection commissions at levels immediately above the  aforementioned discipline inspection organizations' may also  directly make decisions to place the case on file for  investigation and prosecution after soliciting opinions from  party committees of equivalent levels.    Article 20. When necessary, discipline inspection organs of  higher levels may make direct decisions to place major  discipline violation cases on file for investigation and  prosecution, even when these cases should be filed by discipline  inspection organs of lower levels.    Article 21. Discipline inspection organs of higher levels  may instruct discipline inspection organs of lower levels to  place discipline violation cases on file for investigation and  prosecution if they discover that the latter are responsible for  putting these cases on file.    Article 22. When a case has to be put on file for  investigation and prosecution, reports seeking approval for  filing shall be written, with materials from relevant  accusations and reports about the initial verification appended  to them. The reports shall be submitted for examination and  approved in line with the limits of authority for approving the  filing.    The time limit for examining a report asking for permission  to put a case on file for investigation and prosecution shall  not exceed one month.    Discipline inspection organizations shall inform  organization  departments of party committees at the same levels about cases  which have been approved for filing.    Chapter IV. Investigation    Article 23. The organ that places a case on file for further  action shall organize an investigation team according to the  circumstances surrounding that case.    Article 24. The investigation team should familiarize itself  with the circumstances surrounding that case, find out about  policies and provisions related to it, draw up an investigation  plan based on its study, and convey the decision to pursue the  case to the party organization of the unit to which the person  under investigation belongs.    The party organization in the unit to which the person being  investigated belongs should actively support the handling of the  case and strengthen the education of the investigated person as  well as people in the know. It must not, without the prior  consent of the organ pursuing the case or the investigation  team, give the person being investigated approval to leave our  territory, go abroad, or go on a business trip, and not  transfer, promote, or give awards to the investigated person.    Article 25. Under normal circumstances, the investigation  team shall begin its investigation with a talk with the person  being investigated that is held jointly with the party  organization in the unit to which the person being investigated  belongs. At the talk, the person being investigated shall be  told the decision to place the case on file for further action  and the discipline to be taken, and the person should be  requested to take a correct attitude toward the organized  investigation. During the investigation, the investigation team  shall listen earnestly to the investigated person's  representations and opinions and conduct proper ideological work  and education.    Article 26. Where the investigation team believes that a  cadre with party membership under investigation has committed  serious mistakes, is no longer fit for his or her current  position, or will hinder the investigation, it may propose  suspending the investigated person from office for examination.  A decision to suspend the investigated person from party office  for examination shall be made by a party committee that has  earlier approved the filing of the case for further action, or  be made, after consultations with the party committee at the  same level, by a discipline inspection organ that has filed the  case directly.    Article 27. All facts proving the authenticity of the case  shall be deemed to be evidence. Evidence shall include material  evidence, documentary evidence, witnesses' testimony, injured  parties' representations, the investigated person's  representations, audio and video material, spot notes,  conclusions of appraisals, and notes on surveys and examinations.    Evidence shall be verified as genuine before it can be used  as a basis for reaching conclusion on the case.    Article 28. All organizations and individuals with knowledge  about circumstances concerning the case are obliged to provide  evidence. The investigation team has the right to take the  following measures in accordance with stipulated procedures to  carry out an investigation and to gather evidence; the  organizations and individuals concerned must provide evidence  accurately and not decline to do so or create obstructions.    (1) To look up and duplicate documents, information, account  books, bills, minutes of meetings, work notes, and other  documentary matters;    (2) To demand that the organizations concerned provide  documents, information, and other paper documents, and give  other essential illustrations;    (3) To demand that the personnel concerned give explanations  at a stipulated time and place on issues related to the case;    (4) To make audio or video recordings or take photographs of  personnel and matters related to the case where necessary;    (5) To request that relevant specialized organizations or  personnel appraise specialized issues related to the case and  draw conclusions;    (6) To, upon approval by the responsible person of a  discipline inspection organ at or above the county level, hold  in temporary custody or seal up documents, information, account  books, bills, articles, and illegal incomes that could serve to  prove an act of discipline violation;    (7) To, upon approval by the responsible person of a  discipline inspection organ at or above the county level, check  the investigated party's deposits in banks or other financial  institutions and notify the banks or financial institutions  concerned to suspend payment from the accounts in question;    (8) To gather all other evidence that could serve to prove  the authenticity of the case.    Article 29. In investigations and in collecting evidence,  it is necessary to ensure the following points:    (1) In collecting material and written evidence, every  effort  should be made to get the actual items or the originals; if it  is impossible to get the actual items or the originals,  photographs or copies may be used, but their custodians or their  origin should be indicated; and written evidence should bear the  custodian's signature or stamp;    (2) Witnesses should be told about their responsibility, and  one witness should produce one copy of testimony, which may  either be written by the witness himself or written by the  investigator and confirmed by the witness; all testimonies  should contain information on the witness's identity and the  time of testifying and bear the witness's signature or stamp; if  the witness wants to change a part of or the entire testimony,  he may produce a new testimony, but he must indicate the reason  for the change, and the original testimony shall not be returned  to him; a witness shall be interviewed by at least two  investigators at the same time; the provisions of this item are  applicable to the collection of statements by victims and  statements by those being investigated; and    (3) Any investigation materials transferred from relevant  organs must be seriously examined, and they may not be used as  evidence before they are reaffirmed by investigators.    Article 30. Public security, judicial, and other  law-enforcement departments should actively cooperate if they  are required to provide relevant materials for the investigation  of discipline violation cases.    Article 31. It is necessary to seriously verify the evidence  and strictly prevent falsified and wrong evidence. If evidence  is dubious, new and additional evidence should be collected.    Article 32. An act of wrongdoing must not be confirmed  without sufficient, accurate evidence. It shall not be  confirmed with only the statements of those being investigated.  An act of wrongdoing may be confirmed with sufficient evidence,  even if the person being investigated refuses to admit it.    Article 33. The investigating team should prepare written  materials on a confirmed act of wrongdoing and check with the  person being investigated. Reasonable opinions of the person  being investigated should be accepted, and a supplementary  investigation should be carried out if necessary. A written  refutation should be prepared to deal with unreasonable  arguments.    The person being investigated should make written comments  on  the written wrongdoing materials. If the person being  investigated refuses to make comments, this should be so  indicated on the wrongdoing materials by the investigating team.    Article 34. After basically completing the investigation and  collection of evidence, the investigating team should prepare an  investigation report after collective discussion. The basic  contents of the investigation report should include the basis  for placing the case on file, major facts and the nature of the  wrongdoing, the responsibility of the persons involved, the  investigated person's attitude toward the investigation, and  recommended actions. During the investigation, any negation of  questions should be clearly explained. Questions which are hard  to confirm should be reported according to the facts. The  investigation report shall be signed by all members of the  investigating team.    If members of the investigating team have a relatively big  difference over the nature of the wrongdoing, the responsibility  of the persons involved, and the recommended actions, and if  they cannot reach a consensus after discussion, the  investigation report should be written according to the opinion  of the head of the investigating team, and the difference should  be properly reflected in the report or in a separate report.    The investigating team should keep the party organization of  the investigated person's unit informed of the main contents of  the investigation report and seek its comments.    Article 35. An informant or witness should be investigated  and blamed for creating trumped-up charges or false testimony or  other actions which obstruct the investigation of a case.    Article 36. The case investigators and handlers, informants,  and witnesses should be protected. Whoever creates trumped-up  charges or retaliates against them should be punished.    Article 37. During the investigation, if a party member who  violated discipline is found to have committed a crime, his case  should be promptly transferred to the judicial organs for  handling.    Article 38. After completing an investigation, the  investigating team should sum up its work and help the party  organization of the unit where the discipline violation took  place in summing up the experience and lessons.    Article 39. The investigation of a case should be completed  in three months, and the period may be extended for one month if  necessary. If a case is too complex and the investigation cannot  be completed within the extended period, the length of the  investigation may be further extended with the approval of the  organ which places the case on file for investigation.    Chapter V. Handing Over a Case for Inquisition    Article 40. All cases placed on file for further  investigation into the party disciplinary responsibility shall  be handed over to the organ concerned for inquisition after the  investigation is completed.    Such an inquisition can be brought in at an earlier stage  during the process of investigating individual cases that are  serious and complicated.    Article 41. When handing over a case for inquisition, the  following matters shall be turned over through a hand-over  procedure:    (1) A written instruction by the leader in charge expressing  his consent to handing over the case for inquisition;    (2) The basis for placing the case on file for further  action;    (3) The investigation report and suggestions of the  discipline inspection office undertaking the investigation;    (4) All evidence;    (5) Facts and evidence of the investigated person's mistakes  that have been discussed with him or her;    (6) The investigated person's written views on the facts and  evidence as well as an examination of his or her mistakes;    (7) The investigation team's explanations on the  investigated person's views.    Article 42. After an inquisition has been conducted on a  case and the result submitted for discussion by the standing  committee of the discipline inspection committee at the same  level, the duplicates of the investigation report, the  investigated person's written views on the facts and evidence as  well as an examination of his or her mistakes, and the  investigation team's explanations on the investigated person's  views shall be turned over to the party organization of the unit  to which the investigated person belongs for a decision on the  way to deal with it.    The party organization of the unit to which the investigated  person belongs shall decide within a month on the way to deal  with the case and shall submit the decision for examination and  approval by a higher authority with the required jurisdiction to  approve the disciplinary action it has decided on.    Under special circumstances, a discipline inspection organ  above the county level shall consult with the party organization  of the unit to which the investigated person belongs before it  directly decides on the disciplinary action.    Article 43. In the course of an inquisition, supplementary  evidence shall be produced if there should be insufficient  evidence, and a supplementary investigation shall be carried out  should there be unclear facts about the case.    Article 44. Discipline inspection organs shall carry out a  direct inquisition on cases already handled by the public  security and judicial organs that involve party members who are  subject to party disciplinary actions. If a case of this nature  should need further investigation, discipline inspection organs  shall go through the formalities for filing the case for further  action.  <H5>  Chapter VI.

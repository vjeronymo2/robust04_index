			<p>920914 FT  14 SEP 92 / Banks meet on Jubilee Line extension BANKS meeting in Toronto today may decide the fate of the Jubilee Line extension to London's docklands and whether a move to acquire Canary Wharf organised by Mr Paul Reichmann, founder of the financially troubled property development, will succeed. The 11 commercial bank lenders to Canary Wharf have been told by the UK government they must submit proposals for a private sector contribution to the cost of the Jubilee Line by the end of September. A banker who will attend the meeting said there was 'no chance' of the banks agreeing on how any Jubilee contribution should be made by that deadline. Another banker said he did not believe the government was 'serious' about the deadline. However a government official said over the weekend that there was no possibility of the Jubilee Line extension being built without a proposal from the banks on a payment by the time next year's public spending is decided. Control of Canary Wharf passed to administrators, under UK insolvency legislation, at the end of May. To date, neither the banks, nor the administrators, who are three partners of Ernst &amp; Young, the accountancy firm, have come up with detailed plans to complete the huge east London property development or fund the Jubilee extension. One banker described this lack of progress as 'a shambles'. However, an investment consortium formed by Mr Paul Reichmann - whose company, Olympia &amp; York, created Canary Wharf - has made the only detailed takeover proposal to be received by the banks. Some banks are opposed to any proposal linked to Mr Reichmann, because they blame him for the huge losses they face on loans to O&amp;Y projects. One European bank said it was implacably opposed. The investment consortium, whose members include Mr Larry Tisch, the media billionaire, Mr Sandy Weill, the financier, and Mr Lewis Ranieri, the investment banker, proposes to lend between Pounds 235m and Pounds 350m to recapitalise Canary Wharf and contribute to the Jubilee Line. The precise amount they lend will depend on two factors: They will provide Pounds 50m less if the administrators sell the freeholds of two Canary Wharf buildings to Texaco, the oil company, and Morgan Stanley, the investment bank. The consortium believes these sales would reduce the project's long-term value. An unfavourable deal on letting office space to the UK government would reduce by Pounds 65m the amount to be lent. Though Mr Reichmann will not provide any of the consortium's capital, he would benefit if its bid were to succeed. The consortium would get 60 per cent of the equity in phases 1 and 2a of Canary Wharf's development and 40 per cent of later phases. However, Mr Reichmann is insisting on getting a 60 per cent equity interest in later phases and 20 per cent of the early phases - leaving the banks with an interest of just 20 per cent of phases 1 and 2a. All the banks reject the consortium's proposal that it should be repaid in full before the banks receive any principal or interest. They also want a higher interest rate than the 5 per cent proposed by the consortium. The consortium however believes that under its proposal banks would eventually be repaid between 82 per cent and 100 per cent of their loans.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Y.C. Tsai] </F>   [Text] Taipei, April 1 (CNA) -- In a new effort to better  protect intellectual property rights, Taiwan will establish the  information product anti-piracy union in late April, the  Information Service Industry Association (ISIA) announced late  Thursday [31 March].    ISIA Secretary-General Arthur Hwa said at a news conference  that the union, aiming to intensify crackdowns on counterfeit  computer products, will be patterned after the US-based business  software alliance (BSA).    More than 30 domestic computer software manufacturers have  decided to join the new union, Hwa noted.    To give a helping hand to Taiwan's anti-piracy efforts, BSA  said the American Alliance has chosen April as "Anti-Piracy  Month" for Taiwan, and will launch a series of activities here  to advocate the importance of protecting innovative information  products from unauthorized use.    BSA will sponsor seminars on software management and offer  incentive measures to encourage Taiwan residents to inform the  alliance of software piracy cases, a spokesman said.    Anyone who provides information which leads to the  indictment, sentencing or out of court settlement of a software  pirate will be rewarded NT$50,000 (US$1,886.79), he elaborated.    Louis Wang, director of the Interior Ministry's Copyright  Committee, hailed the BSA move, saying the anti-piracy drive  will promote the development of a sound, healthy information  industry in Taiwan.    Also speaking at the news conference were Director-General  B.  Lynn Pascoe of the American Institute in Taiwan, Deputy  Director- General Lin Yi-fu of the Board of Foreign Trade, and  Hu Tzu-yin, deputy director-general of the Information Industry  Institute.</p>

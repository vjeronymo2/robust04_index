			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If an agency requests, and the Service concurs, a formal conference report may be issued. A formal conference report on proposed critical habitat contains an opinion that is prepared in accordance with 50 CFR 402.14 as if the critical habitat were designated, not proposed. Such a formal conference report may be adopted as the biological opinion pursuant to 50 CFR 402.10(d) when the critical habitat is designated, if no significant new information has been brought forward and no changes in the action occur that would alter the content of the opinion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Examples of Proposed Actions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 4(b)(8) of the Act requires, for any proposed or final regulation that designates critical habitat, a brief description and evaluation of those activities (public or private) that may adversely modify such habitat or may be affected by such designation. As stated earlier, regulations found at 50 CFR 402.02 define destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat as a direct or indirect alteration that appreciably diminishes the value of critical habitat for both the survival and recovery of a listed species. Such alterations include, but are not limited to, alterations adversely modifying any of those physical or biological features that were the basis for determining the habitat to be critical.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A wide variety of existing and proposed activities may alter or affect proposed marbled murrelet critical habitat. Examples of such activities include, but are not limited to timber harvest, forest management, salvage activities, limbing or modification of limb structure (e.g., for hazard management), mining and mineral exploration, construction of hydroelectric facilities, road construction and refurbishing, and development. Activities that do not alter forest condition, such as some recreational use and personal-use commodity production (e.g., noncommercial mushroom picking, Christmas tree cutting, rock collection) are unlikely to be affected by the proposed designation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Activities conducted according to the standards and guidelines for Late-Successional Reserves, as described in Alternative 9 of the DSEIS for the Proposed Northwest Forest Plan would, in most cases, be unlikely to result in the destruction or adverse modification of proposed marbled murrelet critical habitat. Activities in these areas would be limited to manipulation of young forest stands that are not currently marbled murrelet nesting habitat. Also, these manipulations would be conducted in a manner that would not slow the development of these areas into future nesting habitat and should speed the development of some characteristics of older forest.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Economic and Other Impacts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Act requires the Service to designate critical habitat on the basis of the best scientific data available and to consider the economic and other relevant impacts of specifying any particular area as critical habitat. The Secretary may exclude any area from critical habitat if he determines that the benefits of such exclusion outweigh the benefits of specifying such area as part of the critical habitat, unless he determines, based on the best scientific and commercial data available, that the failure to designate such area as critical habitat will result in the extinction of the species concerned. The Act thus requires the Service to evaluate the economic and other effects likely to result from a designation of critical habitat. Effects attributable to the listing of the species, normal changes in affected industries, or changes in Federal land management that are not caused by the designation are not regarded as effects of the designation of critical habitat. However, due to the complex interplay of economic and other forces, separating impacts associated solely with the designation of critical habitat from other impacts is often difficult.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> February 12, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ REVIEW ;  </P> <P> WATTS' EXPERIMENTAL TRIO HAS A SENSE OF HUMOR  </P> <P> "I don't know what it is, but it's not jazz" were the words of caution firmly  spoken by a member of the audience between sets Friday night at Le Cafe, where  a drum-less trio fronted by saxophonist Ernie Watts began a two-night stint.  </P> <P> The caution was overstated as Watts, pianist Peter Robinson and bassist Joel  DiBartolo provided an impressive second set of original compositions that  challenged the ear and stimulated the mind. True, the group did not present  jazz from any of the traditional bags, but the concepts and improvisational  spirit evidenced the players' familiarity with the territories of bop, blues  and the mainstream.  </P> <P> The late-night set before a full house at the intimate Sherman Oaks nightery  began with "Echoes," an attractive swing piece from Watts that recalled the  influence of John Coltrane, Cannonball Adderley and other jazz saxophone  greats. The piece, wide ranging in scope and style, provided an apt setting for  Watts' inspired tenor sax melodies and established the trio's ability to create  distinctive, propelling rhythm patterns without the aid of drums.  </P> <P> Just as compelling and effective were several moments when an arrhythmic  approach was taken, as in Robinson's beautifully wrought "Lullaby" and the  following "Phoenix Rising," the former played without DiBartolo's bass. Both  compositions featured stark, plaintive melodies that Watts, playing both tenor  and soprano, and Robinson explored with deft musicality.  </P> <P> DiBartolo's musicianship was extraordinary throughout the set, his walking  lines providing rhythmic impetus and harmonic movement on such tunes as "On the  Border," which featured a funk backdrop from Robinson, and "Blues in H," a  note-laden piece that showed there is indeed room for humor in jazz.  </P> <P> The teaming of Watts, Robinson and DiBartolo is a good one. Lacking in pretense  (as so many experimental groups are not), this trio successfully served  inspired musicianship in an entertaining format. Who could ask for anything  more?  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vadim Mikhnevich, DELOVOY MIR: "Stock Market: </F> Fighting Under a Patchwork Quilt"]    [Text] The securities market will have nothing in  common with investments until the State Committee on the  Administration of State Property, the Ministry of Finance, and  the Central Bank stop pulling it apart, fighting for spheres of  influence. This was discussed at the hearings of problems of the  stock market organized by the Commission on Securities and Stock  Exchanges. Representatives of the capital's and regional stock  exchanges, investment companies, and broker firms, who were  invited to the hearings, accused the commission of a lack of  professionalism, demanded the inclusion of their representatives  in its membership, and nicknamed what was happening around the  stock market fighting under a patchwork quilt. The Union of  Stock Exchanges spoke out even more sharply at the press  conference, which it held immediately upon the conclusion of the  hearings.  <H5>  Welcome to the Shadow Economy </H5>   The Union of Stock Exchanges sent an appeal to the Russian  Federation President, in which it warned him about the  consequences of the actions of the State Committee on the  Administration of State Property, the Ministry of Finance, and  the Central Bank, which were pushing the securities market into  the criminal sphere. The appeal stressed that the situation on  the stock market was approaching the critical level and was  developing toward the emergence of a new wave of scandals and  exposures, which would definitively undermine the population's  and investors' confidence in privatization and in the securities  market.    The paradox lies in the fact that representatives of  precisely these three departments form the nucleus of the  Commission on Securities and Stock Exchanges under the Russian  Federation President. In the absence of legislation presidential  edicts must regulate the process of privatization and the  mechanism of the securities market. One can only guess what  information the president receives from the commission. However,  as Yuriy Milyukov (the Moscow Commodity Exchange) and Igor  Suvorov (the Russian Stock Exchange), presidents of the  capital's two exchanges, and Aleksandr Deryabin, director of the  International Stock Market Institute, stated, the commission  works inefficiently, unprofessionally, and in a disinterested  manner and represents only the interests of its constituent  departments. It deliberately ignores the experience and  intellectual potential of practical stock exchange experts and,  counter to the president's decision, does everything to remove  them from participation in the preparation of draft laws and the  elaboration of recommendations for market regulation.    Incidentally, participants in the hearings, who were not  sparing of epithets directed against the commission, also fully  shared this point of view. The essence of their statements  boiled down to the fact that market regulation occurred  according to the principle "to rule and not let go!", whereas  the situation on the stock market and the course of  privatization required the adoption of thought-out and balanced  decisions, especially during the period of absence of  legislative acts.    In this situation it is significant that at the state level  no one is responsible for the securities market. The commission  operates not on a permanent, but, in fact, on a voluntary,  basis. Nevertheless, collective irresponsibility does not rule  out at all the adoption by the Ministry of Finance and the State  Committee on the Administration of State Property of decisions,  which, according to Igor Suvorov, push the securities market  into crime. The scheme is as follows: At first the shifting of  operations with securities from the exchange sector to the  nonexchange sector, then transition to cash transactions, and,  finally, departure for the shadow economy. If we are guided by  statistics, Suvorov is right: The nonexchange turnover on the  securities market already exceeds greatly the exchange turnover  and, according to forecasts, this is a steady trend.    Another trend--the increase in the confrontation between  stock exchanges and the State Committee on the Administration of  State Property, the Ministry of Finance, and the Central  Bank--can also be called steady. There are ample complaints. The  Ministry of Finance is accused of appropriating the right to  decide individually what is and is not a security; the State  Committee on the Administration of State Property, of the  attempt to divert the stock market to the nonexchange turnover  and to deprive it of transparency, that is, openness and  reliable information; of attempts to place the stock market  under control through the establishment of so-called  self-regulating organizations operating under the control of the  State Committee on the Administration of State Property. As  affirmed, this is done only in the interest of officials, who  are threatened with unemployment upon the conclusion of voucher  privatization.    On their part representatives of the mentioned state  structures and of the Central Bank maintain that strict control  by them hinders unscrupulous issuers, investors, and middlemen.  A totally absurd situation arises, when opposing sides, guided,  according to them, by totally good intentions, are forced to  observe how criminal structures ever more actively interfere in  the process of privatization and gradually become established on  the securities market.  <H5>  A Fight Where There Will Be No Winners </H5>   Ultimately, the solution of the problem concerning the  further fate of the securities market depends on the choice of  what path to follow: To give preference to strict state  regulation, or to rely on natural objective processes operating  in the market economy.    State management bodies rely on the former, and the Union of  Stock Exchanges on the latter. In theory, compromise options are  also possible. However, state structures, frightened by  privatization, which is getting out of control, a fact recently  acknowledged by Anatoliy Chubays, will hardly go for this. In  addition to the introduction of order, which lies within the  range of official duties, they will have to save their own  reputation, because today the mechanism of privatization is  subjected to criticism from right and left.    However, no matter how clumsy privatization may seem, the  interests of the parties concerned have already become clear.  Privatized enterprises need money. Most of them not only do not  have assets for production development, but, in general, are  without circulating capital. They can get them either from the  state budget, or from bank credits, or through a free sale on  the securities market. If we take into account that the state  treasury is empty, while the rates of interest on credit are  high, emission is the only real way of attracting capital.  Moreover, as experts believe, the establishment of a highly  liquid stock market is the most efficient, as well as cheaper,  method of activating investments.    The Union of Stock Exchanges has already examined this  matter  repeatedly. What should be done? First, it is possible to more  rapidly adopt a series of legislative acts regulating the rights  and duties of investors and issuers, as well as stockholders.  The system of guarantees for the return of investments should  also be formalized legislatively, without which no one will  begin to invest money in production.    Then it is necessary to regulate the system of mutual  settlements in order to ensure conditions for the transfer of  capital. Today this is impossible, because, as Suvorov cleverly  noted, the Central Bank established concentration camps for  money, where it loses value owing to inflation.    It is also necessary to determine our position on the  technological base--depositaries and the recording of the  movement of shares. At any moment the issuer must know how much  he owes and to whom. This also includes the establishment of an  efficient information space, which makes it possible not only to  judge what is sold and where, but also to obtain exhausting  information on issuers. It should be easily available to  all--both private stockholders and big investors. Then a barrier  will be placed against false advertising.    It is necessary to train personnel, because in most cases  the  skills of middlemen operating on the stock market leave much to  be desired. In general, it is not important who will issue  licenses. It is only important that this be done according to a  single form and within a strict framework of uniform demands on  middlemen.    Finally, it is necessary to establish in the law guarantees  for owners' rights and mechanisms for the resolution of  conflicts.    Yuriy Milyukov, Igor Suvorov, and Aleksandr Deryabin believe  that in many respects the crisis on the stock market has been  created artificially. The reason: The fight for spheres of  influence among officials, a fight, in which there will be  everything except winners.  <H5>  Who Should Prepare the Package of Laws? </H5>   As it turns out, today this is the question of questions. If  we proceed from the rules of procedure, the Commission on  Securities and Stock Exchanges should submit projects for  hearings to the State Duma. However, subjects of the market do  not trust the commission. The satisfaction of their demand to  include their representatives in the commission's membership  seems very doubtful and does not frighten officials especially.  As one of the presidium members remarked in passing, if you  insist, submit a list. The staff will examine it in accordance  with the established procedure, after which it will be submitted  to the president for approval.    One can say right away what will come out of this: While the  paper circulates among the authorities, no time will be left to  work out proposals. What will the State Duma adopt?    For now the audience's attention has been called to three  versions of laws. Two of them--the Law on the Securities Market  and the Law on Investment Securities--were drafted in the  Administration of Securities of the Central Bank. Two others--On  Securities and Stock Exchanges and On Investment Securities and  Stock Exchanges--were drafted by groups of independent experts.  However, having received texts 1/2 hour before the beginning of  the meeting, participants did not begin to spend time on  studying them, having decided to give this to experts and to  hear at the next meeting, where the commission would have to  deal not with representatives of uncoordinated broker firms, but  with especially delegated professionals.    Possibly, proposals will also follow from the State  Committee  on the Administration of State Property, which immediately after  the hearings promulgated its concept of postvoucher  privatization. For now it does not say a word about the  securities market.    Thus, the countdown has begun and, as Anatoliy Chubays  sensibly noted, it works against us.    Experts assume that, if the opposing sides do not manage to  attain a balance of interests, the stock market in Russia may  not exist. That is, securities, of course, will circulate on it,  but enterprises in need of an inflow of investments will not  receive even a penny from this.  <H5>  Alas, the Fate of Stockholders Is Not in Their Hands </H5>   Although today two out of three Russians are stockholders,  no  one can really say what they will have from this. Most of them  are in the position of Pinocchio in the Land of the Fools.  Having been burned by voucher privatization, it is unlikely that  they will begin to chase after the shares of newly appeared  issuers. This seriously worries the founders of privatization,  because everyone knows that the population has money available.    Today one can say with good reason that the investment  crisis  is based on the confidence crisis. On the other hand, it is  already clear that the reforming of securities is meaningless  without the reforming of other fields; for example, of the  banking and tax system. The opposition quite justly reproaches  the government for the lack of an integrated approach to  reforms. One has to believe Aleksandr Livshits, director of the  group of experts under the president, who declared at the  hearings that he would like to find in the corridors of power at  least one person seriously concerned about this problem.    Stock market experts are almost unanimous in the opinion  that  without the consolidation of efforts in all directions it will  not be possible to create an effective mechanism of circulation  of securities. If so, just as we do not see our ears, we will  not see a civilized stock market operating in the interest of  issuers, middlemen, and stockholders. The circulation of capital  will continue, but it will only unleash inflation. Money will  make money, but production will lose its priority.    Possibly, by the next hearings, which are to be held in 3  months, the commission's membership will be renewed. Then two  scenarios are possible: Either at least outlines of an accord  with the interests of the subjects of the market will emerge, or  the fighting arena will move to the commission.    And, finally, the last. Possibly, organizers of the hearings  were sorry that they invited the press to them. Journalists did  not have to chase after an interview. Participants went to the  press center on their own in order to share urgent problems;  especially representatives of regions, who complained about the  unprofessionalism of regional administrations of the Ministry of  Finance, arbitrariness of local authorities, confusion with the  normative base, lack of information from Moscow, excessive  taxes, corruption, and invasion of organized crime into the  process of privatization. Answering my question concerning  promises by Anatoliy Chubays and Dmitriy Vasilyev, the  representative of a Rostov broker firm answered as follows:  "This is like a dream! I am walking and squinting my eyes..."</p>

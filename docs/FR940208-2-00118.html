Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> On April 26, 1993, the Commission approved until April 30, 1994, NSCC's proposed rule change that established its pilot program to provide direct clearing type services for participants located in New York City (``New York Window'' or ``NYW''). <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>  NSCC was asked by several participants to provide such services because New York City participants have been experiencing a continual decline in their activities associated with the processing of physical securities. This decline in activities is a result of the increasing depository eligibility of securities that previously had been settled physically. Consequently, these participants no longer find it desirable to maintain their own window operations. NSCC originally requested approval of the NYW program on a pilot basis because NSCC was seeking to operate the individual participants' window programs at NSCC. After operating the pilot for a period of time, NSCC was to evaluate the program to determine whether any changes should be made and whether to expand and standardize the operations. NSCC is still in the process of evaluating the NYW program and at this time is not ready to implement a standardized, proprietary program to replace the individual participants' operations. <FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>  Therefore, NSCC is requesting that the NYW pilot program be extended. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=2 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=2 --> For a detailed description of the NYW program and a discussion of the various legal, regulatory, and operational issues, refer to Securities Exchange Act Release No. 32221  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  note 3. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> NSCC is planning to implement a proprietary New York Window program during the third quarter of 1994, which will necessitate the filing of a proposed rule change under section 19(b)(2) of the Act. Telephone conversation between Karen Saperstein, Vice President/Director of Legal and Associate General Counsel, NSCC, and Jerry W. Carpenter, Branch Chief, and Peter R. Geraghty, Attorney, Division of Market Regulation, Commission (January 26, 1994). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2.

NSCC will not issue such checks until it has verified the receipt of same-day funds from each participant in an amount equal to the gross amount of each participant's payment obligations for that day. To the extent that the NYW processes ``deliveries'' that result in next-day funds credits for each participant, NSCC will pay each participant the aggregate amount of all checks received and deposited by NSCC for the participant each day. The payments will be made in same-day funds on the day following receipt and deposit by NSCC of the checks. To the extent that receives or deliveries processed by the NYW result in same-day funds debits and credits, the wire transfers will continue to be made directly between the NYW participants and the other parties to the transactions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NSCC has stated that the proposed rule change will be implemented consistent with NSCC's statutory obligation under section 17A of the Act to safeguard securities and funds in NSCC's custody or control. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

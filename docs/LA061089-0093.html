			<p><P> June 10, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AN OUTCRY BY KOREAN CHRISTIANS  </P> <P> Korean Christians in Southern California have raised an outcry over  recommendations on the reunification of North and South Korea issued by a  conference organized by the National Council of Churches.  </P> <P> The statement adopted at the April 23-26 conference in Washington, which  included several North and South Korean pastors, said Americans should support  proposals for withdrawal of U.S. troops and nuclear weapons from South Korea  and should focus sympathetic attention on rallies and demonstrations by Korean  people for peace and justice.  </P> <P> A committee formed in Los Angeles by prominent Korean-American pastors has  drawn up a counterstatement declaring that no moves should be made to remove  the U.S. military presence in South Korea "until North Korea gives up its  ambition to reunify Korea under communist rule . . . and North Korea has  churches all over the country and allows people to worship."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Seen as Key Issue  </P> <P> "This is a major issue in the Korean community," said Myung K. Kim, publisher  of the weekly Korean-language Christian Herald in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 8,000 Signatures  </P> <P> About 8,000 signatures have been gathered endorsing the counterstatement from  Korean-Americans living in Southern California, Kim said.  </P> <P> A protest march and demonstration are planned for Sunday afternoon in  Koreatown, and a Korean Christian prayer rally in the Shrine Auditorium next  Thursday, Friday and Saturday night will focus further attention on the issue,  Kim said.  </P> <P> The April conference on Korean reunification did not make much news outside the  Korean-American community except for the apparently unprecedented visit to the  U.S. by a four-man church delegation from communist-ruled North Korea.  </P> <P> Heading the group of two pastors and two interpreters was the Rev. Ko Gi Jun,  general secretary of the Korean Christians Federation, which he said represents  10,000 Christians in North Korea with the freedom to worship in about 500 "home  churches."  </P> <P> But three Korean Christian pastors interviewed this week in Los Angeles were  skeptical. Reports from the Washington conference, at which delegates sang  Korean hymns and read Scripture, indicated that "two of them could not sing the  hymns at all and they did not seem to locate Bible passages very well,"  according to the Rev. Dong Sun Lim, senior pastor of the large Oriental Mission  Church in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Head of Volunteer Group  </P> <P> Lim heads a Christian group that has volunteered to help establish churches in  North Korea once freedom of religious expression is guaranteed by the  government. Lim was to travel there recently as head of a 32-man delegation for  that purpose, but he backed down because of insufficient assurances, he said.  Nine members of the group decided to go as individuals, and recently returned.  </P> <P> "They asked to see just one of the 500 'underground' churches and (North Korean  officials) couldn't show them any," Lim said.  </P> <P> The Rev. Chun Il Cho, pastor of the Korean Philadelpia Presbyterian Church in  Los Angeles, said the counterstatement was sponsored by the Council of Korean  Churches in Southern California and the Southern California Korean Ministers  Assn.  </P> <P> The positions taken by the National Council of Churches and its counterpart  Council of Churches in South Korea are "minority" viewpoints both in South  Korea and in this country, the Los Angeles pastors said.  </P> <P> "Until we see freedom of religion in North Korea and that church people can  move freely from one country to the other, we would like to see (U.S. troops)  kept in South Korea," said the Rev. Sungsoo Whang, pastor of Los Angeles  Presbyterian Church. Whang also said the April conference statement also would  have the effect of inciting further agitation in South Korea, some of which he  claimed was communist-inspired.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Minority Position  </P> <P> A National Council of Churches official conceded in a telephone interview that  the conference took what is regarded as a minority position. "That is  indisputable," said Duane Epps, assistant general secretary for international  affairs at the National Council headquarters in New York.  </P> <P> "But the church, when it has been effective in history, has done what the  Gospel has mandated it to do, to be faithful to the message of love and  reconciliation," Epps said.  </P> <P> Epps felt that the rapport between the North Korean church representatives,  South Korean churchmen and Korean-American delegates was warm and authentic.  "It was a rather fundamental breakthrough," he said.  </P> <P> Epps said that the Washington statement did not address the question of what  needs to be done in North Korea to achieve reunification because "this  particular conference was to discuss U.S. policy and the responsibility of U.S.  churches vis-a-vis their government." He said a more balanced policy statement  on the Koreas, which formed the background to the conference, was adopted by  the National Council of Churches Governing Board in 1986.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Opposition Voiced  </P> <P> Two former moderators of the Korean Presbyterian Church in America, a National  Council member since 1986, were present at the Washington conference "and did  not indicate opposition to the statement," Epps said.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles pastors said they did not know the opinions of those  representatives, but suggested that Koreans customarily keep quiet about their  objections in the face of an overwhelming consensus.  </P> <P> Whang added that the Rev. Keyong Kim, senior pastor of Young Nak Presbyterian  Church, the largest congregation in that denomination, is one of the leading  organizers of the petition drive to oppose the reunification conference  statement.  </P></p>

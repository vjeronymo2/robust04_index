			<p><P> December 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> I'd like to compliment Michael DeLorenzo, who plays Alex Torres on "Head of the  Class," for being a true sight to watch every Wednesday night. Up until now, I  wasn't a devout fan of the series, but with the additional characters, I find  the show very appealing.  </P> <P> Reina Holt, Los Angeles  </P></p>

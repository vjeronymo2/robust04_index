			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / London Stock Exchange: Wellcome worries increase FURTHER selling of Wellcome prompted suggestions from some dealers that the planned share issue might have to be scaled down to take account of market weakness. Pressure from two small securities houses and from the options market was said to be behind a fall of 12 to 833p in the shares yesterday. Wellcome is now an even tighter market than usual, with few traders prepared to buy stock ahead of next week's share flotation. Wellcome Trust, the governing charity, is hoping to sell 330m shares through investment bank Robert Fleming, although some dealers were suggesting yesterday that the flotation might have to be scaled back to 200m. Fleming has said it has received indicative bids for more than 250m shares and is understood to be convinced that UK institutions will be happy to buy Wellcome stock at around 800p when the tender process ends on Friday. However, if the price continues to fall, institutions could find themselves in the bizarre situation of paying for the floated shares at a premium to the price in the market. Reuters above worst A sharp fall for Reuters shares following the group's interim results surprised many in the market. The stock tumbled 70 from the day's high, but picked up later to close a net 25 off at 1126p on further consideration of the company's trading report. Marketmakers focused initially on a newswire headline which appeared to indicate that revenues, rather than the percentage growth, would be under pressure. However, further appraisal showed that the first-half profit of Pounds 187.4m was towards the upper end of forecasts and cash holdings were strong at Pounds 600m. Mr John Clarke of Daiwa, the Japanese securities house, commented: 'The earnings are of the very highest quality. With cash continuing to increase there is no reason for Reuters to lose its premium rating.' BA advances News that British Airways is to pay Dollars 750m for a 21 per cent voting stake in USAir, America's fourth largest carrier, was well received in the stock market. Share volume in BA soared to 10m in strong two-way business as the stock advanced 10 to 268p. Earlier, the shares had moved forward in light trade with the market, but the announcement drove the stock to a day's peak of 275p, before profit-takers arrived. Mr Chris Tarry at Kleinwort Benson Securities said: 'This deal goes much of the way to combat competition from BA's main US rivals, United Airlines and American Airlines.' Another analyst, however, commented: 'British Airways appears to have paid a high price in a buyers' market.' Enterprise weak The focus of attention among oil exploration and production stocks shifted away from Lasmo and moved to Enterprise Oil as its shares retreated 13 more to 319p, their lowest since April 1988. The price was unsettled early by the sale of a block of 400,000 shares at 319p, a 7p discount to the prevailing market price. The move accompanied growing unease about lack of news on the expected sale of Enterprise's stake in the Hudson field in the North Sea. Sector specialists have been waiting for many weeks for news of the Hudson sale, which is expected to raise around Pounds 25m. C. Itoh, the Japanese holding company, has been rumoured to be the buyer of the stake. HSBC put on 7 to 346p, responding to much better than expected figures from Marine Midland, the bank's US subsidiary. Monday's rally in Lasmo came to an abrupt halt, with the shares slipping 4 1/2 to 126 1/2 p on good turnover of 3.2m in the wake of some determined selling by one of the leading London brokers. There was a suggestion that one of the UK banks, a big corporate lender to the oil sector, had revised downwards its oil price forecasts and was reducing its revolving credit facilities to some oil groups. BP settled 3 up at 203p after confirmation of the biggest ever traded options deal in the UK market, involving the equivalent of 20m BP shares. Strong hints in the market that British Steel's broker, UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, had taken the stock off its buy list led to a retreat in the share price which made it the day's worst performing component of the FT-SE 100 Index. The shares gave up 2 1/2 to 56 1/2 p in brisk trade of 11m amid suggestions that the broker had cast doubts about the level of this year's dividend. Simon Engineering fell 16 to 190p after broker Smith New Court downgraded its current-year dividend expectation. The market responded well to first-half results from SmithKline Beecham, the 'A' shares appreciating 13 1/2 to 457p and the units 12 to 412p. Profits of Pounds 254m were at the top of a Pounds 248m to Pounds 254m market forecast range. SmithKline announced a dividend of 2.075p which was in line with expectations and several houses were recommending the stock. Glaxo saw healthy trade following good buying in New York on Monday night. The stock moved ahead 28 to 716p, principally boosted by the company's defensive qualities. Lehman has been telling clients that sales in the UK of the oral version of the company's anti-migraine drug Imigran could have reached Dollars 30m (Pounds 15.7m) this year. Newsagent John Menzies maintained a firm tone after Monday's better than expected results led to an upgrading by County NatWest. The securities house said it is looking for profits of Pounds 28m next year, compared with a previous estimate of Pounds 25.5m. The shares gained 2 to 385p. Northern Foods rallied 10 to 594p, after losing ground on Monday ahead of this week's annual meeting. Property shares bounced following the recent spate of depressing statistics showing an all-time low for the sector against the FT-Actuaries All-share Index. Broker recommendations helped British Land to improve 3 to 184p and Slough Estates 5 to 122p. Growing belief that Greycoat would maintain its dividend left the stock 5 firmer at 33p. Mirror Group Newspapers gained a further 5 to 63 1/2 p on heavy turnover of 16m shares as talk that a stakebuilder is at work refused to die away. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1992 NEW HIGHS (6).

			<p><P> September 6, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE: FTC COULD VOID DEALS BETWEEN ABC AND CFA  </P> <P> The Federal Trade Commission filed an administrative complaint against the  College Football Assn. and Capital Cities-ABC Inc. Wednesday, saying their  television contracts are anti-competitive.  </P> <P> The five-page complaint, a copy of which was obtained by the Associated Press,  said competition among schools and networks for college football games has been  hindered and that "consumers have been deprived of the selection of college  football games that would otherwise have been televised in a competitive  environment."  </P> <P> The FTC asked that the CFA and Capital Cities appear before an administrative  law judge on Nov. 13 in Washington. The FTC could void the national television  contracts and prohibit the CFA from negotiating new deals for all its members.  </P> <P> ABC currently televises games under a contract with the Big Ten and the Pacific  10 conferences. The CFA's contracts with CBS expire after this season, and the  CFA is scheduled to begin a new deal with ABC in 1991.  </P> <P> The CFA is composed of 64 schools from all major conferences except the Big Ten  and the Pacific 10. The association announced that the complaint was filed  after Lew Engman, its Washington lawyer, received the papers.  </P> <P> "We are disappointed that the FTC has decided to file a complaint against the  CFA," the association said in a statement at its Boulder, Colo., office. "Such  action, however, should not be construed as a finding that the CFA has acted  unlawfully, but rather as an initiation of the formal hearing process."  </P> <P> ABC Sports spokesman Mark Mandel said the network did not have a comment since  it had not yet seen the complaint. The FTC scheduled a news conference today to  discuss the complaint.  </P></p>

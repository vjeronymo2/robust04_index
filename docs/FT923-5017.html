			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: Invergordon Yesterday's 11 per cent increase in interim profits from Invergordon made a refreshing change to a dull diet of depressed earnings. The management's strong grip on the business is demonstrated by increasing margins and market share, in spite of falls in wholesale whisky prices. True, the performance is flattered by recession, as consumers switch to cheap scotch. Nevertheless Invergordon's success in this own-label market is impressive. That said, the spectre at the feast is Whyte &amp; Mackay's 41 per cent stake in the company. Given the value Whyte clearly places on Invergordon's grain distillery and whisky stocks, a fresh bid seems likely when it is free to renew its assault in November. But with Whyte probably having to pay 50p-75p more than last year's failed 275p offer, there is room for doubt. Whisky prices are weakening, and at the same time, Invergordon stands at a premium to the sector. If prices continue to ease, Whyte may just decide that it can get the shares cheaper if it waits.</p>

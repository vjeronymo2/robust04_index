			<p>BFN     [Text] Today the presidents of the 102 People's Councils of  the city of Havana analyzed the support these organizations are  to provide in monitoring the new national medications program  that will go into in effect as of tomorrow in this capital.  Provincial health director Dr. Pastor Castell explained that  this plan seeks to gradually ensure that the necessary medicines  are physically supplied by the medical-pharmaceutical industry,  to perfect distribution, and to link every welfare institution  to a particular pharmacy. Castell explained that the success of  the new program also depends on knowing in advance what  medicines these pharmacies have and, in keeping with this,  prescribing those medicines to one's patients. Castell said that  among the plan's objectives are to get the medications to  whoever really needs them and to have the population feel  satisfied. The plan will also combat speculation or illegal  sales of medicines that are in short supply.</p>

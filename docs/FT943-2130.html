			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / Date set for MPs' new session The state opening of parliament has been set for November 16. MPs are due to return from the summer recess on October 17, leaving the government four weeks to complete outstanding business from the 1993-94 session. The only Commons business left to be dealt with is the criminal justice bill, with MPs still to debate Lords amendments. Peers have still to complete consideration of three measures: the European Union accession bill, the deregulation and contracting out bill and the local government Scotland bill.</p>

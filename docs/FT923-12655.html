			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / Bush and Clinton vie for votes as Perot quits race THERE will not be a President Ross Perot nor even a candidate Ross Perot. The billionaire Texas businessman yesterday said he was abandoning his independent bid for the White House. The announcement came as Governor Bill Clinton prepared to deliver his nomination acceptance speech to the Democratic convention in New York last night. Both Mr Clinton and President George Bush made a rapid pitch to pick up the supporters of the erstwhile independent. After telephone calls to the Perot camp, both reported warm conversations and claimed to represent the sort of change Mr Perot wanted. Mr Perot said that with the Democratic party now revived, he had concluded that, if he ran, the November election would leave no outright winner and the presidency would have to be decided early in the new year in the House of Representatives. The country could not afford such a hiatus and any new president was entitled to have the time between the election and the inauguration to form a new government, he said. Mr Perot did not endorse Mr Bush nor Mr Clinton. He urged his volunteers to continue to register his name on state ballots so the other parties would have ready-made lists of those concerned about the state of the country. His presence on the ballot could still make him a factor in some states, but, judging by calls to radio and TV talk shows, many supporters felt betrayed. Mr Perot said he thought the Democrats had done 'a brilliant job' in reviving themselves and blamed the Bush administration for a number of severe problems, including the federal deficit. He also appeared to favour a strong president working with a party of the same persuasion in Congress, which is likely to remain in Democratic hands. Asked repeatedly at a press conference to say whether this constituted a preference, he responded: 'I was afraid you'd get that impression', adding he was endorsing nobody. Mr Perot's withdrawal came less than a day after the resignation of Mr Ed Rollins, his senior campaign manager, and as polls showed his popularity plummeting. A Washington Post/ABC survey showed Mr Clinton at 45 per cent, Mr Bush on 28 per cent and Mr Perot down to 20 per cent. A poll last night by the New York Daily News gave Mr Clinton 45 per cent and Mr Bush 33 per cent in a two-man race. The text of Mr Clinton's planned speech to the convention, was upbeat and designed to reveal more of his personality and roots in the country he wants to lead. Its climax was a reference to his birthplace in Arkansas, but he also affirmed other values. 'I am a product of America's middle class and when I am your president you will not be forgotten,' he said.

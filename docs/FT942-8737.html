			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / Building workers to vote on 2.5% A pay deal worth about 2.5 per cent was agreed last night for Britain's 600,000 building and civil engineering workers between employers and unions. The proposals will be put to the workers with a union recommendation that they should accept it, Robert Taylor writes. An employers' spokesman said: 'Both sides recognised the difficulties the industry has gone through over the past four years of recession and they regard the offer as realistic in the circumstances.' Rates of pay for a normal 39-hour week would go up from June 27. The guaranteed minimum earnings for a craft operative would rise to Pounds 163.41 from Pounds 159.51 and for a labourer to Pounds 139.23 from Pounds 135.91.</p>

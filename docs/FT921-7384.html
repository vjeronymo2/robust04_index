			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / Travel: A devil-may-care voodoo society - A group of beggars welcomes Ian Thomson to Port-au-Prince, capital of Haiti. Travelling around, he finds that the national sport is cock-fighting, and religion and voodoo hold a poor people in thrall HAITI IS A hairy place. When Alec Waugh told his friends that he was going there for a holiday, they raised their eyebrows. 'Haiti,' they said. 'But that's where they kill their presidents and eat their babies. You'd better buy yourself a large-sized gun'. But I could not afford a gun. I was about to fly from Miami into a state of perilous upheaval and felt nervous. 'Man, you gonna lay your life on the line out there in Hay-di,' the taxi-driver informed me on the way to the airport. 'They're killin' people like flies'. I clung to the passenger-strap and closed my eyes. 'Best of British,' grinned the cabbie. The flight passed without incident. As the aircraft rolled smoothly along the tarmac at Port-au-Prince, Haiti's capital, a group of beggars in tattered straw hats were shaking maracas at the entrance to Immigration. 'Bienvenu blanc]' they grinned. Then a boy approached selling trumpery wooden carvings. 'Give me one dollar]' It was a relief to find that Customs were quite perfunctory. 'Purpose of visit?' I was asked. Tourism, I said, to which the official replied: 'Very good, m'sieur. Tomorrow belongs to Haiti, because Haiti means business'. The evening sky over Port-au-Prince was stained with a reddish light, shimmering slightly. It was hot and muggy. I went straight to the Hotel Oloffson. This is a colonial clapboard mansion made famous by Graham Greene in his Haitian novel, The Comedians. There are wobbly overhead fans but very few tourists. A complimentary cocktail of Barbencourt rum awaited me on the wicker table in my room. I drank a stiff measure and fell asleep. Port-au-Prince by day is a study in bedlam. The main roads are choc-a-bloc with public buses known colloquially as tap-taps from the noise of their vintage engines which emit a tapping sound as they labour over hills. Most of these are Peugeot 404s converted into tuppeny jitneys, and they list perilously to starboard under the weight of human cargo, belching plumes of diesel smoke. Painted in crude colours like the horse-drawn carts of Sicily, tap-taps evidently reflect the temperament and tastes of the people. There is the Haitian flair for pageantry: masonic pentacles, fantastic flamingoes, palm trees. The more flamboyant these decorations, the greater the driver's status, rather like the number of tattoos on a man's forearm. There is also history: lurid representations of the national heroes Jean-Jacques Dessalines and Toussaint L'Ouverture, their playing-card sabres encrusted with precious stones. Above all, there is religion. Many buses are decorated with quotations from the Old Testament, particularly from the Book of Numbers: 'The one lamb thou shalt offer in the morning; the other lamb thou shalt offer at even . . .' A tap-tap is Haiti in miniature, surreal as a Dali canvas. The market at Port-au-Prince - a block square of bawling and bargaining - is a great arched iron structure painted red and green. It is not unlike an oriental bazaar, with minaret-domes that might have come from Agra or Fetehpur Sikri in India. One is constantly pestered by money-changers - 'Pssst] Pssst]'  - and by hucksters bent double under prodigious loads of contraband. The swarming, clanging, shouting hell of the market may overwhelm, but it is the best place in which to buy Haitian paintings, raffia bags, globular straw baskets or Ali Baba jars of unusual design. Things are very different outside the capital, where the air is fresh and vital and tropical plains lie under a vault of blue sky. I took a tap-tap to Jacmel, a provincial town on the southern coast of Haiti. Jacmel was once a thriving colonial port. Steamships would sail there every month from Southampton, bringing British tweeds in exchange for coffee. The place is now in decline, but the gingerbread mansions have considerable charm. The Hotel Alexandra is a magnificent clapboard affair cluttered with French antiques, many conserved under sheets behind a locked door. The proprietor, a diminutive mulatto of fearsome aspect, will arrange a journey by horse to the bassin bleu in the hills nearby. It is a rough and unfrequented trail that winds along a steep chasm, fording streams made almost impassable by rain. But it is well worth the discomfort, as the bassin is a series of natural aquifers, the waters of which are an amazing blue-green from dissolved limestone. Jacmel is a good place in which to witness a gaguere, cockfight. This is not for faint-hearts, but it is the national sport of Haiti: what the bull-fight is to Spain. Tourists are shown to the best ringside positions. Wads of cash are circulated among the crowd by touts and tipsters as the antagonists are carried squawking into the cockpit. Feathers have been clipped, combs cropped and made flush with meticulous care. There is a very complicated toilet as the seconds each take a mouthful of water from a calabash and, pressing the birds to their lips, suck and spray their plumage so that it adheres flat to their bodies and affords the opponent little hold. More bets are placed as the men bend down to make the sign of the cross in the dust. Finally, the man who has been collecting the wagers blows a tin whistle and the fight begins. At first the gamecocks circle each other cautiously, like boxers seeking an opening; then they shoot up in the air with talons interlocked, feathers taunted into ruffs. The spectators crane forward from their benches to encourage or jeer at the contest, screaming and waving their arms. A hurrah  -'Woaah]'  - or cry of dismay  - 'Haii]' - goes up whenever one of the birds is pecked in the eyes. The contenders close with each other again. A whirr of wings and a savage peck - 'Haii]'  - sends feathers floating about the cockpit like down from a pillow fight. Then a bird spins round and collapses - 'Woaah]' - like an alcoholic, one wing hanging open, its breast torn of plumage. With a whoop of jubilation from the crowd, it keels over into the dust. Straw hats fly into the air as the victor spreads its wings and shrills a triumphant cockadoodledoo. I remember glancing with a qualm of repulsion at my shirt-front; it was speckled with blood. Religion is the mainstay of Haitian society: voodoo and Catholicism. It is said that Haitains are 80 per cent Roman Catholic and 100 per cent voodooist. Religion is perhaps all that remains for the voiceless poor of Haiti: the spirits of distant Africa, the cross of Christianity. The twin-spired pink-and-white cathedral of Port-au-Prince resembles the Sacre Coeur in Paris. A massive shrine to the Virgin, swathed in wreaths of pink tulle, stands in the parquet transept. Tasselled standards embroidered with numerous injunctions from the Bible line the aisles. There is a scent of dying flowers and burial candlewicks. Often I saw a crowd of wailing women round the Madonna. Many would prostrate themselves in supplication, lying prone with faces pressed against the floor, clutching in one hand a lighted candle, a rosary in the other. Some curious votive offerings had been placed at the Madonna's plaster feet: a small mirror, a white silk handkerchief, empty bottles of Cinzano and Madeira. These were objects left in honour of Erzulie Freda, an African divinity of Dahomean origin who is mirrored in Catholicism by the Virgin Mary. The celebrants wailing before me in the cathedral were respectful of both Erzulie and the Madonna; Christianity has never triumphed over voodoo for the simple reason that voodoo itself has always been receptive to elements from catholicism. It is not easy to attend a voodoo ceremony. Friday nights at the Hotel Oloffson feature voodoo extravaganzas, but these are carefully choreographed for tourists with show-girls cavorting to a rhythmic hula-hula. One has to venture deep into the countryside to find the real thing. This I did, and found myself awoken by a rumble of drums on a tiny island near the tip of the southern peninsula. Louder and louder came the drums, accompanied by a rattling of pots and pans for rough music. The chanting of a monotonous litany rose as I approached the ceremony: little oases of familiarity - 'libera nos a malo . . . exurge morti' - were mingled with abracadabresque shrieks and howls. I followed the drumming to the tonelle, a great awning-like canopy of woven palm-thatch which serves as the roof for an improvised temple. There I insinuated myself among a crowd of spectators who had gathered on the outer edges. It was dark, although a little light was shed over the dried mud floor from an oil lamp nailed to the canopy. A few children stared at me wide-eyed and frightened behind the skirts of women. Otherwise, no one gave me a glance: most people seemed to be in a sort of trance, oblivious of intruders. Peering over a pair of shoulders, I was confronted by a scene which caused me some alarm. Twenty or so white-clad men and women staggered and reeled to the drumming as if drunk. The voodoo priest - houngan  - was wearing a red cassock with a large frilly white collar, his fingers and thumbs loaded with glittering rings and bangles. Growling like a hound, he sat astride a prostrate woman, flailing his arms and yelling 'Out] Out] Out]' It was some kind of exorcism. One woman stood still as foam collected on her lips, then threw back her head and began to gyrate her arms with rapid, scythe-like revolutions. A man slithered along the ground, muttering incomprehensible words apparently mingled with French and a little Spanish: 'Bete mechante . . . roungou . . . vougnou . . . muerte. Oh] Seigneur]' Then he leapt to his feet and began to writhe as though under the blows of an invisible whip. The drummers also looked possessed, bashing furiously at four tapering barrels with raw-hide membranes. They moved their hands with such rapidity that the noise raised the mood to fever pitch. Clothes were torn away unconsciously and two or three hot bodies collided with me, whirling away like dervishes. Soon the houngan came out of his trance, sweating and jiggering his shoulder-blades like an epileptic. When he raised a chicken to his mouth, preparatory to crunching through its neck, I moved silently out of the temple, unable to withstand the dust, the cigar smoke, the smell of crowded swaying bodies, and now this blood. Of course, Haiti is not all voodoo and cock-fight. Near the northern city of Cap-Haitien stands a fortress more massive than the Tower of London and called the Eighth Wonder of the World. The citadel was built by King Henri Christophe, who ruled the north of Haiti for 14 years until he committed suicide (with a silver bullet) in October 1820. The citadel towers above the timber-line on the crest of a mountain, and the hike uphill takes three hours. The citadel looms suddenly in a bend of the trail. A mass of titanic stone apparently welded to the landscape itself, the sheer vastness of the thing bewilders. Inside, you are shown a baffling maze of corridors and passageways, rooms honeycombed with oubliettes, tunnels and tiers of galleries. A block of stone in the topmost battlements marks the king's tomb, adorned with a tablet that states: 'Je renais de mes cendres' - I shall arise from my ashes. Henri Christophe was buried there in quicklime to preserve his corpse from the mobs. Memories of Haiti are likely to be good and bad, the intensity of experience in this country as exhilarating as it is exhausting. It has echoes of the East, undercurrents of West Africa, a little French chic and a bracing Caribbean climate. The begging is dreadful. Political violence may erupt at any moment. AIDS is everywhere. The Tonton Macoutes (secret police) are still in the woodwork. Yet there is a devil-may-care gaiety among the people, a courage and humour in the face of desperate odds which the visitor is unlikely to forget.

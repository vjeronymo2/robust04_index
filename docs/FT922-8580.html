			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / International Company News: Wal-Mart pleases with 26% advance WAL-MART Stores, the largest US retailer in sales terms, yesterday pleased investors with news of a 26 per cent increase in first-quarter profits, to Dollars 387m after tax. Sales were up by a similar amount, at Dollars 11.7bn, in the three months to the end of April, helped in part by Wal-Mart's aggressive new stores programme. During the first quarter alone, it opened 15 new stores; expanded and relocated another 38; and added seven outlets to its Sam's Clubs chain of deep-discount wholesale stores. The net addition of retail space during the first quarter totalled 3.89m sq ft. The expansion has taken the Wal-Mart chain of discount stores to 1,735 outlets, with a further 215 Sam's Clubs. A year ago, the figures were 1,591 and 178 respectively. At the earnings-per-share level, Wal-Mart made 34 cents in the first quarter, compared with 27 cents a year earlier. Its shares gained Dollars 1 to Dollars 53 on the news yesterday. Mr David Glass, chief executive of the aggressive Arkansas-based group, said the figures reflected 'excellent cost control and sales that consistently ran ahead of our plans'. He suggested the company was 'well-positioned' to meet its sales and earnings objectives for the rest of the year.</p>

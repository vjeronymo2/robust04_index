			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Survey of Switzerland (9): Military debate intensifies - The forthcoming 'Fortress Switzerland' referendum THE item of Swiss military hardware best known throughout the world is the Swiss Army knife. In Switzerland itself, the piece of hardware pre-occupying minds is the US McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 fighter aircraft. The knife, turned into a consumer item after it became popular with Allied troops serving along the Swiss border during the Second World War, may evoke images of benign Alpine soldiers whittling wood or popping corks around camp fires, but in reality the country at the centre of western Europe is one of the most militarised in the world, in pursuit of its policy of heavily-armed neutrality. However, this cornerstone of the Swiss confederation is now under increasing threat as the younger generations question the country's military doctrine in the post-Cold War world. Swiss voters go to the polls next month in a referendum to challenge again the idea of 'Fortress Switzerland.' A combination of the end of the Soviet threat and continuing economic recession helped gather enough popular support in a nationwide petition last year for the holding of a vote on June 6 to block a SFr3.5bn (Pounds 1.6bn) government deal to buy 34 F/A-18 aircraft. Government proposals for a restructuring of the citizens' militia in 1995 have not been enough to silence critics of high military spending at a time of greatly reduced threat. While Switzerland's security has depended for decades on its ability to mobilise its militia army of 625,000 men, a group of Social Democrats and pacifists claimed to have mobilised more than 500,000 people - 11 per cent of the electorate - in just 34 days to sign the petition calling for a moratorium on buying the fighter aircraft. In the event, only 100,000 signatures needed to be verified for the referendum to go ahead. Under Switzerland's system of direct democracy, any private citizen can challenge government policy by gathering the support of 100,000 voters for what is termed a 'people's initiative'. Next month's ballot will also decide on a side issue, with the pacifist lobby seeking a limit of 40 on the number of army bases in the country. What has alarmed the defence ministry in Bern is not only the scale of the opposition to the purchase of the F/A-18, but the fact that the wording of the referendum - which is decided by the successful petitioners - bans all new fighter aircraft purchases, from whatever source, until the year 2000. By that time the Swiss air force would be virtually obsolete. The country's most modern frontline fighters comprise 130 US F-5s, built in the 1970s, backed up by 45 French-built Mirage-IIIs from the 1960s. It also has 130 vintage Hawker Hunters, now 40 years old. A large 'yes' vote, even falling short of a majority, will confirm a growing dissatisfaction among the young with the idea of military service and defence at any cost. A referendum in November 1989, calling for the armed forces to be scrapped altogether, was defeated. However, 36 per cent of the electorate voted in favour. In addition to widespread pacifist sentiments, there is also a growing perception that the military establishment wields more political clout than is healthy in a democracy such as Switzerland's. THE defence ministry has attempted to counter the arguments against the F/A-18 by pointing to the fact that the costs have been spread over seven years and payments made and falling due have been allowed for in military spending plans up to 1994. Defence spending for 1993 will be SFr5.8bn, or 1.5 per cent of GDP, which represents a 6 per cent reduction on last year. A defence ministry spokesman said that opponents of the F/A-18 have ignored the fact that the deal includes privileged access to the US market for Swiss goods up to a value of SFr2.5bn. A similar agreement was signed with Germany when Switzerland bought its Leopard battle tanks. On the timing of the aircraft purchase during recession, the defence ministry pointed out that as evaluations of an aircraft take up to five years such a deal cannot be based on short-term economic considerations. 'Every country in Europe, except Austria and Switzerland, has updated its fighter force for the 21st century. It is a purchase for the long term. We would expect to have the F/A-18s in service for 30 years.' The defence ministry spokesman added that the aircraft, which is armed with Sidewinder heat-seeking missiles, was the best of its generation for Switzerland's needs and was easily integrated with European forces during the Gulf war. A cheaper alternative for air defence - ground-to-air missiles such as the US Patriot system - is not considered capable of protecting all of the country's air space, because of the limitations of radar guidance in mountainous terrain. None of these arguments impress the sponsors of the referendum, gathered under 'The Group For Switzerland Without An Army.' Their leader is Mr Andreas Gross, a bearded 41-year-old Social Democrat MP from Zurich. His party, a member of the ruling four-party coalition, voted against the deal when it was approved by parliament a year ago. 'It is a political obscenity at a time of more pressing needs and reduced world tension,' said Mr Gross, who wants the funds redirected into improved social provisions, low-cost housing and increased aid for the Third World. He believes a yes result would represent 'a blow against the political hegemony of the army.' It has 'always received special treatment and has taken a political stand in many aspects of domestic affairs, including such issues as the length of the working week. If we receive a yes vote, the government has a moral duty to remove the funds from the military budget and spend them elsewhere,' he says. Even if Mr Gross and his supporters won a majority of the popular vote - which is increasingly unlikely - they could still lose. The country's political system is weighted in favour of the cantons. A majority of the 23 individual cantons also would have to vote in favour for a moratorium on the deal to be brought into effect. Some analysts believe the yes vote would need to be as high as 60 per cent of the popular vote to secure the majority of the cantons. Support for the initiative may also have suffered because of the worsening of the conflict in Bosnia compared with a year ago when the petition was presented. In the meantime, the government continues with its defence review to be implemented in 1995. The size of the citizens' militia is to be reduced from 625,000 to 400,000 by cutting the age limits under which all Swiss men are required to undergo three weeks of military training a year.</p>

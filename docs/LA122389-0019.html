			<p><P> December 23, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SELLING PIECES OF BERLIN WALL  </P> <P> There must be something peculiar to our species that we have this preoccupation  with rocks. When we're growing up, we collect them. When we stop growing, we  erect them -- into walls.  </P> <P> I've touched rocks and walls in Washington, D.C. One rock was polished smooth  so that people couldn't break off a piece. It was from the moon. One wall was  nothing but broken pieces -- its black surface scratched with the names of a  few of my teen-age friends -- and 58,000 more.  </P> <P> The Berlin Wall, now there was a wall! It divided people and ideologies for  more than a quarter century. They got their money's worth when they built that  eyesore.  </P> <P> I never actually thought we'd ever see an end to the Berlin Wall, except from  Soviet Bloc tanks blasting through.  </P> <P> Instead, I bought a piece of that monument to subjugation, at a department  store, at $10 a pop, just in time for Christmas.  </P> <P> I know it's an artifact, and a piece of history, but every time I look at it I  have to smile. There's just something about the thought of free enterprise  selling the Wall for profit that smacks of poetic justice.  </P> <P> Who says God doesn't have a sense of humor? Only those who don't know him and  build walls.  </P> <P> BRAD L. SMITH  </P> <P> Redlands  </P></p>

			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / Press watchdog widens its remit The Press Complaints Commission is to abandon its controversial rule that stops investigation of most breaches of the newspaper industry's code of practice when there is no complainant. The rule has led to embarrassing inconsistencies. Some complaints by third parties have not been pursued even though, in some cases involving members of the royal family, the commission has intervened when no complaint has been made. The commission will now change its articles of association to make it much easier to adjudicate on third party complaints. The issue came to a head over commission plans to appoint Professor Robert Pinker, one of its members, as privacy commissioner. Prof Pinker will remain a member and continue to adjudicate on general complaints, but he will also head any investigations into unnecessary invasions of privacy. He will also have the right to start his own inquiries. His work will be done under commission auspices, and he will submit his recommendation to the full commission. In extreme cases of breaches of the rules on privacy, the privacy commissioner will be able to recommend that publishers take disciplinary action against the editors responsible. The move is the response of the newspaper industry to complaints from Mr Peter Brooke, the national heritage secretary. Following the Daily Mirror's publication of unauthorised pictures of the Princess of Wales exercising in a gym, Mr Brooke said stronger measures were needed to protect privacy although he accepted that the self-regulatory body had performed well in dealing with press inaccuracies. Mr Brooke said at the time that the government would 'take into account the failure that has occurred' over the Mirror affair when examining the scope for criminal or civil remedies to protect personal privacy.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105>Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Slovak  Republic today issued a statement on the criminal attack on the  Sarajevo market. In its statement, the ministry strongly  denounces such deliberate attacks, whichever of the fighting  sides is their originator.    At the same time, the Foreign Ministry appeals to the UN  secretary general and the UN Security Council to adopt more  radical measures to speed up the solution to the situation on  the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina, which is becoming  unbearable both politically and from the humanitarian point of  view.    The Slovak Republic will continue to assist in the search  for  a peaceful solution to the war conflict on the entire territory  of the former Yugoslavia in accordance with the extent of its  possibilities, says the statement issued by the Foreign Ministry.</p>

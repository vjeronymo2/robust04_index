			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report including interview with People's Party </F> Chairman Jose Maria Aznar; place and date of interview not  given: "Jose Maria Aznar: Deputy Prime Minister Serra Is  Jointly Responsible for Roldan's Appointment"]    [Text] People's Party Chairman Jose Maria Aznar emphasized  yesterday that the deterioration in the country's grave  situation has increased and that public tension has soared over  the past few days -- especially since the holding of the state  of the nation debate. Aznar stated that, as long as Felipe  Gonzalez remains in charge of the government, "instability in  Spain is guaranteed, with all the negative consequences that  that entails." The opposition leader reiterated that "Gonzalez'  only decent solution is for him to relinquish his post." In  Aznar's opinion, "it is impossible" to believe that Gonzalez,  who is responsible for the current atmosphere of political  crisis, can champion the struggle against corruption.    People's Party Chairman Jose Maria Aznar began his statement  as follows: "You all recall the state of the nation debate that  we held in the Congress of Deputies 19 April. Some 15 days have  elapsed since the debate, during which the deterioration of the  situation has increased and worsened, and the public's tension  and anxiety have grown. And the social alarm in the country at  the political situation existing in the country right now has  also increased. And you all also recall that in that debate I  offered Mr. Gonzalez a decent solution, which was that he tender  his resignation as head of government and that another member of  his party take over the office of prime minister and try to  tackle the country's situation. You also all know that that  proposal was rejected, and what has happened during this time  and the consequences of that rejection should be recalled today  -- 15 days later."    "Well, during those 15 days," Aznar continued, "Roldan, a  former Civil Guard director general, has fled, has appeared  before the news media, and has threatened the government.  Interior Minister Asuncion has had to tender his resignation as  a result of Mr. Roldan's escape, after stating that he was under  surveillance. Agriculture Minister Albero has had to resign as a  result of irregularities that also concerned him personally.  Former Bank of Spain Governor Rubio has gone to prison, and Mr.  Solchaga, the former economy minister and chairman of the  Socialist group in the Congress of Deputies, has had to tender  his resignation; Mr. Solchaga's predecessor, Mr. Boyer, also a  former economy minister, has been charged in the Ibercorp  affair, and former Interior Minister Mr. Corcuera has also had  to relinquish his political posts and his seat. I believe that  you will agree with me that this is not bad for 15 days.  Despite this, Mr. Gonzalez was asserting only yesterday that  the country's stability and governability are fully guaranteed.    ``But I believe that the truth is that as long as Mr.  Gonzalez remains in the government, instability in Spain is  guaranteed, with all the negative consequences that this  entails. I repeat that the only decent and most honorable  solution -- the only one that Mr. Gonzalez has -- is to  relinquish his post. The key to the situation and to  surmounting the situation lies precisely in Mr. Gonzalez'  resignation.    ``I also wish to point out that following the prime  minister's appearance yesterday, there could be some citizens  who think otherwise. I wish to point out that I did not appoint  Roldan, Mr. Gonzalez did; that I did not appoint Asuncion, Mr.  Gonzalez did; that I did not appoint Albero, Mr. Gonzalez did;  that I did not appoint Solchaga, Mr. Gonzalez did; that I did  not appoint Rubio, Mr. Gonzalez did; that I did not appoint  Boyer, Mr. Gonzalez did; and that I did not appoint Corcuera,  Mr. Gonzalez did. To seek to present himself to the public as  the champion of the struggle against corruption in Spain is an  absolutely incredible aim. To believe that the man responsible  for creating a political and moral atmosphere that has led us to  the extremely grave situation of political crisis that is very  gravely affecting Spain's prestige abroad and is affecting our  institutions' dignity can champion the struggle against  corruption is essentially, as I say, impossible. If I may say  so, it is as if a man burning down the woods somewhere in Spain  were to claim to be the chief fireman. But I will say more;  namely, that, in my opinion, there is no will, nor can there be  any will, to combat corruption. It should be recalled that the  Filesa affair, which was discussed in the state of the nation  debate, is alive and present, and it should be recalled  especially that the Socialist group voted against setting up a  committee of inquiry into the Filesa affair. Only yesterday,  the Socialist parliamentary group, following instructions from  its top leader, Felipe Gonzalez, prevented Deputy Prime Minister  Serra from appearing before the committee of inquiry into the  Roldan affair. It may be asked here, what is feared from Mr.  Serra's appearance? Is there something to be feared, or does  the appearance before the committee of inquiry into the Roldan  affair of one of the people jointly responsible for Mr. Roldan's  appointment show me a desire to clarify matters? I wish to  recall that Mr. Roldan's appointment was undoubtedly furthered,  when he was nominated, by the then interior minister and by the  current deputy prime minister, who was defense minister at that  time. Why is that appearance being prevented? So there is no  credibility, nor can there be, nor will the incredible claim to  champion the struggle against corruption exist.  <H5>  Without Authority </H5>   ``Mr. Gonzalez looks right now like a hostage in the Moncloa  Palace, at the mercy of events that he is unable to control and,  in my opinion, without any authority to surmount the country's  situation right now. His decision to entrench himself, his  decision to resist at whatever cost, and his well-established  aim to set his personal interests above the interests of Spanish  democracy and of Spain represent a heavy cost for our country,  from which it will take us some time to recover and that will  require an extraordinary effort by the whole of Spanish society.  Mr. Gonzalez' stance right now of entrenching himself, as I say,  in the Moncloa Palace, at the mercy of events or as the hostage  of any kind of pressure does not seem to me a stance that shows  even a little magnanimity or the minimum sense of the state to  be expected. I do not believe that Spain and the Spanish people  deserve to pay that very high price and that very high cost that  is being paid in terms of credibility and in terms of future  prospects for our country.    ``In any event, I wish to conclude by saying in this  introduction that there is an opportunity for Spanish citizens  12 June, and I hope and wish that for the good of our democracy,  whose institutions we have a duty to safeguard, preserve, and  strengthen, and especially for the sake of Spain's national  interest -- which is, at least for myself and for my party, and  for many millions of Spanish people what concerns us most --  that Spanish citizens will take the opportunity to react and  begin a new course in Spain's modern and contemporary history.  Many thanks; I am now at your disposal.''  <H5>  He "Did Not Tell Truth" </H5>   [ABC] I would like to ask you two questions. The first is  what is your political opinion of Felipe Gonzalez' constant  allusions to social alarm, which is the refrain that we have  been hearing from Socialist spokesmen for days? What do you  understand by social alarm? The second is whether you believe  that the stance of [Catalan president] Mr. Pujol and [Basque  Nationalist Party Chairman] Mr. Arzalluz of propping up Felipe  Gonzalez in the government in return for perquisites concerning  autonomy endangers Spain's general interests.    [Aznar] Let us take it step-by-step. In the first place, I  would have liked to be in the Congress of Deputies yesterday. I  believe that there should have been a debate in the Congress.  That was what the People's Party demanded. I say this because  it seems to me a sound rule in any democracy to appear in  parliament when you hold responsibility for the prime  ministership. To state that you are appearing before the news  media because there is a situation of social alarm, at the same  time as stating that you are not appearing in the Congress of  Deputies because that appearance would create social alarm, is  really odd from the democratic viewpoint. I would have liked  that debate to have been held in the Congress of Deputies.    I say this in order to add that yesterday Mr. Gonzalez did  not tell the truth, lied when he said that the People's Party  opposed his appearance. It has not opposed Mr. Gonzalez'  appearance next Wednesday [11 May]; what we wanted was for him  to appear yesterday, since we democratically believed that it is  his responsibility. Mr. Gonzalez has gravely jeopardized  Spain's prestige abroad and the democratic institutions' very  dignity. It is that essential responsibility for creating that  atmosphere of debasement and deterioration that must be  substantiated right now, and in our opinion, it is to be  substantiated by Mr. Gonzalez' relinquishment of the prime  ministership. I believe that Gonzalez is not clearly in control  of his situation and that he is a hostage to any kind of  pressure that he may suffer, whether it be statements by  fugitives such as Roldan or any other action that could take  place within Spain in political terms.    Second, you ask me about some nationalist parties' stance. I  have the impression that there is an increasing number of  nationalist voters in Catalonia or the Basque Country -- mainly  voters for Convergence and Union (CiU), which is maintaining the  situation -- who are wondering why that stance is being  maintained, why the support for the current government is being  maintained in such a really debased and grave situation. I feel  very close to those voters who can find no justification for  maintaining that stance, who can find no justification for the  presumed call for governability and stability resulting in the  history of Spain over the past 15 days that I have given you.    [ABC] Since it has been confirmed that the nationalists  are continuing to support Mr. Gonzalez for the present, do you  not believe that the time has come to set aside any other kind  of interests and submit a censure motion now, even if it is lost?    [Aznar] Mr. Pujol, Mr. Arzalluz, and [United Left  Coordinator General] Mr. Anguita have explicitly stated that  they are not prepared to support a censure motion. I am not  here in order to make any empty gestures or to have a good time.  I am here to help resolve Spanish citizens' problems, and a  censure motion that will not be supported would solve no problem  but could give many of them, who wish to change the situation, a  feeling of frustration. The country is no mood for pointless  exercises. It is clearly in favor of accepting responsibilities  and of taking decisions that will guarantee that we regain  international prestige, that our economy does not suffer, as it  has been suffering alarmingly over the past few days, from Mr.  Gonzalez' staying in the government, and, of course, that the  institutions and their strength are able to offer a reasonable  solution to the current crisis. And a censure motion will not  give this right now. If you ask me whether I rule it out, I  will say "no," but my duty is to seek solutions to the country's  situation.    [ABC] The prime minister stated yesterday that he does not  rule out a confidence motion. He also made an allusion to  yourself, to the effect that there is no longer the harmony of  some months ago. It is certainly apparent from your words that  there is reciprocity. Could there be a rapprochement between  the two of you again?  <H5>  Confidence Motion </H5>   [Aznar] On the submitting of a confidence motion, it is a  responsibility that rests with the government. In Spain's  recent history, there was one in 1990. So it is the government  that must assess whether or not a confidence motion will be  submitted. Taking up again a previous reply, I have the  impression that if the government's greatest source of support  is not interested in a confidence motion, the government will  not have much interest in it, either. So I do not expect much  from that, or rather, anything. I emphasize again that the only  decent and honorable solution right now would be for Gonzalez to  tender his resignation. What I do wish to say is that what was  stated by Mr. Gonzalez yesterday is clear frivolity, because to  say that confidence motions are submitted when there is no  confidence is a sign that it is not true. That is  constitutionally inaccurate and politically dull. Confidence  motions are submitted in order to secure a parliamentary  relegitimization. Now if Mr. Gonzalez believes that he does not  need parliamentary relegitimization because he has a  relegitimization by telephone, then I emphasize again that these  are odd methods of democratic understanding. But, I repeat, it  is not for me to make that decision. It is for the government  and Mr. Gonzalez. The second question was about channels of  communication. I will tell you quite frankly that there are  always channels of communication. There is a permanent formal  channel of communication that is parliament, and there are  others that, if they serve for having relegitimizations by  telephone, serve for establishing channels of communication.  Mr. Gonzalez' channel of communication with me is as simple as  picking up the telephone and phoning. And whenever he has done  so, he has obtained a positive response. I will tell you more;  I will tell you a short story, and, generous, they tell lies  like the rest of us breathe. [sentence as published] You know  that I recently visited Morocco. I discussed that visit with  Gonzalez on several occasions. One my return, one of the phone  calls that I made was to Mr. Gonzalez: I have had these  political talks; when you deem it opportune, I am at your  disposal to give you my impressions and the contents of those  talks. I am still waiting. Channel of communication?    [ABC] You have spoken of channels of communication with the  government and of institutions that we must safeguard. Is it  possible that that channel of communication that is as simple as  picking up the telephone will make it possible for the the talks  on the famous democratic impetus to be resumed and for there to  be agreement on the ombudsman and other institutions?    [Aznar] With respect to the first question, I will say that  I do not know. All that I do know is that right now, if the  People's Party had accepted the formula proposed by the  government for parliamentary committees of inquiry, there would  have been no committee of inquiry into the Roldan affair, just  as there is no appearance by Deputy Prime Minister Mr. Serra,  just as there is no committee of inquiry into the Filesa affair,  just as after two years in the Ibercorp affair, we find that  there could also be a large majority of Spanish people who are  cheerfully prepared to accept that the jailings of some people  over the past few days is a coincidence. They coincided one day  exactly before Gonzalez' appearance at a news conference. By  chance. I can tell you that the People's Party's intention  right now, however many the difficulties may be, remains the  same one with which we began those talks, which are something  that concerns us right now, bearing in mind the objective harm  that Mr. Gonzalez' staying in the government is doing to our  country's political and institutional credibility. To transform  a personal leadership crisis into a national political crisis is  an extremely grave responsibility. And to cling to power,  rejecting any solution, seems to me another extremely grave  responsibility that should be clearly taken up again. And I  hope that it will be taken up again.    Second, the matter of the political responsibilities. I  said in the state of the nation debate that we are acting very  vigorously, from calling for committees of inquiry to demanding  certain people's dismissal or resignation. And here it is not  so much a matter of the responsibility for the appointment of  one or two people. It is a matter of the general state of  debasement of Spanish life. It is a matter of the  responsibility for creating the most politically and morally  debased atmosphere that Spain has had in many years. That is  the responsibility that Mr. Gonzalez cannot evade. I have said  it before. The man who is responsible for sheltering and  tolerating that atmosphere of corruption cannot champion the  struggle against corruption, and his staying on is a mistake.    [ABC] I would like to know why the People's Party believes  that having a Socialist other than Gonzalez as prime minister  would provide greater stability or resolve the crisis. I would  also like to know whose hostage Felipe Gonzalez is in the  Moncloa Palace and whether you have spoken recently with the  Generalitat president or with the Basque Nationalist Party  chairman.    [Aznar] I have spoken with neither this week. To demand the  prime minister's resignation, especially because of his  responsibility for creating this atmosphere of political and  institutional corruption, is not exactly something pleasant.  The only thing for which you can hope is that there will be  sufficient magnanimity to be able to set Spanish democracy and  Spain's interests above personal interests. Of course, we all  agree that Mr. Gonzalez is not attached to his post -- we are  convinced of that -- but since he is not attached to his post,  he should show it a little.    And if Mr. Gonzalez has a doubt, it is quite simple; he can  call an election when he pleases. Not now, because it is not  legally possible, but as soon as it is legally possible, he can  call it, and he will see how the public interprets his spurious  appeals in these matters.  <H5>  Offer of Change </H5>   [ABC] Do you not believe that you are in danger of becoming  ineffective through repeating so often the demand for Gonzalez'  resignation? Are you not also in danger of giving the  impression that that the only thing that is being done is to  wait for the PSOE [Spanish Socialist Workers Party] to die of  sheer scandal?    [Aznar] My problem is to offer the public a solution. What  is the best right now? The best is Mr. Gonzalez' resignation.  I would greatly like to change Spain's situation tomorrow, but  I wish to point out that 10 months ago there was an election in  which the PSOE won the majority, and I also wish to point out  that those who could support a censure motion do not wish to do  so. The solutions to the country's situation are those that we  offer. If Gonzalez says: "I will not resign, and there will be  no confidence motion and no election," that is his affair, but I  do not believe that that is to give the country a solution.    [ABC] What is your interpretation of Congress Speaker Felix  Pons' analysis, in which he asserts that the easiest solution  for you is to demand the prime minister's resignation and thus  lay bare the Socialist election poster?    [Aznar] I ask you to hold me responsible for what I am --  not what I am not. Pujol -- not I -- makes his decisions, and  Mr. Arzalluz makes his decisions. I tackle this situation in  the way that I deem most advisable for the country.</p>

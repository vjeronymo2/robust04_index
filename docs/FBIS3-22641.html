The U.S. television  network CNN today said that an official of the British Lyon  Corporation, which specializes in the production of sweets and  chocolates, has revealed that U.S. counterparts used banned  chemical products in the production of sweets that were  specially prepared for the U.S. troops taking part in the Gulf  war.    CNN quoted Edward Harrison as saying that if it were not for  the chemical products used in the production of sweets, the  sweets corporations would not have been able to cope with the  problem presented by chocolate melting under the extremely high  temperature in Saudi Arabia, where the U.S. troops were deployed.    It is to be recalled that U.S. troops complained that the  sweets they received at the time were not in good shape. This  prompted the U.S. military command to ask U.S. sweets  corporations to find a rapid solution to this problem.    An official source in Baghdad commented on this news report,  saying that the U.S. Department of Defense is making various  attempts and promoting various lies to obliterate the facts  pertaining to the mysterious disease that has plagued U.S. and  British troops. Independent U.S. scientific quarters, he added,  have said that the cause of this disease is the handling of  shells coated with depleted uranium, which produces radioactive  reactions inside vehicles, aircraft, and tanks, thus affecting  the health of troops, not to mention the impact the on  environment.</p>

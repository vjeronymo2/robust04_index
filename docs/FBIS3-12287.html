He stressed this odious crime will not  go unpunished.    'Abbas Zaki told AL-DUSTUR this massacre is within the  framework of the Israeli scheme to use terror operations similar  to those committed in Dayr Yasin to empty Hebron of its  inhabitants. He added: Not content with its crime in Hebron,  the enemy tried to commit another massacre during prayer in a  mosque in Sa'ir at noon yesterday.    'Abbas Zaki said: From this premise, we insist on removing  these settlers and setting a timetable for dismantling the  settlements. He said: The slogan should be the West Bank and  Gaza first and not Gaza-Jericho first, and international  legitimacy resolutions should be implemented. [passage omitted]</p>

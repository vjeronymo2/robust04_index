			<p><P> April 8, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ROCK ROWDINESS  </P> <P> Regarding the April 1 Pop Eye report on filming security guards at rock  concerts, I applaud Mission U.K.'s creative approach to combating bouncer  thuggery.  </P> <P> While attending a 1988 Midnight Oil concert at the Santa Barbara County Bowl, I  witnessed aggressive bouncers repeatedly rough up, hit and generally abuse fans  whose chief crime, jumping onstage, should demand at most a polite ejection  from the venue -- not a broken nose or arm.  </P> <P> I sincerely hope that we do not have to relive the lesson of Altamont over and  over again.  </P> <P> BRUCE MURRAY  </P> <P> Rolling Hills  </P></p>

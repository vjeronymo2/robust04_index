			<p>941229 FT  29 DEC 94 / Wales and west face further floods Parts of England and Wales face severe flooding with weather forecasters warning of more torrential rain and gales this week. The National Rivers Authority said yesterday several big rivers were close to bursting their banks after heavy rain over the Christmas holiday. In England, the south-west and the west Midlands were the worst affected, with the authority issuing more than 25 flood warnings. Train journeys were disrupted and holidaymakers returning to work experienced long delays. Police issued warnings to motorists in the south of England. The London Weather Centre last night forecast gales gusting up to 70 mph accompanied by heavy rain. In Wales the situation showed signs of easing last night. The NRA said: 'It looks now as if the worst of the rainfall has passed. If the situation stays like that we should begin to see water levels falling.' However, many rivers, including the Wye, were still on 'red' alert. Around Dartmoor and Exmoor recently completed defensive schemes averted much of the flood danger.</p>

			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / Governor stands firm on naming HK cabinet LORD Wilson, the governor of Hong Kong, yesterday, hit out at China's attempt to influence the composition of the colony's cabinet, saying appointments were the prerogative of the governor. Lord Wilson said that between now and 1997, when the colony reverts to Chinese sovereignty, appointments would be made in Hong Kong by the governor after consultation with the foreign secretary in London. On Thursday a senior Chinese official said in Beijing that it would be unacceptable to China if members of the United Democrats, a key political party in the colony, were appointed to the cabinet, or executive council. The Democrats won most of the popularly contested seats in last September's elections. If the colony's incoming governor, Mr Chris Patten, decides to reshape the membership of the cabinet some members of the Democrats are likely to be offered seats. The Chinese intervention was seen in Hong Kong as an attempt to set the agenda for Mr Patten before he arrives on July 9. Mr Yeung Sum, deputy leader of the Democrats, said yesterday China's intervention in domestic Hong Kong politics was unwarranted. China could not lay down preconditions for membership of the council, he said.</p>

As is known, the work of this commission is  headed by reform minister Liia Hanni, others attending  were  ministers Jaan Leetsaar, Kaido Kama and Andres Tarand.    Those gathered listened to information about how land reform  and ownership reform are coming along in the Vorumaa  district. An overview was given by Tiit Soosaar, the new  district elder of Vorumaa and Tiiu Joe, head of the  Vorumaa Land Office. There are more than 200 registered  pieces of real estate in the Vorumaa district, making it  one  of the three leading districts in the republic. One could say  that property returns in Vrumaa have been carried out  successfully even though, by now, progress is coming to a halt,  as it has everywhere else. People are no longer in a hurry to  become landowners, because there is no profit in cultivating  land, they are interested more in getting the land back or  getting compensated for it. Not having a land assessment law,  however, has brought all of this to a standstill.    Jaan Leetsaar, minister of agriculture, told this reporter  later, by way of a comment, that he is very much concerned about  the situation faced at the time of spring plowing. There is no  sense of security neither for those owning the land, nor for  those currently using it. The minister thought that it was high  time for the parish governments to assemble legally entitled  owners and current users of land around a negotiating table and  reach a peaceful agreement about land management.    The bill of the cadastral law was also discussed by the  commission. A review of it was presented by Valter Aasmae,  one of the principal authors of the bill. Next week, all members  of the government commission will give their opinions on the  bill, whereupon it will be introduced to the ministries. Land  Office advisor Toomas Kutti thought that the cadastral law could  be passed by Riigikogu [Estonia's parliament] in a  month-and-a-half, at the earliest.    The commission also talked about the bill for land  assessment  law, now in its second reading in Riigikogu. No changes were  deemed necessary in that bill.    At virtually all of the sessions of the government's land  reform commission, there has been talk about people who are to  carry out land and ownership reform--pointing out that there are  not enough of them and those who are available do not have the  necessary training. The agricultural school at Kehtna has been  preparing people for this job and it also has a special  curriculum for it. However, it is high time that both the  agricultural and technical universities start training a new  crop of reformers.    The commission was also seeking ways to simplify the  procedures for turning land and structures over to municipal  ownership.</p>

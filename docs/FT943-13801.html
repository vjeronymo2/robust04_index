			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / Observer: Frosty logic A new iciness prevails between Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank, Germany's two largest credit institutions. Oddly enough, the chill is attributable to a heating equipment company called Buderus, sold off by the ailing Metallgesellschaft group last month. The two banks co-operated to place shares in Buderus - raising DM1.2bn of much-needed cash for MG - but Dresdner subsequently played its own wily game. Dresdner has now popped up as a 10 per cent shareholder - on its own account  -in Buderus. It's also helped Bilfinger &amp; Berger - one of Germany's biggest construction companies - buy a further 15 per cent. The Bilfinger move is being interpreted as a possible prelude to a full-scale takeover. In any case, the action seems to have taken both Buderus and Deutsche Bank by surprise. Deutsche's protestations that the placing guaranteed Buderus' independence now look, well, somewhat ill-informed. An added piquancy is that secret accumulation of big share stakes is shortly to become illegal: under the terms of the long-awaited Financial Markets Promotion Act, due to be enacted on August 1, companies will have to disclose stakes when they reach 5 per cent. Understandably, Dresdner says it's not broken the law, because the law was not yet in force. Impeccable logic. But perhaps faulty public relations?</p>

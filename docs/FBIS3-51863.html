			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari in </F> Chiapas State on 25 January -- recorded]    [Text] Compatriots in Chiapas: I have been following events  closely since the conflict in Chiapas began, and it has been the  main concern of the president of the Republic. I have always  tried to make decisions that would guarantee security for the  population. With determination, I opened the path for a peaceful  solution of the conflict.    The Mexican Army's role prevented the conflict from  extending  to other parts of Chiapas State. The Army fulfilled its  constitutional duty with loyalty and will continue protecting  the towns.    Today's main task is to seek peace by every means. You have  witnessed all the efforts made to attain peace and the results  obtained so far. Recent developments call for serious meditation  from all of us to change old procedures and methods that did not  work.    I have come to Chiapas to offer my steadfast support to the  state in promoting peace, development, and justice. The most  important factor will be a change in state relations. Projects  and assistance will be defined by the municipalities, social  organizations, and the state's congress, with political guidance  from Governor Lopez Moreno. Your plans and most urgent projects  will be supported by federal government institutions. Along with  meeting your most urgent needs, we will redouble efforts to find  in-depth solutions for the state's problems.    Our most urgent task is to work together toward  reconciliation. We know that when there are major differences,  this is not easy, and therefore, we must try again and again.  The task we have ahead of us is everyone's responsibility and  everyone must share it, including government employees, from the  most simple service to the highest responsibility. It is also a  task for the people of Chiapas and all of the communities. All  of us, with the people of Chiapas united for security, justice,  peace, and democracy, will have to establish better relations  with Indian communities by modifying priorities and accepting  their decisions. The task we have ahead will not be easy. In  facing divisions and rancor, humanitarian feelings and new  actions of justice must prevail.    To each family in Chiapas, I want to express my concern and  also my sadness over the recent incidents. At the same time, I  assure you we have been and will always be attentive to your  needs. We will do whatever we can to guarantee your safety and  promote justice, which are the bases for the tranquillity of  every family and community.    Here we are. I have just held another meeting with the  social  organizations. We will continue to center our efforts on  consolidating peace, justice, and promoting a better climate of  coexistence in Chiapas. Together, united, I am sure we can make  it. Thank you very much.</p>

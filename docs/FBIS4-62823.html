			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article under the "Viewpoint" rubric by Doctor of Economic </F> Sciences Gleriy Kuzmich Shirokov and Doctor of Historical  Sciences Andrey Gennadiyevich Volodin: "The `Eurasian Union':  Anatomy of the Problem"]    [Text] The idea of the "Eurasian Union" has generated  conflicting responses. According to the national patriots'  thinking this initiative is a reaction to the deepening crisis  in the republics of the former USSR and the result of the  realization by the new regional elites of the futility of their  chosen socioeconomic and political course. The democrats, on  the other hand, tend to believe that the projected unification  takes no account of the fact that there are several  civilizations existing in the former USSR, of different levels  of socioeconomic development, and of different types of  political consciousness and political culture. Between these  positions -- to repeat Goethe's well-known thesis -- is not the  truth but a most complex political problem.    Why has the idea of the "Eurasian Union" arisen, and how  realistic is it? It has now become clear that the centrifugal  tendencies are now giving way to centripetal ones. However, it  is important to understand the reasons for the alternation of  centrifugal and centripetal cycles in our history.    The processes of disintegration reflected the sharp decline  in the effectiveness of the archaic "Union" state organism,  whose structures (institutions) and functions had entered into  irreconcilable conflict with the development of modern  industrial society. This lack of correspondence became  grotesque when viewed against the background of the Union  leadership's inability to offer a concept (or more precisely a  strategy) of modernization which was convincing to society as a  whole and attractive to the republic elites as they sought to  find a cosy "niche" for themselves in the common "edifice" of  the Union (the proposals to conclude a new Union Treaty in the  late eighties). The formation of new regional elites, which had  infantile notions of the laws of economics and thus made the  winning of sovereignty a legitimate basis for the ascent to  power, was accelerated by the elections of 1989-1990. In  addition, beginning in 1985, the USSR's political system was in  thrall to internal destabilizing factors because the center was  taking ever-diminishing account of the "traditional" regional  elites (the unceremonious removal without adequate replacement  of such leaders as D. Kunayev, V. Shcherbitskiy, and G. Aliyev,  whatever the reasons for those actions were).    The centrifugal tendencies increased because of the  inability  of the state party (the CPSU) to perform the once-customary  functions of integrating society horizontally (the link between  various territories and ethnic groups) and vertically (the  "pyramids" of power which maintained the continuity of  administration and control of society). Then the ruling party  effectively lost the function of politically socializing  ambitious individuals -- the "informal leaders" (these functions  passed over to the opposition movements, fronts, and nascent  parties).    The idea of the "Eurasian Union" and of the restoration of  the single area is an attempt to reverse the disintegration  tendencies and change the direction of our common development.  Thus it is necessary to see clearly both the merits and the  dubious aspects of the former union state. On the one hand the  rigid federal pattern hampered processes which are natural on  such a vast territory -- the processes of decentralization and  the increasing stability of a system achieved by means of  effective components acting on their own initiative.  Regionalism and separatism encouraged the attempts of the Union  center to restrict the manifestation of cultural identity by  ethnic groups. On the other hand, the republics were drawn into  the division of labor by means of the transfer of resources from  the more developed to the less developed regions (the theme of  the "nonclassical Russian empire" in which the "colonies"  developed at the expense of the "homeland" impresses both the  democrats and the patriots). Furthermore, the interrepublic  division of labor stimulated the training of cadres on a modern  basis -- which promoted the emergence in the republics of a  contemporary economic and political elite. In present  conditions the idea of the "Eurasian Union" is an instrument for  overcoming such consequences of decentralization as the sharp  worsening of the economic and political situation,  improvisations in the socioeconomic course (attempts are often  made to compensate for its effective collapse by surrealistic  appeals to the "national idea," by accusing the Russian-speaking  population and the Russian army of aggravating economic and  ecological problems, and so forth), customs barriers which are  finally destroying the economies of the republics, the  introduction of untenable ("soft") currencies, intensified  migration, and so forth.    The implementation of the "Eurasian initiative" must  presuppose the consideration of two interconnected factors.  Number one: the realization of the need to recreate a single  area must occur naturally and spontaneously. Number two: As  soon as the significance of the "Eurasian Union" idea itself is  realized, the "Eurasian Union" may then emerge not spontaneously  but as a result of a conscious countermovement by the former  republics. The structuring of the new common area takes time,  great political skill, and tact. It should not be forgotten  that, for all the burdens and deprivations of the post-Soviet  period, the idea of an autonomous national existence still  inspires the vital forces of a certain section of the population  in the republics, because the formation of the national  consciousness is still not complete and economic interests are  often perceived and molded by an elite on the basis of  ideological values, the main one of which is the "national  idea." In addition, the restoration of the area which has been  destroyed may entail significant political and economic losses  for the new national elites, especially those brought to the  surface of political life by opposition to the Union center and  then to the "imperial policy" of Russia. It is not hard to see  that, given the level of competence that has been achieved,  these groups could be out of office in the new configuration of  forces.    The restoration of the economic ties which have been  destroyed is not as simple a task as it may seem. The  centralized system of control, management, and distribution has  ceased to exist, and a new mechanism for coordinating the  interests of the proposed association's components has not yet  been formed. It is over two years since the disintegration of  the USSR, and in that time there has been a reorientation of  foreign economic ties taking place in the republics -- within  the framework of the former Union as well as outside. (This  tendency is particularly clear in Russia, which is making  serious efforts to devise a strategy of import substitution).  Integration, let us reemphasize, takes time. (Let us recall  that in West Europe this process has been going on for over 20  years now). Integration must happen not through coercion but on  a strictly voluntary basis: The republics must independently  determine for themselves the configuration and range of the  powers of "supranational" political and administrative  structures and then delegate the necessary powers to them.    The voluntary unification of the republics of the former  Union is a model for the common area in the future. What is  needed now, however, is to prepare a "timetable" for the  negotiating process which will set down a hierarchy of  priorities, the sequence of tasks pertaining to integration, and  the period in which they are to be accomplished. What can be  done right now is to find a common approach to such tasks as the  elaboration of a concept of unification, the protection of the  CIS borders, military organization and development on a modern  basis, the introduction of common customs regulations and  tariffs, the restoration of economic ties which take into  account variations in the level to which the economies have been  reformed, the standardization of information policy, the  integration of money circulation, the fight against crime, and  the coordination of foreign policy and of the pace and general  thrust of the reforms. In other words, we are talking about a  confederative formation whose degree of integration will  gradually rise.    The idea of the "Eurasian Union" will become considerably  more attractive to the republics as the ruling elites come to  understand the character of the world system, whose laws of  development are now determined entirely by the international  competitiveness of national economic systems in the harsh  conditions of the scientific and technical revolution. Finally,  let us recall Willy Brandt's words: "History is a dynamic  process in which nothing remains unchanged."</p>

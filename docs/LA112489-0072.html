			<p><P> November 24, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> THESE TURKEYS DIDN'T STAY FOR DINNER  </P> <P> Maybe the six wild turkeys that were found missing from a Northridge yard  Thanksgiving morning knew that it was time to make themselves scarce. Or  perhaps a holiday-minded thief couldn't resist the idea of a turkey-naping on  Turkey Day.  </P> <P> Police were unsure whether the birds, valued by owner Thomas Walsh at $50  apiece, fled on their own or were the victims of fowl play. However they left,  all that remained was a trail of feathers from the man's property to a nearby  storm drain, Los Angeles Police Officer Richard Gray said.  </P> <P> "He was raising them, for what reason I don't know," Gray said. "They might  have decided to leave because they knew what fate was in store for them."  </P> <P> Walsh discovered that the birds were missing about 6 a.m. from his fenced-in  back yard in the 8400 block of Wilbur Avenue, Gray said.  </P> <P> Walsh could not be reached for comment. A neighbor who lives two houses away  said she was unaware that turkeys were being raised there.  </P> <P> "I'm aware he had some chickens and some roosters because I hear them at 5  o'clock in the morning," Leonora Sastre said. "But we never saw any turkeys."  </P></p>

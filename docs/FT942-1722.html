			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / World Trade News: Singapore Airlines in Dollars 10.3bn order Singapore Airlines (SIA) yesterday placed one of the world's biggest aircraft orders - for 52 Boeing and Airbus large wide-body airliners, worth Dollars 10.3bn (Pounds 6.68bn). The order surpasses the Dollars 8.6bn order SIA placed in 1990 and covers 22 Boeing 747-400 jumbos worth Dollars 4.9bn and 30 Airbus A340-300E long-range airliners worth Dollars 5.4bn. Both the US manufacturer and its European rival competed fiercely for the SIA order in view of the reluctance of airlines to commit themselves to significant new aircraft purchases. Earlier this year SIA told the bidders it planned to buy a combination of Boeing and Airbus wide-body airliners, but it also suggested it would consider opting for just one aircraft type if it got a sufficiently attractive proposal, further intensifying the competition. However, SIA finally opted for a mix of 399-seat Boeing 747s and 271-seat A340s, which it will deploy on long-haul routes that do not require the capacity of a 747. All three leading engine manufacturers, Pratt &amp; Whitney and General Electric of the US and Rolls-Royce of the UK, were competing to supply power equipment for the new SIA aircraft. SIA selected Pratt &amp; Whitney engines for its new 747s and CFM engines jointly developed by GE and Snecma of France for the A340s. Although Rolls-Royce was regarded as an outsider in the SIA competition, the decision is a disappointment for the UK aero-engine manufacturer. Of the 22 Boeing 747 airliners, 11 are on firm order and the rest on option. Of the 30 A340s 10 are on firm order and 20 on option. The total value of the firm orders placed by SIA is Dollars 4.25bn. SIA said it had the flexibility to convert the options to other aircraft types. The Boeing 747-400s can be converted to any of the three models of the new Boeing 777 twin-engine wide-body aircraft, while the A340-300E options can be converted to the twin-engine A330 or another version of the A340. SIA, one of the world's most profitable airlines, expects to finance the orders from its cash flow, but if necessary it will resort to borrowing or leasing. The new aircraft, to be delivered from 1996 to 2003, will expand SIA's fleet as well as replace older aircraft. SIA at present operates 63 aircraft and expects to see its fleet grow to 111 aircraft by 2003. 'The latest order is an expression of our faith in the long-term health of the aviation industry and the promising future of SIA,' said Dr Cheong Choong Kong, the airline's managing director.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, 26 Jan (TANJUG) -- "The French initiative  is rather vague to us. We cannot tell whether it calls for the  political or military presence of the United States," Srpska  republic president Radovan Karadzic told Serb Television,  Sarajevo Studio, this evening.    "We are in no way opposed to a more active U.S. and Russian  involvement in the political resolution of the crisis," Karadzic  added.    Speaking about the Russian initiative, Karadzic assessed  that  it conforms with what has been envisaged -- that such a document  should be made public after agreement is reached between the  three [Bosnian] sides. "I believe that it is good to insist on  this conference under the auspices of the European Union and we  are not against the possible engagement of the UN Security  Council, the United States, and Russia," Karadzic said.    "However, it seems to me that the international community  should find ways to force the Muslim leadership into accepting  peace because it is obviously a problem for them to accept  anything. This current Muslim political team cannot bring the  war to an end because it is incapable of leading its own people  to peace and giving it a state of its own. They are leading the  Muslim people to their doom," Karadzic stressed.    Commenting on U.S. President Clinton's statement that nobody  should be forced to accept solutions unacceptable to them, the  Srpska republic president said he welcomes such a stance  because, in his view, outside pressure cannot effect a solution  in Bosnia.    "What we are insisting on is that the United States and part  of the international community begin treating all three sides in  the conflict equally, which means that the sanctions should be  lifted immediately. I must say that the Muslims have,  unfortunately, opted for war, and our people must now close  ranks even more and prepare to defend our state. This will  require great efforts on our part, but the Muslim leadership  must be aware that we will be well prepared for war if it does  break out," Karadzic underlined.    Alija Izetbegovic's refusal to accept the Russian initiative  was assessed by Karadzic as yet another move aimed at  undermining everything that leads to peace.    "The Muslim leaders' deranged hopes that they will conquer  all of Bosnia-Herzegovina represent a disaster for the Muslim  people. They could not defeat us even when they were allied  with the Croats. We and the Croats have opted for peace -- a  position that leaves the Muslim military option without a ghost  of a chance," Radovan Karadzic said.</p>

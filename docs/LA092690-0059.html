			<p><P> September 26, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OXNARD;  </P> <P> COUNCIL APPROVES FIRE SPRINKLER LAW  </P> <P> The Oxnard City Council unanimously adopted an ordinance on Tuesday that will  require installation of automatic fire sprinklers in every new building and in  every building undergoing major modifications.  </P> <P> The ordinance, proposed by Fire Chief Richard Smith, affects commercial and  residential buildings.  </P> <P> A major modification is defined as an addition or alteration that exceeds 60%  of the structure's replacement cost.  </P> <P> Similar ordinances have been adopted in 37 other cities in California,  including Napa, Anaheim, Burbank, Glendale and San Luis Obispo.  </P> <P> The ordinance has already won the support of the Oxnard Chamber of Commerce.  </P> <P> Under the old law, automatic sprinklers were required only in structures larger  than 5,000 square feet or taller than 35 feet.  </P> <P> In a report to the council, Smith said automatic fire sprinklers are the most  efficient fire protection available. Considering the department's tight budget,  he said, sprinklers are preferable to hiring more firefighters and building  more fire stations.  </P> <P> In addition, he said, insurance rates for homes and businesses that install  sprinklers are usually reduced 10% to 30%.  </P> <P> "They are, without question, the most efficient and cost-effective  fire-protection system ever designed," he said. "Only sprinklers actually  extinguish the fire where it starts." HUGO MARTIN  </P></p>

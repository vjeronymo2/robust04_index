			<p><P> November 14, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ONLY IN L.A. PEOPLE AND EVENTS  </P> <P> It's the kind of off-screen situation you might expect in Hollywood:  </P> <P> A performer has the female lead in a television series although he is actually  a male. And he virtually refuses to perform on camera or cooperate at publicity  sessions unless his young mistress is sitting nearby.  </P> <P> His agent even brought along the mistress to the Headliners Awards banquet  staged over the weekend by the Los Angeles Press Club at the Biltmore Hotel.  She sat at a separate table while the actor received an award.  </P> <P> "He loses interest in things if he doesn't see her sitting there," explained  one of the people in his entourage.  </P> <P> The mistress goes by the flashy name of Falcon.  </P> <P> The actor, we're sorry to say, boys and girls, is . . . Lassie.  </P> <P> Barbara Adams writes, "While I was moving at a snail's pace from Mandeville  Canyon due to the slide on Pacific Coast Highway, I was following a Mercedes  with a license plate that read:  </P> <P> "'PCH CLSD."'  </P> <P> Incidentally, if you're a member of the These-Things-Happen-in-Threes cult, you  no doubt took comfort from the fact that, following the landslide that shut  down PCH and the shipwreck that closed Culver Boulevard, a small plane landed  on the Golden State Freeway Sunday.  </P> <P> Customers with coupons for one Long Beach car wash should read the small print,  especially if the grime on their car could be carbon-dated.  </P> <P> Now that East Germany's leaders have stopped using the Berlin Wall as a  restraining device, an Encino capitalist wants to buy it. But it may not be for  sale.  </P> <P> "I phoned the embassy today (Monday) and they said they'd probably want to keep  it," said Barry Stuppler, a rare coin dealer who has offered to give East  Germany $50 million for the 28-mile-long concrete wall.  </P> <P> "They pointed out that the Chinese have used their wall for a tourist  attraction and said they (East Germany) might do the same."  </P> <P> Stuppler's plan is to open a factory in East Germany that would break the wall  into several million 3-inch pieces that would be sealed in plastic and sold --  accompanied by certificates of authenticity -- for up to $100 each.  </P> <P> "We would hire East Berliners to produce them, and they would find out what  entrepreneurship is all about," Stuppler said.  </P> <P> He said the merchandising idea occurred to him after he saw TV pictures of  joyful West Berliners chipping away at the wall with hammers after East Germany  announced an end to travel restrictions for its citizens.  </P> <P> Stuppler said that since making his offer, he has heard from several people who  would like to invest in his scheme as well as people who have tried to interest  him in others.  </P> <P> For example, he said, "One had an idea for a scented ball for garbage  disposals."  </P> <P> The telephone system at Banning High in Wilmington is in danger of flunking  out.  </P> <P> Faculty members recently received this bulletin:  </P> <P> "Due to the phone problems if you get any calls, remember to get the person's  name and phone number right away before you get cut off!!!"  </P></p>

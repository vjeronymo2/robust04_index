			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / Synergen hit by failure of its main drug Synergen, once a star of the US biotechnology industry, has stopped researching Antril, its biggest product, and announced a restructuring which could lead to the company's sale. More than half of the group's 630 employees will lose their jobs as Synergen reverts to a business with no products in the pipeline for the medium term. The company, based in Boulder, Colorado, had built a manufacturing plant for Antril. This will be closed and put up for sale. Selling the entire company was also a possibility, said Mr Greg Abbott, chief executive. Synergen shares fell yesterday by Dollars 4 to Dollars 4 7/8 . They were at a peak of Dollars 66 1/4 in December 1992. Antril, the company's main drug, was intended as a treatment for the complex and dangerous condition called sepsis. It is the lastest in a series of potential treatments to have failed and casts doubts on whether the condition can be successfully treated by any single drug. Other companies researching similar sepsis treatments include UK biotechnology companies Celltech and British Biotechnology, Wellcome of the UK and Japan's Fujisawa. Mr James Noble, finance director of British Biotechnology, conceded yesterday that no one drug would ever be able to cure all sepsis patients. Earlier this year, Californian biotechnology company Chiron abandoned its sepsis research programme. Other failures in recent years include Centocor and Xoma, whose share prices collapsed when, like Synergen, they abandoned research in Phase III development, the last and most expensive of the phases of clinical trials.

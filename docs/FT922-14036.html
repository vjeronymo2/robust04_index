			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / UK Company News: Dagenham Motors Dagenham Motors, the London and south-east-based motor dealer, saw pre-tax profits fall by 38 per cent, from Pounds 3.41m to Pounds 2.11m, in the year to December 31. Turnover rose some Pounds 2m to Pounds 127.2m. Mr David Philip, chairman, said that contrary to many forecasts, 1991 saw yet another decline in both car and commercial vehicle markets. The group had, however, taken advantage of opportunities presented by the recession and acquired two dealerships towards the year-end. An unchanged final dividend of 4p is proposed to maintain the total at 5.75p.</p>

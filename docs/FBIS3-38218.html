			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Austrian Chancellor Franz Vranitzky and a </F> report on an interview with German Deputy Foreign Minister  Helmut Schaefer by correspondent Marianna Polikhroniadhou; place  and date not given--ellipses as published]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Polikhroniadhou] Following  your talks with the Greek side, would you say there has been  progress on the timeframe for concluding negotiations on  Austria's accession to the European Union [EU]?    [Vranitzky] We believe the date will still be early March.  Although this goal is considered to be optimistic, we believe it  can be achieved. After the talks in Athens in particular, we  have set out the prospects for concluding the accession  negotiations within the timeframe scheduled originally.    [Polikhroniadhou] Are you optimistic about the outcome of  the  referendum on accession that will be held in your country?    [Vranitzky] Yes, I believe the outcome will be positive. But  we must conclude the negotiations first. The next step is the  referendum. Of course, some people in Austria say that perhaps  the referendum should have been held first. But when someone  wants to conquer a 2,000-meter mountain, he is first interested  in conquering the first 400 meters and then the rest.    [Polikhroniadhou] Do you believe that during the Greek  presidency, our country can play a more substantive role for  stability in the former Yugoslavia?    [Vranitzky] I hope so, because Greece is the EU country with  the best knowledge and experience of the Balkans, and if war  spreads, it will be the one at the greatest risk of getting  immediately involved. This is why we must seriously consider  the Greek presidency's positions on resolving the crisis in the  region. But no one can be so optimistic that they believe the  problem could be solved during the short Greek presidency. What  frequently happens when we discuss a Bosnian solution is that  many sides suggest various solutions that cancel each other out.  <H5>  Relations </H5>   [Polikhroniadhou] After meeting Prime Minister Andreas  Papandreou and based on your statement afterward, you have  created the impression that you share the Greek concerns about  the former Republic of Macedonia....    [Vranitzky] Papandreou presented the issue of the former  Republic of Macedonia calmly and explained well enough the Greek  position about the state being recognized under the current  conditions. On this issue, the possible dangers may be weighed  up. One reason for these dangers could be that the country's  population consists of a variety of people (Serbs, Albanians,  etc.), which means it would be easy to receive outside  influence. We understand the Greek positions, which stem from  your country's history and your geographical position.    Austria decided to recognize this state within the UN  framework but did not decide to establish bilateral diplomatic  relations with it. But I am optimistic that with the expanding  European Union and the finding of a mutually acceptable solution  on accession within the European framework, this issue will be  resolved soon.    [Polikhroniadhou] Political Spring Chairman Andonios Samaras  asked the government not to rule out the possibility of our  country exercising its veto right on the expansion of the  European Community if the Community appears to be indifferent to  the Greek positions on Skopje. Did your Greek interlocutors  mention this during your official meetings?    [Vranitzky] This is the first time I have heard this view.  Allow me not to comment, because neither the president nor the  government has raised such an issue. They haven't even made the  slightest comment during our talks. We are interested in what  the official side says, and we are not concerned with views like  those of Samaras....  <H5>  Past Problem </H5>   Discussing Alternate Foreign Minister Theodhoros Pangalos'  remarks and the atmosphere of Greek-German relations, German  Deputy Foreign Minister Helmut Schaefer said: "Pangalos'  remarks are history and couldn't affect Greek-German relations.  I do not believe it is useful to reiterate rumors of problems  because we are confirming them in some way. Following my visit  and talks with my Greek counterpart Yeoryios Papandreou, I would  describe the atmosphere as positive and the similarity of views  on many issues as significant."    Referring to Germany's Balkan policy, he said: "There is no  German Balkan policy. The German side's interest is purely  humanitarian. We want things to be stable and we need everyone  to contribute to that. The wrong impression was once created --  and we believed it too -- that the Serbs were responsible for  continuing the clashes and that if Serbia stopped fighting, the  problem would be solved.    "The problem is more complex. We must persuade all former  Yugoslav parties involved that every side must take steps to  resolve the crisis, because Europe will run out of patience at  some point. A new initiative must be undertaken to end the  prevailing situation. We are waiting for the U.S. secretary of  state to move."    Germany seems to be running out of patience on Skopje as  well. This can be seen in a response to a question on the hasty  opening of a German diplomatic delegation in Skopje. "No one  can claim that we hurried to recognize the former Republic of  Macedonia. We waited two years before establishing diplomatic  relations. During these two years, the country became a UN  member and was thus recognized by international law.    "The Greek side must get rid of its sentimentality on this  issue. It would be much worse for the Greek side if there was  instability in the region. Papandreou agreed with that. So,  Athens and Skopje must continue their dialogue and Germany is  ready to help resume the talks."    Referring to the Cyprus issue, Schaefer said: During their  visit to Turkey, the German and British Foreign Ministers Claus  Kinkel and Douglas Hurd discussed the Cyprus issue. We said  both sides involved must show greater flexibility.    Asked how he describes a common European policy for  resolving  the Bosnian crisis, the minister said: "In one sentence, it's  common European desperation...."</p>

			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Croda advances 40% to Pounds 14.3m - Buoyant performance from chemicals dominates results CRODA International, the chemicals group, yesterday reported a rebound in first-half pre-tax profits, which expanded 40 per cent, from Pounds 10.2m to Pounds 14.3m. Despite market conditions which Mr Michael Valentine, chairman, described as 'universally testing,' turnover in the six months to end-June increased by 5.8 per cent to Pounds 183.7m (Pounds 173.7m). The company, which cut its 1991 dividend after profits collapsed in the face of the recession, attributed the recovery to improving overseas sales and 'the sizeable productivity improvements made in the UK.' Earnings per share rose to 7.2p (5.1p) from which a maintained interim dividend of 2.75p is declared. The results were dominated by the record performance of the chemical companies, which produced a 35 per cent improvement in trading profits to Pounds 15.5m (Pounds 11.5m) on a 12 per cent increase in turnover to Pounds 122.8m (Pounds 109.6m). The larger UK divisions, General Chemicals, Colloids and Universal, which are big exporters and beneficiaries of recent capital expenditure, together increased sales by 21 per cent. Coatings operations also recovered from last year's setback to achieve trading profits of Pounds 3.3m (Pounds 2.7m) on turnover which slipped by Pounds 1m to Pounds 42m. Productivity gains at UK Paints more than offset a further decline in sales, but Croda's sizeable Australian industrial paint business was unable to match last year's performance. The cosmetics and toiletries business, which accounted for 10 per cent of group sales, had a 'disappointing first half even allowing for the normal seasonal weakness,' and reported a Pounds 200,000 trading loss (Pounds 200,000 profit) on turnover down from Pounds 21.1m to Pounds 18.9m. Croda said falling demand on both sides of the Channel undermined sales and put pressure on margins. In addition the company's French operation suffered disruption following a fire. COMMENT Croda's first half profits were ahead of market expectations and underline management's success in taking out costs. The company has invested in new UK plant and although there were early teething problems, the sharp profit improvement from the chemicals operations indicates these have now been overcome. Providing the sales gains in overseas markets are maintained, full year pre-tax profits of about Pounds 30.5m and earnings of 15.5p a share look possible. On that basis Croda is trading on an attractive prospective p/e of about 11.4.</p>

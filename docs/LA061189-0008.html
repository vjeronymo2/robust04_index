			<p><P> June 11, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GARDENS: PERFECTLY CONTAINED;  </P> <P> AN EXCLUSIVE BENEFIT PLANT SALE SPAWNS SOME INVENTIVE POTTED PLANTS  </P> <P> IT'S AN INTRIGUING IDEA for an annual fund-raiser: The 25 members of the  Diggers Garden Club in Pasadena each put together "10 perfect pots." The 12  best are selected by a jury and auctioned off, and the rest are sold at a  by-invitation-only sale for members and friends. But what is more intriguing  about this exclusive event is that it generates more than merely money; the  participants come up with a bounty of ideas for growing unusual plants in  inventive containers.  </P> <P> At the most recent sale in March, one pot held a "Pick Your Own Salad Bar,"  according to its label. The exotic leafy greens included red oak leaf lettuce,  radicchio, Lolla Rossa (an Italian loose-leaf lettuce) and Tango (a  bronze-leafed Batavian, or crisp-head, lettuce). In a low wide bowl grew a new  lavender phlox named 'Mrs. Crockett' (which blooms for months). In another grew  kangaroo paw. Some pots hold small topiaries, such as creeping thyme growing in  a lollipop shape. Miniature climbing roses were trained up tiny arbors.  </P> <P> Baskets are favorite containers. Most are lined with green moss or plastic and  then filled with soil. One member stacked up graduated sizes of terra-cotta  saucers and then planted succulents on each concentric ledge. Another, on a  trip overseas, shipped back several of the heavy stone troughs considered the  classiest of containers in England and then planted one of them with rare  rock-garden plants purchased in the Pacific Northwest.  </P> <P> The money raised by the Diggers Garden Club goes to the public gardens (such as  the Old Mill garden in San Marino) that the organization helps plant and  maintain.  </P></p>

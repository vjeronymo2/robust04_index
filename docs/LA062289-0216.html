UNO DISMISSES GEISHA STORY  </P> <P> The wife of Japanese Prime Minister Sosuke Uno apologized for the clamor caused  by reports her husband had paid a geisha $20,000 to have an affair with him,  but said in an interview published today that she believed he was faithful.  </P> <P> Chiyo Uno told the weekly magazine Shukan Bunshun she did not know the details  about the alleged relationship between her husband and the unidentified geisha.  </P> <P> "Of course, I believe that nothing of the sort happened," she said, adding that  early in their marriage Uno had promised to be faithful.  </P> <P> "At any rate, it's all in the past, so why should it be made an issue of now,"  Mrs. Uno said. "But I would not forgive him if he were to break his promise by  fooling around with geishas."  </P> <P> Japanese women's groups have expressed outrage over the scandal and have called  on Uno to resign.  </P></p>

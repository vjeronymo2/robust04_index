			<p>940813 FT  13 AUG 94 / Iraq 'wants peace with Israel' Iraq has expressed readiness to make peace with Israel, whose cities Baghdad targeted with Scud missiles in the 1991 Gulf war, Israeli television reported yesterday. No official comment was available on the surprise report, broadcast to Israelis accustomed to perceiving Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's government as a hardline foe. The report carried by the state-run TV organisation said Iraq had relayed a message through a third party to Israel's ambassador at the UN three months ago, expressing readiness to discuss peace. The message, written by a senior Iraqi official, said Baghdad no longer had a dispute with Israel now that the Palestinian problem was about to be resolved. However, Israel ignored the initiative on US instructions, the report said.</p>

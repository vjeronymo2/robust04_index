			<p>940314 FT  14 MAR 94 / Gridlock over London transport Britain's Treasury has become the main obstacle to improving London's public transport system. Last week Treasury ministers snubbed London Transport by blocking the promotion of Mr Alan Watkins, deputy chairman and chief executive, to the post of chairman. Transport ministers are understood to have been happy with the appointment. Mr Watkins' crime was to criticise the Chancellor Mr Kenneth Clarke for providing insufficient funds in last November's Budget for London Transport investment. Mr Watkins, a top executive at Hawker Siddeley before joining London Transport 18 months ago, was admired for bringing private sector skills to an organisation that is notoriously hard to manage. He has now resigned. If ministers wish to attract talented outsiders to public jobs, they will have to put up with blunt talking. But the Treasury's downer on London Transport is not limited to its treatment of Mr Watkins. Last month, it opposed a Pounds 500m deal to equip the Northern Line with 100 new trains. Moreover, the government is only proceeding with plans to build CrossRail, a Pounds 2bn east-west underground railway, after the prime minister overruled objections from Mr Michael Portillo, Treasury chief secretary. Even now, observers fear CrossRail could founder as the Treasury has yet to promise funds. Treasury attempts to curb government spending is perhaps understandable given the enormous budget deficit. What is not sensible is that the Treasury is also blocking initiatives by Londoners to find their own solutions to the city's transport problems. In particular, it has rejected a scheme put to it by London First, the business-led group, to earmark a portion of London's business rates for transport investment. Squalid This is not good enough. The underground is squalid, unreliable and crowded. Many people are therefore forced to travel by car so clogging the roads with traffic and slowing down buses. This is not merely miserable for those living and working in London. It also harms business and undermines the City's competitiveness as a financial centre. The total cost of modernising the underground and financing new projects such as CrossRail is put at Pounds 17bn over 10 years. Given the difficulty of providing cash from central government coffers, the Treasury should welcome ideas to tap other sources. The London First proposal would do just that. It would take advantage of the fact that London's business rates are due to fall next year. Instead of passing all the savings back to companies, a portion would be earmarked for transport improvements and channelled through a trust. The trust would not have to wait for the money to trickle in. It could issue bonds secured by the future revenue stream. Treasury theology This idea has fallen foul of Treasury theology. The first objection is that it would add to government spending and borrowing, as the scheme would be underwritten by the state. But there would be no need for such a guarantee: the flow of business rates would be security enough. The second objection stems from the Treasury's dislike of hypothecation. Treasury officials talk of the nation's tax take as 'our money'. If money is earmarked for transport in London, the Treasury fears it will have to cut spending on projects in other parts of Britain. Not only is such description of the tax take as 'our money' presumptuous. The idea that more investment in the capital's transport system must be matched by cuts elsewhere is also bunkum. According to a recent estimate, Londoners pay over Pounds 8bn a year more in taxes than is spent by government in the city. They could maintain this relationship with the rest of the UK and pay taxes earmarked for transport because such investment would add value to its economy. Not that the London First idea is perfect in every detail. Money should be raised from domestic landowners and commuters as well as business: they too would benefit from better transport. London First must also demonstrate that London business enthusiastically backs such use of its money. That would be the best way to overcome Treasury theology.</p>

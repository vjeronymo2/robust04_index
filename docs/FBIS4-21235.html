Yesterday, newly elected Social Welfare Minister Yvonne  Herlov Andersen (Democratic Center) proposed that the government  spend approximately 20 million kroner on two pilot projects  involving drug treatment according to the Italian model, in  which both the family and the addict have considerable  responsibility seeing that treatment is successful.    The Danish drug-treatment providers would like to draw  families into their work, but they warn against simply borrowing  another country's treatment system.    ``Italian and Danish culture differ significantly. Down  there, there is a much stronger tradition of families that go in  and assume responsibilities that are public responsibilities  here in Denmark,'' said Peter Ege, social welfare physician in  Copenhagen.    However, he believes that, in general, it is a good idea to  utilize the resources of the family.    ``We must not believe that family therapy is our only  salvation, but my experience is that even relatively weak  families have something to offer,'' said Anders Gormsen, head of  the Church Army's institution for the treatment of young drug  addicts.</p>

"We're headed for a political showdown with Washington," a  European permanent representative to the OECD said. "Things will  heat up over the next few months," another ambassador confirmed  in private.    Several ranking diplomats at the OECD's Paris headquarters  say the Americans are seeking to marshall support from Japan and  other non-European member countries in favour of a former  Canadian cabinet minister and politician, Donald Johnston, as  the next OECD secretary-general.    Frenchman Jean-Claude Paye, aged 59, will see his second  term  in the post expire at the end of next September, but is seeking  a third five-year term.    "The Americans do not shrink from reminding us in the  corridors that the U.S. and Japan between them contribute nearly  50 percent of the budget," a European official said, adding that  Washington considers the OECD as "Euro-centric," although a fair  share of the key jobs are held by U.S. and Japanese nationals.    Paye, who made it clear last July he would seek a third  term,  is France's official candidate.    British Prime Minister John Major has thrown his support  behind Lord (Nigel) Lawson, a chancellor of the exchequer under  his predecessor Margaret Thatcher, while Germany joined the fray  naming senior Economics Ministry official Lorentz Schomerus as  its candidate.    Belgium and Italy have also signalled possible candidacies,  but have so far not cited any names.    The Americans, the British and some other OECD governments  believe the OECD, which will not for long remain an "exclusive  club" of rich industrial countries, will need a "political  heavyweight" at the helm to raise its world-wide visibility.    Others believe their purposes will be better served by a  non-political chief executive seeking to defend the collective  cause of its 24 members. They want to preserve its "impartial  analysis" of the whole range of current economic, social and  technological problems.    Well-placed diplomats say the Clinton Administration appears  to be taking a new interest in the organization, now perceived  as a useful instrument for U.S. foreign policy and domestic  economic objectives.    "The Americans believe, for instance, that the OECD could be  used more effectively in their efforts to open up the Japanese  market," a European ambassador commented.    A confidential OECD study on labour markets and ways to  reverse the rise of OECD unemployment, which could touch 35  million this year, is another case in point.    The study will be in focus at President Clinton's "jobs  summit" at Detroit from March 13 to 15, officials said.    Washington has picked this domain to launch a campaign  against Paye by leaking official U.S. documents critical of the  OECD's views, European diplomats said.    U.S. Ambassador to the OECD David Aaron in a letter accused  the OECD secretariat of failing to play a "positive" role in  calling for lower interest rates and more growth in Europe as a  remedy for run-away unemployment.    Rejecting U.S. charges of "Euro-centrism," several OECD  ambassadors said the organization had indeed changed since Paye  took the helm nearly 10 years ago.    They cited the opening in the 1980's of a "dialogue" with  the  dynamic Asian economies, now extended to emerging Latin American  countries as well, and moves in the past four years to open up  to the former communist states of East Europe, including Russia.    "It is evident that more changes are in the offing," one  ranking European diplomat said. Three East European countries  are knocking on the OECD's door, while Mexico is set to become  its 25th member within a few months and Korea may follow suit  around l996.    Whatever Paye's own record, the succession is an  "excessively  complex" issue because it is indirectly linked to the election  of a new European Community Commission president, one ambassador  said.    "The horse-trading is well under way," he added.    A "neutral" European official said the choice would be all  the more difficult because Canada's Johnston was "hardly known  in the outside world" and because some capitals would find it  hard to accept Nigel Lawson, a "retired Thatcherite."</p>

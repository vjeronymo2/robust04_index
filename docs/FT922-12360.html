			<p>920418 FT  18 APR 92 / Words that spell business failure PHRASES such as 'optimistic about the future', 'thanks to our bankers for their support' and 'poised to take advantage' in the chairman's statement in a company's annual report may spell the end of the business, a study has suggested. The more incomprehensible the chairman's statement, it adds, the greater the likelihood that the business is in financial difficulties, a study has suggested. Two academics have attempted to provide a simple way of assessing corporate health by analysing chairmen's statements in reports which UK companies produced in the 1980s. Mr Malcolm Smith, of the school of economics, commerce and law at Murdoch University in Australia, and Professor Richard Taffler, of the City University Business School in London, found clear patterns when they examined the reports of 66 companies, half of which survive and half of which have failed. They found that the statements from the failed companies' chairmen used sentences containing more words, and words with more letters and syllables. In a separate piece of research they found a correlation between the incidence of particular words and phrases and imminent collapse. The most fatal signs are nominal or non-payment of dividends, followed by any mention of closure, sale or disposal, bank support, loss and overdraft, loans or borrowing. Reference to 'future loss' is a slightly stronger indicator of failure than 'future profit' but 'new managing director appointed' is more negative than 'managing director resigns'. A paper the academics presented at the British Accounting Association annual conference at Warwick University concluded: 'Poor readability is associated with poor financial performance and ease of readability with relative financial success.'  ------------------------------------------------------- COMPANIES THAT FAIL: chairmen's statements  ------------------------------------------------------- 'No dividend' 'Nominal dividend' 'Closure' 'Disposal' 'Sale' 'Bank support' 'Loss' 'Loans' 'Borrowing' 'Overdraft' 'Unprofitable' 'Future loss' 'Recession' 'Future profit' 'Growth' No mention of dividend Chairman or managing director resigns New managing director appointed  ------------------------------------------------------- Words and phrases that occur, or are omitted, in statements from companies that fail  -------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p><P> January 14, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SOCKERS' MOMENTUM HALTED BY ST. LOUIS  </P> <P> Cleveland giveth, St. Louis taketh away.  </P> <P> Yes, just 24 hours after the Sockers turned in their most convincing home  victory of the season against the Cleveland Crunch, the St. Louis Storm, an  upstart expansion franchise, pulled out a pin, deflated the Sockers' confidence  and burst their two-game winning streak. St. Louis 7, Sockers 4.  </P> <P> This game played before 9,189 at the San Diego Sports Arena was on fast  forward, both sides employing the counter attack. The Storm (10-11) took  control briefly in the third quarter, taking advantage of a delay-of-game  penalty assessed to Socker midfielder Brian Quinn when former Socker Fernando  Clavijo scored 2:03 into the period.  </P> <P> Socker forward Zoran Karic gave the Sockers a dash of hope a little more than a  minute later, flashing some magical footwork in front of defender Emil  Dragicevic, blowing past him to the left and drilling the ball past goalie  Slobo Ilijevski. From then on, things came unglued.  </P> <P> St. Louis midfielder Claudio De Oliveira scored 5:21 into the fourth quarter  and again at 10:42, after the Sockers had put in defender Kevin Crow as the  sixth attacker. The victory pulled the Storm into a second-place tie with the  Sockers (10-11), three games behind first-place Dallas in the Western Division  of the Major Indoor Soccer League.  </P> <P> A noticeably shaken team held a closed-door meeting after the game to iron out  problems and plan for an upcoming four-game trip. Midfielder Brian Quinn and  veteran Steve Zungul, who hasn't suited up for the past seven games, spoke at  length about the team's difficulties. Socker Coach Ron Newman explained it to  reporters.  </P> <P> "What can you say about that one?" he asked. "Our weakness defensively early in  the game was evident.  </P> <P> "(St. Louis) is a good side. They're better than when we played them last.  They're certainly better than Cleveland."  </P> <P> The Crunch has been the one saving grace for the Sockers, who have defeated  them with relative ease in all three meetings this season. But because they  can't play them in all 52 games, the Sockers still have to be wondering when  their inconsistencies will fall by the wayside.  </P> <P> Both teams got the most out of the first half, at least offensively. St. Louis  led, 4-3, at halftime, after taking a 2-0 lead in the first quarter on goals by  defender Mark Frederickson and forward Terry Brown.  </P> <P> With 4:26 remaining in the quarter, the Sockers executed a nice fake on a  restart kick, midfielder Branko Segota faking the shot and midfielder Waad  Hirmez sending it in to the left corner with his left foot. But less than a  minute later, forward Stan Terlecki gave the Storm another two-goal cushion,  following a blocked shot by goalie Victor Nogueira and scoring with his right  foot.  </P> <P> Crow made it 3-2 before the quarter ended, scoring his fifth goal of the season  off an assist from Karic.  </P> <P> Socker forward Jim Gabarra scored his first goal of the season in the second  quarter to tie the score, 3-3. Once again the Storm retaliated quickly, forward  Godfrey Ingram scoring on a long pass from De Oliveira to give St. Louis a 4-3  halftime lead.  </P> <P> And that play was as indicative as any of the Sockers inability on this night  to play consistent defense. Ingram was all by himself without a Socker defender  in shouting distance.  </P> <P> "That was a killing goal," Newman said. "From my point of view that was a  terrible goal. Somebody missed an assignment. That was critical, just when the  momentum was starting to swing our way."  </P> <P> The loss was critical too, just when the momentum was starting to swing the  Sockers way. This is all about the pride of a seven-time champion.  </P> <P> "We feel we're paid to win, we're not paid to just play," Crow said. "I think a  lot of people feel they're paid to just play. We're not like that. You can't  accept mediocrity."  </P> <P> If things don't change, the Sockers may soon have to learn.  </P> <P> Socker Notes  </P> <P> Three Storm players are former Sockers: forward Gary Heale, and defenders Gus  Mokalis and Fernando Clavijo. Mokalis was on the Sockers' championship team  last season, Clavijo played from 1984-88 and Heale played on the Sockers'  outdoor team in the North American Soccer League in 1983. . . . The Sockers and  the Storm took turns tripping each other in the second quarter Saturday. First,  midfielder Ben Collins planted his foot in the path of Clavijo, who took a nose  dive and had to be helped off the carpet. Minutes later, Storm forward Stan  Terlecki came off the bench early on a substitution and, in the process,  tripped defender George Fernandez, who dropped in the same manner as Clavijo.  Both returned later in the quarter. . . . Midfielder Branko Segota moved into  first place on the Sockers' all-time assist scoring list with 214 when he  assisted on forward Damir Haramina's goal in Friday's 4-1 victory over  Cleveland.  </P></p>

			<p>920102 FT  02 JAN 92 / Letter: Electricity generators are manipulating the market Sir, Your readers may have had difficulty understanding Mr John Baker's letter justifying peaks in the pool electricity prices (Letters, December 2). I suggest this is because he is trying to defend the indefensible. The facts are these. There is 58,000 MW of generating capacity in the UK. Normally in the order of 54,000 MW is available for use. As the peak afternoon period approaches, the generators are inexplicably withdrawing capacity, reducing available capacity to nearer 52,000 MW. Obviously, as in any market, if you reduce supplies when demand is rising, the price shoots up. This is precisely what the generators are doing - reducing available capacity at a time when demand goes up. There is firm evidence to support these allegations. On Tuesday December 3 the late afternoon pool price reached 19.15p per unit, the highest ever recorded. The regional electricity companies confirm that there were no unseasonably high demands and temperatures were generally above the seasonal norm. However, available capacity was reduced to 1,200 MW below the November maximum when it should have been increased in line with the normal onset of winter. More importantly, however, maximum available capacity was 52,733 MW compared with 57,060 MW for the equivalent day in 1990 (Tuesday December 4). It is quite clear from these figures that the generators are manipulating the market in a way that cannot have been anticipated when the pricing formulae that accompanied privatisation were drawn up. This is manifestly against the consumers' interests and cannot be condoned. It is also quite unrealistic to introduce such spurious arguments as a need to attract new generators into the industry. In effect, this amounts to depreciating generating plant on a replacement cost basis. There are few manufacturers who do not wish they were able to adopt this practice and pass on the cost to their customers. In the real world, the market simply does not allow such accounting techniques to be passed on in the selling prices. These real-world market-place rules should apply equally to the electricity generators. Andrew Cook, chairman, William Cook Plc, Parkway Avenue, Sheffield S9 4WA.</p>

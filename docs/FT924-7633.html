			<p>921116 FT  16 NOV 92 / Ankara plans telecoms sale TURKEY intends to sell 20 per cent of the state telecommunications monopoly, and hopes to raise Dollars 2.3bn (Pounds 1.5bn), Mrs Tansu Ciller, chief economics minister, has told Turkish industrialists. The sale would be Turkey's largest privatisation, and is certain to attract strong foreign interest, although industry officials suggest there is still considerable groundwork to do before the company is ready for sale. Mr Yasar Topcu, minister for transport and communications, confirmed plans to split the PTT between the postal and telecoms services to pave the way for eventual privatisation. Industry officials say it still requires a change in the law to allow an operator other than the PTT into the telecoms sector. The government has already sold PTT's two manufacturing subsidiaries, Netas and Teletas. Mr Topcu said the recent private-sector tender for mobile telephones, won by Netas, a subsidiary of Northern Telecom of Canada, underlined the government's aim to sell the entire operation. Mr Fikret Ucel, head of Teletas, now part-owned by Alcatel of France, said it was too early to think of selling PTT. According to the 1991 accounts, the telecoms division accounts for 89 per cent of PTT's operating revenues of TL10,459bn (Pounds 850m). The company made an operating profit of TL580bn. It employs about 90,000 people.</p>

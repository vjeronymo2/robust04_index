			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Vadim Byrkin and Mikhail Karlov] </F>   [Excerpts] Moscow, 14 Mar -- The dumping of liquid  radioactive waste into the Sea of Japan by vessels of the  Pacific Fleet will only be carried out with the permission of  the Russian Government. The Russian Naval Forces press center  said this today in response to a request by an ITAR-TASS  correspondent for a comment on a report by the Japanese paper  MAINICHI.    The paper reported today, citing Valeriy Danilyan, the chief  of the Pacific Fleet Chemical Service, that Russia could resume  the dumping of waste in the Sea of Japan in May this year unless  foreign countries, including Japan, provided financial help with  building facilities to use and store liquid radioactive waste.  The Russian Naval Forces press center said that this was the  personal view of one of the Pacific Fleet leaders. However, the  government has so far not made a decision on the dumping of  waste in the Sea of Japan. [passage omitted]    Only the use of special facilities for rendering the waste  harmless can solve the problem. A Finance Ministry  representative recently said at a session of a government  commission that the issue of allocating money for these problems  will be resolved very soon.    It should be noted that Russia has not received the help  promised by Western countries for the construction of the  facilities. And the tanker for the storage and transportation  of radioactive waste offered by Japan turned out to be wholly  unsuitable for use.</p>

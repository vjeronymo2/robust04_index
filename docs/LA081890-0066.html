			<p><P> August 18, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> POLICE DON'T MEAN SECURITY  </P> <P> Remember the days when the sight of a police officer made you feel secure? He  was a protector of your rights!  </P> <P> Those days are apparently over in Ventura County -- at least from what I read  in the L.A. Times. In horror, I read parallel stories of Ventura County women  harassed by Ventura County "peace" officers for wanting to help injured  children. The following Thursday (July 26) I read of a Ventura policeman who  used a stun gun nine times on a helpless disabled man.  </P> <P> Am I really reading this? A stranglehold used on a woman for protesting the  anti-human acts of "law" men? A stun gun used on a helpless man for "causing"  an accident?  </P> <P> (And I am reading this within two weeks after returning from the Berlin Wall.  What country am I in?).  </P> <P> Yet the worst thing is to read that district attorneys -- our "public  defenders" -- insist that these officers were only performing their duty! As a  former professor in two university-run police academies (as well as a  grandmother), I am outraged -- and embarrassed for those many fine law  enforcement officers who still maintain a sense of personal dignity, restraint  and dedication, yet must live and work in the paranoidal atmosphere that  permeates the law enforcement offices in Ventura County.  </P> <P> Perhaps it is time we put warning signs up for those entering Ventura County:  "Enter at your own risk: Lawmen dangerous to your health. First Amendment  rights -- to say nothing of the Second, Third or Fourth -- do not apply here."  </P> <P> In the case of the Thousand Oaks woman who retorted "offensively" to the  sheriff's deputy, let me affirm: No self-respecting woman in America would have  acted any differently than this "doctor's wife."  </P> <P> Did I say "doctor's wife"? The sheriff's deputy who allegedly held a  stranglehold on this woman said " . . . just because she's a doctor's wife  doesn't mean she can . . . " etc. By focusing not by her own identity but only  in relation to her husband -- and carrying out her act on this basis (if the  L.A. Times story is correct), the officer showed a pathetic need of awareness  training in what sexism is.  </P> <P> JUDITH A. JOHNSON  </P> <P> Channel Islands Harbor  </P></p>

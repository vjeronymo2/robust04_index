			<p><P> January 27, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> GOP ATTEMPT TO TAKE WRIGHT OFF COMMITTEE FAILS  </P> <P> Assembly Republicans on Thursday failed to oust Assemblywoman Cathie Wright  from her seat on the powerful Rules Committee, mustering only 25 of the  required 41 votes.  </P> <P> GOP lawmakers have sought to remove the Simi Valley Republican since early last  month when she failed to join them in supporting the candidacy of a dissident  Democrat challenging Assembly Speaker Willie Brown of San Francisco.  </P> <P> The Assembly floor vote Thursday was 25 to 1 to replace Wright on the committee  with Assemblyman Robert C. Frazee (R-Carlsbad). Wright was the only member to  oppose Frazee, with 54 lawmakers, including all 46 Democrats, either not voting  or absent.  </P> <P> Wright has steadfastly refused to relinquish her seat on the Rules Committee,  which oversees the housekeeping operations of the lower house and assigns bills  to committees. After the vote, she declared the matter "closed. The vote has  been taken. That's it."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Disappointed by Move  </P> <P> Wright, 59, who was elected to a fifth term in November, said that she was  disappointed by the action of her colleagues but vowed that "it doesn't change  my philosophy."  </P> <P> The dispute has had a widening political impact. On the local level, it has  publicized the split between Wright and neighboring Assemblywoman Marian W. La  Follette (R-Northridge), who launched the effort to remove her GOP colleague.  </P> <P> Wright maintained that her refusal to resign from the committee also sparked  opposition Thursday to her bill to allow the Simi Valley Unified School  District to raise its bonded indebtedness, as sought in a $35-million bond  issue on the March 7 ballot. As a result, Assembly floor action on the bill was  postponed until next week.  </P> <P> In the Assembly, lawmakers suggested that the Wright controversy is an example  of how the lower house has become bogged down in internal housekeeping matters  because of differences between Brown and new Republican Leader Ross Johnson  (R-La Habra).  </P> <P> </P> <P> Democratic Defense  </P> <P> During the sometimes angry debate, Democrats defended Wright, a staunch  conservative. For example, Assemblyman Tom Bane (D-Van Nuys), chairman of the  Rules Committee, praised Wright as "an excellent member of the Rules  Committee."  </P> <P> The Republican action is "one of punishing her . . . because she refused to  vote for a Democrat for Speaker," Bane said.  </P> <P> When the Assembly began its current session, Wright abstained from voting for a  new Speaker, claiming that she had told her constituents she would not vote for  a Democrat. Most of her Republican colleagues supported Assemblyman Charles  Calderon (D-Whittier), a member of the "Gang of Five" that challenged Brown's  leadership last year.  </P> <P> Johnson denied that the move to remove Wright was an effort to punish her for  not supporting Calderon. He said that the central issue is whether a majority  of the GOP members have a right to decide the Republican membership on  committees.  </P> <P> He maintained that traditionally members of one party went along with Rules  Committee choices of the other party. "That tradition for the first time has  been broken," Johnson said. That assertion was later denied by Bane.  </P> <P> Johnson also expressed hope that the bitterness over Wright's Rules Committee  seat "was not an indication of the kind of house we're going to have for the  next two years."  </P> <P> That prompted Assemblyman Elihu M. Harris (D-Oakland) to shout an expletive at  Johnson, yelling "It's up to you."  </P> <P> In response, Johnson said: "Well, Mr. Harris, it's up to all of us. It's up to  all 80 of us. . . ."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Compromise Choice  </P> <P> Earlier this month, the Republican caucus agreed to remove Wright from the  committee. However, neither La Follette nor several other challengers could  muster a majority of votes in the caucus to take the matter to the floor. On  Thursday, Frazee emerged as a compromise choice to replace Wright.  </P> <P> In the meantime, Wright maintained that she encountered opposition to her Simi  Valley schools bill because of her refusal to step down.  </P> <P> Wright said that the legislation was identical to a bill that passed last year  allowing the Simi Valley school district to extend repayment of state loans if  local voters approved general-obligation bonds. As a result, school district  officials were able to advertise that a vote for the bond was a vote for a  tax-rate decrease.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, voters defeated the bond measure for renovations on existing  school structures. The issue is scheduled to go before voters again in March.  To again boost its chances, Wright has introduced similar legislation.  </P> <P> Assemblyman Steve Peace (D-La Mesa) branded the measure a "horrible piece of  legislation."  </P> <P> Because of the controversy, Wright agreed to delay action until next week.  </P></p>

			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading THE withdrawal of GPA's global share offer, the poor overnight performances on Wall Street and Tokyo, and a gloomy outlook for several leading UK stocks, combined to unsettle stock index futures in a volatile session, writes Joel Kibazo. On its last full day of trading ahead of today's expiry, the June FT-SE contract opened at 2,571 and was briefly squeezed forward to 2,574. But that momentum was curtailed as the market focused on the poor showing in other leading markets and the news from GPA. James Capel was also reported to have had a sizeable seller, all of which caused a retreat in the June future. A rally was, however, seen late morning which sent June climbing to 2,575. But that petered out in the early afternoon after downgradings of profits expectations following a meeting at ICI, leaving the contract to drift to the day's low of 2,552. A rally just before the official market close resulted in June finishing at 2,565, a five-point premium to the cash market, as turnover reached 10,844 lots. In the traded options market, trading in the FT-SE option, which expires today, took centre stage as a total of 21,821 contracts were transacted out of the day's market total of 39,745 lots.</p>

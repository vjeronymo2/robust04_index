			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Amritsar, 27 Nov (TINS)--India has registered  its protest against the recent move by Pakistan to deploy army  personnel in the guise of Pakistan Rangers on the Indo-Pakistan  border.    The protest was registered during the two-day biannual  meeting of officials of the Border Security Force (BSF) and  Pakistan Rangers, held here this week.    The army soldiers were reportedly deployed during the  general  elections in Pakistan, apparently to strengthen the vigil on the  border. In the normal course, the armies of both the nations  must remain about 5 km inside the border as the protection of  the border is entrusted to the BSF in India and the Pakistan  Rangers.</p>

It seems that  Britain focuses more attention on its long-term interests than  on its long-term allies. So it is no coincidence that mutual  interests have brought Britain and Azerbaijan closer.  Considering requirements earlier this century, British  officials have turned to Azerbaijan again, never mind that 70  years have passed since the last time. Several officials have  linked that with Britain's bid for Baku's oil. But Britain,  which has established links with the Caucasus as one of the most  developed countries, maintains more serious objectives, which  will serve stability in the region.    Of course, all that will be widely discussed in the  high-level talks between Britain and Azerbaijan in London.  Undoubtedly, President Geydar Aliyev and Prime Minister John  Major will deliberate on the dispute between Azerbaijan and  Armenia and try to establish a way to remove the dispute.  Britain's position on it is common knowledge. After Turkey, it  was the second country to establish its final approach to the  Karabakh dispute. And it did that long ago. Perhaps that is  why President Ter-Petrosyan left Britain with empty hands at the  end of his visit there 10 days ago. He visited Britain with a  great deal of hope.    But malicious circles in Azerbaijan have described President  Aliyev's visit as an effort to seek Western support. They have  made unreasonable and wrong statements in that regard. There is  nothing in Azerbaijan's cooperation with Britain to harm the  interests of third countries. Naturally, Azerbaijan also wishes  to cooperate with France, Germany, Russia, and several other  countries. Everyone knows that those countries have adopted a  [word indistinct] approach to Azerbaijan's sincere wish to  cooperate with them.    The bilateral agreements that will be signed during  President  Aliyev's visit to London will further consolidate the legal and  political basis of bilateral relations. Consequently, our  relations will become more productive. The cooperation with  Britain, which is a leading country in modern technology in  industry and agriculture, will create an opportunity for  Azerbaijan to reorganize its industry somewhat.    And President Aliyev's visit may lead to surprising and  favorable developments. Naturally, all that will create a new  opportunity for Azerbaijan to improve its cooperation with  Western countries.</p>

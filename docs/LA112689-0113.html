			<p><P> November 26, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> INSPECTORS GO UNDERCOVER TO HELP CONSUMERS GET A GOOD SLEEP;  </P> <P> WATCHDOGS: MATTRESS CHECKERS ARE SERIOUS ABOUT THAT TAG THAT SAYS "DO NOT  REMOVE UNDER PENALTY OF LAW."  </P> <P> At first blush, the 20 rebuilt mattresses looked new as they were wheeled out  of the bulky sterilizing oven at Cousin Jack's Mattress Co.  </P> <P> Then Joann Johnson, one of a handful of state inspectors who monitor the  furniture industry, ordered a worker to cut one open.  </P> <P> Peering inside, Johnson discovered a dirty old mattress that had not been  renovated at all. Cousin Jack's had simply sewn a fresh cover over the beat-up  bedding, which may well have been lying on a street corner a week earlier.  </P> <P> "This is a no-no. You can't do this," declared the state Bureau of Home  Furnishings employee, who proceeded to temporarily withhold 60 rebuilts from  sale.  </P> <P> Caught red-handed, the longtime operator of the Santa Fe Springs factory agreed  at once to rip off the old covers. But James Haske Jr. insisted that there was  nothing wrong with the practice. "With the sterilization," he said, "I figured  that killed any living organism."  </P> <P> Such is the world of the rebuilt mattress, a burgeoning but low-profile  industry light-years removed from the environment of luxury sleep shops.  </P> <P> Across Los Angeles County, 50 low-budget factories churn out anywhere from 10  to 500 rebuilts daily.  </P> <P> The mattresses, normally stripped to the springs and repaired, are marketed at  dozens of retail discount furniture stores and thrift shops, primarily in  low-income neighborhoods.  </P> <P> For new immigrants or impoverished families -- who are believed to account for  the bulk of the purchases -- a spanking-fresh rebuilt set may seem a real  bargain at $60 retail. Considering the alternative -- new mattresses generally  cost upward of $500 -- it frequently is.  </P> <P> But all too often, manufacturers cut corners to make up for low profit margins,  state officials say. And rarely are they caught or prosecuted, the officials  add.  </P> <P> "In many instances, they don't sterilize them. And then they will merely put a  brand-new cover over the existing mattress. The cover will be very badly  stained with urine, blood and goodness knows what else," said Gordon H. Damant,  chief of the state home furnishings bureau. "(But) it's the kind of situation  that unless someone becomes suspicious of something, there's no way to check."  </P> <P> The problem, added Damant, is "Who looks inside? You have to destroy it  basically to look inside of it."  </P> <P> As a result, complaints are rare.  </P> <P> Yet, state lab test records in Sacramento show that Los Angeles rebuilt bedding  manufacturers have repeatedly violated state codes requiring the sterilization  of rebuilt mattresses.  </P> <P> Although Damant's agency is responsible for monitoring rebuilts, the  second-hand mattress industry is a low-priority matter for a bureau with only  five inspectors statewide to police 24,000 furniture and bedding retailers,  wholesalers and manufacturers.  </P> <P> The agency, which also is responsible for keeping tabs on manufacturer claims  and on the flammability standards for all furniture and bedding, is cautious  about imposing penalties, which can include statewide product sales bans or  fines of $2,500 per offense.  </P> <P> Mattresses may be the most personal of furnishings -- the average person spends  roughly one-third of his life on one. But the skeletons for rebuilts are  gathered in the most impersonal of ways.  </P> <P> "We buy from motels, apartment houses, colleges," and in smaller lots of ones  and twos "that come in from the street," said Don Franco of the giant Gateway  Mattress Co. in Montebello. "We go out and we will purchase any old mattresses  and box springs and hide-a-bed sleepers that we can possibly get our hands on."  </P> <P> In many Los Angeles County communities, officials said, most discarded  mattresses left outside on trash day are hauled off in scavengers' pickups  hours before the rubbish truck arrives.  </P> <P> Franco describes typical mattress scavengers, who earn from $3 to $7 for each  unit, as "rummies . . . who do it so they have enough to eat for a couple of  days. . . . (They are) basically trash peddlers who scavenge aluminum cans or  cardboard if not mattresses."  </P> <P> Franco is the king of rebuilts, the largest manufacturer of his kind in the  state, and probably the nation. Each day, 500 mattresses are renovated and  sterilized at his Montebello factory, located in a grimy industrial area across  the street from a gasoline distribution terminal.  </P> <P> At the heart of Franco's business are "cores" -- used mattresses that serve as  the frames for the rebuilt product.  </P> <P> Behind his plant, more than 20,000 cores are stacked 20 to 30 high, exposed to  the elements. The cores, which come in myriad sizes, colors and floral  patterns, sit like silage for months before being forklifted into the plant.  </P> <P> To rebuild a mattress, Gateway workers cut off the old cover and check for and  repair broken coils.  </P> <P> They then add cotton padding and a smolder-resistant layer of foam and sew on a  new cover -- along with a red "Do Not Remove" tag to identify the material  inside as second-hand.  </P> <P> The finished product is baked in a sterilizing oven for two hours at a  temperature that reaches 205 degrees. State codes also mandate that  formaldehyde, a substance on the state list of cancer-causing chemicals, be  pumped into the oven to ensure that any contaminants are eliminated.  </P> <P> Franco admits that "at one point, rebuilders had the reputation of fly-by-night  operations." But he contends that rebuilt mattresses are generally a good buy,  particularly when one considers the lack of quality in inexpensive new  mattresses.  </P> <P> But there are serious problems, as well.  </P> <P> Some retailers have been known to misrepresent the used mattresses as new by  tearing off the red "second-hand materials" tags that must be affixed to  rebuilts, officials say. Moreover, it is difficult to tell the quality of an  individual mattress because the quality of the cores and the extent of  rebuilding, if any, can vary so much.  </P> <P> There also is the question of sanitary standards.  </P> <P> Damant said the bureau is concerned about the carcinogenic properties of the  sanitizing agent formaldehyde, but says no adequate substitute has been agreed  upon.  </P> <P> And although there have been no illnesses directly attributed to inadequately  sterilized rebuilt mattresses, the state's Damant says health officials believe  "the potential is there for the spread of disease."  </P> <P> Even Gateway, regarded by state officials as one of the cleanest rebuilt  operations in California, has been repeatedly accused of inadequate  sterilization of rebuilt mattresses. Bureau records inspected by The Times show  that in seven of the last 10 years, Gateway rebuilts tested in the state lab  have failed to meet sterilization standards.  </P> <P> Officials of two other large-scale Los Angeles rebuilders acknowledged in  recent interviews that they regularly sew new covers over old mattresses,  sterilize them and send them to market. Both said they were totally unaware of  the requirement that dirty covers be removed.  </P> <P> At Cousin Jack's, which manufactures about 100 rebuilts daily, Haske agreed  that the average consumer might be unpleasantly surprised to learn of the  practice. But the 10-year company co-owner contended that until inspector  Johnson's recent visit -- accompanied by a Times reporter and photographer --  he was never informed that old, stained covers must be removed.  </P> <P> Nicholas Panza, president of Goodwill Industries of Southern California, said  Goodwill stores regularly sell rebuilts that have old mattress covers inside.  But like Haske, he said he was unaware of any prohibitions. "As long as we put  a new cover on it and sterilize it."  </P> <P> Damant, however, insisted that the state codes are clear: All rebuilt  mattresses must be sterilized and dirty covers must be replaced.  </P> <P> "The law is very specific," the bureau chief said. "It says if you have a  filthy or soiled cover that the mattress cover must be cleaned or replaced. . .  . In order to take the mattress cover off and clean it, you'd have to destroy  the cover."  </P> <P> As it stands, the bureau's investigative resources are stretched to the limit.  </P> <P> Some of Los Angeles County's 25 to 50 rebuilt mattress factories go several  years without inspections. "You can do maybe the tip of the iceberg," Damant  said. "You're basically spot-checking whatever you're looking at."  </P> <P> The state lab examines 10 to 30 mattresses a month, about 10% of the total  furniture products it tests. Even then, there is a long backlog.  </P> <P> When a reporter visited the lab in late August, technicians were examining a  rebuilt from Castro Mattress in Lynwood that had been shipped to Sacramento in  May. Inside the new cover was a dirty, old mattress. Whether it was ever  sterilized will never be known. Any traces of formaldehyde would be long gone  in three months, according to Damant.  </P> <P> When lab tests determine that rebuilts have not been sterilized, Damant's  customary practice is to write a letter to the factory requesting that it shape  up its equipment and procedures. "Sometimes they are not even aware they have a  problem until they get a negative result from us," he says.  </P> <P> His role, he says, is to seek compliance, not to close down businesses.  </P> <P> "By and large, most of the people in the second-hand business are very small  and even if you take them to the district attorney's office, so what?," Damant  asked. "What are you going to accomplish?  </P></p>

			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / Markets: Turning on the optimism - Bottom Line British Gas' 2m shareholders have been 'amused and bemused, but not rebellious' in recent years as they watched their company struggle against a rising tide of regulatory pressure to abolish its monopoly markets in the UK. That was the view of Richard Giordano, British Gas chairman, last Thursday as he and other senior executives set out the company's future dividend policy and corporate strategy to City analysts. Shareholders may also have been 'confused,' given the contradictory signals which the company has been sending to the market of late. At Thursday's presentation, the first such strategy session in many years, Giordano said the regulatory fog of the last three years had lifted enough to offer a coherent view of business prospects to the end of the decade. The view, although not entirely rosy, was generally positive. And the management was confident enough to give an assurance that as long as there were no 'untoward regulatory shocks,' British Gas should be able to increase future dividends, as well as finance its business strategy in a prudent manner. The optimistic statement was in sharp contrast to two dividend warnings issued earlier this year. Most analysts believe those expressions of deep pessimism had more to do with the company's political lobbying effort than with underlying business conditions. But the uncertainty they engendered among shareholders and analysts alike was one of the factors behind the recent under-performance of British Gas shares. 'Shareholders can sleep more easily now after a disturbed summer of scary comments from the company,' said Simon Flowers, an analyst with Natwest Markets in Edinburgh. That view is shared by other analysts, although there is still uncertainty over whether the 'progressive' dividend policy announced by the company will result in real increases. Paul Spedding, of London brokers Kleinwort Benson, says the new dividend policy means that, 'at worst, British gas shares will be equivalent to an index-linked gilt.' He says the company's decision to shift its dividend policy from one based on earnings to a new formula linked to cash flow will allow it to 'hold the dividend in real terms.' But it is not clear how much scope the company will have for real increases. Flowers says his calculations suggests there should be some room for real growth in coming years. Under the new cash formula, last year's dividend would have been covered 3.6 times. Natwest forecasts suggest the cash dividend cover will be four times by 1996-97 well within the lower limit set by British Gas. Much depends on the success of the current restructuring programme, in which the company is aiming to reduce its annual cost base by Pounds 600m by 1998, largely through the elimination of 25,000 jobs, a third of the workforce. Another big factor will be the pace at which earnings are boosted by the company's rising oil and gas production profile, the main engine for earnings growth to the end of the decade, according to company officials. The generally upbeat tone of Thursday's presentation suggests that the company has also reassessed the likely impact of the government's decision to introduce full competition into the domestic gas market by 1998, when consumers will also be able to choose between different electricity suppliers. Although British Gas is likely to lose a healthy slice of the domestic market to its would-be rivals, analysts say there is a good chance that the government might agree to delay the phased introduction of competition from 1996 to 1997. That would give the company more breathing space in which to create a commercially-oriented business unit able to compete head-to-head with the independents. Although it is bound to lose market share, British Gas will remain the monopoly transporter of gas to 18m households, a function which accounts for about half the retail cost of gas.</p>

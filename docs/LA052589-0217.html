			<p><P> May 25, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> TIGERS' PITCHER JACK MORRIS PUT ON 21-DAY DISABLED LIST  </P> <P> Detroit Tigers' right-hander Jack Morris was placed on the 21-day disabled list  for the first time in his 13-year career today because of an elbow injury.  </P> <P> Morris has an "injury to the support structure of the inner side of the elbow"  said Dr. David J. Collon, a team physician.  </P> <P> It is unknown when Morris suffered the injury, but the 34-year-old pitcher  approached the team doctor after being shelled for four home runs in Monday's  7-3 loss to Cleveland.  </P> <P> Morris opened the season with six straight losses and now is 2-7 with a 4.94  ERA. He is baseball's winningest pitcher of the 1980s with 158 of his 179  career wins coming in this decade.  </P> <P> The Tigers called up right-hander Randy Nosek from their Class AA farm club at  London, Ontario.  </P></p>

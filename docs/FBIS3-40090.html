Although  economic statistics for the entire year are not yet available,  the major outlines of the economic growth rate and economic  operation are already very apparent. China's economy during 1993  will be characterized by two main components: Overheating and  control of overheating. We can gain numerous insights from a  review of the operation of the economy in 1993.  <H3>  Beginning Phase: High Speed Operation in the Midst of a  "Heat Wave" </H3>   In forecasting China's economy during 1993, at the end of  1992 most economists believed that economic growth momentum  would weaken in early 1993 and that economic growth for the year  would be about 10 percent, an amount somewhat less than the  12.98 percent of 1992. However, not long after the beginning of  1993, some surprises occurred in the economic growth rate.  During the first quarter, GDP increased 14.1 percent over the  same period in 1992; gross industrial output value increased  22.4 percent; state-owned unit investment in fixed assets  increased 70 percent; and total retail sales of social  commodities increased 16.2 percent. During the second quarter,  the economy continued ultra high-speed growth, gross industrial  output value increasing 25.1 percent for the first half of the  year, including a record-breaking 30.2 percent increase for  June. Investment in social fixed assets increased 61 percent,  including a 70.7 percent increase for state-owned units. Total  social commodity retail sales increased 21.6 percent, and GDP  increased 13.9 percent. Clearly, economic growth for the year  certainly could not be pegged at 10 percent.  <H3>  Inflation and "Bottlenecks": Two Manifestations of  Overheating </H3>   With the quickening of economic growth, quite a few people  in  China and abroad noted evidence of another overheating of  China's economy. However, one cannot determine whether an  economy is overheating simply by looking at the size of the  economy's absolute speed of growth. One has to look at whether  the supply of resources meets economic growth needs, and whether  marked inflation occurs. Throughout 1993, China's economic  growth was accompanied by marked inflation. In addition, the  energy and raw and processed materials "bottlenecks" --  particularly transportation -- also became worse and worse.    Let us look at prices first. During the first half of the  year, retail prices nationwide increased 10.5 percent over the  same period in 1992. The cost of living price index for city and  countryside residents increased 13 percent, the cost of living  index for staff members and workers in 35 large- and medium-  sized cities rose 17.4 percent.    Let us look next at the "bottlenecks." The worst  "bottleneck"  was railroad transportation. During 1992, the railroads were  able to satisfy only about 50 percent of freight transportation  demand, and during 1993 the railroad transportation shortage  increased without letup. The various actions of the Ministry of  Railways proved utterly inadequate.    Raw and processed materials also became more and more  difficult to obtain. In 1992, prices of the means of production  increased approximately 25 percent, and during the first quarter  of 1993, the overall means of production price level nationwide  increased 38 percent over the same period in 1992. In  mid-January, the price of wire rods in Kunming reached 3,800  yuan per ton, and prices of cement (#425 common sulfate cement)  and gasoline (90 octane) in Chengdu reached 650 and 4,900 yuan  per ton respectively. As of the end of February, the price per  ton of various kinds of steel used in urban construction stood  at between 3,300 and 3,700 yuan per ton.    The energy "bottleneck" eased somewhat, relatively speaking.  Nevertheless, the energy production and investment situation was  very gloomy. During the first half of the year, electricity  shortages occurred in varying degrees in many places.  <H5>  Blow Away the Bubbles To See the Growth </H5>   Despite the ensuing marked inflation and "bottlenecks," and  despite the appearance of a bubble economy in many places, such  as too many and too indiscriminate development zones, and  overheating of real estate, the high economic growth for 1992  and the first half of 1993 made an enormous contribution to  China's economic development, and effective growth was still  paramount.    Clear evidence of this was that the economy's high speed  growth kept within bounds the trend toward a continued slide in  enterprises' economic returns of the previous several years.  This enabled a month-by-month turn for the better.    During the first half of the year, the composite index of  industrial economy performance for the whole country (statistics  not yet available for Shanghai and Tibet) was 99.31, up 15.67  points from the same period in 1992. Of the six leading  indicators, except for net output value, those for product sales  rate, profit and tax rate on capital, profit rate on costs,  capital turnover times, and net output value labor productivity  rate were tremendously higher than for the same period in 1992.  Production and sales paced each other fairly well, and funds  turned over rapidly. The industrial product sales rate figured  at prevailing prices increased with each passing month. Thanks  to the good dovetailing of production with sales and the speed  up in the number of times that industrial working capital turned  over, the amount of finished goods in inventory decreased. The  fairly rapid increase in profits and tax payments meant a  reduction in the number of money-losing firms. As of the end of  June, 17.6 percent of all industrial enterprises showed a loss.  This was a 1.7 percentage point decline from the same period in  1992.    Overall, with the high speed operation of the economy, total  industrial economic returns approached the average level of the  Seventh Five-Year Plan. If the returns of Shanghai's industrial  economy are figured in, the total exceeded that of the Seventh  Five-Year Plan. By comparison, with the sustained decline in  economic returns during the period of improving the economic  environment and rectifying the economic order, it is easy to see  that the economy's high growth undeniably increased national  economic strength.  <H3>  Middle Phase: Soft Landing, Major Readjustment of  Macroeconomic Policy </H3>   Just when the whole country, and even the whole world, was  regarding China's economy with alarm and wondering where this  "express train" was headed, China's macroeconomic policy  underwent a major change:    On 15 May, the Chinese People's Bank announced a raise in  the  interest rate on bank savings deposits, the interest rate on  savings rising an average 1.19 percentage points, and the  interest rate on loans rising an average 0.82 percentage points.  This was the first change in bank interest rates in two years.  Next, the State Council inaugurated a series of emergency  measures such as raising the interest rate on savings and loans,  tightening the money supply, rectifying the financial order,  putting development zones on a tight leash, taking drastic  action to control real estate overheating, and reducing fiscal  expenditures.    The inauguration of this series of macroeconomic regulation  and control measures was an inevitable reaction of the central  policy makers to the marked overheating of the economy. However,  this macroeconomic regulation and control differed from the  improvement of the economic environment and rectification of the  economic order in 1989. Central Committee leaders reiterated  under numerous important circumstances that the increase in  macroeconomic regulation and control was not an across-the-board  tightening. Its purpose was to control economic overheating and  to protect both economic growth and the impetus of reform. In  economic parlance, this regulation and control approach was a  "soft landing."    General Slowing of the Economy During July    Inauguration of the Central Committee's macroeconomic  regulation and control policies in May had a marked effect very  rapidly on real estate, stocks, and development zones. Liaoning,  Hebei, Shandong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, Guangdong, and  Guangxi conducted a one-time check of development zones at the  county level and above. As a result, the number of development  zones in these six provinces and one autonomous region decreased  from more than 1,200 to more than 200, the plan area contracting  from more than 7,500 to 1,600 square kilometers. Real estate in  all the jurisdictions slumped and land prices plummeted.    However, the macroeconomic regulation and control had no  immediate effect on industrial production. In June, industrial  growth nationwide reached a record breaking 30 percent. A  questionnaire survey of the prosperity of 5,000 industrial  concerns in 12 provinces that the departments concerned  conducted showed that these 5,000 concerns maintained the rising  momentum of the second quarter after entering the third quarter.  However, 75 percent of the concerns did feel a shortage of  working capital, the working capital situation reaching the  lowest point in recent years.    The effect of macroeconomic regulation and control on  industrial production began in mid-July. The 19 August State  Statistical Bureau report on the economy during July said that  industrial concerns at the township level and above throughout  the country showed an output value of 286.3 billion yuan for  July, up 25.1 percent over the same period in 1992. This was a  5.1 percentage point downturn from June, and marked the first  time in more than 30 months that the State Statistical Bureau  reported a substantial downturn in industrial growth. In  addition, investment in fixed assets for newly opened projects  declined; buying and selling of means of production slowed; and  trading volume dropped.    It was inland and state-owned enterprises that were most  quickly and hardest hit by this macroeconomic readjustment and  control.    In terms of ownership, the July output value of state-owned,  collective, and township-operated and other kinds of industries  was 8.7, 43.4, and 70.3 percent of the total, the  township-operated and other kinds of industries still  maintaining high speed growth. By comparison with June,  state-owned, collective, township-operated, and other kinds of  industries showed a downturn in industrial growth of 4, 7.2, 7,  and 1.2 percentage points respectively. The downturn in  industries under other forms of ownership was least, showing the  aptness of the macroeconomic regulation and control policy to be  very great.    In terms of region, southeast coastal area maintain growth  leadership. Except for Shanghai, Hainan, and Xinjiang, growth  decline in varying degrees in every region. Places having a  growth higher than the national average in July were Jiangsu,  Zhejiang, Anhui, Fujian, Shandong, Guangdong, and Hainan  provinces. In the eastern, central and western parts of the  country, gross industrial output value increased in July by  30.1, 17.3, and 13.7 percent. During July, growth of industrial  production took a downturn in 26 provinces, municipalities, and  autonomous regions, the area of greatest downturn being  concentrated mostly in the central and western regions. The  downturn was fairly slight in coastal areas such as Guangdong,  Hainan, and Shanghai    Regulation and Control Measures Largely in Place by  September    If one says that people saw only a little evidence of  macroeconomic regulation and control in September, by October,  following the central government's inauguration of macroeconomic  regulation and control measures, the general effect of the soft  landing of China's economy had become apparent.    From the beginning of the third quarter, growth of  industrial  production took a downturn, but still maintained a pattern of  fairly rapid growth. After reaching a peak of 30.2 percent in  June, growth of industrial production at the township level and  above began a month-by-month downturn. During the third quarter,  growth was 22.6 percent, including 19.1 percent for September.  During October, growth of industrial production continue a  descent. In November, it was 18.9 percent. The total figure for  January through November was 22.7 percent.    The overly rapid increase in investment in fixed assets was  brought under control. State-owned units investment growth  declined from 70.7 percent for the first half of the year to  61.7 percent during the third quarter. This included a 56.5  percent rate for September. During October, investment continued  to cool, investment by state-owned units in fixed assets for  that month increasing 58.4 percent. Total growth for the period  January through October was 65.2 percent.    Markets stable while prospering. With the entry into the  third quarter, the buying up of consumer goods as a hedge  against currency value loss abated, and group consumption  inflation was brought under control. Social commodity retail  sales totaled 968.7 billion yuan for the first through the third  quarters, up 22.4 percent from the same period in 1992. After  deducting for price rises, the actual increase was 9.3 percent.  In November, social commodity retail sales increased 19.8  percent.    Means of production markets cooled greatly, the increase in  sales declining from the 49.5 percent of the first half of the  year to 27.3 percent in the third quarter. Speculative buying  and selling weakened markedly, and the shortage of means of  production eased. Prices fell. Prices of finished steel used in  construction fell from 4,100 yuan per ton in June to 3,050 yuan  per ton in September.    The finance and banking, and the fiscal and tax sectors  turned for the better. Uncontrolled lending, uncontrolled fund  raising, uncontrolled establishment of financial institutions  were brought under control. Individual savings mounted month by  month. As of the end of September, savings accounts contained a  balance of 1.3867 trilling yuan, 232.2 billion yuan more than at  the end of 1992.    Stock markets, futures markets, foreign exchange markets,  the  real estate market, and development zones all turned for the  better. Investment in commercial housing turned downward. Real  estate prices in coastal areas declined about 20 percent.  Development of futures markets and stock markets gradually  stabilized. The foreign exchange swap market rate for the  renminbi stabilized at 8 yuan to $1.00. About 8 yuan is a  rather reasonable price.    All in all, thanks to the strong macroeconomic regulation  and  control from May through August, positive changes appeared in  the operation of the economy. The macroeconomic environment was  relatively stable, and "bottlenecks," which are one of two signs  of economic overheating, eased markedly. The rise in prices also  receded slightly. September macroeconomic monitoring and early  warning indicators showed that the economic situation had  receded from the middle of the "red light zone" (i.e.,  overheating) of the first half of the year to the lower end of  the "red light zone."    Intensity: From Strengthening to Fine Tuning    Because of the difficulty in getting the intensity of  retrenchment just right, some negative results accompanied the  macroeconomic regulation and control process, principal of which  was a general shortage of funds in enterprises because of the  tightening of the money supply. Although the shortage of funds  in enterprises only began to appear in April 1993, by the middle  of July, it suddenly intensified. Triangular debt reappeared,  and with much greater force than previously. In some  enterprises, sales slackened, inventories rose, and enterprises  delayed paying each other. As of the end of July, net accounts  receivable of industries within budget nationwide totaled 173.4  billion yuan, up 24.8 billion from the same period in 1992. Some  concerns that showed good returns amd that were developing at  moderate speed during the first half of the year saw a sudden  slide in production and returns during the second half of the  year because of the funds shortage. Some experts said that  without some moderation of the intensity of regulation and  control, the landing would be hard rather than soft.    The negative effects that grew out of this macroeconomic  regulation and control were attributable, to a very large  extent, to China's finance and banking system. China's banks are  neither like banks that operate for policy reasons nor like  commercial banks. They have the authority of banks that operate  for policy reasons, and they are strongly mindful of their own  economic interests. Under these circumstances, it is very  difficult to regulate and control the economy effectively in an  appropriate way. During the financial consolidation, the central  government asked the banks to straighten out their loans, and  they asked the banks to recall the 90 billion yuan they had  invested in real estate. In fact, however, this 90 billion yuan  had been buried in the ground and could not be easily taken  back. What was to be done? Restricting normal credit was all  that could be done. Enterprises everywhere had a strong reaction  to this action by the banks.    After discovering this problem, the central government  immediately reduced the intensity of regulation and control, and  infused some money with the result that enterprises' money  supply began to improve during October. In October, banks and  credit cooperatives issued 71.2 billion yuan in new credit, 27.4  billion yuan more than during the same month in 1992. Seventy  percent of it was credit to be used as working capital. With the  moderate easing of the money supply, enterprises' savings  reversed the several month sustained decline. Enterprises made  new deposits of 24.7 billion yuan during the month, 2.4 billion  more than during the same month in 1992, thereby showing an  increase in enterprises ability to pay. Currency issuance  continued to be effectively controlled, 8.8 billion yuan less  put into circulation during October than during the same month  in 1992. The specialized banks' payment reserves rate climbed to  around 10 percent thereby changing the payment difficulty  situation.  <H3>  Final Phase: High Growth a Foregone Conclusion, Three  Problems Require Solution </H3>   Despite the easing of the speed of economic growth during  the  last half of the year, because of the ultrahigh speed growth of  the first half of the year, speed of economic growth for the  year as a whole will still be high in 1993.    According to State Statistical Bureau statistics, GNP for  the  year will break the 3 trillion yuan mark. Figured at comparable  prices, this is an approximately 13 percent increase over 1992.  Other major economic indicators are as follows:    Industry Gross output value of industry at the  township level and above will be about 21 percent greater than  in 1992. If village level and above industry is included, the  increase will be about 23 percent.    Agriculture Forecasts call for the gross output of  grain to maintain the 885 billion jin level of 1992., the gross  output value of agriculture for the year increasing 4 percent  over 1992.    Investment Investment in social fixed assets for  the year will total 1.15 trillion yuan in an approximately 46  percent increase over 1992, making this the highest investment  growth year since the 1980s.    Markets Social commodity retail sales for the year  will total 1.35 trillion yuan in an approximately 23 percent  increase over 1992. After deducting for price rises, the actual  increase will be about 9 percent.    Foreign Trade Exports for the year will total  between $90 billion and $93 billion, up 6 to 8 percent over  1992. Total imports will break the $100 billion mark, up more  than 24 percent.    However, simultaneous with the sustained high growth of the  economy as a whole and the achievements made in macroeconomic  regulation and control, several glaring problems appeared in the  operation of the economy during 1993 that will require solution  during practice in the future.    Speed and Health: How To Combine the Two    The high economic growth of the first half of 1993, and the  macroeconomic regulation and control process during the last  half of the year confronted us with an extremely acute problem:  how to make economic development both speedy and healthy.    During the past several years, the economic development  policy of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council has  been "sustained, steady, and coordinated." The Third Plenary  Session of the 13th Party Central Committee changed this,  proposing a "sustained, speedy, and healthy" policy. This policy  adjustment was necessary because China's economy needs high  speed. China's economy is facing enormous international  challenges. If China is to become a world economic power in the  twenty-first century, slow speed economic development will not  do, and medium speed development will not do either. Only  sustained high speed development can make up for China's being a  late comer, and establish an invincible position for China in  international competition.    However, attaining sustained, rapid, and healthy development  is by no means easy. Since 1978, China's economy has gone  through three major fluctuations, namely between 1978 and 1982,  between 1983 and 1986, and between 1987 and 1991. The process in  each fluctuation was rapid economic development leading to  economic overheating, and culminating in urgent retrenchment.  This means that for the past more than a decade, China's economy  has been unable to escape from a cycle of overheating once  restraints are removed and ruin when restraints are reimposed.  This includes the economic heating of 1988 and the economic  slide of 1989, which are still fresh in people's memories. The  high economic growth of 1992 and 1993 are likewise confronting  an overheating threat. The macroeconomic regulation and control  of the last half of the year was also undertaken because no  alternative existed. Mindful of the lessons of past economic  retrenchments, the approach that the Central Committee took this  time in increasing macroeconomic regulation and control was a  soft landing. Nevertheless, in the regulation and control  process, a severe shortage of enterprise funds appeared, and  production faced a difficult period of slippage; thus, large  amounts of money had to be provided. Seemingly, the attainment  of both rapid and healthy development is a major problem that  China will have to solve in the future.  <H5>  Prices: A Wild Horse That Has Not Yet Been Broken </H5>   While the overheated economy was beginning to cool during  the  last half of the year, skyrocketing prices had yet to be brought  under effective control. The price index remained high with no  sign of coming down. State Statistical Bureau statistics showed  an average 12 percent rise in retail prices for the first three  quarters, and a 14 percent rise in the cost of living. This  included an 18.9 percent rise in 35 large- and medium-sized  cities. In October, the rise in prices still showed some  resilience, the cost of living index in 35 large- and  medium-sized cities increasing to 21.1 percent.    The continuation of prices at a fairly high level was  attributable to the following several factors: First, the cost  of living index is a lagging indicator. Even though the economy  is cooling now, the lag effect of the previous phase of economic  overheating still plays a role on consumer prices. This is to  say that during the ultrahigh speed economic development period  of 1992 and the first half of 1993, prices of the means of  production rose rapidly because of the effect of too vigorous  demand. This caused a rise in consumer goods production costs.  There is a lag period between the rise in prices of means of  production and the rise in prices of consumer goods. Second,  during 1993, the state substantially readjusted or decontrolled  prices of numerous daily necessities and services, such as the  prices paid for grain, nonstaple foods, fuel, house rent and  electricity, transportation, and school expenses. Prices of  these essentials rose considerably. Since no substitutes could  be found following the rise in prices of these essentials, the  cost of living rose without let up. Third, as income levels  rose, consumer goods of different qualities gradually appeared.  The high consumption of people having high incomes propelled a  rise in prices of consumer goods. Fourth, changes in the  renminbi-U.S. dollar exchange rate caused prices of imported  consumer goods to shoot up. This also abetted the rise in prices  of consumer goods.    Given China's present economic system, complete elimination  of inflation during the near term is impossible. Nor is it  necessary. The key lies in getting the citizenry and other  quarters to accept it. The emphasis of macroeconomic regulation  and control has to be on holding the rise in prices below 10  percent. The current extent of price rises is clearly too high.  By increasing the intensity of macroeconomic regulation and  control, and halting the inauguration of new price reform  measures, skyrocketing prices may be brought under control.  However, speed of economic growth may be too low, and plans for  further deregulation of the prices of products of some basic  industries in 1994 will come to naught. If prices continue to  rise beyond controllable limits, the direction of macroeconomic  regulation and control can be changed, financial controls  relaxed, but this would mean that the as yet not fully cooled  economy would face more overheating. Clearly, unless there is a  marked price recession in early 1994, a timely change in  policies to influence subsequent macroeconomic regulation and  control will be necessary.  <H5>  Quick Returns: When Will a Change Occur? </H5>   Yet another problem is the conflict between speed and  returns. Returns from China's industrial economy are  characterized by quick returns. This was particularly so during  1993. As the speed of economic growth changed, economic returns  from industry nationwide were strikingly different during the  first half and the second half of the year. The composite index  for returns from the industrial economy nationwide (no  statistics available from Shanghai) for the first six months of  the year was 99.31. This was 15.67 points higher than for the  same period in 1992. If the statistics for Shanghai are  included, the national economic returns composite index is more  than 100. As the speed of economic growth began a downturn in  June, the economic returns of industrial firms also began a  gradual descent. Statistics from 360,000 independently  accounting industrial concerns at the township level and above  throughout the country showed a composite index for industrial  economy returns of 98.67 for the period January through July,  96.63 for the period January through August, 96.34 for the  period January through September, and 95.21 for the period  January through October. This represented a respective 0.64,  2.68, 2.97, and 4.10 percentage point decline from the January  through June 99.31 economic return composite index. It included  a marked decline for light and heavy industry. Twenty-five of  the country's 29 regions (not including Tibet) were affected.    The direct reasons for the decline in returns of the  industrial economy over such a wide area were, first, the  accumulation of goods in inventory and payment defaults, which  caused a decline in the money utilization rate. Second was a  rise in enterprise losses. A more deep-seated reason was that  once quick return industries encountered a cooling of the  economy, their production cycles did not work well, leading to a  decline in economic returns.    So-called quick returns means nonintensive economic returns.  Specifically, quick return industries may be generally  characterized as follows: First, their product make-up is  ill-conceived; second, product quality is rather poor; and  third, their management and technology is antiquated, their  labor productivity rate is low, their energy and materials  utilization rate is low, and waste is great. Since they are  innately inferior, the ratio between input and effective output  of such industries is low, and consumption per unit of product  produced is high. When the economy is developing rapidly, large  social demand makes the sale of their products easy. Even though  consumption per unit of product produced is high, such concerns  can manage because of their quick economic returns. However,  once social demand shrinks absolutely, or growth declines, sales  become difficult because of the high cost of producing products,  and the level of economic returns decline as well.    During the period of a country's economic takeoff, quick  return industries are an inevitable phase. They also make a  contribution to high speed development of the economy. However,  if no change is made in quick returns, macroeconomic policy is  likely to end up in two predicaments: Too high a speed means  proneness to overheating; too low a speed means a great decline  in economic returns may occur. Such a situation occurred once  during 1989, and it has appeared again in 1993. Therefore, both  macroeconomic policymakers and the operators of concerns should  see quick returns for what they are. They should not be overly  optimistic about the temporary great increase in quick returns.  They must take actions to reduce, insofar as possible, the  period of quick returns.</p>

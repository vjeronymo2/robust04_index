			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / Georgia arrest over shooting Georgian authorities said yesterday they had arrested a man accused of shooting US diplomat Fred Woodruff earlier this month, but described the envoy's death as a 'chance killing', Reuter reports from Tbilisi. Mr Woodruff, reported to be working for the CIA, was killed while travelling in a car with Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze's security chief. A government official said the suspect had apparently fired in an attempt to stop the car, but had not intended to kill anyone.</p>

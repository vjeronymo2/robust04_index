			<p><P> August 15, 1990, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P>  Sparkler Dumping Charges to be Probed: The U.S. government has agreed to  investigate charges that imported Chinese sparklers are being sold in the  United States at less that fair value.  </P> <P> The International Trade Commission ruled 4-0 that there is reason to believe  the Chinese imports threaten material damage to the domestic sparkler industry.  That means the Commerce Department will open an anti-dumping investigation,  with preliminary findings due by Dec. 10. Government figures show that starting  in 1988, Chinese sparklers captured more than half of the U.S. market.  </P></p>

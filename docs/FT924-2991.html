			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / Fuel for the fire in Moslem hearts: Stefan Wagstyl on frustrations ignited by the assault on Ayodhya SYED Abdullah Bukhari, the imam of Delhi's largest mosque and the white-bearded patriarch of India's Moslems, sympathises with those Moslems who have taken to the streets in violent protest throughout India in reaction to the assault on the mosque in Ayodhya. 'They have fire in their chests,' he said yesterday. 'The destruction of a mosque is like killing a human being. They are right to be angry.' The imam also approved of the actions of his 40-year-old son and potential successor, Syed Ahmed Bukhari, who had just been arrested for the second time in two days for trying to lead a protest march to the prime minister's home in defiance of a police curfew. Ayodhya has stirred the passions of Indian Moslems more than anything since hundreds of thousands of people died in the riots which accompanied partition in 1947. At least 700 people have died since the mosque was destroyed on Sunday - most of them Moslems killed by police fire. Moslems are angry not just with the Hindu militants who pulled down the 16th century shrine but with the government for allowing the destruction to happen. 'This is the greatest disaster India's Moslems have faced,' says Mr Ebrahim Suleiman Sait, president of the India Union Moslem League, the leading Moslem political organisation. Anger is one thing. Action is another. Moslems have taken to the streets in the past - as recently as two years ago a partial assault on the Ayodhya mosque also prompted nationwide riots. But violence has rarely brought India's Moslems any benefits because it has rarely been followed by any concrete political action. For a community of 120m people, some 13 per cent of the population, India's Moslems have been singularly unable to assert themselves. Mr M J Akbar, a leading Moslem journalist and a former MP, says he would like to think that Ayodhya might be a big enough shock to provoke Moslems into sustained political action. But he doubts it. 'India's Moslems have a ghetto mentality.' It is not hard to find the causes of Moslems' political failure or their frustration. Hardly any large enterprises are in Moslem hands. Moslems account for less than 2 per cent of those passing senior civil service exams and only about 2 per cent of bank executives. Moslem literacy rates are officially estimated to be around 42 per cent, against a national figure of 52 per cent, though some Moslem educationalists put the Moslem figure as low as 25 per cent. Moreover, burdened by poverty and ignorance, Moslems have been unable to resolve their basic dilemma - how far they want to compete in mainstream Indian life and how much they want to assert a separate identity. Many Moslems believe the roots of their weaknesses go back to the partition when the cream of India's Moslems fled to Pakistan, including most of the political leadership. Those who stayed behind learnt through the bloody partition riots to keep their heads down. Moslems claim they suffer discrimination from the Hindu majority, in particular in schools and at work. But they also acknowledge that they are themselves partly to blame for what is probably their biggest weakness - the lack of education. Moslem clerics have been slow to promote schooling, except for Islamic studies, and especially for girls. In the large cities, life is slowly changing for those Moslems who have been able to secure middle-class jobs. Some have managed to get rich by working in the Gulf states on contracts. They and their children are able to enter mainstream Indian life - sometimes to the disgust of more traditional Moslems. But for the majority, poverty is the rule. As Mr Akbar says: 'The fundamental problem is the lack a strong Moslem middle class.' Without such a force, Moslems' role in politics will necessarily be limited. Until the late 1970s, Moslems generally supported the ruling Congress (I) party, mainly because it was in power. Moslems were guaranteed some important privileges - such as the right to enforce Moslem family law. However, in the 1980s, Moslems drifted in increasing disillusionment to middle-of-the-road secularist parties, such as Janata Dal. This helped to open the way for the militant Hindu Bharatiya Janata Party, which spearheaded the movement against the Ayodhya mosque. The BJP won a string of electoral successes in the late 1980s. Until last weekend, Moslems were steadily drifting back to Congress (I). Whether their anger at the government's failure to prevent the mosque's destruction will overcome their fear of further BJP gains is hard to say. Either way, Moslems will be unable to assert themselves at the ballot box. So it is scarcely surprising that their young men riot in the streets. And that even as moderate a man as Syed Abdullah Bukhari refuses to condemn them.</p>

			<p><P> November 29, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DISNEY PLANS A MAINSTREAM RECORD LABEL;  </P> <P> ENTERTAINMENT: THE FIRM SAYS IT WILL START FROM SCRATCH BECAUSE MERGERS HAVE  PUSHED ACQUISITION PRICES OUT OF SIGHT.  </P> <P> In a widely expected move, Walt Disney Co. announced Tuesday that it will wade  into "the mainstream" of the recorded music business by starting a new label to  be run by Peter T. Paterno, an industry lawyer who has represented heavy metal  acts.  </P> <P> Disney -- which already owns the largest children's music company in the world  -- recently told Wall Street analysts that it would enter the industry's  mainstream, and Paterno told The Times last month that discussions about his  hiring were under way.  </P> <P> In a prepared release, Disney Chairman Michael D. Eisner said the company  elected to start from scratch because a wave of mergers "has driven the cost of  record company acquisitions beyond feasibility."  </P> <P> The name tentatively selected for the new unit is Hollywood Records, the  company said.  </P> <P> Some industry executives have questioned whether image-conscious Disney has the  stomach for hard-rock albums, which have drawn fire from pulpits and Capitol  Hill, but Disney has apparently given its answer with the hiring of Paterno as  president of the division. His clients include Metallica (a band that delivers  with "fury," according to one reviewer) and Guns N' Roses, which became a  phenomenon several years ago with its "Appetite for Destruction" album.  </P> <P> A start-up operation is "difficult, but they've always been in the record  business," said Gordon Crawford, a senior vice president of Capital Research  Co. who specializes in entertainment stocks. "I don't doubt their abilities to  do much of anything," Crawford continued, praising the Eisner-led management.  "Since taking over the company, they've done everything right."  </P> <P> Eisner told a news service that he expects the launch to cost less than one  motion picture movie, which averages about $18 million these days, but the  costs could be even lower. Warner recently reached an agreement to spend $50  million to $60 million over five years to launch a new record operation with  former MCA Records chief Irving Azoff, an industry source said.  </P></p>

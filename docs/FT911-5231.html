			<p>910415 FT  15 APR 91 / Kinnock claims Labour is champion of 'opportunity' MR Neil Kinnock yesterday outlined Labour's claim to be the true champion of an 'opportunity society', accusing the Tories of having cynically dreamed up the slogan as a general-election winner. In a wide-ranging BBC Radio 4 interview, the Labour leader said the government had had 12 years to prove its credentials, but had instead squandered Pounds 100bn in oil revenues while eroding social services. Party officials said last night that they had intercepted Tory plans to entitle the Conservative manifesto document Opportunity Society and would undermine them with a prior claim to authorship of the concept. Today Labour's national executive committee will endorse the party's final pre-election policy document, called Opportunity Britain, from which its election manifesto will be drawn. The paper puts heavy emphasis on consumers' rights in goods and services in the public and private sectors. It stresses the importance of training to raise employee capabilities and improve Britain's competitive position in international markets. Tonight Mr Gordon Brown, Labour's trade and industry spokesman, will use a speech in Brighton to launch an attack on the Tory government's record as an 'enabling' administration, on the eve of the formal publication of Labour's 27,000-word paper. Challenged in his interview to demonstrate differences between the two parties' 'opportunity' policies, a relaxed Mr Kinnock said the critical factor was: 'We mean it and they don't' He went on to add: 'If there is an idea associated with me in particular it is the idea of opportunity, of nourishing people's capabilities, of seeing they are properly cared for by means of the collective resources of the community.' By ensuring people are capable of 'growing in stature' they could then make their own contribution to the community. He cited Labour's new programmes for training as an example of policies of fostering opportunities. The Labour leader also highlighted promises to distribute funds for City Technology Colleges to all schools. Other new commitments in Labour's document will include a scheme to make employers provide higher-quality training. The document links educational and training issues for people aged 16 to 19 with its promise of broader opportunities, as a key component in boosting UK manufacturing capabilities. It argues for vocational qualifications to be given equal status to academic ones, another move aimed at stealing a march on the Tory manifesto. Labour's other main strategy thrust to be developed this week centres on promoting its policy for active intervention to help manufacturing industry. Mr Kinnock was careful yesterday also to emphasise his party's determination to control public spending.</p>

			<p><P> November 27, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BISHOP BARS RITE FOR KILLEA  </P> <P> As a 33-year-resident of San Diego, I am incensed with the public attack by  Bishop Leo T. Maher against Killea. As someone who also follows politics on all  levels with regularity (developing an admitted cynicism in the process), Killea  has a reputation for integrity and responsiveness to her constituents over many  years of service. For Maher to impose a religious penalty on this woman because  of her longstanding position on freedom of choice smacks of "hierarchical  institutional" arrogance, to say nothing about contempt for deeply held  convictions about the traditional separation of church and state in this  nation.  </P> <P> NICKY KRONICK  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

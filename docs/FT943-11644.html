			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / Water review aims for a three-way balance As Mr Ian Byatt, the water industry regulator, made clear yesterday, his price review was not only about defusing the row over soaring household water bills. He had to ensure that the water companies have enough money to finance the huge clean-up required by EU directives and pay adequate dividends to shareholders. His new K-factors, limiting price increases to 1 percentage point a year above inflation for 10 years, are supposed to strike a three-way balance between these considerations. Judging by the mixed reaction yesterday they were a partial success. Consumers were disappointed that prices will still go up. Environmentalists said there will not be enough money to clean up beaches and rivers. Some water companies accepted the new price controls, but one will appeal. The stock market heaved a sigh of relief and marked up shares, but that was only because dealers had discounted them in anticipation of the worst. The review's main outcome - a prediction that water prices will rise by just under 1 per cent a year in real terms over the next 10 years - is certainly a big improvement on recent increases, which have averaged 5 per cent and caused storms of protest. But it falls short of Mr Byatt's statement last year that consumers did not see why water bills should rise faster than inflation. The consumer viewpoint was summed up by the National Consumer Council, which only a fortnight ago published a scathing attack on the returns reaped by water company shareholders at consumers' expense. It said: 'The fact that prices will go up less than otherwise is obviously good news. But they will continue to rise faster than inflation.' There is a limit, however, to how far Mr Byatt could go in limiting price rises. Although he can shift more investment costs from consumers and to the water companies themselves, his first statutory duty is to ensure that the water industry can finance its environmental obligations. But he did not satisfy the opposition parties, which accused him of being soft on the companies - and on generous salaries for chairmen. Mr Chris Smith, Labour's spokesman on environmental protection, said the review had failed to stop water companies loading most of the costs of long-term investment on current consumers. He said: 'Mr Byatt has said in the past that the water companies could borrow much more - at preferential rates - to finance essential long-term improvements. But here he has completely ducked the issue.' The reaction in the water industry ranged from cautious to grudging, although this disguised a sense of relief that the new limits are not as tough as many had feared. The fact that only one company - South West Water, which faces especially large investment demand - will challenge its new price limits is probably the most palpable evidence that Mr Byatt has presented the industry with a price regime it can live with - and certainly an easier one than he proposed in his opening discussions. Mr Mike Taylor, finance director of Northumbrian Water, said: 'I think he struck a hard bargain with everybody, but got a little soft at the end. Mr Mike Swallow, director of the Water Companies' Association, the trade group, said some of his members 'have come to an initial view that (the K-factors) are tough but succeed in striking a balance between the interests of customers and shareholders'. This was also the view in the City, where analysts believed that the new K-factors would not seriously inhibit the industry's financial position, or its ability to pay sizeable real increases in annual dividends. Mr Lakis Athanasiou, a UBS analyst, said: 'There's a price for everything. He could have been tighter and not given problems, but you probably would have had a few more companies going to the MMC.' Much of the pressure of tighter controls will have to be absorbed by greater efficiency in the water industry. So the challenge now will be on management to meet its investment obligations, and still have enough to keep shareholders contented. Mr Byatt thinks the industry can manage this, and analysts calculate that there is enough fat to keep interest and dividend cover at healthy levels. Even so, Mr Byatt expects that the rate of return on water-company assets will more than halve from last year's 13 per cent to about 6 per cent over the 10 years covered. Even though Mr Byatt expects investment and other factors to add Pounds 47 to the typical household water bill by 2005, he expects tighter returns and operating expenditure to cut that by Pounds 24, bringing the increase down to Pounds 23. But although Mr Byatt stressed that 'profits will be lower' he declined to go into any detail. The level of profit companies earned and the dividends they paid were a matter for company boards and management. Nor was he willing to speculate whether his K-factors would help rein in chairmen's salaries. MAIN POINTS Water prices to rise by annual average of 0.9 percentage points over inflation from 1995-2005. Average increase in household water bills to be Pounds 23 by 200, with wide regional variations. Household connection costs to be Pounds 200 next year. 10-year investment programme of Pounds 24bn Companies' rates of return to halve in 10 years</p>

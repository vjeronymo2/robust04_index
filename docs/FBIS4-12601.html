			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by political correspondent Aluf Ben] </F>   [Excerpt] Israel has completed a comprehensive study on the  demarcation of the Israeli-Jordanian border to be used as a  basis in the negotiations with Jordan. The document analyzes  the problems with the demarcation of the border, which runs from  Hammat Gader in the north to Elat in the south, through the  Jordan and al-Yarmukh Rivers and the 'Arava. The  Israeli-Jordanian border has never been demarcated by mutual  consent, either on maps on in the field. Its current  configuration is based on general descriptions dating back to  the time of the British mandate. The joint agenda of the talks  stipulates that the border will be demarcated taking these  descriptions into consideration.    The study depicts numerous problems involved in the  demarcation of the border (which runs through the center of the  Jordan River and the Dead Sea) due to changes in the river flow  and the lake's size, and raises questions such as determining  the sovereignty over small islands in the Jordan River.    Jordan has various claims from Israel concerning the  borders,  first and foremost, to get back areas in the 'Arava occupied by  Israel after the Six-Day War. Jordan has been pressuring Israel  to discuss the demarcation of the border, posing it as a  condition for progress in the peace talks. Jordan has not yet  submitted a detailed account of its demands in the framework of  the Washington talks.    A debate about joint development projects in the 'Arava is  scheduled to be held in the next meeting of the joint Israeli-  Jordanian-U.S. economic committee. Although Israel and Jordan  have been discussing joint projects, the Jordanians demand to  discuss the demarcation of the border first, because those  projects are slated for the border area.    Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin has instructed the Israeli  delegation to the talks with Jordan not to discuss the border  issue before the Jordanians agree to engage in serious  discussions on the formulation of a peace treaty between the two  countries.

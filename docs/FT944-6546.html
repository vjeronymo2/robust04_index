			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / Bayer seeks less crowded sectors Bayer, the German chemicals multinational, is to re-focus its pharmaceuticals research away from crowded market sectors and step up spending on the hunt for treatments for allergies, rheumatic ailments and Alzheimer's disease, according to Mr Manfred Schneider, group chairman. Budgets for established areas of interest such as heart and circulatory disease therapies would be reduced in favour of those offering greater possibilities for discovering and exploiting innovative drugs, he said. Reporting a 32 per cent increase in pre-tax profits for the first nine months of the current year, forecasting full-year earnings up from DM2.4bn to DM3.2bn (Pounds 1.3bn), and hinting of an increased dividend, Mr Schneider said he had no plans for any further acquisitions in the pharmaceuticals sector. However, Bayer was in other takeover negotiations and was planning a major co-operative venture. He expected negotiations to be completed during the first quarter of the new year. The group has recently spent DM2.1bn in the US on acquiring ChemDesign, a stake in the Schein generic drugs group and the self-medication business of Sterling Winthrop. Mr Walter Wenninger, the director for pharmaceuticals said the group had six new drugs in the final stages of clinical testing. Although some might not make it to market, they had a combined annual sales potential of up to DM5bn, he said. Among existing products, the antibiotic Ciprobay is expected to turn over more than DM2bn this year. He added that the Adalat high blood-pressure treatment had the potential to reach this level, while Gluxobay, already achieving sales of DM600m, would bring in more than DM1bn once approved in the US. The group as a whole had the potential to increase earnings to more than DM4bn a year within two or three years, Mr Schneider said. Forecasting sales of around DM43bn for the current year, Mr Schneider said he expected foreign markets to grow more than Germany, where sales had risen only 1 per cent in the nine months to the end of September, and now accounted for less than 20 per cent of group turnover.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] National Defense Minister Hugo Estigarribia  Elizeche said he still has not received official confirmation of  the cancellation of the "Strong Roads of the South" operation  that consisted of the entry of 600 servicemen for the  construction of schools, roads, and water wells in San Pedro  Department.    The U.S. answer was officially delivered on 14 February by  U.S. Ambassador Jon Glassman to Paraguayan Foreign Minister Luis  Maria Ramirez Boettner, with whom he met for some 45 minutes.    The U.S. ambassador regretted the fact that U.S. servicemen  were unable to carry out social work in San Pedro Department  because the "Strong Roads" operation was "for the benefit of  Paraguay, however, there is no problem if it does not want the  operation to be carried out; there will be no retaliations nor  ill feelings."    The defense minister said: "I have not been officially  informed yet; I have read the press reports. This seems to be a  decision by the U.S. Government based on Paraguay's proposal.  Well, it may take place some other time."    He added that he did not think the U.S. answer was negative,  taking into account that it was based on terms imposed by  Paraguay for the entry and stay in the country of U.S.  servicemen.    Estigarribia commented: "I do not think it is negative for  Paraguay to establish normal terms for the entry and stay of  foreigners in the country. In other words, it is not wrong to  establish those sorts of requirements."    The minister said: "It is completely normal because it is in  the hands of the party that makes the offer to accept or reject  the terms in a negotiation."    In referring to joint U.S.-Paraguayan military operations  scheduled to take place in 1994, Estigarribia said they are  normal exercises that are carried out every year.    He added: "They are normal operations that take place every  year within the framework of an agreement and accepting all the  terms regarding the entry and stay in the country. I do not  think these operations are going to pose any problems."    The minister explained that the United Forces operations are  carried out with the U.S. Army, while the Unitas operations are  carried out by the Navy.    In the opinion of National Encounter Senator Luis Alberto  Mauro, the terms established by the Paraguayan Government to  allow the entry of U.S. troops into national territory are a  pretext rather than measures to safeguard national sovereignty.    Mauro said the fact that the U.S. servicemen will not come  to  our country represent a victory for General Lino Cesar Oviedo,  "who exerted pressure because the U.S. Government accepted the  participation of the Paraguayan Public Works Ministry rather  than the Army."    The senator added: "I do not think the United States intends  to tread over our sovereignty nor that anybody within the  government seriously believes that these terms are designed to  safeguard sovereignty." He added: "The Paraguayan peoples'  deception represents a victory for Gen. Lino Oviedo because it  was he who convinced [President] Juan Carlos Wasmosy about this."    Mauro insisted: "It is obvious that these requirements are  designed to obstruct and jeopardize the entry of servicemen who  intended to build civilian works. It is only a pretext that has  nothing to do with the zeal to safeguard national sovereignty.  I deeply regret the fact that these civilian works will not be  built because they would greatly benefit the country, and that  the Unitas maneuvers have been authorized at a historical moment  when they are really not justified because there is no  belligerency, no border conflicts at either the international or  regional level. This is a case of opting for weapons instead of  peace, because opting for peace would have meant accepting the  entry of servicemen to build civilian works."</p>

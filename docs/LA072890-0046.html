			<p><P> July 28, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> A PICTURE OF WASTED WATER  </P> <P> Recently you printed a picture of two small children relaxing in a puddle  caused by sprinklers in Van Nuys-Sherman Oaks Park. While I can certainly  appreciate their need to "Cool Off" during our recent heat wave, I would ask  these questions:  </P> <P> Why are the sprinklers on during the heat of the day? Why were they left on  long enough to cause puddles this large? Water is evaporating very quickly in  this heat, but there was still enough to cause puddles.  </P> <P> Why are they watering cement instead of grass?  </P> <P> It seems to me that an extreme amount of water was wasted. This is just one  park out of how many in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Come on Mayor Bradley. If you want to conserve water, maybe you should start  with the government usage. Seems to me if you cut back by 10%, it would be a  major step towards conservation. Only a combined effort will make the  difference.  </P> <P> JUDY PINOS  </P> <P> Sepulveda  </P></p>

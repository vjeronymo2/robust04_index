			<p><P> April 8, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOOD AND COMMON SENSE: HOW TO MAKE THE BEST OF STANDARD HOSPITAL FARE  </P> <P> Probably in no time in your life does food mean less to you than when you're  sick. You may not even feel like eating, or your sense of taste may be thrown  off. But by the same token, people who are laid up in bed sometimes focus more  attention than usual on meals because they have fewer outside distractions.  And, although your appetite might be in hiding, you may need nourishment all  the more when you're ill.  </P> <P> Sound contradictory? Welcome to the looking-glass world of hospital eating,  where it sometimes seems as if nothing goes the way you want or expect it to.  </P> <P> If you've ever done a stint as an in-patient, chances are you've had occasion  to complain about hospital food. Some of our best friends happen to be  nutritionists and dietitians who are trying their best to provide good,  nutritious fare for hospitalized clientele. But our heads would have to be in  the sand not to notice that their valiant efforts don't always meet with  success, especially in the eyes -- or taste buds -- of the patients.  </P> <P> One of the main gripes we hear, of course, is that the food simply does not  taste good. Factoring out the depressing aspect of eating alone in a hospital  room instead of in the comfort of your home, in the bosom of your family, it's  true that institutional food, even at its best, is hard-pressed to match the  quality of meals made in cozier kitchens. So that rap is hard to beat.  </P> <P> A further drawback is that being on a special diet, in conjunction with medical  treatment for an illness, can mean that food choices are limited. That makes  meals still more drab and dull. About half the patients in acute-care hospitals  need special diets for tests or therapy. Sometimes, with time and planning (not  to mention money), restricted menus can be made interesting. But even given  those resources, it's still a challenge.  </P> <P> Many people report that hospital meals are served at strange times. There's a  reason for that: Hospital food services often operate on a two-shift system,  with a skeleton crew on hand in the evenings. Dinner is served early to avoid  having to pay people overtime, part of the ongoing struggle to keep a lid on  costs. Scheduling the evening meal for a more fashionable hour -- say, 7:30 --  in many cases would not be economically feasible.  </P> <P> Another reason why dinner is served early is so that the patient's meal won't  be interrupted if physicians and visitors come in later. Similarly, breakfasts  are frequently served at what seems like a ridiculously early hour, to allow  patients to be ready for their treatments later in the morning. These odd  mealtime hours, over which you have no say, may serve to reinforce the loss of  control many people feel when they enter a hospital.  </P> <P> Then there's the complaint that meals often arrive cold. Again, there is an  explanation. For space and hygienic reasons, hospital kitchens are often  located in isolated parts of the building. Staff try to compensate for the  distance the meal must travel with the use of hot carts and tray insulators.  </P> <P> A confusing aspect of hospital fare is that you're usually required to order  meals a day in advance. By the time the tray appears the next day, you may have  forgotten what it was you ordered -- and you may no longer be in the mood for  it. This is just another inherent disadvantage of institutional food.  </P> <P> However, in this age of computers, we can look forward to the day when the  entire system will be programmed and lag time will be reduced, so that patients  won't have to think ahead in this way.  </P> <P> If you're a patient in a hospital and you find that most of the food is fine,  well and good. But if eating has really become a problem, try to figure out  exactly what is going on. Is it pain, depression, appetite or the food itself?  Discuss the situation as specifically as you can with a nurse or doctor.  Sometimes the problem turns out to be related to the illness.  </P> <P> Another step is to ask to speak to the nutritionist or dietitian. The hospital  team is committed to providing patients with food that is not only  nutritionally sound but that they will enjoy eating. With the doctor's  approval, a diet might be altered to make it more acceptable.  </P> <P> Proper nutrition is important in recovering from illness. So make your feelings  known -- and give the staff a chance to try to meet your needs.  </P></p>

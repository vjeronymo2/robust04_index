			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Kim Ho-sam: "The Shameless Behavior of </F> Splittists"]    [Text] The South Korean puppets are further revealing  their splittist nature. On 6 May traitor Kim Yong-sam appeared  in the site celebrating the so-called workers' day. At the  site, babbling that we are continuing instigation activities  toward the South without renouncing a nuclear development  program and that we are pointing long-range missiles at the  South he clamored that the South Korean people should renounce a  dreamy view on reunification.    On 7 May Yi Hong-ku, minister of the puppet unification  board, held a so-called unification and security policy  coordination meeting. At the meeting he clamored that it will  be inevitable for the UN Security Council to impose sanctions in  case we refuse to accept additional inspections, that stern  countermeasures should be taken, that an international alliance  system will be further strengthened, and the like. He also  urged us to observe the Armistice Agreement, like a thief  turning on their owner, and expressed the will to oppose a new  system for guaranteeing peace that we have proposed recently.    These shameless remarks by traitor Kim Yong-sam and rascal  Yi  Hong-ku which reverse black and white are none other than the  splittists' sophistry which makes the world's people laugh.  Traitor Kim Yong-sam clamored that our missiles are aiming at  them. He carries his distortion of facts too far. Who aims at  whom?    Everyone knows that over 1,000 nuclear weapons deployed in  South Korea today are aimed at our Republic on a continuous  basis. Patriot missiles and Apache attack helicopters which were  introduced from the United States recently are now deployed in  the central frontline sector near the Military Demarcation Line.  At the same time with the deployment of these weapons, U.S.  Defense Secretary Perry came to South Korea and returned home  after reaffirming on the spot the preparedness for attack by  U.S. forces and the South Korean puppet army.    Such being the situation, traitor Kim Yong-sam's behavior is  too shameless. What we cannot but see more seriously is that he  urged the South Korean people to renounce their view on  reunification, babbling that it is a dreamy one. This shows  that traitor Kim Yong-sam's remarks that he would make every  effort to achieve national reconciliation and reunification and  to build a peaceful, reunified fatherland by uniting the divided  fatherland into one are an out- and-out lie. This also shows  that he is not interested in the country's reunification at all.    Traitor Kim Yong-sam is a more vicious splittist and  flunkeyist nation-seller than successive military fascist  dictators.    Next, as soon as he assumed the post of the puppet  unification board, the rascal Yi Hong-ku held a so-called  unification and security policy coordination meeting. At the  meeting he clamored about sanctions against us at the UN  Security Council, the international alliance system, and the  like. Although he is the minister of the board, he completely  revealed that he is a national traitor and splittist who,  regarding the nation as an enemy, is driving the country into  permanent division.    As was already reported on 3 May, answering questions raised  by reporters, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said that proceeding  from our consistent position to show the irreproachability  [kyolbaeksong] of our nuclear activities under the special  position in which we have temporarily suspended the taking  effect of the withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation  Treaty, we have not only decided to conduct the replacement of  fuel rods this time thoroughly under the surveillance of the  International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA], but also immediately  issued entry visas for the five inspection members suggested by  the agency. At the same time, we have made clear that all fuel  rods replaced will be placed under the control of the IAEA and  that measuring them will be permitted at a time when the nuclear  issue is settled in a package deal at DPRK- U.S. talks in the  future.    This is an expression of our Republic's greatest generosity  and sincerity. This is why the broad social opinion of the  world positively appraises this proposal of ours and why it is  urging the United States not to cling to pressure but to  sincerely come to the table of the DPRK-U.S. talks.    This notwithstanding, Yi Hong-ku is still taking a hostile  attitude toward us by clamoring about sanctions, the cooperation  system, and the like. This is indeed an antinational and  antireunification crime.    With regard to Yi Hong-ku's remarks that urged us to observe  the Armistice Agreement while opposing our peace-guaranteeing  proposal, it is not us but the United States and the South  Korean puppets who has violated the Armistice Agreement. The  peace in Korea has been in danger because the United States has  been reinforcing its force of arms in South Korea for more than  40 years since the Armistice Agreement was signed, and because  the South Korean puppets are perpetrating the new war  provocation maneuvers together with the United States.    Meanwhile, the present armistice mechanism can play no role  in preventing a new war on the Korean peninsula at all. This is  why we have put forward a proposal for a new system of  guaranteeing peace. Nevertheless, opposing this proposal, the  puppets are calling for us to observe the Armistice Agreement.  This is indeed a reversed logic.    All facts mentioned above reveal once again that the South  Korean authorities are vicious splittists and bellicose elements  seeking only confrontation and war. These rascals will receive  due stern judgment from our people without fail.</p>

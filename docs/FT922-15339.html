			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / French cable TV industry cuts rates in relaunch FRANCE'S floundering cable television industry is making a desperate attempt to attract more viewers by slashing its subscription rates. The French cable operators, who are struggling to build an audience, have reached agreement with France Telecom, the state-owned telecommunications group that provides the technology for cable, to cut subscription rates by about 15 per cent. The price cutting ploy will form part of a relaunch programme for the whole system. France Telecom has agreed to waive part of the fees it receives from the operators as a cable provider, to meet the cost of the rate reduction. Meanwhile the French government, which was responsible for the launch of France's ambitious plan cable 10 years ago, plans to table legislation to speed up the cabling of apartment blocks in the next session of parliament, which starts this Thursday. When the plan cable was introduced, the government envisaged developing a system with at least 1.25m subscribers by the end of this year. Instead, the cable industry has been bogged down by financial problems and arguments over technology. It has also suffered from fierce competition by Canal Plus, the successful pay-TV channel. As a result it is currently subscribed to by fewer than 700,00 French homes.</p>

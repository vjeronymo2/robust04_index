			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / International Company News: Saudi royal steps in on Circle K reorganisation A SAUDI prince yesterday emerged as the potential backer of one of three reorganisation schemes being put forward for Circle K, the bankrupt US convenience store chain. Commonwealth Oil Refining Company, an oil company based in Arlington, Texas, said that it had received a 'firm written commitment' from Prince Turki bi Fahd bin Jalawi Al Saud to provide Dollars 360m of equity capital towards the financing of a Commonwealth Oil-sponsored plan of reorganisation for Circle K. Commonwealth, which materialised as a potential investor in Circle K in October, added that it would now file with the bankruptcy court an amended proposed plan of reorganisation for the company. It claims that this will offer Circle K's senior creditors around Dollars 350m in cash - slightly more than the company's own reorganisation proposal. Under the amended plan, unsecured creditors would also receive cash, while Commonwealth would emerge as the biggest single shareholder in the reorganised company. The situation at the bankrupt retailer - which is based in Phoenix, Arizona, and continues to operate over 3,000 stores - has been mired in controversy for some months. The company has put forward its own reorganisation plan, which essentially involves selling Circle K for Dollars 399.5m to CK Acquisitions Corp, an international investor group lead by Bahrain-based Investcorp. Investcorp already holds various retail-related interests in the US, including Saks Fifth Avenue, the department store chain. Circle K bondholders oppose the deal, however, and have put forward their own reorganisation scheme. Yesterday, Mr Duncan Darrow, a lawyer with Anderson Kill Olick &amp; Oshinsky, which is acting for the bondholders committee, claimed the bondholders were trying to find a way to join in a fully agreed deal and obtain 'a reasonable recovery'. He suggested that the Commonwealth plan provided bondholders with a 'meaningful recovery', although a spokesman for the law firm added that the bondholders were still pushing their own reorganisation scheme. There was no immediate response from Circle K to the apparent changes in the Commonwealth plan.</p>

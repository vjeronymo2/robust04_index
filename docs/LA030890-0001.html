			<p><P> March 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GENEROUS KITCHEN;  </P> <P> PREPARING A MEAL FOR 25 OR MORE REQUIRES THOROUGH PLANNING AND AN UNDERSTANDING  OF LARGE-SCALE COOKING TECHNIQUES.  </P> <P> Cooking for a crowd has its exhilarating moments, especially when efforts are  rewarded with resounding success. It also has its hazards, as the many cooks  who have tried to increase some recipes by multiplication have realized --  often too late.  </P> <P> One home cook, thinking that the two cups of dry beans called for in the recipe  for six servings was hardly enough for one person, much less the eight people  she was planning to serve, multiplied the recipe by eight. Little did she  realize that beans swell to near triple their size upon cooking. She ended up  having to hire a cleaning crew to sweep up the mess of beans that had expanded  and oozed out of the pot, inching onto the kitchen floor and toward the door, a  ferocious army on the march.  </P> <P> Yes, it does take a knowledge of ingredients, the proper equipment and a sense  of recipe development to be a large-scale cook. Quantity cooking is not just a  matter of multiplying a recipe. Often, expanding a recipe can lead to flavor,  texture and balance problems. Some foods, such as baked goods, jellies, jams  and candies, are particularly fragile in their chemical makeup and require  special formulation to accommodate the chemical changes that occur during  cooking -- even when the recipe is minimally increased.  </P> <P> If you have the equipment, the proper facilities and feel capable of handling  quantity recipes, consider it the better part of valor to follow recipes  already formulated to quantity size amounts. Without the proper equipment and  know-how you are better off sticking to home-size recipes and cooking several  batches.  </P> <P> Readers who write to us about problems related to quantity size cooking are  those who, of necessity, occasionally cook for club or other functions and need  help with recipe ideas and amounts of food to purchase. "I need to plan 100  turkey salad sandwiches in pita pockets and fruit carrot salad but can't  determine the uncooked weight of turkey for 100," wrote Gloria L. Wise of  Rolling Hills Estates.  </P> <P> But organization and recipe development is not the only problem. Another may be  cost.  </P> <P> There are two camps of thought on cost, we found.  </P> <P> One quantity cook opts for roasts in lieu of casseroles. "People don't realize  that by the time they buy all the ingredients and put it all together that they  are probably putting more money into a casserole than it would take to buy and  prepare a simple roast. In addition, most guests prefer roasts with simple side  dishes to fussy casseroles. Besides, you often get a better buy when purchasing  meat in a larger size and doing the cutting yourself," said Times food news  editor Marge Powers.  </P> <P> Roger Starr of Highland Park, on the other hand, is satisfied with one-dish  meals, such as turkey-noodle casserole or meat loaf, which he said work well  when quadrupled and are relatively inexpensive. "Of course, such recipes are  the exception," he wrote. "For one thing my budget is limited to a moderate $3  to $4 per person, paid at the door (and we also serve wine and soft drinks, as  well as hors d'oeuvres and coffee)."  </P> <P> Once a month, Starr is called upon to prepare dinner for anywhere from 40 to 60  members of a social organization to which he belongs. Since he must complete  all preparation and cooking at home in his kitchen and transport the results to  the homes of a revolving series of hosts, he is limited to one-dish meals,  salads and desserts, alternating with the occasional ham or turkey.  </P> <P> This brings us to some of the problems one may encounter and ways of solving  them when cooking for a crowd.  </P> <P> EQUIPMENT -- Check the equipment and utensils available well in advance, then  borrow, rent or purchase any items that are required for preparation of the  meal. Your local church, community center, school, catering establishment or  restaurant may have large utensils they will lend or rent for the occasion. If  you have an opportunity to purchase new equipment for a community kitchen,  suggest that cookware made for restaurants and institutions be used, not  home-size pots and pans. However, be certain that the equipment will fit the  ovens and sinks.  </P> <P> INCREASING RECIPE SIZE -- A good rule of thumb is to multiply a recipe for six  by four times to make 25 servings; by eight to serve 50 and by 16 to serve 100.  Don't attempt to increase recipes for baked goods, candies and jellies.  </P> <P> SEASONING ADJUSTMENT -- When preparing recipes in quantity, seasonings must be  adjusted accordingly. When making two times the recipe, use one and one-half  times the amount of herb or spice called for. When the quantity is three times  the recipe, use two times the amount of herb or spice; when making four times  the recipe, adjust the herb and spice to two and one-half times the amount  called for.  </P> <P> BUYING GUIDE -- Most quantity recipe cooks have trouble deciding how much food  to buy for servings of 25 or more. A Times' guide for quantity food preparation  suggests the amounts of food to buy for 50 servings. Halve the amount for 25  servings. You'll note amounts for seafood, fruit, meats, relishes, salads,  vegetables, beverages, breads, casseroles, dairy products and desserts.  Checking the chart, you will have an instant count for the amount of coffee to  purchase to make 50 one-cup servings. You'll need eight pies to serve 50.  </P> <P> PREPARATION/COOKING TIME -- You'll have to take into account the added  preparation and cooking time needed for quantity recipes to compensate for  cleaning, prepping, drying, or heating large quantities of ingredients. Larger  pans require longer cooking, so the best policy is to follow the recipes to the  letter.  </P> <P>  SPACE -- Storage and refrigerator space is an important factor to consider  when cooking for a crowd. Do you need more than one refrigerator? Do you have  the freezer space for individual molds or casseroles? How about extra shelf or  counter space for properly chilling or cooling dishes. Does your counter have  enough space to lay out several pots and pans at one time? Is your oven large  enough for institutional size equipment?  </P> <P> FOOD SAFETY -- A key consideration in any food handling, especially large  amounts of food that take longer to cool and might be candidates for food  spoilage, is proper cooling. Stuffed poultry, ground meat, egg-containing  products, such as mayonnaise, custard and sauces, could cause problems if  allowed to stand too long at room temperature. Make sure that hot foods being  held are heated to above 140 degrees. You might also want to supplement  existing heating surfaces with the help of electric skillets, steam tables or  hot trays.  </P> <P> All fresh, cured and cooked meat must be kept in the refrigerator and used  within two or three days. Thaw frozen meat just before cooking, preferably in  the refrigerator. Meats cooked for future use should be cooled quickly,  uncovered, in the refrigerator, or in a cool room with good air circulation.  </P> <P> Meat and broth should be separated to hasten cooling. To rapidly cool broth,  set it in a pan of running cold water before refrigeration. Stir the broth to  prevent formation of fat that may seal in heat. Refrigerated coagulated fat can  be removed before reheating to reduce fat content. Leave meat and broth  uncovered until cool. Then cover and refrigerate.  </P> <P> Hot cooked chicken or pieces of meat should be spread out on a flat pan to cool  quickly and safely. Stacked hot meats stand a chance of developing harmful  bacteria if allowed to stand too long. Large roasts may be cut into halves to  cool. Stuffing should be removed from a turkey or other poultry and cooled  separately.  </P> <P> SEASONAL FOODS -- You'll get dollar and quality mileage by buying foods in  season.  </P> <P> A few miscellaneous tips when handling especially fragile foods:  </P> <P>  -- To prevent noodles from sticking together, immerse in cold water until  ready to use. For ease in serving, let lasagna stand 10 minutes before cutting.  Lasagna may be combined ahead of time and refrigerated until ready to bake.  Increase baking time about a half hour.  </P> <P>  -- If making meat balls, combine the ingredients the day before and store  covered in the refrigerator. The sauce can be prepared ahead and refrigerated.  The cooked meat balls and sauce can be stored in the freezer for two months.  </P> <P>  -- To make a gallon of broth using turkey carcass, simmer bones, one cup  chopped onion and one tablespoon salt in one gallon of water for two hours.  </P> <P>  -- When baking cakes, do not place one pan directly below the other in the  oven. For 50 servings, an average recipe will have to be made two times.  </P> <P> THAI CURRY  </P> <P> 3 cups chopped onions  </P> <P> 1/2 cup oil  </P> <P> 1 (4-ounce) can red curry paste  </P> <P> 1/4 cup fish sauce  </P> <P> 3 tablespoons minced fresh ginger root  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon minced garlic  </P> <P> Salt, pepper  </P> <P> 2 (14-ounce) cans coconut milk  </P> <P> 1 quart chicken broth  </P> <P> 9 pounds shrimp, peeled and cleaned, or 6 to 7 pounds lean lamb or beef, cut in  1-inch cubes  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon white pepper or to taste  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons flour  </P> <P> 2 tablespoon water  </P> <P> Hot cooked rice  </P> <P> Diced bananas  </P> <P> Diced mangoes  </P> <P> Diced papaya  </P> <P> Diced passion fruit  </P> <P> Shredded coconut  </P> <P> Peanuts  </P> <P> Saute onions in oil in large skillet until onions are transparent.

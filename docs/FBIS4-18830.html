			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Studio interview with French Cooperation Minister Michel </F> Roussin by unidentified correspondent -- live]    [Text] [Correspondent] You are dealing with this operation  to evacuate French nationals from Rwanda in cooperation with the  defense and the foreign ministries. How is the evacuation going  on?    [Roussin] I would add that the prime minister is also  following the situation closely. He kept very well informed  from Peking, and urged us to speed up the process we have begun.    The evacuation of French nationals is continuing. It began  yesterday evening. Things are quite complicated. We are very  worried about the situation in Kigali, but we were able to  collect people in their homes, assemble them at a number of  meeting points in the capital, and then transfer them to the  airport along roads which our paratroopers control -- there are  just over 500 of them, not 400 as you said in an earlier report.    [Correspondent] Just over 150 French nationals have left  Rwanda. There are about 450 left?    [Roussin] Yes, 450 are left, but we will also probably have  a  role to play in looking after the 1,500 Belgians, the 300  Americans, and the 200 plus other Europeans. There is also a  large Italian community.    [Correspondent] There are just over 3,000 foreign nationals  in Rwanda?    [Roussin] Yes, something like that.    [Correspondent] Are you confident that the French and the  others be able to leave this country?    [Roussin] Yes, I am confident, because the operation is  working well. Our capacity allows us to evacuate the people we  are assembling at the airport very quickly. We have sufficient  air capacity. We have Belgian air capacity in reserve. The  Americans are in Bujumbura. A plane is on its way from Italy.  So we have been the spearhead of this operation, which is a  protective, a security, a humanitarian operation. We are very  committed to it.    [Correspondent] You say this is a protective operation. The  rebels have asked you to remain neutral. Will you remain  neutral?    [Roussin] France has always been neutral in the conflict  which for years has set Hutus and Tutsis. in opposition to each  other. It is thanks to us that these two ethnic groups got  round the table at Arusha in Tanzania last August. We have  always done everything to ensure the return of calm to Rwanda.  War has broken out again, and the Rwandans will have to deal  with this, stopping the massacres, ensuring the return of  peace, signing a cease-fire. France will always be present if it  is asked, but this action is just a security action to evacuate  our compatriots.    [Correspondent] If the rebels were to enter Kigali, would  the  French remain absolutely neutral?    [Roussin] Absolutely. Our only mission is to ensure the  protection and the evacuation of our compatriots.    [Correspondent] You spoke of massacres. Have there really  been tens of thousands of dead as has been claimed?    [Roussin] There have been massacres. Information at our  disposal from witnesses in Rwanda indicates that there have been  massacres.    [Correspondent] Thank you Michel Roussin.</p>

The agency plans the move to prevent domestically produced  rice from flowing to dealers on unauthorized markets to secure a  smooth rice supply until the 1994 rice crop appears on the  market full scale, the officials said.    The agency has decided to supply 100,000 tons of early rice  by the end of October.    The amount of incentives has yet to be decided, they said.  The agency plans to pay the incentives out of a 50 billion yen  budget in fiscal 1993 for balanced rice supply-demand for the  three coming years.    On the other hand, the National Federation of Agricultural  Cooperative Associations is also considering paying about 15,000  yen per 60 kilograms of rice to farmers in advance to facilitate  collection of rice for unauthorized markets.    On the recent rice shortage due to last year's poor domestic  crop, Farm Minister Eijiro Hata said Sunday [20 March] the rice  supply will be sufficient, denying a future shortage.    Hata said in a lecture in Omiya, Saitama Prefecture, that  20,000 to 40,000 tons of imported rice are being unloaded daily  at Japanese ports against Japan's rice consumption of 500,000  tons a month.    If half of the consumption is supplied by imports, a daily  import of 10,000 tons of rice is sufficient for supply, he said.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich by Anatoliy </F> Gulyayev; place and not given; under the rubric "In the  Commonwealth": "My Main Political Aim Is the Restoration of  Economic Union With Russia. The Leader of the Belarus  Government Has Given Our Correspondent an Interview in Which He  Talks About the Problems Connected With the Solution of This  Question"]    [Text] Republic of Belarus -- [Gulyayev] Vyacheslav  Frantsevich, in one of your speeches you said: "The Government  has a concept. The cornerstone of that concept is cooperation  with Russia..." But the opposition regards putting the question  that way as opposing the sovereignty of Belarus and the  agreement on the creation of a single monetary system as yet  another manifestation of a "pro-Russian, pro-empire" policy. On  the other hand, to judge from the reaction of Yegor Gaydar and  some other Russian politicians there are differing attitudes  toward the agreement there, too. Hence the following questions.  First, how does your government's policy tally with the  sovereignty of the republic? Second, is the unification of the  monetary systems a manifestation of normal business partnership?  Or is it pure philanthropy on Russia's part?    [Kebich] As for the opposition, these people represent a  very  small part of the republic's population. According to the  latest polls they represent around 4 percent. Their opinion is  that held by politicians who will do anything to get power. For  some of them any means will do, and that includes distortion of  the facts.    How can there be any question of an infringement of  sovereignty in the process of normal economic integration? If  that is the case you would have to say that those European  figures who are working for the introduction of a single means  of payment for Europe are bad patriots, too! Both there and  here it is a question of economic union among states, each of  which has its own state organization, Constitution, culture, and  traditions...    But as for philanthropy... Yes, different people cite  different figures -- trillions of dollars -- which Russia is  allegedly losing in the ruble zone.    Well, let us examine the situation. Let us start with the  fact that powerful production units created in the republic are  a constituent part of major technical cycles in Russia, too.  That is why Russian producers and consumers (unlike some  politicians) are keenly interested in economic union with  Belarus.    But no one should forget that the oil fields in Siberia, the  processing enterprises, and the gold and hard currency assets  were created by the joint labor of the peoples of all the  republics of the former Union. Including to a considerable  extent the labor of the Belarusian people.    Not to mention the oil pipelines running across the  republic's territory and transit routes to the West... If we  start adding everything up, I do not think that it will run to  trillions.    I mention all this not because I want to make any claims. I  would just like public opinion in Russia and Belarus to be  formed on the basis of a sober and all-around assessment of the  situation.    After all, the rate of our currency (we did not dream of  introducing it, incidentally, and did not dream of leaving the  ruble zone) against the Russian ruble was initially one to one.  It then fell for two reasons: The first is that prices for  energy sources rose sharply for us, the second is the Russians'  indebtedness for output already supplied. If Russian  enterprises paid us back the money that they owed us for that  output the ratio would have been different.    No, philanthropy simply has nothing to do with it.  Equitable partnership alone -- the most sober-minded and honest  politicians in Russia understand that.    [Gulyayev] However, the resistance to the ruble zone in  Russia looks very serious. Once again, this is Gaydar's  demarche...    [Kebich] You know, I do not think that the signing of the  agreement on the unification of the monetary systems was really  a serious reason for Gaydar's resignation from the government.  It goes far deeper. In my view, it may be expressed in general  terms as a difference of views between the premier and the  vice-premier on the path of the continuation of the reforms.    And the convenient pretext is... Belarus. Or it could be the  construction of the Russian parliament building, for example.  This is not a subject for discussion for serious politicians.  But as a pretext, I repeat, it will do.    [Gulyayev] You are doubtless right. But you know that there  are quite a few people in Belarus who say: Kebich's policy will  not work. There are too many forces in Russia who are opposed  to it... Tell me, have you taken the disposition of forces into  account? In particular, President Yeltsin's opinion?    [Kebich] I can cite my recent meeting with him. It lasted  three hours 30 minutes. I remember the president's words well:  The union with Belarus must be concluded as quickly as possible.  We stand to gain from this politically and economically.    [Gulyayev] Nevertheless, it cannot be ruled out that under  pressure from various political forces the decision on the ruble  zone will be postponed. Does your government have an  alternative option?    [Kebich] Of course it does. That option is our own  currency. We are ready for its introduction and, if necessary,  we will be able to carry it out fairly quickly.    [Gulyayev] But it is a question of orientation. After all,  recently in the republic there has been much debate about the  turn toward the West in counterbalance to the traditional  preference for the East. Increasingly often the option of the  Baltic-Black Sea market comes to mind. How do you regard this  idea?    [Kebich] In itself it is not new. The People's Front's  plans for the creation of a Baltic-Black Sea union have existed  for a long time. This union is based on a clearly expressed  desire to sever ties with Russia. But to lend the idea  plausibility, they cite various economic computations, of course.    I do not regard the question that way. I cannot even  tolerate the very title of the "Baltic-Black Sea union" (or  market as you put it). Because Belarus has always had market  relations -- production and economic relations -- with the  Baltic. Even when the question of the economic blockade of  Lithuania was being raised Belarus did not take part in that.  We traded and continue to trade with our neighbors in Poland  and Ukraine... These ties have never been broken off. So there  is no reason to talk of creating some special market here.    Russia is a completely different kettle of fish. So long as  my heart beats I will continue campaigning for a union with it  as I always have done and am doing now. It is not just a  question of economic circumstances. We are all linked by the  closest spiritual bonds. We have a common history and similar  cultures. There is no family which does not have kin or close  friends in Russia. Severing those ties would really cut to the  quick.    However, as we have already seen for ourselves, there are  people on both sides who want to do just that. In NARODNAYA  GAZETA, the organ of the Republic of Belarus Supreme Soviet,  recently, Zenon Poznyak, the leader of the People's Front, wrote  yet another article that was insulting to our Russian brothers.  What is more, this man, who regards himself as a serious  politician, made impudent territorial claims on Russia,  Lithuania, and Poland publicly for the first time!    I repeat that his followers are few. Whereas those who  support the union with Russia are industrial enterprise and  collective and state farm leaders and business structures who  are aware of the threat of further disintegration. The majority  of the Belarus population favor union, a fact which is  eloquently demonstrated not just by opinion poll findings but  also by the many letters sent to the organs of state power and  administration.    I think that with such support the government will succeed  in  implementing the decision on the economic union. And in this  way my government's main political will be achieved!    [Gulyayev] One of the most important conditions for  economic integration is the equality [adekvatnost] of economic  systems, you said in a new year's eve address to diplomats. But  does this not mean that Belarus will be forced to ape the  economic and political decisions of the Russian Government?  Including those which have led to the disintegration of  collective farms in the countryside?    [Kebich] You would have been entirely right if it were a  question of a political and economic union. But the ruble zone  is not a political and economic union. It is first and foremost  a single financial and monetary system. And that is all.    Russia will still have its Law on Land with all its  idiosyncracies. Just as we will still have our law which  envisages private ownership in very restricted limits -- less  than 20 percent of the land resources.    We will still have our law on the priority of agriculture  and  it is being implemented. In any event, whereas industrial  enterprises have already stopped working because of the shortage  of electricity not one milking operation on a single collective  farm has been disrupted for that reason. And the main field  campaigns have always been supplied with fuel.    Our policy of support for collective farms as the main  agricultural producers and the development of measures for the  social protection of peasants remains unchanged. Recently, for  example, by special government decree the national bank opened a  line of credit amounting to 715 billion rubles to finance costs  incurred in the preparation for sowing work...    We are not going to blindly copy the state system in Russia  either. In short, under the single monetary system Belarus will  still have the possibility of following its own path. Just as  Russia will. We have reached full understanding with Russia's  leaders on this point.    [Gulyayev] Understanding is a good thing. But our rural  readers are eternal pragmatists. They are accustomed to  assessing all events from the standpoint of what actual benefit  they bring. That is why we are putting the question in these  terms: How will the agreement on the single monetary system  affect the well being of the peasant, whether Belarusian or  Russian?    [Kebich] To begin, let me say that I, too, am a pragmatic  man. I do not like bombastic words, I prefer concrete and  down-to-earth matters. That is why I propose to examine the  situation using concrete examples.    Here is example number one: The energy sources presently  being supplied to the republic from Russia reach our peasants at  prices approximately one and one-half times higher than their  Russian counterparts. But the existence of the single monetary  system presupposes standard prices. So all the fuels and  lubricants for peasants will become cheaper. This means that  life will become easier for the Belarusian collective farm  member and private farmer.    Example number two: Customs duties alone add about 35-40  percent to the cost price of a tractor, for example an MTZ, the  moment that it crosses the border near Smolensk. But the  agreement on the ruble zone envisages a single customs area.  This means that the Smolensk peasant will be able to buy a  Minsk tractor (or a feed combine harvester, or an MAZ vehicle,  or a refrigerator) at almost half price. This means that life  will become easier for them too.    I could cite a great many examples of this kind. But they  all amount to the same thing: The economic union with Russia  will bring real, tangible advantages not just to the peasant but  to every citizen in our countries. And more and more people in  Belarus understand that...    [Gulyayev] Do you mean the people who form the so-called  "Kebich party"? After all, you know that this term has appeared  in some politicians' speeches, don't you? In other words, your  government is being viewed not even as a team of like-minded  people but as something considerably broader -- as a political  force. Do you agree with this assessment? If so, how do you  rate the chances of the "Kebich party" in the coming elections?    [Kebich] Yes, there has always been much hullaballoo and the  use of labels and stock phrases around me and my supporters.  First there was talk of a "team." Then they began saying that  this is not simply a team but a party. Generally speaking I am  not afraid of this word. Although there is an opinion that the  government should be outside party politics. But in real life  that is not the way of things. Thus it is possible that a party  will appear in the future... It is not ruled out. One thing is  clear: Whatever name is used, we, the sensible politicians and  economic managers, represent a real force which one way or  another is influencing political processes. Life will show how  powerful that influence is going to be.</p>

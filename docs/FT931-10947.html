			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / Taxes 'should rise Pounds 10bn' THE UK government should exercise caution over further cuts in interest rates and raise taxes by up to Pounds 10bn to steady the fiscal deficit, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development said yesterday. The 24-nation body says an over-aggressive programme of cuts in base rates after the drop from 10 per cent to 6 per cent since last September could trigger an inflationary burst that might have to be controlled by monetary tightening. In this case, 'output would be stronger for at most a brief period'. In its latest review of the UK economy, the OECD advocates an extension of value added tax to items such as food and household energy bills. This measure would raise up to Pounds 11bn a year and is thought to be under examination by the Treasury ahead of the Budget on March 16. The study is mildly upbeat about recovery prospects, predicting growth in gross domestic product of 1.3 per cent this year and 2.4 per cent in 1994. But it warns that the risk of significant inflationary pressures are 'not negligible', given the lower import prices caused by sterling's devaluation and the possibility of growth in consumer demand if any upturn proves strong. The study was completed last month by OECD economists, after consultations with the Treasury and Bank of England, and before this week's slide in the pound. The OECD estimates that under present policies the ratio of government debt to GDP would grow to 45 per cent in 1994, up from 36 per cent last year and 29 per cent in 1990. To halt this rise the OECD favours a tightening of fiscal policy. This would also prevent a further rise in the ratio of the public sector borrowing requirement to GDP. The OECD says this figure, excluding privatisation proceeds, will reach 7.5 per cent in 1993, before falling back to 6.5 per cent next year - the same level as in 1992. The OECD says about 70 per cent of the deterioration in the PSBR since 1990 can be accounted for by higher social security spending and lower taxes caused by the recession. Other factors include spending increases on health and transport announced in late 1991. According to the Treasury the 1992-93 PSBR is likely to be Pounds 37bn, rising to about Pounds 44bn in 1993-94. Even though the government has ruled out giving the Bank of England greater control over setting interest rates, the OECD says that removing this area from Treasury control might make monetary policy less subject to political pressures. It could help control inflation in the long run. The study also urges: Tougher regulations covering recently privatised UK utility companies to prevent them pushing up profits by exploiting dominant market positions. More efforts to boost education and training. The OECD says reform in these areas 'remains a priority'. Continued privatisation of state-owned enterprises and cuts in the number of public services provided free. Such measures could increase their efficiency. Housing market reforms to enable people to move home more easily, so reducing barriers to people switching jobs between regions. 1993 Economic Survey of United Kingdom.

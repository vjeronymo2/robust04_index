			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / Mexico puts last companies on sale THE Mexican government aims to wrap up its privatisation programme this year by selling 37 more state companies, the Finance Ministry announced yesterday. The sales could raise Dollars 4bn-Dollars 5bn and, as with previous privatisation receipts, most of the money will be used to retire public debt. The administration of President Carlos Salinas has so far sold, or closed down, 362 state-owned companies, for a total of 64.5bn pesos, or around Dollars 22bn (Pounds 14.4bn). The government will sell off by March, in a single tranche, the state-run television Channels 7 and 13, the national newspaper El Nacional, and various cinemas. Its declared aim is to create a media company able to compete with Televisa, Mexico's dominant entertainment group. Televisa has interests ranging from television (90 per cent of the market), to the Mexico City football team, video shops and record labels. It has long used its domination to support the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, in continuous power since 1929. The government also hopes to sell Aseguradora Mexicana, the state-owned insurance company, assets of the Fertimex fertiliser company, several hotels, and concessions to run most of the country's main ports, including those at Acapulco, Lazaro Cardenas, and Manzanillo. One of Mexico's recently privatised companies, Aeromexico, has had its apparently successful bid for AeroPeru contested by the Peruvian runner-up, Naviera Santa. AeroMexico and a consortium of Peruvian investors bid Dollars 54m for 70 per cent of AeroPeru over the weekend, Dollars 8.7m more than Naviera Santa. Naviera claimed that the Mexican carrier controlled other members of the consortium, and thus had broken the rule against foreign majority acquisition.</p>

			<p>930601 FT  01 JUN 93 / Fiat cuts dividend heavily as profits fall FIAT, Italy's biggest private company, yesterday bowed to the pressures of a depressed car market and heavy investment spending by slashing its dividend by more than half to L100 for ordinary shares and L130 for non-voting savings stock. The heavy cut, for the second year in succession, was accompanied by news that net profits at Fiat Auto, the group's mainstream car subsidiary, fell to just L16bn (Pounds 7.02m) last year from L415bn in 1991. Group net profits in 1992, buoyed by Fiat's profitable non-industrial activities and extraordinary earnings from asset sales, dropped by more than half to L551bn after minority interests from L1,114bn in 1991. Turnover rose by about 4.6 per cent to L59,106bn. In spite of the pressure on earnings, which shows little sign of improving this year, Fiat appears intent on pursuing its ambitious investment plans, which pushed net group indebtedness to L3,849bn last December from L270bn the previous year. The company confirmed its L40,000bn investment programmed for 1992-95 and revealed that investment and R&amp;D spending in 1992, mostly on developing new models and plant, rose to L8,526bn from L6,683bn, representing 14.4 per cent of sales. The poor figures, which were widely expected, have not been matched by any acceleration of the plans to bring forward a change of guard at the group. Mr Giovanni Agnelli, chairman, and Mr Cesare Romiti, managing director, have both indicated recently that they do not intend to step down before the June 1994 annual meeting. A year ago Fiat cut its dividend by 38 per cent from L370 per ordinary share to L260. Its message of continuity in the face of adversity in the car market has been further tested this year. Fiat's share of the domestic car market it once dominated has continued to edge down and is now hovering at little over 43 per cent. Matters have worsened in recent months as Italian demand for new cars has belatedly reflected the downturns seen elsewhere in Europe. April new car sales figures showed a fall of 28.4 per cent. Fiat does not appear to have benefited greatly from the lira's fall. Car importers have maintained market share in Italy.</p>

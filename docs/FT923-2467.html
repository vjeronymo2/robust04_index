			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / GPA puts off order for 154 Boeings GPA Group, the aircraft leasing company, has agreed in principle with Boeing to defer delivery of up to 154 aircraft worth Dollars 5bn (Pounds 2.7bn) for up to three years. The agreement, which still has to be finalised, would give the group an important breathing space in the aftermath of its aborted Dollars 800m flotation. Mr Jim King, GPA's vice-chairman, said the agreement was subject to a number of conditions which include completion of the group's equity raising plans. It has recently unveiled a plan to raise Dollars 350m in a convertible preference share issue. GPA has also reached agreements in principle with aircraft manufacturers to receive Dollars 650m from them over the next 18 months. The funding would be in the form of loans to help the group lease aircraft in difficult new markets and the return to GPA of some pre-delivery payments for aircraft it had ordered. The tentative agreement with Boeing should help reassure investors. However, it is clear from yesterday's announcement that Boeing expects GPA's existing shareholders to show their support for the group first. GPA said the agreements were dependent on each other and Boeing and its institutional shareholders wanted to be sure both sides were being supportive. If the deal goes ahead GPA's firm orders will be cut by Dollars 1.5bn in both 1993 and 1994. It has agreed to buy Dollars 12bn of aircraft by the end of the decade. The importance of the deal for GPA is underlined by the fact that GPA would not have to cancel orders. Cancellation would result in it losing its Dollars 353.8m of aircraft pre-delivery payments. Boeing would not comment on whether the group would pay a penalty for the deferral. GPA is currently locked in negotiations with other aircraft manufacturers, including Airbus, Boeing and McDonnell Douglas, to reach similar agreements. Mr King said the deal was aimed at countering the negative perception of the scale of GPA's financing and marketing challenge. 'This will ensure that our firm commitments are appropriate to our available capital and our view of market demand.' Boeing said it had already announced it was reducing monthly production of its 737 aircraft from 21 to 14 this autumn.</p>

			<p>930426 FT  26 APR 93 / Observer: Rare document Considering that it exists to promote independent non-executive directorships - and is chaired by Sir Adrian Cadbury of corporate governance, no less - Pro-Ned is scarcely a model of openness when it comes to circulating its own annual report and accounts. Perish the thought, but could one of the reasons be that, just as directors' pay rises are coming in for such sharp criticism, the 1992 figures show the organisation's highest paid director received a healthy 9 per cent increase to a comfortable Pounds 77,812? Since it would appear from the accounts that Pro-Ned is lacking a remuneration committee at the moment, perhaps its board should consider creating one to investigate such questions.</p>

			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report PLATINUM closed well below an early eight-month high of Dollars 373.50 a troy ounce on the London bullion market. SILVER eased and GOLD ended only marginally above Friday's close as relative calm at funeral services for slain African National Congress Nationalist Chris Hani eased fears of supply disruptions. While many stayed away from work, the gold and platinum mines were unaffected. Three-month COPPER consolidated just above Dollars 1,900 a tonne at the close on the LME, while other metals finished easier. Trading was less active as some semblance of stability entered the market after last week's collapse to 5 1/2 -year lows of Dollars 1,870. But the market was unable to sustain a technical rally towards Dollars 1,950. London COCOA prices were easier by the close with initial liquidation in the US prompting further sales in London. A lack of significant industry buying was preventing any upturn in the market, dealers said. There were no fresh fundamental influences, and volatility was expected to be limited until the fate of the Ivorian mid-crop became clear next month. Compiled from Reuters</p>

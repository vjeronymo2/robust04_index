			<p>920615 FT  15 JUN 92 / Fierce fighting rage on eastern borders of Nagorno Karabakh Fierce fighting raged over the weekend on the eastern borders of Nagorno Karabakh, the Armenian-dominated enclave within Azerbaijan, as both Azeri and Karabakh forces attacked and captured villages, mostly outside of Karabakh's frontiers, writes John Lloyd in Moscow. It is the first serious fighting since Karabakh and Armenian forces drove a corridor between the enclave's western borders and Armenia after expelling Azeri troops from strongholds inside Karabakh. An Azeri offensive along the eastern Karabakh front on Armenian-held villages outside the enclave's borders appears to have been a success initially.  However, a counter-offensive yesterday was said by the Karabakh self-defence headquarters to have succeeded in recapturing some of the 15 villages claimed to have been taken by the Azeris.</p>

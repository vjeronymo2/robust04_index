			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter A. Portov; first paragraph is newspaper's </F> introduction]    [Text] The Russian Pacific Fleet is likely to resume  dumping into the sea liquid nuclear waste, the product repairs  to nuclear-powered submarines. Despite Japan's emergency plan  to stop the dumping, the resumption is likely to go ahead  because Russia does not have enough nuclear waste treatment  facilities and is being urged to promote the mass dismantling of  nuclear-powered submarines in accordance with the second  Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START II). Reporter Portov  recently obtained information from several high-ranking Pacific  Fleet officers about nuclear-powered submarines, nuclear weapons  facilities near Vladivostok, and Russia's handling of nuclear  waste disposal.    "The graveyard of holdovers from the East-West Cold War era"  is now in a terrible condition and out of control. Portov  reports on the current situation in an area of Russia which  foreigners are still forbidden to enter.    Vladivostok -- The Bolshoy Kamen Bay, the Cape of Maidel  [name as published], and the Strelok Bay are located between  Vladivostok and Nakhodka. The Pacific Fleet's nuclear  weapons-related facilities, such as nuclear-powered submarine  bases, underground nuclear warhead storage sites, docks designed  to handle nuclear- powered craft, and nuclear waste treatment  facilities are concentrated in the area. Foreigners are  prohibited from entering.    Nuclear waste yielded at Zvezda nuclear-powered submarine  dock, which is located in the Bolshoy Kamen Bay, is the  radioactive liquid at issue in Russian plans to dump waste into  the Sea of Japan. About 20 nuclear-powered submarines are  currently under repair in the dock. There are also four nuclear  reactors in the dock from disassembled submarines. The reactors  are known as "cigarette butts."    Many of the repairs are made upon the nuclear reactors  involved. Repeated cleaning of the reactors' external circuits  with cooling water produces a large amount of radioactive waste  liquid. In addition, nuclear-powered submarines in the Zvezda  dock are equipped with SLBM [submarine launched ballistic  missile] launchers, the numbers of which are due to be reduced  in accordance with START II.    As far as START II is concerned, Russia plans to dismantle  eight of the submarines currently in the dock. Also, before the  end of the year, it will move a 365-class nuclear-powered  submarine equipped with a SLBM launcher from Russia's largest  submarine base on the Kamchatka Peninsula to the Zvezda dock for  dismantling.    There are two nuclear waste discharge ships in the Zvezda  dock. They are "TNT-5" and "TNT-27." Both are currently full of  radioactive liquids.    Another reason Russia is in haste to dump nuclear waste into  the Sea of Japan and other waters is the delay in its  procurement of new nuclear waste discharge ships. The  procurement was proposed at a nuclear waste council meeting held  at the Pacific Fleet headquarters on 5 December. Because the  Russian Government is currently in difficult financial  conditions and because such ships are built in Ukraine,  immediate construction and procurement of the ships is unlikely.  Nevertheless, a high-ranking Pacific Fleet officer at  headquarters said: "If we have new ships, we can dump nuclear  waste not only into the Sea of Japan but also into waters  further away in the Pacific. But...." His remarks made it  clear that the only option left to Russia was marine dumping of  nuclear waste, which is banned under the London Convention.    Another reason is one that has greatly irritate officers at  the fleet headquarters in charge of dumping nuclear waste. The  Pacific Fleet owns at least 14 support ships, of which four  could be refitted to become nuclear waste storage ships.  However, to make money, all 14 have been leased to  newly-established corporations by former Pacific Fleet Commander  Furatov [name as published], who was dismissed from his post in  the spring, and other high-ranking officers. The ships are  currently being used for commercial purposes.    The headquarters' prosecution bureau is interrogating about  15 former high-ranking officers, including Furatov, on suspicion  of having "illegally leased the support ships." Nevertheless,  because of the lease contracts, it will be impossible to refit  them as nuclear waste discharge ships in the near future.    There is another nuclear-submarine dock at Chazima Bay [name  as published] in the off-limits zone. Called No. 30 dock, it is  currently closed, and falls under direct control of Russian  Naval headquarters. In 1985 there was an accident at the dock  which killed eight people. There was a blast from a nuclear  reactor due to a rapid rise in the temperature of cooling water  which occurred when the reactor was opened for repair.    It is believed that when Russia resumes nuclear waste  dumping  it will use ships at the Zvezda dock, such as "TNT-5," but will  probably move them to No. 30 dock to elude the vigilance of  other countries. It is thought the ships will then leave No. 30  dock to dump nuclear waste or they will be scuttled in the near  seas.    There is a solid nuclear waste dumping site and an  underground nuclear weapons storage depot at the Cape of Maidel.  This dumping site is also full of nuclear waste. It is said  that Russia has many times dumped nuclear waste from the site  into the Sea of Japan and other waters.    Reactors from dismantled nuclear-powered submarines  represent  the most troublesome aspect of handling solid nuclear waste.  They are called "cigarette butts."    A high-ranking Pacific Fleet officer said: "The Northern  Fleet has also disposed of cigarette butts in the waters off the  Kolskiy Peninsula in the Barents Sea. If Russia dismantles more  nuclear- powered submarines in accordance with START II, the  Pacific Fleet may also have to start dumping its cigarette butts  into the sea."    There is a nuclear-powered submarine base and an underground  nuclear warhead storage center in Pavlovsk in Strelok Bay. The  submarine base is the largest in the Maritime Kray. In the bay  there are two abandoned sunken submarines.</p>

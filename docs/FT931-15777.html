			<p>930111 FT  11 JAN 93 / Top Kenyan poll official's debts were written off KENYAN government officials ordered a state-controlled bank to write off the Ks30m (Pounds 555,000) debt of a former judge soon after he was appointed to chair the commission that organised last month's election, according to legal sources in Nairobi. Further information about the financial record of Mr Zachaeus Chesoni, appointed to the commission in September 1991, is contained in a confidential file given to Mr Justice Telford Georges, leader of the 38-member Commonwealth group that monitored the poll. In his first public comment on the dossier, Mr Justice Georges sharply rebuked the Kenyan authorities. Interviewed by telephone in the Bahamas, he said: 'The government should not have persisted in keeping Mr Chesoni on as chairman of the electoral commission.' Bankruptcy proceedings against Mr Chesoni were initiated by the Kenya Commercial Finance Co Ltd, part of the state-owned Kenya Commercial Bank. The bank obtained judgment in its favour but was instructed by a government official not to pursue its claim. The file reveals that in 1984 a state-controlled bank dropped an action to recover a Ks20.9m debt incurred while he was a high court judge. During 1990, the bank revived its action to enforce the judgment. But in 1991, according to legal sources in Nairobi familiar with the case, the bank wrote to its lawyers telling them to drop the action because the government had instructed the bank to write off the debt, now standing at Ks30m as a result of accrued interest. This occurred soon after the decision to appoint Mr Chesoni to the electoral commission. Opposition parties have rejected the election, saying that electoral malpractices helped President Daniel arap Moi retain the presidency. Testing times ahead for Kenyan observers, Page 5</p>

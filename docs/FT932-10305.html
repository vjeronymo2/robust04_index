			<p>930510 FT  10 MAY 93 / Polly Peck creditors await administrators' report CREDITORS to Polly Peck will be waiting anxiously for the latest report from the group's administrators at the end of this month after Mr Asil Nadir's escape from bail to Cyprus last week. Claims by Mr Nadir that he will attempt to regain control of companies in the group are likely to de-stabilise attempts by accountants to recover assets on creditors' behalf. Mr Michael Jordan, one of the group's joint administrators at accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand, said last week that he had been on the verge of an agreement with the authorities in northern Cyprus to arrange sales of Polly Peck assets. He flew back to Istanbul at the end of the week in an attempt to safeguard these arrangements. Another accountant close to the discussions said: 'Negotiations were at a delicate stage. Now the dust has to be allowed to settle.' Coopers said a Turkish buyer was near to agreeing to pay Dollars 20m (Pounds 12.90m) for Meyna, the Turkish fruit business, and a Cypriot was 'shortly' to pay about Dollars 10m for ICP, a pharmaceutical company. Administrators are meeting early this week to discuss a more detailed strategy on how to pursue their claims in the light of Mr Nadir's escape. They are due to report to creditors again at the end of this month and so far they are sticking to their projections made in October. These suggested dividends in the range 0 to 4p or 4p to 10p. Which range applied would depend on the unresolved assessment of how a Dollars 400m loan from PPI to Holdings BV for Del Monte was routed. Mr Jordan said no dividend was likely this year, although he might recommend to creditors that Polly Peck moves from administration into a voluntary arrangement or liquidation and insolvency procedures before then. The Dollars 400m loan represents the difference between the group's estimated liabilities in October 1990 of either Pounds 1.4bn or Pounds 1.6bn. Of the total, Pounds 632m is owed to banks and other creditors and Pounds 287m to bondholders. By October last year professional and legal fees and costs stood at Pounds 15.6m. There had been total payments of Pounds 66m and receipts of Pounds 68m, including realisations of non-core businesses and assets of Pounds 37m. Del Monte was sold in November last year for Dollars 499m, of which net proceeds left for distribution by the administrators are Dollars 218m. The most significant remaining assets include an 86 per cent stake in Vestel, which is quoted on the Istanbul stock exchange and an 18 per cent stake in Sansui, the Tokyo-quoted electronics group. Other outstanding assets in northern Cyprus include Unipac, Sunzest and Voyager Kibris, which manages four hotels. Coopers said the total value was about Dollars 40m, (Pounds 26m) but it could not give an exact sum since it had been denied access to the accounts of the companies on the island. The remaining prospects for creditors will come from any recoveries from writs issued by Mr Christopher Morris at Touche Ross, another joint administrator. These include Pounds 378m against Mr Nadir, Pounds 70m against Citibank and possible future action against Stoy Hayward, Polly Peck's auditors. Touche said legal proceedings had already achieved a settlement for an undisclosed amount against Impexbank, and it was pursuing judgments against Mr Nadir's mother, the Industrial Bank of Kibris and Unipac.</p>

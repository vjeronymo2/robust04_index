			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / Political Notebook: Economic policy will define Labour's future There is nothing like a leadership battle. The blend of ideological conflict and personal rivalries produces a unique chemistry. It is raw politics. So Labour MPs are looking forward to the party's impending contest with relish and trepidation. Relish because power is what motivates them - even the humblest backbench MP has had to fight to get to Westminster. Trepidation because the forces unleashed in such struggles are difficult to control. It is no discredit to Labour that preparations for John Smith's funeral tomorrow have been accompanied by frenetic behind-the-scenes activity to choose a successor. Politics abhors a vacuum. But Mr Smith would have expected his colleagues to show the party has grown up: that it can conduct its arguments without re-igniting the vicious factionalism of the past. So far that has been the case. One or two animosities are visible. To say that Mr Gordon Brown and Mr Robin Cook are not close friends is to be guilty of serious understatement. But by and large there is little of the corrosive malice which infected Labour during the late 1970s and early 1980s. Mr Neil Kinnock, who shifted decisively the party's centre of gravity during the 1980s, deserves much credit. Mr Smith healed many of the wounds inflicted during that process. But if the debate is now more mature, it has not gone away. Labour has still to decide its future. The left, renamed traditionalists, has not disappeared. The leadership contest will be a decisive test of the strength of the modernisers. The battleground will be the economy. It always is. Mr Gordon Brown, vying for the modernisers' candidacy with Mr Tony Blair, has done more than he has been thanked for to prepare the ground for a credible economic strategy. Either man - and for now Mr Blair is well ahead  -will build on the foundations. The tax and spending pledges made at the last general election have been dropped. Mr Brown has established that his party can no longer tax for the sake of it. Nationalisation has been removed from Labour's vocabularly. The new emphasis on private-sector infrastructure projects has implications far wider than the provision of the odd high-speed rail link. Messrs Brown and Blair are out to shift the focus from an historic obsession with ownership to securing agreement on the objectives of policy. Making the economy work well is more important to the unemployed than soaking the very rich. In spite of constant harrying from disgruntled union bosses, Mr Brown has managed also to switch attention to the supply side of the economy. Macroeconomic policy has ceased to be seen in terms of crude demand management. Instead a stable macro-economic framework is offered as an anchor for education, training and investment policies which would increase productive capacity. This fundamental emphasis on the ends, not means, is at the heart of the modernisers' project. It has an application far beyond economic policy. It would undercut, for example, Labour's traditional commitment to uniformity and universality in welfare provision or state education. But the left has become impatient. Mr Smith gave them a commitment to full employment and to a national minimum wage. Neither Mr Brown nor Mr Blair could easily abandon the pledges. But traditionalists now want more. The battle lines have become blurred - but the constituencies represented by Mr John Prescott and, to a lesser extent, Mr Cook want an ambitiously expansionist strategy. A Labour government should pull the macroeconomic levers to deliver faster growth. Higher output and incomes and a fall in the jobless total would then square the eternal circle between tax and spending. Mr Prescott is unimpressed by his rivals' respect for Treasury spending and borrowing rules or for their willingness to play by the government's exchange rate rules. Look what happened when Labour backed the Tories on membership of the European exchange rate mechanism. Mr Cook is no friend of the City. He sees the potential for an interventionist role in fighting the British disease of short-termism. The left wants Labour to lift its sights and inspire the electorate. Promising to run the economy by Tory rules will not deliver a Labour government. And should not the unions, the social partners, have a bigger say? Other important arguments will have to be played out over the next few weeks: over the party's institutional links with the unions, over Europe, over the welfare state. But the issue which will define the contest is the economy. The party's choice as leader will in turn define the ground on which it fights, and wins or loses, the general election.</p>

			<p><P> August 1, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DODGER CHARGE SLOWED;  </P> <P> BASEBALL: DEFENSIVE LAPSES KEY REDS' 5-2 VICTORY. LOS ANGELES FALLS EIGHT GAMES  BEHIND AGAIN.  </P> <P> In order to truly catch pennant fever, the Dodgers learned Tuesday, you must  first catch the ball.  </P> <P> Like an aspiring beauty queen whose blemishes show up under pressure, the  Dodgers displayed a defense against the Cincinnati Reds that made the 42,242  fans at Dodger Stadium blush.  </P> <P> Kal Daniels overran a fly ball. Mike Scioscia missed a pitch. Mike Sharperson  missed a grounder. Three mistakes, three runs. It was all the Reds needed in a  5-2 victory that ended their losing streak at eight games while stopping the  Dodgers winning streak at five.  </P> <P> "What good teams do is take advantage of mistakes, and tonight they did just  that," said pitcher Tim Belcher, who gave up just five hits in seven innings  but fell to 9-8. "I felt I could cover up some of our miscues with a big  fastball, but I didn't have it. If we are going to get back into this race, we  have to make the plays . . . and pitch well and hit well."  </P> <P> Added Scioscia: "For us not to give Tim support in a big game like this is  discouraging."  </P> <P> This sort of defense is not completely unusual: The Dodgers have made more  errors than all but four other National League teams this season. But Tuesday  night, with the third-place Dodgers having a chance to move to within six games  of the first-place Reds, it stuck out like a fielder with no glove.  </P> <P> "That's the darned thing about it. We just snapped a five-game winning streak,  but it caused a two-game swing in the standings. It was like losing three games  instead of one," said Belcher, whose team trails the Reds by eight games and  second-place San Francisco by 2 1/2. "Now the Reds go home for a month while we  go on the road for a month."  </P> <P> His calendar is inexact, but his point his clear. After tonight's makeup game  here with San Francisco, the Dodgers embark on the season's longest trip,  covering 15 games in 15 days in four cities. The first seven games of the trip  are in San Francisco and Cincinnati.  </P> <P> And they might be forced to do it without second baseman Juan Samuel, who left  the clubhouse on crutches Tuesday after spraining his ankle while trying to  beat out a bunt in the fourth inning. He will undergo X-rays today.  </P> <P> The Reds scored one run in the first inning after Hal Morris started the game  with a triple that a hustling Daniels overran in left field.  </P> <P> After the Dodgers tied it, the Reds scored another run in the third inning  after pitcher Jose Rijo singled and eventually moved to third on a passed ball  by Scioscia.  </P> <P> Then, leading 3-2 in the fifth, the Reds scored on an error by second baseman  Sharperson, who had just entered the game after Samuel departed.  </P> <P> The game essentially ended in the seventh inning in frustrating fashion, as  Daniels' three-run home run trot after he hit a 395-foot fly ball was  interrupted by Eric Davis' catch at the center-field wall.  </P> <P> Daniels turned his trot into a dance of anger. He leaped and shouted around  first base while the Reds ran off the field with two Dodger runners stranded  and a 4-2 lead intact.  </P> <P> "I hit it square . . . it just didn't do out," Daniels said. "I think it would  have broke the Reds' back."  </P> <P> Instead the Reds, who shook up their clubhouse with some interesting maneuvers  including a revamped lineup, are feeling lucky again.  </P> <P> "We got a few breaks, and we took advantage of them," Manager Lou Piniella  said.  </P> <P> Dodger Notes  </P> <P> Jose Rijo pitched 6 1/3 strong innings, giving up two runs on six hits. Randy  Myers pickedup his 21st save. . . . Jim Neidlinger (pronounced NYDE-linger)  arrived at Dodger StadiumTuesday acting surprisingly calm for someone who will  make his first major league start today in the middle of a pennant race. "I  know what's going on," Neidlinger, 25, said. "If youfollow baseball in the  newspapers you know what is going on, but I'm not thinking about it. Ilook at  it like, I'm just going out trying to win a game. Nothing more." Neidlinger  said this attitude comes from enduring the rigors of seven minor league  seasons. "I've already been through a lot of ups and downs," Neidlinger said.  "Unfortunately, I've played in a lot of minor-league games, and I've learned a  lot of things. I do what I'm capable of doing, and usually things turn out all  right." Neidlinger is known as a sinkerball pitcher with good control. He  walked 34 in 119 2/3 innings in triple-A Albuquerque while going 8-5 with a  4.29ERA.  </P> <P> Mike Morgan's right ankle was feeling better Tuesday, and he said he will  likely make his scheduled start Saturday in San Francisco. Morgan turned the  ankle while covering first base in the ninth inning of his two-hit, 4-1 victory  over Cincinnati Monday. . . . The leading candidates to replace Ben Wade as  Dodger scouting director are Wade's assistant, Terry Reynolds, and scout Mel  Didier.  </P></p>

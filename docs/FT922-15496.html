			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / UK Company News: TIP Europe advances to Pounds 3.72m - Fleet cut by 1,000 but UK average daily rate rises by 11% TIP EUROPE, the trailer rental group which was refinanced last November, increased pre-tax profit by 51 per cent to Pounds 3.72m in the six months to January 31. On turnover of Pounds 54.9m (Pounds 53.3m), operating profit declined 12 per cent to Pounds 11.3m (Pounds 12.8m). Interest costs were cut by Pounds 1.1m to Pounds 7.59m as the group started to benefit from December's Pounds 29.2m rights issue. Interest cover was one of the stumbling blocks under the group's former multi-option finance facility, since replaced by a more relaxed arrangement with a 'club' of eight banks. The pre-tax line compared with Pounds 2.46m last time, although this figure was struck after a restructuring charge totalling Pounds 1.68m. Pre-tax profit in trailer rental declined to Pounds 2.5m (Pounds 3.1m) on turnover of Pounds 38.2m (Pounds 39.3m). A fall in profits on the Continent was partially offset by a near Pounds 1m turnround in the UK. Mr David Callear, chief executive, said the biggest success was an 11 per cent increase in the average daily UK rate. The fleet had been cut from more than 10,000 to less than 9,000, while the proportion utilised had stayed at 73 to 74 per cent. On the Continent, utilisation had fallen because of the weakness in UK ferry traffic from the Netherlands. In Germany, some custom had been lost because of constraints on the fleet. In general leasing, a profit fall in broking was offset by a doubling of profit to Pounds 700,000 in the Mobiel subsidiary that supplies temporary buildings. Mr Callear said Mobiel's market was mushrooming in the former East Germany. With the help of the rights issue, net debt, including leases and convertible bonds, fell from Pounds 166m to Pounds 132m, while net assets rose to Pounds 72.2m (Pounds 42.9m), halving gearing to 183 per cent. Mr Callear said this was comfortable for a rental/leasing business. Mr Jim Davis, chairman, said the group's emphasis had switched from chasing market share to profitability. On an increased tax rate of 23 (15) per cent, earnings per share rose to 2.58p (2.27p). The interim dividend, which was cut by two thirds last year, is raised to 0.64p (0.56p). A decision to sell the loss-making truck hire and distribution business led to an extraordinary charge of Pounds 640,000. COMMENT The last thing TIP wanted after its rescue from near bankruptcy was a deepening of the UK recession. Worries on that score had recently brought the share price down to little more than the rights issue price of 40p. These results have brought some relief through the elimination of losses in UK trailer rental and evidence of decent cash flow. The group continues to be run on a tight rein, with capital spending only growing to Pounds 20m this year. For the future, if TIP - and its bigger rival Tiphook - can continue to raise rates, the outlook for profitability gets much brighter. With the help of a reduced interest charge, full-year pre-tax profit is expected to rise to about Pounds 12m, giving a prospective multiple of less than 7 on yesterday's close of 43p. Although still requiring some boldness, it looks a classic recovery play.</p>

			<p>921224 FT  24 DEC 92 / Observer: Recycling centre Not only is London the capital of the world's foreign exchange markets and Europe's cultural scene, but it is also an important entrepot centre for Christmas cracker jokes, one of the few industries where Britain still maintains a world-class position. Unfortunately, early reports from this year's crop of crackers indicate that it has not been a vintage season. In case you haven't heard them, a few of the more memorable follow: What's the first thing to take when you're run down? The number of the car. How do you stop a herd of elephants charging? Take away their credit cards What do you call a blind reindeer? No idea. What wears a coat all winter and pants in the summer? The dog. Why is honey so expensive in Rio de Janeiro? Because there's only one 'B' in Brazil. 'Mummy, are we poisonous,' asked the baby snake. 'Yes, dear, why do you ask?' 'Cos, I've just bitten my tongue.' Where does a 200lb gorilla sit? Anywhere it wants. Two flies on a cornflake packet. 'Why are we running so fast?' asked one. 'Because it says tear along the dotted line,' says its mate. Which were the first animals out of the ark? The ones closest to the door. To err is human, to forgive is not company policy. Due to financial conditions, the light at the end of the tunnel will be turned off until further notice. Let's hope this is one prediction that will be proved wrong. Happy Christmas.</p>

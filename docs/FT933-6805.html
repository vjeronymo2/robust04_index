			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Half NZ wool stockpile sold THE NEW Zealand Wool Board says it has sold off half its stockpile of wool, reports Reuter from Wellington. In February 1991 the board stopped a price support scheme following the collapse of a similar system in Australia. It had held a maximum of 655,228 bales in the middle of the 1990-91 season. The wool has been sold off gradually to spread the impact on the market.</p>

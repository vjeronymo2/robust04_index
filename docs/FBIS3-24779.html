			<p>Language: <F P=105> Somali </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] A Somali National Alliance [SNA] spokesman has  said that since the SNA called for a cease-fire at the beginning  of October 1993, the U.S. and UN Operation in Somalia [UNOSOM]  forces have shot and killed about 60 people and injured more  than double that number. The victims include women--some of  them pregnant, children, and the elderly. All of them were  unarmed. The most recent of these savage acts was carried out  by the U.S. forces at about 0500 this morning, 31 January 1994,  near Kilometre Four in Mogadishu, when a U.S. armored personnel  carrier opened fire on civilians, some of whom were collecting  food from the Saudi agency. Some were walking along the street,  and others were going about their business. Eyewitnesses said  that the dead and injured number more than 30 people. [passage  omitted]    The report added that the number of deaths confirmed so far  is 17, with 13 injured. It was also reported that most of the  dead bodies were taken to houses. A spokesman called on the  Somali people to make known the number of those wounded and the  number of the dead who had been taken home.    He said that it is unfortunate that while the SNA was  striving to strengthen the cease-fire and keep away from  anything that would cause a confrontation, the foreign troops,  especially those of the United States, were engaged in a  massacre of the Somali people that can be seen as a continuation  of their enmity and revenge on the Somali people. The SNA was  expecting to heal the wounds of the past and has complained  strongly to the U.S. Government about the problems its troops  are inflicting on the Somali people. We ask for an explanation  why the U.S. forces are not observing the cease-fire and prefer  to continue with their enmity against Somali people.    Finally, the SNA spokesman called on the Somali people to  exercise tolerance and calm and called on foreign troops to stop  the unjust massacre they are carrying out against the Somali  people.</p>

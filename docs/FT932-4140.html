			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / International Company News: Electrolux sells stake in Email for ADollars 84.5m ELECTROLUX, the Swedish electrical appliance group, has sold a 10 per cent interest in Email, the Australian white goods company, to a group of international institutions for ADollars 84.5m (USDollars 56.5m). It retains an interest of just over 5 per cent in Email. Electrolux has 'no present intention' of further reducing its stake and said the disposal did not reflect any change in the commercial relationship between the two companies. Electrolux said the deal would generate a SKr200m (Dollars 27.4m) capital gain, but one-off costs on to the sale of a French operation meant it would have no overall impact on second-quarter results. Email distributes Electrolux products in Australia and uses the Swedish company's networks in Asia for export. For the year ended March, Email made profits after abnormal items of ADollars 55.5m on sales of ADollars 1.47bn.</p>

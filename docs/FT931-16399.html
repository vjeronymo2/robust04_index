			<p>930107 FT  07 JAN 93 / Number of new houses built last year fell THE NUMBER of new houses built last year fell to an 11-year low of 126,000, the National House-Building Council of Britain said yesterday, Andrew Baxter writes. Its figures are for private housing starts and represent a 3 per cent fall on the 1991 figure of 130,500. Starts during the fourth quarter were 26,400, 8 per cent lower than for the same period of 1991. The council points out that about 25,000 of the homes started last year were being built for housing associations, further demonstrating the depth of the recession in the speculative housing market.</p>

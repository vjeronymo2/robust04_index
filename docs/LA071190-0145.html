			<p><P> July 11, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SUMMIT ENDS IN COMPROMISE;  </P> <P> DISPUTE ON FARM TRADE RESOLVED  </P> <P> The world's richest democracies wrapped up their annual summit today, setting  conditions for sending "meaningful and sustained" financial aid to the Soviet  Union and agreeing to reduce worldwide agricultural subsidies.  </P> <P> The last-minute trade compromise finessed a nasty dispute over farm subsidies.  </P> <P> The summit urged that Western technical assistance be dispatched immediately to  help Moscow "mobilize its own resources," and the leaders ordered a study to  recommend ways to target future aid.  </P> <P> President Bush, in a wrap-up news conference, said the moves on Soviet aid were  "an effort to encourage forward motion and be helpful." Bush said he would  brief Mikhail S. Gorbachev on the summit results and had already sent a  preliminary cable.  </P> <P> In a final communique, the seven leaders called on the Soviet Union to "shift  resources substantially away from the military sector" and to "quit support"  for satellite states and nations involved in regional conflicts.  </P> <P> "Maybe this can lead" to direct cash support from the United States, he said.  But, Bush said, "I'm not enthusiastic about the intercontinental ballistic  missiles aimed at U.S. cities," and he said he found $5 billion a year in  Soviet aid to Cuba "a little contradictory."  </P> <P> Others were ready to move ahead. "We are on the front line as Europeans and  maybe we can help the United States understand why we want to help the Soviet  Union," Italian Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti said. "When someone is ill, you  don't want to wait for medicine."  </P> <P> Satisfied with their 11th-hour compromises on farm subsidies and the  environment, the leaders quickly concluded their 16th annual summit this  morning.  </P> <P> "This was a summit that addressed itself to a rapidly changing world," Bush  said.  </P> <P> Trade negotiators reached a compromise agricultural agreement in the early  hours today, and the seven heads of government spent just half an hour  reviewing the document before giving their approval at their final session at  Rice University.  </P> <P> The United States insisted on language calling for across-the-board cuts in all  categories of farm subsidies. But the agreement also contained ambiguous  language acceptable to the reluctant Europeans, urging each nation "to make  substantial, progressive reductions."  </P> <P> The farm dispute had threatened to disrupt the annual gathering.  </P> <P> British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd acknowledged that there had been some  hard words. "But it will be a more successful summit than if everybody had come  here determined to sing from the beginning a unified hymn of praise."  </P> <P> In a self-congratulatory final communique, the world leaders patted themselves  on the back for a global economy that was still chugging along, although at a  decidedly slow pace.  </P> <P> The communique also agreed to a pilot study to help save the Amazon rain  forests, but in a victory for the Administration, did not press for specific  reduction targets for the pollutants suspected of causing a global warming of  the environment.  </P> <P> The final communique basically recycled many of the environmental pledges made  by the same countries at last year's summit session in Paris.  </P></p>

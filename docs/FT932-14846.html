			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / The Lex Column: Scrip dividends Forte was not alone in slipping in an enhanced scrip dividend yesterday. Having mulled the option since its results last month, Redland did the same. The two cases are different, but they do suggest the fashion is becoming worryingly popular. One way of looking at Forte's decision, for example, is that, far from just cutting its dividend, it is trying to avoid paying one in cash at all. A feature of the scheme is that the requirements of those shareholders who do want cash are met by the placement of fresh shares in the market. In Forte's case, the decision looks suspiciously like a response to its cash-flow constraints. The company points to the contribution the savings will make to finance its acquisition of the Relais motorway service areas in France on which it expects a return of 15 per cent. But it had acquired those anyway last year. Redland's geographically uneven earnings flow has given it an acute ACT problem. The enhanced scrip dividend reduces its tax obligations and transfers financial benefit from the government to shareholders. From that perspective the move will enhance earnings in the short run. Even so, one wonders whether, after all the shares it issued to pay for Steetley, Redland really deserves the extra capital. It is a pity the ACT system has encouraged the market to forget the discipline inherent in the need to pay cash dividends.</p>

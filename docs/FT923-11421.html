			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / Size of loss depends on level of trading EURO DISNEY, dogged by bad publicity since opening its FFr2.4bn (Pounds 240m) theme park outside Paris on April 12, yesterday confirmed it was on course to make a loss in the current financial year after attracting 3.6m visitors in the park's first 102 days. Mr John Forsgren, finance director, said the group, which had hoped to break even this year, would be in the red for the 12 months to September 30, but that 'the magnitude of the loss would depend on the level of trading in the peak summer season'. Euro Disney's shares, which have been hit by recent adverse publicity about wide fluctuations in attendance and over-crowding on busy days, initially fell on the announcement but closed up FFr0.15 at FFr97.40. Euro Disney received operating revenue of FFr1.5bn in the three months to June 30, with FFr1.02bn coming from the theme park and FFr485m from the resort, which includes the six Euro Disney hotels. The group also made FFr973m from asset sales - compared with FFr1.33bn in the previous quarter - making a total income of FFr2.47bn. The hotels have sold 370,000 room nights with an average occupancy rate of 70 per cent which is 'slightly below expect-ations', according to Mr Forsgren. The hotels are currently 'almost full', he said, with average occupancy of 95 per cent as the park enters its peak trading period. Euro Disney denied reports that it had cut hotel rates for the summer season. However, it reduced rates at two hotels - the Santa Fe and the Sequoia Lodge - in June and is talking to tour operators about price reductions for the autumn and a new tariff for next year. Since the start of the European school holidays, attendance at Euro Disney has risen sharply and the past week has seen capacity crowds of more than 50,000 people a day, according to Mr Forsgren. He said attendance from the UK and Germany was well above expectations, but the number of French visitors was still below target. Disney lifted, Page 24; Lex, Page 20</p>

He said his two-hour meeting with Russian Prime Minister  Viktor Chernomyrdin focused on a wide range of issues related to  the concluding of a treaty on the principles for economic  cooperation between Russia and the Chechen Republic. The  Chechen official pointed out that "all the issues the Chechen  delegation raised before the Russian prime minister were  understood and approved.

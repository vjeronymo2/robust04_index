			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Proposed &sect;488.240, now incorporated into  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;488.426, stated that the State must arrange for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> orderly transfer of residents when a facility is closed or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its provider agreement is terminated. Further protection  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for residents is available in regulation. Section 489.55  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provides that payment is available for up to 30 days after  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the effective date of termination for eligible residents and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;441.11(a)(2) states that, in the case of continuation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FFP for Medicaid, the Medicaid agency must make reasonable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> efforts to transfer recipients to other facilities. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulation clearly gives the responsibility for orderly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transfer of residents to the State. Each case involving the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transfer of residents could potentially be different. We  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are, therefore, leaving it up to the State to decide, on a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> case-by-case basis, what steps need to be taken to reduce  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the risk of transfer trauma, understanding that the State's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsibility is to minimize the period of time during  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which residents are receiving less than adequate care.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter stated that a finding of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> immediate jeopardy will result in the facility's emergency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> closure and transfer of the residents. This commenter asked  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> where residents would be transferred if a county or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> particular area had too few available beds?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The finding of immediate jeopardy will not,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in and of itself, require States to close a facility and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transfer Medicare and Medicaid residents. In an emergency,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the State could transfer Medicare and Medicaid residents to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> another facility or facilities. There could be situations,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such as an earthquake or other natural disaster, where the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State would temporarily transfer residents to another  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility until the facility can adequately care for its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> residents. In this case, the facility did nothing wrong.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, in the case of immediate jeopardy, the facility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> failed to protect the health or safety of its residents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For immediate jeopardy situations, the statute at sections  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1819(h)(4) and 1919(h)(5) of the Act provides for immediate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> termination if the jeopardy is not removed, but it does not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> require the State to close the facility. However, when a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility is terminated for immediate jeopardy, the State has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> up to 30 days to transfer the facility's Medicare and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Medicaid residents. Most States have a relocation plan that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> outlines the circumstances under which the plan will be put  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> into effect and the procedures to be followed. These plans  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> usually provide for first attempting to place residents in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the closest facility or facilities and then attempting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> placement at increasingly distant facilities until available  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> beds are found. We believe it is unnecessary to mandate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures for States to follow in cases of closure or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transfer of residents, and that no greater procedural  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specificity is required in regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter expressed concern that after  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> coming to a nursing home with the expectation of living out  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the rest of one's life there, a resident may be forced to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> move to another location because of some technicality.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Termination and closure of a facility are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> among several remedies available to protect the health and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> safety of Medicare and Medicaid residents. Although it is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> possible that a noncompliant facility could be terminated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for not submitting to a plan of correction, as is required  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for continuing participation in the Medicare or Medicaid  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program, it is not likely. Most nursing homes are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interested in participating in the Medicare and Medicaid  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs and will not risk termination based on such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> noncompliance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Several commenters requested that we place  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> more requirements upon the States to assist residents,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should a facility lose its Medicare or Medicaid  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certification. Two of the commenters, representing consumer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> organizations, believe proposed &sect;488.240 is inadequate in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> terms of requirement specificity, and they provided a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> complete and detailed rewrite of the section. Their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> experience with closures and decertifications in the last 5  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> years has led them to believe that providers and regulators  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cannot be trusted to provide a ``safe and orderly'' transfer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process. As a result, their rewrite focuses on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recommendation that HCFA mandate the States to develop plans  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that provide requirements for the ``safe and orderly''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transfer of all residents when the State closes a facility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Included in the rewrite are provisions that outline  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specific residents' rights in the transfer process such as,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determining the location of the transfer, availability of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> counseling and support, and the transferring of residents'  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> possessions and trust funds. The commenters also address  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements for the new admitting facility, as well as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements for the coordination among appropriate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agencies, organizations and ombudsmen involved in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transfer process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

Description of Competition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Congress has mandated that the Department carry out ``a 5-year demonstration to determine the feasibility of facilitating partnerships between institutions of higher education and communities to solve urban problems through research, outreach and the exchange of information.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The COPC Act stipulates that grants are to go to public and private institutions of higher education to establish and operate Community Outreach Partnership Centers (COPC). These centers shall: ``(a) Conduct competent and qualified research and investigation on theoretical or practical problems in large and small cities; and (B) Facilitate partnerships and outreach activities between institutions of higher education, local communities, and local governments to address urban problems.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The specific problems that grants under the COPC program must focus on are ``problems associated with housing, economic development, neighborhood revitalization, infrastructure, health care, job training, education, crime prevention, planning, community organizing, and other areas deemed appropriate by the Secretary.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Furthermore, the COPC Act states: ``The Secretary shall give preference to institutions of higher education that undertake research and outreach activities by bringing together knowledge and expertise in the various social science and technical disciplines that relate to urban problems.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is clear from the statutory language quoted above, and the program requirements and selection criteria detailed below, that Congress intended that COPC be multi-disciplined, combine research with outreach, work with communities and local governments and address the multi-dimensional problems that beset urban areas. To be most effective during the term of the demonstration, the assisted research must have a clear near-term potential for solving specific significant urban problems. The selected institutions must have the capacity to apply their research results and to work with communities and local institutions, including neighborhood groups, in applying research results to specific real-life urban problems, including design of comprehensive strategies and consolidated housing and community development plans to resolve these problems.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D.

Finally, each institution may be part of only one consortium or submit only one application, although the application can include various schools within the institution.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> E.

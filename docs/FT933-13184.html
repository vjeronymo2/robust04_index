			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / Croat pressure mounts on Mostar CROAT forces yesterday stepped up their drive to expel Moslems from Mostar, south-western Bosnia, as Bosnia's collective presidency discussed whether to attend talks in Geneva set to sanction the republic's partition along ethnic lines, writes Laura Silber in Belgrade. Mr Mirko Pejanovic, a Serbian member of the presidency, yesterday said the government wanted a 'federal state' with 'one foreign policy and internationally recognised borders'. If the war continued, Bosnia should be proclaimed a United Nations protectorate. Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, warned that 'if the Moslems do not wish to lose everything they have to sit at the negotiating table as soon as possible'. Serb forces were reported yesterday to have seized the southwestern part of Mount Igman, a key defence point for Sarajevo. Bosnian radio said the Croatian Defence Council had interned 10,000 Moslems, mostly men, near Capljina southwest of Mostar. It was using them to dig trenches and as human shields.</p>

			<p>920316 FT  16 MAR 92 / Letter: IBM seeks to clarify issue of counterfeit memory Sir, We refer to your article 'IBM deals blow to computer leasing' (Employment, March 2), which contains information that may mislead your readers. The issue is one of counterfeit memory: IBM has discovered that memory originally manufactured by IBM has been altered and refabricated by some third parties and misrepresented as genuine IBM parts. It is this misrepresentation that IBM wants to stop. This unlawful practice is detrimental to IBM's product integrity and overall reputation as a manufacturer. Such refabricated parts are not covered by IBM's maintenance agreements; non-genuine IBM parts never were. So, contrary to what your article implied, IBM has not changed its policy: IBM will continue to maintain re-configured products that contain genuine IBM parts. Furthermore, two additional pieces of information will be of interest to your readers. First, IBM did not change the price of its 128MB memory cards, as might be concluded by some readers of the article. Second, your article also mentioned legal action by IBM in the US. Regrettably however, it did not mention that the court has issued an order, based on an agreement between the parties, under which Comdisco, among other obligations, is obliged properly to represent and to label any altered memory and to disclose the fact that such memory is not eligible for IBM maintenance.

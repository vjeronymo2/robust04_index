			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / Media Futures: Magazines score big with factor X A new breed of magazines is making a splash in the US. So-called Generation X publications with self-consciously unconventional covers and enigmatic names like Who Cares, Bikini, Wired and Monk, are the latest trend in magazine publishing. They are aimed at - and usually published by - the 18-to-30-year-olds who comprise Generation X, and their numbers are expanding fast. Among this year's entrants: Swing, Axcess and Might. The slant of the magazines offers a new way to court a demographic segment that the entertainment and advertising industries have found elusive and difficult to please. 'They allow advertisers to appeal to young trend-setters,' says Harvey Goldhersz, assistant media director and Generation X guru at the Grey Advertizing agency in New York. Early Generation X magazines were launched with low budgets and low circulations, but the latest versions have more financial beef behind them. The magazines will not reveal the size of their funding, but savvier ones like Swing, Wired and Axcess are sleek and laden with advertising. Swing, which bowed in last month, reportedly sold a respectable 200,000-plus copies of its first issue. Magazines like this can be a god-send, says Goldhersz, because they allow advertisers 'to tap into the mindset of Generation X and keep up with what's hot and what's not.' The term Generation X was coined because of the difficulty of labelling today's 18-to-30-year-olds. Unlike the baby boomers of the 1970s and the 'me' generation of the 1980s, Generation X seems to older observers to lack strong identifying characteristics. The magazines' editorial content offers some clues to the vagaries of today's youth. Unconventionality is a key feature. James Monk, editor of Monk magazine, for instance, leaves messages calling himself 'The Mad Monk' and can only be reached at various motels across the US. Many of the magazines place as much emphasis on technology as on clothes. They interview bosses of multimedia and software firms, and run articles on microchips, the Internet and virtual reality. Most of them attract a great deal of technology advertising, along with more predictable ads for clothing, music and entertainment. Who Cares shows yet another side of Generation X: it is targeted at young volunteer workers. The magazines may not work for all advertisers, some of which may well stick to tried-and-true outlets like MTV and Sports Illustrated. But many advertisers seem happy to have found a new way of communicating with such a huge number of consumers.</p>

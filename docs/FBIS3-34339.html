In a message last night, she  said that observance of the strike from the coastal regions of  Karachi and Gwadar to the blood-soaked Anantnag in occupied  Kashmir was aimed as a reminder of the Kashmiris' basic right  and to assert that the Kashmiris are not alone in their just  struggle. She expressed confidence that the strike will force  world public opinion to realize once again that it will not be  in the interests of the world community to ignore the issue of  Jammu and Kashmir.    Referring to the struggle of the Kashmiri people, the prime  minister said that the strike was a part of the government's  policy to get the Kashmir issue resolved in accordance with UN  resolutions. She said that this was the strategy under which she  traveled to Geneva to address the UN Human Rights Commission  where she raised the Kashmir issue. Ms. Benazir Bhutto said  that the strike and her address to the UN Human Rights  Commission have helped highlight the Kashmir issue at the global  level. She said that the peaceful proposals presented by  Pakistan in accordance with international law are responded to  with threats of war. We cannot be browbeaten by these threats,  she added.    The prime minister said that some Indian leaders have  started  criticizing her personal life. She does not care for this  criticism because she prefers the Kashmiris' right to  self-determination over anything else, she added. Prime  Minister Ms. Benazir Bhutto said that all such activities point  to India's bewilderment. She said that we still favor a  peaceful solution of the Kashmir issue and believe that peace  cannot be achieved without providing justice. The prime minister  said that Pakistan still wishes India to hold talks to resolve  the Kashmir issue. She urged India to take steps to peacefully  resolve the Kashmir problem in accordance with international law.    Prime Minister Bhutto said Pakistan will continue to extend  diplomatic, moral, and political support to the Kashmiri  brethren until India holds talks with Pakistan. She said that  by showing solidarity with the Kashmiris, Pakistan has proven  that Pakistanis and Kashmiris have the same soul. She said that  world public opinion has started taking note of Indian brutal  atrocities in occupied Kashmir. Indian propaganda that the  freedom struggle in Kashmir depends on Pakistan has been  exposed, she added.</p>

			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / Court action over Harrods blocked AN ACTION for damages in the High Court by Lonrho, the international trading group, and Mr Tiny Rowland, its chief executive, alleging a dirty tricks campaign by the Fayed brothers during the row over the ownership of Harrods, the London department store, was yesterday ordered to be struck out. Mr Justice Macpherson said the action, launched last year, was another round in the 'prolonged public warfare with no holds barred' over the Fayeds' acquisition of the House of Fraser stores group. If the action were allowed to go ahead it would inevitably involve raking over the whole dispute with 'mud slung in all directions', Mr Justice Macpherson said. Lonrho and Mr Rowland were ordered to pay the costs of House of Fraser's application to have the action struck out. Lonrho was refused leave to appeal but its lawyers said later there were good grounds for appeal and further moves would be considered. The action sought damages and an injunction in respect of an alleged conspiracy by brothers Mohammed and Ali Al Fayed to injure Lonrho and Mr Rowland. The main figure in the conspiracy allegations, Miss Francesca Pollard, was said to have been used as a 'tool' by the Fayeds in a 'long-running campaign of vilification', with her main target being Mr Rowland personally. The judge said that, 'in a an unpleasant twist', Miss Pollard had gone over to the Lonrho camp in the summer of 1991. He said that, over the past six years, Lonrho and Mr Rowland had been intent on discrediting the Fayeds and had spared no expense. But the Fayeds themselves were not 'lily-white' and were prepared to 'descend to the depths of vulgarity'. The judge said he was 'sceptical' of Lonrho's claim for damages and 'even more sceptical' of its claim for an injunction. Neither remedy was likely to be available to them. Mr Justice Macpherson said: 'I fail to see why such a public, unpleasant and vitriolic vendetta should be allowed to be aired in court'.</p>

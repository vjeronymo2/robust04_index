			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / Finance house seeks Monktonhall mine stake The future of Monktonhall colliery, the deep mine near Edinburgh which is leased from British Coal by a miners' consortium, may now depend on negotiations with Waverley Mining Finance, a quoted mining finance house, James Buxton writes. Mr Willie McLucas, investment manager for Edinburgh-based Waverley, is negotiating a 49 per cent stake in Monktonhall Mineworkers, in which 167 miners have each invested Pounds 10,000. Last month the miners overwhelmingly rejected a takeover offer from RJB Mining under which each would have received Pounds 1,000 for his shares. They had been warned that if they refused RJB's offer the company was likely to go into liquidation, failing an alternative offer. RJB Mining had planned to invest Pounds 3m to make the mine profitable, though it is believed that a smaller investment would also be effective. A deal might involve Monktonhall Mineworkers issuing new shares to Waverley, entailing dilution of the miners' stakes. Waverley would also hope to secure finance from the Department of Trade and Industry and from Lothian Regional Council, as RJB Mining had intended. Waverley, which has a market capitalisation of Pounds 4.25m, has mainly invested in mining ventures in the US and Australia.</p>

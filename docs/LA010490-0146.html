			<p><P> January 4, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY DIGEST: COMPTON;  </P> <P> COUNCIL FAILS TO DECIDE ON RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT  </P> <P> With one council member absent, the City Council could not agree Tuesday night  on whether to allow a developer to build 49 apartment units along with 30  single-family houses near the intersection of Wilmington Avenue and Compton  Boulevard. Some residents and two council members, Patricia Moore and Maxcy  Filer, adamantly oppose the apartment portion of the development, saying  Compton must concentrate on single-family housing to attract middle-income  residents.  </P> <P> Apartments, according to their detractors, bring low-income renters for whom  Compton cannot afford to provide services.  </P> <P> Mayor Walter Tucker and Councilwoman Jane Robbins voted to uphold the Planning  Commission's decision to allow Madison Avenue Properties to build the  apartments along with the houses. Councilwoman Bernice Woods was absent because  of illness and the council said it wants to vote on the issue again when  everyone is present.  </P> <P> The developer is Evan Williams, owner of Dalton Construction Co., which has  worked on several city projects.  </P></p>

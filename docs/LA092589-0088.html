			<p><P> September 25, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK: WHEN THE BILLS PILE UP, THE PAYOFF CAN BE FUN  </P> <P> Covering state government has more than its share of dull moments.  </P> <P> Sometimes you find yourself in mind-numbing committee meetings, forced to  perfect the fine art of cuticle analysis until the lawmakers get around to an  important issue affecting Orange County. Then you scribble away furiously to  get down all the nuances of the animated debate, only to slump despondently in  your chair when they vote to put everything off.  </P> <P> Then there is the end of the legislative session in mid-September, when  lawmakers must put up or shut up before they pack their bags and leave town for  the rest of the year.  </P> <P> This year, the deadline was midnight of Sept. 15 for a bill to be passed by  both houses of the Legislature. All those (and there were a great many) not  passed by that time would be considered dead or held in abeyance until next  year.  </P> <P> That kind of pressure -- combined with an overindulgence in caffeine, lack of  sleep, the fear of failure and the exuberance of politics -- prompted  legislators during the days leading up to their deadline to engage in the kind  of antics that more than compensate for the boring times.  </P> <P> This year, for instance, there was the momentous showdown on whether the  Republicans or the Democrats would control the large shutters on the windows in  the Assembly.  </P> <P> The Democrats, who sit on the side of the chamber with an inside wall, wanted  to record the crucial closing minutes of the Legislature on videotape. The only  problem was that the late-afternoon sunlight coming through the windows near  the Republicans -- and, specifically, behind the press desk occupied by The  Times -- was ruining the cinematographic effect.  </P> <P> So one Democratic lawmaker came over into enemy territory to close up the  shutters, shoving this reporter aside in his zeal to achieve an artistic  effect.  </P> <P> No sooner had he left, however, than the Republicans launched a counterattack,  sending Assemblyman Curt Pringle (R-Garden Grove) to fling open the shutters  and let the sunshine back into state government.  </P> <P> "We don't want their pictures of us coming out," explained the politically  astute Pringle.  </P> <P> There were more theatrics later that evening as the Assembly, charging ahead in  overdrive, took up a number of bills in quick succession.  </P> <P> A legislator stood up to support a measure, beginning a sentence with, "I agree  with (Assemblyman) Steve Peace. . . ."  </P> <P> Whereupon Peace (D-La Mesa), considered something of a maverick, threw up his  hands in mock shock, fell backside first to the floor and played dead for two  minutes -- with other legislators and reporters being careful to walk around  his outstretched arms.  </P> <P> That day in the more temperate Senate chamber -- often referred to as the  "gentlemen's house" -- tempers were flaring during an unusually emotional  display over Orange County's jail tax measure. Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport  Beach) was trying her darndest to get the bill through. Slyly, she took  advantage of a little-known parliamentary procedure to surprise her opponents  and move the measure off the floor.  </P> <P> Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles), who opposed her bill, had put the measure "on  call" -- essentially a parliamentary holding action used to buy time and maybe  change a few votes. It is considered a common courtesy in the Senate that the  legislator who places a bill "on call" also be the one to remove it.  </P> <P> But that's not what the rules say. Any senator can "lift" a call, which is  exactly what Bergeson did shortly after debate on the bill. Before a stunned  Torres could react, the bill was officially approved and sent along to the  Assembly.  </P> <P> Bergeson's ploy sparked shouting and foot-stomping by Torres and Sen. Bill  Lockyer (D-Hayward), who also wanted the measure stalled. Lockyer began yelling  across the ornate chamber at Senate President Pro Tempore David A. Roberti  (D-Los Angeles) for not intervening to stop Bergeson's procedural move.  </P> <P> "David Roberti, you should be ashamed of yourself!" Lockyer shouted. "What is  happening here?"  </P> <P> "Would you not do that in front of people?" Roberti asked, casting his eyes  toward nearby staff members and reporters.  </P> <P> But there was no stopping Lockyer, who was outraged over the parliamentary  rulings Sen. Ralph Dills (D-Gardena), chair of Senate deliberations, was making  on the last day of the session.  </P> <P> "That's the only way I can get you to respond!" Lockyer raged. "That madman  (Dills) is going wacko!"  </P> <P> Sometimes, it's anything but dull.  </P></p>

			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / Dollar continues its cautious recovery The dollar continued its cautious recovery on foreign exchanges yesterday, helped by supportive comments from Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US treasury secretary. Earlier in the day the US currency had been buoyed by wild rumours, later denied by US defence officials, that the US had invaded Haiti. It also took heart from firmer international bond markets. 'We're going to continue to be in accord with the Federal Reserve as far as their objectives to see that we have sustained growth with low inflation, and work toward a strong dollar,' Mr Bentsen told reporters. The dollar closed in London at DM1.5457 from DM1.5383 on Wednesday. It finished at Y98.28 against the yen from Y98.155. During US trading it touched DM1.5560 and Y98.65, before easing back. Traders said the dollar's bounce back was being supported by technical factors, but were not prepared to say that the recent bear trend had been reversed. Earlier the dollar had received some muted support from Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank president. He told a lunch in Frankfurt that 'the world economy has an interest in an internally and an externally stable dollar.' He made clear, though, that 'the prime responsibility for the dollar's strength lies in the US itself. The thesis current at the beginning of the seventies - it's our currency but your problem - is clearly too short-sighted,' he said. The economic data that emerged in the US provided a confused message for the dollar. June retail sales were in line with market expectations, and May sales were revised down, providing no evidence that a Fed policy tightening is required. The White House mid-session budget review, however, said the economy was approaching full capacity faster than expected. More encouraging for the dollar was the recovery in US and European bond markets. One of the factors behind D-Mark strength - and dollar weakness - in recent months has been investors selling European bonds and putting the receipts into D-Mark deposits. The recovery in bond markets suggests this trend may be being reversed. 'If this is a turn in the bond markets it should be positive for the dollar,' said Mr Chris Turner, currency strategist at the securities house BZW in London. 'Anything that takes upward pressure off the D-Mark would have to be good for the dollar.' Dealers report that some investors are now starting to see good medium-term value in the dollar at its current levels. But they warn that it may still fall further against the yen, especially if the US continues its tough attitude towards Japan on trade issues. Mr Jeffrey Garten, the US under secretary of Commerce, said in Tokyo that although the rhetoric had been 'toned down,' US strategy had not changed. Mr Garten said 'significant obstacles' remained in the way of progress. See Markets, Currencies, Second Section</p>

			<p><P> May 16, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> NEW YORK;  </P> <P> LOVE CANAL HOMES DECLARED HABITABLE  </P> <P> Environmental Protection Agency Administrator William K. Reilly upheld a health  study that found about 250 homes near the Love Canal toxic waste dump are safe  to live in. Despite opposition from environmental groups, Reilly said he backs  a four-year habitability study that led state officials to approve the  resettlement near Niagara Falls, N.Y. Some of the homes formally go on the  market in about six weeks. State officials said, however, that buyers would get  no guarantees that problems with PCBs, dioxin and other toxic chemicals would  not recur.  </P></p>

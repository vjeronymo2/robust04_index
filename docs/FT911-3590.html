			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / International Company News: ITT starts year with 9.4% fall to Dollars 229m ITT, the US conglomerate with interests ranging from defence to insurance, reported a 9.4 per cent fall in first-quarter profits, to Dollars 229m after tax. Earnings per share also fell, from Dollars 1.77 to Dollars 1.7, but, in both cases, comparisons were distorted by one-off items. On the one hand, the first quarter of 1991 took in portfolio gains of Dollars 35m - or 26 cents a share - mainly at ITT Hartford, the insurance arm. This contrasted with portfolio gains of Dollars 4m, or 3 cents a share, in the corresponding period a year earlier. On the other hand, the first quarter of 1990 was boosted by an after-tax gain of Dollars 47m from the sale of the stake in Alcatel Alsthom. ITT said that without this item, net income in the first quarter would have improved by 18 per cent. ITT said that its electronic components business improved on higher volumes and better efficiencies at ITT semiconductors. ITT Defence also had a better quarter due to more favourable margins on certain contracts and despite lower sales. The fluid technology business was 'slightly down' but ITT automotive and the group's forest products division both saw sharper falls.</p>

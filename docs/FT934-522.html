			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Hong Kong: flawed perception Sir, The leased territories in Hong Kong must be returned to the landlord, the People's Republic of China. If Britain feels morally responsible for the sub-tenants, the people of Hong Kong, then it should provide another place of abode for those of them who do not wish to live directly under the rules laid down by the landlord. Any other action is an admission of flawed moral perceptions. J W Hoe, 17 Queen's Road, Singapore 1026</p>

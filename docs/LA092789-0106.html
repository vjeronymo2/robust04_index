			<p><P> September 27, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 2 SOUTHERN BANKS PLAN $4.7-BILLION MERGER  </P> <P> Citizens &amp; Southern Corp. and Sovran Financial Corp. announced a  $4.7-billion merger Tuesday that will create the nation's 14th-largest banking  company.  </P> <P> C&amp;S, based in Atlanta, and Sovran, based in Norfolk, Va., will have total  assets of $47 billion and almost 1,000 offices in seven states from Maryland to  Florida. Under a newly formed holding company called Avantor Financial Corp.,  the two banks plan to maintain dual headquarters and retain current management.  </P> <P> The merger comes five months after C&amp;S fought off a takeover bid by North  Carolina's NCNB Corp. Unlike that proposal, the C&amp;S-Sovran deal is a  friendly merger.  </P></p>

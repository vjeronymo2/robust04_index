			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [RITZAUS BUREAU report: "Faorese to Election"] </F>   [Text] (Torshavn) -- There will be an early election in the  Faeroe Islands. The Faeroese will cast their ballots in early  July to vote 32 candidates to the Lagting. On Thursday [19 May]  a majority in the Lagting voted to order Lagmand [prime  minister] Marita Petersen to call an election on the  crisis-ridden islands as soon as possible.    The resolution in the Lagting means that election day will  come between 4 and 7 July.    Petersen thought it unfortunate that an election is being  called now, since she would have preferred action to have been  taken first on the the approximately 40 important bills recently  sent to the Lagting.    The Faeroese ruling coalition recently lost its majority,  which gave the opportunity for the large opposition Sambands  Party to submit a motion that an election be held as soon as  possible.</p>

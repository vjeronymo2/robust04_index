			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / Iceland forced to devalue krona Iceland yesterday devalued the krona, by 7.5 per cent, the country's second devaluation in eight months, writes Christopher Brown-Humes in Stockholm. The move follows a sharp fall in fish prices this year and a government decision to limit the country's cod catch in the face of declining stocks. The Icelandic economy is heavily dependent on fishing, with cod accounting for 30 per cent of exports. The devaluation is relative to a currency basket, in which the European currency unit has a 76 per cent weighting, the dollar 18 per cent, and the yen 6 per cent.</p>

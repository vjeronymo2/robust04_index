			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Ivan Zasurskiy report in the "Perspective" column under </F> general headline: "Yegor Gaydar Has Made His Choice, and So Has  Boris Yeltsin. The Game of Radical Economic Reforms in Russia  Has Ended for the Time Being"]    [Text] Yegor Gaydar's resignation is in no way capable of  changing the character of the economic policy pursued by Viktor  Chernomyrdin, because the incumbent government had none even  after Gaydar's comeback. The fact is that it has been more than  six months now that the reformist theoretical mood has been  pushed into the background relative to the cabinet's ongoing  fire-fighting activity. When, in responding to questions about  his possible appointment to replace Gaydar, Grigoriy Yavlinskiy  described the government as "Soviet," it was not his intention  to use profanity. Simply, the "Soviet" government has always  been a secondary organ with respect to the ideological apparatus  structures in Staraya Ploshchad. And now, when the government  has meekly moved into the White House (while the president's  administration went into Staraya Ploshchad), everything has been  put into place. It is another matter whether there is a  perception about the need for an economic policy in Staraya  Ploshchad.    From the start, Yegor Gaydar claimed starring roles in the  cabinet. After the election defeat Viktor Chernomyrdin demoted  Gaydar to the "second" first vice premier. The formal sharing  of the status of first deputy with Soskovets, who can be defined  as the cabinet's industry leader, effectively deprived the  ex-premier of the opportunity to influence the government's  conduct of any economic policy. In this context the mention of  the ambitious and rational Yavlinskiy as a replacement for the  ideologically reformist decoration can only evoke a smile.  Although it needs to be recognized that if the EPICenter head  had no substantial material and ideological basic structure, he  would have had to consent.    What then substitutes for economic policy in the present  cabinet of ministers? Here one should go back to the trinity  that featured in Chernomyrdin's speech in parliament.  Apparently, this is social policy as a method of preserving and  multiplying the well-being of the (entire) people; the second,  that is to say, "anti-shock" wind for the reforms; and support  and assistance for producers. Naturally these are guidelines for  practical people, not a concept for long-term development. The  practical peoples' weight in the Russian cabinet of ministers is  so substantial, however, that the interests of industrial,  agrarian, and financial lobbies will acquire the character of  economic policy in the very near future. At the same time, since  Gaydar's pressure on the president has after all led to his  effective resignation, the entire spectrum of economic policy  options will be presented in parliament. It is clear that such  a scenario can result in a curious lineup in the system of power  distribution. The government, while remaining a purely working  body, will be implementing political decisions by the  president's administration and economic decisions by parliament.    Radical reform advocates will consider such a scheme typical  for a third-world country. It is necessary to admit, however,  that an alternative to this at the present stage is only a  reformist dictatorship, and therefore many, many upheavals.    The evolution of the above scheme on the contrary  contributes  to political stability, which is necessary to overcome many  complexes of the post-socialist power, including the  irrationality of the politicized populace. Specifically this  will mean for the Russian economy the maintaining of inflation  at its current level with the haphazard flourishing or  degradation of various branches. Until a new perception has  come about of what is a real economic reform for Russia.</p>

			<p>920309 FT  09 MAR 92 / Observer: Insider spoils Perhaps City villains should take a tip from the world's drug traffickers. If you have to get arrested and thrown in jail, Zurich is the place to have it happen. The prisons are nice, and you get paid Pounds 7.60 a day net for your labours. South American drug-mules love it, it seems, because they can make more money there than at home. With an average sentence of 38 months, they can stash away a nifty Pounds 8,850. Moreover, they can ship it home without hindrance because Swiss law forbids anyone to make a claim on the money. All this, plus the cost of prosecution which is paid by the state, has been getting on the nerves of Marcel Bebie, public prosecutor in the district of Bulach which, being adjacent to Zurich airport, has to handle all the mules caught on their way to the city's big drug market. Bebie suggests the level of jail pay should be related to the cost of living in the criminal's country. Then only the Japanese would want to come.</p>

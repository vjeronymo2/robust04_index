			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ake Ekdahl: "Male Voters the Party's Base"] </F>   [Text] No political party is as male dominated in the  electorate as New Democracy [NYD]. Nearly two-thirds, or 62  percent, of NYD's voters were men. The party had 9 percent men  and 5 percent women in its debut election in 1991. A large  number of them were young LO [National Federation of Trade  Unions] men in large cities.    Since the election, 53 percent of these voters have left New  Democracy, according to Skop's April poll. Of those who are left  and of the new arrivals 2.7 percent are women and 6.5 percent  men. Most are between 18 and 34 years old. Many unemployed  support the NYD.    From now on this party will be governed by three women. That  is a Swedish record in female representation at the top of the  party, and without sex quotas as well.  <H5>  New Expectations </H5>   More women in leading positions is usually regarded as a  guarantee of altered values in politics. In the case of New  Democracy that thesis is being put to a difficult test before  the election. New Democracy is the driving force behind several  issues that are usually described as typically "hard" or male  and where women are generally more cautious. There will be  expectations for the NYD troika to outline a female profile on  issues such as European Union [EU] membership, nuclear power, no  speed limits on the roads, the Oresund bridge, and no to the  six-hour workday, which have in fact become issues separating  the sexes.    NYD's female government could become an alternative in the  election for working women who are able to identify with  ambitious and intellectual Harriet Colliander, with Siv  Bjorkman, an acknowledged skillful negotiator, and self-employed  businesswoman Gunilla Anstrup-Persson.    If New Democracy is to manage a new parliamentary contract,  these three must gather an entirely new electorate among  dissatisfied women a bit on the way into their careers, instead  of the former Social Democrats and Conservatives who in a  "personal election" voted Bert Karlsson and Ian Wachtmeister  into the Riksdag. New Democracy can lure these women primarily  from the Conservatives, the Liberal Party, and among those who  have not been voting.    The course shifts that could take place in day-to-day  politics will depend more on how dominant Bert Karlsson becomes  in the parliamentary group. Ian Wachtmeister intends to stay in  the Riksdag all spring; he wants to keep his place on the  Finance Committee and that will continue the internal duels  within the group between the two factions behind the enemies  Bert and Ian.    Harriet Colliander is to hold her watchful hand over these  two fighting cocks.  <H5>  New Leadership </H5>   Her leadership will be completely different from her  predecessor's. Wachtmeister ended up in conflict with both the  parliamentary group and party organizations because he lacked  patience with the political haggling. He tried to manage the  party the way a company director manages his enterprises. To  Wachtmeister marketing politics was the same as selling a new  product.    If the customers/voters do not want to buy what is offered,  the activity must be closed down, according to Wachtmeister.    Such a proposal was met with boos from the meeting in  Vasteras.    It also shows that Ian Wachtmeister does not have serious  plans for starting a new party and joining the other political  wild cards in this already splintered Riksdag.</p>

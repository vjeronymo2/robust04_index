			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / Receivers at Lancer Boss announce more job losses Receivers for Lancer Boss yesterday announced another 50 redundancies at the lift-truck maker's Leighton Buzzard plant in Bedfordshire, reducing the workforce to about 700. The cuts follow 19 made on April 10, two days after Mr Allan Griffiths and Mr Scott Barnes of Grant Thornton were appointed administrative receivers of Lancer Boss's UK operations. Mr Griffiths also announced that he had reached agreement with the management of Jungheinrich, the Hamburg-based lift-truck maker, on a continuing trading relationship between Lancer Boss and Steinbock Boss. Steinbock Boss is Lancer's former German unit, which Jungheinrich acquired from the German receiver last Thursday. Lancer Boss and Steinbock Boss are closely related and a trading relationship is crucial to Mr Griffiths' attempts to sell Lancer Boss as a going concern. Mr Griffiths said the trading relationship between the two companies was 'essentially unaltered'. 'Since that trading relationship has traditionally accounted for approximately 50 per cent of Lancer Boss sales, I am confident that this will offer substantial comfort to customers, suppliers and potential buyers of the business,' he said. He said he planned to begin negotiations to sell the business as a going concern once prospective purchasers had researched the business and assessed its value. On Wednesday, Mr Bob Bischof, chairman of Jungheinrich in the UK, said the German company expected to be ready to make a bid for Lancer Boss by the middle of next week. 'We will be looking seriously at acquiring it - that is our intention,' he said. Mr Griffiths said yesterday's redundancies followed a comprehensive assessment, in consultation with the existing management team, of the likely demand in the marketplace. Those made redundant were from a cross-section of the workforce.</p>

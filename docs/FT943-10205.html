			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Great Southern in talks over third party bid Loewen Group, a Vancouver-based funeral home and cemetery operator, disclosed yesterday that it had been approached by Great Southern Group to help fend off an unwelcome takeover bid from Service Corporation International of the US. Loewen is SCI's main rival in North America. It operates more than 600 funeral homes and 95 cemeteries across the US, Canada, Puerto Rico and Mexico. SCI has made a Pounds 99.1m tender offer for Great Southern, but has so far been rebuffed by members of the Field family who control the UK funerals company. Loewen said yesterday that it 'has been invited and is meeting with' Great Southern and JD Field &amp; Sons, the trust which holds the family's shares. A team from Loewen is presently in the UK for talks with the UK group. 'We'll decide whether or not to make an offer when we've finished the discussions,' Loewen said. Great Southern, which is the UK's biggest crematorium operator, has indicated that an offer from Loewen or any other white knight will be at a higher price than SCI's latest bid of 680p per share. SCI is also offering 271p for Great Southern's convertible stock. The Houston-based company earlier this week boosted its stake in Great Southern from 3 per cent to 29 per cent, making it Great Southern's second-biggest shareholder. Its latest offer expires on Aug 30. But the UK Takeover Panel yesterday ruled that SCI would be allowed to extend the closing date for its offer to match the timetable of any competing bid. Loewen has mushroomed since its formation in the early 1980s, mainly by buying funeral homes in the US. It spent Dollars 666m on US acquisitions in the five years to 1993.</p>

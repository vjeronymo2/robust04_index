			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / Airlines step up drive for EC control system EUROPE'S national airlines yesterday called for 'a quick political solution' to the growing problem of congestion in the skies. Mr Giovanni Bisignani, chairman of the Association of European Airlines (AEA) and chief executive of Alitalia, attacked Europe's failure to establish a single harmonised system of air traffic control. Europe's 54 air traffic control centres use 31 different technical systems, none compatible with the others. The computer hardware for the systems comes from 18 different manufacturers and employs 70 different programming languages. At an AEA forum in Brussels, Mr Bisignani said the fragmented system of national jurisdiction over European airspace had doubled delays over the last six years. Overloading of the European air traffic control (ATC) network has already meant that dozens of flights have been delayed or cancelled this summer. The International Air Transport Association (Iata) and Eurocontrol, the Brussels-based government backed air traffic control centre, are developing an improved ATC scheme for Europe. But the new system will not be ready until 1995 at the earliest and Iata warned last month that a serious failure of Europe's ATC might occur this summer, leaving hundreds of aircraft and crews stranded at the wrong airports. Mr Bisignani yesterday launched a pan-European information campaign aimed at shifting the blame for flight delays and cancellations to the national and European authorities. Transport ministers from the European Civil Aviation Conference (ECAC) met in March to consider ways of improving the air traffic control system. But the AEA says ECAC's harmonisation programme will still lead to 'a complicated and very inefficient managerial structure' because it will try to preserve national authorities' sovereignty over their airspace.</p>

			<p>940307 FT  07 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: French in no position to criticise US Sir, Loud French protests over president Clinton's successful efforts to encourage Saudi purchases of US civilian aircraft struck me as being a tad on the hypocritical side ('French attack Clinton on aircraft sales', March 2). For more than a decade as a senior economics official of the US State Department, I observed president Mitterrand and a galaxy of other Europe leaders on sales missions to the Middle East and elsewhere. I noted efforts to link state-to-state political favours (or sometimes threats) to national commercial interests, including aircraft sales, oil concessions, arms deals, and construction projects. The US government occasionally protested against this behaviour at an official level. For years we quietly warned that we could also play this game, and powerfully so, if others continued to practice. President Clinton has just demonstrated the truth of that observation. Commercial deals and international politics ought to be separated. Perhaps this is an unattainable ideal. But in any case, under prevailing realities and current widespread practices, the French have no grounds for complaining about president Clinton's efforts on aircraft sales other than the fact that, on this occasion, he successfully trumped president Mitterrand's ace. Richard McCormack, under secretary of state for economic affairs 1989-91, 516 Watergate South, 700 New Hampshire Avenue, NW Washington DC 20037.</p>

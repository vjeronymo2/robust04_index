			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / Former prime minister tells of Y10m gift THE government of Mr Kiichi Miyazawa was greatly embarrassed yesterday by the return parliamentary appearance of a former prime minister, Mr Zenko Suzuki, who told of his dealings with a bankrupt leisure club developer and admitted to receiving Y10m (Pounds 44,600) from an indicted politician for services rendered. For the Japanese public, the polite grilling of Mr Suzuki, 81, who retired as MP two years ago, highlighted the unsavoury, though not illegal, contacts cultivated by politicians seeking to fund networks of influence in the ruling Liberal Democratic party (LDP). Opposition parties had demanded that Mr Suzuki and another senior LDP member, Mr Jun Shiozaki, 76, appear to answer questions about their dealings with Kyowa Corporation, a now bankrupt property and steel company, and links to Mr Fumio Abe, an LDP member recently indicted on charges of accepting Y90m in bribes from Kyowa. The opposition had delayed the passage of Japan's budget to force the LDP to produce Mr Suzuki. It was suggested that he could not appear because of ill-health, but a magazine picture of Mr Suzuki clearly enjoying a round of golf prompted the ruling party to insist that the elder statesman explain how he came to be honorary chairman of a never-completed Kyowa leisure club. Mr Suzuki admitted that Mr Abe, on the announcement of his much cherished appointment to the cabinet in 1989, had given him a brown envelope, though the former leader said he was surprised to find that it contained Y10m from his grateful associate. He suggested that he did not want the money, though he kept it 'on behalf of' Mr Abe, returning the same amount to him in November of last year. Mr Shiozaki expressed similar surprise at receiving Y20m from Kyowa after he had intervened on the company's behalf to settle a dispute with Marubeni, the famed trading house. A stern Mr Suzuki, who led the country from 1980 to 1982, denied allegations that he had received another Y100m from Kyowa after he had agreed to become honorary chairman of its planned club. He also said that a widely reported comment that 'you can't question me, I'm a former prime minister' was wrongly attributed to him and explained that he attended a Kyowa factory opening because 'I wanted to visit my grandchildren' in the same district. The Justice Ministry said yesterday investigations into the Kyowa case had concluded, and no further charges would be laid. However, the scandal has shaken Mr Miyazawa, as it has centred on political fund raising by senior officials within his LDP faction. Meanwhile, a Japanese court yesterday gave a suspended two and a half year sentence to Mr Fujio Tashiro, a former member of the opposition Komeito (Clean Government party), after finding him guilty of accepting a Y10m bribe from an association of gravel and stone shippers.</p>

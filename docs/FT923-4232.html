			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Halls Homes back in the black As foreshadowed in the annual statement Halls Homes &amp; Gardens, the USM-quoted manufacturer of conservatories, garden buildings and home improvement products, moved back into the black in the first half of 1992. Pre-tax profits of Pounds 529,000 compared with losses of Pounds 2.46m 12 months earlier, a figure which included exceptional provisions of Pounds 1.03m, and with a deficit of Pounds 7.53m for the full 1991 year. However, trading in July and August had been below expectations and directors warned that it was now 'likely the normally weaker second half will generate losses that will exceed the profits of the first half'. First half turnover rose by Pounds 1m to Pounds 12.7m and earnings per share emerged at 1.1p (losses 5.17p). There is again no interim dividend.</p>

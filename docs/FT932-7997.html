			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / Danish tax rates cut as reward for treaty vote: Fringe group blamed for riot; growth package to boost economy THE DANISH government yesterday brushed aside violent demonstrations sparked by Tuesday's referendum result endorsing the European Community's Maastricht treaty, and as a reward for the Yes vote announced a programme to stimulate economic growth and employment. The riots in an inner city district of Copenhagen left 11 demonstrators wounded by police gunfire and 26 policemen injured. They were said by officials to have been the worst peacetime disturbances in Denmark. The government blamed a small fringe group of militant squatters. Yesterday, the area returned quickly to normal, but local residents were braced in case of further disturbances last night. The government insisted the attacks did not represent the feelings of the vast majority of No voters. Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, the Social Democratic prime minister, condemned the riots as an isolated incident and told parliament the government would slash marginal income tax rates to bring them closer into line with the rest of the EC. State investment plans to push up growth in gross domestic product from under 1 per cent this year to almost 3.5 per cent in 1994 would also be brought forward. At the same time, Denmark's central bank cut the official discount rate to 8.25 per cent from 9.25 per cent and commercial banks announced similar reductions in their lending and deposit rates, which had been held artificially high because of uncertainty over the Maastricht vote. Business reaction was positive. The Copenhagen stock market, which had risen strongly in expectation of a Yes vote, put on a further 2.30 points to close at 303.89. The tax cuts are aimed at galvanising other EC member states to rally behind a beefed-up economic growth package ahead of next month's EC summit in Copenhagen. The Danish presidency of the EC, working with the European Commission, wants member states to consider fresh measures to stimulate growth, mainly through shifting to capital spending, making the labour market more flexible, and other fiscal incentives to create jobs. The growth package and the unemployment crisis in the EC are top of the agenda at a two-day meeting of EC finance ministers in Kolding, Denmark, which starts tomorrow. In Brussels yesterday, Commission officials hailed the Danish endorsement of the Maastricht treaty in Tuesday's second referendum as giving a 'psychological lift' to the Community after several months of drift. The positive vote has given new impetus to the Danish presidency. Danish officials vowed to press for agreement on issues such as a new trade liberalisation package for eastern Europe before Denmark hands over the presidency to Belgium on July 1. The Danes approved Maastricht by a margin of 56.8 per cent in favour to 43.2 per cent against, on an 86.2 per cent turnout, reversing the rejection of the treaty in a poll last June. Mr Rasmussen said the signal from Danish voters was that Europe's political leaders must close the gap that had opened between them and their electorates over Maastricht by adopting pragmatic policies which tackled problems such as unemployment. 'We have to be more engaged', he said. He said the government's economic package would bring the jobless rate down from 12 per cent at present to about 11 per cent in 1994. Marginal income tax rates would be cut from next year to a band of 38 to 58 per cent, compared with 52 to 68 per cent at present. The tax cuts will eventually be financed by 'green' taxes on petrol, electricity, heating, water consumption and, among other things, plastic bags.

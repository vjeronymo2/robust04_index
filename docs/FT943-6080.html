			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / Danish Elections: Denmark set for close poll race The Danish government's decision to call a general election on September 21 has put into place the final piece in an unprecedented series of elections and referendums in the Nordic region this autumn. The Danish vote will come just three days after Sweden's general election and will be followed in October and November by referendums in Finland, Sweden and Norway on European Union entry. As a member of the EU for two decades, Denmark is playing a bit part in the Nordic drama, but its election will be hard fought. Voters have an unusually clear choice between left and right and opinion polls suggest that at present the result is too close to call. Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, Social Democrat prime minister, will be hoping that an expected strong swing to the Social Democrats in Sweden will be mirrored in Denmark. He leads a four-party centre-left majority coalition, but opinion polls suggest its two small centre party members may not win the necessary 2 per cent of the vote to regain election to the Folketing (parliament). They hold the balance between the main left- and right-wing blocs, the Centre Democrats and the Christian People's Party - hence the starker confrontation than usual between left and right. The left-wing alternative (known to its opponents as 'the red cabinet') is a new Social Democrat-dominated government in coalition with the Radical Liberals, a social-liberal party which is a member of the present coalition. An SDP-Radical government would have to rely for its majorities in the Folketing on support from the left-wing Socialist People's Party (SPP). Fewer inhibitions about high government spending, and an aggressive environmental policy would be among the hallmarks of a government which comes came under SPP influence - although its more extreme demands would be strongly opposed by the Radical Liberals. The right-wing alternative ('the black cabinet' say its opponents) would be a coalition of the Liberal and Conservative parties, which formed the core of the non-socialist governments which held office under Mr Poul Schluter from 1982 to January 1993. It offers curbs on welfare programmes, tight control of government spending, a more favourable income tax regime and measures to make the labour market more flexible by reducing high unemployment benefits and tightening eligibility rules for benefit. This government would require the support of the populist right-wing Progress party, formerly an anarchic maverick shunned by mainstream parties. However, it has now become sufficiently respectable for the Liberals and Conservatives to be openly proposing a government allied with it. In the economic debate, both right- and left-wing blocs are claiming credit for Denmark's present relative success. The economy is set to grow this year by about 4 per cent. There are large surpluses on the balance of payments accounts, low inflation, and a budget deficit of modest proportions - about 5.5 per cent of gross domestic product. Unemployment is around 12 per cent but beginning to decline. Mr Rasmussen is claiming the credit, but the opposition insist it was their policies between 1982 and 1993 which stabilised the economy and laid the basis for recovery. With Mr Schluter replaced as Conservative party leader by the lesser known Mr Hans Engell, the right-wing charge is now being led by Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, the Liberal leader who was foreign minister from 1982 to 1993. The Liberals have performed better than the Conservatives in opinion polls and this year's European parliament election, which makes Mr Ellemann-Jensen favourite to lead a Liberal-Conservative government. However, a clear-cut government of either left or right is far from assured. Voters may yet reprieve the Centre Democrats and the Christian People's party. That would be in keeping with a long tradition by which small parties of the centre call the tune in brokering a coalition and the political choices are fudged.</p>

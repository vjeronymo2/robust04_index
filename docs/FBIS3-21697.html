			<p>Language: <F P=105> Lithuanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Gintautas Jankauskas: "Drug Routes Run Across </F> Lithuania"]    [Excerpts] RESPUBLIKA has already reported about the  detention of three men last Wednesday [2 February], accused of  keeping and selling drugs. More than a kilogram of opium and  800 grams of marijuana were found on them. These traffickers  are supposed to have arrived in Lithuania from Kyrgyzstan.  [passage omitted]    First of all, the police tried to discover the addressee of  this shipment in Lithuania. Unfortunately, they managed to  learn very little from the detained persons. The latter  pretended immediately that they hardly understood Russian. They  did not have any personal documents. Currently, the detainees  are kept at the Vilnius reception and distribution center where  the police are trying to establish their identity.    The next day after the detention of the people from the  south, employees from the Interior Ministry Division for the  Prevention of Illegal Drug Production and Sale carried out  several actions in cooperation with the Vilnius police. Another  person was detained, and the officials discovered around 600  grams of marijuana and several grams of opium while searching  his apartment. Incidentally, according to specialists, the  opium found in the man's apartment was definitely produced  outside Lithuania--its quality was too high. A policeman's  uniform and several masks were also discovered during the  search. The man is supposed to be a member of a well-organized  gang in Lithuania which engages in drug production and  trafficking. The police refused to provide any details until the  investigation is completed.    While inspecting trains in Kybartai (Vilkaviskis region)  last  Thursday, customs officers confiscated almost five kilograms of  ground poppy heads found on Russian residents V. Gavrilov, O.  Popov, and I. Osipova. [passage omitted]</p>

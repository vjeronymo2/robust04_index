			<p><P> October 14, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> MOZART, RACHMANINOFF PROGRAM AT MUSIC CENTER  </P> <P> The virtue of contrast as an all-sustaining program principle got a severe test  Thursday evening at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion. Andre Previn and the Los  Angeles Philharmonic paired glossy Technicolor romanticism with a sort of flat  brown classicism.  </P> <P> Not, of course, that anyone intended anything quite so drab with Mozart's  Violin Concerto in D, K. 218. There was concertmaster Sidney Weiss giving a  warm, solid, singing account of the solo part. There was Previn, encouraging  brio and balance, and there was the suitably down-sized Philharmonic  contingent, playing blithely if somewhat thickly.  </P> <P> But it never quite meshed into a unified -- let alone compelling -- statement.  In each movement there were notable divergences between Weiss and the band, and  the fitfulness of the finale seemed more a matter of befuddlement than  spontaneity or whimsy.  </P> <P> Weiss brought a self-effacing sincerity and more than ample technical resources  to the task. He challenged himself with a major, stylistically incongruous  cadenza for the first movement, reduced the passage work to etude routine and  spun out a wonderfully connected, genteel cantabile in the middle movement.  </P> <P> The faceless pallor of the Mozart effort seemed more pronounced after  intermission, when Previn and the full orchestra returned with Rachmaninoff's  Second Symphony.  </P> <P> Here was a performance with immediacy and an unanswerable rightness to it --  vast and vivid, yet firmly focused. Previn takes his Rachmaninoff uncut, and  almost convinces us that past impressions of redundant sprawl in the work are  the product of interpretive compromises.  </P> <P> In allowing Rachmaninoff his full say, Previn reveals the sure if idiosyncratic  sense of proportion under the bombast and sentiment. He also provides an  enhancing context for the sudden emotional shifts, suggesting that all the  sound and fury signifies much.  </P> <P> The Philharmonic responded heroically. The playing was cohesive and burnished  throughout the orchestra, attentive to Previn's caressive phrasing and  well-balanced other than in the finale, where the strings were submerged.  </P> <P> The accomplishment was greeted by an apparently almost-unanimous standing  ovation from the large crowd.

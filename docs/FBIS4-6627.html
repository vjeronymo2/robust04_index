			<p>BFN     [Text] Canberra, April 21 (CTK) -- The Czech Republic will  support Australia's effort to become a non-permanent member of  the U.N. Security Council [UNSC], Foreign Minister Josef  Zieleniec told journalists today.    The Czech Republic, currently one of the Security Council  non-permanent members, pledged to support some countries when it  itself was striving for the post, Zieleniec said after he had  met Australian Foreign Minister Gareth Evans.    Australia wants to achieve the post in 1996.</p>

			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: United Biscuits The market's response to UB's sale of its Terry's chocolate business looked churlish. In truth, the 3 per cent drop in UB's shares may have signified little more than profit-taking after a recent flurry. The deal certainly seems shrewd for UB, which has built Terry's into an attractive chocolate business over the past decade. But with just 3 per cent of the UK market, it was a small player facing sticky growth prospects. The exit multiple of almost 23 was tempting. The Pounds 220m proceeds will help reduce UB's gearing to about 50 per cent. It will also give UB flexibility in competing for Royal Brands' biscuit business in Spain. What Terry's buyer, Philip Morris, hopes to achieve is most intriguing. Its ownership of Jacobs Suchard and its torrential cash flow suggest it could become a formidable competitor in the UK chocolate market, should it so desire. That would be unsettling for Cadbury Schweppes.</p>

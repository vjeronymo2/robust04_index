			<p>BFN     [Text] Britain's SUNDAY TIMES newspaper has accused the  National Party [NP] and the African National Congress [ANC] of  perpetrating an enormous fraud in claiming that the elections  will be free and fair, and that there will be peace once a new  government is in place.    The newspaper dismissed claims by State President F. W. de  Klerk and ANC President Nelson Mandela that the constitution  they had drafted was a federal one, saying scores of foreign  experts had pointed out that it was not. The newspaper made an  urgent call for the election to be postponed.    The SUNDAY TIMES also accused the ANC of being responsible  for the massacre of Zulu demonstrators during their march in  Johannesburg last week. The paper said its reporters had proved  that most of the shooting had come from identifiable ANC  supporters.    The newspaper also said it had been arrogant of ANC  President  Nelson Mandela to deny detectives access to Shell House to  gather evidence.</p>

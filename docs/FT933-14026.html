			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / Schools to have performance pay MR JOHN PATTEN, the education secretary, will be allowed to designate schools in England and Wales as performance-related pay pilot schools, under the School Teachers' Pay and Conditions Document published yesterday. The paper confirmed government plans originally announced in April. The National Union of Teachers, the UK's largest teaching union, has already asked its members to boycott all appraisal interviews which form part of pilot schemes. The document also introduces a pay 'spine' for teachers in which points are awarded for experience, extra responsibilities and 'excellence in classroom teaching'. However, the government's intention to keep within the 1.5 per cent public-sector pay norm is also confirmed. The Association of Teachers and Lecturers said: 'The government in practice is not prepared to reward excellence. It says it wants to, but fails to deliver the financing.' Both the association and the NAS/UWT teachers' union complained that the late publication of the document, just as the summer term ends, placed an unfair burden on schools' administration. Mr Peter Smith, ATL general-secretary, said: 'The lateness of this report presents real problems for schools. Severe difficulties could result. Assimilation of teachers on to the new pay spine presents a particular challenge for management in these rushed circumstances.'</p>

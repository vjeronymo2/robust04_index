A governmental delegation of managers of  ministries that visited Magnitogorsk has returned to Moscow. The  objective of their trip was to prepare a presidential draft  edict concerning the completion of the modernization of the  Magnitogorsk metallurgical combine. The sum of necessary  investments for Magnitka's transformation into a modern  world-standard plant is estimated to be 1.03 trillion  rubles.[R]    The Magnitogorsk metallurgical combine is one of the largest  plants in Russia. Its maximum annual volume of steel smelting  has totaled 16 million tonnes--this record was achieved in 1989.  A large-scale program to modernize the combine was started in  1985. This program was supposed to be financed by the state, and  it was only partially implemented because of a shortage of  budgetary resources. Only the first object of modernization--the  oxygen-converter shop--was built--it was put into operation in  1991.    The next object in the comprehensive program of  modernization  of Magnitka was the hot-rolling "mill 2000," whose start-up is  planned for the first to second quarter of this year. The mill  has its own interesting history: At first, it was sold to  Poland, and, subsequently, the Poles changed their mind, and  "mill 2000" returned to Russia. All of these operations were  conducted under the aegis of interstate agreements. Magnitka had  to assemble it, which is also a rather expensive measure.    The third measure of the modernization program is the  start-up of the largest cold-rolling mill of "mill 2000"--one of  the main measures of the federal program for the development of  metallurgy. Up until now, similar mills existed only in three  Russian metallurgical plants--in Cherepovets, Volgograd, and  Lipetsk. Of course, they represent much older modifications. The  Magnitogorsk metallurgical combine has concluded a contract with  the German firm Schleman-Siman for a total sum of $590 million.  The general contractor for this project will be the Magnitostroy  trust. The Rosmontazhspetsstroy organization will participate in  the assembly work, and the Uralmash organization--one of the  contenders for implementing the entire project--will take part  in the production of equipment.    The introduction of all three objects will transform  Magnitka  into a modern metallurgical plant that conforms to Western  standards. It is expected that this will take four years and  that the volume of necessary financing will be R1.03 trillion.  Naturally, without state support that is manifested in both  favorable investment credits and in exemption from customs  duties for this period, the combine will not be able to  implement its plans. Although, as was declared by Mr. Sarychev,  the technical director of the combine, in order to attract  resources for the modernization with the help of issues, it is  possible that a scheme will be employed for a separate  conversion of the new plant to a joint-stock company,  conditionally called Steel-2.</p>

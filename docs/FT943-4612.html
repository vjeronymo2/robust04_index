			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / Democratic Unionists to consider options The Rev Ian Paisley stood on home territory yesterday, still fuming after his Downing Street confrontation with Mr John Major. Outside the Democratic Unionist party's headquarters in East Belfast Mr Paisley was cheered by a dozen flag-waving supporters. He said he had no immediate plans to call for a campaign of unionist civil protest. 'I am not calling on my supporters to take to the streets,' he said. 'We shall be putting forward practical plans for a Unionist forum.' The unionist newspaper The Newsletter said it had been inundated with calls from readers registering disgust at the way Mr Paisley had been treated in Downing Street. But many unionists were critical of Mr Paisley's position. A number of senior members of the Ulster Unionist party, including Mr Jim Wilson, its general secretary, said the DUP leader was undermining the unionist cause. Mr John Hume, leader of the Social Democratic and Labour party, and Mr Gerry Adams are given more credit for achieving the IRA ceasefire than the British and Irish premiers according to a Gallup poll in today's Daily Telegraph. Mr Hume scores 27 per cent, Mr Adams 22 per cent, Mr Albert Reynolds 18 per cent and Mr Major 12 per cent.</p>

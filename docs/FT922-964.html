			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / Technology (Software at Work): Microchips go well with wine  -Continuing a series on getting the most out of software by looking at how Lay &amp; Wheeler negotiated the transfer to a new computerised system Selling wine seems straightforward. You set up your shop, you place some attractive bottles in the window and wait for the eager buyers to hand over the cash. Wine, however, can be sold in a variety of ways. In addition to the obvious retail premises off the high street, traditional wine merchants sell wholesale to restaurants and hotels. They sell wine 'in bond' or 'en primeur' to private customers. They might operate a wine supermarket or a cash-and-carry store. Lay &amp; Wheeler, an old, established wine merchant based in Colchester, Essex, uses all of these methods to sell wines and other beverages. Choosing a new computer system in 1988, Lay &amp; Wheeler wanted one to serve all its outlets and provide integrated information systems for its management. 'We were operating a 19th century computer system for a 21st century operation,' says Ross Cowie, Lay &amp; Wheeler's financial director. 'Although we sell our products in several different ways, they are inter-related. The fine wines side supports both the wholesale operation and the mail order service. The retail outlets sell a range of drinks products by the bottle and by the case. And, if we are holding a wine tasting, it might be for both retail and wholesale customers.' In late 1987, Lay &amp; Wheeler's management looked at its operations with the aim of supporting them with a new computer system. Although based in Colchester, Lay &amp; Wheeler distributes wines, spirits and beers throughout south east England and runs a national mail order operation. The company has two retail premises in Colchester - a small shop in the centre of the town, which was established in 1862, and a wine 'supermarket' on the outskirts. It also operates a wholesale 'cash-and-carry' warehouse next door to the wine supermarket. The new computer system had to cope with these different outlets and, as staff are moved between operations, had to present a common 'interface'. Lay &amp; Wheeler needed to replace an ageing system running on a Burroughs B90 computer with a system to control order processing, distribution and invoicing, handle stock movements, and produce good management information. The Burroughs system processed the mail-order and the wholesale sales invoicing and distribution operation. It could not handle stock movements - nor did it offer any useful management information. Rather than buy a computer and try to fit the software to the job, Cowie wanted to find the right software from the outset. Selecting a new system can be fraught enough - even for experienced companies. Lay &amp; Wheeler took a cautious approach. Cowie and his colleagues worked out a specification which covered the business aspects of the new system. Cowie called in consultants Coopers &amp; Lybrand to ensure he looked at the right kind of company to build and install the system. Cowie's attitude to the consultant was pragmatic, however. Consultants are expensive and, once Coopers and Lybrand's staff had done their job, Cowie saw no further need for their services. With Coopers and Lybrand's help, Cowie drew up a shortlist. 'We shortlisted four suppliers and looked at their proposals carefully. We chose Kerridge Computers because it seemed to have the right attitude and fitted in with our way of working.' Cowie signed the contract with Kerridge in May 1988 with the aim of moving across to the new system by October at the start of the company's financial year. The software used to create Lay &amp; Wheeler's system was drawn from a mixture of standard components and custom-written programs. Kerridge supplied a suite of standard applications modules for accounting functions such as sales ledger, management accounts and cashbook. The sales order processing system - the all-important front-end of Lay &amp; Wheeler's operations - had to be built from scratch. A main reason was the complex pricing and discount structure which Lay &amp; Wheeler uses. 'We needed the ability to go to as many as 72 different prices for the same wine - 36 by bottle and 36 by case,' says Cowie. The main installation problems came from the custom-built parts of the system and, although it was close to being ready for the October start date, Cowie was not satisfied. Problems with the pricing of cases and calculation of deposits delayed the transfer: 'About 10 days before the target date, I decided we would have to wait another month. It was a bit of a risk going live in November - it is our busiest time. But we wanted to get it right.' Cowie says the delay only caused minor problems as far as the annual accounts were concerned. Once the central accounts were installed and Cowie was happy with them, Lay &amp; Wheeler phased in the other parts of the system through 1989. These included the point-of sale systems for the shop, the wine supermarket and the cash-and-carry warehouse. In October 1989, Lay &amp; Wheeler embarked on its 'first serious effort in stock control'. Lay &amp; Wheeler carries about 3,500 current product lines and may have as many as 5,000 recorded in the system. Each product has an eight-character code which works like an engineering part number. The code identifies the type of product, the vintage, and the size. 'Our first effort failed, not because of the software but because of our own systems. The main problem was coping with internal movements of stock.' The fine-tuning has continued during the last two and half years and Cowie is now satisfied that the stock system works well: 'We now get good management information - reports for the buying department and lower stocks held. We have reduced stockholding by about Pounds 500,000 and, at our last stock take we found only two mistakes,' he says. Cowie admits that the introduction of the new system has been hard work. He also admits that he 'never really thought about the user', especially with the product coding system and the problems of entering it at the point of sale. Kerridge has got round some these problems by incorporating a search program which can find products by name. Lay &amp; Wheeler's story is a classic of software development. The definition of the business problem, the selection of the supplier and the installation and fine-tuning of the application software all have a familiar ring to them. There is one difference, however. Lay &amp; Wheeler's system runs on the Unix operating system and the company is now on its second hardware platform. The applications software was moved to the new hardware last August with few problems, proving that the principle of open systems - that you can move software easily - really works. BUZZWORDS EN PRIMEUR is a form of wine 'futures'. Wine is bought while still in the barrel for subsequent delivery - usually after two years. IN BOND wine is shipped from the vineyard and held in a bonded warehouse, allowing the duty and tax payments to be deferred until final delivery.</p>

			<p>940409 FT  09 APR 94 / Brussels' lobbyists go back to school to learn art of charm Dogged by a public relations image that they admit is lamentable, Brussels' lobbyists will soon have the chance to learn new skills at a charm school of their own. The first professional course aimed at providing practical training for lobbying European institutions is to be opened later this month in Brussels by the European Institute of Public Affairs and Lobbying, which is devoted to teaching the tricks of the campaigning trade. The aims of the 13-week course, the organisers say, is to instil some badly needed US-style 'professionalism' into Europe's rapidly growing army of pressure groups - a sector that is now believed to employ about 10,000 people in Brussels alone, after more than doubling in the past four years. 'A lot of people believe that to be a good lobbyist all you need is a good address book - but it's a lot more than that. It is a professional skill and job,' says Mr Daniel Gueguen, a course leader and seasoned campaigner for Europe's sugar industry. But with the lobbyists' rise provoking alarm in some commission quarters, the creation of a special course on campaigning is likely to beg new questions about the lack of regulation of Europe's pressure groups. Later this month a committee of the European Parliament is due to consider proposals that Europe's lobbyists should be forced to register and operate under a formal code of conduct. The author of the proposal, Mr Alman Metten, a Dutch MEP, insists regulation is needed to 'prevent the type of abuses' he claims have become more widespread as the sector has grown. But the proposal has been criticised by the lobbyists themselves, who argue that regulation would merely create a new level of bureaucracy in a city already over-burdened by red tape. Either way, all sides agree that the army of lobbyists could soon be reaching US proportions. However, the lobbyists admit that US-style tactics are unlikely to work in Europe, particularly when faced with the more subtle political style favoured by France and the southern countries of Europe. Mr Gilbert Portal, of the petroleum industry lobby, says: 'The European style is less aggressive than the US. You cannot attack a French MEP in the same way as you can in Washington.'</p>

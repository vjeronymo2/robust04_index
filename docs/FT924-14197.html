			<p>921012 FT  12 OCT 92 / People: Prosser: challenge at the core of trade unionism Margaret Prosser has been appointed national organiser of Britain's biggest union, the TGWU. The post is the most senior to be held by a woman in that union and involves working with the general secretary and deputy general secretary on recruitment and organisation. Prosser's new job means challenging the seemingly inevitable decline of trade union membership, but her experience as the TGWU's national women's secretary in the heartland of entrenched male attitudes should stand her in good stead. Prosser, now 55, won a place at a private convent but at 15 left without qualifications to work in various offices. She had an early indication of the potential value of women's work when she found her wages as an accounting machine operator outstripped those of her labourer father. Her working life was set back when in 1966 her husband Joe became paralysed. She nursed him for eight years while caring for three children. Enforced experience of life on the welfare system led her to activism in the Child Poverty Action Group and from there to part-time working for an advice centre from which she completed a postgraduate diploma course in advice and information studies at North East London Polytechnic. She gravitated to heading the Southwark law project, which she helped found and in 1983 began working for the TGWU as a local official. Colleagues say she is down-to-earth, effective and unimpressed by her own status. She cites just one 'shouting match' in the eight years she has worked at the TGWU's head office in London. She is a stalwart member of the left-leaning walking group, the Red Ramblers: 'Some call us pink, but I won't have it,' she says. She is also an opera enthusiast, as is her taxi-driving son-in-law. ***** Les Dunn, formerly md of Volex Accessories and Marbourn, has been appointed md of Crabtree Electrical Industries; David Norman, formerly sales and marketing director of Volex Accessories and Marbourn, has been appointed md of both; all three are HANSON subsidiaries. ***** Roger Lanary, formerly director and general manager of Hamworthy Heating, has been appointed divisional md of combustion division of Hamworthy Engineering, a division of POWELL DUFFRYN. ***** James Shaw, formerly group personnel executive with Associated British Foods, has been appointed group personnel director of AIR UK GROUP. ***** Keith Egerton, chairman of Taylor Woodrow Property Company, has been appointed to the board of TAYLOR WOODROW. ***** Rudolph Kalveks has been appointed director of corporate development and Peter Moxom director of human resources at BOWATER. ***** John Amos has been appointed director and general manager of LMG Thermoplastics, part of LAWSON MARDON GROUP. ***** Peter Royer-Collard has been appointed to the board of NEOTRONICS TECHNOLOGY. ***** Tim Ward, formerly European director, personal sector with Barclays Bank where he was responsible for Barclays' personal banking strategy on the continent, has joined NATIONAL BREAKDOWN RECOVERY CLUB as md; he succeeds Ernest Smith, who became md of National Breakdown's parent, Green Flag, and chairman of National Breakdown in July.</p>

			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / Kent and Essex compete for EC aid PARTS of London and southern England have been selected for the first time by the government as areas which ought to be eligible for European grant aid. Islington, Tower Hamlets, Newham and Hackney and parts of other London boroughs, as well as areas of Kent, Essex and Sussex, and parts of cities including Portsmouth and Plymouth are included on the list of places for which the government is seeking designation on the European Structural Funds map. The government also wants the European Commission to make aid available to rural areas including parts of Norfolk and Cambridgeshire, the Peak District and the Yorkshire Moors and Dales. The European Commission is reviewing which areas should be designated Objective 2, which covers industrial and urban areas, and Objective 5b, which applies to rural areas. The new map takes effect from January. The Department of Trade and Industry yesterday published the list, submitted last week to the EC, of places it wants on the new map. Under the existing map Objective 2 covered 35.6 per cent of the UK population, and Objective 5b, 2.7 per cent. The submission, if approved, would raise these to 41.2 per cent and 4.9 per cent respectively. However, EC regional policy commissioner Mr Bruce Millan has said the new Objective 2 map should cover not more than 16 per cent of the EC's population in total. Proposals already received from other countries would, if approved, boost the map's coverage to 22 per cent. This has raised concerns that inclusion of parts of southern England could be to the detriment of the traditional industrial areas. Yesterday areas put forward for inclusion for the first time expressed their delight. Tower Hamlets said: 'We're very pleased with this. We were bitterly disappointed earlier this year when we didn't get assisted-area status from the government.' The EC has allocated its members a total of Pounds 10.7bn for Objective 2 grants between next year and 1999, and Pounds 4.17bn for Objective 5b. These cover up to 50 per cent of the cost of regeneration projects. Mr Tim Sainsbury, industry minister, said the Objective 2 list included places suffering high unemployment and industrial dereliction. The significant increase in Objective 5b coverage was possible, he said, because of the Highlands and Islands 'promotion' to Objective 1 - the category for regions lagging behind in development, and because of the increased Structural Funds allocation agreed by the EC last year.</p>

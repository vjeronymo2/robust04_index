			<p>931231 FT  31 DEC 93 / Leading Article: Why Edouard Balladur A scientific choice it is not. For publications that by tradition nominate a person of the year, the choice has always been an artificial and subjective business. There are times when it is unchallengeable: the two occasions in the 1980s, for example, when we settled on Mikhail Gorbachev; or 1990 - German unification year - when it was Chancellor Helmut Kohl. There are years of such unrelieved mediocrity that the decision goes to a controversial success story: witness 1992 and Deng Xiaoping. There are years where the hallmark is success and failure combined, sometimes in the same individual. Nineteen ninety-three has been one such. What is a person of the year anyway? To our mind, not a saint or a hero; not even a person whose actions are to be unequivocally approved. Our choices have tended to be individuals who have not only loomed large in the news, but who have succeeded in making a tangible, interesting and broadly positive impact on their country, their business or the wider world. They have been people who, we hope, say something about the big issues of the year. In 1993, a number of candidates might have fitted that rather woolly bill. The peacemakers were the most obvious - Mandela and De Klerk in South Africa and Rabin and Arafat in the Middle East, although significant questions still surround the peace process in both regions. News maker of the year was Boris Yeltsin, but far from freeing himself of political troubles during 1993, the Russian president faces an ever-deepening sea of them. Awful start Of western leaders, President Bill Clinton would have been a worthy choice. In the second half of the year, he has notched up impressive legislative successes from the budget to trade, and launched ambitious social reforms - but his foreign policy performance has been patchy and he had an awful start. Then there is Fed chairman Alan Greenspan. By keeping interest rates low, he has presided over an increasingly robust economic recovery without appreciable inflation - as well as helping to nurse the US banking sector back to health. But Mr Greenspan has yet to face his real tests: the agonising decision over whether, and when, to raise rates, and a battle with Congress over Fed independence. In business there was Rupert Murdoch. After bouncing back from his financial troubles, he has spent the year doing what many businessmen have not: expanding all over the world, and exploring new frontiers in the converging world of multi-media. But it is not yet clear that either the multi-media future, or his part in it, is going to be quite what he would have us all believe. Trade talks The outstanding success of 1993 was conclusion of the Gatt world trade talks, and it had many parents, including trade negotiators Mickey Kantor and Sir Leon Brittan, and Gatt chief Peter Sutherland. Any or all of these could have been our persons, but ultimately the negotiators' efforts stood or fell on their backing from political masters. Which brings us to our choice. The case for choosing Edouard Balladur is that he has pulled off a remarkable act of damage limitation in 1993. When he came to office, France was pursuing an unsustainable mix of fiscal and monetary policies, in a deepening recession, and in danger of succumbing to an ugly mood of isolationism. Since then, the economic policy mix has ignited a currency crisis, and the recession has shown only faint signs of easing. But Mr Balladur has sailed through it all, refusing to promise short-term fixes and keeping his eye firmly clamped on the main prize of a Gatt agreement that could be presented as acceptable to France. What is more, he has managed to boost his personal popularity in the process, which is more than can be said for most western leaders. Of course, he still has a vast amount to prove. If he fails to produce an economic recovery and a fall in unemployment in 1994, then this choice will seem odd. But if he shows signs of succeeding by the relatively modest goals he has set himself, then this cautious moderniser will be well-placed to become a reforming president of France.</p>

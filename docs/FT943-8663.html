			<p>940816 FT  16 AUG 94 / Hanson set to gain Dollars 200m from toy maker's flotation Hanson, the Anglo-US conglomerate which announces third-quarter results today, plans a stock market flotation for Ertl, the US-based toy maker, as part of its debt reduction programme. Mr David Clarke, chief executive of Hanson Industries, Hanson's US arm, said yesterday that Ertl had filed a registration statement with the US Securities and Exchange Commission for an initial public offering of 8.5m shares at an estimated Dollars 16 a share. Ertl, which is based in Dyersville, Iowa, will use the proceeds together with bank borrowings to pay Hanson about Dollars 200m (Pounds 130m). Hanson will retain a stake of up to 37 per cent in the company after the flotation. The proposed offer price values Ertl, whose products include die-cast models of Thomas the Tank Engine, television advertised promotional toys and plastic model kits, at about Dollars 216m. Ertl posted pre-tax profits of Dollars 14.1m in the year to September 30 on sales of Dollars 186m, and had net profits of Dollars 9.6m. Hanson acquired Ertl from Kidde in 1987 after a proposed Dollars 89.5m sale to Tonka fell through. Since then the company has consolidated its position as one of the leading US toy makers. The proposed deal is structured in a similar way to the flotation of Beazer Homes USA, Hanson's US housebuilding business, which was completed earlier this year as part of the group's strategy of reducing debt through the disposal of non-core businesses. Hanson's gearing rose to 86 per cent after last year's acquisition of Quantum Chemical, the US polythene and propane group. Since then a succession of disposals has reduced net borrowings to around Pounds 2.55bn and gearing to about 54 per cent, excluding the proposed purchase of Scholes, the UK electrical equipment manufacturer, which has yet to be completed. So far this year Hanson has raised about Pounds 810m through disposals, including Pounds 490m in the UK, and further sales are expected. Analysts expect future disposals to be focused on smaller companies in the US.</p>

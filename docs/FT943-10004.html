			<p>940808 FT  08 AUG 94 / People: Cyanamid's quiet Costello - Names in the News If Albert Costello sounded terse last week about someone wanting to take over his company, it's not surprising, writes Richard Waters. The chairman and chief executive of American Cyanamid has won plaudits from Wall Street for giving the company a new sense of direction in the 18 months he has been at the helm. His move to spin off Cyanamid's chemicals operations and add to its profitable crops business had helped lift the share price by 50 per cent in recent months. Last week, though, American Home Products offered half as much again to buy the company. Costello looks a company man through and through. Trained as a chemist, he has worked at Cyanamid since 1957 and rose through the ranks to head the agricultural products side of the company before being named president in 1990. On the way, he ran Cyanamid's Spanish operations and worked in Mexico. Costello's curt initial response to last week's bid was a statement that his board was reviewing 'a number of strategic options.' In the US takeover market these days, where directors tread warily for fear of lawsuits from their shareholders, that amounts to putting up a sign that you do not want to be bought. Unfortunately for Costello, though, few doubt that, with such a premium being offered, his company will fall to Home Products, if not some other bidder.</p>

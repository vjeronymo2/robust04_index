Alfons  Burtscher, of the Seibersdorf Nuclear Research Center, who  examined the metal, said that this material is usually used for  containers for radioactive substances, yet after extended  radiation with neutrons in nuclear power plants one might even  extract small quantities of plutonium from it. In the form in  which the uranium was found, it did not pose any danger to the  neighborhood. Burtscher said that the radiation was 10 millirem  per hour. [passage omitted]</p>

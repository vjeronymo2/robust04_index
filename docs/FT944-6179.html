			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Government Statements): Amusement machines included - Gaming machine licence duty Gaming machine licence duty will increase by an average of around 19 per cent for licence applications made on or after 1 December 1994 with the chancellor's intention to restore the real value of GMLD to 1987 levels. As of 1 November 1995, the scope of GMLD will be extended to include amusement machines, such as video and quiz machines, and, as a consequence, the duty will be re-named Amusement Machine Licence Duty (AMLD). However, snooker or pool-tables, bar billiards, football games and children's rides will continue to be exempt. A lower rate will be introduced for the newly taxed machines and, to help operators meet the additional cost, payment by instalments will be allowed for all machines subject to AMLD. The chancellor's intention is to raise additional revenue and to prevent the tax base for GMLD being eroded by competition from machines outside the scope of the existing duty. The rates of tax vary according to machine type, cost per play and the period for which a licence is taken out. The rates of GMLD were last increased in the March 1993 Budget, but only by 20 per cent when an increase of 40 per cent was necessary to restore the value in real terms to 1987 levels. The increase prior to 1993 was in 1987. A small-prize machine (also known as amusement-with-prizes) is statutorily limited to a maximum payout per play of Pounds 3.00 cash or Pounds 6.00 tokens. All gaming machines are limited to a maximum cost perplay of 20p. Five-penny machines and Other machines are commonly referred to as jackpot machines, the only distinction being the amount staked. Five penny small prize machines pay no duty. The seasonal concession which is available to operators of machines currently subject to GMLD, eight months (March to October)for the price of six, will continue but will not extend to machines which become chargeable when AMLD is introduced. Five penny smallprize machines will continue to be exempt from duty as will five penny machines which are not prize machines. All the machines currently liable to GMLD are subject to Home Office and local authority social legislation which governs stakes, payout and siting. These rules do not affect the machines which will be brought into charge by AMLD. The home secretary has indicated recently that he intends to consult on further deregulatory measures for gaming machines. Thiswill help machine operators to compete more effectively in the leisure market. The increase in licence rates on 1 December 1994 is expected to yield Pounds 5m in 1994-95 and Pounds 25m in 1995-96. Introducing AMLD is expected to raise Pounds 10m in 1995-96 and Pounds 30m in a full year, but this will be offset in the first year of operation by the introduction of payment by instalments, which carries a one-off cost of up to Pounds 50m.

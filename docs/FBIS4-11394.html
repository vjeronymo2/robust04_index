			<p>BFN     [Text] Lima, 23 Apr (EFE) -- Attorney General Nelida Blanca  Colan stated on 23 April that there is no evidence that the  Peruvian Army "commited outrages" during the antisubversive  operation that has been under way in Peru's northern jungle  since 5 April.    The attorney general, the Congressional Human Rights  Committee, and representatives of the Council for Peace and the  National Coordinating Board for Human Rights arrived at the  theater of operations today.    The Army is trying to eliminate Shining Path columns in  Leoncio Prado Province, on the left bank of the Huallaga River  in the northern Peruvian department of Huanuco.    The visitors boarded helicopters and overflew Venenillo,  Moyuna, and Mohena, villages where the National Coordinating  Board for Human Rights and certain news media claimed that Army  helicopters had fired rockets at civilians, leaving an  unspecified number of casualties.    Carlos Blanco, chairman of the Congressional Human Rights  Committee, reported that the theater of military operations has  been reconnoitered, and testimonies of the reported outrages  will now be gathered.    Blanco belongs to the ruling party majority in Congress. He  said: "We will stay here as long as necessary to gather all the  necessary testimonies."</p>

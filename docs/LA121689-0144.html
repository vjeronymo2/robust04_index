			<p><P> December 16, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ROMANIAN PAN FLUTIST JOINS SYMPHONY TODAY;  </P> <P> PERFORMANCE: GHEORGE PARVU WILL PLAY THE ANCIENT INSTRUMENT IN TWO SELECTIONS  WITH THE GARDEN GROVE ORCHESTRA.  </P> <P> It was in the dead of winter, early in 1988, when Gheorge Parvu attempted to  cross the Romanian border into Yugoslavia. He chose January for his escape  because, he said, guards at the heavily patrolled border "pay not as much  attention when it is cold."  </P> <P> He carried no food or water, but did have the wooden pan flute he had made  himself. Tonight, less than two years after his escape, he will play the  instrument in two selections with the Garden Grove Symphony.  </P> <P> After making it over the border and walking for 35 miles, Parvu was arrested in  Yugoslavia for lack of official papers and spent 15 days in a Yugoslav jail and  15 more in a relocation camp. He lived in Belgrade for four months and 10 days  -- he can recite the exact length of each stage of his journey -- before  receiving permission to emigrate to the United States.  </P> <P> He came to live in Anaheim in May of last year after a friendly American  consulate, a native of San Diego, recommended Southern California as a new  home. Parvu goes to work each afternoon as a janitor for the Placentia Unified  School District, but he hopes to make a mark with the pan flute, an ancient  instrument that has survived in a number of cultures.  </P> <P> Named after the Greek god Pan, the instrument is a bundle of hollow wooden  tubes of varying lengths; it is played by blowing down into the tubes. It is an  obscure instrument in the United States, though it has been popularized  somewhat by another Romanian, Gheorghe Zamfir, whose recordings are hawked  relentlessly on late-night cable television.  </P> <P> Garden Grove Symphony manager Yaakov Dvir-Djerassi heard about Parvu from  another musician and arranged a meeting.  </P> <P> "As far as we're concerned, we always look for the unusual," Dvir-Djerassi  said. Parvu auditioned in November, 1988, and was worked into this year's  holiday program, which also features the Vocalworks quartet. Parvu will perform  with the orchestra during "O Holy Night" and an arrangement of a Romanian folk  tune, "A Floral Dance."  </P> <P> Parvu has played during services at several area churches, but tonight's  concert is his biggest performance since his arrival in the United States. He  first heard the pan flute on the radio, as a child in Romania. He immediately  told his father, a pianist, that he wanted to learn the instrument. He studied  with Zamfir, among others, performed on several recordings and was featured on  national television.  </P> <P> But musical success was not enough to keep him in Romania. His father was a  dissident who was jailed twice; Gheorge converted to Christianity in 1980 and  repeatedly was persecuted for his beliefs. So he escaped.  </P> <P> "In Romania, we have very good people. It's a very nice country," Parvu said.  But, he added, the totalitarian government is another matter. He enjoys his  new-found freedom -- "I'm very happy," he said. "This is my new country" -- but  he worries about his homeland, which has so far been untouched by the wave of  democratization sweeping Eastern Europe.  </P> <P> "I have pain for my country, because every country in Eastern Europe, they have  victory," Parvu said.  </P> <P> Change, he hopes, will come soon: "All the time I hope, because is not hope, is  not life."  </P> <P>  The Garden Grove Symphony presents "Christmas Vignettes," a program of  traditional and contemporary Christmas music featuring jazz ensemble  Vocalworks, Romanian pan-flutist Gheorge Parvu and violinist Mischa Lefkowitz,  at 8 p.m. at the Don Wash Auditorium, Stanford Avenue and Euclid Street, Garden  Grove. Tickets: $7 to $25. Information: (714) 534-1103.  </P> <P> </P></p>

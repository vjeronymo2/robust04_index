			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "`Peace Agreement' Should Not Be Concluded Only </F> Between the United States and North Korea"]    [Text] In a special briefing concerning North Korea's  replacement of its nuclear fuel rods, Robert Gallucci, U.S.  assistant secretary of state, suggested that discussions will be  held for a third round of U.S.-North Korea high-level talks once  inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] are  completed smoothly.    It is highly likely that when the third round of high-level  talks are held, North Korea will propose more concrete steps in  improving military, economic, and political relations with the  United States which it has consistently called for in the past.  On the other hand, the United States will demand inspections of  both declared and undeclared nuclear facilities in North Korea  until the international community is satisfied with their  transparency.    What we must pay special attention to among the anticipated  agenda items at the third round of U.S.-North Korea talks, is  the issue North Korea will raise pertaining to concluding a  peace agreement on the pretext of improving military relations  with the United States.    Last month, North Korea claimed that this issue should be  dealt with from the viewpoint of overall disarmament on the  Korean peninsula because its undeclared nuclear sites are  military facilities. Thus, North Korea stressed that a peace  agreement should be concluded with the United States.    The proposal for concluding a peace agreement with the  United  States raised by North Korea in an attempt to counter special  inspection of its undeclared nuclear facilities has been  repeatedly put forward since the 1970's. The purpose of this  proposal is to replace the armistice system on the Korean  peninsula by concluding a peace agreement with the United States  and not the ROK. This proposal is also based on the logic that  North Korea will push for establishing the peace system on the  Korean peninsula through disarmament between the North and the  South and through withdrawal of U.S. Forces from South Korea on  the basis of a North-South nonaggression declaration and the  peace agreement with the United States.    This allegation of North Korea is misleading [hoguda]. The  real parties concerned with consolidating peace on the Korean  peninsula are none other than the North and the South. Only  when hostile relations between the North and the South are  turned into relations of coexistence guaranteeing the  North-South nonaggression declaration for building legal trust  [pobchok silloe kuchuk], when political and military trust is  built, and disarmament between the North and the South realized,  can a practical peace system be established on the Korean  peninsula and can discussion of a peace agreement between the  North and the South be held. However, the North Korean  allegation ignores this clear, precise reality.    Therefore, in the wake of a third round of U.S.-North Korea  high- level talks, our government, should closely cooperate and  call upon the United States to clearly convey its position to  North Korea that the peace agreement on the Korean peninsula  should be discussed with the ROK, the party concerned, instead  of the United States. At the same time, the United States  should emphasize the fact that a peace agreement with the United  States designed to force the U.S. Forces to withdraw from South  Korea, will not result in gaining genuine peace on the Korean  peninsula. Peace will only be gained when North Korea sincerely  implements the building of genuine, political, legal, and  military trust by amending its existing policies toward the  South, and only when North Korea strives to establish peace on  the Korean peninsula through a peace agreement between North and  South Korea.    We would like to urge the government to firmly maintain the  position that the peace agreement issue is different from the  issue of exchanging special envoys and that the ROK people will  never tolerate a situation in which the issue of peace on the  Korean peninsula is discussed without participation of the ROK.  While maintaining this position, our government should assume  an even more positive attitude toward the ROK-U.S. mutual  cooperative system.</p>

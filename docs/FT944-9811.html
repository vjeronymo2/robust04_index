			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / Personal View: Fault line on road to monetary union It may seem perverse that the future of economic and monetary union in Europe now looks dependent mainly on attitudes to institutional change and to political union. Yet that is the picture emerging from the latest discussions initiated by Karl Lamers, the foreign policy spokesman for the Christian Democrats in Germany's Bundestag. His insistence in last Monday's Financial Times (Personal View) that there is a 'fundamental link between monetary and political unions' undoubtedly reflects a powerful strand of opinion. For example, Mr Hans van den Broek, the European Commissioner, declared in London recently that economic integration was a means, not an end: the end was a political union. Experts in the development of the Ecu believe that the critical next step in Emu is to establish institutional parameters necessary for the Bundesbank to lead a move forward through Maastricht's Emu stages. Yet just as these issues become conjoined in key players' minds, there are signs of basic divisions of opinion on all aspects of the institutional agenda. For once, French opinion, and British, seems markedly at variance with that in Chancellor Helmut Kohl's CDU. In Brussels recently, Alain Lamassoure, the French minister for Europe, warned that a Maastricht-style attempt to push a 'federalist' agenda for the 1996 intergovernmental conference, or indeed one that was seen to attack national sovereignty, would fail to pass either a referendum or through the Assemblee Nationale. His remarks were a pointed response to Mr Lamers' notorious paper which, in the course of its clumsy advance across the national sensibilities of virtually every Union member, had lectured France on her attachment to 'the sovereignty of the etat nation which has long since become an empty shell'. Moderate opinion in the CDU and the Christian Social Union, its more Euro-sceptical sister party, has subsequently expressed concern about the paper, especially its suggestion of a 'hard core' of fast-track Euro states. Ironically, however, this is perhaps the most logical part of the paper. As Mr Lamers, its co-author, said last week: 'Someone who, like John Major, accepts the method of variable geometry in principle can neither disapprove of nor prevent the establishment of a hard core.' The deeper problem lies elsewhere and has received less attention: the current German approach is strongly centralist. It explicitly envisages that the European Commission will 'take on features of a European government'. It downgrades the Council of Ministers to a second chamber of the European Parliament. It seems to ignore the role of national parliaments. In fact, it seeks to create a single European state. Karl Lamers in Paris last week was quoted as arguing for a federal concept of Europe that would eventually become 'a state and not just a confederation of states'. This is precisely the fear of those who see Emu as a means to political union. Now the shape of that political union is being blurted out by its most influential advocates, Helmut Kohl's CDU. It is no wonder that Dominique Baudis, French CDS leader in the European Parliament and a CDU ally, objected to the use of the term 'federalism' in any 1996 treaty, to the idea of the Commission achieving supranational governmental powers, and to the downgrading of the Council of Ministers. The Franco-German fault line is becoming clear, sharpened by France's presidential elections. French opinion increasingly seeks to base European reform on giving power to national governments, national parliaments and the Council of Ministers. It is difficult to see how an Emu based on abolition of national currencies and a political union strategy based on a Commission/European parliament duopoly could satisfy French electors. However closely economies may converge, without more agreement on the next steps to political co-operation it is difficult to see how Emu could progress. No wonder the distinguished European Parliament constitutional expert, Fernand Herman, is gloomy. Observing that the chances of achieving unanimity at the 1996 intergovernmental conference are practically non-existent, he added: 'The chances of realising a lasting monetary union without reinforcing the political union are just as slim'. It has become conventional to praise the CDU/CSU paper and Mr Lamers himself for having initiated a valuable debate. With its undiplomatic frankness it has laid the key questions of Europe's political and economic future on the table, in good time for 1996, while exposing profound differences between Germany and her chief European partners. It is these differences that will need to be overcome. The author is an MEP and president of the European Policy Forum.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Lithuanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A couple of news conferences were held today at the  Lithuanian Seimas. The first was on Russian-Lithuanian  relations. Guoda Salciute reports.    [Salciute] Vytautas Landsbergis, Seimas opposition leader,  presented a statement to journalists at a news conference today,  concerning Russia's responsibility to Lithuania. Vytautas  Landsbergis also gave a review of trends in Russian policy  toward the Baltic states.    According to Professor Landsbergis the case of the  independence of the Baltic states is now nearing a critical  point. We see the latest statements issued by the Russian  Ministry of Foreign Affairs in which, under the guise of the  Russian issue [of the Russian-speaking population], all the  attention is concentrated on the justification of an expansion  toward the West, Landsbergis said.    Latvia has already been broken down after the big states  abandoned the principle, which they themselves formulated, of  the unconditional withdrawal of the armed forces; meanwhile  Estonia, while coming closer to the zero option -- i.e. giving  up the demand for compensation in the negotiations with Russia  -- will become the test case, the leader of the opposition  maintained.    Vytautas Landsbergis stressed that there is no need to  appeal  once again to the United Nations concerning the recognition of  the Russian occupation. This is the main issue in the  statement. I quote: Russia has declared itself the successor  of the USSR and in some important cases the international  community agreed with this, the statement reads. In the treaty  of 29 July 1991, Russia recognized the acts of restoration of  Lithuania's independence and renounced the annexation carried  out by the USSR. The referendum of Lithuanian citizens of 14  June 1992 firmly declared a sovereign conviction that Russia,  having declared itself heir to the USSR, has also taken over the  responsibility for the damage to Lithuania inflicted by the  occupation, the damage which should be compensated for.    Therefore, bearing in mind all these circumstances, the  reports that the president of Lithuania intends to discuss  whether Lithuania and other Baltic states were occupied by the  USSR or not at the oncoming summit of the Baltic states look  rather surprising -- as does an appeal to the world requesting a  reiteration of the recognition of the occupation. Whatever the  diplomats of the Baltic states or the Russian lobbyists in  Vilnius might propose, the very fact that the existence of the  occupation is doubted would mean great harm to the interests of  our state and a violation of the main documents of our  independence.    The Lithuanian president should not be drawn into such  dangerous maneuvers, Vytautas Landsbergis, leader of the  parliamentary opposition, says in his statement on Russia's  responsibility to Lithuania.</p>

			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / Big 6 experience black year FIVE of the UK's 'Big 6' accounting firms suffered a fall in fee income last year, according to figures released yesterday. Only Andersen - comprising Arthur Andersen and Andersen Consulting - managed to increase its income, which jumped by 17.5 per cent to Pounds 388.6m in the year to March 31. That caused the firm to rise from sixth to fourth in terms of fee income, just Pounds 2m behind Ernst &amp; Young. Price Waterhouse fell from third to fifth and Touche Ross became the smallest of the Big 6. Coopers &amp; Lybrand remained the largest, but also reported the biggest decline, down 4.2 per cent to Pounds 553m in the year to May 1. In 1991-92 it was the only one of the Big 6 to report a decline. Total fee income generated by the firms rose by just Pounds 2.5m to nearly Pounds 2.6bn. The number of partners across the firms fell by 1.4 per cent to 2,797 and the number of other professional staff by 6.4 per cent to 29,601. Mr Ian Brindle, senior partner at Price Waterhouse, said: 'It has been a very hard, lousy grind. The recession has had an impact on our clients which reflects directly on us.' Audit, tax and consulting services performed least well across most of the firms, generally offset by rises from insolvency and corporate reconstruction work. Mr Roy Chapman, senior partner at Arthur Andersen, said: 'It pays to be modest, but I can't really disguise my pleasure. We are pleased but not surprised. We have followed a reasonably clear strategy, with the right type of people pursuing the right sort of client.' The figures in the table have been compiled by the firms with year-ends adjusted to make the data comparable.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                   Performance breakdown of the Big 6  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Firm                         1992-93     % change on    no. of                            fee income      1991-92     partners  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Coopers &amp; Lybrand             553           -4.2         701 KPMG Peat Marwick             490.7         -0.8         598 Ernst &amp; Young                 390.6         -2.1         399 Andersen                      388.6         17.5         247 Price Waterhouse              385.7         -3.7         482 Touche Ross                   345.5         -1.2         370  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Firm                        % change        other      % change                                             prof'l  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Coopers &amp; Lybrand             -2            6,498        -6.8 KPMG Peat Marwick             -0.3          6,463        -7.6 Ernst &amp; Young                 -2.9          4,672        -8.0 Andersen                       5.6          3,707         3.6 Price Waterhouse               0            4,328        -6.0 Touche Ross                   -6.6          3,933       -10.6  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Big six accounting firms  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

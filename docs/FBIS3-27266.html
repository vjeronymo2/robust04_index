Yesterday a provincial telephone meeting on industrial  production and communications development was held to sound the  alarm for these enterprises.    At yesterday's meeting, Governor Chen Bangzhu stressed:  People throughout the province should seize the present  favorable opportunity and concentrate their efforts on  industrial production and communications development. Vice  Governor Zhou Bohua and Xu Youfa, chairman of the Provincial  Economic Commission, made arrangements for the next step in  industrial production and communications development.    In January this year, staff members and workers on the  industrial and communications front overcame their funding  difficulties. The gross industrial output value at the township  level and above amounted to 6.8 billion yuan, an increase of  35.2 percent over the same period of last year, and their  production and marketing rate increased by 3.2 percent over  January of last year. Many cadres and staff members gave up  their holidays for work. But quite a few enterprises allowed  their staff members and workers to overstay their holidays, and  a small number of enterprises have still not resumed production.  As a result, more than 7 million kilowatt hours of electricity  currently remain unused at the end of every day.    The future of the market looks bright; the metallurgical,  building materials, and nonferrous metallic industries have  continued to see a good marketing trend; and the textile, coal,  chemical, and light industries are recovering from a depression,  while some of their products have fallen short of supply.    Spring is a crucial time of year. Governor Chen Bangzhu  asked the governments at all levels to strengthen their  leadership over industrial production, to reduce unnecessary  courtesy activities and travel, and to help enterprises with  production.    Vice Governor Zhou Bohua encouraged enterprises to boost  morale, to organize production, to ensure a 22.5 percent  increase for the first quarter of this year, and to lay a good  foundation for the fulfillment of the annual tasks in industrial  production and communications development. He also issued  detailed requirements for enterprises' stability and steady  production.</p>

			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / World Trade News: Airbus wins Dollars 1.1bn order - The Farnborough Air Show AIRBUS Industrie has won an order for up to 10 of its new A340 long range wide body airliners worth about Dollars 1.1bn from Philippine Airlines. The contract announced yesterday at the Farnborough air show includes six firm orders and options for another four. With large orders for new aircraft scarce because of a slump in the civil aviation market, the Philippine deal is significant for the European aircraft manufacturing consortium of British Aerospace, Aerospatiale of France, Deutsche Aerospace of Germany and Casa of Spain. The contract brings total firm orders for the A340-A330 family to 264 jets from 30 customers. With its four-engined A340 and the twin-engined A330, Airbus is challenging Boeing at the top end of the airliner market traditionally dominated by the US company. Boeing also announced a firm order at Farnborough yesterday for four of its 757 twin-engined narrow body airliners worth about Dollars 240m from Shorouk Airlines, a joint venture charter carrier formed by Egypt Air and Kuwait Airways. The firm orders include one passenger and three cargo versions of the 757. The airline has also taken options on another four 757s including two passenger and two cargo aircraft. Shorouk announced earlier this week a firm order for two Airbus A320 narrow body twin engined airliners and options for a further two aircraft.</p>

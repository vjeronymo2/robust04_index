			<p><P> July 5, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FLAWED MIRROR HAMPERS HUBBLE SPACE TELESCOPE  </P> <P> Your article "Space Telescope Dealt Setback by Mirror Flaw" (Part A, June 28)  once again proves to me how the federal government is willing to spend billions  and billions of dollars on projects that usually don't work and only serve the  interests of the wealthy and not the poor.  </P> <P> It's unfortunate that the Hubble Space Telescope is blind as a bat, but I think  the proposed solutions for correcting its flaws are stupid.  </P> <P> Instead of wasting another trip by the space shuttle to try and repair this  expensive device, I feel it should be brought back to Earth for repairs. Then  if it can't be fixed here on Earth -- sell it for junk!  </P> <P> I am getting sick and tired of seeing my tax dollars being spent on expensive  projects that serve no useful purpose. Billions were spent on the Stealth  bomber and it can be seen. Billions were spent on the Sgt. York gun and all it  did was shoot itself in the foot. Now, billions are going to be spent for a  super-collider that will no doubt prove nothing. Pray tell, what horrors does  Washington have planned for our next billion-dollar project? I hate to venture  a guess, but how about trying to reinvent the wheel? Maybe the Hubble could  photograph it?  </P> <P> CHRISTOPHER D. PASCAL  </P> <P> Covina  </P></p>

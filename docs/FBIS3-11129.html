			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on Venezuelan economic developments monitored through 15  March.    Orinoco Iron and Steel Works, Sidor, and Colombian Steel  Works Corporation, Acesco, signed an agreement allowing Sidor to  open an office in Bogota. According to Sidor, Colombia is one of  the corporation's main sheet metal customers, and "having an  office in Bogota will allow Sidor to compete with similar  suppliers from Japan and Brazil." Company officials reported  that "this agreement is part of the overall economic integration  process."

The Central Statistics and Data Processing Office,  OCEI, reports that exports totalled $414 million. Meanwhile,  imports fell 43.3 percent for the same period. Experts said  "Venezuela's 1993 economic situation was the worst in recent  years."

(Caracas REPORTE DE LA ECONOMIA in Spanish 11 Mar 94 p  15]    Fedecamaras, Venezuelan Federation of Associations and  Chambers of Commerce and Industry, has issued its monthly  inflation report.

(Caracas EL NACIONAL in Spanish 12 Mar 94 p E10)    Following congressional approval of the Emergency Banking  Law, the finance commission approved the Public Credit Bill,  which will fund the former. Acting Finance Minister Luis  Grisanti said the bill "will not have inflationary effects and  will not force the Central Bank of Venezuela to print money  without appropriate reserve funds." He stressed the need to  restore financial equilibrium, as "solving the financial  difficulties of several Venezuelan banks is closely related to  the process of restoring trust." He added that "this will in  fact bring down inflation, reduce the exchange rate, and cut  interest rates."

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Anatoliy Yurkin] </F>   [Text] Moscow March 18 TASS -- Russian military experts do  not rule out a possiblity that the Iranian C-130 plane which  crashed near Stepanakert in Nagorno-Karabakh late on Thursday  [17 March] had been shot down by a mobile antiaircraft missile.    The depressurised plane was flying at a low altitude and  might have been mistaken for an alien craft by the warring sides  in the enclave, the experts told ITAR-TASS on Friday.    They added that there are enough weapons in the combat zone,  including the "Stinger" missiles, capable of destroying  low-altitude targets.    Experts said their fears are also based on the fact that  contact with the plane was lost all of a sudden and parts of the  craft discovered on the ground show that the explosion had  occurred in the air.    Such character of damages "happens after a strike of an  anti-  aircraft missile," experts said.    They also said it is necessary to find out why the plane had  deviated from the pre-set route.    The experts categorically denied a possibility that the  plane  was going to land in stepanakert as the runway there is too  short for such a class of aircraft. The crew undoubtedly knew  about that, they added.</p>

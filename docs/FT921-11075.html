			<p>920203 FT  03 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Maxwell recycled seized funds to banks - Last details of official investigations to be completed within weeks NEARLY ALL of the Pounds 900m siphoned away by Mr Robert Maxwell from public companies, pension funds and banks was recycled to other banks in a frantic attempt to shore up his tottering private empire. This is the conclusion of an analysis by the Financial Times based on the initial findings of official investigations into the Maxwell empire. Accountants and lawyers have spent months penetrating secret overseas trusts and will complete last details of their search within weeks. Their answers to where the money came from and where it went lay the ground for the next stage of the investigation: how it got there, and who is responsible. As the accompanying chart shows, between January 1991 and his death on November 5 the late Mr Maxwell seized a total of around Pounds 900m. The biggest part, an estimated Pounds 390m, came from Maxwell Communication Corporation, one of his public companies. The mechanism for the transfer was simple: he took around Pounds 200m from MCC's bank account in the form of unsecured loans to his private companies, which also owed MCC a further Pounds 50m in deferred payments on property transactions. A further tranche was syphoned from MCC in the form of shares in Berlitz, the language instruction company. Although MCC had agreed to sell its 56 per cent stake in Berlitz, just after Mr Maxwell's death, it subsequently discovered that most of these shares had been pledged to banks as collateral, making the sale void and depriving MCC of a further Pounds 146m. There is evidence that some of this happened after Mr Maxwell's death. At least Pounds 300m was taken from the pension funds of Maxwell's companies. Worst hit was the fund of Mirror Group Newspapers, Mr Maxwell's second public company, whose pensioners are now facing poverty. MGN also lost Pounds 97m from its bank account. Of this Pounds 47m was transferred out to London &amp; Bishopsgate Group, a private Maxwell investment vehicle, which was supposed to invest it in gilts, a particularly secure form of investment. However the money disappeared - partly to the New York Daily News, Maxwell's loss-making American venture. The other Pounds 50m was a loan to MGN from Bankers Trust, the US bank - but MGN never received the money. Mr Maxwell also seized the Pounds 50m assets in First Tokyo Investment Trust, which he acquired in 1991, for use by his private companies. Evidence emerged last week to suggest that in the spring he also began to "borrow" money from banks overnight by arranging foreign exchange deals with them, and failing to close the position - or settle the account - at the end of the day as the contracts required. It is now thought that this procedure  -at which the banks began to protest vigorously - made him up to Pounds 50m in 1991. In round numbers, therefore, around Pounds 900m was obtained by Mr Maxwell in 1991 from a variety of unorthodox sources. The investigators now have a reasonably complete view of the uses of these funds. Around Pounds 150m was soaked up rapidly by the trading losses of his private businesses. His taste for investing in new or troubled newspapers around the world had become a huge burden. The European consumed around Pounds 20m, the New York Daily News an estimated Pounds 40m, and the Berliner Verlag, a joint venture in Germany, another Pounds 40m. AGB, the market research group, and other businesses such as the North Sea helicopter fleet, together used some Pounds 50m. It is now clear that Pounds 500m of the money went to satisfy the pressing demands of the bankers who had lent nearly Pounds 1bn to the Maxwell private companies. Around Pounds 200m went to repay debts that fell due. Another Pounds 100m went in interest on the debt. The Berlitz shares, and at least Pounds 50m of other stocks, were given as additional collateral to the banks. The banks were demanding more collateral because much of their loans in 1990 and early 1991 were backed by Mr Maxwell's holding of MCC shares, and the MCC share price was falling. That pressure on the MCC share price led to the operation that has most shocked bankers and accountants working on the investigation - the secret deals to support the MCC share price. At first the share support was public. Mr Maxwell spent Pounds 150m in 1990 and a further Pounds 50m in 1991 on openly buying MCC shares. This took his publicly declared stake in MCC to 68 per cent by early 1991. But in April and May 1991, shortly before MCC issued a profits warning and just ahead of the MGN flotation, he began to buy shares secretly through hidden trusts in Lichtenstein, Switzerland, Panama and the British Virgin Islands. Some of this money - which ultimately totalled Pounds 200m - was from MCC itself. It is illegal under UK company law for companies to buy shares without their shareholders' permission. So how much of the Pounds 900m is recoverable for creditors? The private companies have some assets that are now being sold to help meet the debts they owe to the banks, the public companies and the pension funds. But most of this Pounds 900m seems unlikely to be recovered. Accountants believe that in the last few days of their investigations of the secret trusts they are unlikely to find hidden pots of Maxwell gold.</p>

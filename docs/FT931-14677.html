			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / Finance and the Family: BES set to grow THE Business Expansion Scheme could be about to expand, even though few schemes are on the market. Investors should be pleased with this because the delay has been caused by stiff competition between sponsors trying to tie up deals with universities and housing associations. They are now being forced to go through 'beauty parades', and as a result sponsors' fees are coming down. Speculation over another fall in base rates has also held up plans. If rates do fall from seven per cent, many of the institutions underwriting the schemes will want to cut the returns on offer to investors after the five-year tax exemption period for BES investments has closed. It is not clear how many institutions are going to use the BES to convert housing which they have repossessed into assured tenancies. BES makes it easy for banks to lessen the damage of bad loans on their balance sheets, but as yet no building societies have converted repossessions using the BES. Several are discussing this, and if they do so then the supply of products should be substantially increased. Non-recourse loans, which allow investors to exit from the investments after six months, have made it much easier to sell the scheme to customers, and so many companies with reputations in other investment markets may now launch into the BES. The bottom line for investors is that there should be enough money to go around, and it would be unwise to rush for the first scheme which appears, or to be disheartened if attempts to buy into a BES so far this tax year have been unsuccessful. The one new BES scheme this week is City North 3. It has no 'guarantee', but will aim to make as high a return as possible, with no upper limit. The company will invest in rental accommodation.</p>

			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Starmin restates loss and rescinds dividend STARMIN Group, the quarry products company chaired by Lord Parkinson, the former cabinet minister, yesterday said its previously reported full year losses had been understated by millions of pounds. Instead of pre-tax losses of Pounds 8.06m, the company said losses totalled Pounds 11.9m in 1992. The proposed final dividend of 0.2p will not now be paid. The change followed a review of the company's accounting policies, announced in July when the two Abdullah brothers resigned as executives. They had run Starmin since 1989. The review, carried out by Ernst &amp; Young at the new board's instigation, found that turnover should have been reported as Pounds 18.7m rather than Pounds 20.1m and losses per share 3.6p instead of 2.5p. The board does not believe it needs to amend the company's 1991 accounts, which were also scrutinised. In a statement the company said it was 'conscious' of the need to 'to establish a longer-term strategy for enhancing shareholder value'. The company is understood to be trading at break-even now, but is making losses after interest payments. The discrepancies hinge on profits having been booked on disposals which have now been reversed. First, the company recorded a Pounds 1.4m profit following the sale of some assets and landfill facilities to Chepstow Environmental Services in December 1991. However, that deal fell through. After CES pulled out, Jeniva Landfill, a private company, bought the assets, plus an additional quarry with a Pounds 100,000 net book value, and a Pounds 160,000 cash injection from Starmin. It paid for them in its own shares, representing 35.5 per cent of its total equity. Starmin booked an extra profit of Pounds 250,000 on the sale of the additional quarry. Starmin said a balance of Pounds 1.26m which had been recorded as 'owing' from CES was now being written off, while the Pounds 750,000 investment in Jeniva had been written down to cost of Pounds 438,000. Second, Starmin bought Tamar and St Mary's, two plant hire companies, in March 1993, paying Pounds 300,000 in cash and Pounds 2.06m in the form of assets and land. It took a Pounds 1m profit on the 'disposal'. The statement said: 'Because of the inherent uncertainties in the valuations of the assets concerned it would be inappropriate to recognise any effects of this transaction.' The board also made an exceptional provision of Pounds 1.03m relating to non-core activities.</p>

			<p><P> January 19, 1989, Thursday, Late Final Edition  </P> <P> '88 CONSUMER PRICES UP 4.4%; DROUGHT CITED  </P> <P> Consumer prices rose 4.4% in 1988, the same as a year earlier, as hefty,  drought-induced increases for groceries offset stable energy prices, the  government said today.  </P> <P> However, many economists worry that the country may be in for a taste of the  bad old days this year. They say tight labor markets and rising factory  operating rates will inevitably lead to higher costs for consumers.  </P> <P> Last year's 4.4% gain in the Labor Department's consumer price index matched  the 1987 increase, which was the highest since 1981 but was four times the 1.1%  rate in 1986, a 25-year low.  </P> <P> A 0.3% rise in the index in December, which followed a 0.3% November increase,  helped inflation finish the year at a moderate pace.  </P> <P> The summer drought, which shriveled crops and seared pastures, pushed food  prices for the year up 5.2%, the steepest rise since 1980.  </P> <P> Energy for the year rose only a slight 0.5% after an 8.2% jump in 1987. Still,  energy prices were far below levels before the 1986 oil glut, which pushed  energy prices down 19.7%.  </P> <P> The cost of medical care, up 6.9%, also rose faster than the general inflation  rate last year.  </P> <P> Tobacco prices posted one of the steepest rises of any sub-category, up 9.4%  for the year.  </P> <P> Clothing prices rose 4.8% overall, with men's and boys' apparel up 6% and  women's and girls' clothing up 3.4%.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Giovanni Caprara: "Green Light for the Made in </F> Italy Launcher"]    [Text] The program for an Italian launcher for small  scientific, commercial, and military satellites weighing between  500 and 1,000 kilograms is valid when the international market  for launchers, in which the Italian carrier could play a  positive role, is taken into consideration too. This briefly is  the direction that has come from the commission that was  nominated by Research Minister Umberto Colombo at the beginning  of August to settle the confusion that had arisen around this  question after the ASI [Italian Space Agency] had launched a  program with this goal.    The commission, which is presided over by Sergio Ristuccia,  a  magistrate from the Corte dei Conti [State Audit Court] and  comprises Francesco Carassa, former ESA [European Space Agency]  board president, Gianfilippo Cuneo, an expert in industrial  strategy, and Alessandro Minuto Rizzo, plenipotentiary foreign  minister, has terminated its enquiry and delivered its findings  to Minister Colombo.    The ASI had planned a program with a double project. One  being the San Marco Scout, managed by Prof. Luigi Broglio and  funded with 90 billion lire, with the goal of developing the  American Scout launcher of Loral (the former LTV) that has been  used up to the present time at the San Marco platform in Kenya.  The other has been assigned to BPD-Spazio of the Gilardini-Fiat  group with an initial funding of 120 billion lire. This  provides for the construction of the Vega rocket (an advanced  generation European carrier) and is centered on the development  of the elements that have come from the experience gained from  the auxiliary rockets produced for the Ariane carrier. A  prototype of the new Zefiro engine (that is part of the Vega)  was flown in Sardinia in 1992 and a second model was subjected  to successful ground tests last May.    The conclusions of the commission express a negative  evaluation of the plan that was supported by Broglio, because it  would finish with Italian money paying for the improvement of an  American launcher that would remain such, whilst the advantages  for Italy would be few, if not inexistent.    However the commission judged the development of an  industrial project favorable because it would permit the growth  of a technology from which strategic economic and market  advantages could be gained. This would provide a know-how that  would also make our country competitive in the emerging sector  of space transportation of small satellites.    The commission had to evaluate whether or not the Italian  initiative was valid on both an internal and international  level, so as to supply the Ministry of Research, which must  choose how to direct the Italian space effort, with objective  information. Now that the commission has supplied the  preliminary information, the current situation makes it  necessary to make a rapid decision, because a delay would  provoke the annulment of the evaluations expressed. As a matter  of fact the market for small launchers is developing rapidly and  as well as various projects put forward by countries like Spain  and Brazil that are far from the goal, there are others in the  United States (such as those of the OSC [Orbital Sciences] and  Lockheed) that have just arrived on the launching ramp, or that  will arrive in 1994 and 1995. India is also testing its  launcher and Japan has had one for years and is now developing  one (the M-5) that is even more powerful. The French have also  decided to do something, even if up to now they have not made  any precise plans. We have lost two precious years. Another  almost unproductive year would be fatal, as we would arrive too  late on a market that had already been conquered by others.    As far as the cost (estimated at about 400 billion lire) is  concerned, it is evident that the best solution would be to  involve foreign partners that would assure a reduction of the  investment adapting it to the tightness of current budgets and  also providing an increased force on the market. However, such  adhesions need to be organized quickly so as to protect the  primary role of the Italian space industry that must be involved  in its entirety.    Within the strategies that have already been indicated by  Minister Colombo, the effort for the construction of a launcher  could consolidate the potential that has already been expressed  with success in the sector (by Ariane and IRIS [Italian Research  Interim Stage]). This would guarantee acquiring a transport  system for which there is already a certain amount of  competition since it would have commercial spin-offs in the  short term that cannot be ignored. It is precisely this aspect  that would serve to balance the nature of the initiatives that  have been supported up to now by the ASI, including  telecommunications and scientific satellites, and the manned  Columbus laboratory.</p>

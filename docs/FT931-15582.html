			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Ladbroke to open 70 shops in Argentina LADBROKE RACING, part of the hotel, DIY, property development and betting group, said yesterday that it plans to open at least 70 off-track betting shops in Argentina over the next five years. The move, which represents another indication of the improving commercial links between Argentina and Britain highlighted by the visit last week to Buenos Aires by Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, could provide the group with an important entry into Argentina's lucrative betting business. Ladbroke has reached an agreement with Hipodromo Argentino de Palermo which runs the Palermo racecourse in the heart of Buenos Aries close to the River Plate - one of the country's two premier race tracks. Racing is held at Palermo three times a week throughout the year. Under the agreement, the group has acquired exclusive rights throughout Argentina for the distribution and marketing of Palermo's pari-mutuel (tote-style) betting to both the existing small number of off-track betting shops and its own facilities. Racing is extremely popular in Argentina but the betting industry is relatively undeveloped. Currently there are just 34 off-track betting shops, but the biggest of these take about Dollars 1m (Pounds 600,000) in bets each week. Mr Peter George, Ladbroke's joint managing director, said: 'Our racing operations have been following the situation in Argentina closely for two years. Horse racing and betting occupy a prominent and well-established place in the country's leisure industry and we are delighted to have gained the opportunity to be the leading off-track betting operator in the country.'</p>

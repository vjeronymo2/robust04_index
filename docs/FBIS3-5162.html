Bosnia hoped for Indonesia's  full and ceaseless support as NAM chairman, he told the press  here on Friday. Siladjizic, who arrived from Washington, said he  also hoped that countries which had so far supported Bosnia in  the UN to maintain its supports.    At Sukarno-Hatta Airport, the Bosnian leader was welcomed by  Foreign Minister Ali Alatas, Chief Executive Assistant to the  NAM chairman NANA Sutresna, and NAM's roving ambassador for  Europe, Akhmad Taher. He said that the future developments in  Bosnia depended on the UN agreement and Bosnia was convinced  that NAM could voice its supports and play its active roles in  the UN. Bosnia will, meanwhile, make use of any conducive  momentum by approaching Russia, he added.    Previously, the Indonesian Embassy [as received] in New York  had been notified about the wish of the Bosnian prime minister  to visit Indonesia.    He said that in his two-day visit, he will discuss with  Indonesian side the latest developments about the Washington  accord and the future steps to be taken by Bosnia. Siladjzic,  who is former foreign minister of Bosnia, was in Washington DC  for peace talks between Bosnia and Croatia. In the meeting,  both sides agreed to form a framework for the establishment of a  federation in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    They also discussed the possibility of Bosnian Serbs forming  a confederation with the Republic of Croatia. The establishment  of federation and confederation is expected to stop the  aggression against Bosnia and give priority to a plan to  reorganize the internal structure of the war-torn Bosnia.    On the possibility of forming a confederation with Serbia,  Siladjzic said that it depends on the initiatives from some NAM  members and several "friends" in the West, especially from the  Government of Russia. "I will meet Russian Foreign Minister  Andrey Kozyrev in Moscow to discuss the peace process and a  possibility of inviting the Bosnian Serbs to the peace  agreement," said Siladjzic who is going to visit Moscow mid of  this month. [as received] He believes that Serbia is the one  that must give territorial concession because Serbia is the  aggressor of Bosnia-Herzegovina.    The Bosnian prime minister said that diplomatic ties between  Bosnia and Indonesia will be established soon at the right time  when some problems are solved.</p>

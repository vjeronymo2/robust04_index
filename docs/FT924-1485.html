			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / Survey of European Finance and Investment - Switzerland (9):  More look to far horizons / The insurers MR SILVIO CAFLISCH, senior vice-president at Winterthur, Switzerland's biggest insurance company, cannot contain his enthusiasm about the successful expansion of his company in the UK. Only three years after its establishment, Churchill, the direct motor insurance subsidiary formed by Winterthur, has amassed a 2 per cent share of the motor insurance market and is beginning to make profits. 'It's a dream. I can feel lyrical about it, even though I don't expect such beautiful margins to last for ever,' says Mr Caflisch. Churchill, like Direct Line, the pioneer of direct selling in the UK, advertises its products in the press and television and sells directly to the public over the telephone. Nor is Winterthur the only Swiss insurance company innovating successfully in overseas markets. Zurich Insurance, Winterthur's biggest rival, is looking at its overseas business with a fresh eye, focusing on highly specialised market segments such as Wisconsin meat packers, US auto dealerships and British local authorities rather than the traditional 'all insurances to all customers' approach. These shifts in international strategy have been dictated by declining margins on domestic business as the Swiss seek to compete in a more competitive and deregulated European market. Overseas expansion is not new. The domestic Swiss market is simply too small to contain the ambitions of its largest companies. The nine biggest companies control 81 per cent of the non-life market, with Zurich and Winterthur between them accounting for nearly 40 per cent of sales. After rapid growth during the 1980s, the domestic life and non-life markets are virtually saturated. The Swiss spent Dollars 1,292 per head on non-life insurance and Dollars 1,635 on life insurance in 1990 - the highest levels of spending in the world - according to Sigma, a statistical digest produced by Swiss Re, the country's biggest reinsurance company. However, until recently the domestic market was highly profitable, generating huge surpluses which Swiss companies could invest in overseas ventures. A liberal taxation regime has enabled Swiss companies to build up reserves more easily than competitors in the UK and the US, while cartel - like arrangements at home have traditionally guaranteed healthy profits on domestic business. During the 1970s and 1980s these advantages allowed Swiss Re to consolidate its position as one of the world's biggest direct insurance companies and paved the way for Zurich and Winterthur to build their own overseas empires. Both companies have won a reputation as providers of global all-risks insurance programmes to multi-national companies, increasingly overshadowing British companies, which once dominated this field. Both companies also moved ahead in Europe. Both they and Swiss Re's local direct insurance subsidiary are among the leading foreign companies in the competitive and rapidly growing Spanish market, and have significant activities in various corners of the US. Recently, though, the character of overseas expansion has changed, as Swiss companies come under greater competitive pressures in their home market. 'The Swiss market is becoming more competitive, although a good steady flow of profits is still going to be there - but not to the same extent,' says Mr Simon Rudolph, insurance analyst at Morgan Stanley. Although Swiss voters rejected membership of the European Economic Area in December - which would have brought the country directly into the European single market - local law has already been modified in order to extend some of the provisions of European insurance directives to Switzerland. At the beginning of 1989, a cartel by which property insurers had set minimum premium rates was lifted, triggering unprecedented competition in the industrial risks market and moves are also afoot to liberalise the motor insurance market. 'The cartel is melting away like the snow in the sun,' says Mr Caflisch. New approaches have emerged in response to these realities. Winterthur's preparedness to break with traditional distribution methods and Zurich's highly selective approach to overseas expansion, are designed to boost underlying profitability. 'We made so much money in Switzerland we could subsidise our companies abroad,' says Mr Caflisch. 'There is now much more urgency to repatriate profits. In the past we have acted as a small copy of the mother organisation, serving traditional markets with traditional products through traditional distribution systems.' Churchill can do better than many of its more conservative competitors because it underwrites more selectively, rejecting drivers who it considers to be bad risks, and avoids paying commission fees to brokers, the industry's traditional intermediary. Winterthur sees Churchill as a laboratory experiment which it is already using to redevelop other parts of its international business. Already a 'direct writer' has been established in Denmark, for example. Zurich believes that by building up expertise and understanding the businesses of its clients in depth, it can obtain better underwriting results and a more stable long-term relationship with its clients. By emphasising its ability to provide advice about how to manage risks - by installing fail-safe equipment in a chemical factory or by new management procedures for the drivers of hire cars - Zurich believes it can not only reduce claims but also retain greater numbers of customers when policies are renewed each year, thereby cutting its overall distribution costs. Recent moves to acquire blocks of business from the stricken Municipal Mutual, were motivated less by the desire to pick up market share than by the desire to build up long-term relationship with MMI's local authority customers, so that it can manage the insurance business profitably. Chief executive Mr Rolf Huppi says that even though local authority business might have been loss making in the past, by working closely with customers and by being the best in that category of business, Zurich can make it profitable.  ------------------------------------------------------------                 NON-LIFE PREMIUM INCOME: 1990  ------------------------------------------------------------                           SFr      Market             Rank      Company              (m)      share %          Status  ------------------------------------------------------------ 1    Winterthur         2,235       20.6            Quoted 2    Zurich             1,931       17.8            Quoted 3    Mobiliar           1,136       10.5            Mutual 4    Baloise            1,041        9.6            Quoted 5    Elvia                736        6.8   Quoted/Swiss Re 6    Berner Allgemeine    502        4.6           Private 7    National             443        4.1           Private 8    Waadt                440        4.1            Mutual 9    Helvetia             418        3.9            Quoted 10   Schweiz Vers.        240        2.2          Swiss Re  ------------------------------------------------------------ Source: UBS Phillips &amp; Drew  ------------------------------------------------------------</p>

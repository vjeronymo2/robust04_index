			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ryan Cresswell] </F>   [Text] A security firm run by Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of  the Nation, MK, armed wing of the African National Congress]  commanders and manned by MK soldiers is operating in a township  on the edge of Johannesburg. Five MK commanders have  capitalised on their training in Angola and the former Soviet  Union to go into business. The MK officers -- together with  legal, commercial and human resource specialists -- founded  Alexandra Business Holdings several months ago with the aim of  employing MK returnees. They went into partnership with the  established Security Operations Group and obtained the backing  of ANC [African National Congress] deputy secretary general  Jacob Zuma.    This week, the group launched its first security firm and  negotiations for the formation of another four companies are  under way. The guards, armed with revolvers and shotguns, will  soon start protecting trucks in Alexandra and industries on the  outskirts of the township. The firm has already signed to  protect trucks belonging to soft drink giant Amalgamated  Beverages Industries.    Alexandra Business Holdings chairman Sam Buthelezi said the  company planned to use an "empowerment strategy" to contribute  towards more stable and harmonious communities.    Director Mandla Maseko is still MK chief of staff in  Alexandra and was trained in Angola and the Ukraine before doing  time on Robben Island. "Guerrilla training is an advantage in  this type of work, but extra security training is necessary," he  said.</p>

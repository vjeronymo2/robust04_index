			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] [Announcer] The trial of former communist  President Ramiz Alia and nine high Communist Party and state  functionaries began today. Here is Marrash Mirashi.    [Mirashi] [passage omitted] The primary former heads of the  communist nomenklatura were again gathered together, but this  time not to give directives but to render account to Albanian  justice. [passage omitted]    After presenting the defendants and their counsels, they  were  asked whether they agreed with the judicial body or not.  Defense Counsel Kleanthi Koci and his client, defendant Ramiz  Alia, did not agree with the judicial body, claiming that it is  not of high stature and lacks experience. This was followed by  other defendants and their counsels. Koci asked that the trial  be suspended for defendant Alia.    Their respective defense attorneys asked that the trial of  defendants Zylyftar Ramizi and Veiz Haderi be set apart from the  rest of the group, because they had been soldiers and cannot be  judged by a civil court. They also asked for new witnesses.    Defendant Alia requested that television broadcast the trial  in full, saying: I have been head of state and the people should  know what I have to say. In response, the chairman of the  judicial body stressed that the media is free.    The prosecutor was asked to change the security measures for  defendant Simon Stefani. Later, the presentation of witnesses  was held. There was a great number of witnesses, among whom  were old state and party apparatus workers, dependents or  colleagues of the defendants, but also people harmed by the  activity of the defendants in this trial.    The judicial body withdrew to make decisions on the demands  put forward. Mr. Celiku, chairman of the judicial body, then  took the floor. He found the aforementioned demands not based  on law and rejected them.    Prosecutor Neshat Thana read out an approximately 60-page  indictment. Defendants Ramiz Alia, Adil Carcani, Manush Myftiu,  and Rita Marko are facing charges of conspiring to  misappropriate state property for a total amount of 2,883,502  leks and of the abuse of power, resulting in the illegal  violation of the fundamental rights of citizens and financial  damages amounting to 484,778 leks.    Defendants Simon Stefani and Hekuran Isai were charged with  conspiring to abuse their positions, resulting in the illegal  violation of the fundamental rights of citizens to the detriment  of the lives of several persons, murders committed at the  border, and violation of the equality of citizens through the  creation of privileges.    Aranit Cela and Rrapi Mino are charged with conspiring to  abuse their positions, resulting in the illegal violation of the  fundamental rights of citizens.    Zylyftar Ramizi is charged with conspiring to abuse his  position, resulting in the illegal violation of the fundamental  rights of citizens to the detriment of people's lives.    Veiz Haderi is charged with conspiring to abuse his  position,  resulting in humiliating acts against citizens detained or  killed at the border.    The indictment contained concrete examples of genocide,  violence, and abuse. After the indictment was read, the  chairman of the judicial body took the floor:    [Begin recording] [Celiku] Did you hear the indictment? Did  you understand it? What is your position on it? Do you accept  it or not? [end recording]    [Alia] The indictment? I do not accept it. [end recording]    Just like the defendant Ramiz Alia, none of the other  defendants or their counsels accepted the indictment.    At the end of today's trial hearing, the order in which the  defendants would be questioned was decided. The chairman of the  judicial body then closed the hearing. The next session will  begin at 0900 tomorrow morning with the interrogation of the  defendants.</p>

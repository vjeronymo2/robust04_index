			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / Mexico's GDP grows 0.5 per cent Mexico's gross domestic product grew by 0.5 per cent in the first quarter, the first indication of an economic recovery after the recession of last year, reports Damian Fraser. However the manufacturing sector contracted by 1.7 per cent, with some sectors such as textiles, paper and wood especially hard hit. The government said that growth had been dampened by most of Easter Week falling in the first quarter this year, unlike last year, which reduced the number of working days in the quarter. An adjustment to take account of the consequent variation in numbers of working days would have shown expansion in the manufacturing sector year.</p>

			<p><P> September 17, 1990, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> LADOUCEUR SAYS SOCKER OFFER TOO LITTLE TO GET HIM TO CAMP  </P> <P> Midfielder Jacques Ladouceur, one of only two Sockers to play in all 52  regular-season games last year, might play in none this season.  </P> <P> Ladouceur said he will not be at the start of training camp today (9 a.m. at  Folsom's Racquet Club) and that he is considering not playing this season  because he has not been offered an acceptable contract.  </P> <P> Last year, Ladouceur, a five-year veteran, earned $20,000, but he likely would  have made more had he not skipped the previous season because of a business  venture.  </P> <P> "And I had no problem with (last year's salary), because I hadn't played for a  year," Ladouceur said. "But I gave my heart and soul to the team last year, and  I feel what they offered me this year was not a fair offer."  </P> <P> Ladouceur said the club offered the same money as last year, but Coach Ron  Newman said it actually offered a raise, though he wouldn't specify how much.  </P> <P> "Jacques has been offered a contract -- in fact, he was offered a raise -- but  he declined it," Newman said. "Maybe he's waiting for something more, but there  is nothing else."  </P> <P> The Sockers spent $718,500 on salaries last year, not including traded or  developmental players, but because of a reduced salary cap, they can spend no  more than $630,000 this year.  </P> <P> In 52 games, Ladouceur scored 12 goals and assisted on 13. He also blocked 23  shots.  </P> <P> Socker Notes  </P> <P> Midfielder Branko Segota also is not expected to be on hand today. He is signed  and entering the final year of a guaranteed contract, but he never returns from  Yugoslavia for the start of training. . . . George Fernandez, the other Socker  who played in all 52 regular-season games last year, signed with Cleveland.  </P></p>

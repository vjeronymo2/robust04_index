			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: Travel industry After Tuesday's interim figures from Airtours, yesterday's 85 per cent increase in annual profits from Hogg Robinson suggests the travel industry is springing into life. There is a danger of exaggeration, however. Hogg Robinson's results, which in any case depend more heavily on business travel than the leisure market, follow a year beset by the Gulf war and loss of commissions on holidays booked with the now defunct ILG. Airtours' figures reveal little about the all-important summer season. Total summer holiday bookings through May were up an estimated 20 per cent for the market as a whole, a large part of the increase simply reflecting bounce back from Gulf war weakness in 1991. Hogg Robinson says its leisure bookings are up eight per cent by volume and one per cent by price since the end of March. Airtours' market share is growing, but the question is how margins look at the end of the day. That depends on the extent of discounting during the late booking period now getting under way. Industry estimates suggest there may be excess capacity in the market of some 200,000 to 400,000 holidays, depending on how normal take-up is defined. That is not excessive by industry standards, but it still leaves room for discounting by operators seeking to buy market share. Thomson's share of the summer package market is still some 14 points ahead of both Airtours and Owners Abroad. But at the end of May, it was also below 30 per cent, a level with which it cannot feel entirely comfortable.</p>

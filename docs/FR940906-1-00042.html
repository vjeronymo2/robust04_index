That  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice will present the Service's tentative negotiating positions on these agenda items and resolutions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Nomenclature Committee, in conjunction with the Wildlife trade Monitoring Unit, has been working to review and resolve numerous ambiguities in the Appendices that arose from the listing of taxa at the plenipotentiary and first meetings of the Conference of the Parties. Supporting documents were not a matter of record at these initial meetings. In addition, accepted names for those originally listed taxa have changed in some instances. The Nomenclature Committee has submitted a list of such clarifications to the CITES Secretariat for consideration by the Parties at COP9. A copy of this report is available from the Office of Scientific Authority. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The next regular meeting of the Parties is scheduled to be held in Fort Lauderdale, Florida from November  <!-- PJG 0034 unknown --> 7&hyph;18, 1994. The Service will develop final negotiating positions and announce these decisions prior to the meeting of the Conference of Parties. These negotiating positions will be based upon the best available biological and trade information, taking into account comments received in response to this notice. If further information is presented at the meeting in Fort Lauderdale, the U.S. delegation to COP9 will also take it into account in determining whether the Service's previous positions remain appropriate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Public Meeting <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Service announces a public meeting on September 14, 1994, from 9:30 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. in the Buffet Room adjacent to the cafeteria of the Department of the Interior, 18th and C Streets, NW., Washington, DC.

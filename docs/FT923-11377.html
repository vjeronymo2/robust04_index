			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / France unveils Maastricht campaign THE French government yesterday unveiled a FFr25m (Pounds 2.56m) advertising campaign to persuade the French people to vote in favour of the Maastrict treaty on European union in the forthcoming national referendum. The campaign, which kicks off on Monday under the slogan 'L'Europe est adulte. Donnons-lui sa majorite' ('Europe has grown up. Give it a majority') is by far the most ambitious promotional programme undertaken by any government so far in the Maastricht debate. It will include five television commercials, each featuring a series of commentators speaking in favour of European union, radio advertising and posters placed on 6,814 billboards across France. Full page advertisements will be placed in 75 French daily papers next Wednesay. The campaign has been co-ordinated by Mr Jacques Seguela, director of the Roux-Seguela-Cayzac et Goudard advertising agency in Paris and a close associate of President Francois Mitterrand. Mr Seguela has orchestrated marketing campaigns for both the Socialist party and the president in recent elections. A 'yes' vote in the Maastricht referendum, which takes place on September 20, is seen as critical to the credibility of the socialists in the approach to next year's National Assembly elections.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 4 KYODO -- The ruling coalition  parties on Friday [4 February] revoked Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa's tax program that threw Japan's political world into  chaos Thursday and threatened the near collapse of the  six-month-old governing alliance.    Ichiro Ozawa, the chief coalition strategist and co-leader  of  Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party), a key coalition party, made the  announcement at a news conference following morning talks among  leaders of the ruling coalition parties.    "Coalition parties have reached the conclusion that they  should scrap both plans to introduce the new tax and implement a  tax cut as they could not reconcile their differences over the  plans," Ozawa said.    Ozawa is widely regarded as the behind-the-scenes architect  of the tax package which Hosokawa unveiled at an early Thursday  news conference.    The main opposition Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] rapped  the  coalition government for revoking both plans to introduce the  new tax and to implement a tax cut.    LDP secretary general Yoshiro Mori said, "they used an  irresponsible strategy and the cabinet should take much of the  blame."    Hosokawa's package calls for a 6 trillion yen reduction in  income tax and for replacing the current 3 percent consumption  tax with a 7 percent "national welfare tax." The Finance  Ministry had planned to cover the tax cut with revenue earned  from the proposed new tax, the officials said.    The Social Democratic Party, the largest among the seven  ruling parties, renewed its threat to withdraw the party's six  cabinet ministers from the Hosokawa administration if the  coalition came up again with a plan to increase taxes.    Emerging from the talks with the coalition partners, SDP  Secretary General Wataru Kubo said, "although the coalition  representatives discussed various aspects of the matter, we  could not reach any agreement."    "We therefore concluded that the tax cut and increase plan  will be taken back to the drawing board so we can spend more  time for discussion of the matter," he said.    Following the announcement of the scrapping of the tax plan,  Hosokawa pleaded with coalition partners to resume discussion on  the issue of tax reform, officials said.    Hiroyuki Sonoda, a senior legislator of Sakigake  (Harbinger),  one of the seven ruling parties, quoted Hosokawa as saying, "I  want coalition parties to revive discussions" over the tax plan.    Officials said the coalition leaders had to make the  decision  in order to alleviate intracoalition discord over the new 7  percent "National Welfare Tax," as the SDP threatened to quit  the coalition in protest at the new tax proposal.    The Finance Ministry's original plan called for issuing  deficit-financing bonds to fund the tax cut and then redeeming  the bonds and interest with revenue from the new tax to be  imposed in three years' time.    However, a well-placed government source suggested that the  Hosokawa administration will have to quickly engineer concrete  tax cut measures to achieve the 15 trillion yen comprehensive  pump-priming package which Hosokawa will cite at a February 11  summit with U.S. President Bill Clinton in Washington.    The Clinton administration has been urging Japan to take  drastic economic stimulus measures to pull the slumbering  Japanese economy out of recession, revive consumer spending and  thereby pare back Japan's huge trade surplus with the United  States.    The Japanese Government was reportedly compiling the 15  trillion yen economic stimulus package featuring the 6 trillion  yen tax cut measure as well as increased public works spending  in the face of a veiled U.S. threat to invoke its super 301  retaliatory trade provision.    Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Hatoyama, reacting to  the news of the decision to revoke the new tax plan, suggested  to reporters the Hosokawa administration has not yet given up  the hope of compiling the comprehensive pump-primer package  before Hosokawa's departure for the United States on February 10.    Hatoyama said, "We still have Friday and Saturday" to hammer  out an intracoalition accord to compile a revenue-securing  measure that would enable the government to compile the package.    SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama told reporters, "we are  trying  to secure an agreement to set up an inter-party consultative  panel on tax measures, while the issue of how to raise revenue  to finance a tax cut should be taken back to the drawing board."    "If we continued to spurn the coalition's tax proposal, it  could lead the coalition to collapse. We have to make a policy  choice by considering where the SDP could offer certain  concessions without splitting the coalition," Murayama said. He  did not elaborate on the possible compromise deal.    Health and Welfare Minister Keigo Ouchi, leader of another  coalition partner, the Democratic Socialist Party, told  reporters he believes the coalition should reform its method of  producing and proposing a new policy measure.    "My Welfare Ministry is in charge of welfare affairs. It is  strange for the National Welfare Tax proposal to have surfaced  without any advance consultations with the ministry" Ouchi said.    The SDP has blasted the new tax plan as a ploy to force the  nation to accept a de facto doubling of the current 3 percent  consumption tax rate by merely renaming it as a "welfare tax."    The SDP has argued that the coalition should insert into the  new tax legislation wording that would ensure all the fresh  revenue from the new tax be used solely for welfare purposes.    But the Finance Ministry has resisted the SDP demand, saying  that such a provision would tie the hands of the government in  funneling the revenue to fund various policy measures.    The SDP, which has insisted on the abolition of the  consumption tax, boosted its parliamentary strength in a 1989  House of Councillors election shortly after then Prime Minister  Noboru Takeshita enraged voters with the consumption tax he  introduced.</p>

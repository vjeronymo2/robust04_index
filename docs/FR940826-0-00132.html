			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 78. We agree. The new 100,000 access line rural telephone company definition adopted above includes the access lines of affiliates. Under the affiliation rules established in the context of broadband PCS, and adopted below as our generic affiliation rules, the access lines of holding companies, parent companies or affiliates of rural telephone companies that are not independently owned will be attributed for purposes of determining eligibility. This definition will capture most of the independently owned rural telephone companies, while excluding carriers affiliated with the largest LECs. In addition, we are concerned that the requirement that a rural telephone company must be independently owned would unnecessarily exclude rural telephone companies that are part of a holding company structure. Therefore we will delete the ``independently owned and operated'' requirement from our standard rural telephone company definition. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 79. With respect to ATU's request that we amend our definition of rural telephone company to include municipal and government owned telephone companies that are owned by governmental authorities, we do not believe that such a change is warranted. ATU contends that Congress meant to mandate special consideration not only for telephone carriers serving rural areas but also for all municipally-owned telephone companies, even those with wholly or predominantly urban service areas. <FOOTCITE>122</FOOTCITE>  This argument is based on ATU's interpretation of the Senate bill which preceded the enacted Budget Act. ATU argues that the Senate bill containing the prototype of a mandate for special consideration for rural telephone companies directed the FCC to grant ``rural program licenses'' to ``qualified'' common carriers and explicitly said that the category of ``qualified'' carriers included all state-owned and municipally-owned telephone companies. ATU further states that the report of the conference committee that drafted the Budget Act declares that the Senate's ``findings'' are incorporated by reference. <FOOTCITE>123</FOOTCITE>  ATU also asserts that without the aid of special assistance it and most other state-owned and municipal telephone companies will not be able to purchase spectrum licenses at auction because it is politically infeasible for them to generate and retain enough surplus revenue to fund such investments, due to popular aversion to increases in taxes or telephone rates. <FOOTCITE>124</FOOTCITE>   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 122 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> ATU Petition at 2&hyph;3. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 123 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Id. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 124 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Id. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  at 4&hyph;5. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 80. As we indicated in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Fifth Report and Order, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  we are not persuaded by ATU's arguments. <FOOTCITE>125</FOOTCITE>  We can find no specific evidence that Congress intended the term ``rural telephone companies'' to include all state or municipally-owned telephone companies. In fact, the preceding bill contained an explicit mandate for preferential treatment of government-owned telephone companies that was deleted from the enacted bill. To the contrary, the fact that an antecedent bill contained an explicit mandate for preferential treatment of government-owned telephone companies that was deleted from the enacted bill could just as easily be interpreted as an indication that Congress rejected such a rule. We also disagree that state and municipal governments are without the means to participate successfully in auctions. As we noted in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Fifth Report and Order <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  such governments have substantial capabilities to raise funds through private financing, bond offerings and taxation. <FOOTCITE>126</FOOTCITE>   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 125 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See Fifth Report and Order  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> at &para;203. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 126 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See Fifth Report and Order  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> at &para;200. In any event, most state and municipally owned telephone systems (although not ATU) will be captured by our new 100,000 access line rural telephone company definition. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> C. Rural Telephone Company Consortia <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 81.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Petitions <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Telephone and Data Systems, Inc. (TDS) requests that the Commission relax the eligibility requirements for rural telephone company bidding consortia by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) eliminating the 50,000 access line limit for rural telephone company consortium applicants; (2) allowing companies with more than 50,000 access lines, directly or through affiliates, to participate in rural telephone company consortia by demonstrating that more than 50 percent of their access lines company-wide (including affiliates) and over 50 percent of those in the proposed service area serve only communities with 10,000 or fewer inhabitants and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) providing that all rural telephone companies in consortia with 50,000 access lines or less have the right to hold up to 60 percent of the equity in the consortium. SDN and NTCA also argue that the Commission should allow rural telephone companies to form consortia, since combining telephone companies would not alter their rural nature, so long as the rural telephone company retains at least 50.1 percent equity and control. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 82. USIN similarly requests that small businesses, including rural telephone companies, be allowed to qualify for special provisions if they pool their resources into consortia, provided such consortia are controlled by designated entities. According to USIN, if such consortia are not permitted, rural telephone companies and other small businesses may be foreclosed from participation in the auction process and in the provision of auctionable services. USIN also indicates that efficiencies and economies of scale are created by aggregation and thus special measures should be provided to these entities who may be able to provide service most efficiently. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

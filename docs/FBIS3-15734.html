Krasnitskiy and A. Yegorov have appealed in their own right to  the city prosecutor's office, the St. Petersburg and Oblast  Internal Affairs Main Administration Administration for  Combating Economic Crime, and the State Tax Inspectorate for St.  Petersburg to carry out a check on the legality of a number of  financial transactions sanctioned by B. Kurkova, leader of the  "Petersburg--5 Kanal" state television and radio company.    The deputies, so the report says, presented the law  enforcement agencies with documents which are in their view  evidence of bribe-taking by officials, in particular B. Kurkova.  The deputies also appealed to St. Petersburg Mayor A. Sobchak  in an open letter which says inter alia:    "We consider it your moral duty to see to it that an  objective investigation is carried out. We hope you will  understand that there are grounds -- based on public opinion --  for fearing that you will apply official pressure in the  investigation. We do not doubt your honesty and impartiality or  your direct interest in the observance of law in the city."</p>

			<p><P> December 4, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PROFESSOR SAYS PESSIMISTIC TREND MAY BOTTOM OUT  </P> <P> Although 44% of residents surveyed think that Orange County will become a worse  place to live, UC Irvine professor Mark Baldassare believes that a trend of  pessimism about the future may be bottoming out.  </P> <P> Changes respondents are willing to make in their lifestyles to protect the  environment -- such as conserving water, recycling and supporting  transportation alternatives as well as freeway construction -- bespeak a sense  that people can improve matters, said Baldassare, who released the results of  the 1990 Orange County Annual Survey on Monday.  </P> <P> "We're seeing the beginning of a new trend in which people are feeling that  they can do something about the environment," Baldassare said. "And they are  feeling that perhaps things can be done about traffic and uncontrolled growth."  </P> <P> To be sure, those who believe that things are going "badly" in Orange County --  25% -- now outnumber those who say things are going "well" -- 22% -- among the  1,017 adults surveyed in September. The negative rating has increased 12  percentage points since 1987, while positive attitudes dropped 15 points over  the same period.  </P> <P> Worries about traffic, the lack of affordable housing and a dramatic decline in  consumer confidence all play to that pessimism. At the same time, Baldassare  noted, the survey shows a willingness to support transit alternatives such as  light rail, as well as building new freeways and new lanes on existing  freeways.  </P> <P> Adding to that, survey respondents say they are more often conserving water,  recycling trash, buying environmentally safe products and limiting driving.  </P> <P> And although local consumer confidence has plummeted in the wake of the Persian  Gulf crisis and the nation's downward economic spiral, the median income of  respondents increased 9% over the previous year. More than half of those  surveyed expressed confidence that it would rise again in 1991.  </P> <P> "Orange County is doing pretty well economically," Baldassare said. "There are  obvious pockets which have serious difficulties, and there are people with  serious worries about the future. For young residents, for example, . . . there  are great concerns about high housing costs. For older residents, health care  appears to be a pressing issue. But people in general are doing pretty well."  </P> <P> Local government, now armed with gasoline tax funds and the half-cent sales tax  increase approved with Measure M last month, is poised to make strides in  curbing traffic congestion and holding down the impact of development. Could  increased optimism about the future be far behind?  </P> <P> "People are feeling there are things they can do that will make a difference,"  Baldassare said. "And perhaps they are feeling that things aren't as dismal as  they appeared to be a few years ago."  </P> <P> </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY ANNUAL SURVEY  </P> <P> Personal Threat of Environmental Problems  </P> <P> How seriously do you view them?  </P> <P> Very serious: 60%  </P> <P> Somewhat Serious: 31%  </P> <P> Not Too Serious: 8%  </P> <P> Don't Know: 1%  </P> <P> Personal Sacrifices to Improve the Environment  </P> <P> What do you do often?  </P> <P> Limit Driving: 35%  </P> <P> Buy Environmentally Safe Products: 52%  </P> <P> Recycle: 68%  </P> <P> Conserve Water: 76%  </P> <P> Source: 1990 Orange County Annual Survey, UCI  </P></p>

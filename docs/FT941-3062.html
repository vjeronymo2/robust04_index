			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / World Commodities Prices: Copper leads metal rally - Market Report After hours 'kerb' trading was active at the London Metal Exchange yesterday today with a strong COPPER market, which ended at 7 1/2 -month peaks, pulling other metals higher. Dealers thought further gains were likely in the short term. ALUMINIUM was bolstered by heavy late buying, and broke through the Dollars 1,320-a-tonne level for three months delivery, where sizeable stop-loss buying orders were triggered. The LEAD and ZINC markets broadly took their cue from the overall trend in base metals, as there were no particular fundamental factors evident to justify strength at present, notably in zinc, dealers said. COFFEE and COCOA futures ended lower at the London Commodity Exchange in a mild correction to recent rallies, though traders said underlying sentiment in both markets remained positive. After a brief attempt to break through the high at Dollars 1,325, May coffee slipped back to end Dollars 7 lower at Dollars 1,310. But its ability to keep above Dollars 1,300 throughout the day led traders to believe the current uptrend was still intact. After a weak start cocoa failed to build up any momentum, staying in the minus column all day. The May position finished Pounds 3 down at Pounds 966 a tonne, Pounds 1 below the day's high. 'We've seen a lot of players taking profits,' said one trader. Compiled from Reuter</p>

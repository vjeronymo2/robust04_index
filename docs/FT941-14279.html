			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / Clinton gives more help to quake victims President Bill Clinton yesterday gave California a Dollars 100m (Pounds 67.5m) advance for earthquake repairs and announced an extension of 100 per cent federal financing for emergency work in the stricken state, Reuter reports. The actions were in addition to the Dollars 140m aid he released on Wednesday for victims of Monday's Los Angeles earthquake. Victims swamped disaster centres with pleas for emergency aid, as authorities worked to find shelter for thousands driven from their homes. With rainstorms on the way and the ground still heaving with aftershocks, officials said they were doing all they could to avoid more loss of life in the aftermath of the quake. The sheriff's department said the death toll had risen to 51, with 4,800 injured and up to Dollars 30bn (Pounds 20.2bn) in damage. More than 20,000 of the region's 'new homeless' - about half of them children - shivered through another cold, damp night in makeshift tent cities in parks and vacant lots. Already worried about deteriorating health conditions, authorities said their top priority was to find them housing before the arrival of rain, forecast for tomorrow night. Storms could also wreak more havoc with the region's crumbled freeway system and with some of the 4,000 homes and businesses damaged or destroyed in the costliest quake in US history, measuring 6.6 on the Richter scale. Cars lined up for miles in traffic jams. Tens of thousands of people were still without power or water. With most big supermarkets boarded up, residents scavenged for food. Governor Pete Wilson wrote to Mr Clinton that losses could range from Dollars 15bn to Dollars 30bn. Louise Kehoe adds: In the wake of the aftershocks, building inspectors will have to re-examine many of the damaged homes and commercial structures that they had previously deemed inhabitable. Schools, most of which remain closed , must similarly be re-inspected. Of 600 schools, over 100 have sustained significant damage, with 24 severely battered with collapsed walls and ceilings.

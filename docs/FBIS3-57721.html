			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Late one evening at the end of last December, at a  Russian Foreign Intelligence Service secret dacha rented by  Arkadiy Volskiy, a meeting was held between Mr. Zhirinovskiy and  the commanders of a number of divisions from the Moscow military  district. This information was reported to MOSKOVSKIY  KOMSOMOLETS by a member of one of the secret services, who also  said that the conference had been of an antipresidential nature.  The officers and generals had questioned why no one had thought  of summoning them to the defense of the White House during the  October mutiny.    Here are some short commentaries by the persons and  organizations named in the newspaper article:    Tatyana Samolis, press secretary to the director of the  Russian Foreign Intelligence Service. I quote her statement:  We have never rented nor are we renting anything to anyone.    Boris Nefedov, leader of Arkadiy Volskiy's group of  consultants: The Russian Union of Industrialists and  Entrepreneurs does not rent any premises of this kind from the  Russian Foreign Intelligence Service, and Zhirinovskiy has never  been in our buildings and did not hold any conferences with  anyone.    As for the views of the military, here is my colleague Anton  Grishin:    [Begin Grishin recording] The military authorities of the  Tamanskaya Division categorically denied the information  supplied in the MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS. The reaction of  representatives of the military authorities of the Dzerzhinskiy  Division only slightly differed from the position of their  Tamanskaya colleagues. It was pointed out to a correspondent  that it was impermissible that rumors of this kind, which bring  Russian officers into disrepute, should be spread.    There does exist, however, an unofficial viewpoint on the  meeting which is reported to have taken place between the leader  of the Liberal Democratic Party and the division's commander.  Thus a number of officers of the Tamanskaya Division, for  instance, did not rule out possibilities of the kind, saying  that if there had been a meeting, then it would explain a great  deal -- among other things, the result of the 12 December  elections. I remind you that an overwhelming majority of the  personnel of the Tamanskaya Division voted for Mr. Zhirinovskiy  at the elections. [end recording]    I can add one more detail to what has already been said.  There is a suspicion that Mr. Zhirinovskiy arrived at the  meeting of military commanders to thank the military in person,  so to speak, for the elections.    By all accounts, the leadership of the Defense Ministry was  not informed that the meeting would take place. However, the  representative of the ministry declined to comment on the  occurence in question, since he did not possess, as he put it,  any information at all. Moreover, the representative of the  press service expressed doubt as to the reliability of the  source used by MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS.</p>

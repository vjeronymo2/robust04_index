			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report The cash LEAD price leapt Pounds 17 to a 13-month high of Pounds 353.50 a tonne on the London Metal Exchange yesterday on news of a strike at the Doe Run Herculaneum smelter in the US. The smelter has an annual capacity of 225,000 short tons (2,000 lb each), and news of the strike immediately lifted prices in mid-afternoon, until which they had been little changed. ZINC prices were also firm, reflecting continuing concern about a tight supply situation created by several producers and a major trader building up a big long position for October delivery. Other LME metals were weaker, led by COPPER, the cash price of which fell Pounds 12 to Pounds 1,309 a tonne as fears of a supply squeeze continued to fade. The three months ALUMINIUM price slipped to Dollars 1,330 a tonne in afterhours trading, Dollars 43 below the 3 1/2 -month high reached earlier in the week. Three months TIN was down Dollars 54 at Dollars 6,815 a tonne Dollars 435 below late-June's 31-month high, while three months NICKEL lost Dollars 72.50 at Dollars 7,492.50 a tonne. COCOA futures ended with pared gains as the market continued to hold in its recent trading range. But concern remained over the possibility of further producer selling. Compiled from Reuters</p>

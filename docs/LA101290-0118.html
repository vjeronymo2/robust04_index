			<p><P> October 12, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW TEXTBOOKS: OUT WITH DULL, IN WITH DIVERSE  </P> <P> They are not like any history books you've ever seen.  </P> <P> American history does not begin with the country's "discovery" by Christopher  Columbus. The Italian explorer is not even introduced until the fifth chapter  of one of the controversial history texts that received approval Thursday from  a key committee of the State Board of Education for use in kindergarten through  eighth grade.  </P> <P> The "melting pot" concept of American diversity taught to generations of  students is tossed out in favor of the "salad bowl" approach. U.S. history is  presented not just through the eyes of European immigrants, but through the  stories of American Indians who were pushed off their land and blacks brought  from Africa and enslaved.  </P> <P> Instead of a few oblique references to religious differences, the textbooks  devote entire chapters to explaining the history, beliefs and customs of  Judaism, Islam and Christianity.  </P> <P> The 5-0 vote Thursday came only from the board's policy and planning committee,  but approval seems almost certain when the full board votes today.  </P> <P> In a departure from traditional textbooks, the new series incorporates lessons  in geography, archeology and language arts. The books -- Houghton Mifflin  social studies for kindergarten through eighth grade and an eighth-grade book  published by Holt, Rinehart &amp; Winston -- are a far cry from the dull  collection of dates and places common to many history texts. The committee also  added an eighth-grade book published by Scott, Foresman &amp; Co.  </P> <P> The new books are chockablock with colorful maps and graphs and rely on  first-person narratives and excerpts from literature by a diverse group of  authors. Students are encouraged to grapple with moral dilemmas and relate  historical events to their own lives, giving history a decidedly personal feel.  </P> <P> A speech by Martin Luther King Jr. is presented early in one of the books to  establish a perspective for thinking about America. Pictures give a sharp  indication of the cruelty and harshness of slave life. Half of a seventh-grade  world history textbook -- compared to about one-third of the current text -- is  devoted to non-Western, non-European studies.  </P> <P> In-depth accounts of tribal life of various American Indian tribes are  included, compared to one or two sentences describing the tribes in current  texts.  </P> <P> The differences, while exciting educators and historians, have brought a  firestorm of protests from ethnic and religious groups, who argue that their  stories are misrepresented or given short shrift. Thursday's committee meeting  was free of such debate because it was not a public hearing.  </P> <P> After complaints from several groups, including representatives of Muslim and  Jewish organizations, gay and lesbian groups, and Asian-American, Latino and  black educators, the publishers made several corrections.  </P> <P> For example, the wording of one passage in a fifth-grade text on exploring the  American West was changed to reflect that John Wesley Powell was not the first  man to walk the length of the Grand Canyon, as had been stated, but the first  white man.  </P> <P> Charlotte Crabtree, professor of education at UCLA who supervised the textbook  review process, said many changes were made in the books in response to  criticisms.  </P> <P> Several Jewish organizations complained about a sentence that read, "a few  Jewish leaders took Jesus before the Roman governor," an action that led to his  crucifixion. This has been changed to, "his opponents took Jesus before the  Roman governor."  </P> <P> The state refused to order other changes to placate complaining groups, some of  which wanted to add "facts" subject to historical dispute, while others wanted  to ignore or minimize sensitive or embarrassing material.  </P> <P> Crabtree said the state did not yield to demands from some black individuals  and organizations that the textbooks' supposed "Eurocentric" bias be replaced  with several different ethnic approaches to teaching U.S. and world history.  </P> <P> State curriculum officials say they expected some uproar over the books because  they take on controversial topics and employ a sophisticated approach. The  breadth of the protests was "unprecedented" and somewhat troubling, said Dan  Chernow of the state Curriculum Commission. "It's a totally new way of looking  at (teaching) history, with an emphasis on geography, strong first-person  accounts, a multicultural approach and lots of narrative," Chernow said.  </P> <P> "The old books say nothing, so there isn't much to criticize," he said. "But  that's the problem; they're bland and they're boring. We wanted something  that's going to excite (children's) interest in history."  </P> <P> Banks reported from Los Angeles and Trombley from Sacramento.  </P></p>

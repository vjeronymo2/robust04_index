			<p><P> December 7, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> AZTEC VOLLEYBALL TEAM PLANS TO GIVE STANFORD THE FULL SERVE  </P> <P> The way Rudy Suwara sees things, every team still alive in the NCAA women's  volleyball playoffs is 1-0.  </P> <P> That's one of the reasons Suwara believes his San Diego State team can upset  Stanford at 8:30 tonight in a West Region semifinal at UCLA's John Wooden  Center.  </P> <P> SDSU (24-11) is the sixth-seeded team in the region. Stanford (26-3) is seeded  second. Top-seeded UCLA (32-1) plays No. 4 New Mexico (22-6) in the other  semifinal at 6:30 p.m. The winners play Saturday at 7:30 p.m.  </P> <P> "Stanford's real good, but in this tournament, they're 1-0 just like us,"  Suwara said.  </P> <P> SDSU became 1-0 by upsetting third-seeded Brigham Young, 3-1, last Friday at  BYU in the first round. Stanford, whose only losses this year were to UCLA  (twice) and Pacific, advanced easily over No. 7 Wyoming, 3-0. SDSU has not  played the Cardinal this season but leads the series 10-6.  </P> <P> "One thing in our favor is we've got one of the best-serving teams in the  nation," Suwara said. "We have Gracie Schutt, who some people think is the  hardest server that's ever been in women's volleyball on the college level.  We've got Sandy Thompson, who also hits a hard spinning serve. We've got Angela  Martin and Kim Lester, who hit really tough flip serves.  </P> <P> "We think our serving, hopefully, will rattle Stanford and throw their passing  off. If we can throw their passing off, we can play with anybody. That was our  game plan against BYU, and that's our game plan against Stanford." JIM LINDGREN  </P></p>

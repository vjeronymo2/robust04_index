			<p>920120 FT  20 JAN 92 / The forgotten virtue of saving Campaigning in New Hampshire, President George Bush promised to unveil a long-term growth package in next week's State of the Union address. Judging from subsequent leaks in Washington, however, the reality will fall far short of the rhetoric. The danger is that Mr Bush will try to buy votes by offering an array of fiscal goodies. The likely menu includes tax relief for first-time home buyers, a tax credit for children or a higher personal exemption, faster depreciation for capital equipment, lower taxes on capital gains and tax credits for medical insurance. Some of this will be offset by proposed cuts in defence spending and the means-testing of some social benefits for higher earners. But the precise details hardly matter, because Mr Bush's budget will be just an opening gambit: a slate on which Congressional Democrats and Republicans will write their demands. Since most legislators are keener on a fiscal stimulus than Mr Bush, they are likely to reject most of the proposed cuts in spending (at least those outside defence) and press for bigger tax cuts. Unless the economy stages a spectacular recovery in the next few months, which seems highly improbable, a sizeable fiscal stimulus - perhaps Dollars 50bn-Dollars 60bn - appears likely. It will be accompanied by pledges on all sides to cut the Dollars 400bn deficit once the recession is over. Now indulge in a flight of fancy. Suppose Mr Bush believed his rhetoric. How could he best improve the US's long-run growth prospects? The answer is simple, dull and highly unpopular: by encouraging Americans to save more and spend less; by mounting a frontal attack on the nation's consumerist culture; by excoriating the prevailing 'me, now' philosophy. By far the biggest economic problem facing the US is the abysmally low level of net national savings. Economists calculate this as the sum of household savings, business savings (ie, increases in retained earnings) and federal, state and local budget surpluses. The 'net' refers to the deductions needed to allow for depreciation of assets, which counts as negative saving. Professor John Shoven of Stanford University recently scrutinised the US savings record in a paper for the American Council for Capital Formation, a Washington think tank. He found net national savings were remarkably constant between 1950 and 1980 at 7-8 per cent of national income. But the ratio plunged to less than 4 per cent in the first half of the 1980s and to only 2 per cent by the end of the decade. He attributes about 2 percentage points of the decline to the swollen budget deficits of recent years and the rest to lower savings by households and companies. There is no international precedent for a collapse of savings on this scale. The UK, for example, enjoyed a comparable consumer boom in the 1980s, but the sharp decline in personal savings was offset (until very recently) by an increase in public savings as the government budget moved into surplus. Between 1980 and 1987, the national savings rate for rich industrialised countries averaged about 9 per cent, while the Japanese savings rate was twice that at nearly 18 per cent. Looked at another way, net national savings represent the expected growth of national wealth. US wealth is about three times national income. A net savings rate of 2 per cent of gross national product (GNP) thus permits national wealth to grow by only two thirds of a percentage point a year, barely enough to keep pace with US population growth. Indeed, Mr Shoven calculates that real net wealth (or capital) per worker actually fell during the 1980s. It was at the same level in 1990 as in 1976. This collapse in savings - and hence in wealth creation - is a fundamental cause of the US's economic stagnation. It threatens to extinguish the American dream of steadily rising living standards. If Mr Bush wants to improve the US's long-run prospects, he must raise the national savings rate. This means abandoning all thought of tax cuts: it ought to be obvious that higher borrowing will not solve problems created by years of excessive deficits. Indeed, in an economy with deficit-fatigue, a Keynesian fiscal stimulus is unlikely to spur growth even in the short run. The best long-term strategy would be to set a goal of increasing net national savings to, say, 10 per cent of national income, or slightly above the average for rich countries. Mr Bush should seek bipartisan support for such a target and for an associated pledge that federal government will do its part to rebuild the nation's savings. How? By striving not merely to reduce the budget deficit but to generate, over time, a sizeable surplus, equivalent to perhaps 2 per cent of GNP. As soon as such a radical pledge became plausible, long-term interest rates would fall sharply, allowing a faster recovery of private investment. The second plank in a pro-savings policy would be a commitment to radical tax reform. The most striking aspect of US taxation is the minimal reliance on consumption taxes. The US is almost alone in lacking a national value added tax. The introduction of a European-style VAT would enable the federal government to increase taxes almost painlessly (thus moving towards its goal of a budget surplus), while spurring growth by lowering the effective rate of taxation on income and capital. Perhaps the US should now stop kidding itself and face a hard truth: it can only grow faster in the future if it consumes less of its national income today.</p>

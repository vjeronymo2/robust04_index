			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / International Company News: Fourth-quarter rise at Sara Lee SARA LEE, the Chicago-based food and consumer products company, yesterday reported an 11.8 increase in fourth-quarter profits to Dollars 190m after tax. Sales advanced by 13.3 per cent to Dollars 3.85bn. The final-quarter's results left Sara Lee posting an underlying 12.9 per cent advance in earnings per share to Dollars 1.40 for the 12 months to July 3. Net profits actually showed a small fall from Dollars 761m to Dollars 704m, but the previous year's results included a one-off pre-tax gain from the sale of the over-the-counter drugs business, only partially offset by some restructuring costs. This added a net Dollars 222m to the 1991-2 results at the pre-tax level. In the final quarter, the only weak division was personal products, where operating profits fell by 4.3 per cent to Dollars 144m, on sales 12.8 per cent higher at Dollars 1.54bn. Sara Lee, which takes in brand-names such as Hanes, L'eggs and Dim, said that markets were depressed in Europe, especially in the hosiery area. Elsewhere, operating profits on the household and personal care side surged by 45.7 per cent to Dollars 48m, on a 4.7 per cent sales gain to Dollars 351m. The group said that this reflected increased sales of higher margin 'core category products and improved operating efficiencies'. On the food side, the packaged meats and bakery division advanced by 6.4 per cent, to an operating profit of Dollars 93m, on sales up by one-fifth at Dollars 1.44bn. The coffee and grocery business improved operating profits by 9.2 per cent to Dollars 66m, with sales rising by 3.7 per cent to Dollars 517m. For the year overall, Sara Lee saw a 10.1 per cent advance in sales to Dollars 14.6bn. The company's shares advanced modestly on the results, adding Dollars 1/4 to Dollars 21 5/8.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Quito, 28 May (EFE) -- The Maoist group "Inti Puka"  ("Red Sun" in Quechua) that is similar to the Peruvian terrorist  Shining Path movement claimed responsibility on Saturday, 28  May, for the attack on an energy tower that left the water  processing plant that supplies half the city of Quito without  electricity.    In anonymous telephone calls to local radio stations,  persons  who claimed to belong to the "Red Sun" said the attack is to  protest the privatization plan implemented by the government of  conservative Sixto Duran-Ballen.    The attack, with three dynamite charges, downed an energy  tower in the outskirts of this city, leaving the Papallacta  water processing plant without electricity. This plant provides  water to almost half of Quito's 1.5 million inhabitants.    On several occasions civilian and military authorities have  announced the dismantling of the "Red Sun," which has claimed  responsibility for tens of bomb attacks in past years. Until now  there have been no victims.    "We want to stress that we exist and that we will continue  operating clandestinely against the government," one of the  alleged terrorists who called the radio stations affirmed.</p>

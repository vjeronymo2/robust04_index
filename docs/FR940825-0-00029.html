Chapter 35 and have been assigned OMB control number 0575&hyph;0042 in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3507). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Please send written comments to the Office of Information Regulatory Affairs, OMB, Attention: Desk Officer for USDA, Washington, D.C. 20503. Please send a copy of your comments to Jack Holston, Agency Clearance Officer, USDA, FmHA, Ag Box 0743, Washington, DC 20250.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Presently, FmHA requires that all drawings and specifications for housing loan and grant applications involving new construction and conditional commitments be prepared to comply with the thermal requirements of Exhibit D of FmHA Instruction 1924&hyph;A.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 509(a) of the Housing Act of 1949, in conjunction with Section 109 of the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act as amended by the Energy Policy Act of 1992 require the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the Secretary of Agriculture (USDA) to jointly establish by rule energy efficiency standards for new construction of SFH subject to mortgages insured, guaranteed, or made by the Secretary of Agriculture under Title V of the Housing Act of 1949. Such standards shall meet or exceed the requirements of CABO MEC&hyph;92. However, if the Secretaries have not, within 1 year after the date of enactment of the Energy Policy Act of 1992, established energy efficiency standards, all new construction of SFH shall meet the requirements of CABO MEC&hyph;92. USDA and HUD have consulted in jointly establishing energy efficiency standards but as of this date have not jointly established such standards. This Rule establishes the CABO MEC&hyph;92 as the FmHA requirement for new construction of single family housing (other than manufactured homes) subject to mortgages insured, guaranteed, or made by the Secretary of Agriculture under title V of the Housing Act of 1949. The CABO/MEC&hyph;92 requirements are comparable to the FmHA thermal requirements for new SFH construction previously in effect.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to the changes to the regulation required by the Energy Policy Act of 1992, the certification of compliance with development standards has been removed from the text of the regulation and moved to an FmHA form. The only change in the substance of the certification has been to add certification of compliance with the applicable energy standard from Exhibit D to this regulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 109 of the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act does not require CABO MEC&hyph;92 for MFH or existing SFH. Therefore, the FmHA thermal requirements in FmHA Instruction 1924&hyph;A, Exhibit D will continue to be used for MFH and existing SFH construction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

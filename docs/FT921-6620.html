			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / Sikorski appointment contested Another political row has broken around the Polish government following the appointment of Mr Radek Sikorski, a 29-year-old naturalised British citizen and a former Warsaw correspondent of the London Sunday Telegraph, as a deputy defence minister. President Lech Walesa served notice that he would contest a decision widely criticised by press and politicians. Mr Sikorski obtained British citizenship after leaving Poland during the martial law period. 'As a loyal citizen of the British crown will he be an equally loyal citizen of the Polish republic when he gets access to the most confidential state secrets?' asked the mass circulation Gazeta Wyborcza newspaper. Over the past year Mr Sikorski worked as a consultant in Warsaw for media magnate Rupert Murdoch. Control over the armed forces remains a sensitive political issue. Last month the government's decision to chose a civilian defence minister, Mr Jan Parys, to replace replace Admiral Piotr Kolodziejczk brought it into conflict with Mr Walesa. The president wanted to reassure the military by keeping one of their number at the head of the defence ministry. The government was equally keen to show that it is intent in severing the links with Poland's communist past.</p>

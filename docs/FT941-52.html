			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / International Company News: BHF-Bank advances 20% The BHF-Bank group yesterday reported an increase of 20.5 per cent in net operating profits for 1993, and said it was 'cautiously optimistic' about prospects for the current financial year. Partial operating earnings, which exclude income from own-account trading, rose 27.6 per cent to DM370m (Dollars 222m) last year, while group-wide provisions against bad debts were increased 45 per cent to DM168m. The lion's share of the provisions were made in the BHF-Bank itself, reflecting precautionary moves made elsewhere in the German banking industry to take account of an expected increase in the number of corporate borrowers suffering in the wake of recession. Mr Wolfgang Strutz, managing partner, pointed out that the year's total provisions were within the range expected at the start of last year. A third of the bank's earnings, and 30 per cent of group income came from outside Germany, he told a press conference. The bank's business volume rose 17 per cent last year to DM63.3bn and credit volume increased by a similar proportion to DM46.7bn. Interest earnings rose 15 per cent to DM619m, while own-account trading at the bank and subsidiaries in securities, currencies and derivatives generated DM127m income - up 32 per cent on the previous year.</p>

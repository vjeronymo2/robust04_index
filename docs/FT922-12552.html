			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / City analysts 'largely ignore' annual reports CITY ANALYSTS pay little attention to company accounts, an academic survey of the users and preparers of the primary financial document has concluded. The annual report was ranked only the fifth most important source of information for analysts after preliminary and interim statements, personal interviews and company presentations, three academics told the British Accounting Association annual conference. This was held at the University of Warwick, and finished yesterday. Mr Roger Hussey, Mr David Bence and Ms Catherine Wilkie of Bristol Business School found that preparers and users view the annual report very differently. Their work showed that 91 per cent of analysts perceived the objective of the report as being to comply with legal requirements, and 71 per cent as being to present a good image of the company. Only a third thought the aim was to provide information for investment decisions or to give shareholders an indication of the company's value. Most analysts claimed the notes to the financial statements, the group profit and loss account, group balance sheet and the cashflow statement were the most important items in the report. But few appeared to scrutinise accounts for bad accounting practice. Mr Tony Brinn, Mr Mike Peel and Mr Roydon Roberts, from Cardiff Business School, told the conference that audit fees increased with the size and complexity of unquoted companies and were lower outside London and south-east England. In a study of 77 independent electrical goods and electronics companies, they found that the fees charged by the biggest eight audit firms were higher than those of other auditors. They also found that audit fees were lower than for comparable unquoted businesses which are subsidiaries of other companies. A survey of practitioners in Australia, by Mr Kevin Adams and Mr David Kimber from the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology, showed that the vast majority of auditors want a limit on their liability in cases of professional negligence. The Accounting Standards Board is restructuring the way it arbitrates contentious accounting practices following complaints from companies that the mechanism is undemocratic, it emerged yesterday. The changes will affect the operation of the urgent issues task force, which was established by the ASB last year to give swift rulings on the legitimacy of accounting practices as soon as they emerged. The task force will publicise the subjects it is considering more widely, produce an interim discussion of a subject and then allow at least a month for additional consultation before its binding 'abstract' on a topic is released. The move follows complaints from businesses that they have been taken by surprise at the speed and impact of previous task force pronouncements.</p>

			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / Letter: Looked at another way Sir, September 29 this year will be the last five-figure palindrome date in this millennium - 29.9.92. The next one will be January 10 2001, or 10.1.01. There will be seven four-figure palindrome dates in Septembers, starting 3.9.93 and ending 9.9.99. I thought you might like to know.

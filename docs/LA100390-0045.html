			<p><P> October 3, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: SAN DIEGO STILL HAS WHAT IT TAKES TO BE A GHOST TOWN  </P> <P> Be advised that San Diego County is amply represented in the new book "Haunted  Houses of California: A Ghostly Guide."  </P> <P> That's real haunted houses -- apparitions, ectoplasm, restless dead people,  mysterious goings-on, etc. -- not the Halloween type.  </P> <P>  The book is by author Antoinette May, who grew up in La Jolla and writes a  horoscope column for the San Francisco Chronicle. She's best known for her  biographies of novelist Helen Hunt Jackson and war correspondent Marguerite  Higgins.  </P> <P> May identifies as San Diego County's poltergeist centers:  </P> <P> * Rancho Jamul, built in 1852. Strange lights, cold spots, crying Indians,  screaming women.  </P> <P> * The Thomas Whaley House, built in 1857, in Old Town, once a site for public  executions. Ghostly men in frock coats, weird women in calico dresses.  </P> <P> * Casa de Estudillo, built in 1829, in Old Town. Faces in mirrors, flashes of  red light.  </P> <P> * Hotel del Coronado, room 502, doors closing, noises, lights, strange  occurences, maybe from a hushed-up society suicide in the 1920s.  </P> <P> * The Fallbrook Enterprise office. A little girl in a red dress is seen  occasionally and vanishes, maybe from a long-ago family.  </P> <P> At five, San Diego has one more haunted house than all of Los Angeles.  </P> <P> May, 47, who lives in Palo Alto, explained in a telephone interview that the  history of San Diego County has all the fixings for wandering spirits.  </P> <P> "San Diego was a frontier town, with lots of violence, confusion, political  feuding and discord," she said. "That's what generates the energy necessary for  an atmosphere where spirits thrive."  </P> <P> Violence, confusion, political feuding and discord as the ingredients for  spooky stuff?  </P> <P> If so, San Diego these days must be cooking an entire subdivision of haunted  houses.  </P> <P> "I see no reason why not," May said. She's already trying to track down a  modern haunting in Mission Hills.  </P> <P> </P> <P> For Something a Little Different  </P> <P> The best of everything.  </P> <P> * No chicken and peas, please.  </P> <P> Kara Kobey may not be elected to the governing board of San Diego Community  College. But her fund-raiser next Sunday seems destined to be the season's best  buffet:  </P> <P> Ceasar salad; rigatoni with four cheeses; canelloni Avanti; tortellini with  walnuts, mushroom, cream and Parmesan; eggplant parmigiana; penne (macaroni)  and spicy tomato sauce, and focaccia bread with onion and tomato.  </P> <P> * The Lakeside-based Animal Press is tilting toward Dianne Feinstein in the  governor's race.  </P> <P> Feinstein opposes puppy mills and supports putting animal-rights advocates on  the Fish and Game Commission. Pete Wilson is mum.  </P> <P> An irate voter called Pete Wilson's San Diego office to check a rumor that if  Wilson is elected governor he'll appoint Sunny Bonno to his Seante seat.  </P> <P> Answer: No.  </P> <P> * With a week to go before the deadline, the drive to recall San Deigo  Councilwoman Linda Bernhardt has only two-thirds of the signatures needed to  force an election.  </P> <P> * North County bumper sticker: "When in despair, hug your bear."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Putting a Claw on Glasnost  </P> <P> For seven years, Larry Lobster was a regular at the Old Globe Theatre.  </P> <P> The 18-inch plastic lobster made his debut in the feast scene of the 1982  production of "The Tempest." Then he became a good-luck charm and was hidden on  stage for each new play.  </P> <P> But he vanished after "Brothers and Sisters," last year's offering from the  Maly Drama Theatre of Leningrad. A search was futile.  </P> <P> Globe technical director Loren Schreiber has now just returned from a trip to  the Maly.  </P> <P> Yes, he spotted Larry on stage. He also decided Larry should remain in  Leningrad.  </P> <P> Reason: An ersatz crustacean is a small price to pay for glasnost, dramatically  speaking.  </P></p>

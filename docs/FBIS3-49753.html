			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Sarajevo's state hospital was today hit by three  120-mm artillery projectiles for the fourth time this year. A  letter from Bosnia-Herzegovina Defense Minister Hamdija  Hadzihasanovic to General Briquemont, commander in chief of the  UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] for Bosnia-Herzegovina, says  five people staying in the hospital were seriously wounded and  one was killed in the immediate vicinity of the hospital. Given  the 500 direct artillery hits in 1992 and the 15 in 1993, it  seems, if the current rate of shelling is anything to go by,  that this year's shelling will exceed the level achieved in the  first year of war.    Mr. General, you know well that the state hospital in  Sarajevo is a civilian facility and you are also aware of its  importance. This is why we lodge once again our sharpest  protest over this crime by the Serbian aggressor, which you are  quietly observing and logging. The Bosnia-Herzegovina defense  minister ends his letter by saying: I call on you to react to  such attacks in an adequate manner.</p>

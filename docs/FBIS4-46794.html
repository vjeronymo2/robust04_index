			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Edict No 197/94 of President L. Kravchuk of Ukraine "On </F> Measures To Decrease Currency in Circulation," signed by  President Kravchuk in Kiev on 29 April 1994]    [Text] For the purpose of normalizing monetary circulation  and reducing the rate of increase in the amount of money put  into circulation, I hereby decree that:    1. All juridical persons within the territory of Ukraine,  irrespective of property status and type of activity, and  physical persons--citizens of Ukraine, foreign citizens, and  stateless individuals--participating in business activity will  do the following:    --make separate settlements with one another for goods,  work,  services, and securities costing more than six times the minimum  wage only in non-cash forms. The amount of money issued by banks  within a calendar month to enterprises, institutions, and  organizations with up to 3,000 employees for current expenses  will not exceed 15 times the minimum wage, or 30 times the  minimum wage in the case of those with over 3,000 employees.  Currency for business-related travel expenses will not be  included among current expenses and will be issued by the banks  according to the established procedure;    --keep currency in their cash funds within the established  limits. The procedure for setting limits on the amount of cash  on hand and for organizing the oversight of their observance  will be defined by the National Bank of Ukraine;    --keep currency in excess of established limits in their  cash  funds only for the payment of wages, social insurance benefits,  stipends, and pensions and only for a period of no more than  three working days, including the date of receipt of the  currency in banking establishments.    The second paragraph of this section will not apply to the  settlements of collective agricultural enterprises and farmers  with trade organizations and enterprises.    The provisions of the third and fourth paragraphs of this  section will not apply to physical persons engaged in business  activity.    2. The limits on the amount of currency kept in cash funds  for juridical persons will be decided by the commercial banks  serving them on the basis of financial reports submitted by  these juridical persons. In the absence of these reports, the  limits will be set autonomously by the commercial banks.    Commercial banks will issue currency only on valid grounds  and will oversee the use of this currency for the designated  purpose.    3. Juridical and physical persons engaged in the purchase of  agricultural products, wild fruits and berries, medicinal herbs,  waste paper, rags, glass, and scrap metal from the population  and juridical persons conducting pawning operations will receive  currency for the full amount of settlements with the population.    Motor transport enterprises and organizations (enterprises  and organizations specializing in the performance of transport  services) offering inter-oblast transport services will receive  currency to cover the cost of fuel to be purchased outside the  oblasts where these enterprises and organizations are located.    Expenditures of funds advanced for the purchase of products  (or to cover the cost of fuel) will be overseen by commercial  banks.    The amounts owed to citizens for the products they sell may  be deposited in savings accounts only at the request of the  citizens.    4. Banking establishments will issue funds to juridical  persons conducting insurance operations for the payment of  insured amounts (the coverage of claims) connected with  voluntary and compulsory insurance contracts in non-cash forms,  with the exception of the following:    amounts subject to payment in cash to citizens after the  expiration of insurance contracts or their early termination;    compensatory payments to citizens in the form of insured  amounts and claims.    5. Enterprises, institutions, and organizations, including  trade organizations engaging in regular currency trading  operations and relying on them for the payment of wages and  pensions and the purchase of agricultural products will be  entitled to keep currency over and above expenditure limits in  their cash funds only for three working days prior to the  payment date.    6. The observance of the requirements of this edict by  juridical persons, with the exception of commercial banks, and  physical persons engaged in business activity will be overseen  by commercial banks, agencies of the Ukrainian State Tax  Service, the State Auditing Service, and the Ministry of  Internal Affairs.    The observance of the requirements of this edict by  commercial banks will be overseen by institutions of the  National Bank of Ukraine.    7. Sales of non-food items to citizens by trade  organizations  and other enterprises and organizations, as well as settlements  with physical persons acting as the agents for goods sold on  commission or consignment (per unit or lot, irrespective of the  type and category of commodity) at a cost exceeding 200 times  the minimum wage will be conducted with the use of Ukrainian  bank checks or transfers to personal accounts.    No service fees will be charged on bank checks issued to  citizens and on transfers to their personal accounts in excess  of 200 times the minimum wage.    8. State tax inspectors will impose financial penalties on  enterprises, institutions, and organizations, irrespective of  property status and type of activity, and physical persons  engaged in business activity for violations of the requirements  of this edict, in the form of fines in the amount of the  settlement operations or currency in cash funds exceeding the  limit, on the basis of the information of their own audits and  information submitted by commercial banks, the State Auditing  Service, and agencies of the Ukrainian Ministry of Internal  Affairs and the National Bank of Ukraine.    The parties liable for violations of the requirements of the  second paragraph of Section 1 of this edict in reference to the  separate settlements will be the juridical and physical persons  making the payments in cash.    Commercial banks violating the requirements of this edict  will be subject to financial penalties, on the recommendation of  the National Bank of Ukraine, in the form of fines of the  following types:    for the failure to set limits on currency in cash funds--a  fine equivalent to 50 times the minimum wage for each incident;    for the issuance of currency without valid grounds--a fine  in  the amount of the sums issued.    The fines stipulated in this section will be collected  without recourse and deposited in the state budget.    The procedure for implementing the provisions of this edict  will be defined by the Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers in  conjunction with the National Bank of Ukraine.    [Signed] L. Kravchuk, President of Ukraine    Kiev, 29 April 1994, No 197/94</p>

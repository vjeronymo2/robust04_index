			<p>940829 FT  29 AUG 94 / International Company News: Fonorola to become national carrier Fonorola, the Canadian telecommunications reseller, plans to turn itself into Canada's third national long-distance carrier, writes Robert Gibbens. At present the company leases facilities from the other big carriers, Stentor and Unitel, at wholesale prices and provides enhanced services to business customers at prices below the telephone companies' rates. Now Fonorola has formed a limited partnership with Canadian National Railways to develop CN's existing 1,500-mile trans-Canada fibre-optic network running beside its tracks between Montreal and Vancouver. Fonorola will also get access to other CN private systems in Canada and the US, as far south as Cincinnati. It will invest CDollars 15m cash in the partnership and arrange supplier finance for a CDollars 50m upgrade of the CN fibre-optic network. Canadian National Railways said its role would be passive but it wanted to 'maximise an under-utilised asset'. It built the system in the early 1980s to manage its rail network more efficiently.</p>

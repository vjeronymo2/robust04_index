			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / Arts: Today's Television Coverage of the First Test against New Zealand at Trent Bridge starts this morning at 10.55 on BBC1. Afternoon play begins on BBC2 at 1.45, and the same channel shows highlights at 11.20 pm. There is also ball by ball commentary on Test Match Special on Radio 4 long wave, which is not the same without the late Brian Johnston, bless his chocolate cakes. Yet it is still a unique programme, and aficionados will, as ever, watch television with the sound turned down and listen to the radio commentary, which begins at 11.00 am. At 8.00 pm BBC1 is repeating an episode from the 1977 series Secret Army in which Bernard Hepton played the owner of a Belgian restaurant which served as HQ for the resistance. It was this series more than real events which gave rise to the comedy 'Allo Allo'. A new gardening series on Channel 4, Over The Garden Wall, looks at the natural conditions in various parts of Britain and at how wild plants have adapted to them (9.00). The day's best movie is The Scarlet Empress with Dietrich as Catherine The Great (12.30 BBC2).</p>

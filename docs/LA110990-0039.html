			<p><P> November 9, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INSURANCE FRAUD RINGS  </P> <P> Your story about the auto accident fraud brought a question to mind. Does the  insurance company that paid out the money for the claims now check all those  cases and return their insureds to a list of "good drivers"?  </P> <P> Many of these insureds have been placed with assigned-risk companies, forcing  them to pay higher premiums. If they were not at fault, the insurance company  should be prohibited from this action.  </P> <P> My own insurance -- liability only on a 9-year-old compact car -- is more than  $100 per month, due to just such an accident a year ago. I need a new car, but  I cannot afford the insurance premium for full coverage. I believe the incident  was a fraudulent one, but I could not convince the insurance company. If it  really was fraudulent, should I not be reimbursed for the extra premiums I have  paid?  </P> <P> Insurance companies have become lazy and non-caring because they are so well  protected by the state.  </P> <P> MARY J.

			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / International Company News: Earnings dive at Turner Broadcasting COSTS associated with coverage of the winter Olympics contributed to a sharp decline in first-quarter net earnings at Turner Broadcasting System, the media and entertainment group that controls the CNN cable network. Although revenues were 12 per cent higher at Dollars 365.2m, the first-quarter net profit was only Dollars 731,000 , against Dollars 3.8m a year ago. At the operating level the profit dropped by 9 per cent to Dollars 51.1m. Revenues for the entertainment division of Mr Ted Turner's company rose by 20 per cent to Dollars 170.5m thanks to increases in subscription revenue and advertising at the TNT cable network. But the entertainment unit's operating profit fell to Dollars 16.1m from Dollars 27.9m in the first quarter of last year. Operating profits from the news division - which includes CNN - increased to Dollars 42.4m from Dollars 31.1m on revenues that were 9 per cent higher at Dollars 125.3m. Losses on the sports division, which includes an equity stake in the Atlanta Hawks basketball team, rose to nearly Dollars 4m from Dollars 2.1m a year ago. The New York Times, whose delivery drivers have been on strike since last week, said yesterday the strike had cost millions of dollars. Mr Lance Primis, president of the paper, said the losses consisted of plant and equipment damage, lost sales and rebates to advertisers. Mr Primis said he was unaware of distribution problems spreading beyond the suburban areas of Westchester County and Long Island in New York and in Connecticut.</p>

			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / Staff rights stressed in white paper: Government wants employees to have more details of terms and conditions THE GOVERNMENT yesterday issued a 'United Kingdom Social Charter', stressing rights for the individual at work and new training opportunities. The main piece of new legislation planned in the employment white paper requires that individual employment contracts give employees more details of their terms and conditions. The white paper supplements plans for another round of restrictions on trade unions in an earlier green paper. The white paper also plans to make the poaching of skilled workers more difficult. The government wants to encourage legally enforceable contracts which would allow employers to recoup some of the cost of training if an employee leaves within a certain period. In both areas the government will consult before legislating. In the field of training the main new ideas are to extend the credits concept to careers advice for adults in work wishing to expand their employment opportunities and to provide 'open learning' vouchers, in conjunction with libraries, for the unemployed. Mr Michael Howard, employment secretary, told the House of Commons, to derisive Labour laughter, that the training proposals would be paid for out of existing budgets. The 'skill-check' credit scheme will cost Pounds 25m over the next 2 years and will be launched experimentally in 15 Training and Enterprise Councils. The white paper is a highly political argument against the employment proposals of the Labour party and the European Community Social Charter. However, it implicitly acknowledges the impact of Labour's accusation that the Conservative employment agenda was merely negative 'union-bashing'. It also borrows from Labour's new emphasis on individual rights in relation to the employer, as opposed to the recent Conservative emphasis on individual rights in relation to the trade union. Many of the original green paper proposals are still there, including the right of employees to join the union of their choice regardless of the Trades Union Congress rulings. Other green paper proposals in the white paper are a right to more financial information about unions (including the salaries of top officials) and protection for union members from abuse of 'automatic check-off' of union dues. The white paper stresses the superiority of individual dealings with employers rather than 'distant negotiations between employers and a trade union', hence the new detail that employers will probably have to provide in employment contracts. That detail goes beyond what is required through adoption of the EC's Directive on Proof of Employment Relationships. Mr Howard cited as proof that collective bargaining was no longer effective the fact that people covered by collective bargaining now earned on average Pounds 7.50 a week less than those not so covered. Pay analysts pointed out, however, that white-collar pay had grown three times faster than manual pay in the 1980s. Mr Tony Blair, Labour's employment spokesman, criticised the plan to make employees liable for the cost of their training but said it was 'a fundamental concession' to the Labour view that a voluntary approach on training was insufficient. Mr Howard said that he expected that poaching employers would 'buy out' an employee from a contract. However, in this and other areas where individual contracts will become more important, the white paper envisages a greater influence for industrial tribunals.

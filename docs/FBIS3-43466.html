The minister, who did not give details on the incidents that  took place at the borders, made this statement before leaving  Lagos for Yaounde, where he arrived this afternoon.    Nigeria is determined to maintain close bilateral ties with  Cameroon, he added, while stressing that his government "will no  longer tolerate harassement of Nigerian nationals in neighboring  countries," NAN added with no more details.    Neither the radio nor the national television mentioned Mr.  Kingibe's departure for Cameroon this afternoon. [passage  omitted]    A military joint commission was created in 1986 to delimit  the final demarcation of the border between the two countries.  In August 1992, following repeated border incidents,  Cameroonian Defense Minister Edouard Akame Mfoumou, held  discussions on the issue with his then Nigerian counterpart,  General Sani Abacha, now Nigeria's current head of state.</p>

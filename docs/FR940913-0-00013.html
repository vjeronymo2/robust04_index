			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Nectarine Administrative Committee (NAC) recommended revision of the handling requirements for California nectarines, and the Peach Commodity Committee (PCC) recommended revision of the handling requirements for California peaches. These committees meet prior to and during each season to review the rules and regulations effective on a continuous basis for California nectarines and peaches under the orders. These committee meetings are open to the public, and interested persons may express their views at these meetings. The Department reviews committee recommendations and information, as well as information from other sources, and determines whether modification, suspension, or termination of the rules and regulations would tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This rule finalizes two interim final rules that revised the handling requirements for nectarines in &sect;916.350 California Nectarine Container and Pack Regulation [7 CFR 916.350], and in &sect;916.365 California Nectarine Grade and Size Regulation [7 CFR 916.365], and for peaches in &sect;917.442 California Peach Container and Pack Regulation [7 CFR 917.442] and in &sect;917.459 California Peach Grade and Size Regulation [7 CFR 917.459]. The first interim final rule was issued on March 29, 1994, and published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  [59 FR 15835, April 5, 1994], and the second interim final rule was issued on June 9, 1994, and published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  [59 FR 31118, June 17, 1994].  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The first interim final rule provided a 30-day comment period ending May 5, 1994, and two comments were received. The first comment received was from John Kovacevich, Jr., a California peach grower and shipper, requesting a change in the peach grade requirements to permit handlers to ship peaches with additional amounts of open sutures. The change requested by this commentor was included in the first interim final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The second comment received was from Harold McClarty of The HMC Group of Kingsburg, California, supporting the weight-count revisions made in the handling requirements for fresh nectarines and peaches by the first interim final rule, since such revisions will be beneficial when they packed fruit in volume-filled containers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The second interim final rule provided a 30-day comment period ending July 18, 1994, and one comment was received. The comment was received from Gary W. Van Sickle, Field Director for the PCC and the NAC, reaffirming the PCC's and the NAC's support of the revised pack requirements contained in the second interim final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Periods (Nectarines)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The first interim final rule amended paragraph (a) in &sect;916.350 and paragraph (a) in &sect;916.356 to change the regulatory periods in each of these sections to April 1 through October 31 each year, so that all nectarine shipments made each season are covered by these regulatory requirements. Correspondingly, paragraph (a)(7) of &sect;916.356 was revised to change the beginning date of the regulatory requirements to April 1 from April 15 each year. Handlers ship fresh nectarines during the April 1&hyph;April 15 period when the harvest season begins early. The NAC unanimously recommended this change. Prior to amendment, &sect;&sect;916.350 and 916.356 were effective for the period April 15 through October 31 each year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Container and Pack Requirements (Nectarines)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 916.350 specifies container and pack requirements for fresh nectarine shipments. Paragraph (a)(4)(iv) of &sect;916.350 specifies the tray-pack size designations which must be marked on loose-filled or tight-filled containers, depending on the size of the fruit. The size designations specify the maximum number of nectarines in a 16-pound sample for each tray-pack size designation. The first interim final rule revised paragraph (a)(4)(iv) of &sect;916.350 by modifying Table I to specify weight-count standards for early-season and mid-season nectarine varieties, and by adding a new Table 2 to specify weight-count standards for late-season nectarine varieties.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NAC recommended these revised container marking requirements for nectarines after a comprehensive review of the appropriate size pack-count relationships between the tray-pack containers and loose-filled or tight-filled containers for all nectarine varieties. The revised provisions more precisely reflect the characteristics of different varieties of fruit during the course of the season.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The first interim final rule also revised &sect;916.350 by adding a proviso to paragraph (a)(4)(iv), and revises &sect;916.356 by redesignating current paragraph (b) as (c) and adding a new paragraph (b) to that section. These revisions specify the procedure to be used in determining whether nectarines meet the minimum size requirements specified for each size category in this section when applying the 16-pound sample requirements. Under this procedure, a sample consisting of one-half of the number of fruit specified for a 16-pound sample for a particular size category shall be used, provided such sample weighs at least 8 pounds. When one-half the specified number of fruit in a sample results in a number ending with one-half a fruit, the smaller full number of fruit is used to determine the sample weight. If a sample fails with respect to minimum size requirements on the basis of an 8-pound sample, a full 16-pound sample must be used to determine if the fruit meets minimum size requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NAC recommended this sampling procedure change after determining that the size of nectarines could be adequately determined by using an 8-pound sample in most instances, and finding that application of this procedure would reduce inspection time and inspection costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The second interim final rule further revised &sect;916.350 by adding a new proviso to paragraph (a)(1) specifying that the nectarines in any volume-filled container need only be filled to within one inch of the top of the container. The second interim final rule also removed the proviso in paragraph (a)(1) of &sect;916.350 reading ``That nectarines in any container shall be fairly uniform in size'', because such requirements are included within the definition of ``standard pack'' in the United States Standards for Grades of Nectarines, and therefore are not needed in this paragraph.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NAC recommended these revised pack requirements for fresh nectarines in volume-filled containers after a comprehensive review of changes in the nectarine industry packing practices over the years, and the need to make appropriate changes in the pack requirements to reduce bruising of the fruit due to excessively tight packs. The revision provided handlers with more flexibility in packing their nectarines and selecting the appropriate size container for certain volume-filled packs to help prevent fruit bruising. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

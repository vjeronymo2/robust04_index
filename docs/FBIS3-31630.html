			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Affairs Minister Vladislav Jovanovic </F> by Dragan Colovic on the "An Argument More" program; place and  date not given -- recorded]    [Text] [Colovic] Good day, Mr. Jovanovic.    [Jovanovic] Good day.    [Colovic] The news that there is no need for a military  intervention by NATO in Sarajevo has been received and met with  great relief, both in the country and in the world. In your  opinion, who and what should be given credit for such a positive  denouement?    [Jovanovic] One should, above all, give credit to the  consistent and courageous peace-loving policy that the Serbs in  Bosnia and we in Yugoslavia have persistently been conducting in  order to overcome and solve the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina.  This peace-loving policy could not but meet with a reaction  among those people who are also interested in a peaceful  solution: First, Russia, but also other countries -- Greece and  others -- who all had uneasy feelings about the possibility that  NATO's reckless policy in this crisis could upset the balance  and all the conditions for creating regional stability. This is  why the agreement on a cease- fire has been accompanied by the  agreement on the demilitarization of Sarajevo, which had been  reached before issuing this hapless ultimatum that really  appeared to be a shot in the dark. It was simply, as Mr.  Karadzic put it, like walking through an open door [as heard].  This leads us to conclude that NATO also had other goals that  it hoped to achieve with this ultimatum rather than influencing  the solving of the crisis. It also had internal needs to  reaffirm itself under the conditions of having lost its enemy  and through aggravating the crisis in Bosnia, to strengthen its  internal ranks, which were seriously threatened by the lack of  outside danger. Therefore, the fact that peace was again  maintained due to the presence of mind and principled stand of  the Bosnian Serbs and us, as well as other peace-loving forces  in the international community, is now a common good that....    [Colovic, interrupting] should be preserved.    [Jovanovic] That should be preserved and strengthened so  that strikes against the peace process will not be able to be  (?repeated), such as the most recent one that could have  permanently halted the peace process if one had failed to take  care of it.    [Colovic] Mr. Jovanovic, what will it depend on that this  positive moment could be taken advantage of for new and even  more decisive steps toward peace, not only in the former  Bosnia-Herzegovina but also in the broader territories of the  former Yugoslavia?    [Jovanovic] This reasonableness, responsibility, and  experience in approaching a tense and critical situation should  certainly be preserved and increased. However, one should  immediately be warned that dangers to the present peace still  exist. They may, above all, come from the Muslim side, which is  inclined to carry out all sorts of diversions -- both staged and  not -- against peace. One should also be wary of the leading  Western factors that are continuing, and even intensifying, the  unbalanced approach to solving the Bosnian crisis. These are  two negative aspects that are still present, despite the  regressing of the present crisis, and that could greatly damage  the peace process if they acted freely. Moreover, it is very  important that this peace process be continued and that this  positive example of Sarajevo be used to reduce tension and  demilitarization in other regions in which battles are still  being waged or which could be dangerous for the peace process.  When all this is accomplished, then this just and permanent  peace that has long been talked about would really be at an  arm's length. Let me warn you, however, that the advocators of  ultimatums, of a forced and unjust solution, are still thinking  about imposing this solution by using political and other forces.    [Colovic] Yes. Mr. Jovanovic, while you are on this topic,  what else is equally important to strengthen this positive  trend? I am mainly referring to what you have just mentioned --  that there are still people who would like to throw a monkey  wrench into the wheels of this peace process, which has  obviously been strengthened.    [Jovanovic] The forces that are in favor of this process, of  reaching a balanced and just political solution to the crisis in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, should become even more active and should be  the very side to impose the tone for further negotiations. It  should not be those forces who want to use the peace process to  sabotage it and persuade the world that the war option is the  only one for solving the crisis.    On the other hand, it is necessary to intensify our contacts  with old and new neighbors who are also increasingly more  interested in reaching this just and lasting peace. In this  sense, we have permanent contacts with all our (?permanent)  earlier neighbors, except for Albania, although we are open for  contacts with this country as well. An envoy is visiting Turkey  today and will hold political consultations with the Turkish  Ministry of Foreign Affairs. We also hope to have more dynamic  contacts with other neighboring countries [as heard].    Finally, in this context are also efforts to normalize our  relations with Croatia in a way that would equally respect the  legitimate rights and interest of the Serbian people in Krajina.    [Colovic] Mr. Jovanovic, I thank you very much on behalf of  the listeners of the "An Argument More" program.    [Jovanovic] Not at all.</p>

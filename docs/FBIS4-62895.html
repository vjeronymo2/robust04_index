			<p>BFN     [Text] Kyrgyzstan wants its relations with Japan to develop  dynamically and along many fronts, President Askar Akayev said  Wednesday [18 May] when he met with the Japanese economic  mission in Kyrgyzstan.    He said that his country would welcome wider activities of  Japanese businessmen and that a Japanese business center would  be set up in the capital Bishkek shortly. Akayev emphasized  that Japan's aid in reconstructing the republic's economy, in  particular in reforming the banking system was invaluable.    Akayev thought that Japan could be involved in structural  changes now underway in Kyrgyzstan. He supported the  Japan-proposed, long-term Silk Route of the 21st Century project  of developing telecommunication and airlines between Eastern  Europe, Russia and South East and Central Asia.    The project would turn Kyrgyzstan into a center of  transportation and communication links between Europe and Asia,  Akayev thought.</p>

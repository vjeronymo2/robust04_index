The FFEL Program consists of the Federal Stafford, Federal Supplemental Loans for Students (SLS), Federal PLUS, and the Federal Consolidation Loan programs. These amendments are needed to implement changes made to the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended (HEA), by the Higher Education Amendments of 1992, and certain technical changes made by the Cash Management Improvement Act Amendments of 1992, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, and the Higher Education Technical Amendments of 1993. The regulations amend the FFEL Program loan discharge provisions and enhance the ability of lenders and guaranty agencies to service and collect FFEL Program loans.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  These regulations take effect either 45 days after publication in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  or later if the Congress takes certain adjournments, with the exception of &sect;&sect;682.202, 682.208, 682.402, 682.410, and 682.411.

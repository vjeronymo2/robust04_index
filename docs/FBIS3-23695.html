			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Oleg Volkov, under the rubric "Details": </F> "Ukrainian Rocket Builders Are Trying To Steal Into Russian  Space"]    [Text] Hardly had Russia sort of smoothed out some of its  space business with Kazakhstan when it "ran into snags" with  another situation -- this time with Ukraine. On 10 January,  after a year-and-a-half silence, the separate tracking complex  in Yevpatoriya, after connecting with the orbital station Mir,  was "showing off" in the cosmic ether. Of course, Ukraine's  attempt--the first in the history of the planet in which one  state controls the space vehicle of another state -- wasn't  without excesses. True enough, the people in orbit didn't notice  that: knowledgeable staffers from the Flight Control Center near  Moscow assure us that the contingency situation that arose when  the Soyuz craft was docking with the station, for which some  mass media have already blamed Ukraine, was caused by other  circumstances. But then, on the ground, many have responded  overly sensitively to the signals from Yevpatoriya.    The fact of the matter is that a year and a half ago, all  three tracking complexes located in Ukrainian territory (in  Simferopol, Yevpatoriya, and Dunayevtsy in Khmelnitskaya Oblast)  were disengaged from the unified Russian loop for controlling  space vehicles. And, as we are told by the press service of the  Military Space Forces of the Russian Federation Ministry of  Defense, that step was absolutely necessary and justified for  the interests of the Russian state. Ukraine, which at the time  was going through the very peak of the self-effusive boom,  nationalized the complexes and flatly refused to resubordinate  the military servicing them to the Russian command. But that is  a necessary condition for the normal functioning of orbital  complexes and vehicles -- hardware, as we know, has nothing to  do with democracy or pluralism.    So in 1992, with one stroke of the pen, three complexes  stuffed with super electronics and other "high-tech" gear were  buried -- in a very literal sense, the not-very-sweet fate of  the scrap yard was prepared for their remains. According to data  from the Russia's Military Space Forces, nearly a third of the  military servicemen were immediately placed on reserve status,  30 percent agreed to give up their warm and cozy southern nests  for the prospect of work and were transferred to Russia, and the  rest declared their oath of allegiance to Ukraine. What they did  until 10 January, no one knows -- since, as our military people  assure us, it is virtually impossible to operate the complexes  "for what they're supposed to do" in unmanned mode.    The only exception was the Yevpatoriya Center for Deep Space  Communications, which was operating as before "in the system."  In theory, substitutes were found in Russia for all three  Ukrainian tracking complexes -- not full-fledged substitutes, of  course, but substitutes that were entirely satisfactory. And  only the Yevpatoriya center, with its 70-meter antenna (a second  complex, and the only one in Russia, with similar capabilities  is located near the Far East's Ussuriysk) couldn't be totally  eliminated from the plans. Yevpatoriya figures in the agreement  on the international space observatory Granat, which was  concluded in 1988, when parties of the Belovezh agreement hadn't  yet become political diehards. Violation of the conditions of  the hard-currency agreement would have threatened Russia with  rather large fines, and so, as happens in such cases, the  question was solved very quickly and, without any problems on  the Ukrainian side, agreed to.    But nobody made any agreements on the control of Russian  space vehicles from within Ukrainian territory!    True, in the space circles people have long been talking as  if Ukraine was ready to return to the unified control loop. In  the Russian Space Agency, they assert that the problem is being  studied -- in fact, nobody wants the unique equipment that, by  the way, was created by the entire country (USSR) to get lost.  And preliminary agreements already exist.    But Russian Space Agency officials refuse for now to answer  the question about who it was "on our side" who sanctioned the  initiative regarding the separate tracking station in  Yevpatoriya. In an interview with IZVESTIYA, the director of the  tracking complex, Col Viktor Dubasov, declared that those under  him are simply voluntarily backing up the work of their Russian  colleagues. At the same time, however, it is obvious that such  decisions are not being made by the officers of the middle ranks.    In any case, all the talks are being conducted behind the  backs of those who are directly involved in the control of  Russian space hardware. For the Military Space Forces that are  responsible for both military orbital equipment and all the  "civilian" equipment, the "revival" of Yevpatoriya was a big,  and not very pleasant, surprise. The commander of the Military  Space Forces, Col Gen Vladimir Ivanov, who is also the chairman  of the Interstate Commission on Manned Missions, came out  against the initiative. The Russian military feel that all the  attempts of Ukraine to return to the "loop" will be feasible  only after the problem of the division of the juridical  responsibility is solved and a bilateral agreement regulating  the activity of the Ukrainian space forces is signed. And until  then, any inclusion of Yevpatoriya is just senseless: the  Ukrainians will not be able to control space vehicles without  knowing the highly classified system of codes, but to create  rather serious hindrances will be simple.</p>

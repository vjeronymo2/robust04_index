			<p><P> October 6, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LIFE ON THE CIRCUIT: RUSHIN' IN, OUT AT RECEPTION FOR SOVIETS  </P> <P> The Scene  </P> <P> Post-concert hob-nob in the Center Club following Tuesday's performance by the  Moscow Virtuosi at the Performing Arts Center. Members of the Soviet chamber  orchestra -- whose classical selections inaugurated the Orange County  Philharmonic Society's 36th season -- mingled with 100 or so OCPS subscribers.  Briefly. Call it school-night syndrome: The well-heeled locals arrived just  before 10 p.m., and all but a few were gone an hour later. After changing from  their tuxes, the Soviets arrived late and stayed later -- until finally (not  even midnight yet!) the only signs of life in that paneled corner of the plush  club were a dozen Russians seated at two candle-lit tables, smoking, drinking,  talking among themselves.  </P> <P> The Buzz:  </P> <P> Lost in the translation. "The concert was incredible, but I didn't understand  what the conductor was saying before the encores," said Margaret Martin, who  attended the performance and party with Melissa Brandl. After a few strained  exchanges with one of the Muscovites, Pat Krone shook her head and went back to  her champagne. "I asked him why they didn't have any women in the group," said  Krone. "I'm a product of the women's movement and that's the first thing I saw  when they came out on stage -- all men. Why don't they have any women  musicians? He said they can't because they travel so much." Krone laughed. "I  wanted to tell him women know how to pack, too." Off in a corner, business  partners Daniel Ibarra and Mario Schelfi discussed the Virtuosi's virtuosity.  "More perfect," said Schelfi. "Exactly," agreed Ibarra. "For me," said Schelfi,  "the American sound is more commercial and (the Moscow Virtuosi) are less, how  do you say this?" Schelfi turned to Ibarra, who translated a few words about  the Soviets from Argentine Spanish into English. "They are the least  re-touched," said Ibarra, taking a bite of cheese.  </P> <P> The Food  </P> <P> Three buffets. The first (tucked in a corner by the grand piano) held cheeses  and fruit -- raspberries and strawberries and grapes spilling down piles of  purple kale. The second (deeper in the dark room) was loaded with chicken and  cheese enchiladas. Third and most dangerous (against the far wall, under oil  paintings of sun on the water or fire and clouds -- who can tell?) offered a  silver tureen of creamy chocolate fondue and hunks of fruit. Servers skimmed  through the crowd bearing trays of champagne and Chardonnay. What, no wodka?  </P> <P> Who Was There  </P> <P> ErichVollmer, executive director of OCPS, who noted the Virtuosi's popularity  here (this was their second visit and the season-opener, no less). "They play  as if there were only three people up there (on stage)," said Vollmer, plucking  a glass of bubbly water from a passing tray. "It's rare to hear such unanimity  of artistic purpose." Conductor and soloist Vladimir Spivakov, who was much in  demand for party talk (and led briskly around the room, from one tony couple to  another). Edra Brophy of Palm Desert, who sat with son William Gillespie and  their guests, Richard and Frances Gadbois III. (This series of concerts is  dedicated to Brophy, who put $1.2 million in a charitable trust with OCPS as  beneficiary.) Fred and Eva Schneider, party chairwoman. Marianne and Gary  Hollander. Elaine and Bill Redfield. Joann and Ed Halvajian, OCPS president.  The Halvajians tete-a-teted with Spivakov about relief efforts in the Soviet  region of Armenia, which was devastated by an earthquake last December. (Ed  Halvajian and Spivakov are both Armenian and had heard through the grapevine  about each other's participation in Armenian relief, Halvajian said.)  </P> <P> Overheard:  </P> <P> "One of them said they were getting on an Aeroflot plane for Moscow tomorrow,  and another one said they were going to Pasadena. What did you hear?" PAMELA  MARIN  </P></p>

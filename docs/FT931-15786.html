			<p>930111 FT  11 JAN 93 / Leading Article: History and George Bush IT WOULD, sadly, be rather appropriate if President Bush's term of office were to end in one more confrontation with Iraq - a decisive victory for the US in purely military terms, yet inconclusive and unsatisfying politically. For the presidency as a whole, in retrospect, has something of that quality: a period in which the US reacted to world events with competence and firmness, yet failed to implement, or even to articulate, a broader political strategy. The conventional wisdom is that Mr Bush was successful in foreign policy, but paid the political price for neglecting the domestic economy. Seen from a distance, however, his economic management rates at least a beta plus, while his foreign policy looks uninspired. His competence and professionalism are not in dispute, and indeed compare favourably with those of his immediate predecessors. Yet it is arguably not with them but with Harry S Truman that he should be compared, because no president since Truman has been presented with quite such dramatic challenges. He did act with admirable steadiness in insisting that Germany could and must be reunited within Nato; and in ensuring that the break-up of the Soviet Union was not accompanied by loss of control over its nuclear weapons. But he never seemed to grasp how much was at stake in the heroic attempt of Russians and other east Europeans, after decades of communist oppression and mismanagement, to adopt market economics and liberal democracy. Shared criticism No doubt any simple transposition of the Marshall Plan model would have been inappropriate. No doubt in the 1990s the US could reasonably expect a much greater share of the economic burden to be borne by its allies. Certainly any criticisms of Mr Bush have to be addressed in equal or greater measure to the leaders of Europe, whose interest in the matter was more obvious and direct. Even so, the transformation of eastern Europe called for a western effort of solidarity on the Marshall Plan scale, not just in financial terms but in imagination and leadership; and the US president was the person best placed to provide such leadership. It cannot honestly be said that he did so. The new circumstances also required a reforging of Atlantic ties, which could no longer be taken for granted in the absence of the Soviet threat. The US secretary of state did call for such a reforging in December 1989. If nothing much has come of it, that is as much the Europeans' fault as Mr Bush's. The latter at least appreciated the importance of an open trading regime with rules accepted by all parties. Yet, without in any way excusing the near-paralysis of the European Community, it must be asked whether he really gave this issue the priority it deserved. Withdrawn slogan He will be remembered as the leader of the coalition that reversed Iraq's annexation of Kuwait, giving a new authority to the UN Security Council, and as the man who proclaimed a 'new world order' in 1990, only to withdraw the slogan a year later. He has been ready to exploit some of the opportunities offered by the absence of a global rival, deploying US military force to impose a minimum of international order in the Middle East and, more recently, a minimum of civil order in Somalia. But these actions have been reactive, and carefully limited in time and scope. They have been accompanied, too, by repeated assertions that the US cannot and will not act as the world's policeman. Yet that, it seems, is a role the US cannot wholly avoid. It needs to be institutionalised and multilateralised. The US should not have to bear the whole burden, but equally it cannot expect always to be in command; nor can it continue to treat the UN as essentially a diplomatic convenience. The windows of opportunity that opened in 1989 have not yet banged shut, but many may be close to doing so. The American people have denied Mr Bush a second term, sensing perhaps that he lacks the stature for such a unique historical moment. They have elected a younger, more glamorous and more articulate president, who is not the first to declare the domestic economy his main priority. He may find, like others before him, that he is ultimately judged by his success or failure in discharging America's international responsibilities.</p>

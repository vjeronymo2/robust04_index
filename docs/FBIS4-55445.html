			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Affairs Minister Andrzej Olechowski </F> by an unidentified correspondent; place and date not  given--recorded]    [Text] [Correspondent] Sir, you have presented guidelines  for Polish foreign policy, and they have been adopted by the  parliament. Why was there such a need just at that moment to  present the prospects of Polish foreign policy?    [Olechowski] This is a traditional annual address, which  just  happened to take place recently. It should really have taken  place a month or a month and a half ago, but the political  calendar in Poland is such that governments usually change in  late fall, so that is why all the annual plans are published  more or less in the middle of the year. We will have to think  whether we should not change the budget calendar, and other  things, just as is the case in other countries in the world  where political calendars are such that, for example, the budget  year begins on 1 April or 1 June.    We have such a custom that annual plans, plans for a  particular year, are announced around the spring season.    [Correspondent] Foreign Minister, what are the basic aims of  our foreign policy, and what do we want to achieve in the very  near future?    [Olechowski] I spoke about this for 45 minutes in the Sejm  this week so I can only briefly say that the aims are all  classic ones. First, we want to live in a more secure world.  In this respect, our foreign policy is undoubtedly a very  essential tool in social actions.    Second, we want to live better and better, in the widest  meaning of this word, so we can develop in an unrestrained  manner when we have the best possible conditions for it.    Third, I think that each of us wants to have free contact  with foreigners, to travel abroad, and to host foreigners here.  These are also the tasks of foreign policy.    [Correspondent] There is a marked orientation of Polish  foreign policy toward the West, but, having said that, we should  not forget about the orientation toward the East.    [Olechowski] Orientation toward the West ensues from the  fact  that we feel connected, as it were, with that family of nations.  It is there that our religion came from, it is there that our  alphabet, civilization, and so on came from. Therefore, we feel  we have ties to that part of the world. On the other hand, as  long as there are West and East, because these directions can be  blurred, the final, long-term, and most important aim would be  that Europe become one whole, unified, and that there be no  clear differences as we have today. We want to, and should,  keep contacts with the East in every situation because you  cannot not have contacts with your neighbors. This would  immediately create a very dangerous situation. These relations  can be closer or more distant ones, depending on how the  neighbors behave, but we have to have some relations.    We always have to offer solutions, proposals that we want to  have good relations with them and be friends. We have  formulated such an offer, and such an offer has been accepted.  There was an exchange of substantive, matter-of-fact letters  between myself and [Russian Foreign] Minister Kozyrev, and now  we have achieved a certain program of cooperation between two  neighbors, two important countries for regional policy.    On the other hand, we disagree with how Europe should be  built. We agree on the view that its final appearance should be  undivided, but we see a way to achieve this differently.    [Correspondent] Poland is full of expectations of the West:  We count heavily on Western help in both the economic and the  political spheres. However, the past teaches us that such  expectations often fail. Don't we have a similar situation now?  Certain moves by Western politicians prove that they do not  always understand our fears and our interests.    [Olechowski] To be polemical, in what way does the past  say that we cannot count on this help?    [Correspondent] The year 1939, for instance.    [Olechowski] Perhaps there is a closer one. To be sure, we  did not get $10,000 each in cash, preferably not into a bank  account but in cash. But we did get, after the change of system  and the undertaking of the difficulties of transformation,  assistance that was significant, assistance in the stabilization  of the zloty--$1 billion is no mean sum. The taxpayers there  decided that this must be (?supported). We have also received  significant assistance if we calculate over these past five  years, and if we add up all the money that has been received  from the group of the 24 most industrialized states, we would  also get several billion. Also pay attention, please, to the  fact that this money, these World Bank, IMF credits, could have  gone elsewhere. After all, everyone in the world needs them,  and there are very many countries that would wish to receive  them. But they were directed to us. So, there was also a  decision to be favorable. Finally, take a look at a matter as  follows: We often say that the Europeam Union is protectionist,  that it does not admit our goods. We are offended at this;  however, without negating the fact that it is not sufficiently  open, our exports there have grown over the past few years in  stunning fashion. If they did not wish to admit these goods,  really, then they would after all not admit them. So, this is  also not so. It cannot be permitted to say that this is a  closed world, that this is a world that does not want to help  us, to allude to 1939--about which I also wish to say that, in  the end, we won that war. So, it was also not the case that no  one came with assistance. We will soon be marking the 50th  anniversary of the Warsaw Rising, and we remember. We  nonetheless have in our living thoughts the people who helped us  here, the states that helped and the people who died helping the  Poles. So, we often simplify. We ought not to do this.    [Correspondent] It is worthwhile, when speaking with you, to  (?return to) Polish matters. Lately, we have had signals that  there is no [word indistinct] in looking at Polish foreign  policy through the basic centers of power.    [Olechowski] I do not perceive this that way beccause,  please  note, if any policy at all in Poland enjoys consensus, it is  precisely foreign policy. I have eloquent proof of this. I  have three times presented reports in the Sejm that required a  vote. Two were adopted unanimously, and one had just a little  opposition. So, please show me another area of policy--that is,  another minister--who has attained such a result. This is not  my character trait, just the fact that we all agree about these  main aims. We, however, speak with different voices, and we  often say various things that resound in different ways. But  this does not mean that there is some sort of chaos here. Where  is the chaos, and where is the lack of coherence and  coordination, particularly in such concrete, day-to-day  activities? We are aware of this. Ministerial politics  flourished and flourish in Poland. Everyone cultivates his own  little patch. That is in part perhaps the charm of our  government. When one considers it a little, the Council of  Ministers is a conference agreeing the views of the different  ministries, and not a (word indistinct) that acts in one  direction. But that is how it is conceived in essence, on  principle, by the legislators. Here we propose to the  government the undertaking of certain activities that will  strengthen the coordinating role of the minister of foreign  affairs.</p>

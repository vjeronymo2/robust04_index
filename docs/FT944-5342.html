			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / FT Christmas Books: The pick of the publishing year - From politics to poetry, history to humour - our writers choose the best books of 1994 East, West (Cape, Pounds 9.99), home in neither, but poised somewhere in between - Salman Rushdie's volume of short stories on this theme is deft, inventive, entertaining. Reading it, I stumbled late also on his Haroun and the Sea of Stories (Granta Pounds 12.99 hbk, Penguin Pounds 4.50 pbk), a fable for children of all ages that will delight generations to come. Iain Bank's Complicity (Abacus, Pounds 6.99) is a cocktail of sex, skulduggery and hi-tech mystery, set most convincingly in a Caledonian newsroom. The Glasgow Herald of my staid youth would never have employed Complicity's fall-guy protagonist, but I shall now read everything Banks has written. From high up the current US best-seller list, a nightmarish trifle: Politically Correct Bedtime Stories (Souvenir Press, Pounds 6.99) modern tales for our life and times. The author James Finn Garner is presumably pulling our leg. It isn't really necessary to go to such lengths to avoid offence across the pond? Is it? Perhaps it is, and may be here also one day. Laugh while you can.</p>

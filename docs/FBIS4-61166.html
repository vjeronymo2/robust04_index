			<p>BFN     [Text] Vilnius, 3 May, BNS -- The Lithuanian Union of  Nationalists on 2 May registered its initiative group and began  collecting signatures under a demand to hold early parliamentary  elections.    In its address to the people of Lithuania, the initiative  group said early elections "is the only way to stop the  pernicious governing of the LDDP (ruling Lithuanian Democratic  Labor Party)" and to bring honest, competent and determined  people to power.    To achieve its goal, the union has to collect 300,000  signatures in two months. The union's representative in  parliament MP Leonas Milcius told reporters Monday [2 May] that  the nationalists hope to collect signatures and to hold a  referendum together with the Conservative Party, which earlier  started collecting signatures for a referendum on unlawful  privatization and compensation of savings.    So far, the union's initiative received support only from  the  Democratic Party. The nationalists and the democrats have six  seats in the parliament.    A representative of the Democratic Party declined to comment  on the passiveness of the conservatives and the Christian  Democrats, but noted that "an observer status is not the best  way out."    The Nationalist Union expects early elections to take place  in February-March next year. The organizers said their are not  worried by the results of public opinion polls, which suggest  continuing popularity of leftist forces. "A greater part of the  nation will come to reason."</p>

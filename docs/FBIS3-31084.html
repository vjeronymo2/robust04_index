In the course of extensive and open talks, the Serbian  president's office reports, views were exchanged regarding the  efforts to put an end to the civil war in the area of  ex-Bosnia-Herzegovina and find a political solution to the  crisis. They stressed that NATO's decision has undoubtedly  inflicted political damage on the negotiating process for  ex-Bosnia-Herzegovina. Agreement was expressed to the effect  that there is no alternative to political negotiations as the  only sensible path that can lead to a stable peace in this area.    In this context it was pointed out that reduced tensions in  the Sarajevo area would represent a significant step toward  securing a political solution, as this would avert the risk of  foreign military intervention and an escalation of warfare with  far-reaching consequences for peace and stability in this part  of Europe.</p>

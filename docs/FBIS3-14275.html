			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] AKHBAR AL-USBU' has learned that U.S. special envoy  Dennis Ross promised the Jordanian Government to consider easing  U.S. pressures on Jordan. These pressures have recently been  intensified with the aim of forcing Jordan to sign a separate  peace treaty with the Israelis. The U.S. envoy, however,  refused to make any promises that these pressures would be  lifted. He said only that his government would study the  Jordanian demands.    The U.S. Administration stepped up its pressures on Jordan  during the U.S. envoy's tour of the region by intercepting ships  and holding them in international waters, sometimes for over a  week, on the pretext of inspecting them or the claim that they  are carrying banned goods bound for Iraq.    Washington asked the Jordanian Government through its envoy  Dennis Ross to end the second and third degree Arab boycott of  Israel and support the Arab states calling for the lifting of  this boycott at the Arab League meetings in Cairo next Saturday.    The U.S. envoy said that the continuation of the U.S. and  European aid to Jordan is conditional on Amman's response to the  following specific U.S. terms and conditions:    1. Expediting negotiations on the Jordanian-Israeli track.    2. Sparing talk about the issue of Jerusalem because this  will be discussed in the final stages of the peace process.    3. Ending the Arab boycott of Israel and dealing with the  U.S. companies that trade with Israel, have branches in Israel,  or are engaged in joint ventures with the Israelis. This will  be a prelude to eventually dealing with the Israeli companies  and to opening Jordanian markets to their products.    4. Canceling the government protectionism of some  domestic products and allowing for free trade.    5. Intensifying the embargo on Iraq and banning the entry  of any mechanical [ali] materials except through the United  Nations.    6. Suspending Jordanian media campaigns against the  Israeli policy and stopping the mobilization of the masses  against Israel.    7. Ending the activities of the Palestinian organizations  opposing the U.S. policy, and pursuing their members.    8. Pursuing the hardline Islamic current that is hostile  to U.S. policy, and supporting the moderate Islamists who do not  engage in politics. According to the U.S. proposal, this will  be a cover for government pursuit of political Islamists.    9. Cooperating with the United States in pursuing  international terrorism.    10. Expediting the implementation of the International  Monetary Fund reforms.    AKHBAR AL-USBU' has also learned that the U.S.  Administration  has asked its friends in the region not to support Jordan on the  political, economic, or media levels as a retribution for its  positions. It is also seeking to isolate Jordan and besiege it  politically and economically in order to force it to yield to  the U.S.-Israeli conditions.    Sources in the U.S. delegation that accompanied Mr. Ross on  his Amman visit voiced resentment over the harsh Jordanian  campaign the Jordanian House of Representatives launched against  the U.S. policy a few hours before the U.S. envoy's arrival.  Responding to this, a responsible Jordanian source said: The  Americans can ask the deputies and parties. The Jordanian  Government does not officially interfere in this. These are  popular demands and Jordan is a democratic country.    In a related development, an Arab official in Washington  confirmed to AKHBAR AL-USBU' that in the wake of Security  Council Resolution 904, which condemned the al-Ibrahimi Mosque  massacre, Jordan began to face tremendous U.S. pressure to  expedite the peace process with Israel. He added: These  pressures are represented in the U.S. retraction of a commitment  to lift the siege on the port of al-'Aqabah and in growing media  campaigns against the pan-Arab Jordanian position so that Jordan  will continue to be isolated on the Arab level, in addition to  threats to withhold U.S. and European financial aid. The impact  of the U.S. pressure and threats on the Jordanian track of the  peace process will be weak and will not serve the cause of  peace, nor will any economic or political embargo that leads to  Jordan's isolation serve the cause of peace.    Continuing, he said: The onslaught on Jordan has been  exposed to the Jordanian people, who are suffering from the  siege on al-'Aqabah. Moreover, there is interference to prevent  pan-Arab cooperation and coordination with Syria to get out of  the Israeli bottleneck, which the United States is strongly  seeking to impose on the peace tracks, especially the Jordanian  track, and expedite a solution in accordance with the Israeli  concept.</p>

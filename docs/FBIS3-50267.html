			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak visited the  Polish Press Agency [PAP] this morning. During a brief meeting  of the agency management he spoke about the need for  journalistic integrity.    [Begin Pawlak recording] I hope that PAP will deal with  facts  and information related to facts and not with spreading feelers  put out by other media. This, I think, is a general issue that  concerns mass media in general, to concentrate on facts -- and  on important facts -- and not make a huge story out of minor  matters. It often happens that once a story is verified it is  hard to tell where it originated, but by that time it is all  over the place.    So, I think that such an agency as PAP should serve as an  example of reliability and publish information that is important  to the public, the state, and the economy. [end recording]    Asked what feelers he had in mind, Prime Minister Pawlak  recalled the issue of the Concordat.    [Begin Pawlak recording] There was a situation when a well  known local radio set in motion an avalanche of suppositions,  speculations, and considerations around alleged expert reports.  Later, when there was a joint statement by the government and  episcopate press offices, it seemed like the reports could  hardly get through.    I understand that sensations should find their way to the  consumers, but journalistic integrity requires equal treatment  of information concerning facts and correction of information if  it is untrue. But it would be best not to deal with untrue  information at all. [end recording]</p>

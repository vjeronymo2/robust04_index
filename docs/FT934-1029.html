			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / Survey of Sweden (10): The prospects for economic recovery - Interview: Professor Assar Lindbeck Professor Assar Lindbeck is the head of the committee which chooses Nobel Prize winners in economics. Earlier this year he headed the Lindbeck Commission, which provided the government with the most detailed critique of the country's economic and political problems for a generation. Proposing no fewer than 113 reforms of the current system, the report mapped out a path to economic recovery. Professor Lindbeck discussed the prospects for that recovery with Christopher Brown-Humes: Question: What is the short-term outlook for the economy? Answer: I think we have bottomed out in all respects. Production and manufacturing went down by 17 per cent from the top in 1989 to the bottom in December 1992, but from January this year it has increased by about 8 per cent. That reflects the dual economy. We have very high growth in the manufacturing sector and exports but still falling domestic aggregate demand. What is still going down is building activity because that was blown up to such a bubble during the 1980s. And municipalities are financially squeezed and will continue to shed labour. The crucial thing is what happens to private consumption because that is 55 per cent of GNP. The savings rate in the housing sector was minus 5 per cent at the end of the 1980s; now it's plus 11 per cent. If this doesn't change then the economy will continue to go down. Will devaluation's gains be eroded as rapidly as they were in the 1980s? There are some dramatic differences. In the 1980s unemployment never went above 3.5 per cent; now it's 8 per cent, and 15 per cent if you include those on training schemes. The other difference is that in the 80s you had so many unique expansionary activities such as the building boom and the deregulation of the capital markets. In the 80s you spoilt devaluation's gains in five years between 1982 and 1987. They will probably last more than five years this time. What about the long-term development of Swedish competitiveness? The social security system is being cut down to size. We suggested in the report that benefit levels should not be higher than 70 or 80 per cent of previous income. Now it is down to 80 per cent and there is a waiting period before you get sick compensation. That has brought lower absenteeism. In the late 1980s people were away from work with claimed sickness for 25 days a year on average and if you include absenteeism for other reasons, like sick relatives, it was 50 days. Taxation of small firms is also being changed. Small firms play a much smaller role in Sweden than in other European countries and when you look at the tax system and regulation, you realise what an extraordinarily hostile environment they have had for 25 years. That has changed dramatically. To what extent has the public understood the change that has taken place? People have been shocked by what has happened. They have found out that Sweden was an ordinary country: we were not a planet outside the solar system in its own orbit governed by laws legislated by labour unions and labour market board. The question is, do people believe it's just a temporary shock and you can return to the old ways later on? I think many people do. The dilemma is that 55-60 per cent of the electorate get at least 80 per cent of their income from the public sector. How do you reform the public sector when the majority of the electorate live on tax money? Today we have 137 tax-financed people for every 100 market-financed people. Holland is worried because they have 70 tax-financed for every 100 market-financed. This explains the extraordinary tax burden and public spending being 70 per cent of GNP. It also explains why you get such enormous protests every time you try to cut something because you have created these vested interests in public spending. My advice to any country that is spending 40-50 of GNP in the public sector is don't increase it because it's hopeless to get it down again. It needs politicians with a suicidal instinct to take public spending down from 70 to 50 per cent of GNP. Anne Wibble (the Swedish finance minister) has such suicidal instincts so from that point of view she's useful. Is Sweden going to have to get used to unemployment at the levels we are seeing now? No, but we are not going to go down to the 1.5 per cent level we saw in 1989. Maybe we can get down to an open unemployment level of 3-4 per cent, with a further 2 per cent on training schemes. But certain things have to be done. Firstly, job security legislation has to be changed so that small firms dare to hire. They don't dare to hire in a world of uncertainty because it's too expensive to fire people. Secondly, future jobs have to be created in the private services sector, which means reducing tax wedges. The third factor is wages for low-skilled workers. In Sweden an 18-year-old industrial worker has a salary which is 85 per cent of what a 34-year-old earns, despite lacking skills, training and experience. It was only 55 per cent 20 years ago. It has to go down to 55 per cent again, but it will be a very painful process because it's against the ideology of the labour unions. Is there scope for further cuts in interest rates? Yes, for two reasons. One is that recession is so deep on the continent that we have to expect cuts in interest rates there. Secondly, I think there is some improvement in the budget deficit. The debt office reports a profound improvement in the cash position of the government in the last three or four months. That's important because many financial institutions were forecasting a further deterioration of the budget deficit. I would think lower rates were more likely than unchanged rates. What is the outlook for the krona? The exchange rate is undervalued in terms of competitiveness. But there are still expectations of a further fall in the krona. How can that be? Because people are not confident that Swedish politicians can control the deficit or that the decisions so far have been credible enough. You have to be tough in the sense that you make a credible commitment to solve the budget crisis over a five-year period. On the other hand, you have to choose timing so that you don't drive the economy down further. How much inflationary pressure is there in the economy? The risk for a new round of wage increases is modest when you have unemployment of 8-15 per cent. Inflation went up from 2 to 5 per cent after the devaluation, but now it's on the 2 per cent path again. But what happens in the next upswing? Will wage earners try to get revenge? That's a risk, particularly if people drop out from the labour force and cause bottlenecks for skilled workers. You can get inflation problems even if unemployment is 6 per cent if the skill and regional mix is bad and you move too fast.</p>

			<p><P> December 29, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> L.F. ROTHSCHILD REACHES ACCORD WITH CREDITORS  </P> <P> L. F. Rothschild Holdings Inc., parent of a respected Wall Street brokerage  crushed in the 1987 stock market crash, said Thursday that it had reached  agreement with creditors on a bankruptcy court reorganization plan.  </P> <P> The plan, which needs approval by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court, restructures $101  million in debt on which the parent of L. F. Rothschild &amp; Co. defaulted in  June.  </P> <P> Rothschild Holdings issued a statement saying its committee of unsecured  creditors had approved the restructuring proposal. The brokerage subsidiary was  not included in the bankruptcy court filing.  </P> <P> Since its parent sought protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of federal  bankruptcy law in June, Rothschild &amp; Co. has shuffled its management and  scaled down its businesses in an effort to stay alive as a smaller brokerage.  </P> <P> "We've gone about trying to intelligently refocus the broker-dealer, which was  never part of the bankruptcy," Rothschild Chief Executive Joel E. Miller said  in an interview. "We're small and lean and well capitalized for what we do."  </P> <P> Founded in 1899, the brokerage now has 45 workers.  </P></p>

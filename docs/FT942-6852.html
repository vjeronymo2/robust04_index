			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading Derivative dealers reported a volatile session in stock index futures which saw the June contract recover from the previous day's slide to close above 3,000, writes Joel Kibazo. The opening of the June contract on the FT-SE 100 at 3,022 was better than anticipated by dealers. However, strong selling, attributed to Goldman Sachs was said to have been the cause of the early retreat in the contract. Thereafter, June followed the erratic mood in the bond markets, though occasionally went its own way on dealing by independent traders. At the day's low, June fell to 2,990 before bouncing to return above the 3,000 level, a move repeated several times. The contract led the cash market for most of the day. The firm opening on Wall Street helped steady June and it closed at 3,008, up 9 on its previous close but at a 13 point discount to cash. Volume was again good, reaching 15,702 contracts by the close. In the June Mid 250 on the FT-SE, 165 lots were dealt as the contract closed at 3,597. In traded options, Volume fell back from Wednesday's high levels and closed at 31,160 contracts. Of that total, 18378 was traded in the FT-SE 100 option and 1,925 in the Euro FT-SE. Prudential Corporation was the most active stock option with a total of 1,064 contracts.</p>

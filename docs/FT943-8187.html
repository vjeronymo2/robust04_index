			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / International Company News: Reduced personnel costs help ABB to 31% surge ABB Asea Brown Boveri, the world's largest power engineering group, has reported a 31 per cent surge in net income in the first half, to Dollars 322m. It attributed the improvement to lower personnel costs. A 3 per cent rise in the Zurich-based group's order intake, to Dollars 15.5bn, indicated that recovery was under way in many important markets. 'Germany and the other heavy countries are starting to move now,' Mr Percy Barnevik, chief executive, said. Profits before taxes and extraordinary items jumped 20 per cent to Dollars 608m. Mr Barnevik indicated that earnings growth for the full year would closely follow that trend. He said the full impact of the upturn in investment goods 'will not be felt until next year'. Revenues in the first half were flat at Dollars 13.1bn, dragged down by a 10.5 per cent slide in income from European Union countries, to Dollars 4.44bn. Revenues from other western European countries, mainly the group's manufacturing centres of Switzerland and Sweden, were up 1.5 per cent to Dollars 2.57bn. Revenues from Asia, Australasia and Africa, meanwhile, jumped 12.3 per cent to Dollars 3.2bn. Revenues from the Americas rose 2.4 per cent to Dollars 2.6bn. Operating income climbed 19 per cent to Dollars 1.12bn, mainly because personnel expenses dropped Dollars 147m to Dollars 4.37bn. All divisions, except financial services, had improved earnings. Mr Barnevik said the group continued to shed labour at a brisk pace, with 4,000 jobs lost in various operations in the first half. On the other hand, 2,500 people were taken on and 6,000 were absorbed with acquisitions. The trend, he said, was to reduce employment in high labour cost areas, and increase it in eastern Europe and Asia. However, there was no plan for further large-scale rationalisation in western Europe. The group's order backlog stood at Dollars 32.3bn at the end of June, 9 per cent higher than a year earlier. Mr Barnevik said the order intake in the first half was up 6 per cent in local currencies. He stressed that that figure represented real volume growth, as price increases were rare. Lex, Page 14</p>

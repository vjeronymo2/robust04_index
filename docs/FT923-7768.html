			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Mortgage rates pressure eases - But the future for home loans looks uncertain MILLIONS OF property owners in the UK sighed with relief this week on learning that the large building societies have not followed Skipton, the 14th biggest society, by putting up their home loan rates. Skipton raised its mortgage interest rate from the industry standard of 10.75 per cent to 11.25 per cent on Tuesday, triggering fears of a more widespread increase. Skipton has only 60,000 borrowers compared with Halifax's 1.8m, and the increase still leaves its rate slightly below most of the centralised lenders. Some small societies have, unnoticed, been charging this rate for several months. Nor is the extra which Skipton customers have to pay particularly onerous - Pounds 165 a year on a Pounds 40,000 mortgage after tax relief, according to John Goodfellow, Skipton's chief executive. However, Goodfellow expects other societies to put their rates up before very much longer. 'I simply do not believe it will be possible for them to sustain the present standard mortgage rate until the end of the year.' Goodfellow, and others in the mortgage industry, believe that there may well be a political upset before very long - possibly triggered by an event such as a French 'no' vote in the referendum on the Maastricht Treaty - which will lead to a devaluation and a fall in interest rates. The alarm seems to have reflected two underlying anxieties. One is that even a slight increase in mortgage rates would ruin any lingering chance of an early recovery in the property market, since it would come at precisely the time that stamp duty has been reimposed by the government on house purchases. The other problem is a gut fear among the public of a return to higher interest rates. With inflation running at the lowest level in many years, the second danger is not immediate. Most economists argue that real interest rates are much too high and ought to fall rapidly. If that is the case, it may not be sensible to go for the fixed rate mortgage products which looked so attractive a year ago. Anyone now entering the housing market is less likely to need a cap against rates going back up to very high levels, than the ability to take advantage of a fall in rates. That said, there are still plenty of fixed rates on the market. Long term fixed rates at below 10 per cent seem to be less abundant than many might wish, and the present crop of fixed rates will not look like a good idea if the day comes when the base rate falls to 6 or 7 per cent. Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester has withdrawn its two year fixed rate at 9.6 per cent and replaced it with a four year fix at 10.75 per cent. It is available for up to 80 per cent of valuation and is fully portable. The application fee is Pounds 250 and the early redemption penalties amount to Pounds 250; repayment and interest-only mortgages welcome. Capital Home Loans is offering mortgages fixed at 10.25 per cent for either three years or five years. There is a Pounds 295 completion fee and compulsory building insurance. One attraction of this mortgage for the self-employed is that Capital Home Loans is temporarily accepting self-certification of income. John Charcol, the leading specialist mortgage broker, has set up a reducing mortgage on which interest drops from 9.99 per cent (APR 11.6 per cent) to 8.99 per cent over the first six years of the loan. There is a fairly stiff Pounds 395 application fee. Customers who do not take Charcol's buildings and contents insurance pay an extra 0.25 per cent on their mortgage interest rate. There is a six months interest penalty for early redemption. However, the week's most interesting mortgage deal comes from the Mortgage Corporation, the centralised lender which has been taking a low profile in the market for most of this year. It is offering new customers Pounds 200 towards the cost of their legal fees; Pounds 200 towards valuation fees; free insurance against being gazumped; and a free deposit guarantee voucher worth Pounds 100. There is also a contribution of Pounds 300 to the costs of remortgaging. That said, the TMC mortgage rates are not so different from the rest of the market: 10.4 per cent (APR 11.3 per cent) for four years. TMC has also set an example to other centralised lenders by lowering its standard variable rate to 10.99 per cent, bringing its APR of 11.5 per cent for existing customers in line with most building society rates. Most surprising, it is offering a small discount as a bonus to existing customers who have a standard TMC mortgage and who have not missed a payment in three years. Such a bonus would have been unthinkable a few years ago.</p>

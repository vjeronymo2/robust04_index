			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Arms Export Permitted at a Lower </F> Level?"]    [Text] The export of defense materiel will always need an  export license even in the future, but it can be granted by the  Ministry of Defense instead of by the government, which is now  the primary licensing authority. This is the opinion of a  working group at the Ministry of Defense that has studied the  need for reforming the arms export legislation, particularly in  view of the European Union. The group submitted its memorandum  to Defense Minister Elisabeth Rehn on Wednesday [20 April].    If required for reasons of foreign or security policy, the  license could also in the future be issued by the government,  says the working group. The working group included  representatives of the Ministries of Defense, Foreign Affairs,  Trade and Industry, as well as the Interior Ministry and the  General Staff.</p>

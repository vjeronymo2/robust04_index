			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / Arts: Birthday - The Place It is difficult to understand just what the Cholmondeleys (Lea Anderson's all-girl troupe) and the Featherstonehaughs (their male companions) seek to do as dance and theatre. Maybe the clue lies in a belief that the jokey titles of the ensembles are sufficient guarantee of style, and that supposedly humorous mime, thinly armatured with dance, is justification for professional existence. What I have seen with these two ensembles in the past amounts to strip-cartoon theatre of the flimsiest kind, and Lea Anderson's new Birthday, unveiled this week as part of the Spring Loaded season at The Place, is as anaemic theatrically as it is uncertain in dance terms. The six dancers of each troupe are involved in what I take to be satiric comments upon the idea of celebration - from putting on one's glad-rags to not being wildly happy with the presents that one is given. The cast nip in and out of various outfits, groom each other (a not wildly appealing sight), and spend far too much time playing with silver balloons. The creative process amounts to scenes of laboured dramatics interspersed with dance of minimal interest and curiously repetitive form. 'If three people do it, it must be choreography' seems Miss Anderson's motto, and we see again those massed stamping and wheelings, those fraught trudgings, that I associate with her earlier work. The dancers potter about with a dead-pan air, and fulfil tiny tasks, whose most vivacious moment comes when three couples wrestle in their dressing-gowns. Nowhere did I detect choreography as a valid means of exploring situation or character, nor a concern for dance as an art self-sufficient and powerful. Miss Anderson's sense of movement and her theatrical vocabulary provide an evening ineffably heavy-handed, with gesture as a emphatic decoration to dull steps. An accompanying score by Steve Blake was played by a jazz trio - The Victims of Death - and sounded muddy and rebarbative. It reflected exactly the quality of the evening. Birthday is the fruit of a Barclays New Stages Award.</p>

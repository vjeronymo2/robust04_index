			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / Japan's Political Crisis: Japanese see hopeful signs in economy THE DOWNTURN in the Japanese economy may have bottomed out in the first quarter of this year after a prolonged period of weakness, according to government figures released yesterday. Real gross national product in the first three months of the year grew at an annual rate of 2.3 per cent, supported by a strong rise in domestic demand, the Economic Planning Agency said. Gross domestic product in the first quarter grew at an annual rate of 2.7 per cent. On a quarterly basis GNP rose 0.6 per cent from the previous quarter, while GDP was up 0.7 per cent. Meanwhile, broad money supply for May rose a strong 1.5 per cent year-on-year. This was the strongest growth in money supply since the first quarter of last year and comes after a long period of weak or negative money supply growth. Money supply growth has been negative in the months since September last year, excluding February and April of this year when money supply rose 0.1 per cent and 0.5 per cent respectively. Mr Shunji Fukinbara, deputy director-general of the Economic Planning Agency, welcomed the rise in the GDP figures, which he said supported the agency's report earlier this month that the economy had hit bottom. The strong rise in the money supply, however, reflected the government's efforts to stimulate the economy rather than a significant pick-up in domestic economic activity. A Bank of Japan official noted that the increase in the money supply in May was largely due to fiscal factors, such as the fall in tax payments to the government. The rise in GNP was supported by a strong 6.5 per cent increase in public spending, although private consumption also rose 1.2 per cent over the previous quarter, largely as a result of increased spending on cars and other durable goods. However, weak demand for vehicles in April and May, when sales fell 10 per cent, suggest that the rise in private consumption may not be sustained. Private residential investment also continued to be weak, marking a decline of 3.0 per cent. Real exports showed a slight decline. Fiscal 1992 as a whole showed the lowest growth rate in 18 years - since the Japanese economy contracted 0.2 per cent in fiscal 1974, just after the first oil crisis. GNP was up only 0.8 per cent, compared with the government's target of 1.6 per cent. The annual GNP growth rate for fiscal 1992 compares with a growth rate of 3.3 per cent in 1991 and 5.3 per cent in 1990. The Bank of Japan has revised downward the year-on-year increase in the money supply for April from 0.6 per cent to 0.5 per cent.</p>

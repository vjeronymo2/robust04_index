			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / Minister resigns amid new claims of Tory 'sleaze': Smith admits breaking disclosure rules - Hamilton denies allegations Mr John Major's government was shaken yesterday by fresh allegations of financial impropriety after the forced resignation of a government minister over his past business relationship with Mr Mohamed Fayed, owner of Harrods. A second minister issued a fierce denial of newspaper allegations - repeated in the House of Commons - that he had received cash for asking parliamentary questions on behalf of Mr Fayed. His political position remained in doubt. Amid chaotic scenes at Westminster, Mr Major stunned the Commons by appearing to suggest under parliamentary privilege that the Harrods chief sought some form of arrangement with the government. A spokesman for Mr Fayed denied that he wanted a deal of any sort with the government. In the latest of a series of personal and financial scandals that have engulfed the government since the 1992 election, Mr Tim Smith, a junior Northern Ireland minister, resigned after admitting he broke parliamentary rules over disclosure of his business links with Harrods. But Mr Neil Hamilton, who as corporate affairs minister is responsible for business ethics, flatly denied any wrongdoing when he supported Mr Fayed during the 1980s battle for control of Harrods with Mr Tiny Rowland of Lonhro. Mr Hamilton said he was suing The Guardian for libel for printing allegations, repeated in the Commons, that he had been paid for his assistance. But several senior Tories continued to voice doubts over whether Mr Hamilton should retain his post. They suggested that he should resign to save the government political embarrassment. Mr Ian Greer, chairman of the consultancy Ian Greer Associates, which acted for Mr Fayed during the same period, also issued writs against The Guardian. Mr Major, who said the allegations against the two ministers had been brought to his attention three weeks ago, startled MPs by saying he had made clear then that he would not come to any 'arrangement' with Mr Fayed. The prime minister said the allegations had originated from, but had not been passed directly by, Mr Fayed, and he had immediately asked Sir Robin Butler, cabinet secretary, to investigate. In what MPs took as indicating that the Harrod's chief had wanted some form of deal, Mr Major added: 'I made it absolutely clear at that time that I was not prepared to come to any arrangement with Mr Fayed.' Downing Street officials, however, later sought to play down that implication, suggesting Mr Major was attempting to demonstrate his determination to act firmly and openly. Mr Smith admitted he received funds for asking questions on behalf of Mr Fayed during the long-running legal battle with Mr Tiny Rowland's Lonhro. In his resignation letter, he said he had not declared all the necessary information in the register of MPs' financial interests. Ironically, Mr Smith first entered the government only nine months ago after the enforced resignation of another junior minister, Mr Tim Yeo, over his personal life. Amid a renewed Labour onslaught against government 'sleaze', Mr Major made clear that he had no hesitation in allowing Mr Smith to resign. In a letter to the former minister, he said his actions while a backbench MP had been 'clearly wrong'. To reinforce the point, Mr Major told the Commons: 'I am determined to ensure high standards of probity right across government and I will not tolerate anything less than the highest standards of behaviour.' Referring to Mr Hamilton, the prime minister said the industry minister  - who along with Mr Smith had been interviewed by Sir Robin and Mr Richard Ryder, the chief whip - had denied all the allegations. Mr Major said Mr Hamilton, also a backbench MP at the time of the alleged payments, 'has written to me refuting the allegations that he was paid any money either to ask questions or undertake any activity whatsoever'. Downing Street subsequently said that a stay by Mr Hamilton at the Ritz, a Paris hotel owned by Mr Fayed, had been looked at by the Commons committee on members' interests. Tory party managers had been told by the committee chairman it was taking no action. But senior Whitehall officials acknowledged the committee had not produced a formal report. During his investigation Sir Robin had instead been shown copies of correspondence between Mr Hamilton and Sir Geoffrey Johnson-Smith, committee chairman. The prime minister faced calls from Mr Tony Blair, Labour leader, for a tightening of rules governing ministerial behaviour. Mr Major said the Commons privileges committee could extend its investigation into two backbench MPs alleged to have accepted cash for parliamentary questions. He rejected Mr Blair's demand that the inquiry be public.

			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Sugar market lacks volatility OVER THE last nine months the sugar market has experienced the lowest monthly average price volatility since 1974, according to the latest sugar report from ED &amp; F. Man, the London trade house. The nearby New York raw sugar futures contract has been stuck in a range between 8 and 10 cents a lb. Man suggests that three seasons of production surpluses have reduced speculative interest in the sugar market, while the rapid demise of central buying agencies has eliminated significant participation by final buyers on the terminal markets. 'The disparate nature of the emerging buyers in East and Central Europe is leaving the speculators uninformed and the trade, in many instances, reacting in a piecemeal fashion as cargoes are sold and funds are organised,' says the report. Man has reduced its estimate for the 1992-93 production surplus from 3.4m tonnes to 1.5m tonnes, with production at 114.91m tonnes compared with an earlier forecast of 116.95m tonnes and consumption at 113.45m tonnes - only just below the earlier prediction. FO Licht, the German statistician, recently cut its 1992-93 production forecast from 116.19m tonnes to 113.94m tonnes. Demand for vegetable oils will remain buoyant, but prices are unlikely to benefit for the next two years, according to a report from the Economist Intelligence Unit. Although stocks will decline, lower stock to consumption ratios will be tolerated because of more efficient management. The EIU expects is basket of vegetable oil prices (half soyabean, half palm oil) to reach Dollars 721 a tonne in 1996-97, up from Dollars 410 a tonne in 1991-92 and Dollars 391 in 1992-93. The outlook is more bullish for oilmeals, which will follow a similar pattern, dipping from Dollars 209 to Dollars 197 a tonne in 1992-93 before rising to Dollars 265 a tonne in 1996-97. Oils and Oilseeds to 1996. Special Report No M703. Pounds 175 from 40 Duke Street, London W1A 1DW.</p>

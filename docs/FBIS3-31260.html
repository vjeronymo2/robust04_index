This decision is correct.  Furthermore, I believe that the Alliance secretly assumed that  the Serbs would take a positive stand on the withdrawal of their  heavy military equipment," Czech Defense Minister Antonin Baudys  said yesterday while visiting Dobruska. Replying to a question  from the LIDOVE NOVINY reporter as to whether an emergency plan  for our soldiers serving with UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] in  former Yugoslavia had been drawn up, Antonin Baudys said: "Our  troops are outside Bosnia-Herzegovina, in the area of the  so-called Serbian Krajina. Should a conflict come about, the  Czech side would proceed in the same way as the troops of other  countries under UN command."</p>

			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / Confident Milosevic insists that Serbians won the war SERBIA'S president, Mr Slobodan Milosevic, yesterday demonstrated his determination to remain in power by vowing to rule over a rump Yugoslavia comprising Serbia and Montenegro. In his first parliamentary address since last July, Mr Milosevic brushed aside growing political opposition to the way in which the war in Croatia was conducted and public discontent over the economy. Instead, he insisted that Serbia had won the war because it had secured the deployment of United Nations peacekeepers who would protect Serbs in Croatia. In a confident and defiant speech which never addressed how Serbia failed to keep the Yugoslav federation together, Mr Milosevic dismissed charges from the leaders of Krajina, a Serb enclave in Croatia, of betraying the interests of the 2.5mn Serbs outside of Serbia. 'The arrival of UN troops means the beginning of the peaceful resolution of the conflict - and an end to the violence against the Serbian people in Krajina,' he said. Mr Milosevic's claim that the fate of the 300,000 Serbs in Krajina may be 'settled' appeared to imply that he believes the despatch of UN forces there means the enclave will no longer be part of Croatia. Croat leaders have declared their intention of regaining all territory occupied by the federal army. In what amounts to a warning to the international community, Mr Milosevic said that 'internal and foreign pressures to make Serbia a powerless Balkan state unable even to take care of itself will not succeed.' But in what appears to indicate some sensitivity about western criticism of Serbia's dismal record on human rights for the 1.9m ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, Mr Milosevic said: 'Problems there will be solved according to international standards.'</p>

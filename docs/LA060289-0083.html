			<p><P> June 2, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KVEA SHAKEUP FUELS DEBATE AT LATINO STATIONS  </P> <P> For months, KVEA Channel 52 staffers have privately grumbled about the  "miserable" representation of Mexicans or Mexican-Americans in key  decision-making positions at Los Angeles' No. 2 Spanish-language TV station and  its New York-based parent network.  </P> <P> But it took the departure of three ranking Latino staffers from KVEA's news  department on Tuesday to make the debate public and give KVEA the distinction  of becoming the second local Spanish-language station to come under fire in  recent weeks for its staffing policies regarding Mexicans and  Mexican-Americans.  </P> <P> Last month, 80 of 150 employees at KMEX Channel 34 -- KVEA's chief rival --  signed an obliquely worded petition that was widely interpreted by staffers and  Latino community leaders as a warning that viewers of Mexican descent are  losing senior management positions within the station and its parent network,  Univision.  </P> <P> "KVEA's viewership is 90% Mexican and Mexican-American, but this station gives  nothing back to the community at the leadership level," said Bob Navarro, a  veteran reporter and news writer who for the past 10 months had been news  director at KVEA. Until his firing Tuesday, he said, he had been the last  Mexican-American in senior station management after the resignation in February  of Frank Cruz, former vice president and general manager.  </P> <P> As KMEX and Univision did with the allegations against them, management at KVEA  and the parent Telemundo network denied Navarro's charges, citing the station's  steady ratings gains as the best evidence of its popularity.  </P> <P> "We produce a service that responds to and serves the community," said Stephen  J. Levin, who replaced Cruz as vice president and general manager. "The  community is overwhelmingly Mexican and Mexican-American. We would not be  serving that community if we did not similarly (represent it) in our news and  entertainment."  </P> <P> Levin said KVEA still features several Mexican and Mexican-American reporters,  including Alberto Aguilar, who anchors the station's half-hour local newscast  at 6 p.m.  </P> <P> Levin declined to characterize the nature of Navarro's departure. The other two  employees, Ray Diaz, managing editor, and Mabel Solares, an assignment editor,  resigned, a station spokesman said.  </P> <P> Levin criticized Navarro for over-emphasizing local news while failing to  report several major breaking international news stories, such as the  pro-democracy protests in China and recent changes in Mexican law allowing  American citizens to own land in Mexico.  </P> <P> Other news staffers privately said another factor contributing to Navarro's  ouster was a recent decline in KVEA's ratings for its 6 p.m. newscast.  According to Arbitron Ratings Co., "Vea Noticias" went from a 1.9 rating, or a  record 44% of the Latino audience, during the February sweeps to a 1.2 rating,  or 33% audience share, during the May sweeps.  </P> <P> Navarro challenged both these claims, arguing that Levin had gone to great  lengths to tell his staff that he agreed with Navarro's local news emphasis.  Despite his preferances, Navarro said he led many newscasts with breaking  international news, including recent political developments Panama and Mexico  City.  </P> <P> The newsman, who previously worked at KNBC Channel 4 and KCBS Channel 2, added  that the recent drop in "Vea Noticias' " ratings were due to the normal spring  viewing drop-off, weaker lead-in shows and the new competition in April from  KWHY Channel 22, the third Spanish-language station to broadcast in the Los  Angeles market.  </P> <P> The allegations of declining Mexican or Mexican-American representation in  senior management have caught the attention of Latino community leaders.  </P> <P> "It (Navarro's departure) is beyond disappointment," Antonia Hernandez,  president of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, a  national Latino civil rights organization, said Thursday.  </P> <P> "It's an affront to our community that they feel they can bring people in who  do not reflect the community. It sends a signal of total disregard."  </P> <P> "Personnel issues aside, we are obviously concerned with this trend," said  Armando Duron, president of the Los Angeles-based National Hispanic Media  Coalition. "It is really ominous. We have been so involved in (pushing for  higher Latino employment) in English-language TV that we've held off on  Spanish-language TV. But it may well be time for us to look into the issue  seriously."  </P> <P> Like its rival, Univision -- which is principally owned by Hallmark Cards Inc.  -- none of Telemundo's board of directors is Latino, a network official in New  York said.  </P> <P> Other network officials acknowledged that two of Telemundo's top eight managers  are Latino -- neither of whom is Mexican or Mexican-American. At Univision,  upper level management is all Latino, though only one of these executives is  Mexican-American.  </P> <P> Latino numbers at Telemundo improve when it comes to the general managers of  the six TV stations it owns. Two of them are Cuban or Cuban-American and two  are Mexican-American, network officials said.  </P> <P> KVEA's Levin insisted that Telemundo's commitment to its Latino viewers must be  viewed as a long-term investment.  </P> <P> "Telemundo's truest goal is to create an environment in which Hispanics are  trained for more management positions," he said.  </P> <P> At the same, Levin added, he cannot allow questions of national origin to  dominate his thinking when it comes to staffing decisions.  </P> <P> "The last thing you think about is where the person comes from," he said. "The  important point is, are they experienced professionals who can put together a  newscast that meets the station's philosophy?"  </P> <P> Levin said that Roberto Soto, a Cuban-American who replaced Navarro, and  Alfredo Fernandez, a Spaniard who replaces Diaz as executive producer, meet  this standard.  </P> <P> "If you do it any other way," he added, "it's reverse racism."  </P></p>

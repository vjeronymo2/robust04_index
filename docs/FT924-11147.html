			<p>921027 FT  27 OCT 92 / Survey of Sri Lanka (14): Networks need to be expanded - Infrastructure IF Sri Lanka is to maintain the impressive levels of growth achieved over the past few years, it will have to expand its communications and power networks. As things stand, roads, telecommunications and power supply are, at best, adequate. They will rapidly become overburdened if the economy continues to grow at current rates. The government, says Mr Akiel Mohamed, power and energy secretary, is well aware of the need to develop the nation's infrastructure. It is, for example, keen to expand electricity supply and diversify from hydro-power, which can be erratic. Of Sri Lanka's 1,250MW installed capacity, about 1,000MW is hydro-power. Severe drought earlier this year drastically cut supplies, forcing the government to impose a 25 per cent surcharge on electricity. Some manufacturers were forced to cut production. 'Hydro-power cannot meet the demands of foreign industry, so it is exactly with that in mind that we are pushing for the expansion of thermal generation,' says Mr Mohamed. Central to Colombo's plans is a proposed 300MW coal-powered station in Trincomalee, a deep-water port in the strife-torn eastern province. A feasibility study was prepared in the 1980s and five consortia have recently been shortlisted. The government hopes the power station will be operational by 1996. The consortium, due to be chosen at the start of 1993, will be expected to build the Dollars 450m power station on a build-operate-transfer (BOT) or a build-own-operate (BOO) basis. It would sell electricity to the national grid - for a fixed period under the BOT arrangement and indefinitely under BOO. 'We hope in future to have all our thermal generation funded by the private sector,' says Mr Mohamed. He admits it might be more difficult to persuade private companies to fund hydro-power which requires huge initial investment. Mr Mohamed says he is not concerned about terrorist attacks on the planned power station in Trincomalee, a city often targeted by the Tigers. But he concedes that terrorists could attack the supply line which will feed electricity from the station into the national grid. This presents a serious disincentive to foreign companies to invest, but donors are believed to have expressed willingness to fund an insurance policy that would cover sabotage. The government's decision to build infrastructure in the east is part of its 'hearts and minds' policy to win support through economic development. Plans are also being considered to build a second international airport in the region, at Hingurakgoda. The overall aim in the power sector is to build up installed capacity to 2,200MW by the year 2000, a level that would easily meet the expected annual 7 per cent growth in demand. Contingency plans could accommodate increased electricity requirements of up to 14 per cent a year, says Mr Mohamed. The government, although keen to shift the emphasis to thermal generation, hopes to build several mini-hydro schemes of up to 5MW to service agricultural estates. Initial outlays would not be excessive and the private sector could become involved. There are no immediate plans to privatise the national grid. There are also ambitious proposals to upgrade and expand other areas of infrastructure, not least in the field of telecommunications which is undergoing rapid change. Over the past few years the existing network has been overhauled and 70 per cent of the exchange capacity connected to an integrated digital system. The once highly erratic system is becoming far more dependable. Direct international dialling, introduced in 1980, is available to 85 countries. A new international exchange and a satellite earth station are to be installed by the end of the year as part of a Dollars 41m scheme financed by the Asian Development Bank. There are still, however, far too few telephones. In 1991 state-owned Sri Lanka Telecom operated 175,000 lines including extensions, only 1.1 telephones per 100 people. There is a waiting list of more than 60,000 and customers say it can take up to 1 1/2 years to have a phone installed. Demand is forecast to reach more than 500,000 by 1995. Sri Lanka Telecom intends to install 200,000 more lines by the end of 1993 and has invited foreign companies to submit joint venture proposals. Interest has already been shown by American Telephone and Telegraph (AT&amp;T) of the US and by companies from Singapore, Korea, and New Zealand, according to Mr Asoka Gunasekera, posts and telecommunications secretary. World Bank funding of Dollars 57m has been secured to increase exchange capacity in Colombo and between some of the island's principal cities. Deregulation is already under way. Licences for value-added services such as cellular telephones and electronic mail have been issued to private companies. As an initial step to transferring the telephone system to private ownership, Sri Lanka Telecom, a state-sponsored corporation, took over administration of the network from the telecommunications department last year. The government is also keen to encourage private sector participation in the road network. It is planning to build a parallel road between Colombo and Katunayake airport, as well as between the capital and Galle in the south. All 'A' class roads radiating from Colombo are currently being upgraded with assistance from the World Bank and the ADB. Finally, the government is keen to expand the capacity of its ports and develop the island's potential as a transshipment route and centre for shipbuilding and repair. Lloyd's List earlier this year ranked the port of Colombo as the best in south Asia and among the best 25 in the world. Colombo, which is extending its container facilities, handled more than 10m tons of cargo last year. The best natural harbour in Asia is at Trincomalee, but its commercial potential has not been properly exploited because of the security situation in the east. Sri Lanka's ability to deliver adequate infrastructure to foreign companies will be of key importance in its bid to reach the status of newly industrialised nation. A good transport network - capable of moving large quantities of goods from the interior to ports and airports - will also be vital in the development of the country's export base. State funds are in short supply. The response of the private sector will be crucial in the years ahead.</p>

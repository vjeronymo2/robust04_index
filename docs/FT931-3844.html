			<p>930313 FT  13 MAR 93 / International Company News: VW confirms Lopez has left key position at GM VOLKSWAGEN, Europe's largest car manufacturer, confirmed yesterday that it has persuaded Mr Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua to leave his job as head of global purchasing at General Motors in the US. The move comes only weeks after GM and VW both denied reports that Mr Lopez, who has a reputation as a tough cost cutter, would be leaving to join the German group as part of an overhaul of VW top management. VW refused to say what Mr Lopez's role would be, but it is widely expected that he will be put in charge of world purchasing following the meeting of the company's supervisory board on Tuesday next week. Mr Lopez, who last year moved within GM from Europe to Detroit, is credited with giving GM the most competitive cost base of any of Europe's volume carmakers. VW sold a record number of cars last year but is labouring under a number of serious problems amid what chief executive Mr Ferdinand Piech last week called the most severe downturn in the German car industry since 1945. Part of the response has been to put pressure on suppliers to cut prices but it is believed that the company plans to implement an overhaul of its sourcing arrangements, headed by Mr Lopez. Operating losses in the core VW division are thought to have been DM1bn (Dollars 619m) last year. The company is planning to cut its workforce by 36,000 people to 276,000 by the end of 1997, a reduction of 13 per cent. Mr Lopez's departure casts doubt on the future of GM's cost reduction programme, which is a vital part of the company's efforts to restore to profit its loss-making North American carmaking operations. GM insisted yesterday that Mr Lopez had put in place a sufficiently strong team, and so changed the group's methods of parts purchasing, that the programme could roll on without him. Some analysts said the costs drive was so much a product of Mr Lopez's iconoclastic management style that it was likely to suffer from his departure after only 10 months in the job.</p>

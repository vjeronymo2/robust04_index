			<p><P> February 1, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SPORTS ET CETERA  </P> <P> Sockers midfielder Brian Quinn, a Major Indoor Soccer League All-Star the past  3 seasons, is expected to be out for 3 weeks because of a strained left arch.  </P> <P> Quinn, who has scored 20 points this season, hurt his arch during the Sockers'  4-3 overtime loss in Dallas Saturday night.  </P> <P> It was originally thought that Quinn had torn a muscle in his foot and might  miss up to 6 weeks.  </P> <P> Coach Ron Newman also said that it is unlikely the Sockers will sign former  Cleveland Force defender John Stollmeyer to replace recently retired Gary  Etherington.  </P> <P> Stollmeyer is a member of the United States national team, and Newman said he  would miss nearly half of the Sockers' remaining games if he were signed.

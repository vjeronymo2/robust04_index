			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / International Company News: Bombardier buys Eurotunnel shares Bombardier, the Canadian aerospace and transport group, has been buying Eurotunnel shares on the stock market. Mr Laurent Beaudoin, chairman, speaking at Bombardier's annual meeting, said he regarded Eurotunnel's share price following the rights issue as highly attractive. Bombardier would not reveal the size of its purchases. 'We may well buy more Eurotunnel shares in the near future, though we don't have any specific target,' he said. 'We are convinced Eurotunnel shares will rally sharply as the Channel Tunnel system comes into full operation in the next year and revenues build up. We are confident the stock will prove an excellent investment for Bombardier shareholders.' Bombardier took delivery of 25m Eurotunnel shares following the completion of the Eurotunnel rights issue as partial compensation for design changes and cost over-runs on its Dollars 600m shuttlecar contract for the tunnel. It also has received CDollars 157m (USDollars 120.7m) in cash. However, it cannot sell any of the block of Eurotunnel shares until the last shuttlecar is delivered next year. Mr Beaudoin announced a 34 per cent increase in Bombardier profits for the 1994 first quarter and said the gain was indicative of results for the full year. Business is strong in all divisions from aerospace, transit equipment to snowmobiles, watercraft and financial services. Losses on the transit equipment side have been reduced and aircraft deliveries will total more than 100 units this year. Bombardier is close to approving plans to build a 70-seater regional jet. Mr Beaudoin said the decision would be made before the end of the year.</p>

			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / Defence overhaul axes 2,000 staff ABOUT 2,000 defence research employees, mainly in the south of England, will lose their jobs in an overhaul of the network of government-owned facilities. Plans announced yesterday by the Defence Research Agency involve abandoning 17 sites, almost a third of the total. About 400 jobs are expected to go in the Portsmouth area of Hampshire, 350 in Dorset and 320 around the DRA's headquarters at Farnborough, Hampshire. It will bring the total employed by the agency to about 9,500. The cuts, to be completed over the next two to three years, come on top of more than 7,000 job losses announced by private-sector defence contractors so far this year. The DRA, set up last April with the aim of putting defence research on a more cost-effective footing, said the measures were intended to save Pounds 90m a year in running costs. Mr John Chisholm, chief executive, said the DRA needed 'radical' measures to ensure its future viability. The DRA was formed as a semi-autonomous agency to take over the activities of four Ministry of Defence units - the Royal Aerospace Establishment, the Admiralty Research Establishment, the Royal Armament Research and Development Establishment and the Royal Signals and Radar Establishment. The agency said all had overlapping support and administrative services. It plans to concentrate on 12 main sites that have been earmarked for 'significant investment', including Farnborough and Fort Halstead in Kent. However, there would be 'substantial consolidation' at three of the sites, at Bromley in Kent, West Drayton, near London, and Farnborough itself, where more land would be offered for sale. The cuts, which had been awaiting ministerial approval, will now be discussed with the unions involved. The DRA said it would also begin 'market-testing' whether some of its activities could be hived off. Some jobs from the axed facilities will also be transferred to other sites, including one at Winfrith in Dorset belonging to the Atomic Energy Agency where the DRA would be a tenant. Unions said the closures and job losses would 'throw Britain's finest skills on the dole and disband world-beating research and development teams'. Mr Jack Dromey, of the TGWU general union and spokesman for the seven unions in the Defence Research Agency, said: 'Our members were beating swords into ploughshares. Now they face the sack because the Treasury wants cuts in the MoD budget.' Mr Derrick Baker, of the GMB general union, said: 'The language of the market is not appropriate for research centres.' He added that the commitment to consult the workforce was worthless if the decisions had already been made.</p>

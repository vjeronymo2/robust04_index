			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, 14 Jun (TANJUG) -- Colonel General Momcilo  Perisic, chief of staff of the Yugoslav Army, said this evening  in an interview for Serbian Radio and Television's first program  that soldiers are never the ones to decide whether there would  be war or not.    In his interview on the occasion of 16 June, Yugoslav Army  day, General Perisic stressed that if it were up to soldiers to  decide on matters of war and peace, they would always opt for  peace, because professionals are well aware of what war entails  and how extensive material destruction can be.    As a professional army, we have been carrying out orders  issued by state structures and implementing political decisions.    The transformation of the Yugoslav Army, Perisic underlined,  is primarily based on the establishment of state control over  national defense, that is All National Defense [Opste Narodna  Odbrana], on a new military doctrine, and other recent  regulations. The basic objective is for us to remain masters in  our own home, to defend the territorial integrity of the Federal  Republic of Yugoslavia [FRY], that is of the Serbs,  Montenegrins, and all national minorities, because this is a  bourgeois state. It is important to develop the defense  capability of society as a whole, especially the army's combat  readiness -- not in the sense of deploying this army outside the  borders of the FRY but, first and foremost, of preventing any  aggressor from threatening the country's security.    The transformation of the Yugoslav Army is based on a series  of real factors. This transformation fully corresponds with our  doctrines, that is, with the protection of the population of our  country. First and foremost, we are bearing in mind the real  threat coming from abroad. We are also bearing in mind our real  material capabilities and, of course, our human resources.    In addition to this, we had to create units that are capable  enough of preempting surprise threats in peacetime and at the  same time flexible enough in wartime to create a massive army in  a short period of time. Naturally, the transformation of the  Yugoslav Army is an ongoing process, a process that encompasses  everything -- ranging from organizational and structural  changes, to the modernization of weaponry and equipment and the  army's visual identity.    Commenting on the fact that the largest part of the military  industry has remained on the territory of the former Yugoslavia,  Perisic said that the loss of territory and military industrial  facilities is certainly a problem besetting today's Yugoslav  Army and the overall defense capabilities of society. By  carrying out an organized evacuation we nevertheless managed to  capture most facilities and to save all our technical  blueprints. Thus, while carrying out the transformation of the  Yugoslav Army, we are also securing conditions for manufacturing  vital pieces of combat equipment in our factories.    The modernization of the army refers primarily to the  modernization of the combat training system and supplying the  army with new hardware, i.e., weapons and systems. During this  period we have managed to replace or substitute the manufacture  of the equipment we used to have until yesterday, either by  modernization or by utilizing the collective scientific brain.  We have managed to develop some new equipment which replaces  the equipment we used to manufacture, only it has far better  features, i.e., far better combat specifications, the chief of  staff stressed.    "In the light of the economic blockade of our country, in  the  light of the fact that a war was and still is being waged in the  area of the former Yugoslavia, all of this has a negative  influence on our total economic power and, consequently, on the  Yugoslav Army too. Anyone who ignores the correlation between a  country's economic potential and the financial resources  earmarked for the army harbors unrealistic views. This is why  the budget earmarked for the Yugoslav Army is precisely as big  as our society could provide at a given moment, namely 7.43  percent of the national product."    In response to the criticism that the Yugoslav army has  perhaps retained some characteristics of the former Yugoslavia,  the general said: The multiparty system has been introduced in  our country, and many party leaders would like to have an army  that suits them and, consequently, not everyone's wishes can be  fulfilled. The most dangerous thing for any army, in any  multiparty society, is the possibility of political parties  interfering in the army's personnel policy. The sharpest  criticism has been that the army has been depoliticized through  the process of transformation. We pay great attention to the  personnel policy, and we know -- and this is perhaps the  greatest contribution to the transformation of the army -- that  the Yugoslav army units are now being led by exceptionally  capable people, people of great knowledge, ability, dignity and  pride, people who are prepared to and capable of predicting  events and making decisions in line with the combat capability  of their units and the overall potentials of our society.    It has always been, and still is, very important in the  training and education of officers for them to be honest toward  their own people and their soldiers, and to be exceptionally  shrewd regarding their enemy.    However, unfortunately, due to wrong training of the  officers  in the Yugoslav People's Army [former Yugoslav army -- JNA], all  their capability was directed toward organizing themselves and  leading the army so as to protect the country from an external  enemy, completely ignoring the possibility of an internal enemy.  Due to their naivety, many acted in a way they should not have  done. Naturally, during this civil war, from Slovenia to Bosnia,  many officers were not up to their task, and they fared as they  deserved.    A JNA unit under a capable officer did not suffer losses in  either its equipment or people, and did not surrender. The  Croats and the Slovenes have achieved everything they have  achieved by deceit or some other method, but certainly not  through armed combat.    Speaking about patriots and patriotism, Perisic said that  this human quality develops and grows throughout one's life.  That is an exceptionally important quality in the Yugoslav  army, I would say a quality without which tasks cannot be  successfully completed. Therefore, in some important aspects,  the officers must be proven patriots. To be a proven patriot  means to be ready to help one's own people in most difficult  times, to share the fate of the people, and to be ready for the  greatest of sacrifices.    General Perisic went on to say that NATO was set up to  protect the interests of its member-states and it ought to be in  the service of all these countries equally.    However, it began serving the interests of one country which  is the architect of the new world order.    It is completely clear that NATO has somehow been abused,  but  in the final analysis, its raison d'etre following the  disintegration of the Warsaw Pact is pointless, unless it wishes  to continue doing what it is doing now.    Of course, many NATO effectives have been brought to the  vicinity of the FRY to support forces which took an active part  in the disintegration of the former Socialist Federal Republic  of Yugoslavia [SFRY], and now in their attack on the republic of  Serb Krajina and the Srpska republic; given that they are in our  immediate vicinity, they are indirectly threatening the security  of the FRY, but we have to know that they are not here only to  help the secessionist forces, but also to exert some pressure on  our country.    Consequently, our country is under a multifold embargo, on  the one hand under a complete economic blockade and on the other  surrounded by NATO warships which pose a kind of threat to the  security of the FRY. However, as we have much experience, and  in the light of the four-year war waged by our compatriots  living outside the FRY, we are aware that their presence could  in a sudden turnabout bring into question the security of the  FRY, and therefore we have been taking certain measures to avoid  surprises of any sort.    Perisic said that the civil war on the territory of the SFRY  came about because of foreign influence and the skillful use of  internal contradictions. As this civil war is primarily based  on religious and national antagonisms, rather than on some other  factors, there is a danger of it spilling over to the territory  of the FRY, following a similar principle. Normally, since the  architects of the new world order, when drawing up their  scenario, did not reckon with the heroic resistance put up by  the people of the two Krajinas, they were halted in some degree.  That process has even been paralyzed, and if we continue to be  united as much as we have to be in order to protect our national  being, then we could even halt that process. Bearing all this  in mind, the FRY has been trying to a maximum degree to stop the  war on the territory of Bosnia as soon as possible, and in this  respect has been offering support to all peace-loving forces in  the world in preventing the spread of the war eastward, i.e., to  this area here.    Perisic was asked: As they are constantly threatening us  with sanctions and bombardment, is there any reason to be  frightened?    Perisic replied: "Certainly, when the very fabric of society  is endangered a certain degree of fear is inevitable."    "In view of our experience throughout history, as well as  the  war under way, waged by our compatriots in the Republic of Serb  Krajina and the [Bosnia] Serb republic under extremely  unfavorable conditions, they have shown us that they could  successfully withstand a numerically far superior opponent for  four years now; moreover, this opponent is backed by the world  media, not only morally but also logistically, including the air  force [as received]. The conclusion to be drawn is that the  Serbian and Montenegrin soldier, the Serbian and Montenegrin  people, and the national minorities are ready and able to defend  themselves -- with the Yugoslav army as their axis."    The general commented on relations with The Former Yugoslav  Republic of Macedonia, which has received UN troops on its  territory, most of whom are Americans. Of course, they are not  there to protect the Macedonian people, but to set up their  bases and, among other things, to help them secure their  borders, as the Macedonians neither have the manpower nor the  material resources to organize a modern army. However, as the  border line is administrative and is not clearly defined,  American soldiers are often apt to get lost and cross onto FRY  territory, either out of ignorance or misinformation. All of  these intrusions have been registered, some were thwarted or  took place without incident.    However, since someone in the world wishes to turn every  border violation into an incident, we are often accused of this.  I had several meetings with the UN commander for Macedonia to  this effect, I warned about frequent border violations and he  promised this would discontinue. Nevertheless, I am not so sure  some of these violations are not deliberate. As far as  accusations that Yugoslavia is amassing troops along the  Macedonian border are concerned, this is "pure media  fabrication."    The situation along the Albanian border is almost identical  in the sense of border incidents.    Young men from Kosovo and Metohija and the Raska region,  Shiptars and Muslims are dodging military service in the  Yugoslav army, and since they are harboring illusions about  violent secession, these young men are being sent for military  training to various centers abroad through different channels.  On their return -- by way of testing their abilities and  smuggling arms on a grand scale -- they are entering our country  illegally. As our border patrols try to prevent them from doing  this, incidents occur. They are using weapons during these  illegal crossings. Unfortunately, these incidents often have  tragic consequences for the infiltrators, which the  unsympathetic world is exploiting very efficiently in its media  campaign against our country, Perisic said.    The Yugoslav army, Perisic said, is a factor of stability  for  Yugoslavia as a whole, including stability in the region of  Kosovo and Metohija, thanks to other elements and the people's  support [as received]. I believe that the average Kosovo  Albanian, that is Shiptar, would never choose the war option  because he can see clearly enough what is happening in regions  where people are trying to resolve something by force.    Second, they can also see the living standards of their  compatriots in Albania. It suffices to climb a mountain near  the border to realize what a vast difference there is between  the economic might and living standards of the Shiptars on this  and on that side of the border, for the Shiptars in Kosovo and  Metohija are at least ten times better off than their  compatriots in Albania. I believe that all they have been  creating under the fold of the FRY and Serbia is such material  wealth that they would hate losing it in some showdown not of  their own choosing, but imposed by their leaders. But they were  wise enough not to have accepted this. If they had, they would  have lost so much. They are aware of this, so I do not believe  such a thing could happen. Even if it does, the army and  militia in Kosovo, as well as other social factors, will be  ready and able to defend the territorial integrity of their own  country.    The Yugoslav army and the FRY leadership are making  tremendous efforts through various international factors and  through political and military factors in Bosnia to effect peace  there as soon as possible -- because we know that only peace,  not any kind of peace but a just peace, can put an end to  destruction and halt the suffering of all three peoples.  However, there can be no peace if all three peoples are not  equally determined to achieve it.    Will there be fresh aggression, a major offensive?    I am certain that a major offensive is a realistic  possibility if the international factors responsible for the  civil war in Bosnia do not exert pressure on the Muslims and  Croats. I am sure that it will not be more successful than the  ones so far, and you know that all of them ended in failure.    If these Muslim-Croat forces, the Muslim-Croat coalition,  were to be aided by certain international factors, especially  NATO, then the situation would naturally be far worse. However,  I do not believe the international community would allow such a  thing to happen, and if it did, the consequences would be  disastrous, not only for the people of the Srpska republic, but  for the entire population of the Balkans, Europe, and further  afield.    Perisic commented on Croatian President Tudjman's statement  that he would return Krajina into Croatia's borders and its  state system by force:    ``In view of the fact that there has been a political rift  in  the Republic of Croatia and that Tudjman is losing ground,  everything is possible -- he could push the Croatian nation into  another war in a feverish attempt to hold on to power. What the  chances are to return the republic of Serb Krajina into  Croatia's borders are perfectly clear from the operations on its  borders so far.    "Even though they engaged the entire country with help from  the international community in a war against a far smaller  nation, they did not manage to do anything; the Serbs have  managed to protect their territorial integrity and did not allow  deeper incursions to be made."    How much can inter-party bickering influence the Yugoslav  army and how much has the army protected itself from internal  political divisions?    ``It is obvious that the unity of a country is inevitably  reflected in the unity of an army. The army is a social  category which in every country, ours included, to a higher or a  lesser degree reflects developments in society. The stronger  the consensus between parties on vital issues of importance for  the survival of a nation, normally the more positively is this  reflected on the overall situation in the army, particularly its  combat morale.    "The stronger the disunity, the stronger influence it has  over the army; but as we have said, the army has been  depoliticized, it has got well-built defense mechanisms for the  prevention of such negative influences, I think that the party  influence on the overall combat readiness of the army is  marginal."    The Yugoslav army peace-time force is by its quality and  quantity completely equipped to prevent any surprises. It is  always capable of taking adequate measures to prevent any  surprises, even under the most adverse conditions. This means  that a very short period of time is necessary to transform the  peace-time force into a war-time force of over 500,000 men,  which now completely suffices to protect the nation from foreign  threats of any kind, Perisic stressed.</p>

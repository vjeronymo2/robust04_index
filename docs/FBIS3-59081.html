			<p>Language: <F P=105> Danish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Defense Minister Elisabeth Rehn, </F> Swedish People's Party presidential candidate, by Maria  Romantschuk in Helsinki; no date given: "Finnish `Queen' Wants  To Be President"]    [Text] Helsinki -- "My leadership will be synonymous with  more openness. Hopefully we will be spared behind-the-scenes  politics. I pay no attention at all to whisperings in the  lobbies."    So said Finnish Defense Minister Elisabeth Rehn, who is well  on the way to making history. She is the first woman in Finland  to have a real chance of becoming president -- the highest  office in political life in Finland.    A month ago few would have guessed that she would do well in  the presidential election. Few believed this only two weeks  ago, but then came the boom. Her star moved into the ascendant  in opinion poll after opinion poll; she became a phenomenon.  Her pet name of "Lillan" gave this boom the name of the "Lillan  phenomenon."    Suddenly many people realized -- and women in particular --  that there was a possibility of getting a woman placed at the  absolute political summit. And this in a country where the  president is not a ceremonial figure, but a person with real  power, as in the United States and France.    The Finnish president controls foreign policy and can do so  without any interference. In the past the president alone could  appoint the government and demand its resignation; now this  happens to an ever increasing extent in consultation with the  political parties and the Eduskunta. However, even today the  president can express a wish for particular ministers. The  choice of prime, foreign, and defense ministers normally happens  in consultation with the president.    Today the president no longer has the power to dismiss the  government and dissolve the Eduskunta. The initiative must come  from the prime minister.    "Very different views are taken of the powers the president  has, depending on who is the president. Some, in harmony with  the constitution, have exercised great power. Others have not  made use of the opportunities in the same way and have been  relatively modest in their exercise of power," Elisabeth Rehn  said in a special interview with BERLINGSKE TIDENDE.    Rehn has followed the debate on whether Finland should have  a  woman president with some amusement and puzzlement, particularly  that section of the debate which has speculated that a woman  would would make less use of power than a man.    "Power has nothing to do with a person's gender. The way in  which you use you power might be different, more feminine and  softer," she pointed out, adding that she will involve more  people in the different decisionmaking processes.    "In today's world it is no longer possible to sit there as  chief and make your decisions alone. The more people there are  involved in the decisionmaking process, the better.    "But the person making the decision must do so very  concisely  and clearly on the basis of experience," Rehn said, promising  that she will do more to make use of the Eduskunta's Foreign  Affairs Committee than outgoing President Mauno Koivisto and his  predecessor, Urho Kekkonen, did.    Rehn is not interested in any major limitations on the  powers  of the president.    The election of the president will take place in two weeks'  time, on 6 February. The choice is between nonsocialist  candidate Rehn and the Social Democrats' candidate, Martti  Ahtisaari. It was last Sunday that these two candidates went  through to the second round in a first round which included 11  candidates. Rehn made history as a woman, as a Finland Swede,  and as a representative of a small party. In the last few years  her party, the Swedish People's Party, has enjoyed support of  around 5 percent -- her personal support in the presidential  election's first round was all of 22 percent.    In the first analyses that have been published since the  first round it has been claimed that her success is not due to  the fact that she is a woman, but to the fact that she is  defense minister -- a ministerial post she has held for almost  four years.    Today when many people feel unease about Finland's huge  neighbor to the east most people would like to have a president  who can help to create security.    Rehn assumes that she is seen as a "safe [tryg] figure" who  has several times referred to the uncertainty factors inherent  in developments in Russia. Then there is her pro-EU [European  Union] attitude, and the fact that she has always stressed the  security which EU membership gives:    "Not military security, but the security that comes from  being part of a broader community."    EU membership will be decided in the final analysis by the  people. The referendum that will be arranged around a year  after the results of the membership negotiations are clear is  not formally binding, but Rehn considers that it is absolutely  binding morally. That is why it is the people who will decide  Finland's destiny vis-a-vis the European Union.    Rehn's attitude to Partnership for Peace is also  unreservedly  positive, even though here too she does not see it as military  security:    "There will in no way be any changes to our defense policy,  if we decide to participate in this partnership."    Earlier this week the Finnish Government decided that in  collaboration with the defense minister the foreign minister  will investigate what Partnership for Peace will mean. The  point of departure is that Finland would like to take part in  the creation of peacekeeping troops, but not in possible future  military actions.    "This is definitely not the first step toward membership of  NATO," Rehn said.    Of the Baltic countries Elisabeth Rehn views Estonia in  particular as important from the Finnish viewpoint.    Our most important neighbors are Sweden, Russia, and  Estonia,  in that order," she said, without downgrading Latvia and  Lithuania as neighbors in the process.    "Estonia is a natural cooperation partner for us.    "What Finland can do for Estonia is to reinforce its  capacity  to maintain surveillance over and guard its own territory and to  help in the creation of commercial ties."    Elisabeth Rehn does not try to hide the fact that she is  where she is today because as a woman defense minister she has  achieved a very prominent position in the mass media, both at  home and abroad. She also admits that it would not have been so  easy to get as far if she had been development aid or social  affairs minister, for example.    "As soon as I have done something as defense minister it is  on the front pages of all the country's newspapers," she said,  regretting the fact that her ability to make an impression as  equality minister -- which she also is -- is not as great.    Elisabeth Rehn said that as president she will be able to  promote Finland in the world. In this she will be different  from a male president.    "A woman can exploit her gender in a different way. Sell and  promote Finland in a positive way. And attract the attention  Finland deserves."    She also noted the commentaries in the foreign press to the  effect that Finland now has a real chance. Even though she is  not wild about being called "Lillan," something that only family  and friends call her, or "the queen," it is something that she  has had to get used to in the last few years. When she visited  the United States a good two years ago, REUTER reported on  "Queen Elisabeth of Finland's visit." She has also been called  president and prime minister.    Now she really does want to be president and sees this as an  chance for Finland.    "Which will probably be lost," she said pessimistically two  weeks before the decisive round of voting, even though today she  is leading in the opinion polls.    The new president will take office on 1 March.</p>

			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / ScottishPower signs deal with Caledonian Paper ScottishPower has signed a Pounds 40m four-year deal to supply electricity to Caledonian Paper, the papermaker based at Irvine in Ayrshire, James Buxton writes. The companies have signed a partnership agreement aimed at co-operating to achieve a 'fault-free' supply of electricity to the plant, which produces 200,000 tonnes of paper a year for magazines. Caledonian Paper, part of Kymmene of Finland, has complained about the quality of its electricity supply. Interruptions to the supply can halt production, costing up to Pounds 100,000 a day in lost output. ScottishPower has indicated that it will be able to supply power to Caledonian Paper if the plant expands, as expected, in a few years.</p>

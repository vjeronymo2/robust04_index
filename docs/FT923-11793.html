			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / World Trade News: Japan to import Mexican Nissans NISSAN's Mexican subsidiary is to export cars to Japan from July next year from a new assembly plant in the central state of Aguascalientes. Initially Nissan Mexicana will send 6,000 to 8,000 units a year of its low-cost Tsuru model but intends to increase this to 40,000 a year before the end of the decade. The export plan forms part of a three-year investment programme by Nissan in Mexico totalling nearly Dollars 1.2bn. Nissan Mexicana is owned 97.8 per cent by Nissan, with the remainder held by Marubeni Corporation. Its announcement comes amid rapid expansion of both Mexico's car market and production. According to Dr Rolf Schlettwein, executive vice-president of the Mexican Investment Board, the market has been growing at 20 per cent plus a year over the past five years and is expected to grow by a further 12 to 15 per cent in each of the next six years. The country is producing about 1m vehicles a year and is projecting that by 2000 this will have more than doubled, with about one third being exported to the US. The Nissan investment forms part of an ambitious expansion programme in Mexico by several vehicle makers which totals more than Dollars 5bn. Mexican inward investment officials are touring Europe seeking to generate interest among Europe's vehicle component makers in setting up operations in Mexico, or expanding existing activities there. The new Nissan plant is to go on stream in November and is expected to reach full capacity of between 100,000 and 120,000 units before the end of 1994.</p>

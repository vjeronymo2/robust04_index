			<p>941108 FT  08 NOV 94 / Romania relaunches state sales The Romanian government yesterday attempted to relaunch its privatisation programme by opening public offerings for three medium-sized state companies, the first such offerings for 18 months. The offers are open first to employees, who will be able to purchase on preferential terms up to 20 per cent of the companies, which are together valued at Lei44.5bn (Pounds 16m). The general public will able to buy up to 30 per cent of the remaining equity later this month. It will be one of the first times the public can use privatisation vouchers distributed in 1992 to bid for companies. Only two companies have been sold by public offer so far under the country's privatisation scheme. Reformers hope the offers will rekindle the population's interest in privatisation and lead to pressure on the government to speed up the process, which has been blocked by conservatives within the governing Party of Social Democracy.</p>

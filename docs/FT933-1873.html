			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / World Trade News: US sticks defiantly to hard line over pact renegotiation THE Clinton administration yesterday showed no sign of backing away from an increasingly hard line against reopening the US-EC Blair House farm trade accord, writes Nancy Dunne in Washington. A spokesman for Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, said any attempt to reopen the pact would be viewed 'with grave concern'. It was 'a painfully wrought compromise in the first place' and even 'clarification' would be unacceptable if it was a cover for renegotiation. President Bill Clinton said last week at a press conference attended by Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, the Italian prime minister, that the EC 'must resist opening this hard-struck bargain'. Otherwise it would be 'standing in the way of efforts to bring the Uruguay Round to a rapid and successful conclusion'. Nineteen US farm groups - most of which have been active advisers in the Uruguay Round negotiations - last week asked the president 'to make clear to the European Community that the commitments made by both parties at Blair House are not negotiable'. They also asked him to press for 'a significant expansion' of market access during the concluding phase of Gatt negotiations. Ironically, it was Mr Kantor who first talked about opening up the Blair House pact, because he thought US farmers had got a bad deal. The farm lobbyists - including the American Farm Bureau, the National Association of Wheat Growers, and the National Corn Growers - are now insisting the Blair House accords 'represent minimal commitments on the part of the EC to reduce its trade distorting export subsidies, restrain surplus oilseed production and maintain zero-duty access for non-grain feed ingredients'. There is increasing bitterness among US business lobbyists against the French and a perception that the US is being blamed for a December 15 Gatt deadline, which coincides with expiry of the US's fast-track negotiating authority. The deadline was agreed after close consultation with US trading partners and Gatt officials, they say. One strategist recommended the US 'multilateralise' its response by calling a meeting of farm exporting countries in favour of farm trade liberalisation. 'The US must not allow itself to be dragged into another US-EC confrontation,' he said. Some US farm lobbyists have noted that the French position is not significantly different from Mr Clinton's strategy to make more acceptable the North American Free Trade Agreement by negotiating labour and environmental side agreements.</p>

			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Endowments - your inflexible friend - Insurance companies are slashing payouts to with-profits policyholders. Philip Coggan examines why THE STOCK market might have had a good year in 1992 but with-profits policyholders could be forgiven for not noticing. A wave of bonus cuts across the sector means that most investors will receive less than those who cashed in policies one year ago. A survey by Money Marketing, conducted with actuary Clay &amp; Partners, found that the average payout on a 10-year endowment policy fell 8.3 per cent from Pounds 8,290 to Pounds 7,603. Payouts on 25-year endowment policies, the kind often used to repay a mortgage, fell less sharply: 1 per cent, from Pounds 37,937 to Pounds 37,585. (For the assumptions, see footnotes to the table). Meanwhile, the FT-A All-Share index rose 15 per cent over the year to March 1. What is the reason for this apparent discrepancy? The prime cause is a malfunction of the 'smoothing' process which is one of the main selling points of with-profits policies. Such policies pay two kinds of bonuses - reversionary (or annual) which are paid every year, and terminal, which are paid at the end of the policy's lifetime. The reversionary bonuses, once paid, cannot be withdrawn. The idea is that the steady build-up of bonuses prevents investors from being hurt by the wild swings of the stock market. Any excess growth can be paid in the form of the terminal bonus. The system went wrong in 1990 - a bad year for investment returns world-wide. Competitive pressures, and an optimistic view of future returns, caused companies to maintain bonuses at unrealistically high levels. Lower economic growth and interest rates since then have forced companies to take a more sober view. In effect, those whose policies matured in 1990 and 1991 received an unjustified windfall; present policyholders are paying the price. The conclusion of the survey is that the trend of falling payouts could continue for some years. That said, insurance companies can point out that those who have maintained their policies until the termination date have received healthy investment returns. The Money Marketing survey shows an average annual yield of 11.4 per cent on 10-year policies, and 12.6 per cent over 25 years. The key requirement, of course, is for investors to maintain their policies until the end of the term. The problem is that many find it difficult to make this commitment. A Securities and Investments Board survey, published late in 1991, showed that 23 per cent of with-profits policies were surrendered in the first two years. Most of those policyholders will have lost a large part of their premiums. The industry attacked the survey's methodology but later admitted that early surrenders were too high. The Money Marketing survey focuses on one aspect of the problem - surrender values after 24 years of a 25-year policy. You might think there would be little difference between the payouts one year apart - and, indeed, there aren't at such companies as Norwich Union and Equitable Life. The table shows that the proportion of final payouts they deliver after 24 years is 92 and 91 per cent respectively. But this is not so at Royal Insurance, which pays just 50 per cent of the final proceeds after 24 years. On the Money Marketing assumptions, this would cost the policyholder almost Pounds 18,500. There is an argument that policies should be designed to discourage short-term investors but anyone who has stuck it out for 24 years is hardly a fly-by-nighter. The good news, at least, is that the industry seems to be recognising the injustice of this and improving late surrender values. The average surrender value after 24 years actually increased 4.5 per cent last year, even though final payouts were falling. A related issue is the percentage of final payout which consists of the terminal bonus. The higher the percentage, the more risky the policy. The tables thus show payouts with and without this bonus. Commercial Union comes out ahead, if terminal bonuses are excluded, over both 10 and 25 years (and, indeed, the 15- and 20-year periods as well). If the terminal bonuses are included, then General Accident takes over from Standard Life as the top-paying company over 25 years. Royal London, which is top over 10 years, had not announced its payout by March 1, the end-date for the survey. So, the table could change later this year. At the other end of the scale, the worst performances have been produced by Guardian Royal Exchange and the Life Association of Scotland. GRE is bottom of the tables over 10 and 25 years; LAS over 15 and 20. The 25-year return from GRE was Pounds 29,260 - just two-thirds of the figure achieved by General Accident. If you invest in a poorly performing unit trust, you can simply move your money elsewhere. But if you are, say, seven years into a GRE policy, your options are much more limited. If you surrender the policy, you will pay heavy penalties. You can keep making payments in the hope either of selling the policy in the second-hand market after a few more years or that GRE's performance improves. Either way, you risk throwing good money after bad. You could make the policy paid-up (stop paying premiums but leave what you have already invested alone); but this might be difficult if your policy is linked to a mortgage. In short, an endowment policy is an inflexible friend  -which makes their mass marketing all the harder to understand. Money Marketing also reports a worrying tendency for some companies to refuse to supply figures. The main reason for this trend - cited by, for example, Scottish Equitable - is that companies have ceased to market traditional with-profits policies and are concentrating on the unitised version (see Barry Riley's article on this page). As Money Marketing comments, if this trend continues, it will be very difficult for advisers and policyholders to monitor their investments. And the natural suspicion is that, away from the glare of publicity, returns will fall rather than rise. Copies of the survey are available for Pounds 3.75 from Ian Paxton at Money Marketing on 071-439 4222.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- TOP TEN ENDOWMENT PAYOUTS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- TEN YEARS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Exc terminal bonus          Pounds     Inc term bonus            Pounds  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Commercial Union             6,827     Royal London*              8,566 Tunbridge Wells              6,558     Tunbridge Wells            8,507 Clerical Medical             6,348     Equitable Life             8,505 London Life                  6,334     Commercial Union           8,364 Scottish Provident           6,263     Norwich Union              8,198 Scottish Mutual              6,252     Clerical Medical           8,125 Norwich Union                6,193     Pearl*                     8,047 Sun Life                     6,173     Friends Provident          8,033 Legal &amp; General*             6,166     Scottish Provident         8,017 Royal Insurance              6,164     Standard Life              8,006  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Based on a non-smoking male aged 29 at inception paying Pounds 35 a month.  *indicates company which declared bonus after March 1 - figures based on last year's announcement.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- TWENTY-FIVE YEARS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Exc terminal bonus          Pounds     Inc term bonus            Pounds  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Commercial Union            29,914     General Accident          43,679 Eagle Star                  25,409     Standard Life             42,170 Norwich Union               22,738     Commercial Union          41,880 Legal &amp; General*            21,989     Tunbridge Wells           41,858 Royal Insurance             20,755     Royal London*             41,252 Royal London*               20,201     Legal &amp; General*          41,107 Scottish Widows             19,715     Scottish Life             41,064 General Accident            19,242     Friends Provident         41,039 Clerical Medical            18,802     Clerical Medical          40,800 Scottish Provident          18,801     AXA Equity &amp; Law          40,685  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Based on a non-smoking male aged 29 at outset paying Pounds 20 a month. *Company declared bonus after March 1 and figures based on last year's announcement.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SURRENDER/MATURITY VALUE RATIOS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- TOP FIVE               %       BOTTOM FIVE           %  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Norwich Union         92       Sun Life             75 Equitable Life        91       Friends Provident    74 Scottish Widows       90       Royal London*        73 Scottish Life         89       Pearl*               66 London Life           89       Royal Insurance      50  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Money Marketing.

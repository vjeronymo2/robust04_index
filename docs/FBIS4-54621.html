Trade Minister Valentin Karabashev, the sponsor  of the scheme, said the licensing rules and minimum prices were  intended to protect Bulgarian producers. The cabinet set the  following minimum import prices: $2.5 a kilo for rubber tires,  $0.15 apiece for filament lamps, $0.60 apiece for fluorescent  lamps, $3 apiece for mercury-vapor lamps, and $400-450 a ton for  steel pipes. Last year, a sharp rise in imports of these goods  affected the domestic market, Karabashev said. These  developments and the loss of traditional markets for Bulgarian  exports harmed local producers, who have been demanding  protectionist measures. The Ministry of Trade in 1993 raised  customs duties to the maximum possible within the effective  customs duty schedule, but the measure proved insufficient. The  restrictions will apply for a year and may be lifted in six  months if they prove successful.

			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / Survey of Zimbabwe (4): Privatisation snags - Stock exchange In the 18 months since the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange was opened up to foreign portfolio investment, market capitalis- ation has quadrupled in local currency terms to ZDollars 16.8bn, more than trebling to USDollars 2bn in hard currency value. Foreign buyers, with net purchases of ZDollars 546m since July 1993, have played only a minor role, with the main impetus coming from the return of domestic investors as the economy recovers from the 1992 drought. After peaking at 2,732 in September 1991, the industrials share price index collapsed to a low of 870 in January 1993. By the time exchange control was liberal- ised to allow foreign portfolio investors to buy up to 25 per cent of any listed company, with no single investor holding over 5 per cent, the index was hovering at the 1,000 mark. The market surged 55 per cent in the third quarter last year and another 65 per cent in the final three months to reach 2,562. Strong foreign buying took the market to a new high of 3,832 in March, since when it has settled around the 3,550 level. The conventional wisdom among market analysts is that with the average price/earnings ratio on Industrials down to 11.8 in early Novem- ber from a March peak of nearly 17, the market is set to break through the 4,000 barrier once interest rates come off the top and the flood of new and rights offers has been digested. In the closing months of 1994, one small new issue (Dollars 3.2m) and rights calls of another ZDollars 366m (Dollars 44m) have eaten into the institutional demand which accounts for some 80 per cent, by volume, of turnover. The limits on foreign participation relate only to post-June 1993 purchases, since well over half the 63 listed companies are foreign- controlled. Today, 'new' port- folio investors, as distinct from long-standing holders with management control, account for just 4 per cent of the shareholdings. After two years of minimal primary market activity, more than ZDollars 700m will have been raised this year, including two new listings by Chloride and Eastern Highlands Plantations. Many in business and the financial sector believe the stock market should be used in the privatisation process and also to contribute towards solving the indigenisation crisis. But advocates of indigenisation have little time for the exchange - 'a white man's casino' is how one dis- misses it - demanding direct discrimination along Malay- sian lines whereby companies were forced to sell shares to Bumiputra individuals and businesses. With Ashanti Goldfields stars in their eyes, emerging market fund managers see privatisation as an opportunity for enhanced participation in Zimbabwe. But there are snags: first, with the indigen- isation lobby and the official media on its back, the govern- ment will find it difficult to sell substantial chunks of 'the family silver' to foreigners, especially 'hit and run' foreign funds, as one dealer calls them. Perhaps an even greater obstacle is the state of the parastatal sector balance sheet. In the past eight years, the main parastatals have run up losses of over ZDollars 5bn and as of March were in debt to the tune of ZDollars 12bn, with annual interest charges of ZDollars 3.5bn. Only a handful of the parastatals are in fit state to be sold, and of these, some obvious candid- ates, such as the telecommun- ications utility, have been ruled out of contention on 'strategic' grounds though this may well change as World Bank and IMF pressures inten- sify after next year's elections.</p>

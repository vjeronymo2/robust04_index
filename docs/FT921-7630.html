			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / Preview of the Results Season: Can't pay, won't pay - could pay, should pay? THE MOST difficult decision that many company directors will have to make on the eve of their results announcement is what dividend to pay. Last autumn several companies in danger of having insufficient earnings to cover 1991's dividends decided to hold the interim payment. They hoped that by this spring, when a decision would have to be made on the final, the economic recovery would have arrived to justify maintenance. It has not. Although crystal ball-gazing about the recovery will play a part in the decision, the uncertainty will throw directors back on a variety of other criteria. Is the cash available and, if so, is this the first call on it? If retained profit is insufficient, should the company dip into balance sheet reserves to make up the difference? What do the shareholders want and how obliged is the company to them? The cash problem is epitomised by Costain, the construction, property and mining group. With year-end gearing estimated at 60 per cent even after a Pounds 77m rights issue and a Pounds 101m disposal, it has warned it might cut the final. A yield of about 9 per cent on the interim dividend alone indicates the level of market pessimism. High debt is seen as a potential justification for reducing the dividend even by Mr Paddy Linaker, chief executive of M&amp;G Group, the fund management concern, who has become sensitive at being cast as an outspoken advocate of maintaining pay-outs. In a recession that 'has been worse than most of us thought likely', he says M&amp;G accepts that some companies will have to cut. 'We are not suggesting that companies should irresponsibly maintain their distribution.' His reminders to companies of the importance of dividend income to investors are simply statements of the 'blindingly obvious', he says. Different companies have different priorities for their cash. A growing company will see dividends as a diversion of funds from investment. Spring Ram, the kitchens and bathrooms group, has a yield of 0.2 per cent. Mr Bill Rooney, its chairman, said recently that a 5 per cent yield would cost Pounds 23m - 'I can build two factories for that.' Its share price, on the other hand, has doubled in the past 12 months. Some companies facing an uncovered dividend as profits have slumped have nevertheless felt impelled to keep up capital spending. T&amp;N and GKN, the car component makers, for instance, have continued to modernise plant to ensure international competitiveness, particularly against the Japanese and the Germans. The market perceives a greater risk to the dividend at T&amp;N, which faces a higher bill even if holds the payment because of extra shares in issue. The case for reducing the dividend could refer to the views of Mr Paul Myners, chairman of Gartmore Investment Management. He says the long-term interests of shareholders are not served 'if maintaining the dividend starves the company of important investment'. Some companies have been locked into an excessive level of distribution and they should reduce the payment to a level from which it can grow. But a contrary view can equally well be applied to T&amp;N. With its balance sheet strengthened by a Pounds 119m rights issue, year-end gearing is expected to be below 35 per cent and maintaining the dividend would only put a small dent in the balance sheet. Using Kleinwort Benson's forecast of a 36 per cent pre-tax profit fall to Pounds 45m and a 60 per cent tax charge, the Pounds 43m total dividend bill will knock Pounds 25m off reserves. That is only 5 per cent of the December 1990 (pre-rights issue) figure for shareholders' funds. Mr Clive Gilchrist, chairman of the investment committee of the National Association of Pension Funds, says: 'Generally speaking, the dividend is a relatively minor cost to a company. They should think seriously before committing themselves to a course of action that may rebound.' Cutting the dividend can send the message that the board lacks confidence in the outlook and is 'chopping and changing' its policy. His view is that a maintained dividend in recession should be the quid pro quo for increasing it at a much slower rate than earnings in the good years. The decision to maintain may be easier for companies that regard their investment bulge as over. Harrisons &amp; Crosfield, the chemicals, building supplies and animal feed company, falls into this category after putting together the Harcros builders' merchant chain. And as its shares have tended to be bought for an above average yield, shareholders will expect a high priority to be given to dividend maintenance. Rewarding shareholder loyalty - especially when there has been a rights issue within the last year or two - is also a factor. While it might be a bit crude to suggest that maintaining the dividend is one way to buy a bit more loyalty when a weak share price suggests bid vulnerability, a message of confidence in the future is a sound defensive move. As share price falls at British Steel and Trafalgar House showed, it may not be enough to maintain the dividend this time while warning that the next one might be cut. On the other hand, Mr Myners of GIM points to two examples - Coats Viyella and Midland Bank - where the share price recovered after results announcements in spite of a dividend reduction. He is concerned that dividend distribution, in general, may have become too high through excessive increases in the good years. The chart shows that dividend cover in this recession is lower than during the last one. The income demands on companies may have become too strong through 'too many investment packages based on a requirement for high distribution'. 'If they want income, they should buy bonds,' Mr Myners says. There is, however, one point on which fund managers should be able to agree: they would like companies to have a consistent dividend policy and to state the criteria they have used for fixing payments. One said rather wearily that the decision seemed sometimes to be based on the finance director ringing up the broker to ask what the market was expecting. A transparent policy would make it easier for companies' varying priorities to be properly understood.</p>

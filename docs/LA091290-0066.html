			<p><P> September 12, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TEXT OF BUSH'S SPEECH: 'IT IS IRAQ AGAINST THE WORLD'  </P> <P> Here is the text of President Bush's address to Congress on Tuesday night, as  released in advance by the White House:  </P> <P> Mr. President, Mr. Speaker, members of the Congress, distinguished guests,  fellow Americans, thank you.  </P> <P> We gather tonight, witness to events in the Persian Gulf as significant as they  are tragic. In the early morning hours of August 2nd, following negotiations  and promises by Iraq's dictator Saddam Hussein not to use force, a powerful  Iraqi army invaded its trusting and much weaker neighbor, Kuwait. Within three  days, 120,000 Iraqi troops with 850 tanks had poured into Kuwait, and moved  south to threaten Saudi Arabia. It was then I decided to check that aggression.  </P> <P> At this moment, our brave servicemen and women stand watch in that distant  desert and on distant seas, side-by-side with the forces of more than 20 other  nations.  </P> <P> They are some of the finest men and women of the United States of America. And  they're doing one terrific job.  </P> <P> These valiant Americans were ready at a moment's notice to leave their spouses,  their children, to serve on the front-line halfway around the world. They  remind us who keeps America strong. They do.  </P> <P> In the trying circumstances of the gulf, the morale of our servicemen and women  is excellent. In the face of danger, they are brave, well-trained and  dedicated.  </P> <P> A soldier, Pfc. Wade Merritt of Knoxville, Tenn., now stationed in Saudi  Arabia, wrote his parents of his worries, his love of family and his hopes for  peace. But Wade also wrote: "I am proud of my country and its firm stand  against inhumane aggression. I am proud of my Army and its men . . . I am proud  to serve my country."  </P> <P> Let me just say, Wade, America is proud of you. And grateful to every soldier,  sailor, Marine and airman serving the cause of peace in the Persian Gulf.  </P> <P> I also want to thank the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Powell,  the chiefs, our commander in the Persian Gulf, General Schwartzkopf, and the  men and women of the Department of Defense -- what a magnificent job you are  doing.  </P> <P> I wish I could say their work is done. But we all know it is not.  </P> <P> So if ever there was a time to put country before self and patriotism before  party, that time is now. Let me thank all Americans, especially those in this  chamber, for your support for our forces and their mission.  </P> <P> That support will be even more important in the days to come.  </P> <P> So tonight, I want to talk to you about what is at stake -- what we must do  together to defend civilized values around the world, and maintain our economic  strength at home.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Objectives Are Clear  </P> <P> Our objectives in the Persian Gulf are clear, our goals defined and familiar:  </P> <P> Iraq must withdraw from Kuwait completely, immediately -- and without  condition.  </P> <P> Kuwait's legitimate government must be restored.  </P> <P> The security and stability of the Persian Gulf must be assured.  </P> <P> American citizens abroad must be protected.  </P> <P> These goals are not ours alone. They have been endorsed by the U.N. Security  Council five times in as many weeks. Most countries share our concern for  principle. And many have a stake in the stability of the Persian Gulf. This is  not, as Saddam Hussein would have it, the United States against Iraq. It is  Iraq against the world.  </P> <P> As you know, I've just returned from a very productive meeting with Soviet  President Gorbachev. I am pleased that we are working together to build a new  relationship. In Helsinki, our joint statement affirmed to the world our shared  resolve to counter Iraq's threat to peace. Let me quote: "We are united in the  belief that Iraq's aggression must not be tolerated. No peaceful international  order is possible if larger states can devour their smaller neighbors."  </P> <P> Clearly, no longer can a dictator count on East-West confrontation to stymie  concerted U.N. action against aggression.  </P> <P> A new partnership of nations has begun.  </P> <P> We stand today at a unique and extraordinary moment. The crisis in the Persian  Gulf, as grave as it is, also offers a rare opportunity to move toward a  historic period of cooperation. Out of these troubled times, our fifth  objective -- a new world order -- can emerge: A new era -- freer from the  threat of terror, stronger in the pursuit of justice, and more secure in the  quest for peace. An era in which the nations of the world, East and West, North  and South, can prosper and live in harmony.  </P> <P> A hundred generations have searched for this elusive path to peace, while a  thousand wars raged across the span of human endeavor. Today that new world is  struggling to be born. A world quite different from the one we've known. A  world where the rule of law supplants the rule of the jungle. A world where the  rule of law supplants the rule of the jungle. A world in which nations  recognize the shared responsibility for freedom and justice. A world where the  strong respect the rights of the weak.  </P> <P> This is the vision I shared with President Gorbachev in Helsinki. He, and other  leaders from Europe, the gulf and around the world, understand that how we  manage this crisis today could shape the future for generations to come.  </P> <P> </P> <P> First Test of Mettle  </P> <P> The test we face is great -- and so are the stakes. This is the first assault  on the new world we seek, the first test of our mettle. Had we not responded to  this first provocation with clarity of purpose, if we do not continue to  demonstrate our determination, it would be a signal to actual and potential  despots around the world.  </P> <P> America and the world must defend common vital interests. And we will.  </P> <P> America and the world must support the rule of law. And we will.  </P> <P> And one thing more -- in pursuit of these goals America will not be  intimidated.  </P> <P> Vital issues of principle are at stake. Saddam Hussein is literally trying to  wipe a country off the face of the Earth.  </P> <P> We do not exaggerate.  </P> <P> Nor do we exaggerate when we say: Saddam Hussein will fail.  </P> <P> Vital economic interests are at risk as well. Iraq itself controls some 10% of  the world's proven oil reserves. Iraq plus Kuwait controls twice that. An Iraq  permitted to swallow Kuwait would have the economic and military power, as well  as the arrogance, to intimidate and coerce its neighbors -- neighbors who  control the lion's share of the world's remaining oil reserves. We cannot  permit a resource so vital to be dominated by one so ruthless. And we won't.  </P> <P> Recent events have surely proven that there is no substitute for American  leadership. In the face of tyranny, let no one doubt American credibility and  reliability.  </P> <P> Let no one doubt our staying power. We will stand by our friends. One way or  another, the leader of Iraq must learn this fundamental truth.  </P> <P> From the outset, acting hand-in-hand with others, we've sought to fashion the  broadest possible international response to Iraq's aggression. The level of  world cooperation and condemnation of Iraq is unprecedented.  </P> <P> Armed forces from countries spanning four continents are there at the request  of King Fahd of Saudi Arabia to deter and if need be to defend against attack.  Muslims and non-Muslims, Arabs and non-Arabs, soldiers from many nations, stand  shoulder to shoulder, resolute against Saddam Hussein's ambitions.  </P> <P> We can now point to five United Nations Security Council resolutions that  condemn Iraq's aggression. They call for Iraq's immediate and unconditional  withdrawal, the restoration of Kuwait's legitimate government, and  categorically reject Iraq's cynical and self-serving attempt to annex Kuwait.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Hostage Policy Firm  </P> <P> Finally, the U.S. has demanded the release of all foreign nationals held  hostage against their will, and in contravention of international law. It is a  mockery of human decency to call these people "guests." They are hostages, and  the whole world knows it.  </P> <P> Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said it all: "We do not bargain over hostages.  We will not stoop to the level of using human beings as bargaining (chips).  Ever."  </P> <P> Of course, our hearts go out to the hostages and their families. But our policy  cannot change. And it will not change. America and the world will not be  blackmailed.  </P> <P> We are now in sight of a United Nations that performs as envisioned by its  founders. We owe much to the outstanding leadership of Secretary General Perez  de Cuellar. The U.N. is backing up its words with action. The Security Council  has imposed mandatory economic sanctions on Iraq, designed to force Iraq to  relinquish the spoils of its illegal conquest. The Security Council has also  taken the obvious step of authorizing the use of all means necessary to ensure  compliance with these sanctions.  </P> <P> Together with our friends and allies, ships of the United States Navy are today  patrolling Mideast waters. They have already intercepted more than 700 ships to  enforce the sanctions. Three regional leaders I spoke with yesterday (Monday)  told me that these sanctions are working. Iraq is feeling the heat.  </P> <P> We continue to hope that Iraq's leaders will recalculate just what their  aggression has cost them. They are cut off from world trade. Unable to sell  their oil. And only a tiny fraction of goods gets through.  </P> <P> At home, the material cost of our leadership can be steep. That's why Secretary  of State Baker and Treasury Secretary Brady have met with many world leaders to  underscore that the burden of this collective effort must be shared. We are  prepared to do our share and more to help carry that load; we insist that  others do their share as well.  </P> <P> The response of most of our friends and allies has been good. To help defray  costs, the leaders of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates have  pledged to provide our deployed troops with all the food and fuel they need.  Generous assistance will also be provided to stalwart front-line nations, such  as Turkey and Egypt.  </P> <P> I am also heartened to report that this international response extends to the  neediest victims of this conflict -- the refugees. For our part, we have  contributed $28 million for relief efforts. This is but a portion of what is  needed. I commend, in particular, Saudi Arabia, Japan, and several European  nations who have joined us in this humanitarian effort.  </P> <P> There is an energy-related cost to be borne as well. Oil-producing nations are  already replacing lost Iraqi and Kuwaiti output. More than half of what was  lost has been made up. We are getting superb cooperation. If producers,  including the United States, continue steps to expand oil and gas production,  we can stabilize prices and guarantee against hardship. Additionally, we and  several of our allies always have the option to extract oil from our strategic  petroleum reserves, if conditions warrant. As I have pointed out before,  conservation efforts are essential to keep our energy needs as low as possible.  We must then take advantage of our energy sources across the board: Coal,  natural gas, hydro and nuclear. Our failure to do these things has made us more  dependent on foreign oil that ever before. Finally, let no one even contemplate  profiteering from this crisis.  </P> <P> I cannot predict just how long it will take to convince Iraq to withdraw from  Kuwait. Sanctions will take time to have their full intended effect. We will  continue to review all options with our allies, but let it be clear: We will  not let this aggression stand.  </P> <P> Our interest, our involvement in the gulf, is not transitory. It predated  Saddam Hussein's aggression, and will survive it. Long after all our troops  come home, there will be a lasting role for the United States in assisting the  nations of the Persian Gulf. Our role, with others, is to deter future  aggression. Our role is to help our friends in their own self-defense. And  something else: to curb the proliferation of chemical, biological, ballistic  missile and above all, nuclear technologies.  </P> <P> Let me also make clear that the United States has no quarrel with the Iraqi  people. Our quarrel is with Iraq's dictator, and with his aggression. Iraq will  not be permitted to annex Kuwait. That's not a threat, or a boast, that's just  the way it's going to be.  </P> <P> Our ability to function effectively as a great power abroad depends on how we  conduct ourselves here at home. Our economy, our armed forces, our energy  dependence, and our cohesion all determine whether we can help our friends and  stand up to our foes.  </P> <P> For America to lead, America must remain strong and vital. Our world leadership  and domestic strength are mutual and reinforcing; a woven piece, as strongly  bound as Old Glory.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Must Reduce Deficit  </P> <P> To revitalize our leadership capacity, we must address our budget deficit --  not after election day, or next year, but now.  </P> <P> Higher oil prices slow our growth, and higher defense costs would only make our  fiscal deficit problem worse. That deficit was already greater than it should  have been -- a projected $232 billion for the coming year. It must -- it will  -- be reduced.  </P> <P> To my friends in Congress, together we must act this very month -- before the  next fiscal year begins October first -- to get America's economic house in  order. The gulf situation helps us realize we are more economically vulnerable  than we ever should be. Americans must never again enter any crisis -- economic  or military -- with an excessive dependence on foreign oil and an excessive  burden of federal debt.  </P> <P> Most Americans are sick and tired of endless battles in the Congress and  between the branches over budget matters. It is high time we pulled together --  and get the job done right. It is up to us to straighten this out.  </P> <P> This job has four basic parts.  </P> <P> First: The Congress should, this month, within a budget agreement, enact  growth-oriented tax measures -- to help avoid recession in the short term; and  to increase savings, investment, productivity and competitiveness for the  longer term. These measures include extending incentives for research and  experimentation; expanding the use of IRAs for new homeowners; establishing  tax-deferred family savings accounts; creating incentives for the creation of  enterprise zones and initiatives to encourage more domestic drilling, and, yes,  reducing the tax rate for capital gains.  </P> <P> Second: The Congress should, this month, enact a prudent multi-year defense  program -- one that reflects not only the improvement in East-West relations,  but our broader responsibilities to deal with the continuing risks of outlaw  action and regional conflict. Even with our obligations in the gulf, a sound  defense budget can have some reduction in real terms, and we are prepared to  accept that. But to go beyond such levels, where cutting defense would threaten  our vital margin of safety, is something I will never accept.  </P> <P> The world is still dangerous. Surely that is now clear. Stability is not  secure. American interests are far-reaching. Interdependence has increased. The  consequences of regional instability can be global. This is no time to risk  America's capacity to protect her vital interests.  </P> <P> Third: The Congress should, this month, enact measures to increase domestic  energy production and energy conservation -- in order to reduce dependence on  foreign oil. These measures should include my proposals to increase incentives  for domestic oil and gas exploration, fuel-switching, and to accelerate the  development of Alaskan energy resources, without damage to wildlife.  </P> <P> As you know, when the oil embargo was imposed in the early 1970s, the United  States imported almost 6 million barrels of oil per day. This year, before the  Iraqi invasion, U.S. imports had risen to nearly 8 million barrels per day. We  had moved in the wrong direction. Now we must act to correct that trend.  </P> <P> Fourth: The Congress should, this month, enact a five-year program to reduce  the projected debt and deficits by $500 billion -- that is, by half a trillion  dollars. If, with the Congress, we can develop a satisfactory program by the  end of the month, we can avoid the ax of "sequester" -- deep across-the-board  cuts that would threaten our military capacity and risk substantial domestic  disruption.  </P> <P> I want to be able to tell the American people we have truly solved the deficit  problem. For me to do that, a budget agreement must meet these tests:  </P> <P> It must include the measures I've recommended to increase economic growth and  reduce dependence on foreign oil.  </P> <P> It must be fair. All should contribute, but the burden should not be excessive  for any one group of programs or people.  </P> <P> It must address the growth of government's hidden liabilities.  </P> <P> It must reform the budget process, and further: It must be real.  </P> <P> I urge Congress to provide a comprehensive five-year deficit reduction program  to me as a complete legislative package -- with measures to assure that it can  be fully enforced. America is tired of phony deficit reduction, or promise-now,  save-later-plans. Enough is enough. It is time for a program that is credible  and real.  </P> <P> * Finally, to the extent that the deficit reduction program includes new  revenue measures, it must avoid any measure that would threaten economic growth  or turn us back toward the days of punishing income tax rates. That is one path  we should not head down again.  </P> <P> I have been pleased with recent progress, although it has not always seemed so  smooth.  </P> <P> But now it is time to produce.  </P> <P> I hope we can work out a responsible plan. But with or without agreement from  the budget summit, I ask both houses of the Congress to allow a straight  up-or-down vote on a complete $500-billion deficit reduction package -- not  later than Sept. 28.  </P> <P> If the Congress cannot get me a budget, then Americans will have to face a  tough, mandated sequester.  </P> <P> I am hopeful, in fact I am confident, the Congress will do what it should. And  we in the Executive Branch will do our part.  </P> <P> In the final analysis, our ability to meet our responsibilities abroad depends  upon political will and consensus at home. This is never easy in democracies --  where we govern only with the consent of the governed. And although free people  in a free society are bound to have their differences, Americans traditionally  come together in times of adversity and challenge.  </P> <P> Once again, Americans have stepped forward to share a tearful goodby with their  families before leaving for a strange and distant shore. At this very moment,  they serve together with Arabs, Europeans, Asians and Africans in defense of  principle and the dream of a new world order. That is why they sweat and toil  in the sand and the heat and the sun.  </P> <P> If they can come together under such adversity; if old adversaries like the  Soviet Union and the United States can work in common cause, then surely we who  are so fortunate to be in this great chamber -- Democrats, Republicans,  Liberals, Conservatives -- can come together to fulfill our responsibilities  here.  </P> <P> Thank you, good night, and God Bless America.  </P></p>

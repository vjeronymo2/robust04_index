			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 19 (YONHAP) -- With South Korean  President Kim Yong-sam's upcoming visit to Beijing supplying the  momentum, efforts to create a Northeast Asian economic  cooperation system will take concrete shape, Korean Ambassador  to China Hwang Pyong-tae said Friday.    In an interview with South Korean correspondents posted in  Beijing, Hwang said that during the president's visit beginning  March 26, South Korea and China will sign a number of agreements  to solidify bilateral cooperation -- especially in the economic  arena.    "The creation of a close cooperative system between South  Korea and China would lead ultimately to singularizing the two  countries' markets," he said.    The ambassador said this would eventually prompt Japan to  join the single market, making it a base for a Northeast Asian  economic system geared toward non-tariffication in the region.    According to Hwang, the Korean-Chinese agreements to be  signed include the creation of a joint industrial cooperation  committee and memoranda on the promotion of joint ventures in  electronic switchboards, airplanes, automobiles and  high-definition television.    A source said a memorandum of understanding on bilateral  cooperation in communications equipment would include provisions  governing the joint development of next-generation  communications equipment and China's approval of a  Korea-developed TDX electronic switchboard model being produced  by a Korean firm active in Shandong Province.    The memorandum will likely be signed during President Kim's  visit by Communications Minister Yun Tong-yun and his Chinese  counterpart, Posts and Communications Minister Wu Jichuan.    "The approval of the TDX model paves the way for possible  adoption of the Korean model in all areas of China," the source  said.    "Besides, China is expected to formally adopt the TDX  switchboards in modernizing telephone facilities in the two  Provinces of Shandong and Hunan."    In an airplane project, the two countries would jointly  develop a prototype of a 100-seat passenger plane for sale to  third countries, the source said.    A memorandum on automobile cooperation would call for Korean  firms' advancement into China via "production of auto parts  first and joint development and production of auto models later."    Daewoo Motor is already doing business in China through a  tie-up with a Chinese firm following the same pattern. Daewoo's  joint-venture company produces parts for about 300,000 vehicles  a year.    By 1998 the firm plans to build an assembly plant capable of  turning out about 150,000 units a year.    In addition, the two countries are planning to cooperate in  such high-tech areas as high-definition television, atomic  energy, rockets and satellites, the source said.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Santiago de Cuba correspondent Carlos Zanabria </F> and "Doing Radio" program host Orlando Contreras -- live]    [Text] [Zanabria] It has rained intensely in Santiago de  Cuba.    [Contreras] This weekend?    [Zanabria] In the last 94 hours ...[corrects] in the last 72  hours the amount of rainfall in Santiago de Cuba Province has  been tremendous.    [Contreras] Approximately how many millimeters?    [Zanabria] Tercer Frente is the municipality where the most  rainfall, over 300 mm, has been recorded in the last few hours.    [Contreras] Excuse me, how much did you say?    [Zanabria] Over 300 mm of rainfall in less than 24 hours.    [Contreras] Over 300 mm of rainfall. This is the rainfall  recorded in many provinces during one entire year.    [Zanabria] For this municipality it is the average amount of  rainfall for one year.    [Contreras] As I said, that would be the amount of rainfall  expected in one year, and it fell within a 24-hour period.    [Zanabria] Exactly, and the same thing happened in Songo-La  Maya where rainfall has been intense. In Santiago de Cuba 116 mm  of rainfall fell in the last few hours.    [Contreras] I imagine that the floodgates of most dams are  open.    [Zanabria] Yes. There are over 3,000 houses damaged, with  over 1,000 of these in Santiago de Cuba Municipality, 80 of  which were totally destroyed. In the municipality of Guama,  unfortunately, there has been a fatality: Juan Gonzalez Jinarte,  who was drunk and drowned while trying to cross a local river  with his mules.    [Contreras] This was the only fatality?    [Zanabria] No, this was the second fatality. The first  fatality occurred in Segundo Frente Municipality.    [Contreras] Given the magnitude of the rainfall, there have  been very few vicitms.    [Zanabria] There were also fires this weekend in the  Hermanos  Diaz refinery and the Retome medical equipment factory. There  have been many landslides, and floods in low-lying areas.    I am preparing a complete report for Doing Radio listeners,  and then I will go out with the mobile unit and visit some of  the places affected, for instance, the Rente Electric Plant  which is off-line from the national electrical system. This is  of great importance. Last night [22 May] there were long power  outages in Santiago de Cuba, and in the midst of this rain, so  you can imagine the situation here.    [Contreras] We await further information. I believe the news  that you have given us up to now is outright poignant. There is  another fatality in Santiago, and we can imagine that last night  must have been very tense, considering everything that is  happening.    [Zanabria] Last night, I spoke with the pilot of the  (Aero-Caribbean) flight that arrived in Santiago de Cuba. I went  to pick up Diosdado Maso and accompany Carmen Oria to the  airport, as she was returning to Havana. The pilot informed me  that he does not know how he managed to land at the Holguin  airport, where the plane made a stopover, because the rainfall  made it almost impossible to see the runway lights.    That is the situation here; and as I said earlier, I am  about  to visit some of the most hard-hit areas to obtain information  for my next report. We will remain in contact the rest of the  day.    [Contreras] Thank you very much Zanabria, and we await  further information.</p>

Because of the differences in design, the FGEIS recommended evaluating SFP expansions on a case-by-case basis. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For Pilgrim, the expansion of the storage capacity of the SFP will not create any significant additional radiological effects or nonradiological environmental impacts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The additional whole body dose that might be received by an individual at the site boundary and the estimated dose to the population within an 80 kilometer radius is believed to be too small to have any significance when compared to the fluctuations in the annual dose this population receives from exposure to background radiation. The occupational radiation dose for the proposed operation of the expanded SFP is estimated to be extremely small compared to the total annual occupational radiation exposure for this facility. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The only nonradiological impact affected by the SFP expansion is the waste heat rejected. The total increase in heat load rejected to the environment will be small in comparison to the amount of total heat currently being released. There is no significant environmental impact attributed to the waste heat from the plant due to this very small increase. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Finding of no Significant Impact <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The staff has reviewed the proposed SFP expansion to the facility relative to the requirements set forth in 10 CFR Part 51. Based on this assessment, the NRC staff concludes that there are no significant radiological or nonradiological impacts associated with the proposed action and that the issuance of the proposed amendment to the license will have no significant impact on the quality of the human environment. Therefore, pursuant to 10 CFR 51.31, no environmental impact statement needs to be prepared for this action. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For further details with respect to this action, see (1) the application for amendment to the TSs dated February 11, 1993, (2) the FGEIS on Handling and Storage of Spent Light Water Power Reactor Fuel (NUREG&hyph;0575), (3) the Final Environmental Statement for the Pilgrim Nuclear Power Station, dated May 1972, and (4) the Environmental Assessment dated June 15, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These documents are available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, and at the local public document room located at Plymouth Public Library, 11 North Street, Plymouth, Massachusetts 02360. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated at Rockville, Maryland, this 15th day of June 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Walter R.

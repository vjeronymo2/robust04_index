He believes, however, that "one private move does not  determine everything." Besides Gaydar and Ella Pamfilova, the  government must be quit by vice premiers Anatoly Chubays and  Boris Fedorov, because "they are responsible for the country's  ruin."    Zhebrovsky is convinced that resignation under such a far-  fetched pretext as disagreement with the decision to allocate  $500 Mn to the construction of a parliamentary center and to  unite the Russian and Belarusian monetary systems" attests to  the bankruptcy of the current policy. He thinks that for the  Russian economy $500 Mn is not the sum that determines success  or failure of a government program.</p>

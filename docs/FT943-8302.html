			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / Altman to resign from US Treasury post The Whitewater affair claimed its second prominent casualty in the Clinton administration yesterday when Mr Roger Altman decided to resign as deputy secretary of the Treasury. Ms Jean Hanson, Treasury legal counsel, was also reported to be leaving. Mr Altman had declined formal comment, in a morning public appearance, but a letter of resignation was said to be heading for President Bill Clinton and a formal announcement was expected later. This might include the nomination of a replacement, for which a leading Treasury candidate is Mr Frank Newman, now under-secretary for domestic finance. There was speculation that Mr Altman might also deliver a final strong defence of his conduct. His fate was effectively sealed last week when the two senior Democrats on the Senate finance committee - Mr Don Riegle, committee chairman from Michigan, and Mr Paul Sarbanes of Maryland - privately told both Mr Lloyd Bentsen, Treasury secretary, and Mr Lloyd Cutler, White House legal counsel, that Mr Altman had lost the confidence of Congress and should resign. Since then, White House officials have repeatedly qualified earlier statements of confidence in Mr Altman and said the final decision had to be his. Mr Bernard Nussbaum, former White House legal counsel, passed through much the same experience when he resigned his post four months ago. Mr Altman endured nine hours of brutal grilling by the committee on August 2 over the question of his knowledge of briefings by the Treasury to the White House on the status of investigations into the case of Madison Guaranty. This was the bankrupt Arkansas savings bank previously owned by a partner of the Clinton family in the Whitewater land development. He had been serving as acting head of the Resolution Trust Corporation, the agency responsible for cleaning up the US savings and loan debacle of the 1980s. Mr Altman repeatedly denied any interference with the investigatory processes and pointed out that he had been cleared of any ethical and criminal wrongdoing, both by Mr Robert Fiske, former Whitewater case special counsel, and by the non-partisan government ethics office. But additional controversy touched his delay in 'recusing' (disqualifying) himself from the Madison case because of his long friendship with the Clintons. He denied Republican charges that he had bowed to pressure over the case from Mr Nussbaum, in particular, but conceded that he should have followed his initial inclination to withdraw from anything to do with Madison. He also admitted that testimony to Congress last February on Madison was less full than it might have been, though he insisted he had not intentionally withheld any information.</p>

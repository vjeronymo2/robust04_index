			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / BA faces disruption as union calls 24 hour strike BRITISH AIRWAYS faces severe disruption worldwide from midnight tonight when its 17,000 cabin crew and ground staff will go on strike for 24 hours. In a surprise move last night, the Transport and General Workers' Union called its members out after talks yesterday failed to resolve a dispute over pay and conditions. The dispute arose after the introduction of new conditions for staff at Gatwick Airport following BA's takeover of Dan-Air last year. A union spokesman predicted the action would severely disrupt BA's operations worldwide. 'BA cannot get much off the ground without the T&amp;G,' he said. But BA later insisted that its fleet would not be grounded by the action. 'We expect to be able to operate well over half of our intercontinental services and a considerable number of our European and domestic services in the event of strike action,' the company said. Mr Bill Morris, the TGWU general secretary, said: 'British Airways have failed to address the basic concerns of our members over the contracting out of services and the transferring of work to newly-created subsidiary companies. 'These policies have undermined job security for BA employees, which is why our members have voted clearly for strike action in a secret ballot. 'I regret that BA have failed to respond to our efforts to seek a settlement to this dispute.' The talks had been adjourned with BA management hoping for a meeting with Mr Morris to try to resolve the dispute. BA said last night that the strike would be 'wholly unwarranted' but added that the company was still hopeful the strike could be averted. The result of a ballot of 3,000 BA pilots - members of the British Air Line Pilots' Association - on industrial action over what they claim is an attempt to introduce poorer pay and conditions should be announced tomorrow.</p>

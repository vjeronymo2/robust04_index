			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / Drinks makers face legal case soon SOME OF the UK's leading manufacturers of baby foods are about to face legal action over the sugar content of children's drinks in one of the largest multi-party compensation claims filed in Britain, Tim Burt writes. A High Court judge is expected to start considering the case against SmithKline Beecham, Boots, Cow and Gate, Milupa and Robinsons soon, following legal submissions by solicitors representing more than 700 families. The claims allege that the products were defective and that the companies acted negligently in failing to print labels warning of high sugar content in drinks for babies. Solicitors acting for the families say the drinks rotted children's teeth, forcing many to undergo remedial surgery. The drinks, they claim, were a factor in the increasing incidence of 'nursing bottle caries', a jawbone infection which makes teeth blacken and decay as they emerge. Potential damages could run into millions of pounds, according to solicitors who warned that the number of family claimants could exceed 1,000 by the time initial court hearings started. The companies yesterday denied legal liability for infants' dental problems and pledged to contest the action.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Hong Kong, May 5 (XINHUA) -- The political affairs  panel for the Preliminary Working Committee for Hong Kong  Special Administrative Region (SAR) today held talks with  representatives from the Democratic Alliance for Betterment of  Hong Kong and Hong Kong Progressive Alliance.    The panel listened to their opinions and suggestions on the  current political structure in Hong Kong and on the work of the  committee.    Xiao Weiyun, head of the Chinese (mainland) side at the  panel, told the press after the talks that the panel will make  in-depth study of their opinions and suggestions.    He noted that the current three-tier political structure in  Hong Kong will be terminated and re-organized after July 1,  1997. These are two different matters and there is no way that  one tier needs re-organization while two others need not, he  said.    He said the SAR government and the first SAR Legislative  Council will be set up after 1997 according to the Basic Law and  relevant regulations of the Chinese National People's Congress  so as to ensure a smooth transfer of power and maintain social  stability and economic prosperity in Hong Kong.    "It is just in line with this spirit that our panel is  holding discussions on various kinds of work," Xiao said.    Although the Sino-British talks on the political structure  have broke down, Xiao said, the Chinese side hopes to continue  cooperation with Britain in the fields of economy, culture and  education.    He stressed that the guarantee for the smooth transition and  maintenance of prosperity and stability is the Basic Law and  Hong Kong residents' wish for such a transition.    Xiao said his panel will strive to implement the spirit of  the Basic Law.    The two political organizations wished the preliminary  committee strengthen communication with Hong Kong residents,  Xiao said.    "We deem this opinion is right and will hand it over to the  committee for discussion," he added.</p>

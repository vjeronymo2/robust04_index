			<p><P> August 17, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DESERT  </P> <P> This letter is in response to your editorial "Split Allegiances" (Aug. 2).  </P> <P> In my opinion, the Bureau of Land Management has done a good job on limited  funds managing our vast desert areas. It is not easy to administer the diverse  needs of mining, grazing, recreation, ecosystem protection, etc.  </P> <P> Perhaps the real question is whether we want to use our desert resources  responsibly or simply close large areas to all but the fortunate few, strong  enough to put on a backpack and trek into an environment that can vary 50  degrees in an 8-hour period.  </P> <P> Rather than have the National Park Service, with limited desert experience,  take over, give the experienced BLM the necessary funding to better administer  this precious resource.  </P> <P> JOHN GAWLEY  </P> <P> Alhambra  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 1, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NORTH TRIAL JUDGE REFUSES TO COMPEL REAGAN TO TESTIFY  </P> <P> Rejecting efforts to compel Ronald Reagan to appear as a witness in the  Iran-Contra trial, a federal judge ruled Friday that defendant Oliver L. North  "has wholly failed" to show why he needs the former President's testimony.  </P> <P> In a later action, U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell also denied North's  motions to dismiss charges in the case, leaving North to begin his defense  Monday against 12 felony counts in the case.  </P> <P> North's lawyers, who had wanted to make Reagan their first witness, have  estimated that they will complete their arguments in three to nine days, but it  is not clear what effect the judge's ruling will have on that timetable.  </P> <P> Gesell's ruling on a Reagan trial appearance represents a severe setback for  the defense. It had centered its case on the assertion that North, a former  National Security Council aide, had the blessings of his superiors when he  helped engineer the scheme that sold arms to Iran and diverted part of the  profits to the rebels in Nicaragua, while misleading Congress about the  Administration's Contra support activities.  </P> <P> In quashing the defense subpoena of Reagan, the judge said: "While there is  understandable public interest in what a President may have known or may have  done, the focus of North's trial does not involve any necessity for such a  generalized inquiry."  </P> <P> Both the Justice Department and Reagan's personal attorney had argued  strenuously against requiring the former President's testimony, citing  executive privilege and the danger of having national security secrets exposed  on the witness stand.  </P> <P> Reagan, in a television interview in Rancho Mirage, Calif., said that he  adamantly opposed testifying at the trial. "I made up my mind I wasn't going,"  Reagan said. "I think it would have set a precedent that the next President  doesn't have a right to impose on other Presidents. No President has ever been  subpoenaed."  </P> <P> On Jan. 27, Gesell declared that he had "the naked power" to force both Reagan  and President Bush to testify. And some legal sources close to both sides of  the case believed that North's attorneys, in recent cross-examination of key  prosecution witnesses, had established stronger grounds for compelling Reagan's  appearance.  </P> <P> In his five-page ruling Friday, however, Gesell said he had concluded that the  core contention by the defense that North was following implicit presidential  orders was not sufficient to require Reagan to address the issue personally in  court.  </P> <P> "Whether or not authorization is a defense, authorization is not established by  atmosphere, surmise or inference," he said. ". . .The trial record presently  contains no proof that defendant North ever received any authorization from  President Reagan to engage in the illegal conduct alleged, either directly or  indirectly, orally or in writing."  </P> <P> Gesell's ruling did not mention whether he would allow any other form of  testimony from Reagan. He had been considering whether to have Reagan submit  written answers to questions or whether to videotape his testimony.  </P> <P> The judge also had considered allowing parts of Reagan's diary to be admitted  as evidence. But he said in his order that he has read "references . . . to  portions" of the diary and concluded that "nothing there remotely supports an  authorization claim."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'No Evidence'  </P> <P> During about an hour of arguments over whether to dismiss the charges against  North, his attorney, Barry Simon, asserted that there is "no evidence" that  North had obstructed investigations of the Iran-Contra affair and there was "no  basis" for the jury to conclude that the former Marine had lied.  </P> <P> The motions were dismissed by Gesell, who said: "The court is satisfied that  all 12 counts must go to the jury at this stage."  </P> <P> The charges against North allege that he lied to Congress and obstructed  inquiries into the scandal, which came to light in November, 1986. He is  charged with destroying official documents, defrauding the government and  illegally accepting a $13,800 security system at his suburban Virginia home. If  convicted, North faces a maximum of 60 years in prison and $3 million in fines.  </P></p>

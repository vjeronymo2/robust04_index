			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / Survey of Canada (11): US investment rises sharply - Laurie Morse on the impact of multinationals on trade Foreign investment in Canada has begun to swing up again, bolstered by exchange rate advantages, new trade agreements that will open more international markets to products made in Canada and a healthy recovery in the US economy. Nearly 45 per cent of Canada's manufacturing output was exported to the US last year, making the economic health of Canada's huge southern neighbour an inescapable consideration when it comes to investment. Canada is currently running a Dollars 12bn international trade surplus, and is in the midst of an export-led economic recovery. Companies wishing to broaden their presence in North America are increasingly turning to Canada for specialised manufacturing operations, capitalising on the benefits of a cheap currency, a highly-educated workforce, good labour relations and proximity to the largest consumer market in the world. These factors for many companies offset the negative influences of high taxes and the risks associated with the threat of a political split between Canada and francophone Quebec. A survey of current business conditions published in March by the US Commerce Depart- ment described Canada as one of the biggest beneficiaries of a Dollars 5.3bn, or 8 per cent, worldwide increase in investment planned by US companies in their affiliates abroad in 1994. Canada will receive a full Dollars 1.3bn of the increase, second only to investments planned for affiliates of US companies located in Asia and the Pacific. US companies plan to spend Dollars 8.7bn in improving or adding to their Canadian operations this year, the highest since 1990, and a 16 per cent increase over 1993. The jump in US investment follows a difficult restructuring period in Canada, which saw a number of multinational companies rationalise operations and streamline marketing and manufacturing strategies. 'What's happened here over the last 15 years is that there has been a greater degree of specialisation,' says Mr Jason Myers, chief economist for the Canadian Manufacturers' Association. 'Ten years ago, a multinational company would have manufactured 10 or 12 products in Canada and imported several others. Now, the same company will produce one or two products in Canada, but will do it on a large scale for worldwide distribution.' This consol- idation, he says, has forced the small Canadian suppliers to rationalise as well. The new interest in multinational investment in Canada, then, is more to expand and modernise existing operations than to open new facilities. Merger and acquisition of Canadian companies by foreigners has remained relatively stable over the past two years, representing about Dollars 5bn, with US, UK and Hong Kong interests making the largest deals in 1993, according to global investment statistics complied by KPMG Peat Marwick. Three industries are seeing the bulk of the new capital infusion - oil and gas; vehicles and transportation equipment, and mining. In vehicles, a recent surge in North American car demand has caused Ford to invest about Dollars 3bn at its Canadian plants in the past two years, and Chrysler another Dollars 2bn, according to Mr Slawek Skorupinski, director-general of the automotive section at Canada's Department of Industry. Eighty per cent of cars produced in Canada are exported. Ford and Chrysler are adding third shifts to their Canadian plants to meet surging demand. All the big three car manufacturers have modernised their factories in Canada and are launching products, according to Mr Skorupinski. Ford, for example, has retooled its old Tempo Topaz plant in Oakville, Ontario to be the sole producer of its new family mini-van, which is expected to compete with Chrysler's popular Voyager model. US-owned carmakers will together increase their investment by 53 per cent, or Dollars 1.7bn, in Canada in 1994, a boost that looks particularly strong considering it follows a 42 per cent increase in 1993. However, not all vehicle manufacturers are sharing equally in the rise in demand for new cars. Hyundai recently shut a Quebec plant that had been producing its Elantra model, leaving 700 people without jobs. Hyundai's problem, Mr Skorupinski says, is that it was not successful in generating demand in the North American market. Canada's western provinces have been thriving on expansion in the energy industry. In 1992, Canada's federal government revised its regulations regarding foreign investment for oil and gas exploration and development, putting foreigners on an equal footing with Canadian companies and opening up the industry to outside capital. With exploration success rates in Canada averaging about 50 per cent, compared with about 25 per cent in the US, multinational oil companies have expanded their operations here. Eastern provinces are not entirely left out of this movement. Several US oil companies will plough about Dollars 2.5bn into their Canadian operations this year to develop crude oil reserves off the coast of Newfoundland. Natural gas investments are also on the rise. Existing North American natural gas pipelines are currently operating at high load factors, making several expansion projects necessary. With Mexico's entry into the North American energy grid, Canadian companies will produce and export related equipment as the US develops the Mexican market.</p>

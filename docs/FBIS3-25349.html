Today the  United Nations and the troika of observers presented a new  document on national reconciliation to the sides. The contents  of the document are not known, but it is known that it is the  result of points of view presented by the National Union for the  Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] and the government.    The two sides held meetings with the mediators this morning  and once again this afternoon. Although no diplomat has made  statements to the press, the countenance of the negotiators was  described as encouraging. Observers have said the issue of  national reconciliation in Angola, a country at war for more  than 30 years, is not an ease issue to deal with. However, UN  Special Representative Alioune Blondin Beye still believes in a  solution for this delicate point. UNITA also believes in this  and hopes that Luanda, which has not yet made concessions, may  do so to achieve peace and democracy in Angola. Thus, the ball  is on the side of the Popular Movement for the Liberation of  Angola-Labor Party.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] A convention of citizens of Serb nationality  ended in Sarajevo today with the adoption of a declaration  expressing the firm will of the Serb people living in the free  part of Bosnia-Herzegovina to live in peace in a single  Bosnia-Herzegovina within its internationally recognized  borders. [passage omitted]    In its declaration, the convention stresses that no  political  goals can justify the suffering of innocent population, genocide  and ethnic cleansing, particularly suffered by the Bosniak  people. It stresses that the future of Bosnia-Herzegovina lies  in its independence and sovereignty within the internationally  recognized borders. Both the declaration and the proclamation  on the convocation of a convention of trust energetically urge  the strictest punishment by the international tribunal of all  war criminals. The convocation of the convention of trust  itself is necessary because interethnic trust will not be  restored easily and quickly, while the convention can contribute  to this hard and painstaking process. [passage omitted]    Let us just add in conclusion that the convention of the  citizens of Serb nationality ended with the election of the Serb  Civic Forum [Srpski gradjanski forum]. Mirko Pejanovic was  elected president of the 32-member forum.</p>

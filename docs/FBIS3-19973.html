			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Association of Organizations From Kurdistan  (KOMKAR) has disassociated itself from the violence committed by  Kurdish demonstrators in Germany. While these acts may achieve  welcome effects for the media, they by no means bring about the  solidarity the Kurds want, the association said in Bonn on  Wednesday [23 March]. KOMKAR is not associated with the Workers  Party of Kurdistan (PKK), which has been banned in Germany.  However, the association spoke out against deporting the  perpetrators to Turkey: They would fall "directly into the hands  of the torturers and executioners."</p>

			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Retail growth helps BAA to Pounds 111m in first quarter Rapidly increasing retail income helped BAA turn in an 11 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 111m for the first quarter to June 30. Turnover rose 5 per cent from Pounds 291m to Pounds 305m. The largest increase came from retail revenue, up 8.5 per cent at Pounds 125m, in spite of the ongoing programme of redeveloping terminal facilities. The company has completed the extension of the retail areas at Terminals 3 and 4 at Heathrow, where double digit increases were achieved. It is now implementing a rolling expansion programme which will provide it with 900,000 sq ft of retail space by 1997. It currently has 600,000 sq ft of shopping space. Passenger numbers grew by 6 per cent to 22.1m during the quarter, and the company, which operates seven UK airports, is predicting that traffic growth will be maintained at between 5 and 6 per cent for the current year. In the most recent set of statistics, for June, growth in passenger throughput had accelerated to 9 per cent. Sir John Egan, chief executive, said: 'Our strategy of developing the core business, building revenue and controlling costs has enabled us to capitalise on this growth and this confirms our confidence in the prospects for the next nine months and beyond.' He said Gatwick had recorded its strongest growth for three years, due to increasing charter traffic. Revenues from airport charges rose 5.6 per cent to Pounds 117m, while airport property income improved 11 per cent to Pounds 40m (Pounds 36m), as new facilities came on stream. Capital expenditure increased by 73 per cent to Pounds 88m, reflecting the Pounds 1.4bn spending programme announced earlier this year. This included a substantial increase in spending on the Pounds 300m Heathrow Express, the high speed rail link to London's Paddington station due for completion in 1997. Earnings per share were 8p (7.2p). The share price fell 20p to 953p on profit taking, but analysts maintained their full year forecasts, with expectations of about Pounds 370m for the year to end-March.</p>

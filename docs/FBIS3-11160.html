The mission, which resumed its activities on  31 January, is currently investigating 21 cases of extrajudicial  executions and of suspicious deaths that occurred in the capital  during the first 15 days of March. Sixteen of those victims were  from the slum neighborhood of Cite Soleil. The victims include a  student, Mesilia Mesadieux, who was murdered in Delmas 19, and  Dady Pierre, who was killed in Cite Soleil. In the latter case,  the mission quotes witnesses who saw military personnel and two  armed civilians.    Furthermore, the mission counted 50 cases of murder between  31 January and 28 February. The victims include 12 members of  grassroots organizations and an Army officer killed in  Carrefour-Feuilles.    In concluding its report, the UN/OAS international civilian  mission condemned the growing number of extrajudicial executions  and suspicious deaths, and has asked the Haitian Armed Forces to  take measures to end this cycle of violence. The assessment  made by the Port-au-Prince police should also be pointed out:  883 people were arrested for various reasons during the month of  February. Two hundred thirteen of the detained were released,  and 424 were referred to the court.</p>

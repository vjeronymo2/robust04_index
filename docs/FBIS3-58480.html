He admitted that he once raised the possibility  of his own retirement, and that that was a mistake which  subsequently fueled the internal crisis in the party.    Felipe Gonzalez also stated that at the next PSOE congress,  if he has the confidence of the delegates and it depends on him,  Alfonso Guerra will figure in the new party leadership. In a  conversation with journalists, Gonzalez admitted that the  precongress debate in the PSOE has become heated, and that he is  trying to stay neutral in the process of selecting delegates.  He described as liars those who could have said he is opposed  to Guerra's presence in the new leadership that will emerge from  the congress, and emphasized his belief that Alfonso Guerra can  remain a perfect PSOE deputy secretary general. [passage  omitted]    On a possible coalition government following the Socialist  congress, Gonzalez said there is cooperation with CiU  [Convergence and Union], which makes it possible to govern and  to adopt measures as important as the labor reform. He repeated  his offer of a coalition government, and said he is open to  dialogue if CiU were to accept the offer. He admitted, however,  that communication with the Basque Nationalist Party would be  much more difficult now, although he declined to give an  explanation of what he believes to be the cause of the Basque  Nationalists' change of attitude. Gonzalez did rule out a grand  coalition government with the People's Party, because he  believes the conditions for it do not exist.    Nor did he show himself in favor of holding an early  election, although the latest opinion polls to be published show  an increase for the People's Party. He recalled that something  similar occurred last May, but the PSOE then won the election.  With respect to the People's Party, Gonzalez admitted meeting  recently with Jose Maria Aznar to discuss the situation in  Banesto [company in financial crisis] and the NATO summit. He  expressed his desire to continue to hold these personal  contacts, although he admitted there have only been two in the  course of the parliamentary term.    Gonzalez also denied that he lives shut up in Moncloa Palace  and has no contact with people, although he acknowledged that he  could be giving the false impression of living isolated from the  country's real problems. [passage omitted]    The prime minister also criticized the attitude of the trade  unions to calling a general strike for 27 January. In the  opinion of Felipe Gonzalez, this is a totally inopportune act  of irresponsibility, since it will not help to create jobs or to  boost investors' confidence, and he repeated that it is bad for  the already difficult economic situation suffered by Spain. The  Spanish head of government also showed moderate optimism about  an early emergence from the crisis, in view of the improvement  in the latest economic indicators. However, he forecast a slow  recovery which would have no immediate impact on job creation.  [passage omitted]</p>

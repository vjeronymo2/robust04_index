			<p>BFN     [Text] Shanghai, April 25 (XINHUA) -- The Chang Jiang  Valley has become China's most concentrated region for the auto  industry.    In 1993 the Chinese mainland produced 1.31 million  automobiles, including 300,000 sedans. One-third of that number  was manufactured by plants in Shanghai and Jiangsu, Hubei,  Jiangxi and Sichuan Provinces.    Shanghai Volkswagen, a Sino-German joint-venture, the  Nanjing  General Automobile Plant, a Sino-Italian joint-venture, and the  state-owned Yangzhou General Bus Plant have become the main  producers of sedans, trucks and buses.    Shanghai Volkswagen turned out 100,000 "Santana" sedans last  year.    Auto production is now the mainstay industry in Shanghai,  Jiangsu, Hubei, Jiangxi and Sichuan.    Many of these factories have enjoyed good economic returns  in  recent years, with profits exceeding 100 million yuan each.    The development of the technology-intensive auto industry  has  boosted the growth of related support businesses. Shanghai  Volkswagen has 200 factories making parts for it which are  involved in a dozen industrial sectors and are scattered along  the Chang Jiang or in nearby areas.    Now 80 percent of the parts on a Santana sedan are made in  these support factories.    Shanghai Volkswagen is expected to roll 200,000 Santanas off  the line this year, double last year's figure.    The central government has placed priority on the auto  industry and is determined to support its development for a long  time to come.    Last year the output value of the 116 auto manufacturers on  the mainland accounted for about three percent of the gross  industrial output value in the country.    However, Vice-Premier Li Lanqing said recently that "China's  light-duty auto industry, due to its low technology and  productivity, still has a long way to go before becoming a  full- fledged producer."    Overseas auto corporations have realized the needs and  potential of the Chinese market and are pouring hefty investment  into the domestic manufacturers along the Chang Jiang.    The French Renault auto company has invested 100 million  U.S.  dollars jointly with a local partner in Hubei to produce  mini-vans. The project is expected to start production this  September and make 40,000 mini-vans annually.    Most of the Sino-foreign joint ventures have decided to  increase production or develop new models.    Overseas auto parts makers are also trying to gain a  foothold  in China. A company from the United States has invested 160  million U.S. dollars to set up 15 auto parts manufacturers.    Experts here said that since the auto industry involves many  other industries, the rapid expansion of Sino-foreign joint  ventures and state-owned auto plants is bound to edge out those  smaller, less competitive local counterparts.</p>

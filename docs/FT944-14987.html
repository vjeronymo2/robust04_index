			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / UK Company News: DFS beats flotation targets with 14% rise DFS Furniture, which makes and sells upholstered furniture, lifted both annual profits and sales to record levels. But at yesterday's close the share price remained below last year's flotation price of 260p, even after a 3p gain to 259p - a market value of Pounds 270m. Mr Graham Kirkham, chairman, said yesterday that the results had exceeded the targets set at flotation and represented a 25-year history of increased profits. They confirmed the company's position as the 'leading specialist in upholstered furniture in the UK'. Pre-tax profits for the year to the end of July, excluding exceptionals and property disposals, increased by just over 14 per cent to Pounds 22.7m, compared with Pounds 19.9m in the previous 53 weeks. Sales were 18 per cent ahead at Pounds 134.9m (Pounds 114.2m). Operating margins were almost unchanged at 16.2 per cent. Net cash increased from Pounds 16.1m to Pounds 26.8m. Mr Chris Ferris, finance director, said expansion plans would be met from operating cash flow. 'We have never borrowed and in view of the cash generation there is no need to do so,' he said. While admitting that its cash pile is large, DFS believes it would not take many freehold retail opportunities to bring it down quickly. The group, which now employs a workforce of 680, opened three branches last year, taking the total to 29. It is planning to open in Swindon this year, and to add a further four outlets in 1995-96. Capital expenditure this year is expected to remain steady at Pounds 6.9m. Net interest receivable fell from Pounds 1.3m to Pounds 886,000. Exceptional charges of Pounds 1.36m related to the costs of the flotation. In the previous year there was a charge of Pounds 13.4m for one-off payments to directors and pension contributions. Earnings per share grew to 14.39p (13.02p). A final dividend of 4.9p is proposed, taking the total for the year to 7.2p, against 6.4p. COMMENT The retreat of the shares from the year's high of 354p in January looks like the result of disappointment at the rise in interest rates, lower durable goods sales and the continuing weak housing market. Even so, the DFS management has delivered everything it promised at the flotation, performing well in a difficult year. Its approach is inherently conservative: it likes freehold properties paid for out of strong cash flow. The in-house manufacture of 15 per cent of its sales puts it in a strong position when dealing with other suppliers. Expansion plans are constrained mainly by the difficulty of finding and training the right staff - with only 7 per cent of a fragmented market there is plenty to play for. Estimated profits of Pounds 26m this year - a prospective p/e of 15.7 - leave it at a slight premium to the sector, which seems fair enough for a retailer with a strong format and plenty of room to grow.</p>

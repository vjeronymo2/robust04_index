At the  conference of heads of ROK overseas missions on 2 February,  Minister Han Sung-chu said it is his view that North Korea's  attempt to delay, whether for one or two months or for a half a  year, will not help to promote its nuclear development  capability and nuclear development activities.    Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu's remarks urging composure are  noteworthy because it is made at a time when the possibility of  referring the North Korean nuclear issue to the United Nations  is increasing.</p>

			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / Councils braced for hard talks on finance Local authorities today meet Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, saying they are braced for the 'toughest finance settlement they have ever faced'. They say councils had to draw on reserves to meet last year's government-imposed pay rise of 2.9 per cent for their staff, and that extra responsibilities placed on them over the last year will cost Pounds 1.6bn to implement. The squeeze on local authority budgets is worsened by a fall in the revenue generated by national non-domestic rates, paid by businesses. When these rates were introduced in 1990-91, they raised Pounds 10.4bn, which rose to Pounds 12.4bn the following year. But they have fallen every year since then, and are Pounds 10.7bn, for 1994-95 - a fall mainly due to initial overvaluations and to properties being left empty during the recession. Local authorities believe this shortfall could affect the funds available for this year. The associations of county councils, district councils and metropolitan authorities, all of which are Labour-led, said that an extra Pounds 1.6bn, excluding inflation, was needed to meet several increased service requirements, including: Pounds 400m arising from legislation including the Children Act, the Criminal Justice Act and the Police and Magistrates Court Act. Pounds 600m for demand-led changes, including rising numbers of school pupils and elderly, infrastructure costs, and social and structural changes, including an extra Pounds 150m in mandatory rent allowances. Pounds 300m to respond to other government-led initiatives such as improved safety standards for school transport, limits on class sizes, and training for social services staff. Pounds 200m for care in the community. Mr Gummer must decide how to buffer the impact of the change in the formula for allocating grants to local government, which was introduced this year. This sharply reduced grants to 18 central London authorities. Last year authorities which lost funds received 'damping' grants from the govern-ment to limit council tax rises. The Labour-controlled Association of London Authorities said council tax bills would rise by an average 25 per cent in those boroughs if all these grants were removed next year. A survey by Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the accountants, suggested that this would mean an extra Pounds 133 a year for a typical household. This could be avoided by slashing Pounds 180m from authority budgets. Coopers &amp; Lybrand recommended that the damping grant should be withdrawn progressively over three to four years.</p>

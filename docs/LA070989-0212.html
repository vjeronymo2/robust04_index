			<p><P> July 9, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 1,000 TAKE PART IN CONFRONTATION AT ABORTION CLINIC  </P> <P> Nearly 1,000 anti-abortion activists and pro-choice advocates taunted one  another, set up rival picket lines and formed human blockades around a Tustin  medical clinic on Saturday in one of several demonstrations staged nationwide  after the Supreme Court handed down a controversial abortion ruling.  </P> <P> The boisterous demonstration outside the Doctors' Family Planning facility in  the Santa Ana-Tustin Medical Pavilion was the first in Southern California  since the Supreme Court decided Monday that states can restrict abortions if  they choose.  </P> <P> Buoyed by the ruling, members of Operation Rescue, a militant anti-abortion  group, had hoped to block the entrances of the facility where abortions are  performed.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Opponents Were Waiting  </P> <P> But when anti-abortion demonstrators arrived early Saturday, they were met by  pro-choice activists who quickly locked arms and formed a wall of bodies  intended to shield patients and keep the facility open.  </P> <P> "There were no arrests made because there were no complaints from the clinic,"  said Capt. Steve Foster of the Tustin Police Department. "The clinic remained  open, and patients were being seen."  </P> <P> Operation Rescue officials disputed that contention, and one woman who  identified herself as a clinic employee told anti-abortion demonstrators that a  number of appointments had been rescheduled Saturday and that no abortions were  performed.  </P> <P> But Judi Larson, executive director of the Doctors' Family Planning Medical  Group Inc., insisted that the majority of patients were seen as scheduled.  "Several patients chose to terminate their pregnancies this morning, and that  was done," she said.  </P> <P> Overall, the Tustin demonstration was largely nonviolent, although tempers  flared and a few people reported minor injuries from shoving matches. Previous  demonstrations this year in Southern California resulted in hundreds of  arrests. Officers who arrived from several Orange County communities prepared  for an unruly crowd spent the day merely watching both sides wage a battle of  songs, chants, protest signs and prayers.  </P> <P> Afterward, each group declared it was the victor.  </P> <P> "We feel that we accomplished our goals to rescue babies that were immediately  in danger," said Elaine Bingham, an Operation Rescue spokeswoman.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Councilman Attends  </P> <P> Councilman Earl J. Prescott, one of two Tustin City Council members who had  earlier expressed opposition to the clinic, praised the demonstrators for  choosing the clinic as a target. "Thanks for coming to Tustin," he said. "There  was no killing over there today."  </P> <P> Pro-choice advocates were equally elated about the hours-long standoff.  </P> <P> "I am absolutely thrilled," said Margie Seigle, executive director of Planned  Parenthood of Orange and San Bernardino counties. "I think we have stated that  Orange County is pro-choice and we will not tolerate the lawlessness of  Operation Rescue."  </P> <P> And after the demonstrations, Robin Schneider, executive director of the  California Abortion Rights Action League South, told cheering supporters: "We  confronted them today, and we beat them. And not only did we beat them, we beat  them with style."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Latest Skirmish  </P> <P> The clash between the two groups was the latest in a series of skirmishes that  began in February when Operation Rescue first appeared in Southern California  to carry out part of its nationwide campaign to shut down abortion clinics. It  was also one of the most peaceful for a day that saw demonstrations scattered  nationwide from Brookline, Mass., to Denver.  </P> <P> No one was arrested in Brookline, but police reported 61 arrests in Chicago, 58  in Milwaukee, 50 in Denver, 41 in Dallas and 27 in Miami. Most of the arrests  involved people who attempted to block entrances to buildings where abortions  are performed.  </P> <P> Abortion clinics and police had braced themselves for another round of  demonstrations this weekend after the U. S. Supreme Court on Monday upheld a  Missouri law that forbids abortions in public hospitals and bans public  employees from assisting abortions in any way.  </P> <P> Although the justices did not overturn the landmark 1973 Roe vs. Wade ruling  that legalized abortion, their ruling marked a departure from the court's  long-established practice of striking down nearly all state restrictions on  abortions.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Mary Lou Fulton contributed to this story.  </P></p>

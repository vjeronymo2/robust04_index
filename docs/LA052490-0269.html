			<p><P> May 24, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> ENGLAND TO HOST '93 RYDER CUP  </P> <P> The European Ryder Cup Committee spurned a strong bid by Spain and voted today  to stage the 1993 Ryder Cup golf match against the United States at The Belfry  in central England for the third time.  </P> <P> Spain will stage the event the next time it is held in Europe in 1997 "subject  to certain guarantees and contractual arrangements being forthcoming," the  committee said.  </P> <P> The decision boiled down to a straight fight between The Belfry, the choice of  the European Professional Golfers Assn., and the Club de Campo in Madrid,  favored by the PGA European Tour.  </P> <P> The issue was decided on a vote cast by Lord Derby, chairman of the Ryder Cup  Committee.  </P> <P> The Belfry, at Sutton Coldfield in the English Midlands, staged the event for  the first time in 1985, when Europe wrested the trophy from the United States.  Europe, which won for the second straight time in 1987 in the United States,  retained the cup after last year's tie.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The new Bosnia contact group -- which is designed to  put political "punch" into the quest for a peace settlement --  is to visit the battle zones soon for urgent discussions with  the warring parties.    This was decided at the first meeting of the group at the  Foreign Office in London today. It comprises representatives of  Russia, the United States, the European Union [EU] and the  United Nations.    After the meeting a spokesman said: "They agreed their  priority was to try to restore the momentum of the peace  process. They will explore urgently the prospects for a  cessation of hostilities and engaging the parties in  negotiations about a settlement.    ``Their work will be conducted within the framework given by  the EU and UN and the group will travel to Bosnia shortly for  discussions with the parties,'' the spokesman added.</p>

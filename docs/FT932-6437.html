			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / Technology: A new look at IT Anyone who follows the information technology business in Europe knows how complex, contradictory and statistically challenging it can be. In an enterprising attempt to bring together all the important data about European computer and telecommunications hardware, software and services, the European Commission, in conjunction with the manufacturers' organisation, Eurobit and the trade fairs CeBIT Hanover, SIMO Madrid and SMAU Milan, have collated the European Information Technology Observatory 1993*, 275 pages of trends, views and figures. The introductory view from the commission is by Michel Carpentier, the EC director general with responsibility for IT, who argues for a long-term plan of industrial objectives which could be met through a simplified and enlightened approach to research and development. Bruno Lamborghini of Olivetti, president of Eurobit, gives an industry view, arguing for open markets and fair treatment: 'The IT market should be a truly global endeavour' he writes, 'characterised by a high level of international labour mobility. Therefore the IT industry must have unlimited access under fair trade conditions to any market. Subsidies do not improve competitiveness.' Analysing the present state of the European market, the Observatory concludes that although the immediate future may not look bright, there is enormous potential. There is instability and discontinuity because of the economic recession and fierce price competition. On the other hand, the European market has an advantage over the US because it is less saturated: 'This means that Europe can enjoy a significantly higher growth rate over the next 10 years before it reaches a level of saturation similar to that of the US. This is an opportunity not to be missed by the European IT industry and European entrepreneurs.' *EITO care of EuroBIT, Lyoner Strasse 18, D-6000 Frankfurt/M71 Telephone (49) 69 6603 510.</p>

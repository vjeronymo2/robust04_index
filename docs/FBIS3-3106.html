After Japan,  Australia, and Canada had done so, the United States and the EU  expressed their support for China's resuming GATT status. In  other words, China has broken through important obstacles to  reenter the GATT. If a basic agreement can be reached at the  "16th Session of the GATT Working Party on China," which will be  held in Geneva in mid-March, there will be more hope for China  to resume GATT status.    China was an original GATT signatory in 1948. In 1949, the  People's Republic of China was founded. Logically, it should  have been entitled to continue GATT membership. However, the  Kuomintang authorities, which had retreated to Taiwan, announced  their withdrawal from GATT in March 1950. Since then, China's  seat has been vacant. It was not until July 1986 that China  formally asked to restore its GATT signatory status. But the  light of China's return to GATT has appeared only after  eight-odd years of marathon-like negotiations, during which all  sorts of obstacles have been encountered.    The main obstacles to China's readmission to GATT have come  from the United States. In 1989, the United States set a number  of conditions on China's resumption of GATT status. These  include: 1) increasing the transparency of economic information  and trade regulations; 2) unifying the country's foreign trade  policy and abolishing export subsidies; 3) formulating social  insurance clauses and working out a minimum wage system for  staff members and workers; 4) reducing tariffs on thousands of  commodity categories; and 5) abolishing nontariff measures, such  as quota certificates and so on. Last year the United States set  new conditions on China, demanding that the renminbi correspond  with free exchange rate standards, prohibiting the use of  fluctuating exchange rates as a means of trade protection, and  demanding the abolition of cities with separate listing and  preferential policies, the uniformity of taxation laws, and the  opening of its services market to the outside world. The EU has  basically followed the United States and asked China to abide by  these conditions.    Due to different social and economic systems, China, of  course, finds it difficult to completely follow these U.S. and  European economic measures. As a matter of fact, most of the  100-odd GATT members do not comply with the above conditions,  and the United States itself has built trade barriers and  practices a quota system. However, following the in-depth  development of reform and opening up, many aspects of China's  economic structure have gradually converged with the  international economic structure. To expand foreign trade and  strive for an early resumption of GATT status, the mainland  twice reduced the import tariffs on some 2,800 categories of  commodities last year, including raw materials and machinery.  In addition, it took the initiative to announce a list of  tariff reductions for agricultural products and a list of tariff  reductions on service trades. Although tariff reductions on  nonagricultural products has not reached the required 30  percent, China has expressed its readiness to meet these before  reentering GATT.    Moreover, to meet the actual needs of GATT reentry, China  unified its official renminbi exchange rate and the regulatory  foreign exchange market exchange rate on 1 January this year.  This year, it will also relax foreign exchange controls over  trade and allow foreign-funded banks to deal in foreign exchange  and provide renminbi loans to create adequate conditions for  completely free renminbi exchange rates in the years to come.    Apart from these, this year China will implement a new  unified taxation system throughout the country, abolish  preferential policies for eight cities with separate listings  [in State plans], open its retail market to the outside world,  and partly open its telecommunications market and civil aviation  market. In many aspects, China has met the conditions for  readmission to GATT.    Viewing these major concessions by China, we believe that it  will make every possible effort to resume GATT status this year.  According to the provisions of the Uruguay Round document of  December last year, a new GATT agreement will be signed in  January 1995, during which the old organization will be  dissolved and a new one--the World Trade  Organization--established; signatory nations will automatically  become members. If China cannot reenter GATT before the signing  of the new agreement, it will spend a lot of effort again in  applying for admission to the new organization. Therefore, this  is a crucial year for China to resume its GATT status.    During a visit to China in late February, U.S. Assistant  Trade Representative Dorothy Dwoskin joined the eighth round of  bilateral talks on China resuming GATT status. After the talks,  Wu Yi, China's minister of foreign trade and economic  cooperation, told Dwoskin that China had demonstrated its  flexibility on conditions for resuming GATT status. Dwoskin  spoke highly of China's recent economic and trade reform  measures, particularly the unification of the renminbi exchange  rates, adding explicitly: "The United States firmly supports  China's resumption of GATT status." EU Commissioner Leon  Brittan came to China after Dwoskin's visit. Despite  differences during a meeting with Minister Wu Yi on whether or  not the Hong Kong issue will affect Sino-British economic and  trade relations, Brittan indicated affirmatively after the  meeting that "China can join GATT this year."</p>

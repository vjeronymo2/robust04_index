			<p><P> October 25, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WORLD IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> FAR EAST;  </P> <P> LAWMAKERS OK CUTS IN ASIAN BASE FUNDS  </P> <P> House and Senate negotiators agreed on an $8.5-billion military construction  bill that would slash President Bush's requests for bases in South Korea and  the Philippines. Concerned that the United States carries too big a share of  the defense burden, the lawmakers approved cutting all but $800,000 from Bush's  requested $85.5 million for bases in those countries. The full House is  expected to act in a few days on the legislation.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Valeriy Demidetskiy] </F>   [Text] Kishinev [Chisinau] 19 April TASS -- A statement of  the Romanian Parliament's Chamber of Deputies to denounce  Moldovan joining of the Commonwealth of Independent States and  the CIS economic union was estimated by Kishinev as an  interference in internal affairs of independent Moldova.    Deputy Moldovan parliament speaker and leader of the ruling  Agrarian-Democratic Party Dumitru Motspan told ITAR-TASS that  the leadership of independent Moldova "does not intend to ask  for permission to conclude beneficial treaties and will not  tolerate interference in its internal affairs."</p>

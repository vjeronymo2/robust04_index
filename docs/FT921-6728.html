			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / FT Conference: Bank director defends deregulation - International Banking IN SPITE of the upheavals in the financial services sector during the past few years, there is no possibility of pushing back the pendulum to where it was before financial markets were deregulated, Mr Brian Quinn, executive director of the Bank of England, said yesterday. Speaking at a Financial Times conference on International Banking in London, Mr Quinn defended the deregulation of financial services markets in the 1980s. 'It is very clear to me that the users of banking and financial services have derived very considerable benefits from the liberalisation of market,' he said. He warned about the growing costs of maintaining an orderly banking system. 'Banking systems have been stretched to a degree not seen for many years, and in some countries substantial public financial resources have had to be devoted to propping up the system.' Mr Quinn revealed that the Bank and other banking supervisors in the Basle Committee were examining the criteria for bank authorisation and communication in the light of recent developments, including the possibility of requiring banking groups with complex structures to have greater transparency in their operations. However, in reply to a question about Bank of Credit and Commerce, Mr Quinn said he felt it was important not to overreact to the episode. 'BCCI was a unique organisation in my experience. I have never seen anything like it before or since,' he said. Mr Quinn appeared to pour cold water on some large building societies' hopes that they may soon be regulated in the same way as banks.</p>

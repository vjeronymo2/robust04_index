			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / A deal to trade shares for reform hangs in the air: Hopes of a breakthrough in talks between United Airlines and its workers This year United Airlines overtook American Airlines as the biggest US carrier in terms of passenger miles flown. In the third quarter, it reported a leap in net income from Dollars 6m to Dollars 149m. It is sitting on a cash mountain of Dollars 2bn. Surely it must be the happiest airline in the business? Actually, no: it is in trouble. Its third-quarter profit was largely due to windfall gains from a slump in jet fuel prices, and fell far short of producing an acceptable margin on revenue of Dollars 4bn. Mr Stephen Wolf, chairman and chief executive, has said that UAL will still report a loss for the fourth quarter and the year as a whole. Worse, the company is failing to fend off growing competition from low-cost carriers such as Southwest Airlines, which are encroaching on its markets and driving down fares. Any other airline company in such difficulties would look vulnerable to a takeover. United is no exception. In United's case, however, it is not a competing airline that is bidding to take over the company, but the carrier's own employees. For months, United's management has been conducting on-off talks with its labour unions over a deal to secure the company's future. This week the negotiations entered what appeared to be a make-or-break phase as the two sides met again to discuss a deal that could give union members up to 60 per cent of the company's equity in return for billions of dollars' worth of labour concessions. The company's market capitalisation is about Dollars 3.7bn. The two sides have been driven together out of a mutual recognition that United has little future in its present form. Small carriers offering no-frills services are turning domestic air travel into a low-margin commodity business in the US, and the larger carriers must cut costs to survive. United wants to respond by setting up a low-cost subsidiary to take over its short-haul domestic services. But that would mean shedding thousands of jobs, cutting wages and benefits and increasing productivity through changes in work rules. With both sides anxious to avoid a potentially ruinous strike, the airline and its unions have been seeking a deal that would allow employees to take the net present value of the stream of earnings flowing from their labour concessions and trade it for shares in the company - a path already trodden at Northwest Airlines, where employees own 37.5 per cent of the equity, and Trans World Airlines, where they own 45 per cent. Leaked details of the negotiations suggest the unions want 60 per cent of a recapitalised United Airlines in return for a package made up mainly of labour concessions. It would also comprise loan notes. They value the package at Dollars 5.5bn, but United says it is worth less. The company is believed to have made a counter-offer of a 50.1 per cent stake in return for an improved package from the workers, with an arrangement for the stake to rise to 60 per cent if certain performance criteria are met. It has been hard to inject urgency into the talks at a time when United appears to be in financial health. The deals at Northwest and TWA were done only when the airlines were on the brink of collapse. But the pressure is building up. United has threatened to pull out of short-haul domestic flights and to shrink the business down to a profitable core if it does not get a deal with the unions soon. Last month it agreed the sale of its flight kitchens business, employing 5,200 people. This week the talks took a new turn with the arrival of a powerful intermediary: Mr Felix Rohatyn of Lazard Freres, the Wall Street investment bank. Mr Rohatyn is a respected deal maker who played a key role in saving the city of New York from bankruptcy in the mid-1970s. Hopes are high that Mr Rohatyn will achieve the breakthrough that all parties desire. If he fails, United will unilaterally embark on a contraction of its business that will cut thousands of jobs from its 86,000 total. Nobody knows quite how the unions will respond, but they are unlikely to take it lying down.</p>

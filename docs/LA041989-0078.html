Ben Kramer, a nationally known powerboat racer serving a  life sentence for marijuana smuggling, and sea-urchin diver Charlie Stevens,  both 34, were charged as they recuperated at Jackson Memorial Hospital. Stevens  crashed his two-seater Bell helicopter Monday after it snagged on a 14-foot  wire security fence around the Metropolitan Correctional Center during an  attempt to take Kramer out of a recreation yard. Kramer suffered a compound  fracture to his left ankle and was listed in satisfactory condition. Stevens,  with two broken legs and injuries to the head, neck and back, was in good  condition.  </P></p>

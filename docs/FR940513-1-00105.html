In particular, subparts C and E of these regulations are under review. Subpart C (Child Labor Reg. 3) specifies permissible hours and time standards, as well as occupational limitations, for 14- and 15-year-old employees. Subpart E identifies occupations deemed particularly hazardous for, or detrimental to the health or well-being of, employees under 18 years of age. This advance notice of proposed rulemaking seeks the views of the public on needed changes to these regulations, and also with respect to other aspects of the regulations.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments are due on or before August 11, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Submit written comments to the Administrator, Wage and Hour Division, U.S. Department of Labor, room S3506, 200 Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20210, Attention: J.

The Secretary of Labor is authorized to provide by regulation for the employment of young workers 14 and 15 years of age in suitable occupations other than manufacturing or mining, and during periods and under conditions which will not interfere with their schooling or with their health and well-being. These provisions also permit 16- and 17-year-old minors to be employed in the nonagricultural sector, without hours or time limitations, subject to prohibitions in occupations found and declared by the Secretary of Labor to be particularly hazardous, or detrimental to the health or well-being of minors under age 18. In agriculture, minors 14 and older may be engaged in general employment, subject to prohibitions on occupations declared particularly hazardous by the Secretary of Labor. Additionally, in agriculture 12- and 13-year-olds may be employed with written parental consent or on a farm where the minor's parent is also employed. Under very limited waiver conditions, 10- and 11-year-olds may be employed outside of school hours in agriculture as hand harvesters of short season crops for a maximum annual period of eight weeks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The regulations for 14- and 15-year olds are known as Child Labor Regulation No. 3 (Reg. 3) and are contained in subpart C of 29 CFR part 570. Reg. 3, as amended, limits the hours that 14- and 15-year-olds may work to:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Outside school hours;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Not more than 40 hours in any one week when school is not in session;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Not more than 18 hours in any one week when school is in session;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Not more than 8 hours in any day when school is not in session;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Not more than 3 hours in any day when school is in session; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m., except during the summer (June 1 through Labor Day) when the evening hour is extended to 9 p.m.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

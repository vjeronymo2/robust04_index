			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / As They Say in Europe: Oh, for the good old days 'WESTERN EUROPE enters the 1990s with a new-found confidence that would have seemed fanciful only a couple of years ago. Gone are the pessimism and talk of 'Eurosclerosis' bred by chronically rising joblessness. Instead, confidence has returned, employment expansion has resumed and investment has surged.' This passage from the February 1990 edition of World Financial Markets, published by the bank, JP Morgan, is not reproduced in any spirit of malice or Schadenfreude (tee hee) but as a reflection of how people saw things in those distant days. The Copenhagen summit showed how distant they are. As Die Welt put it: 'Nobody thought that the blooming European economy would fall behind the US and Japan. So that brings up a painful question: will Europe refuse this challenge, just as it did the conflict in Yugoslavia? The 20m unemployed in the EC destroys the reputation of one of the great world economic organisations which sang to its citizens of the welfare-promise of the internal market and the Union-anthem of the 'splendid times' of Maastricht.' As Die Welt noted, and JP Morgan said at the time, the optimism of those days was based on the belief that the single market could solve most of the economic problems while the collapse of of communism had solved the political. The latter event has, in fact, supplied one of those themes dear to novelists of the lesser kind: how a man wastes away once his lifelong enemy dies. Europe provided the main arena for the ideological battle. The western victory was that of the European Community; but the battle absorbed so much physical and intellectual energy that the victors were left wondering what to do for their next trick. They came up with two devices. The single market was already in the making and had to be completed. Then, Maastricht, and the plan for a nicer kind of union ensured that navel-watching became the order of the day. On a wider front, the western system no longer had to prove itself; it had won. That was before unemployment resumed its climb. But the great thing about having 20m west Europeans unemployed today, as opposed to 60 years ago, is that there is little likelihood of those responsible being challenged by alternative views. Contrary to some over-heated reports, fascist storm-troopers are not stomping through Bonn or Berlin. And the nearest thing to a red mob is Liverpool FC Supporters' Club. Choices do, however, remain. A theme of the Copenhagen meeting was what was often portrayed as the unfair competition coming from South-East Asia and even the US. Niels Helveg Petersen, the Danish foreign minister, spoke disparagingly of US society - it was a regrettably unregulated model which had led to the creation of a potentially criminal underclass. Asia provided the 'uncaring' model. Europe had to maintain its specific role as the supplier of free market welfare. The trouble is that this system translates automatically into government spending and extra costs. In Asia, welfare comes from self-provision, the classic example being Singapore's Central Provident Fund - in effect, a system of forced saving. The government exacts a levy on incomes to provide direct investment in the national economy which, in turn, becomes a pension fund. So, if the premises are true, the oriental system leads to saving and investment, the European to excess state spending and budget deficits. Europe has made its choice, which would seem to be the civilised option. And, as Oliver Wendell Holmes (or someone very like him) said: 'Taxes are the price I pay for civilisation.' But it has produced a system that has to 'care' above and beyond the purposes for which it was designed originally. The response, as we have seen most notably in France, is to spread a new myth of the Yellow Peril. The Paris papers write of 'Asiatic Ants' who threaten Europe's prosperity. While this is typical of the nonsense emanating from that capital these days, it is hard to avoid the impression that, in fact, Europe is coming to see itself as entering a new sort of ideological war to replace the the old one. Yet, even at the risk of making my own observations appear rather less pertinent than I would like, we are probably the victims of Euro-morosite and Euro-angst. After all, if all these ghastly things we talk about are true now, they cannot suddenly have become true in the past three years. Some time soon, I expect I shall be writing: 'Western Europe is entering the 21st century with a new-found confidence that would have seemed fanciful only a couple of years ago. Gone are the pessimism and the talk of Euro-uncompetitiveness bred by chronically rising joblessness . . .' Well, you can write it yourself.

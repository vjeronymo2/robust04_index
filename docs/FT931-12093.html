			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / How to Spend It: Simply effortless chic - Lucia van der Post with smart bags WHILE it is perfectly true that the itsy-bitsy handbag, the modishly scaled-down scrap of silk or softest calf, is still very much in vogue, for most of us they have to be regarded as a bit of fashionable fun. For our other, more everyday lives we have different requirements from our handbags. We need something that combines insouciant chic with a certain sturdiness and an elastic capacity to hold the cheque-book, the credit cards, the handkerchief, the billet-doux, the bills and the other paraphernalia that somehow effortlessly finds its way into our handbags. Those who are forever in search of this paragon and have yet to find it might like to look at the range produced by Baronessa Franchetti and on sale now at Franchetti Bond, 7 Burlington Aracade, Piccadilly, London W1 and at 5 Lion and Lamb yard, Farnham, Surrey, GU9 7 LL. The Baroness's life in handbags began in a humble enough way - importing other people's designs from Italy and selling them in the UK. From there she has expanded into designing her own range and she does seem to have the knack of producing bags that combine a certain panache with real practicality. For the working woman there are bags that are big enough to function as briefcases - they will take A4 size folders and documents - which also look soft and relaxed. She uses lovely leathers - all treated and waxed to protect from water and scratches - and uses her own Franchetti coat of arms as a signature on all her pieces. For summer there are some striking fabric bags - the one in navy-blue cotton with tan leather straps, photographed opposite, is a splendid example of her combination of practicality and chic. Prices are good - ranging from about Pounds 35 for some of the fabric versions to Pounds 150 or so for the all-leather. If more serious luggage is on your agenda then it is worth knowing that for the first time the smart German label MCM is available in this country at Harrods. Much of the range seems to suffer from too much rather than too little design and some of it is really awfully grand, the sort of pieces that require porters and trolleys and hefty tips but the quality is excellent and there are some splendidly useful designs - in particular the tan rucksack, the Gladstone-like travelling bag, the soft weekend travelling bag, all from the Nature range - that are beautifully made and effortlessly chic.</p>

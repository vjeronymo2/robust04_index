"Operation Blue Rag," a federally funded operation targeting  the gang members, swept a number of suspected drug traffickers from  neighborhoods with notorious reputations as hangouts for crack cocaine dealing  and other criminal activity, the San Diego County district attorney's office  said. Eight of the suspects were arrested on federal charges but the majority  were booked on state charges involving drug sales and possession of drugs and  weapons.  </P></p>

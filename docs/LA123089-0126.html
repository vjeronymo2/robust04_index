			<p><P> December 30, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> INVASION BY MEDFLY DEFIES LOGIC, SCIENTISTS SAY;  </P> <P> INFESTATION: EXPERTS DISCOVER PECULIAR PATTERNS IN THE SPREAD OF THE STUBBORN  FRUIT FLY. SOME SUSPECT SABOTAGE BY BIOLOGICAL TERRORISTS.  </P> <P> As the battle against the Mediterranean fruit fly enters a new year and aerial  pesticide spraying covers still more neighborhoods in Orange and Los Angeles  counties, state and federal officials remain baffled by several aspects of a  stubborn infestation.  </P> <P> "There are some peculiar things happening," said Caroll Calkins, a researcher  in the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Insect Behavior Unit in Gainesville,  Fla.  </P> <P> For instance, some of the scientists are puzzled by the small number of Medfly  larvae that have turned up. It is in this insect stage that the Medfly does its  greatest damage to fruit and vegetables. The scientists believe an infestation  this size should produce more evidence of larvae.  </P> <P> Others wonder why 23 out of 30 fertile flies trapped on the infestation's  frontier during the last month have been females, and have been found in only  one of the three kinds of Medfly traps. Agriculture officials said they cannot  explain why more males aren't being trapped.  </P> <P> And in a final riddle, many of the Medflies have been trapped just outside  previous spray zones, forcing steady expansion of the area undergoing malathion  treatments. Some experts said the pattern is as illogical as it is frustrating.  </P> <P> At a meeting in Los Angeles on Dec. 6, the scientific panel questioned whether  the unexplained patterns of infestation might lend credence to a letter  distributed by a group that calls itself the Breeders. In the letter, sent to  newspapers and Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley, the group claimed to be spreading  Medflies to protest California agricultural practices.  </P> <P> Roy Cunningham, a Department of Agriculture Medfly expert and chairman of the  panel, said Friday that the panel is taking this possibility seriously but  still feels there is no proof: "We don't see any hard evidence (that the letter  writer) has the wherewithal to do what he has threatened."  </P> <P> The Breeders letter was turned over to the Los Angeles Police Department's  Criminal Conspiracy Section. Department spokesman Cmdr. William Booth said  investigators have "made some progress."  </P> <P> At the advisory panel meeting, according to one member who was present, one  adviser suggested that the finding of females in just one type of trap, known  as a McPhail trap, could be evidence of sabotage. In interviews, scientists  have also said the small numbers of larvae, which indicate a natural breeding  population of Medflies, and the nagging pattern of new flies emerging just  outside spray zones could fuel suspicions that the flies are being spread by  the Breeders.  </P> <P> At the same time, other, more benign scenarios are being circulated in an  attempt to explain the infestation's quirks. For instance, James Carey, a  member of the science panel, said the small number of larvae detected does not  necessarily mean that the fly is being spread unnaturally, rather than by  breeding and moving.  </P> <P> It is his opinion that the Los Angeles infestation could date back several  years and that the bug has become established in the region. He is a minority  voice on the panel on that point.  </P> <P> Calkins said the lack of larvae could show that the infestation was small and  isolated, and located away from traps.  </P> <P> Authorities believe the current infestation began in Whittier, where a Medfly  was first trapped on Sept. 26. They believe this because larvae were detected  there, indicating the existence of a breeding population.  </P> <P> As the infestation spread across the Los Angeles Basin to parts of Brea, La  Habra and Fullerton in Orange County, however, scientists did not find nearly  as many larvae.  </P> <P> The life cycle of a Medfly begins with the laying of eggs in a piece of fruit  or a vegetable. When the eggs hatch several days later, the larvae feed on the  fruit, turning it into an inedible mush. The bugs drop to the ground and  continue developing in a pupal stage, and the adult flies emerge later.  </P> <P> Three types of traps are being used to lure Medflies -- the Jackson, Steiner  and McPhail traps. Almost all of the flies are females, and are showing up in  the McPhail traps. It would be expected that males would be caught in the  Jackson trap, which contains a sex lure that has proven effective in past  Medfly invasions.  </P></p>

			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / Survey of Dutch Banking and Finance (8): Dollars 4bn sell-off was historic peak - Apart from KPN, there are few big privatisations left in the Netherlands The Netherlands' privatisation programme reached a historic peak in early June when the government sold a 30 per cent stake in Koninklijke PTT Nederland (KPN), the country's telecommunications and postal company, to investors for Fl 6.9bn (Dollars 3.9bn). A second tranche of KPN shares, representing a holding of at least 20 per cent but probably significantly more, is due to take place before the end of 1997. At the present share price for KPN, this would raise a minimum of Fl 4.6bn for the government, and mark another important milestone for privatisation in the Netherlands. However, apart from the rich pickings offered by KPN, there are few big privatisations left in the Netherlands, a country which never went in for the large-scale nationalisations that have left European counterparts such as France and Italy with holdings ranging from banks and insurers to computer companies. So far, the new government that was sworn in late last month has given no sign that it intends to step up the pace of privatisations. Unlike some other countries, privatisation is normally a politically neutral concept in the Netherlands. The Dutch state has not made long-term, concerted efforts to create a 'people's capitalism' along the lines of that which Margaret Thatcher pursued when she was prime minister of the UK. At the same time, privatisation is not a party-political issue. This was underlined by the KPN transaction, which took place a month after an inconclusive general election had left the country in a political vacuum with a caretaker government. However, because all four main political parties had given full support to the flotation ahead of the election, the sell-off went ahead as planned and as scheduled. The lack of political opposition to privatisation in the Netherlands means that most of the rest of the state's corporate holdings could be sold off without too much difficulty. In Dutch, 'privatisation' has a double meaning that can be confusing to foreigners. As in the Anglo-Saxon sense of the word, it can mean the sale of government shares to outside investors, generally by means of a bourse flotation. But it can also mean the process by which a government entity or organisation is turned into a public limited company and allowed to act like a private, commercial enterprise. All the shares remain government-owned, but the organisation is considered to be part of the private sector. This was done at KPN in 1989, as a prelude to this year's bourse flotation. But the same process has taken place at smaller organisations, such as the State Mint, which mints government coins and medals. Its 'privatisation' took place on January 1. 'For the time being, all shares will remain in government hands,' the finance ministry said. 'But it cannot be ruled out that the mint may be sold if there is an attractive offer from a serious company.' The Dutch state's holdings are a mixture of minority stakes in publicly-quoted companies, such as steel group Hoogovens, chemicals group DSM and the national carrier KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, as well as 100 per cent ownership of organisations such as Dutch Rail and the Government Printing Office. Many of the stakes, such as the government's minority holding in Fokker, the aircraft manufacturer, are the results of rescues or capital injections. The Dutch state tends to see these holdings as temporary and when circumstances permit will reduce its stakes. In the case of KLM, the government's stake has fallen from as high as 78 per cent in the mid-1970s to around 38.2 per cent today. Shares owned in companies that already have a share listing are easier for the Dutch state to sell. One of most obvious candidates in this category is DSM, in which the government still has a 31 per cent stake following the public sale of the rest of its shares in two tranches of around 34 per cent each in January and September 1989. Unlike the situation surrounding KLM, where there is perhaps a strategic value in owning shares because of the political nature of international aviation agreements, there is no reason for the Dutch state to hold on to its DSM shares. However, no date has been given for the sell-off. 'We have a written commitment from the state that it will first consult with us,' said Ad Timmermans, the company's finance director, last month. The company has said it would prefer the next, and presumably last, tranche of the state's shares not to be sold through a public offering, as in the previous two tranches, to avoid the need for time-consuming road shows to potential investors. The DSM sale is likely, but not guaranteed, to take place later in the 1990s. One definite sale, which has already been agreed in principle, is the divestment of the state's remaining 20 per cent stake in Fokker, the Dutch aircraft maker. Deutsche Aerospace, part of Germany's Daimler-Benz group, bought a 51 per cent stake in Fokker in 1993 through the purchase of new shares and shares owned by the Dutch government. The contract stipulated that the government would sell its remaining stake to DASA in 1996. Apart from DSM and Fokker, there are few immediate privatisation candidates, but there are other possibilities if the government needs to raise money to reduce the large and growing public debt. The remaining choices, however, have the potential to create controversy. For example, the Dutch railway system, sometimes mentioned as a long-term privatisation candidate, is still loss-making. Any sale of the company which would herald a rise in passenger fares could be expected to be controversial. Equally, any move to sell off part of the state's majority holding in Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport would put the government in a delicate position because of the continuing debate between proponents and opponents over the airport's ambitious expansion plans.</p>

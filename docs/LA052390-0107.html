			<p><P> May 23, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STOCKS;  </P> <P> DOW RISES 7.55, AIDED BY DIP IN INTEREST RATES  </P> <P> Fresh declines in interest rates and a late buying surge helped the stock  market extend its spring rally Tuesday, propelling the Dow Jones industrial  index to its fifth record high in the past seven trading sessions.  </P> <P> The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials, which climbed 24.77 points to an  all-time high Monday, gained 7.55 points to set another record -- 2,852.23.  </P> <P> Chances of another advance were in doubt at midday as profit taking eroded a  strong early rally, but buyers appeared in the last 30 minutes to give the  market a lift.  </P> <P> Advancing issues outnumbered losers by 8 to 7 in nationwide trading of New York  Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 816 up, 689 down and 501 unchanged.  </P> <P> Big Board volume surged to 203.35 million shares from Monday's 166.28 million.  </P> <P> The market got an early lift from declining interest rates and a strong  performance on stock markets in Tokyo and London.  </P> <P> After the market opened, the Dow Jones industrials surged nearly 26 points in  the first half hour before stalling.  </P> <P> By noon, the average was slightly below Monday's close, and it drifted in  negative territory most of the afternoon.  </P> <P> "There was probably a little too much exuberance at the beginning," said Newton  Zinder, a market analyst for Shearson Lehman Hutton.  </P> <P> Bill Raftery, vice president for technical research at Smith Barney &amp; Co.,  added at midday, "This is perfectly normal profit taking."  </P> <P> The stock market has rolled up impressive gains the past three weeks in a rally  attributed mainly to declines in interest rates.  </P> <P> Declining rates help stocks by making the potential rewards on them more  appealing than yields on fixed-income investments. Lower rates also can improve  the profit outlook for some companies by cutting their borrowing costs.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, some market watchers expect a correction in the stock market that  will drive prices lower.  </P> <P> Even small declines in stock prices appeared to draw out buying interest in the  last 30 minutes of the session, lifting the market higher.  </P> <P> "It shows that even modest price discounts are being met by anxious buyers who  have missed this three-week old rally -- and short sellers," said Alfred E.  Goldman, director of technical market analysis at A. G. Edwards &amp; Sons Inc.  in St. Louis.  </P> <P> Short-sellers are traders who establish positions based on the presumption that  prices will fall; they are drawn into the market as buyers when it becomes  clear that they have bet wrong and have to settle their accounts.  </P> <P> The most actively traded issue on the NYSE was Nova Corp. of Alberta, Canada,  which fell 3/8 to 7 following a 1/2-point gain in active dealing Monday. The  company said Monday it was selling its rubber division.  </P> <P> Computer Associates International fell 3/8 to 15 1/2 after reporting earnings  results that disappointed some analysts.  </P> <P> Among widely held stocks, Philip Morris rose 1/2 to 45, American Telephone  &amp; Telegraph lost 1/4 to 43 1/8 and International Business Machines was up  3/4 to 117 3/4.  </P> <P> Federal Express tumbled 5 1/8 to 47 amid apparent disappointment over April  volume figures released late Monday.  </P> <P> In Tokyo, stocks closed up as a stronger yen helped the market regain ground  lost in the morning. But analysts were still worried about the near-term trend.  The 225-share Nikkei average rose 173.25 points to 31,938.30.  </P> <P> Strong buying interest propelled shares sharply higher in active trading on  London's stock exchange. The Financial Times 100-share index closed up 29.2  points at 2,311.3.  </P> <P> CREDIT  </P> <P> Foreign Purchases Boost Bond Prices  </P> <P> Bond prices snapped a three-day lull, strengthened by foreign buying and a news  report that suggested the yawning federal deficit might not be so intractable.  </P> <P> The 30-year Treasury bond, a closely followed barometer of the market's mood,  rose more than $8 per $1,000 in face amount, its first big advance since last  Wednesday. The bond's yield, which falls when prices rise, dropped to 8.60%  from 8.68% the previous session.  </P> <P> Bond strategists attributed the market's rise partly to evidence of significant  purchases of intermediate-maturity Treasuries by foreigners. Some reckoned that  the buyers were oil-producing Persian Gulf countries looking for safe ways to  put pools of cash to work.  </P> <P> Others said the market rallied on a report in the Chicago Tribune that several  federal agencies had amassed $50 billion in unspent appropriations, which  presumably could be used to narrow the federal deficit.  </P> <P> The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each other on overnight  loans, was quoted at 8.188%, unchanged from late Monday.  </P> <P> CURRENCY  </P> <P> Dollar Goes Higher; Mark Still Reeling  </P> <P> The dollar gained ground against most other currencies, particularly the West  German mark, which remained under pressure as a result of growing political  discord over plans to reunite with East Germany.  </P> <P> Currency dealers said the dollar benefited from continued weakness in the mark  related to concern about the future of the reunification plan.  </P> <P> The dollar rose in Europe to 1.6685 West German marks from 1.6630 Monday and to  1.67315 marks in New York from 1.66245.  </P> <P> COMMODITIES  </P> <P> Cocoa Futures Hit a 14-Month High  </P> <P> Cocoa futures prices seesawed to a 14-month high on New York's Coffee, Sugar  and Cocoa Exchange amid mounting fears of supply disruptions from the Ivory  Coast, the world's largest producer.  </P> <P> On other commodity markets, precious metal futures rose; copper advanced;  grains and soybeans were mostly lower; energy futures were mixed, and livestock  and meat futures were mixed.  </P> <P> Cocoa futures settled $39 to $45 higher, with the contract for delivery in July  at $1,491 a ton.  </P></p>

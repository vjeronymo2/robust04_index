			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / Councils fear poll tax delays ANY CHANGE to the uniform business rate in the Budget should not be allowed to delay poll tax bills, Mr Jeremy Beecham, chairman of the Labour-dominated Association of Metropolitan Authorities, urged yesterday. Mr Beecham wrote to Mr Michael Heseltine, environment secretary, seeking reassurance that 'the government is not planning a repeat of last year's billing fiasco by implementing a late change in the national non-domestic rate which would not affect the amount of poll tax to be paid, but which could cause weeks of delay in sending out the 1992-93 poll tax bills'. The Department of the Environment said that any potential change to the business rate need not affect billing because the level of money from the business-rate pool could be held steady by the government.</p>

Pandit: "Congress (I) is Fighting Over </F> Dunkel Proposals"]    [Text] The Dunkel proposals have enveloped the government  in such a way that the prime minister and the cabinet members  are at their wits ends. The Lok Sabha chairman and the Rajya  Sabha vice chairman have been waiting all week for the  government to resolve this issue since the Parliament's  activities could not be stopped indefinitely. Finally, on  Friday, the opposition dissatisfied even after the statement  issued by the Commerce Minister Pranab Mukherji in the presence  of the prime minister walked out of the Lok Sabha. In the Rajya  Sabha, Vice Chairperson Nazma Heptullah very smartly announced  adjourning the meeting until Monday as soon as the commerce  minister had finished his speech. The opposition was still  demanding that Prime Minister Narasimha Rao must clarify the  whole issue himself. The opposition, however, did not even let  the proceeding go as far as questions session.    Mr. Mukerhji says that the government's decision is  appropriate because this will help improve the country's economy  and this is the only way to improve our trade. In the Lok Sabha,  he opened his mouth only once in the presence of the prime  minister to say that the unity of the developing countries did  not last long in the talks over international trade and tariff.  In the Rajya Sabha, the prime minister stood up only for a  second to deny an opposition accusation that the government did  not want to discuss this international agreement in the House.  Mr. Pranab Mukherji also clarified that government's approving  the Dunkel proposals does not mean that we have mortgaged the  autonomy of our country. Mr. Mukherji's clarification raised the  question as to how 117 countries in the world have agreed to  this proposal. The question is based on one point on which the  whole opposition is arguing: How will the farmers benefit from  it? Mr. Pranab Mukherji responded that it was true the farmer  could use their own seeds but will not have the right to sell  them. Similarly, Mr. Mukherji admitted that prices of some drugs  will increase. However, he said, this will not cause much of a  problem because controlled rate shops will be opened and special  agreement made for distribution of fertilizers. The government  subsidy policy will not be affected by this agreement.    The government assured us that if the business of a  multi-national company proved to be against the nation's  interests the government could always use its right to close  that company's business here. Both houses of the Parliament were  very active from Monday to Friday discussing the GATT and Dunkel  issues. These discussions have been postponed until Monday after  the clarifications made by the commerce minister and the prime  minister on Friday. However, it seems that the Dunkel affair  will quiet down in the Parliament and out of it.    It appears that Lok Sabha Chairperson Shivraj Patil must  have  pulled off a miracle, because it was hinted at the beginning of  the discussion that only Mr. Mukherji would respond to the  questions, and the prime minister could interrupt him if  necessary. The commerce minister could not give satisfactory  answers to questions posed by veteran opposition leaders such as  Somnath Chaterji, Inderjit Gupta, Nitish Kumar, and George. This  indicates that the strategy formed by the veteran opposition  leaders on this issue has been suspended for a while. They will  cause additional problems for the government, however, by  raising this issue in a new format since the winter session of  the Parliament will continue for one more week.    The BJP sent a letter to President Shankar Dayal Sharma the  same day. It accused the government of signing the GATT  agreement under international pressure and of tying down the  future generation of the nation in the knots of unfair  international trade system. In this letter, the BJP also said  that the arrest of its leaders was motivated by the government's  malicious and improper attitude.</p>

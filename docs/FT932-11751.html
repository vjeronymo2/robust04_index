			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / Court rules personal-contract 'sweeteners' illegal THE OFFERING of financial incentives to staff by employers to assist the de-recognition of trade unions is a breach of employment law, the Court of Appeal ruled yesterday. In a judgment with widespread implications for the introduction of personal contracts throughout industry, three judges decided that employers' use of incentives amounted to unlawful discrimination against an employee's right to belong to a union. The judges upheld two appeals by members of the transport union RMT and the National Union of Journalists whose employers, Associated British Ports and Associated Newspapers, publisher of the Daily Mail, had offered pay increases to staff prepared to sign personal contracts but denied them to those who wanted to remain union members. Lord Justice Dillon said this amounted to a breach of section 23 of the Employment Protection Act 1978, which protects employees' rights to belong to a union. He rejected the employers' argument that if individuals were given a choice, such as accepting a personal contract or remaining in a union, they were not being penalised. Lord Dillon said the judgment did not affect the right of employers to de-recognise unions or to require changes in employees' terms and conditions. But employers enter a potential danger area offering a 'douceur' (sweetener) to employees who support their policy but not to those opposed to it, he said. The court's ruling was welcomed by the two unions which had brought the appeals. Mr John Foster, general secretary of the NUJ, said it amounted to a substantial reassertion of union rights which would have widespread implications for attempts by employers to introduce personal contracts. The NUJ is dealing with a series of similar cases from the newspaper industry. Mr Paul Statham, a lawyer for RMT, said more union members would be able to seek redress from industrial tribunals if they believed they had been penalised because of their union membership. Although ABP ruled out a further appeal, Associated Newspapers said it would appeal to the House of Lords. 'The Court of Appeal's decision has thrown the law into confusion,' Associated said.</p>

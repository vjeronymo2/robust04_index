			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading THE EXPIRY of the September contract on the FT-SE Index in no way impaired another powerful performance in derivatives yesterday, writes Terry Byland. The expiry passed off comfortably at the appointed time - just after 10.00am  -and the December contract recorded 23,246 contracts by the official close, when it showed a a comfortable premium of around seven points against fair value, which is the estimated level allowing for carrying costs and dividends. The December contract was spurred ahead by widespread predictions that UK base rates will be cut by at least two points before the end of the year. Such optimism was encouraged by comments from the UK chancellor of the exchequer and by falling short sterling rates. At best, September touched 2,644 but at one stage lagged slightly behind an over-excited underlying equity market. Another heavy day in Traded Options saw 73,698 contracts dealt, against 69,249. The FT-SE traded 28,933 contracts compared with 27,204, an the Euro FT-SE was also busy, with 8,360 contracts. BP, 4,921 contracts, headed the list of individual stocks.</p>

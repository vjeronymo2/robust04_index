			<p><P> April 15, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HARRY BRIDGES  </P> <P> The death of Harry Bridges (Part A, March 31) marks the passing of a remarkable  American citizen of Marxist persuasion, whose honesty and dedication place him  among the highest level in the history of the American labor movement.  </P> <P> He lived modestly and did not enrich himself at the expense of his workers.  Instead he consistently fought for their rights and interests.  </P> <P> Bridges will be remembered for many years to come, while many of his detractors  are among the forgotten.  </P> <P> GENE GALVIN  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

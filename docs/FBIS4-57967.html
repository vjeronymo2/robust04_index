			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Alfonso Malespin Jiron] </F>   [Text] Bayardo Arce, member of the National Directorate of  the FSLN [Sandinist National Liberation Front], has said Dr.  Sergio Ramirez should continue to head the Sandinist bloc in the  National Assembly because he has done an excellent job and  because this decision should be left in the hands of bloc  members. "I do not think he will be replaced," Arce added.    Arce said the expansion of the FSLN National Directorate to  15 members and the ratification of most members of the  traditional National Directorate were outstanding decisions made  at the Sandinist Special Congress.    The vote by the congress delegates left out only two  previous  members of the top Sandinist executive body, namely, Dr. Sergio  Ramirez and Commander Jaime Wheelock, who did not run because he  is studying abroad.    The removal of Dr. Ramirez "is in keeping with the need and  the will voiced by the congress to renew the leadership and to  endorse the traditional directorate," Arce said.    He said this action should not be interpreted as "punishment  of an individual" who had supported the theory that Sandinism  should respond to the majority, as certain people had claimed in  the halls of the Olof Palme Convention Center. "Although, we  could talk about a political defeat," Arce said, "I actually  think the congress had to simply choose 15 people. It is like a  baseball game in which someone has to win and someone has to  lose."    Nevertheless, Arce believes Dr. Ramirez will not be left out  of the decisionmaking process. He added that among the National  Directorate's first tasks will be the creation of new  mechanisms, a task that will benefit from his knowledge and  experience.    Arce, who supported the candidacy of Daniel Ortega on the  opening day of the congress, downplayed Dr. Ramirez's absence at  the closing ceremony. He said the same was true for Commander  Victor Tirado, who was brought from his residence after being  approved as a National Directorate member.    "I do not give any political significance to Sergio's  absence," Arce pointed out. "I want you to know that if Daniel  had extended his speech, I would have fallen asleep," the  high-ranking leader joked.    During an informal news conference after the closing of the  congress, Arce refused to say whether Sandinism achieved a  consensus during the three days of discussions, but he did say,  "we achieved substantial progress," and he suggested heeding  Commander Ortega's invitation to continue fine-tuning the  discussions.    Arce thinks the mixture of traditional and new figures poses  a challenge to the National Directorate: "We need to learn from  the incoming youths and climb to the level set by our heroes and  martyrs, whom we replaced in the struggle against the  dictatorship."</p>

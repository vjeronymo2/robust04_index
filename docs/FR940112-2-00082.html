			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Admittedly, even a cursory examination of the regulations reveals that the Secretary envisioned their application within a traditional employment context. Importantly, however, nothing in the Act or its regulations specifically requires SGA to be lawful. This silence, we believe, suggests that illegal activities can constitute SGA. The inference is strengthened, moreover, when considering that the relevant considerations noted above apply with almost equal ease irrespective of the legality of the activities involved. Thus, one can envision a number of illegal activities that might not rise to the level of SGA. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 7 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Whether legally or illegally employed, the regulations direct an ALJ to focus on whether the claimant is performing significant physical or mental activities, and doing so with the intent of earning money or making a profit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 7 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> For example, acting as a lookout at a drug house might constitute a gainful yet insubstantial activity, whereas someone who chronically engages in acts of vandalism may be substantially, but not gainfully, occupied.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Moreover, it must be remembered that an ALJ performs the SGA analysis as one of five steps used to determine whether a person is disabled and, consequently, unable to function within our economy. A claimant who can manage through illegal means is just as undeserving of benefits as a claimant who can survive without violating the law. For this reason, there is no difference between the addict who spends all of his lawfully derived earnings on narcotics and the one who illegally obtains, and then exhausts, her income. Both are fueled, to quote Dotson, by the ``cravings of unquenchable drug addiction.'' The only real distinction between the two_the lawfulness of their income_finds no cognizance under the Act and its interpretive regulations. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 8 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 8 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Indeed, were we to hold otherwise, the court would be creating the perverse incentive_although admittedly only at the margins_for both SSI claimants and recipients to engage in illegal activity because the income therefrom would be ignored.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Finally, our conclusion that illegal activity can constitute SGA derives substantial support from the well-established tax principle that unlawful earnings come within the meaning of the term ``gross income'' and are thus taxable. See,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g., James  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> United States, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  366 U.S. 213, 218 (1961) (plurality opinion of Warren, C.J.),  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> overruling Commissioner  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Wilcox, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  327 U.S. 404 (1946);  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> United States  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Sullivan, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  274 U.S. 259, 263 (1927). Notably, the Act has adopted the tax code's definition of gross income for purposes of determining whether a SSI claimant's income is sufficiently high so as to render him or her ineligible for benefits. 42 U.S.C. 1382(d); see also 20 CFR 416.1110(b). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 9 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Indeed, one of the concerns motivating the plurality in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> James,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ``to remove the incongruity of having the gains of the honest laborer taxed and the gains of the dishonest immune,'' 366 U.S. at 218, provides the crux of our reasoning in this case.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 9 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Again, however, the resources and income analysis implicated here and discussed at note 6,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> is different from the ALJ's responsibility to determine whether a claimant is engaging in SGA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Sufficiency of the Evidence  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Having concluded that illegal activity can constitute SGA, we must next determine whether the ALJ properly applied the legal standard in Dotson's case. Our inquiry is a limited one. We will not decide facts anew, reweigh evidence, or substitute our judgment for the Secretary's.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Schroeter  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Sullivan,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 977 F.2d 391, 394 (7th Cir. 1992). Rather, we look to see whether ``substantial evidence'' supports the ALJ's findings. See 42 U.S.C. 1383(c)(3) (citing 42 U.S.C. 405(g)). Substantial evidence is ``such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.''  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Richardson  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Perales, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  402 U.S. 389, 402 (1977).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Dotson first contends that the ALJ had before him no evidence of specific illegal acts which could support a finding of SGA. Secondly, he believes the ALJ erroneously assumed that he paid full street-value for the narcotics he used and, thus, overestimated the amount of income needed to support his drug habit. We address each claim in order. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Dotson also argues that the ALJ erred by underestimating the amount of money he earned through panhandling. As we discussed at note 2,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> the ALJ's decision to discount Dotson's panhandling income_because of the poor area in which he begs_is supported by substantial evidence.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Dotson's first claim, that the record lacks any evidence of illegal activities, is belied by his own testimony and by the reasonable inferences drawn therefrom by the ALJ. For example, when the ALJ asked Dotson to describe what types of items he had stolen in the month during which the administrative hearing was held, Dotson replied: ``I try to concentrate on saws.&blank; *&blank;*&blank;*&blank; You know, the chainsaws, the little bitty chainsaws.'' Dotson then went on to explain, in some detail, how he would sell the stolen items. Additionally, the ALJ made at least one specific inquiry into the substantiality of Dotson's activities, asking him how long it takes him to find a place to steal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We grant to Dotson his point that the record contains no evidence concerning any specific act of thievery. Also, we agree with him that the ALJ could have more fully developed the record as to the nature of his criminal undertakings. Nevertheless, we cannot say that the record before us contains less than substantial evidence that Dotson's thievery required the significant use of his physical and mental skills, and that those skills were applied within a context designed to produce pay or profit. See 20 CFR 416.972 (a), (b). In short, Dotson's testimony allowed the ALJ to reasonably conclude that the effort required to steal the chainsaws with regularity constituted SGA, and we therefore uphold this aspect of the ALJ's decision. A more exacting inquiry, while desirable, was not required.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

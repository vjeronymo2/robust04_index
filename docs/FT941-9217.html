			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / Minister faces probe on pension advice The Commons social security committee is to question Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary, on April 27 about the quality of advice offered to people to take out personal pensions, David Owen writes. The committee's questions will focus on the advice given to people who transferred out of the state earnings related pension scheme, or Serps. MPs on the committee argue that figures which show that a considerable number of these people are now unemployed or on low incomes give grounds for believing the advice they were offered was inadequate.</p>

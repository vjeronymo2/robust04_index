They have jobs like most people have jobs. They get a paycheck every week  and they stretch it out, and they are good mothers, good wives, good sisters  and good workers, and they're just good folks."  </P> <P> Actually, Niki Scott used to be a lot more like some of her readers -- with her  struggles as a divorced mother of two trying to meet the rent -- but more and  more she's become the success her readers may dream about. Scott, 46, married  for the second time, writes her Working Woman column -- reaching millions of  readers in 120 newspapers -- from her Mount Desert Island, Maine, home, and  travels around the country reaching thousands more.  </P> <P> The challenge for all working parents, especially working women, she says, "is  that we not get complacent" about gains in the workplace "because it isn't  over. We can't let any semblance of a backlash happen."  </P> <P> The top five concerns among working parents, she says, are: pay, recognition at  work, child care, time and stress.  </P> <P> "The working woman in particular," she says, "is concerned with having it all,  for lack of a better term. I think we're still pretty confused about what that  means. Do we want it all? Can we do it all? I don't think anybody should  underestimate the stress that's involved when we're trying to work at the  office and waiting for the phone to ring, wondering if our children are being  properly taken care of."  </P> <P> In her childhood, one of privilege in New York, Scott had two working parents.  Her father was a top advertising executive; her mother, Martha Dean, was the  host of a radio talk show that Scott recalls as being ahead of its time. "My  mother was supposed to be interviewing people about fashion and gardening, but  she interviewed authors and playwrights and politicians.  </P> <P> "My mother was a terrific role model, and I feel in some way she was a feminist  before there was the word for it." But Scott says the guilt her mother felt  "about whether or not she was doing the right thing with her children" was very  much like the guilt she felt.  </P> <P> Scott had dropped out of Washington College to marry her sweetheart, who worked  in advertising. She worked part time over the years at odd jobs, but after 10  years of marriage and two children, she became a full-time reporter with the  Charlotte (N.C.) News.  </P> <P> While working in the "women's section" in the early 1970s -- "where they were  still telling readers how to fix elegant Beef Bourguignon" -- she decided she  wanted to write a column about women like herself at work. After a year, she  says, "I decided to follow my own advice and set my goals higher, to take a  risk that scared me to death." She was newly divorced when she set up a career  as a free-lance writer. Much to her amazement, Universal Press Syndicate bought  the column in 1976, signing her to a 10-year contract.  </P> <P> That allowed her to move to Maine -- a place where she had always wanted to  live and raise her children -- but contrary to popular misconceptions, she  insists she's not rich, merely comfortable enough to live where she pleases.  </P> <P> Four months of the year, she and her second husband, Joseph Valliant Jr., the  former editor of the Waterman's Gazette, live near Easton, Md. on the Eastern  Shore.  </P> <P> She may live on an island in Maine, but she insists she's not isolated from the  real world. The mail from readers -- almost a third of whom she estimates are  men -- keep her in touch:  </P> <P> "In some ways, things are more difficult and in some ways easier than they were  14 years ago. When I started this column, women were agonizing about whether  they could go to work. Now that question is resolved for most of them. They  have to work. What hasn't changed is that we're still doing full-time jobs at  work and full-time jobs at home, and at the end of the week we're wondering why  we're so exhausted."  </P> <P> But while she believes "some men are taking great strides forward in seeing the  women in their lives as equal partners," others are coming up short in sharing  the role at home, which leads to resentment among many working women.  </P> <P> But would women go home again? "I don't know a single working mother who  wouldn't go home for a year if she could, but I don't think many would want to  stay home longer than that," she says, noting that surveys indicate women  derive as much satisfaction from work as men do. But the reality of women at  work is that one in three is working in a clerical job and nine out of 10 earn  less than $25,000 a year.  </P> <P> The most common conflicts, she says, are generational. "Women my age have heard  young women say 'I don't understand what the problem is. No one's  discriminating against me.' The answer is if you don't think there are any  problems left, you aren't looking. If there are fewer problems, the women ahead  of you made the way." Lowering her voice, she adds, "We cleared the path,  darling."  </P></p>

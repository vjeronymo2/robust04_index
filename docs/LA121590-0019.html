			<p><P> December 15, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RAMS, ROBINSON TAKE HITS FOR THEIR STRATEGY ON AND OFF THE FIELD  </P> <P> Missed opportunities? Fumbles? Interceptions? Give me a break! The real reason  the Rams lost to New Orleans is because John Robinson doesn't have enough faith  in his offensive line to go for a touchdown on fourth and goal from the  half-yard line.  </P> <P> Sorry, Lambs. No guts, no glory.  </P> <P> NEIL R. SHAMBAUGH  </P> <P> Monterey Park  </P></p>

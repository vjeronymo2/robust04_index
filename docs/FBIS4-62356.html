			<p>BFN     [Text] Stepanakert ("LRAGIR", "AZG" dailies), 05/14/94 --  Tension at the RMK [Republic of Mountainous Karabakh] fronts  persists. In spite of the new cease fire agreement, the Azeri  units continue the attacks at the northern and eastern sections  of the front.    The RMK Defense Army headquarters report, military  operations  in the environs of the village of Yusifdzhanli in the Agdamskiy  District continued in the evening of 12 May. The Azeri units  attacked the Armenian defense positions, but were forced to  retreat to the initial positions. About 50 Azeri soldiers were  killed.    The RMK armed forces repulsed the Azeri offensive in the  Seisulan-Karmiravan section in the Mardakertskiy District.  According to the RMK reconnaissance, the enemy continues  concentrating new forces in this direction.    The enemy shelled the village of Berdavan in the  Martuninskiy  District in the evening of 12 May, using "Grad" installations  stationed in the Agdamskiy and Agdzhabediskiy districts.  According to preliminary information, two women were killed,  more than 10 peaceful inhabitants injured. Significant property  damage is reported.    The situation was rather calm on 13 May, only positional  shellings are reported.    An RMK Defense Army representative Serge Arushanyan said the  Azeri side is violating the new cease-fire agreement, and thus  challenging not only Karabakh but also Russia and CSCE,  attempting to fail their efforts on peaceful regulation of the  conflict.</p>

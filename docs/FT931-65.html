			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market report ALUMINIUM prices fell to 14 1/2 -month lows on the LME. Three-month metal failed to hold Dollars 1,150 a tonne once early Far Eastern currency-linked buying had run its course. Renewed liquidation and sell stops pushed the market down. Fundamentals remain gloomy, as stocks continue to grow and no increase in demand is likely in the immediate future. Consumers are able to bide their time, and traders see the market falling back towards Dollars 1,100. COPPER was briefly unsettled by aluminium's losses, but mostly held steady, with the market well supported in a narrow range, dealers said. Dips below Dollars 2,160 a tonne for three-month metal attracted buying and light Chinese interest, although there did not appear to be much upside potential above Dollars 2,170, given the increase in stocks. Chicago WHEAT prices were higher in early trading, with May leading the advance, after an USDA official said that Russia would need 11m to 12m tonnes between July 1993 and June 1994. There was little chance that it could purchase more grain from the EC, Canada or France. Compiled from Reuters</p>

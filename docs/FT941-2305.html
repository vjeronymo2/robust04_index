			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / Sky faces another challenge from pirates Sky Television is facing another challenge from pirates selling unauthorised cards to unlock its scrambled subscription channels. A Bristol-based company is advertising pirate cards which allow viewers to avoid payment for satellite subscription services such as sport and film channels. Telephone callers to Euroservices of Kingswood are told that for Pounds 89.99 an unauthorised card will be provided. This will unlock all available subscription television channels. Sky and News Datacom, the 'smart card' decoder company, said in October that they would pursue pirates in the courts. A representative of Euroservices said yesterday: 'It's not illegal to sell the cards. It's not illegal for you to buy them, but it is illegal to use them. What you do in your own home is your business.' Under the 1990 Broadcasting Act it is, however, illegal to advertise, sell or use unauthorised cards. Sky Television - a consortium in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a stake - has already taken legal action against a number of other pirate suppliers. The Euroservices technical department said that the cards had a detachable chip. If satellite companies took anti-piracy measures and changed the broadcast signal a new chip would be sent within three days at no extra charge. It said the cards were being imported rather than produced locally. The price of Pounds 89.99 is one of the cheapest on offer so far. Sky charges Pounds 19.99 a month for a package that includes all its subscription channels. European satellite television operators are so concerned about the threat from pirate cards that they have formed an international group to co-ordinate counter-measures.</p>

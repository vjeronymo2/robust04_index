			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Communique issued by the National Defense Ministry; place </F> and date not given]    [Text] In line with the implementation of UN Security  Council Resolution 872 of 5 October 1993 under which the council  established the UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda [UNAMIR], our  country, Togo, was requested by the United Nations to send two  contingents to Rwanda. The first contingent comprising military  observers has been operating in Rwanda since December 1993. The  second detachment meant for the UN civil police has been on  mission in Rwanda since January. The Togolese Armed Forces High  Command is in permanent contact with UN and UNAMIR officials.    Following the recent painful events in Rwanda following the  assassination of the Rwandan and Burundian presidents, the  United Nations has taken measures to ensure the security of all  UNAMIR contingents. At the moment, we can assert that the  situation of our detachments in Rwanda does not give cause for  concern.</p>

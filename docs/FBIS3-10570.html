At the conclusion of the visit paid by  Brazilian President Itamar Franco to his Venezuelan counterpart  Rafael Caldera, the importance of the meeting was underlined by  the level of the Brazilian ministers who also came to La Guaira,  that is, the heads of five important ministries in the foreign  affairs field: the industry and commerce, mines and energy,  foreign affairs, environment, and justice ministers.    The two presidents issued a joint communique creating a  high-level binational commission that will be in charge of  stepping up cooperation in the border areas. The commission  will be headed by the foreign ministers, and will include all  the sectors of the Brazilian and Venezuelan economy.    To mark the meeting the presidents signed a protocol which  is  to be added to the 1977 friendship and cooperation agreement  between the two countries. Caldera stated emphatically: "What  happened in the Amazon jungle a few months ago (the murder of  Ianomami Indians) helped us open our eyes, and made us aware of  the need to harmonize our policies and join efforts to attend to  this vast Amazon region, which has great natural resources."    The visit was also commented on by Alberto Poletto,  president  of the Venezuelan Foreign Trade Institute. In his opinion, the  meeting contributed to increased bilateral commercial relations.    Trade between Venezuela and Brazil amounts to approximately  $800 million, with a $200 million balance in Brazil's favor.    A partial agreement negotiated in 1991, by which Brazil  granted Venezuela preferential taxes for 600 new items, is  currently in force. Venezuela has granted Brazil preferential  taxes for 300 new products. Venezuela purchases 37 percent of  what it purchases from ALADI [Latin American Integration  Association] member countries in Brazil.    During the meeting the presidents raised several  international issues, such as:    -- President Itamar Franco said that Mercosur [Common  Market of the South] can coexist with NAFTA or with the Andean  Pact.    -- Regarding the candidates for OAS secretary general,  Franco commented that "Brazil received a request, which we are  assessing, that this post be occupied by the president of a  certain Republic. We have discussed the issue with the Colombian  Foreign Ministry."    Brazil has already announced its support for Colombian  President Cesar Gaviria. The Venezuelan president said that  Venezuela supports its Foreign Minister Burelli Rivas.    -- Regarding Argentina's purchase of fighter bombers from  the United States, Franco asserted that Brazil does not  interfere in other countries' policies, and that its policy is  one that seeks peace. Caldera noted that Venezuela's stance is  similar to Brazil's. He does not believe there is an ongoing  arms race in Latin America, nor that the United States wants to  promote one.</p>

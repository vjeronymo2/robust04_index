			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with UPTs-KP Church Metropolitan Antoniy </F> (Masendich) by Vasiliy Anisimov, manager of the department of  political research, under the rubric "Expos&eacute;": "The  Repentance of Metropolitan Antoniy"]    [Text] You will not envy Metropolitan Pereyaslav and  Sicheslav Antoniy (Masendich) of the UPTs-KP. A year and a half  ago, as the right-hand man of UAPTs [Ukrainian Autocephalous  Orthodox Church] Patriarch Mstislav, he took part without the  knowledge of the leader of his church in dealings sanctioned by  the ruling nomenklatura--the infamous unification of  the Orthodox churches of Ukraine--and for all that time  steadfastly repelled attacks on its blood offspring, the  UPTs-Kievan Patriarchate [UPTs-KP] and the defrocked monk  Filaret, rescued from political oblivion. The results of the  unification, as should have been expected, were lamentable.  Instead of two Orthodox churches in Ukraine, there have come to  be three. The people did not go to the "unified" church (the  UPTs-KP). UAPTs Patriarch Mstislav, demeaned by state  bureaucrats and betrayed by his former comrades-in-arms, has  died. The autocephalous church itself, which they abolished  without its own knowledge, has come under the repression of the  authorities. The historical Orthodox Church of Ukraine--the UPTs  of Vladimir (Sabodan)--has begun to be blackened in the  presidential/Filaret mass media and on Ukrainian television, and  the search for "traitors," non-patriots and "agents of Moscow"  has started. The heretofore unprecedented stormings of Orthodox  cathedrals by Cossacks and UNSO people have shaken the already  brittle civil peace in Ukraine. The policies of L. Kravchuk and  his team in the field of religion, in short, have led to a  crisis in Ukrainian Orthodoxy and a schism in it. The bishops,  tired of the lies and unreconciled to the role of puppets to  which they have been relegated, have begun to quit the UPTs-KP  (there have already been more than ten). One of the founders of  the Kievan Patriarchate and the business manager of that church,  Metropolitan Antoniy (Masendich), has also finally left.    [V. Anisimov] Archbishop, you are one of the founding  fathers  of the UPTs-KP. Many unpleasant rumors are currently circulating  around the unification of the church, which many, including the  General Procurator of Ukraine, still consider to be illegal...    [Metropolitan Antoniy] I will not conceal the fact that my  departure from the Russian Orthodox Church was dictated by  patriotic aspirations. The programs of the Liberty and Voice of  America radio stations prompted me to that, so that I could  leave for Ukraine. You know my activity of that period. I came  to Bondarchuk, at the time the Metropolitan Ioann (UAPTs). I of  course had the desire to see that the Orthodox Church in Ukraine  became independent. At Bondarchuk's they convinced me that the  episcopal ordinations of his organization were canonical (I  appealed to Metropolitan Andrey and Filaret's now-bishop Daniil  on that score). In coming to the UAPTs, I understood that our  church would have to be in isolation, but I had no doubt that  the Moscow Patriarchate would in time grant autocephaly to the  UPTs, and there would be a unified Orthodox Church in Ukraine in  union with the Russian and other local churches of world  Orthodoxy. Who could suppose that I would become an enemy of the  canonical priesthood in which I served for ten years, and they  my enemies? That has subsequently been a constant source of pain  for me.    I have been able to rise high up the ecclesiastical ladder  of  the UAPTs thanks to Patriarch Mstislav. I did not intend to go  to Kiev, by the way, but the patriarch himself sent me there.    [V. Anisimov] You became the number two person in the UAPTs  and, essentially, have been leading this church in Ukraine?    [Metropolitan Antoniy] Yes. I assumed that I would be able  to  make use of my high position. So as to move closer to the  legitimate Orthodox Church, and seek out ways by which the UAPTs  would gain canonical status. And everything was moving toward  that. But the Metropolitan Filaret was standing in the way. He  was the designated successor of the UPTs at the time, and you  know his sharp statements against autocephaly.    I was on a visited to Kharkov when a report came in that  Filaret had gone into retirement. That was a joyous event, of  course; I called the Council for Religious Affairs and asked  whether it was not time to congratulate the Metropolitan  Vladimir (Sabodan). I assumed that it would be namely he,  enjoying a great reputation within Orthodoxy, who would head the  Ukrainian church. They told me, however, to hold off for the  time being.    Meanwhile Filaret, having promised to retire, changed course  sharply upon his return to Kiev. Rumors moreover began reaching  me that Bishop of our church Vladimir (Romanyuk) had begun  appearing with Filaret. Romanyuk told me that he had discussed  with Filaret questions of bringing the positions of our churches  closer together. But there was no talk of a unification with  Filaret, since I have known him since I had been a cleric of the  RPTs [Russian Orthodox Church] and member of the local synod  that had elected Patriarch of the Russian Orthodox Church  Aleksey II, and I had no illusions with regard to Filaret.    Events, however, had begun to develop rapidly. The UAPTs was  just preparing to celebrate the second anniversary of the synod  that elected Patriarch Mstislav. The patriarch, having blessed  its holding, was not able to attend. I was given authority at  the synod (owing to the absence of the patriarch) to make  decisions at my own discretion, after telephone consultations  with Mstislav. Then I was unexpectedly called by Filaret's  personal assistant, who passed along a request for a meeting. I  went. Filaret was in a terrible fright, since the clergy of the  UPTs had now come to accept the residency of the designated  successor of the UPTs at Pushkinskaya (this was impeded at the  time by the UNSO and the police.--V.A.). I told  Filaret, "If you do not go, they will punish you, take away your  holy office." He brushed it aside: they wouldn't dare to do  that, since the church and many of the higher clergy supposedly  stood behind him. Then Kiev ceremoniously welcomed the new  designated successor of the UPTs Vladimir (Sabodan). His first  service was at the Kiev-Pecherskaya monastery, and I of course  went to the night services. But some monk recognized me and fell  upon me: "You are a schismatic, and there is nothing for you to  do here." That stung me very much. After the service I went by  Vladimir Cathedral. It was closed (the Filaret people were  afraid that the faithful would hand it over to the legitimate  church--the UPTs.--V.A.), but a service was underway.  They met me joyously, to my surprise. Bishop Spiridon announced  straight away that here, as he said, the Muscovites have seized  everything, and therefore we will have an association with the  autocephalous church, which came to us for help. I did not  understand anything. I knew that UNSO had risen in defense of  Filaret, but I did not understand what the UAPTs was doing here.  Spiridon reported that a unification synod had already been  planned, and we would be together. I said "Archbishop, whatever  are you talking about, what unification? I am the metropolitan,  the business manager for the UAPTs, and I don't know anything."  Spiridon answered that Vladimir (Romanyuk) had already agreed on  everything with Filaret. But who is this Romanyuk? He is just a  vicar bishop, and has no right to agree on anything with anyone.  Spiridon came to see me again in the evening at  Trekhsvyatitelskaya, and tried to convince me to meet with  Filaret. I acceded to his request...    Filaret was agitated. I sympathized somewhat: it is hard, I  said, to part with the money, with the exarchate building, the  Vladimir Cathedral. He got right to the point: "If I transfer to  your accounts the money of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, where  is the guarantee that you will not take it?" (four billion  karbovantsi, according to some reports.--V.A.).    I naturally couldn't sleep all night, trying to get in touch  with the Patriarch Mstislav in order to find out how to behave  and what to do. But I couldn't reach him, either at the office  or at home. In the morning, realizing what the consequences of  this action could be, I left the city, having resolved not to  undertake anything without the patriarch. But I was now not able  to avoid it. A delegation appeared in my office at  Trekhsvyatitelskaya: Pavlychko, Chervoniy, Porovskiy, Skorik,  Ternopolskiy etc. They announced immediately that they had been  given the assignment of convening a unification synod of the  UAPTs. You know what events are occurring, we must act  immediately. I was stubborn: I do not have the right to do that,  I said. You must, this is a directive of the President of  Ukraine, was the answer.    [V. Anisimov] You mean to say that the initiator of the  wheeling and dealing for the rescue of Filaret and the donations  of Ukrainian Orthodoxy appropriated by him was Leonid Kravchuk?    [Metropolitan Antoniy] I had a great many doubts on just  that  score myself. They were evidently simply using his name. They  knew, after all, that I wouldn't pick up the phone and call--is  it true, Leonid Makarovich? The deputies, of course, asserted  that all of the higher officials coming out against Filaret  would be removed from their positions. Kolesnik (the Filaret  supporter Zinchenko took his place) and Pilipenko (Procurator  General Shishkin, who had protested the unification synod,  suffered the same fate a year later--V.A.) really did  soon "fall." The deputies moreover promised that the President  would hand over Sofiya Kiev and all the rest to us if we would  accept Filaret. Kravchuk and Filaret are of course linked by 30  years of joint work in the ideological field, and they say that  they are even dacha neighbors (I, by the way, have never had the  honor of being in their company and participating in their  confidential discussions). I nonetheless do not think that the  President has an unequivocal attitude toward the UPTs-KP. I also  consented to unification because the deputies assured me that  Filaret would be in the leadership for only three or four  months, and then they would "carry him off to his rest." It is,  after all, a disgrace even for one's own children to associate  with someone deprived of his holy office and exposed in the  press. Filaret himself said that he would have no claim to  authority in the church, but that means that the opportunity has  appeared before us for negotiations and unification with the  canonical Orthodox Church of Ukraine.    [V. Anisimov] You were not surprised that half of the  deputy-tempters were Greco-Catholics? What relation do they have  to Orthodoxy? Why were they not, say, seeking the unification of  their own church with the Catholic Church in Rome and  independence from the Rome patriarchate?    [Metropolitan Antoniy] That, of course, put me on guard. I  declared that I should consult with the Patriarch Mstislav  (after all, he cannot stand Filaret). Pavlychko snapped that  this was not my concern at all: it would be easier to call the  patriarch from the President's residence and smooth everything  over. What was left for me to do? I promised the deputies I  would report to all the bishops and consult. No, they insisted.  We are going to Filaret right now to coordinate the terms of the  unification and so forth. They had to go. The conversation with  Filaret was reduced to one thing--everyone was in danger. The  Metropolitan Vladimir (Sabodan) is gathering a synod at the  monastery, after which all of the property would pass to the  UPTs. We were thus obliged to outrace them. I was surprised:  "But there are three days left. Who would have time to organize  a synod in that time?" "Convene immediately for Thursday, and  there will be a joint service in Kiev as early as Friday," was  the reply.    That night I tried again to get hold of the patriarch and  even sent him a fax, but there was no answer. Then I called  Archbishop Andrey of Ivano-Frankivsk (headed of the largest  diocese of the UAPTs). I told him that we were being promised  Sofiya and all the rest, and asked for advice. If Andrey had not  supported me, then I would not have risked convening the higher  orders of the clergy. But he said that the patriarch was abroad,  and we evidently had to heed what the deputies were saying. I  called around to the bishops, and called them to Kiev  immediately. But I did not tell them the purpose.    They assembled on Thursday morning (with the exception of  Peter Lviv (who was ill) and Vasiliy Ternopol). The deputies  came as well--aside from the company already mentioned,  Zinchenko came, as well as Viktor Burlakov from Rukh, who today  heads something in the SBU. I was informing the bishops when  Andrey Ivano-Frankivsk suddenly rose and declared  unceremoniously that he would not enter into any unification  whatsoever. Larisa Skorik and Romanyuk pounced on the "striker"  at once: you, they said, are a traitor, an agent of Moscow etc.  But the threats did not have any effect: three bishops--Andrey,  Anatoliy (Fialko) and Nikolay (Grokh)--left the synod right  then. The ill Peter Lviv was represented by Vladimir Yarema. He  went to the synod, which caused a great scandal with Chervoniy.  Had there been no pressure from the deputies, and they were  still there in force, neither I nor the bishops would have gone  for unification for anything. Filaret has moreover asserted that  the UPTs bishops support him. But none of the twelve members of  the higher clergy went for Filaret.    We were to serve in Sofiya on the second day of the synod.  And Filaret suddenly announced that I could not serve with the  bishops of the UAPTs. That is, those that had received and saved  him! Then I had to threaten that I would not only come, but that  I would also report who he in fact was--an ordinary monk.  Filaret, as you know, by the way, had not yet left the  jurisdiction of the Moscow patriarchate. This, I think, is some  latest bit of cunning of his, and there is something behind it.    The deputies now began to pressure Filaret. He boasted, go  ahead, let him call the President, but all the same consented  first to serving at the prayer service, and then the liturgy as  well. That is how the infamous unification occurred. It was, of  course, not legitimate. Our synod, if you go by the charter and  the canons, was not legitimate. It did not lead to a  unification, but rather to an even greater schism. And Filaret  and his deputies are to blame for it. Without them we would have  long ago found common tongue with both Metropolitan Vladimir  (Sabodan) and with world Orthodoxy. I have always had great  respect for both the UAPTs and for Vladimir Yarena (today UAPTs  Patriarch Dimitriy I.--V.A.). The Orthodox would have  lost all their cathedrals in Western Ukraine if there had been  no UAPTs, thanks to which Orthodoxy was preserved in those lands.    [V. Anisimov] But the synod "decided to consider" Mstislav  as  patriarch of the UPTs-KP, and Filaret as his deputy. What were  the relations between them?    [Metropolitan Antoniy] None whatsoever. You understand for  whose sake that was done. The Patriarch could not stand Filaret.  I feel great guilt before Mstislav, who did a great deal of good  for me even though I acted against his will... There was nothing  for me to fear then, of course--go on a boycott. But how could I  act against, as the deputies asserted, the will of the  President? Having come with Filaret from Constantinople, we  should have gone to Mstislav. The deputies, after all, presented  the patriarch with an ultimatum: either you accept Filaret, or  you stay in complete isolation. Mstislav was staying at the  Zhovtneva Hotel at the time, and immediately asked, where is  Antoniy? I was of course afraid to go to him, but I went. I  explained everything, I told him of the President's request, and  he answered, this clears up the picture somewhat, but you  deserve to be punished all the same. I prevailed upon him to  accept Filaret, and he refused point-blank. Chervoniy,  Porovskiy, Skorik came by to see him--for naught. Mstislav  finally softened: he is not against unification, he said, but  what does he need this "deputy" for, that people are laughing at  around the world? Only before his departure was Mstislav  compelled to accept Filaret--they spoke one on one for about  fifteen minutes. When leaving, the patriarch asked that he be  escorted without Filaret. But Filaret went to Borispol all the  same. Their meetings were thus always forced. There was simply  nowhere for Mstislav to go, even though he could not abide  either Filaret or Romanyuk.    [V. Anisimov] But why Romanyuk?    [Metropolitan Antoniy] I do not know, perhaps because of the  undignified behavior of Romanyuk in confinement, there were  stories about him, or perhaps hostility that had arisen back in  America had an effect. The patriarch clapped me on the shoulder  one day and said, "If you want to be my friend, do not mention  Romanyuk to me any more." Romanyuk was in general under some  kind of hypnosis from Filaret; even now, as the patriarch, he  blindly does everything he is ordered.    [V. Anisimov] But why first a locum tenens, and  then namely he elected patriarch?    [Metropolitan Antoniy] When Mstislav died, it suddenly  became  clear that Filaret wouldn't mind taking his place. Zinchenko, it  seemed to me, did not object to that either. I thus had to state  bluntly to the "sullied" claimant: you cannot be a locum  tenens, since Western Ukraine would break away from us  immediately. The faithful and the higher clergy, after all,  could tolerate him as a bishop but in no way consider him a  leader. Filaret never goes to Lvov or Ternopol. The election of  Romanyuk was the sole way out of the situation to preserve the  unity of the UPTs-KP. The deputies nonetheless undertook a  mighty attempt, at the synod, to drag Filaret in as a candidate  for patriarch. Chervoniy, Porovskiy, Skorik et al.  were solidly behind him. I do not want to whitewash the  communist regime, the plenipotentiaries and so on, but I will  say frankly that even the communists did not interfere in the  internal affairs of the church, they did not exert any pressure  on it. Chervoniy stood at one microphone and Porovskiy at the  other at the synod, as if at a session of parliament, and  started a cross fire. Only the d&eacute;marche of the former  UAPTs  bishops (we left the hall) kept them from shoving Filaret into  the patriarchy. They then decided to deal with me at the synod.  Only the protection of Romanyuk, just elected patriarch (he  threatened to pass his patriarch's cowl to the people's  deputies) curbed their zeal. The call of Zhulinskiy, who said  that all--both Romanyuk and I--should remain in their places,  perhaps also played a role.    [V. Anisimov] And can a state of affairs be deemed normal  when the deputies run the church, and calls come from the  President indicating who should stay in what places?    [Metropolitan Antoniy] That is normal here in Ukraine. The  intervention of forces outside the church into church affairs  has crossed all boundaries. The deputies, Zinchenko--they are  constant guests of Filaret, they sit in on holy synods and  essentially run the church, giving commands to the higher  clergy. Zinchenko could even order, say, archbishop Spiridon  removed from Vinnitsa. Filaret is also supported by the "power  structures"--he is a friend of Nedrigaylo, and an even greater  one of Boris Tabachek, a superior of the Vladimir synod. The  police, together with the Filaret people, undertake  storm-trooper type acts against the Kiev-Pechorskaya monastery.    The misfortune of Christianity in Ukraine in general is the  fact that various political forces have seeped into the church,  and each is trying to use its influence on people for its own  ends. The church was not able to dissociate itself from them in  time. As a result the UAPTs has its own politicians, and the  UPTs-KP has its own. This is a tragedy. If all denominations  were to assemble and say, that's enough, let the politicians  engage in politics, the church has its own purpose--to go to the  hospitals, schools, prisons, almshouses, children's homes--then  the church would not be split into pieces, and the stances of  the conflicting sides today would move closer together. That is  just why I left the UPTs-KP: I do not want to be the screen  behind which someone's political capital is accumulated. I  signed some piece of paper at one time for Levka Lukyanenko.  Today Chervoniy, Skorik, Porovskiy, Zinchenko etc. need the  UPTs-KP first and foremost.    [V. Anisimov] You are saying very harsh things. You would  agree that faith is an intimate matter. To get into the souls of  people, to provoke a schism of the Orthodox for the sake of some  "political capital," is just too cynical.    [Metropolitan Antoniy] You see, they will again be put  forward for parliament according to the districts where they  have seized the cathedrals, where the UPTs-KP has support among  the population. Take Ternopolskiy, as far as I know he is being  put forward from Ternopol Oblast... Why, say, are Chervoniy or  Porovskiy not going to Eastern Ukraine? This same Porovskiy,  after all, worked a great deal in Crimea on its Ukrainization.  Why doesn't he stand there? They even lie to their own voters.  Chervoniy, for example, knows that the Rivne area does not  support Filaret. And after the synod, coming to Rivne, he says  to the faithful face to face, you know I voted for Romanyuk at  the synod, but archbishop of Rivne Roman supported Filaret. That  was to discredit the higher clergy in the eyes of the people.  That is even though I will testify that everything was the other  way around--it was precisely Chervoniy himself who insisted on  the candidacy of Filaret. Our tragedy is the fact that  non-church people have attached themselves to the church. They  have nowhere else to go. Both Porovskiy and Chervoniy are former  Komsomol workers, and Zinchenko, as far as I know, got through  the elections in Vinnitsa Oblast on the democratic platform of  the CPSU. The situation changes, what can they do? They wisely  decide to head for the church. And if they had come to the  church with pure feelings, with repentance, that would have been  noteworthy. But they came in order to rule once more, and to  foist their own foolish policies onto the church. I am not sure  that any of them has even read the Bible at all. And the  people's deputies have given the churchmen a thankless role:  exploiting the patriotic feelings of the faithful, creating a  base for the elections by deft parliamentary maneuverings. I am  thus convinced that to remain in this church and lie to the  faithful is a great sin. Filaret receives humanitarian  assistance from the former army of the GDR, he clothes and shods  the Cossacks of Chervoniy, and they storm the cathedrals for  Filaret--there's a good example of mutual support for you. It is  not for nothing that Porovskiy has somehow flattered the  all-powerful Filaret--how I used to hate you, he says! But now I  am ready to get on my knees before you.    [V. Anisimov] And what about UPTs-KP Patriarch Vladimir  (Romanyuk)?    [Metropolitan Antoniy] He has no support among the bishops  with our departure. And Filaret rules the ball. According to  information that is still unverified, he is doing everything to  drive Romanyuk to drink.    [V. Anisimov] But it is no secret, after all, that Romanyuk  loved to drink even when a bishop, is it?    [Metropolitan Antoniy] Unfortunately. But he had a heart  problem after the events in Lutsk, and he limited his use of  spirits. I am for some reason convinced that Romanyuk is  leaving. I respect him as a person who has been persecuted, and  I think that he does not want to dance to Filaret's tune for  very long.    [V. Anisimov] So then why does the UNSO support Romanyuk?    [Metropolitan Antoniy] I must honestly admit that I do not  know, although Romanyuk really does have a great deal of  influence on it.    [V. Anisimov] But after all, you also took part in seizing  cathedrals, for example in Ternopol?    [Metropolitan Antoniy] I am not guilty of the events in  Ternopol, I give you my word. I was talking with the bishops and  clergy at the church when Chervoniy gave the command to the  Cossacks to seize the home of UPTs bishop Sergey. First he  appeared before the clergy with a proposal to organize a  Ternopol Cossack host and announce a collection of funds for  those purposes. Then he went to Sergey, where there were a  bookkeeper, guard and domestics. Then the Cossacks stood up for  the ataman himself. The forces were unequal, and after a small  skirmish the Cossacks drove everyone from the gates. Chervoniy  sent a courier to the autocephalous clergy: come and lend a  hand, he said, we are taking the house for you. I wanted to go  there at once, but my car was blocked. I think that was a  planned provocation against me by Chervoniy, so as to portray me  as a terrorist: wherever Antoniy appears, there is a battle  immediately. The next day the building was returned to the UPTs.    [V. Anisimov] How many parishes are there in the UPTs-KP in  Ukraine today?    [Metropolitan Antoniy] One and a half thousand. This is an  influential organization only in Western Ukraine. If the Kiev  diocese, which numbers some hundred active parishes (another  hundred on paper), leaves the UPTs-KP, then Filaret's church  will simply cease to exist. I feel that a house built on sand  will not last long. Falsehoods and lies will out all the same.  This church will inevitably disintegrate.    [V. Anisimov] So why have you not returned to the UAPTs or  not gone to the UPTs, like the other bishops?    [Metropolitan Antoniy] I studied at a seminary of the  Russian  Orthodox Church, and served as a clergyman in it for ten  years... I returned to the canonical church, far from Filaret  and his intrigues and provocations. I feel that Ukraine will  have its own autocephalous, canonical Orthodox church, and that  will be the UPTs of Metropolitan Sabodan. The church should be  with the people, and if the people have come out for  independence, then their church should also move toward  independence.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Channel Africa Report" program] </F>   [Text] A three-day conference aimed at restructuring South  Africa's security forces has opened in the Zimbabwean capital  Harare. The conference is being attended by senior military and  police personnel and officials of the African National Congress  [ANC] and the Pan-Africanist Congress [PAC]. Trevor Grundy has  the details:    The conference this week is being organized by the Southern  African Peacekeeping and Peacemaking Project, which operates  under the auspices of the Institute of International Education  in New York. The first conference of this kind on South Africa  was held in Harare in June of last year. Over 70 delegates are  attending at the Harare International Conference Center and this  afternoon Justice Richard Goldstone will be talking about the  prevention of public violence and intimidation in South Africa,  before and after the elections. Other contributors will be  General Smit, the deputy commissioner of the South African  Police Force, Chief Superintendent (Peter Stephens) of Scotland  Yard, Lieutenant General Pierre Steyn, the former Chief of Staff  of the SADF [South African Defense Force], Enoch Dambuchena,  Zimbabwe's former chief justice, plus representatives of the ANC  and the PAC.    The conference opened as President Mugabe was meeting  President de Klerk for the first time in Botswana. That meeting  was attended by Defense Minister Moven Mahachi, so in Harare  someone else has to read his speech. Minister Mahachi praised  the SADF, the ANC, and the PAC for making attempts to work  alongside one another to create a national defense force. He  also called on all soldiers in South Africa to be democratic and  fair after, as well as before, the April election. It would, he  said, be a very sad day indeed if the freedom of democratic  processes -- if the South African Defense Forces should be found  rejecting the wishes of South Africans, where the process is  judged to be free and fair by the international community.    In a keynote address the current president of the United  Nations General Assembly warned against widespread violence.  Ambassador Samuel Insanally of Guyana said that the South  African law authorities must begin to deal effectively and  fairly with any threat or disturbance to peace. Deviation at  this stage, he said, would only lead to disaster and plunge  South Africa into what he calls dangerous uncertainty.</p>

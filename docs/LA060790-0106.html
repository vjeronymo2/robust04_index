			<p><P> June 7, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: PASADENA;  </P> <P> REOPENING ENTRANCE AT MUIR  </P> <P> A group of former John Muir High School students and faculty have approached  the Board of Directors for support in reopening the school's front entrance on  Lincoln Avenue.  </P> <P> The entrance was walled off more than 20 years ago to control access to the  school.  </P> <P> Students enter the school through the faculty parking lot on the south side of  the building.  </P> <P> "Reopening the entrance would have a very positive impact on the Northwest  revitalization goals," said Director Rick Cole. He said the closing of the  entrance had been perceived as the school's "turning its back on the  community."  </P> <P> Director Kathryn Nack said the closing "might have been appropriate at that  time, but certainly times are different now."  </P> <P> A decision on the opening would be up to the Pasadena Unified School District  board, but money would probably have to come from the city, Cole said. The  cost, which would include unsealing windows facing Lincoln Avenue, has been  estimated at $230,000.  </P></p>

			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / Management: Flying in the face of corporate ethics BUSINESS school teachers of ethics are an understated bunch. They have to be, otherwise sceptical managers would be even less open to their message: that ethical behaviour is not a burden but a boon to a company's reputation and competitiveness. Yet, on both sides of the Atlantic, the academics' reaction this week to the unfolding implications of British Airways' 'dirty tricks' campaign against Virgin Atlantic has ranged from disappointment to surprise, tinged with a touch of enthusiasm. 'Disappointment that a company in such a leadership position should feel the need to use these tactics,' was the reaction of one American academic. 'Surprise that a company which has invested so much in building a reputation for trusting its staff and caring for its customers should risk that by engaging in such misconduct,' was the comment of another. Their only enthusiasm was at a juicy new research 'case' on ethics. The academics are almost unanimous that the judgment of BA's senior management has not merely been called into question, but that the top is heavily to blame for the affair, regardless of BA's attempted exoneration of its chairman and chief executive. For the members of an organisation to know the difference between acceptable and unacceptable behaviour - which is more than just a matter of knowing the law - the lead has to be set consistently from the top, the academics argue. In the absence of clear indications that particular actions are unacceptable, managers will tend to try to second-guess the top, and act in a way which they think their bosses will approve. As several UK academics suggest, this is especially likely if, as at BA, the head of the organisation has a reputation for muscularity. Surprising though it may seem, behaviour towards competitors - other than anti-trust collusion with them - is one of the least developed areas of the developing discipline of business ethics. Because of the field's roots in religion and moral philosophy, its growth during the 'corporate social responsibility' fashion of the 1970s, and the impetus it has been given by the financial scandals of the 1980s, most research and teaching has concentrated on relations between companies and their most obvious 'stakeholders'. As a result, the vast majority of business ethics literature deals with individual behaviour towards office colleagues and subordinates, and with corporate attitudes to insider trading, to customers (including bribery and product safety), to the local community, to health, safety and the environment, and to political issues such as South Africa. Only recently have relations with suppliers bounced on to the agenda, though more in Europe than the US. Apart from anti-trust considerations, competitor relations - ranging from information-gathering to the way one talks to customers about one's rivals - has rated hardly a mention. The same blind spot applies to companies. 'Very few corporations have addressed the ethics of behaviour towards competitors,' says one of few academics to specialise in the field, Lynn Paine, a professor at Harvard Business School. An analysis she made of the content of American corporate codes of conduct showed that fewer than two dozen out of 480 companies gave any real guidance to employees on methods of gathering competitive intelligence. As a model, Paine and others cite three pages on competitive behaviour taken from a statement of 'standards of business conduct' circulated widely within Hewlett-Packard, the successful - and reputedly ultra-ethical - US electronics multinational. These contrast starkly with BA's alleged behaviour. They include, among other things, a carefully-defined ban on the use of 'improper' means to obtain competitive information, and a rule that any statements about competitors 'must be fair, factual and complete'. Paine's course on 'information, power and responsibility' teaches, among other things, that companies which tell their managers and employees to trust each other, and to tell the truth, should consider the probable internal impact of behaving in a very different fashion when they deal with competitors. 'One likes to think one can put these things into boxes, but I'd question whether one can do so,' says Paine. She also teaches that, in order to improve the products, services and profits of their industry, 'companies should consider what is healthy competition, not just whether one is straying across a legal boundary. The avoidance of wrongdoing is not enough'. Contrary to the way critics paint them, few teachers of business ethics are naive. Most accept that, just as acceptable behaviour varies between countries, it does by industry, according to the impact within that industry of each practice. Standards of acceptability differ, for instance, over the way companies promote their products, gather competitive information and poach key employees. But as one academic said this week: 'There are limits - and they're not just the law.' The same applies to the moot question of whether certain anti-competitor tactics are only acceptable in takeover battles, or when a small company is attacking a near-dominant one. Academics are at one that a respectable Goliath should never use underhand tactics to attack a David, no matter what the circumstances.</p>

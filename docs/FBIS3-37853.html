			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Ilya Bulavinov report: "Russian Military Wary of Boris </F> Yeltsin's Plan for Yugoslavia"]    [Text] In the near future Russia will apparently send an  extra contingent of peacekeeping forces to Bosnia to reinforce  the 400 paratroopers moved from Croatia to Sarajevo. This  matter is currently being discussed by politicians and  diplomats. Meanwhile, the Russian military are growing ever  more wary of various sorts of political agreements and,  according to KOMMERSANT-DAILY reports, from now on they are  intent on assessing the actions by politicians from the point of  view of their readiness to heed the Armed Forces' interests.    Against the backdrop of universal euphoria with regard to  the  truce in the Sarajevo area, Russian servicemen appear to be the  only ones who are not showing any particular pleasure in that  regard. The top brass in Moscow has always been wary of UN  attempts to have Russia enhance its military presence in the  former Yugoslavia. The Defense Ministry is positively certain  that should hostilities resume, under no circumstances will any  Russian officers order shooting on Serbs. Accusations of  supporting "religious brothers" that will be inevitably hurled  against the Russian servicemen following such a refusal would  give NATO a pretext to support the Muslims in response,  something which may cause an escalation of the Yugoslav conflict.    Pavel Grachev has suggested in a telephone conversation with  his U.S. counterpart, William Perry, that the United States send  in its troops to observe the truce from the side of the Bosnian  Muslims. His proposal was effectively turned down  (KOMMERSANT-DAILY reported the talks in yesterday's issue), so  Russia will still have to reinforce its contingent in Sarajevo  unilaterally.    There is yet another reason for the army's reluctance to be  involved in peacekeeping operations. In the Defense Ministry's  view, particular importance should be attached to conflicts  under way near the country's borders on CIS territory.  Currently, over 16,000 Russian servicemen are involved in  efforts to settle them. Unlike the "blue helmets," they have  neither peacekeeping status, nor financial support from  international organizations.</p>

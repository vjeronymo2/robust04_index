			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / US environment plan due today PRESIDENT Bill Clinton is expected to announce today his plan for cutting US emissions of greenhouse gases to meet its pledge under the Rio de Janeiro treaty on global climate change. The plan relies mainly on voluntary measures intended to encourage the use of more energy-efficient cars, lights and other equipment; this would reduce the burning of fossil fuels and so cut emissions of carbon dioxide, the principal greenhouse gas. Employers which provide parking to employees would be required to make an equivalent cash payment to those who use other forms of transport, with the goal of encouraging people not to commute by car and cutting more than 8m tons of carbon dioxide emissions. Mr Clinton's plan also relies heavily on reinforcing sinks such as forests that absorb greenhouse gases, by preserving forests and planting trees. This step is estimated to cut another 8m tons of emissions. None of the measures would cut emissions by nearly as much as Mr Clinton's earlier proposal for an energy tax, which was abandoned in the face of opposition from senators from oil-producing states. In announcing the proposals, Mr Clinton is following up a promise he made this year to commit the US to the target of reining its emissions of greenhouse gases back to their 1990 level by the year 2000. The US alone accounted for around 21 per cent of the world's entire emissions of greenhouse gases. It produced 1.31bn tons of carbon dioxide in 1990, a figure projected to rise over the 1990s without restraining measures by 100m tons. Environmental groups yesterday were reluctant to criticise Mr Clinton's plan, which they said was substantially more specific than the proposals made by former President George Bush, but hoped for improvements over time.</p>

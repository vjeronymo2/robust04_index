			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / Hong Kong stumbles badly in its battle of wills with China: Peking is out-manoeuvring colonial officials over the contentious issue of who will control a proposed Pounds 7bn airport, reports John Elliott HONG KONG is losing on points in a tense diplomatic battle with China over plans to build a HKDollars 100bn (Pounds 7bn) international airport, which Peking is refusing to back until it has achieved extensive control over the project. The British colony is not prepared to concede such control before it returns to Chinese sovereignty in 1997 and it is threatening to shelve the project indefinitely. This is creating uncertainty which is knocking business confidence - yesterday the local stock market plummeted by 2.32 per cent, the biggest fall since the start of the Gulf conflict last August. Hong Kong's colonial government has also lost points recently to China on three other occasions while trying to defend its constitutional rights. The latest occurred yesterday when Mr Gordon Wu, a prominent construction entrepreneur, was invited to Peking for talks on plans drawn up by a group of Hong Kong Chinese property developers to take over the project and finance it themselves for about HKDollars 60bn. Mr Wu's ace card would be to suggest to China that he and the other developers could build the airport rapidly after 1997 if Hong Kong refuses to come to terms in the next few weeks. Infuriated Hong Kong government officials see this as a spoiling tactic at a time when they are trying to persuade China to come to terms. Another loss on points came last week after Hong Kong refused to publicise details of its options for the project, despite considerable local pressure. Top Peking officials provocatively said that they were willing to publish their ideas as soon as Hong Kong agreed, so that local people could judge which alternative they prefer. This led to an outspoken debate in the colony's Legislative Council last Wednesday when legislators turned on Britain and Hong Kong, not China. But perhaps most humiliating of all was a lecture read to Hong Kong officials recently by China about fiscal discipline, control of public borrowings, and maintenance of fiscal reserves. This was not a new line, because China has been arguing that the airport project will drain reserves and weaken the economy before 1997. The humiliation arose because the Chinese, who are not themselves renowned for strong fiscal discipline, read the lecture from Hong Kong's 1979 budget speech delivered by Sir Philip Haddon-Cave, the then powerful financial secretary. The inference was that, in order to build a massive British memorial to over 150 years of colonial rule, Hong Kong's current top officials had over-ridden the strict financial ethics on which the colony had thrived. China acknowledges a new airport is needed to replace existing congested facilities. But it has been objecting to the plans since late 1989, initially for a mixture of political and economic reasons. Now it is seeking a continuing say on the project - for example the right to examine financial borrowing and contract decisions - in addition to having seats on an airport authority board. 'It wants control,' says a senior official. Hong Kong says it is only prepared to consult China. It argues that any further consensus-seeking measures would slow the project and establish a precedent for China to gain virtual control of other medium- and long-term economic and fiscal decisions before 1997. Hong Kong's aim now is to persuade China that it is not bluffing when it says that it would prefer to shelve (or effectively cancel) the project and expand its existing Kai Tak airport. This refusal to give Peking a precedent for control is backed by Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, who failed to reach agreement during a recent visit to Peking and who would have to sanction any final breakdown with the Chinese. The airport is now estimated to cost HKDollars 100bn at 1990 prices and is the world's largest new infrastructure project apart from Gulf reconstruction. Officials had hoped the private sector would finance 40 to 60 per cent of the HKDollars 127bn plans (at 1988 prices) originally announced in 1989, which included linked port developments to be carried out later. Recently it has emerged that the expected private sector element has dropped to only about 25 per cent of the HKDollars 100bn - including bonds, loans, equity stakes and franchises for parts of the airport. But whatever the percentage, the government now believes that China's support is essential. It fears China would attack the project if there were no agreement and that this would scare off financial backers because franchise periods and debt repayments would not start before 1997. It might even deter six pre-qualified international construction consortia which are now waiting to be invited to submit tenders for the Lantau Fixed Link. Business confidence, on which Hong Kong depends, would slump. Politics apart, Hong Kong could build the airport without the private sector. It has HKDollars 75bn of basic fiscal reserves, plus an Exchange Fund which has a secret amount of accumulated investment earnings, believed to be about HKDollars 50bn-70bn (in addition to HKDollars 40bn needed to prop up the currency and about HKDollars 60bn transferred temporarily as investments from the fiscal reserves). Most of the Exchange Fund earnings could be used for the airport, but the government does not regard this as a viable option because it would be strenuously opposed by China and, possibly, by Hong Kong people. So the future of the project before 1997 depends on agreement with China. This is a dramatic turnround from two years ago, when Hong Kong saw no need even to consult Peking fully on the plans. As late as last year top officials were saying they would go ahead on their own if China did not fall into line, using public sources for the bulk of the funds. Hong Kong is learning painfully about China's determination to protect its inheritence over the final six years of British rule.</p>

			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / International Company News: Stroeher family to sell part of Wella holding DESCENDANTS of Mr Franz Stroeher, the founder of Wella, the German personal care products manufacturer, will offer a portion of their stake in the company as common shares on German and Swiss stock exchanges, AP-DJ reports from Darmstadt. The Stroeher family still owns 66.8 per cent of the company's share capital and will offer 20 per cent of their stake - 13.4 per cent of the company - to cover inheritance taxes, Mr Peter Zuehlsdorff, the chairman, said yesterday. The timing of the issue has not been determined. Wella will propose the transformation of registered ordinary stock into ordinary bearer shares at an extraordinary shareholders' meeting. Following this change, the shares would be listed in Frankfurt, Berlin, Vienna, Zurich, Geneva and Basle. Preferred shares, which represent 33.2 per cent of the company's capital, are already traded publicly. An undetermined portion of the newly available common shares would be offered to owners of the company's preferred shares but no price has been set for the shares. No capital increase is planned, Mr Zuehlsdorff said. Wella has previously reported that sales for the first nine months of 1993 were up a sluggish 3.2 per cent over the same period last year. However, Mr Zuehlsdorff said the company expects full-year sales growth to reach 6 per cent, for a total of DM2.9bn, citing a strong increase in recent months. A first-time consolidation of brands acquired from SmithKline Beecham in June will also boost the full-year figure, he added. Mr Zuehlsdorff also said he expects profits for the year to grow more quickly than sales. The company said that two-thirds of the increase in the 1993 dividend would reflect tax changes which have reduced corporation tax. Wella paid a dividend of DM9 a share on ordinary stock on 1992 results and DM10 on preference shares.</p>

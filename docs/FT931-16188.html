			<p>930108 FT  08 JAN 93 / Ofgas attacks British Gas on service charges BRITISH GAS became embroiled in another row with its regulator yesterday when Sir James McKinnon, director-general of Ofgas, accused the company of making big increases in service charges. Sir James said British Gas was trying to claw back the profits it had lost from reduced gas prices by raising service charges by more than the rate of inflation. British Gas has been forced by the regulator to reduce domestic gas prices through a tough new formula. Sir James said: 'A lot of people are getting a Pounds 20 benefit from lower gas prices, but those on British Gas's 3-star service are losing Pounds 10 of that from higher prices.' Mr Simon Kirk, British Gas director of marketing, said there were some 'astonishing' allegations in Ofgas's announcement. He said in an interview on BBC radio that Sir James's allegations were 'scurrilous and irresponsible'. But British Gas said average price rises for servicing across the country had been 7.9 per cent in April last year and admitted that in some regions prices had increased by as much as 11 per cent. 'We're adding value to those service packages at a price we think customers can afford,' a company official said. He added that British Gas's service business has been rising by about 20 per cent a year for the past five years. At the same time, British Gas has only about 25 per cent of that service market. Mr Ian Powe, head of the Gas Consumers' Council, the body which represents customers, said that 18 months ago competitors in the service market were complaining that British Gas was undercutting their prices and that they could not compete. 'Now it is a totally different scene, prices are up and consumers are not doing too well,' he said. Mr Powe said he was completing a review of service and installation charges that will be ready by the end of January. But the Gas Consumers' Council and Ofgas have no powers to act in the service market. Large contracts for the supply of water, gas, electricity, transport and telecommunications services to public networks will have to be advertised in the EC Official Journal under new regulations which come into force on January 13.</p>

			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / UK Company News: English &amp; Overseas recovery ENGLISH &amp; Overseas Properties returned pre-tax profits amounting to Pounds 12,000 for the six months ended June 30 1993. This compared with losses of Pounds 438,000 last time after an exceptional debit of Pounds 659,000. Turnover of the company, which provides development, project and asset management services, doubled to Pounds 1.52m (Pounds 792,000). Mr Jim Clark, chairman and chief executive, stated that market conditions in the first half of the current year had shown an improvement 'for the first time in three years'. During the period the company acquired a portfolio of small investment properties - a new strategy for the company - and secured lettings on all but 5 per cent of available space. Mr Clark stated that a number of acquisitions had been considered but the directors had been unable to agree terms acceptable to the company. He added that he was hopeful 'we will be able to undertake a transaction in the near future which will enable the company to make a quantum step forward with a return to acceptable levels of profitability in the medium term'. Earnings per share were 0.05p, compared with losses of 1.88p.</p>

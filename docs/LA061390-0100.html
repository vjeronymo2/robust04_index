			<p><P> June 13, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF : NO LINK FOUND IN DEATHS, DUMPING OF  CHEMICALS  </P> <P> There is no evidence to support allegations that toxic chemicals dumped at a  Santa Clarita Valley defense plant led to five cancer deaths in a family that  lived nearby, state health officials said Tuesday.  </P> <P> In a new study, the state Department of Health Services said the deaths, which  occurred between 1983 and 1989, may never be explained, but suggested that a  genetic defect could have contributed to four of the deaths.  </P> <P> The study examined the health history of the family of Diane and Robert  Hercules, who moved to Sand Canyon from Culver City in 1979. The family lived  less than a mile away from Space Ordnance Systems, an explosives maker  convicted in 1986 of illegally dumping and storing hazardous chemicals.  </P></p>

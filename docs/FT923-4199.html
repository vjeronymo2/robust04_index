			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Lifting of Malaysian palm oil duty opposed MALAYSIA'S PALM oil refiners have objected to suggestions that the country lift export duties on crude palm oil exports in an effort to increase foreign sales. The Palm Oil Refiners Association of Malaysia said the country should continue to be a crude palm oil refining centre. 'If this suggestion is carried through then many millions of dollars of investments we have made in refining capacity could be lost,' said one refiner. Malaysia, the world's biggest palm oil producer, exports almost all of its palm oil in processed form. For several years the government has imposed a 20 per cent duty on crude palm oil exports in order to encourage downstream processing within the country. Last week Mr Lim Keng Yaik, the Malaysian Primary Industries Minister, confirmed that Malaysia now had excess palm oil refining capacity and needed to reconsider its marketing strategy. 'I am thinking out loud whether, at the present stage of development, we still need to go into value added, downstream refining of crude palm oil when it is no longer very profitable,' he said. Malaysian refineries now have a processing capacity of 10m tonnes a year while supply is a little over 6m tonnes. Several countries impose substantial import taxes on processed palm oil whereas crude palm oil is subject to little or no import duties. Mr Lim said processing companies should be encouraged to set up refineries overseas as part of a strategy to build up new markets and gain greater market share in other countries. He has also said Malaysia is considering offering more countries credit facilities for palm oil imports. So far Pakistan and Algeria have signed credit agreements with Malaysia covering a total of Dollars 150m worth of palm oil imports. The government-owned State Trading Corporation of India has signed a contract with Indonesia for the import of 150,000 tonnes of palm olein (the liquid portion), writes Kunal Bose in Calcutta. As the contract has been agreed so soon after India signed a memorandum of understanding with Malaysia covering the purchase of 300,000 tonnes of palm oil in the next two years, it is understood to be expecting a good price discount from the Indonesian suppliers. The contracted Indonesian oil will be arriving next month for distribution through 'fair price' shops. October being the festival month in India, there is a surge in demand for edible oils and the proposed import from Indonesia will help in keeping the oil prices in check.</p>

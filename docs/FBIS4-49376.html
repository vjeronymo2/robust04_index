			<p>BFN     [Text] London, May 4 (XINHUA) -- The U.S. and Russia today  called for a foreign ministerial meeting of the newly-formed  contact group as soon as possible to give "a new powerful  political impetus" to Bosnian peace negotiations.    The meeting of the U.S., Russian, French, British and German  foreign ministers is expected to take place in Geneva on May 13,  U.S. State Department spokesman Mike McCurry said in a statement  after U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher met Russian  Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev in Cairo where they attended the  signing ceremony of Israel-PLO peace agreement on Palestinian  self-rule in Gaza and Jericho.    Christopher and Kozyrev "expressed serious concern over the  continuing instability of the situation in Bosnia which could  spark another dangerous point of conflict," McCurry said aboard  Christopher's aircraft from Cairo to Washington, which stopped  in Ireland to refuel.    The two ministers urged Bosnian Muslims and Serbs to cease  hostilities and rEsume negotiations without preconditions on an  overall peaceful settlement.    They also called for immediate steps to prevent offensive  military action in the Serb-held Brcko area of northern Bosnia.    Christopher, aboard his aircraft, said he supported  deployment of UN troops to Brcko to head off an impend)ng major  battle between Muslim and Serb armies for a vital Serb supply  corridor on which the town lies.    The contact group was established last month to put together  diplomatic efforts of the U.S., Russia, the European Union and  the United Nations to end the two-year-old Bosnian conflict.</p>

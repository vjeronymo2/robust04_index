			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / Letter: Mercedes-Benz an example to banks on cost-cutting Sir, According to your article, 'Making the leap out of the lap of luxury' (January 30), Helmut Werner, the new boss of Mercedes-Benz, indicated that the days are gone when the charging of premium pricing could cover up for costs that were too high. Perhaps, in another context, the spokeswoman from one of the banks who said that they were losing money on any current account with a credit balance of less than Pounds 1,000 should be introduced to this line of conjecture. Banks have lived too long in a world where the answer to corporate happiness was to divide extant costs by the number of transactions and use the product of that equation as the basis for the price the customer should bear. A hard look at the levels of waste of time, effort, resources and money involved in their calculation of costs might be a productive place for them to start rebuilding their justifiably tatty image.

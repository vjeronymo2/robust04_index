			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / Indicators suggest upturn may falter Hints that the economic recovery may falter towards the end of the year came yesterday with the publication of Central Statistical Office figures showing a fall in its economic cyclical indicators. The shorter leading index, which predicts economic turning points about five months in advance, fell for the third month in a row after rising continuously in 1993. The CSO said the fall was caused by a drop in share prices and weak results from a recent consumer confidence survey. The index, calculated from a basket of economic indicators including consumer credit figures, registrations of new cars, share prices and business surveys, has proved only partially accurate in the past. But yesterday's figures were consistent with trends in the other CSO indices. The longer leading index, which attempts to predict turning points 13 months in advance, fell for the third month in a row after remaining broadly flat in the second half of last year. The main reason for the fall was a decline in business optimism found by the Confederation of British Industry's April survey, the CSO said. The longer leading index is compiled from economic indicators which include interest rate levels, housing figures, yield curves and financial deficit figures. The coincident index, which measures current turning points, also fell fractionally in March after rising steadily during the previous 18 months.</p>

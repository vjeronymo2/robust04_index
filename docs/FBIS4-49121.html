			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Sofia Wu] </F>   [Text] Taipei, May 2 (CNA) -- President Li Teng-hui will  start his 13-day, four-country overseas tour Wednesday [4 May]  with an aim toward promoting Taiwan's relations with its allies.    The tour will take Li to Nicaragua, Costa Rica, South Africa  and Swaziland, all of which maintain close official relations  with the Republic of China [ROC].    President Li will sign joint communiques with Nicaraguan,  Costa Rican and Swazi presidents pledging to continue  strengthening bilateral relations, the ministry of foreign  affairs said Monday.    Li is scheduled to arrive in Managua, Nicaragua on  Wednesday,  (local time) for a two-day visit, the ministry said. The  Nicaraguan Government will give Li a 21-gun salute.    Li will deliver a speech to the Nicaraguan Congress on  Thursday, and the congress will confer a medal to Li in  recognition of his contribution to promoting ROC-Nicaraguan  relations. Li will be the fourth recipient of such an honor.    Li will then fly to Costa Rica on Friday for a three-day  visit. While there, he will attend the inauguration of  President-Elect Jose Maria Figueres, which is scheduled to take  place on Sunday. While there, Li will visit an export  processing zone Taiwan's BES Engineering Corp. has built to  attract Taiwan investment to the Central American country.    Li will then proceed to South Africa, where on may 10 he  will  attend the inauguration of the new South African president.  African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela is widely  believed to have won that country's first multiracial  presidential election.    The Foreign Affairs Ministry said it is arranging for  meetings between Li and South African leaders, including Mandela  and incumbent President F.W. de Klerk.    Li will fly to Swaziland May 12 for a state visit. In  addition to meeting with Swazi King Mswati III, he will also  visit a demonstration farm and a handicraft center that the ROC  has helped establish there.    Li and his entourage are scheduled to return to Taipei May  16.    This will be Li's first official overseas tour since he  assumed the presidency in 1988. He made unofficial visits to  Singapore in 1989 and to the Philippines, Indonesia and Thailand  in February this year. All four Southeast Asian countries  recognize Beijing, while maintaining close economic ties with  Taiwan.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Applicants request the ability to waive or reduce the CDSC (a) on redemptions following the death or disability, as defined in section 72(m)(7) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the ``Code''), of a shareholder if redemption is made within one year of death or disability of a shareholder; (b) in connection with distributions permitted to be made under the Code without penalty from an individual retirement account or other qualified retirement plan, other than tax-free rollovers or transfers of assets; (c) in connection with redemptions of shares purchased by active or retired officers, directors or trustees, partners and employees of the Funds, the distributor or affiliated companies, by members of the immediate families of such persons, by dealers having a sales agreement with the distributor, or any trust, pension, profit sharing plan for the benefit of such persons; (d) on redemptions by New York Life or an affiliate thereof; (e) in connection with redemptions of shares made pursuant to a shareholder's participation in any systematic withdrawal plan adopted by a Fund; (f) in connection with redemptions by accounts established with an initial purchase order of $1 million or more; (g) in connection with redemptions effected by separate accounts or advisory accounts managed by New York Life or an affiliated company; (h) in connection with redemptions by tax-exempt employee benefit plans resulting from the adoption or promulgation of any law or regulation pursuant to which continuation of the investment in the Funds would be improper; (i) in connection with redemptions effected by registered investment companies by virtue of transactions with a Fund; (j) in connection with redemptions by any state, county, or city, or any instrumentality, department, authority or agency thereof and by trust companies and bank trust departments; (k) on redemptions made for the purpose of funding a loan to a participant in a tax-qualified retirement plan permitted to make such loans; (1) on transfers to (i) other funding vehicles sponsored or distributed by New York Life or an affiliated company or (ii) guaranteed investment contracts, regardless of the sponsor, within a retirement plan; (m) on redemptions made to meet required distributions by a charitable remainder trust under section 664 of the Code; and (n) on redemptions by living revocable trusts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants' Legal Analysis <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Applicants request an exemption under section 6(c) of the Act from sections 18(f)(1), 18(g), and 18(i) of the Act to issue multiple classes of shares representing interests in the same portfolio of securities. Applicants believe that any implementing the multiple class distribution system, the Funds would be able to facilitate the distribution of their shares and provide a broad array of services without assuming excessive accounting and bookkeeping costs. Applicants also believe that the proposed allocation of expenses and voting rights in the manner described above is equitable and would not discriminate against any group of shareholders. The proposed arrangement does not involve borrowings, and does not affect the Funds' existing assets or reserves. The proposed arrangement also will not increase the speculative character of the shares of a Fund. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Applicants also request an exemption under section 6(c) from sections 2(a)(32), 2(a)(35), 22(c), and 22(d) of the Act and rule 22c&hyph;1 thereunder permitting applicants to assess and, under certain circumstances, waive a CDSC on redemptions of shares. Applicants submit that their request permits shareholders purchasing a class of shares subject to a CDSC to have the advantage of greater investment dollars working for them from the time of their purchase of shares of the Funds than if a sales load were imposed at the time of purchase. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants' Conditions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants agree that any order granting the requested relief shall be subject to the following conditions: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Multiple Class Distribution System <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Each class of shares will represent interests in the same portfolio of investments of a Fund, and be identical in all respects, except as set forth below. The only differences between the classes of shares of a Fund relate solely to: (a) The method of financing certain Class Expenses, which are limited to (i) transfer agency fees identified by the transfer agent as being attributable to a specific class of shares; (ii) printing and postage expenses related to preparing and distributing materials such as shareholder reports, prospectuses, and proxies to current shareholders of a specific class; (iii) blue sky registration fees incurred by a class of shares; (iv) SEC registration fees incurred by a class of shares; (v) the expense of administrative personnel and services as required to support the shareholders of a specific class; (vi) litigation or other legal expenses relating solely to one class of shares; and (vii) directors'/trustees' fees incurred as a result of issues relating to one class of shares; (b) expenses assessed to a class resulting from 12b&hyph;1 and Administrative Services Payments; (c) voting rights as to matters exclusively affecting one class of shares, except as provided in condition (5) below; (d) exchange features; (e) conversion features; and (f) class designation differences. Any additional incremental expenses not specifically identified above which are subsequently identified and determined to be properly allocated to one class of shares shall not be so allocated until approved by the SEC pursuant to an amended order. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

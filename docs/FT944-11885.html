			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / Burma's junta defiant as US presses for reform The most senior US delegation to visit Burma in six years left Rangoon yesterday without apparently receiving any assurance from the country's military rulers that they intend to embark on significant political reforms. Mr Thomas Hubbard, US deputy assistant secretary of state for east Asian and Pacific affairs, said in Bangkok after the two-day visit that moves by the junta towards political reconciliation would improve US-Burmese relations, but failure to make progress 'would lead to further restrictions on our political and economic ties'. Mr Hubbard, accompanied by US officials from the National Security Council and agencies concerned with human rights and drug trafficking, had three hours of talks with Lt Gen Khin Nyunt, head of military intelligence. The US visit follows two meetings between Gen Khin Nyunt and Ms Aung San Suu Kyi, the democracy campaigner held under house arrest in Rangoon for more than five years. Few details of those meetings have emerged, and Mr Hubbard said Gen Khin Nyunt did not divulge any details; nor has the junta let the US delegation meet her or other political prisoners. Burma's armed forces have been in power since 1962. They crushed a popular uprising in 1988, and ignored the results of an election in 1990 which Ms Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy won overwhelmingly. The US has pursued a policy of isolating the junta, downgrading its diplomatic ties and preventing the disbursement of aid funds from multilateral bodies such as the World Bank. 'We would like to see a genuine national reconciliation,' said Mr Hubbard. 'We hope it won't be necessary to downgrade our relationship further.' The US officials were subjected to a long lecture by Gen Khin Nyunt about Burmese history since the time of British colonial rule, and they in turn lectured the general about the need for moves towards democracy. It emerged from the meeting that the International Committee of the Red Cross would soon be allowed 'a role with regard to political prisoners', that Gen Khin Nyunt had promised to continue talks with Ms Suu Kyi, and that the junta had authorised a survey of Burma's opium crop, which accounts for much of the world's heroin supply.</p>

			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Tropical timber 'bashers' attacked MR LIM Kem Yaik, Malaysia's minister of primary industries, yesterday attacked importing countries for 'bashing' tropical timber exporting countries for their own ends. He said that those who criticised tropical countries should show goodwill and patience. Speaking at the opening here of the 12th meeting of International Tropical Timber Organisation, Mr Lim called for an end to unilateral decisions to boycott the purchase of tropical wood by national governments and individual organisations. He cited the plight of Sarawak, Malaysia, where decisions to reduce tropical logging by 1.5m cubic metres in 1992 and similar amount in 1993 in response to ITTO recommendations had meant the loss of 26,000 jobs and USDollars 50m. Producer and consumer country members of the ITTO are divided over the future role of the organisation. Mr Lim restated his views that trade in timber from temperate forests should be considered alongside tropical interests. He said he wanted to see the present renegotiation of the International Tropical Timber Agreement expanded to include all world forests. With less than 10 per cent of world international trade being in tropical wood and the rest of temperate origin, the minister said that the new agreement, scheduled to be in place by March 1994, should widen its scope. But tropical timber importing countries do not agree. Mr Menzo Baratini, spokesman for the European Community, pointed out that the ITTO was set up specifically for tropical timber and had developed principles and strategies aimed at ensuring sustainable management of tropical forests by the year 2000. The system of annual national reporting on progress toward sustainable management of productive tropical forests should be standardised, he said, adding that ITTO's real objectives should be in the field of trade. The ITTO meeting takes place against a background of steeply rising prices for tropical timber from Asia Pacific sources. Sawn wood and plywood prices have leapt 40 per cent over recent months as log production and export in the Sabah and Sarawak States of Malaysia have fallen in response to moves to conserve forest resources in terms of sustainability and industrial requirements.</p>

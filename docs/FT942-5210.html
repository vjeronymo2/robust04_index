			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / Reluctant to give up its grip: Stefan Wagstyl explains why India's government is only slowly shaking up state-owned industries In the control room of the Hindustan Fertiliser plant at Haldia near Calcutta three men watch dials for eight hours a day. When they are finished, another shift of men in grey uniforms takes over, and then another, keeping watch 24 hours a day - just as they might in any other modern chemicals plant. Except that at Haldia the plant produces nothing. It has produced nothing since attempts to commission the state-owned complex failed in 1986 because of fundamental design flaws. Needles on control room dials never move. Some 1,550 people report for work at Haldia. There is a canteen, a personnel department, and an accounts department. There are promotions, job changes, pay rises, audits and in-house trade unions. Engineers, electricians, plumbers and painters maintain the equipment with a care that is almost surreal. Signs are freshly-painted, the roads swept and the grass verges cut. The absurdity of their position has driven some workers to mental illness. Many workers have been idle so long they have become unemployable. The origins of Haldia's failure lie mainly with Mrs Indira Gandhi's ill-conceived pursuit of economic self-sufficiency in the 1970s: the complex was built by inexperienced Indian engineers with an inadequate budget and with insufficient expert foreign supervision. But the fact that Haldia, which loses about Rs150m (Pounds 3.2m) a year, has been allowed to survive until the mid-1990s is also a telling criticism of the present government's reluctance to deal with the legacy of the past. With prime minister Mr P V Narasimha Rao's economic liberalisation programme now in its third year, there is still little sign that he will drastically overhaul the country's bloated publicly-owned industries through rationalisation, privatisation or the rapid introduction of competition into state-run monopolies. The main reason the government fears to act is that serious reform would mean deep job cuts. India's labour laws give workers an almost impregnable defence against compulsory dismissal. The insolvency laws are so restrictive that it takes an average of over 10 years to liquidate a company. A serious attempt to tackle the labour or insolvency laws would be seen as an attack on jobs - so Mr Narasimha Rao is understandably reluctant to act, particularly with the 1996 general election on the political horizon. Moreover, full-scale privatisation would destroy the network of patronage which politicians have built throughout the public sector. While the government is selling shares in 31 state companies, it is committed to retaining 51 per cent and managerial control. Similarly, where private companies are being permitted to enter markets dominated by state monopolies, there is much foot-dragging and back-sliding. Mr Manmohan Singh, the reform-minded finance minister and his supporters in the government, know what needs to be done - but the prime minister will not let them act for fear of political turmoil. To be fair, the prime minister's quiet approach has yielded some results. The government has introduced voluntary retirement schemes which are slowly reducing employment. Total employment in the 237 centrally-controlled industrial enterprises (excluding state-owned banks and services such as telecommunications) has dropped from 2.23m in the late 1980s to under 2m. Government subsidies are also falling, though more slowly than planned. Mr Manmohan Singh intended to eliminate public financial support for loss-makers from April 1994. But when the 1994-95 budget was published it contained another cash injection: Rs6.3bn altogether. Privatisation may be half-hearted but the entry of strong state-run companies into the stock market has encouraged investment, including foreign portfolio investment. It was not a private company but the government's Videsh Sanchar Nigam, India' international telecommunications monopoly, which attempted the country's largest Euroissue - USDollars 1bn. The offer had to be postponed because of the turmoil in world stock markets earlier this year - but the group is considering a second bid later this year. Perhaps the government's biggest success in public sector reform has been in shaking up domestic air travel by permitting the entry of private operators in late 1992. Their competition has forced great improvements in time-keeping and quality from Indian Airlines, the state-owned carrier. But when it comes to other industries, the interests of consumers seem to be of little account. Indeed, for some government ministers, the fact that the launch of private air lines has been accompanied by some teething troubles, including strikes, poaching of staff and arguments over routes, is taken as a reason for treading carefully in other markets. Private investment is being allowed in power generation but competition from private stations will have little effect on existing state-run plants. Moreover, private companies are mostly being kept out of electricity distribution, where political patronage is pervasive. Dispensing cheap power to privileged groups such as farmers is a right few politicians will abandon lightly. Mr Rao argues that by deregulating the economy, including liberalising foreign trade and investment, he has created more than enough opportunities for private companies without the need for upheavals in the public sector. But poorly-performing public enterprises impose a heavy burden on the rest of the economy, not only by siphoning public funds but also by often providing high-cost, low-quality goods and services. As Mr Aditya Birla, head of a leading business grouping, says: 'If the public sector is not competitive, then we can't be either.' People suffer as well as companies. Legal job protection extends only to workers in the public sector and in large privately-owned enterprises - about 30m people, or 150m with their families out of a total population of 890m. The economic cost of providing the safeguards falls on other Indians, many of them very poor and permanently jobless. State-owned units still dominate transport, telecommunications, banking, oil, electric power and other basic services. They are also important producers of raw materials. Of the the central government's 237 active industrial enterprises, 104 lost a total of Rs39.5bn in the year to March 1993. The profits of most of the rest were inadequate - the total return on capital was just 2.4 per cent. Hand-outs for loss-making public enterprises contribute to government borrowing helping to raise the fiscal deficit last year to 7.3 per cent of GDP. Further support comes from state-controlled financial institutions in low-cost loans. Also, even though the government has cut import duties and relaxed internal price controls, the remaining protection is biased towards protecting public enterprises. Some state concerns perform well, despite the uncompetitive environment. Bharat Heavy Electrical, India's dominant maker of generating equipment, has won export orders, so has the Steel Authority of India, the steelmaker. Others could join them if they were free to compete, cut costs and run themselves independently. But Delhi's influence over senior appointments is stifling - Air India, the international carrier, is one of about 10 big enterprises currently without a chairman because politicians and bureaucrats cannot agree on a candidate. Nevertheless, some enterprises are beyond redemption: obsolete textile mills, steelworks and bicycle factories as well as fertiliser plants, including Haldia. The latter is a unit of Hindustan Fertiliser Corporation, which is one of 49 centrally-run public enterprises referred to the government's Board for Financial and Industrial Reconstruction, the agency established to expedite restructuring or liquidation. But only one public, centrally-run enterprise has ever been recommended for liquidation. The government hopes that it will avoid big closures until the newly-liberalised economy grows fast enough to absorb the unemployed - perhaps in the late 1990s. Even then, ministers will bite the bullet only under pressure. As Mr P B Krishnaswamy, secretary of the fertilisers ministry whose responsibilities include Haldia, says: 'This kind of picnic should not be allowed to go on for ever. But things won't change in this country unless it's the hard way, through sheer economic compulsion. Until then, politicians will keep making statements and keep alive the hopes of the dead.'</p>

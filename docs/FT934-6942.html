			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / Papandreou's man becomes bank governor Greece's socialist government yesterday appointed Mr Ioannis Boutos, a former economy minister, as governor of the central bank, writes Kerin Hope in Athens. The move appeared to signal that plans to make the Bank of Greece independent next year have been shelved. Mr Boutos, 68, has no banking experience but has close political ties with the prime minister Mr Andreas Papandreou. He succeeds Mr Efthymios Christodoulou who resigned last week.</p>

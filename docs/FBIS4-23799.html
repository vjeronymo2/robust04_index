			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Address by President Nelson Mandela in Soweto on 16 June; </F> issued on the SAPA PR Wire Service]    [Text] Master of ceremonies, honourable ministers of the  government of national unity, honourable provincial premiers and  cabinet members, leaders of political parties, leaders of the  various youth organisations, comrades, and friends:    When the tragic events of 16 June 1976 erupted in Soweto,  the  question posed itself to the whole of South Africa: So whereto  now?    In the sacrifices that were borne by Hector Peterson and  many  other young people, there seemed to lie an answer. That the  destiny of the youth was the grave and the hangman's noose,  detention and long terms of imprisonment, exile and banishment.    That is what those who arrogated to themselves the status of  slave-master sought to achieve. In the false comfort of their  ill-gotten power, they convinced themselves that the answer to  South Africa's problems was to murder, to maim and to persecute.    But they had typically closed their eyes to the historical  truth that it is a God-given right that the slave should revolt.  To the question, so whereto now, the answer of the youth and  people of South Africa was: to battle, to struggle, to more  bravery.    Today, we mark the 18th anniversary of June 16th as a free  people, proud and full of joy for taking the resistance of that  generation and others before and after it to its final  conclusion.    Yet we mark this day also with a feeling of sadness: that  the  thousands who deserve to be here with us today are no more. We  salute them all.    We commemorate this day, not with the song of defiance on  our  lips. This is no longer a day of protest by an excluded  majority.    We have elected a government of our choice, at the head of  which is the African National Congress.    The brave young people of that generation are today eminent  premiers, ministers and members of national and provincial  parliaments. They are taking their rightful place in the ranks  of the new South African National Defence Force and other  institutions of state and civil society.    Our presence together here--as representatives of the  government of national unity, various political parties, youth  organisations and structures of workers and  communities--symbolises the fact that this is truly a national  day.    The government is reviewing all South Africa's holidays, to  ensure that our calendar is reflective of the total experience  of all the people. And to us it is patently clear what the  mandate is from this gathering and many others throughout the  country. With regard to today, in particular, we urge that  employers honour agreements with workers regarding June 16th as  a paid holiday.    But we would be misrepresenting the sentiments of the class  of '76 if our only concern was that this day should be declared  a national holiday.    Rather, we should first and foremost, approach it from the  point of view that the heroes of those struggles had a noble  mission. They were inspired by a thirst for knowledge: knowledge  which knows no colour; knowledge acquired through persuasion and  hard work; knowledge that taps talents and releases creative  energies; and knowledge that puts South African youth on par  with the best in the world.    As we enter the new and glorious epoch that June 16th helped  to usher in, we will do well to emulate that heroism and turn it  into an asset for the tasks that lie ahead.    We have achieved our freedom. But formal liberation will be  an empty shell if we do not immediately start addressing the  social conditions bred by apartheid. The Reconstruction and  Development Programme must be implemented without delay.    It is therefore fitting that youth organisations of various  persuasions have adopted the theme: youth united for  reconciliation, education and development - as an embodiment of  the spirit of this commemoration. We also acknowledge the  presence in our midst of eminent representatives of the United  Nations International Children's Education Fund; and express our  confidence that your presence in our country will, in more ways  than one, assist our programmes to improve the conditions of our  youth.    The government is convinced that among the first challenges  that we need to address in this regard is to inculcate the  culture of learning and teaching in all schools.    No matter what the origins of the profound education crisis  might be, the fact is that this has become our collective  heritage. We are no longer petitioners, exerting pressure from  the sidelines. We have to roll up our sleeves and together  tackle the problems.    I am personally encouraged by reports of a return to  normality in the schools, since the elections. This does show  the commitment on the part of teachers and students to expend  their energies in ensuring that we truly become masters of our  own destiny.    The problems wrought by apartheid education have lately been  compounded by such terrible tendencies as the proliferation of  criminal gangs, weapons and drugs in some of our schools. This  cannot be allowed to continue. All-round discipline, within an  education strategy involving all players, is fundamental to the  solution of these problems.    In order to address the root causes of the education crisis,  we intend to table a bill in Parliament soon, to eradicate  discrimination and take the first major steps towards ten years  of free quality education.    For these changes to be effective, there has to be close co-  operation between government and organisations of teachers,  students, parents, workers and the business community. The task  to make South Africa a learning and learned nation belongs to  all of us.    The culture of teaching and learning means also that there  should be a culture of rights in the schools. Teachers deserve  to be treated with respect by students, society and government.  In turn, they will enjoy such respect if they act responsibly,  appreciating the central position that their fraternity occupies  in society.    With regard to this year in particular, we fully support the  initiatives to make up for the time lost during recent national  events. We hope that the intensive learning effort will  constitute the beginning of a nation-wide and continuing  campaign.    The opening of doors to the world offers more than just new  opportunities for the youth. It is also a great challenge for  us to improve our standards to match those of other nations.    I wish to use this opportunity to send out an invitation to  the youth of our country to be a full part of the exciting  transformation that we are engaged in. The government is  involved in discussions with different youth organisations on  how they can best make their contribution to the nation-building  and development effort.    During the address at the opening of the last session of  Parliament, we announced the decision to establish a national  youth commission. We have now gone a step further and  established a cabinet committee on youth under the supervision  of minister of sport and recreation. We further wish to welcome  the progress being made by the youth formations towards the  setting up of a youth parliament in the form of the national  youth council.    In these endeavours, political youth organisations in  particular need to address the problem of their functioning  simply as duplicates of their mother bodies. Needless to say,  what is needed are creative programmes which promote the  interests of all youth and involve African, coloured, indian and  white youth in so far as government is concerned, the aim is not  to attend to the youth as if you were some separate and special  species from outer space. Our central approach is to ensure  that young people are fully integrated into the social, economic  and political life of society.    Our policies must turn into reality the principle that every  child deserves to have a decent home and be brought up in the  loving care of a family. The terrible legacy of street children  has to be attended to with urgency. A collective effort has to  be launched by the government, civil society and the private  sector to ensure that every child is looked after, has  sufficient nutrition and health care. The government has  already started taking steps in this regard.    We have, further, taken steps to ensure that within the  shortest possible time, we empty our jails of children. The  process of finding alternative centres for them is under way.    Personally, I regard this as an urgent priority. In a humble  attempt to contribute to this effort, I am consulting with  relevant individuals and bodies, for me to set up a presidential  trust fund representative of people beyond the ANC and the mass  democratic movement, to specifically deal with the problems of  street children and detainees. I intend to make a contribution  of R150,000 [rand] a year to this fund - irrespective of the  decision that Parliament will make about the salaries of elected  representatives. Further details will be announced in due  course.    The fund I have referred to will assist in alleviating these  problems. But I do recognise, as all of you do, that a lasting  solution lies in comprehensive socio-economic upliftment  programmes. At the same time, the youth, especially from  disadvantaged communities, need to realise that we cannot rely  only on governmental programmes and charity. We also have to  take initiatives in our communities to pool our meagre resources  for projects such as bursaries and skills upgrading.    One of the most important problems facing the youth and  society is the AIDS epidemic. We can no longer afford to hide  behind tradition and embarrassment, pretending that this problem  does not exist. To do so is to consign our nation to certain  disaster. We need to join hands now to ensure that the  campaigns launched make the maximum impact.    It serves no purpose to continue blaming the past for these  problems, including drug trafficking, gangsterism and violence.  We must all take responsibility by tackling the root causes at  the same time as we ensure effective law-enforcement.    The security forces, working hand-in-hand with communities,  have an enormous role to play in this regard.    The responsibility of maintaining public safety and security  is not one of the police alone. The people more especially the  youth should take an active part in the police-community forums  that are being set up across the country. And, together, we  must transform the institutions of security to become servants  of the people.    For this reason, we should all condemn in the strongest  terms  the shooting and killing of policemen and women.    In addition, our communities cannot allow a situation in  which young men and women continue to harass communities and  butcher one another in the name of community self-defence.    We are convinced that there are many cadres of integrity in  self- defence units who have played a crucial role in times of  need. But the true measure of their integrity has been  displayed in their co- operation with community structures to  implement a programme that will see to their return to school,  integration within the security forces or participation in  skills-upgrading. Those who defy these programmes cannot  justifiably claim to act on behalf of the community or expect  community protection for their evil deeds.    I call on all youth to join us in the effort to build peace  and reconciliation in our land.    The government of national unity is on course and all the  participating organisations are co-operating well. As  demonstrated at the OAU summit from which we have just returned,  we are, as a nation, making a tremendous impact on the continent  and the entire world.    The manner in which the youth co-ordinating structures have  organised this event is a clear statement to the nation and the  world, that the youth is committed to the healing of the wounds  of the past.    With you, we say to all South Africa's youth, black and  white, including those in the army and police: June 16th is  your day. You might have been on the other side of the dividing  line of apartheid. But now is the time to join the majority in  building a new and glorious future for our country and all its  people.    There is nothing to fear from democracy. The African  National Congress seeks no retribution. Our message of  reconciliation is inspired by a genuine love for our country.  When we call for the truth we do so in order to ensure that all  of us come to terms with the past. So that we can bury those  evil experiences secure in the knowledge that future generations  will recoil from any temptation to repeat them.    Let us all rise to the challenge of the freedom that we have  won. That challenge is to create a better life for all South  Africans: to create jobs, to provide free quality education and  open up opportunities for skills training, to build houses, to  provide health facilities and other basic services.    Let us together answer the question, so whereto now, with a  new youthful determination to learn, to build and to live life  to the full. The country thirsts for your talents and energy.    Together, let us get South Africa working! Thank you.</p>

Grishin said that first vice-prime minister Oleg Soskovets  will substitute for the premier for the duration of his two-week  vacation which he will spend in the Black Sea resort city of  Sochi.    The spokesman said that until the last minute it was not  clear whether or not Chernomyrdin will take his leave now,  mainly because of his active involvement in the work on the  package of economic decrees aimed at continuing economic reforms  in russia. The first package was recently signed by president  Boris Yeltsin.    Grishin denied reports that Chernomyrdin would work on his  book during his vacation. "There will be simply no time left for  that. Besides, he needs rest too," he said.</p>

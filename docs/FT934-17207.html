			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / International Company News: Norwegian groups to merge helicopter units TWO NORWEGIAN groups plan to merge their helicopter activities to operate what is claimed to be the world's most modern twin-engined transport helicopter fleet, with estimated combined 1993 revenues of NKr1.5bn (Dollars 205.5m). Ludvig G. Braathens Rederi, which operates domestic and European airline services, and Helikopter Service, the Stavanger-based helicopter operator, said that they intended to merge, but they did not say when the merger would take effect. The value of the new company, Braathens Helikopter, has been assessed at NKr225m under the deal. The two companies, with a combined workforce of 900, achieved estimated pre-tax profit of NKr23m for the first seven months of this year. Color Line, the Norwegian cruise and ferry group, reported that eight-month interim pre-tax profits had slipped to NKr104m from NKr132m, in spite of a better-than-expected summer travel season. Group operating income rose to NKr1.254bn from NKr1.154bn as operating profit dipped to NKr245m from NKr260m last year. However, during the second four-month interim period of the current financial year, pre-tax profit rose to NKr249m from NKr233m on respective operating income of NKr852m and NKr792m.</p>

			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / Technology: Dial a court report Evidence is growing in England and Wales that some lawyers' clients are paying for unintended repeat litigation of the same point in law because of fundamental weaknesses in the traditional shambolic 'system' of law reporting. In some cases highlighted by Kenneth Bagnall QC, chairman of New Law Publishing, contradictory conclusions are even being reached by courts unaware of each others' decisions. For centuries it has been up to private publishers like New Law Publishing to decide which cases to report and when to publish their reports. This means that although a court decision may set a binding precedent, the date and the content of a judgment can be delayed for years, or go completely unrecorded. 'We have a legal system with two legs, one of which is broken off at the knee,' says Bagnall, who last year was asked by Lord Justice Neill, chairman of the Information Technology for the Courts committee, to look at ways of speeding up law reporting. Now he believes he has found a solution using Mercury's Surefax automated facsimile service. New Law scans written judgments into its computer system, and types in relevant verbal judgments. The text is then edited and brief digests based on a 'menu' of case types are drawn up. These are faxed to the Surefax switch - a kind of automated fax exchange - using a code. Initially New Law focused on real property and town planning cases, but has expanded its service to commercial law, insolvency, shipping and intellectual property cases among others. The Surefax software maintains the list of subscribers' details and faxes the relevant digests to them overnight. If a line is busy it is retried until the fax goes through. Next morning subscribers select those they are most interested in and can then receive a fuller version of the judgment by fax. Subscribers, who are expected to include the big City law firms, are billed according to usage. Most subscribers prefer fax delivery, but an electronic mail alternative is expected to be available in the future. New Law Publishing: tel 0344-843696, fax 0344-842934.</p>

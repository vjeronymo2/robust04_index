			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Journal Commentator: "Hope for the Coming New </F> Year"]    [Text] The new year is here, to our broad readership we  send our warmest greetings!    In the coming new year, Chinese people follow our cultural  traditions to discard the old and welcome the new, and sincerely  look forward to the party and government to carry on the party's  fine traditions, wash away the harmful filth which has stained  the institutions of the party and government, and achieve better  results in the various tasks of building socialist modernization.    We highly endorse the suggestion of a high-ranking Chinese  leader that in implementing a socialist market economy, we  should study well what socialism means and wear the "socialist"  hat properly. That is to say that if we are truly working toward  socialism, we should not view socialism simply as a matter of  wearing, or not wearing a hat by that name. In fact, there are  some cadres who fail to clearly differentiate socialist market  economy from capitalist market economy to the extent that in  words or deeds they often toss aside the socialist "hat." There  are also those who, having other objectives in mind, openly  advocate steps which will greatly weaken and even dismantle the  collective economic system and, using open or covert tactics,  attempt to carry out privatization. Such theories and actions  are harmful to building socialist modernization; these, along  with the unhealthy tendencies manifested in the party and the  increasingly serious corruptions seen in the society during the  last few years, all show a trend that, if allowed to develop  unchecked, will lead to considerable dangers and therefore  cannot be treated lightly.    To China and its people, 1994 should be a glorious year as  well as a year of serious challenges. It is a glorious year  because the anti-corruption struggle launched under the party  and central government's leadership will gradually penetrate to  the grass-root levels; because the "Decisions on Certain Issues  Pertaining to the Establishment of a Socialist Market Economic  System" promulgated by the 3rd plenum of the 14th CPC Congress  will extend reform to the lower levels; and particularly because  the publication and subsequent organized studies of the third  volume of "Deng Xiaoping's Selected Works" will raise the  ideological consciousness among the broad masses of cadres and  people who, armed with such a weapon, will counter and overcome  the various unhealthy tendencies and launch a forceful struggle  against the reactionary forces which utilize peaceful overture  tactics against China in the international arena. If all party  and government cadres, particularly the leader cadres,  thoroughly study and completely understand the ideological  viewpoints of comrade Deng Xiaoping, they will in their work be  able to emphasize the good points, correct any shortcomings, and  carry out the party's basic line in a concrete, correct and  comprehensive manner, and the result will certainly be greatly  elevating the party's prestige among the masses and  strengthening the close relationship between the party and the  people.    Why do we say that the coming new year is also a year of the  most serious challenges? Because in terms of economics,  politics, ideology and other areas, numerous serious problems  still require solutions, and some of these urgently, such as  sharp drop in production, trade abnormalities, monetization out  of control and increasing inflation; we must pay close attention  to such problems and guard against their impact on the entire  process of economic construction, reform and opening up. In  restructuring the economic system and accelerating economic  development by intensifying reform, we should aim to speed up  the pace of making adjustments while maintaining stability, for  we cannot afford to allow chaos to develop by accelerating  development. In restructuring state-owned enterprises and  establishing a modernized enterprise system, we should protect  the primacy of the collectivized system, particularly the  central core of state-owned enterprises from being weakened or  dismantled. In summary, stable economic development is the  foundation for political stability and unity, and must therefore  be managed effectively.    With respect to the anti-corruption struggle currently  underway, this is a difficult major task which runs into much  resistance, particularly because in many large and major cases,  the people and projects involved are very complex, which make it  very difficult not only in indictment and investigation but also  in sentencing and punishment. In many localities, departments  and work units, there are cases of malfeasance, corruption,  abuse of authorities, embezzlement, giving and receiving bribes  on the part of some cadres and working personnel; the fact is  that such corrupt behaviors and activities which violate the law  and regulations have become habits after many years, and some  guilty persons not only are not ashamed, but are proud of their  activities of making more and more money, using clever tactics  and spending lavishly. In the anti-corruption struggle, such  people not only feel no remorse and admit no guilt but on the  contrary try to resist punishment by seeking assistance from  their superiors and subordinates, friends and colleagues. At the  same time, many trades and businesses act irregularly or  illegally in apportioning costs, levying penalties, collecting  fees, raising prices and using all kinds of ways to defraud and  take advantage of the people; although some regulations have  been issued to deal with these problems, because of the size of  China and its population, these abuses cannot be controlled or  stopped outright. Therefore, in the anti-corruption struggle, we  must be resolute in our determination, and must concentrate all  possible strengths, extend a helping hand to the masses, and  adopt severe and thorough measures to overcome the many  difficulties, before we can achieve greater results.    We will need to be more forceful in establishing the  ideology  of communism and in firmly supporting the party's ideological  political work which is at the heart of the socialist system. In  recent years, the ideological trend of bourgeois liberalization  has not disappeared but rather has intensified in certain  respects, and it retains the danger of once again polluting the  country; but yet, there are some stubborn supporters of  liberalization who, under the slogan of intensifying reform,  spread the harmful viewpoints of privatization and total  westernization among the masses, and serve the cause of the  Western reactionary forces which attempt to bring about changes  in China's system of socialism under the pretext of peaceful  evolution.    The above has demonstrated that many serious and urgent  problems still confront us, and that we must accept these  serious challenges and, through testing by them, continue to  make forward progress.    To solve the above-mentioned series of important problems is  not only the hope of the Chinese people but also the desire of  the rank and file cadres. If leader cadres of our party and  government, particularly the high-ranking leaders, themselves  share the hope and desire of the broad masses of people and  cadres, they need only to solve the problems people are  dissatisfied with and do well the things which benefit the  people, they will have accomplished their missions.    An ancient proverb states that one anticipates danger while  living in peace. For a nation, even when the economy is  developing, the political situation stable and the people well  off, [the government] should from time to time consider whether  any disasters, emergencies or dangers which escaped detection  may be threatening. The proverb is a warning to those in  political power not to be proud of or self-satisfied with what  they may have achieved, [a point which] many elderly  revolutionary leaders of our party have also earnestly  admonished us in the past. Today's situation and the tasks at  hand are very much more complicated than ancient times, the  changes are much more rapid, and we must constantly maintain a  very alert frame of mind, not overestimating what we have  accomplished or overlooking problems which still remain, but  making due assessment of the difficulties we face, if we are to  gain the benefits and avoid the pitfalls.    Communist Party cadres must anticipate danger while living  in  peace, not only because many yet to be resolved problems still  confront us as we go forward, but also because in the world at  large, class struggle has by no means disappeared, only the  methods of struggle have changed. In our relationship with the  monopolistic capital classes in the West, we now emphasize unity  as well as struggle. In economics, cooperation and unity are the  key: More exchanges, more businesses, the more we learn from  them the good things we ourselves can use, the better; but in  terms of ideology and politics, struggle unfortunately cannot be  avoided, and our struggle is directly mainly against the  reactionary forces that try to eliminate communism in China, for  the eyes of the reactionary forces are sharply focused on  Chinese Socialism, and they will not be satisfied unless and  until the Communist movement is completely destroyed within this  century; these reactionary forces will intensify pursuit of  their peaceful evolutionary strategy, and the Chinese people  must constantly and strictly guard against and resolutely resist  their open tactics and covert schemes and the various types of  attack. Naturally, because of the costs and benefits involved,  different developed capitalistic countries in the West have  different attitudes toward China, and we cannot treat them all  as one group.    When we talk about anticipating danger while living in  peace,  we are following the principle of seeking truth from facts; we  should neither exaggerate the difficulties involved nor make up  dangers where none exists and consequently lose our faith. At  the same time, after considering all possible dangers, we should  redouble efforts in our struggle to correct all mistakes and  shortcomings, do well in all the things that need to be done by  overcoming various difficulties, and make the party even  stronger in terms of ideology, politics and organization;  proceeding from an effective system of law, we should strengthen  management, increase efficiency and heighten the prestige of  democratic dictatorship of the people. At the same time, by  vigorously strengthening the conditions for ideological  political work, we should mobilize the enthusiasm for building  socialism among the broad masses of people, popularize again the  traditions of struggling against all hardships and preserving  against all odds, and help the people sweep away the unhealthy  ideology of money worship, extreme individualism,  self-indulgence, making of large gains from little labor and all  kinds and manners of corrupt behaviors and practices that are  being promoted in today's society. From this it can be seen that  our demand is not only to anticipate dangers, but to get rid of  these dangers and restore stability and peace.    In the new year, with joint efforts by the entire party and  all the Chinese people, given the prerequisite political  stability, we should strive to maintain forward progress and  momentum in the tasks of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics.</p>

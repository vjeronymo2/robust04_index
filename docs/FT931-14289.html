			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets: Italy and Spain attract strong interest Measures to boost popular share ownership in Italy and renewed foreign investment interest in Spain saw these two markets outperform the rest of Europe last week. But weakness in Denmark, upset by the resignation of Prime Minister Poul Schluter over the 'Tamilgate' affair, and Ireland, still fighting pressure to devalue the punt, helped to take the European component of the FT-A World Indices into negative territory. Spain has enjoyed a traditionally good start to the year, with hopes of an easing in interest rates throughout the Continent helping to improve confidence. Mr Victor Galliano, Spanish analyst at Baring Securities, comments that many investors are beginning to look to invest outside the hard currency markets and see Spain as a good opportunity. Inflation data which came in slightly under expectations year-on-year also gave a boost to the market, and Mr Galliano believes that the general index could reach a short term high of 250. The Italian market began to improve early in the week, ahead of Friday's decision by the government to allow investors a 27 per cent tax break in newly quoted companies and the opportunity to swap holdings in government bonds for privatised shares. Elsewhere, Hong Kong had a good week with a 5.5 per cent gain. Mr David Bates, of Asia Equity in London, ascribes this to suggestions that secret negotiations are being held between Chinese and UK officials to resolve the conflict over plans for political reforms in the colony. Reports that Governor Chris Patten has softened some of these proposals has also helped sentiment, he says. Among the Latin American markets, Mexico weakened 3.6 per cent in local currency terms, partly in reaction to Wednesday's allied air attack on Iraq which caused slight falls among many of the world's markets.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                           MARKETS IN PERSPECTIVE  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                   % change  % change in             % change in local currency**         sterling**  USDollar**              1 Week   4 Weeks   1 Year  Start of  Start of    Start of                                           1993      1993        1993  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Austria      -2.58    +0.75    -20.32    -5.60     -7.40       -6.42 Belgium      -0.43    +1.98     -3.69    +1.17     -0.94       +0.11 Denmark      -2.67    -1.84    -28.91    +0.64     -0.74       +0.31 Finland      -1.50    +7.08     +2.82    +7.50     +3.32       +4.41 France       -0.93    +3.98     -1.98    -0.70     -1.73       -0.70 Germany      +0.86    +3.56     -9.86    +0.21     -1.81       -0.77 Ireland      -3.09    +2.93    -13.61    +3.53     +2.10       +3.17 Italy        +6.51   +16.29     -6.73    +9.22     +6.07       -7.18 Netherlands  -0.22    +1.82     +1.08    +0.86     -1.13       -0.08 Norway       -1.34    +1.71    -15.36    +3.45     +2.81       +3.90 Spain        +4.66    +6.41    -10.01    +7.53     +5.26       +6.37 Sweden       -2.81    +1.77    +10.83    +0.07     -3.69       -2.68 Switzerland  +1.47    +3.37    +15.04    +0.79     -2.40       -1.37 UK           -1.28    -0.36    +10.21    -2.33     -2.33       -1.31 EUROPE       -0.18    +2.24     +1.82    -0.24     -1.44       -0.40 Australia    +1.00    +0.10    -11.39    -2.07     -5.02       -4.02 Hong Kong    +5.55   +12.11    +29.73    +6.04     +4.97       +6.08 Japan        -1.64    -5.85    -20.77    -3.11     -5.08       -4.08 Malaysia     -1.23    -2.83    +13.84    -2.87     -3.03       -2.01 New Zealand  -0.99    +0.35     -6.27    -3.16     -4.21       -3.22 Singapore    -1.22    +2.26     -4.06    -0.33     -2.41       -1.38 Canada       +0.15    -1.18    -10.94    -1.39     -3.22       -2.21 USA          +1.88    -0.77     +4.09    +0.33     -0.72       +0.33 Mexico       -3.63    +2.11    +11.55    -0.17     -0.87       +0.18 South Africa +0.86    +6.19    -11.84    +4.96     +4.50       +5.60 WORLD INDEX  +0.41    -1.11     -4.27    -0.66     -2.00       -0.97  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- ** Based on January 15th 1992.

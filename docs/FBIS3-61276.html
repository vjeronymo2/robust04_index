			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Oleg Poptsov, chairman of the VGTRK </F> [All-Russian State Television and Radio Broadcasting Company]    [Text] [Moroz] Oleg Maksimovich, the first question--from  the sphere of history: How did you manage to slip away from  Khasbulatov--not to allow him to bend Russian Television to his  will, which he wanted to do so passionately?    [Poptsov] In principle, the Supreme Soviet, in a purely  legislative sense, did not have any kind of rights to the  Russian Television and Radio company. The fact is that no one  founded it--it was organized by a decision of the presidium of  the Supreme Soviet. But this is not the same thing.  Nevertheless, we began to sense deputy pressure as early as the  Second Congress, just as it went on the air. A desire emerged  among the deputies to be present on the air, then it grew into a  desire to prevail on it, and in the end, into a desire to own  it. The situation began to heat up. Here, of course, it was  necessary to display a certain diplomatic ability, and at times  elementary cunning. On the one hand, to offer parliament an  opportunity to be present on the air in one way or another  (pluralism for us is natural), and on the other hand--to remain  true to the principle of protection of reform. We developed a  certain formula of political behavior: We are supporters of the  president, but we are opposed to his mistakes; we are supporters  of the progressive forces in parliament, but opposed to the  reactionary, conservative forces in it. When the situation got  completely hot, we had recourse to the protection of the law. By  taking advantage of precisely the fact that our company was not  founded, we held a conference of the labor collective and  elections of the leadership. What happened further is known. The  appearance of the "Parliamentary Hour" already signified the  stage of hand-to-hand fighting. I was absolutely convinced that  this "hour" would bring only harm. Khasbulatov spoke more than  once about this. Parliament was transformed into a kind of  theater, and it lived according to the laws of the theater. But  inasmuch as the actors were not professionals, the performance  only repelled the viewer. I would not want our present  government to make a similar mistake by trying to create its own  television studio. Journalistic professionalism should not be  confused with administrative professionalism.    When a head-on attack was started on the part of parliament,  I was faced with the task as the manager of the television and  radio company to involve the president in the resolution of this  problem. The president understood that the fate of reform and  his own political fate, curiously enough, was in the hands of  the mass media. Yeltsin reacted to the emerging situation  instantly, and he issued several documents concerning the  company. They were rescinded and suspended by parliament....  Then these absurd changes appeared in the Law on the Mass  Media--concerning the oversight councils....    [Moroz] Was strong pressure exerted on you personally?    [Poptsov] Of course. At that congress where the question  concerning oversight councils was discussed, there was also an  item on the agenda about my dismissal from the position I held.  It is hardly likely that I would have been dismissed at the  congress, but this was a strong move on the part of the deputies  and initiators of that inconceivable decree of the congress on  the mass media. I was practically the only one who could  professionally and conclusively oppose them. They sensed this  and took me out of the game. No matter what I said against the  amendments to the law, this could be easily represented as my  self-defense. It must be said that it was a brilliant move.    Afterwards, a skirmish started with the faction "Smena--New  Policy," Astafyev's group.... But when, at the very end of its  existence, the Supreme Soviet sent a commission to the company,  well, here, as the saying goes, the wounded were carried  directly from the battlefield....    [Moroz] Do you expect the same kinds of encroachments on RTV  [Russian TV] on the part of the newly elected Federal Assembly?  How do you expect to build relations with it? The experience of  the struggle with the Supreme Soviet will probably prove to be  apropos?    [Poptsov] The Federal Assembly is a legislative authority of  a transition period. Part of the conclusions, attitudes, and  world outlook in it will be from the past, and part--from the  future. The Duma faces a very complex test: Behind it is the  image of the past Supreme Soviet. If suddenly the relay of its  meetings is repeated and the television viewer sees not only  familiar faces, but also hears familiar speeches, when the  deputies vie in insulting the president, the viewer inevitably  will utter in response the fateful "Enough!" This will be the  beginning of the end of the Duma. Therefore, I think that  principles have to be developed that rule out a repetition of  that past unreasonableness.    There must be an edict, a strict rule, that would define the  practice of elucidating the activities of the president, the  government, and the Federal Assembly. This elucidation must go  into the general information stream. Television, radio, and  newspapers should have an opportunity, based on their  professional understanding, to be at meetings of the government,  the state, and so on, and throw light on these meetings in those  instances when the journalists deem it necessary.    [Moroz] A big "backlash" is taking place on television today  in connection with the phantasmagoric results of the elections.  Do you feel responsible for these results?    [Poptsov] Both yes, and no. More--no. Because this is  ridiculous--to blame everything on television. TV, radio, and  the newspapers simply reflect events. This is first. And,  second, we must subordinate ourselves to normative acts that  regulate an election campaign.    We were supporters of equal air time that was being offered  to the candidates. But the electoral commission took the Western  principle as a basis. We, after all, cannot live without  imitation, forgetting that, in contrast to "them," our democracy  is in its first stages. Blocs not only monopolized the  airwaves--they also monopolized the form of exposition. They let  loose a torrent of words onto the heads of the television  viewers, over and above discussions, and over and above debates,  and without any kind of critical commentaries. But now we are  looking for culprits.... First of all, the former candidates  themselves and their helpers should say to themselves: "We do  not know how to do that which is called an election campaign. We  do not know how to participate in the development of appropriate  normative documents. We missed that moment when the president  was preparing these edicts. We missed it! Everybody wanted to  make himself secure! So that it would be convenient and cozy for  himself. At the same time, it was forgotten that an idea does  not develop in a comfortable situation, but in an uncomfortable  one. It is necessary to have opposition for the birth of an  idea. Of course, there is such a genre as advocacy. But this  already simply requires oratorical skill. And so it has been  disclosed: There are no brilliant advocates among the democratic  figures. But Zhirinovskiy did not burden himself with ideas--and  he succeeded in oratorical skill. He handles himself well in  front of a camera. His weakness is when there are no television  cameras. He is extremely vulnerable here. And more. We became  more and more convinced: It is impossible to talk with everyone  simultaneously. Zhirinovskiy appealed to different social groups  separately. Gaydar is an excellent popularizer. But--among the  intelligentsia. However, a leader must feel confident with any  audience. Every leader has his own line, one induces laughter,  another debate, and the third--concentration, he makes you  think. Both the language and the style should change depending  on the situation.    [Moroz] Does it not seem to you that you also displayed  inadequate persistence in order to organize a debate,  commentaries, and the participation of a critically inclined  anchorman on Russian Television and Radio?    [Poptsov] Persistence is expedient until the adoption of a  law. But when it is adopted, we are obliged to observe it.  Everything happened rapidly. The periods allotted for the  election campaign were limited, and everything created in haste  suffers from mistakes. The normatives associated with  information support are the best evidence of this. The law  served the interests of the party. This was the first multiparty  election, and a new degree of democratic development, and all  the rest seemingly became secondary, including the interest of  the voter as well. Incidentally, Russian radio proved to be more  varied. Journalists took an active part in the programs--they  asked sharp questions, although they also did this  circumspectly, in view of the restrictive law. There were  excellent debate programs. If we return to television programs,  we were also preparing here for dispute and debate, and we  readied the studio in five variants. A television debate  variant, a press conference variant, and a cross-examination  dialogue variant, "one on one." But the parties chose the  monologue and the team self-representation variant. No one  wanted debates and disputes.    [Moroz] Did it not occur to you to show something just  before  the elections similar to Zhirinovskiy's film that was shown on  the Ostankino channel?    [Poptsov] We did have such work, but we abandoned it. It is  impossible to do anything the day before in Russia. The  unpredictability of the Russian character, among other things,  is that frequently everything is done "for spite." According to  sociological estimates, the film added 4 percent of the votes to  Zhirinovskiy at a minimum.    [Moroz] Sociologists say that the rapid increase in  Zhirinovskiy's support started a week before the elections. This  seems to indicate unequivocally: Television determined the  outcome of the voting....    [Poptsov] This is a correct observation. It is precisely at  that time that a definite drop occurred in the election  activities of the democrats. It became clear that the government  would not undergo radical changes. This diminished personal  interest in the election campaign. You must not weaken in a  distance race! Zhirinovskiy appeared for the last time on paid  radio and television air time on 30 November; that is, more than  10 days before the voting. But for free air time, his party,  like the others, drew lots. Russia's Choice was abundantly  represented on our channel, but this did not add votes to it,  because it conducted its agitation campaign both unskillfully  and in an untalented way. In addition, it absolutely did not  welcome criticism of its low-quality programs. Only at the very  end did it wake up and understand that it was necessary to bring  good polemicists to the fore. Chubays, of course, is the  strongest polemicist among them. He is both a polemicist and an  outstanding public speaker. But an understanding of this came  too late. And, in addition to everything else, the democrats  could not agree among themselves not only on the scale of the  whole democratic movement, they were unable to come to an  agreement even inside Russia's Choice. I do not know who on the  Russia's Choice team was answerable for the election image, but  the fact that there was no stage management there, nor  psychological training, nor an elementary understanding of who  your primary opponent is--this is unequivocal. But when the  candidates of one bloc could not unite in single-seat okrugs,  which led to defeat, this is already a signal concerning the  obvious instability of the bloc in the future. They all spied on  each other--God forbid that your colleague should become more  popular. Russia's Choice was unable to carry through even a line  of defense of the Constitution. "It broke down." We also do not  like everything in it. But when preparations began for the  referendum, we said on Russian Television: "That is all. The  time to argue whether the Constitution is good or bad has  passed. It is necessary now to explain to the people what is  important in it, and to apply all our energies only to this."  But the People's Choice candidates were engaged in a competition  to the finish line, as if secretly, but they are kicking the  Constitution, nonetheless.    [Moroz] In June of 1996, a fascist could become president of  Russia. This is no longer a fantasy, and it is not the delirium  of a madman; it is an entirely tangible possibility. What does  Russian Television plan to do in order to prevent this?    [Poptsov] It is necessary to talk about what is happening in  the country. What reform is giving, and how much it costs. Show  the emptiness of Zhirinovskiy's promises. Well, he says: "I will  make the Army strong." No one objects to this in principle, but  what is behind this specifically? In what way does he propose to  accomplish this? "I will bring Finland back into the Russian  structure." But this already means blood. It should be explained  what such imperial habits lead to.... It is necessary to say it  this way: To unite with force--means to kill.    [Moroz] Do you think that it is necessary to explain to  television viewers that gibberish is gibberish? To react to each  idiotic comment with a popular science program? "Children, we  must not employ an atomic bomb against Japan.... This is not  good.... This is inhuman...." Does it not seem to you that  within half a year of such talk that the country will turn into  a madhouse?    [Poptsov] Well, you are presenting this in a rather overdone  way. But in reality there is a rather serious problem here.  Question: For whom is the mass media intended? LITERATURNAYA  GAZETA, it is clear, is intended for the intelligentsia. But,  after all, now all newspapers of a democratic persuasion have a  claim on the same audience--the intelligentsia. And all  television is working on it. The mass media somewhat  imperceptibly lost the habit of talking in the language of the  other classes. Therefore, one of the main problems is to find a  field, but even better, several fields of a language that is  understandable and accessible.... Not a primitive one, but a  simple one that would reach people and touch them. Yet this is  impossible without an understanding of the interests of one or  another class, or one or another social stratum.    [Moroz] Do you intend to put this into practice?    [Poptsov] Of course. But here it is necessary to break the  psychology of those who work in broadcasting. All anchormen now  select as interlocutors only intelligent people who are  communicative and educated. And this is understandable, but this  is not the makeup of the whole society. A person should see  himself on the screen. He is just like me, and his worries are  just like mine. I believe him.    [Moroz] What can you say with respect to the removal of  Bragin from the post of chairman of the Ostankino television and  radio company? I understand that it is not very comfortable for  you to speak, but, still.... Does it not seem to you that he was  made a scapegoat in connection with the failure of the elections?    [Poptsov] I do not think that the elections played the main  role here.    [Moroz] After all, there were reasons to remove him earlier.  But it was timed specifically with the elections and to that  idiotic nighttime get-together in the Kremlin....    [Poptsov] It is both difficult for me to talk about this and  it is easy. For the reason that I was against that kind of  variant of a concluding night. I was an opponent of the film  about Zhirinovskiy that was shown on the 11th. I do not want to  say that I was consulted.... It is something else. In our  country, unprofessionalism is not considered a defect. Democrats  of the first wave fully copied and continue to copy the habits  of past authorities. The main thing is "friend or foe," but  professionalism is not even in third place, but in fifth place.  As for what happened, Vyacheslav Ivanovich is partly to blame  himself: Being a product of the rayon committee school, he  apparently became accustomed to being guided by the principle  "It is necessary!" He is appointed, then it is necessary. This  is first. Second: He was appointed, as you will recall, under  conditions of persecution on the part of Khasbulatov, and this  formed in Bragin the impression that he was a fighter for  democratic ideas and that therefore he was important. He  identified his polemical fervor with the professional skill of a  journalist. There was an interesting incident in my practical  work. Somehow I was called up by Tyazhelnikov, at that time the  first secretary of the TsK VLKSM [Central Committee of the  All-Union Leninist Communist Youth League], and was asked what  the pay was for the work of journalists who work on the journal.  I said: 250-300 rubles [R] per printer's sheet. Tyazhelnikov  became indignant and noted that central committee workers write  50 pages of information and do this free of charge. Just about  everybody was managing the journalists.    In general, the fact that the decision on the appointment of  Bragin was made under extreme conditions proved to be  determinative. This is always a risky matter.    This is the tragedy of democracy--a shortage of leaders, and  a terrible hunger for them. I have in mind not only political  leaders, but also professional leaders in various spheres.  Democracy is doomed if it does not have a powerful professional  layer in various spheres.    [Moroz] You came to television from our environment--from  the  environment of writing journalists. Moreover, you are a writer  and were for a long time the editor of a journal. What features  in the general atmosphere of television and the psychology of  the people grabbed your attention? I am personally struck by a  kind of heightened complexity of many television studio  employees. How can this be explained?    [Poptsov] A person who has been on the air if only five  minutes becomes half actor. And he already lives according to  the laws of the theater. He requires praise and applause. And he  gets very upset if there is none. It is like opium. A special  kind of arrogance emerges: They know me, they will recognize me.  But "recognize" still does not mean that they want to see you  and hear you. It is on television as nowhere else that arrogance  replaces knowledge and enlightenment. Further, television  demands colossal expenditures of nervous energy, incommensurable  with expenditures of energy on a newspaper or a journal. You  perform twofold work on television: First, you prepare the  program, and then you present it on the air. Therefore, nervous  breakdowns here are much more frequent and apparent. And,  finally, one more thing--television is cliquish. It does not  accept people from the outside. This does not exist, for  example, in the theater. A theater that does not replenish  itself with new people is doomed. But if you take  television--not only Russian Television--practically not one new  name has appeared here in the last five years. Perhaps Leonid  Yakubovich, the anchorman for "Fields of Miracles." A unique  kind of television pomposity exists. Its most widespread  manifestation: He does not understand anything about television.  Although it is clear that television lives according to the very  same laws as do the periodical press and theater, and that they  are not partitioned off by a Chinese wall. But here, there is an  effort to cut oneself off. Including from criticism....  Incidentally, television critics also do not make me happy. A  haughty opinion--this is on the one hand, and on the other  hand--slyness: How could they allow such an election campaign?  Although they know very well that it was impossible not to allow  it. However strange it may be, many critics are short on  spectator attributes.    Never rush to say that you saw more than the rest, do not  rush with your conclusions to assert your dislike for the author  of one or another program. There are a lot of personal scores in  articles of this kind of reporting, revenge for past slights,  which there probably were.    ....All of this makes work in television very difficult. But  the main difficulty is the lack of brilliantly talented people.  Although there are not enough of them anywhere.    [Moroz] What are you most dissatisfied with on Russian  Television?    [Poptsov] I am dissatisfied with the channel's slipshod  work.  I am dissatisfied with the fact that an enormous number of ideas  die without ever being realized. An intensely negative attitude  toward an idea exists if it was not you who expressed it. In  such a case, all efforts are expended not on realizing it, but  in a fight against it. No less dangerous is the untalented  implementation of an idea that simply ruins it. There are a lot  of excellent professionals here, obsessed people, but those  tendencies that have appeared on television in recent years are  too dangerous. I am disturbed, for example, by the neglect of  such a concept as the profession of producer, and as the role of  the artist. In its time, going live on the air caused a  revolution in television; it disrupted the usual, it disrupted  the exclusiveness, and the special theatricality. But we could  not stop in time. Live broadcasting went on the attack and began  to destroy television as an art. A whole category of television  studio employees began to appear who think: "I am on the  screen--and this is sufficient." The syndrome of "talking heads"  appeared, from which everyone is going mad. Talk alone is not  enough for television. It is also absolutely necessary to have a  play factor, and there must be inventiveness and staging. I  dream about a theater of social and political journalism, a  story theater, a fable theater.... If you wish, a theater of  economics. This is the only way to infect and capture the  viewer. Other television thinking has to be developed.    [Moroz] What can you say regarding the scandal surrounding  Channel 4 and the prospects for closing our "Russian University  Days?"    [Poptsov] This simply cannot be, because it can never be. I  have in mind the closing of "University Days." That is all we  need! We will raise the whole country, if there will be need of  this. As it is, reform has already crushed science, and it has  crushed enlightenment, education, culture.... I have talked  about this a thousand times. I spoke to everyone about this. To  the president, to the prime minister, and to the deputies. I  would put the question to the local powers that be in this way:  "Yes, today we cannot provide you with resources. It is  difficult. But we are giving you this channel. This is your  channel, scientists. This is your channel, teachers. This is  your channel, young people--an enlightenment and education  channel." Even if it kills us, we will defend this channel. We  defended it. We will not give up an inch. Any self-respecting  state should have such a channel. This is a channel which,  speaking in the fashionable idiom, should become the presentment  of the Russian intellect. It is necessary to bring the channel  up to snuff, to the necessary mark. We have already invested  enough energy in it. As everywhere, money and time are needed.  As for the remaining part of Channel 4, there, perhaps, there  you can do what you want. Two concepts have collided here: Our  "Russian University Days", or still another little Ostankino? It  is all the same, but in its own small variant. A little less  polished, a little more nonchalant, but, still, the  same--politics, music, theater.... I see no need to repeat one  and the same thing in 20 variants. Now, according to the edict  of the president, NTV [Independent Television) will work  together with us. They promise to amaze the world. We wish them  success. And we will wait.    [Moroz] At one time, you tried to arrange regular interviews  with the president and his periodical speeches on television.  Where did this idea get sunk--in Yeltsin's circle, or did he  bury it himself?    [Poptsov] It was possible to implement one-third of this  idea  in principle, but there is great resistance on the part of the  president's circle. Indeed, Boris Nikolayevich himself is a very  specific person. He himself is a reserved person by nature.  Difficult to get used to. With a confused idea about his own  positive and negative qualities. Someone suggested to him that  he loses in extemporaneous talks. In reality, improvisation is  his strongest side. Because he is a man of the people. He feels  good and at ease in a crowd. In a free dialogue, he proves  himself to be interesting, very original, and an interlocutor  who is not devoid of craftiness and cunning. He is quick to  react, and he has a good memory. In all of our practical work in  television interviews with him, Yeltsin did not once ask me  questions beforehand. We were simply able to come to an  arrangement while walking: We will talk about such-and-such a  subject.    The president has a normal human reaction. He gets offended  like a normal person. You can hear from him: I promised myself  to hold a grudge against you for two weeks, but it is already a  month today, and it is past the time, let us talk...."    [Moroz] Do you associate with him frequently?    [Poptsov] I try not to abuse this, but when it is necessary  for me to discuss some questions, and if the president is not  bearing a grudge against me, he is always ready to be contacted,  and the conversation, as a rule, turns out to be very open and  interesting. I do not recall that the president has refused to  meet.    [Moroz] Well, then, will there still be regular monthly  speeches of the president on Russian Television?    [Poptsov] I am confident there will be. And the last time we  came to an agreement, and we scheduled a program. But then some  kinds of events occurred.... Poptsov appeared somewhere in  Skokov's company--the circle immediately began to say: "There,  you see! Something is not right here...." The president is a  human being. He is also vulnerable, like all people. He has been  betrayed more than once. Before our eyes he was betrayed three  times in a major way. Under such circumstances each of us should  be more cautious in relations with other people, even more  suspicious. I understand him well. There is one more  obstacle--jealousy on the part of the Ostankino company. They  are beginning to calculate on which channel the president speaks  most often. These calculations absolutely do not interest me. I  am also not interested in the fact of who in a shot is next to  the president. All of this is details; the main thing is that  there should be a continuous, open dialogue with the president  on Russian Television. And there will be.</p>

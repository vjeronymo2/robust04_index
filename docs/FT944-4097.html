			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / International Capital Markets: Saudi loan in syndication for early 1995 Underwriters of a Dollars 700m loan to a Saudi petrochemical project hope to take the loan to general syndication early next year, bankers said yesterday, Reuter reports from Dubai. They said the loan for the Saudi-US joint venture Saudi Petrochemical (Sadaf) would be governed by English rather than Saudi law. 'The deal is attractive to banks because Sadaf's credit is good and because of the English law,' one said. Bankers said Citibank and Chase Manhattan have joined the underwriters with Dollars 100m each. The other six underwriters had committed themselves to Dollars 500m. The bankers said the 8 1/2 -year loan will be priced at 125 basis points over Libor.</p>

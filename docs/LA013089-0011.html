			<p><P> January 30, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: ART  </P> <P> The first Salvador Dali work to be sold in Spain since his death last week  brought $131,000 -- about three times the catalogue price. The work was a 1948  gouache study of costumes for a production of Shakespeare's "As You Like It."  The buyer represented a private collector. A spokeswoman for Sotheby's auction  house said the surrealist painter's death had influenced interest in his work,  but added it was too early to say if prices would rise. "The market will be  more influenced by the contents of his will -- if, for example, the bulk has  been left to public institutions, then there would be a limited number of  paintings on the market." Dali died in his hometown of Figueras at the age of  84 after an attack of pneumonia. His will is due to be opened in about two  weeks. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

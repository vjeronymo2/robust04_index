			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Gustavo Krieger] </F>   [Text] The land occupation operations conducted by the  Landless People's Movement [MST] are headed by professional  militants trained by the organization.    Ailton Kroda, who coordinated the land occupation operation  at Lagoa Vermelha (RS) [Rio Grande do Sul State], is a veteran  in this sort of activity.    Kroda already has participated in six land occupation  operations. He admitted to this newspaper that he already has  received a lot of land but continues "to help the movement."    The MST leaders receive political training. The MST has  linked up with CUT [Sole Workers Center] and Catholic Church  groups to create a training center at Braga (RS).    Officially, this center is an agricultural technical school  -- the Foundation for Educational Development and Research  [Fundacao para o Desenvolvimento Educacional e Pesquisa --  Fundep].    The 80 students enrolled at Fundep per year are recommended  by the MST and CUT. Their ages range from 14 to 18.    In the morning they have normal classes. In the afternoon  they till the land. At night they receive political training.    The MST "indoctrination copy books" are supposedly didactic  material, but they contain biographies of revolutionary figures  such as Che Guevara and a "calendar of people's struggles."    Jose Adelmar Batista, one of three Fundep coordinators, says  the political training's objective "is to teach the students to  question unfairness and get organized to fight it."</p>

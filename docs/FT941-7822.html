			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / Business and the Environment: Climate cools to HFCs - The industry's preferred alternative to CFCs is under scrutiny One of the last official publicity events undertaken by Tim Yeo, former UK environment minister, was to be photographed with a CFC-free refrigerator, one of 10 bought by his department. He left office under a cloud, but the fridge is still there. Its presence shows the attention given to environmental issues in the energetic debate about the merits of the various CFC (chlorofluorocarbon) alternatives in refrigeration. Doubts have arisen over new, ozone-benign gases, called HFCs (hydrofluorocarbons), and over the returns the chemical industry can expect from its investments in the design and manufacture of these gases. The debate is being fanned by the imminent end of CFC production in the west, leaving the refrigeration industry dependent on existing stocks of the gases. CFCs are controlled by the United Nations under the Montreal Protocol, which stipulates phase-out at the end of 1995. Members of the European Union must cease production at the end of 1994, but existing stocks can be used after that date until they run out. Now, the environmental credibility of HFCs - long criticised by environmental groups for their global warming potential - has been questioned officially by the US and UK governments. Not only is the Yeo fridge CFC-free, but it avoids use of the chemical industry's alternative refrigerant, HFC 134a - made by Du Pont of the US using the Suva brand name and by Britain's ICI as Klea. Instead, it uses hydrocarbons, running on a butane/propane mix; its insulating foam was blown with another hydrocarbon, cyclopentane. Until recently, nearly all domestic fridges used CFC as the refrigerant and to blow the insulating foam. Yeo's German-made fridge, Greenfreeze, is promoted by Greenpeace. The environmental group has been largely responsible for re-introducing hydrocarbons as a viable alternative to CFCs and HFCs. Hydrocarbons and other natural gases such as ammonia were widely used as refrigerants before CFCs were invented. Ammonia is used in large-scale chillers, such as in ice-rinks, and in small fridges. Most big German manufacturers have launched a hydrocarbon fridge or plan to do so, although they are also starting to use HFC 134a. Bosch-Siemens of Germany, for instance, recently said it would stop using HFCs as soon as replacements could be found. By the start of 1995, more than 80 per cent of its production will use hydrocarbons only. The rest - mainly frost-free models - will use 134a as a refrigerant until an alternative is found. 'Until recently, 134a was to be the only alternative. Soon, it will not be an alternative at all,' predicts Corin Millais, a specialist in CFC alternatives at Greenpeace. But the threat to 134a and other HFC blends must be seen in the context of the whole market for CFC alternatives. The value to the chemical industry of the domestic fridge market is 'peanuts', according to Maurice Perrenoud, industry specialist at Du Pont Fluorochemicals in Geneva. According to Mike Harris, an ICI spokesman, the market comprises around 5 per cent of the total refrigeration sector, which includes industrial chilling and air conditioning. Du Pont and ICI see their main markets for HFCs emerging in the non-domestic markets. 'Most new cars will be using 134a in their air conditioning systems by the end of the year,' says Harris. Du Pont and ICI have spent heavily on developing HFCs and building plants to make the chemical. Du Pont says it has invested Dollars 500m (Pounds 300m) on CFC-alternatives, including solvents, propellants, foam blowers and refrigerants. ICI's investment is around Pounds 250m. HFCs cannot replace CFCs without big changes in refrigeration technology. Du Pont and ICI have had to develop new technologies, such as special lubricants, to enable fridge makers to use HFCs. Until recently, the chemical companies were worried about the slow sales of HFCs and the lack of enthusiasm shown by potential customers. They now say that sales are growing. 'It is looking that we built the right plants in the right place, but with hindsight maybe six months too early,' says Harris. Andrew Benson, chemicals analyst with Barclays de Zoete Wedd, stockbrokers to ICI, says hydrocarbons will not be a threat to the emerging HFC market and he expects substantial increases in sales of HFCs. Meanwhile, the refrigeration industry appears divided about the merits of HFCs. Also, many are worried that if they decide to use HFCs, they might become locked into a technology that could increase their costs and limit choices later on. This debate is obscured by technicalities surrounding the merits of various refrigerants, the growing unease in some sectors about the global warming potential of HFCs and the increasing emphasis on the energy efficiency of refrigerants. There are, however, three certainties. First, HFCs are not necessarily the easy option for the refrigeration industry, although they will be used in some circumstances. The biggest problem lies in making HFCs work with systems designed for CFCs. This is especially acute in the US where a large proportion of cars have air-conditioning systems. Although manufacturers are offering to replace the CFCs with HFCs and make the necessary technical changes, the process is neither cheap nor necessarily effective. This has led to the US government asking Du Pont to continue making CFCs for a year longer than the company intended. Du Pont planned to stop making CFCs by the end of this year, but the US Environmental Protection Agency says the car industry needs another year for a smooth phase-out and to maintain its warranty promises. Second, more HFC alternatives will become viable as research progresses  - Greenpeace can cite working technologies that use carbon dioxide and even water. Hydrocarbons and ammonia, while suitable in some circumstances and acceptable to some countries, suffer from safety problems. Ammonia is highly toxic and has to be used under strictly controlled conditions, while hydrocarbons are a fire hazard and potentially explosive. Third, the refrigeration industry has been very slow to face the problem of finding suitable alternatives before CFCs run out. It took Greenpeace to show the fridge makers that there were existing and viable alternatives to CFCs and HFCs. Without this impetus, it is unlikely that hydrocarbons - which are only one alternative - would now be offered by leading makers of domestic fridges. Meanwhile, further complications grow. US President Bill Clinton's Climate Change Action Plan, revealed last year, includes plans to control emissions of HFCs. The UK government announced similar plans as part of its commitment to the climate change treaty. This means HFCs could in the near future become controlled gases in the same way as CFCs.</p>

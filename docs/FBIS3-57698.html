During the conversation the people's deputies of Ukraine  asked President Kravchuk about his attitude toward the  presidential election in Crimea. In this connection Kravchuk  said: I respect the right of the electorate to elect the  president they want, but if the president of the Crimea Republic  violates the law and the Constitution of Ukraine then I, as the  president of Ukraine, will use my constitutional plenary powers  and take relevant measures to revoke the illegitimate decisions.

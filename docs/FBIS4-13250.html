			<p>BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali received  at his office at the Parliament today Nabih Birri, speaker of  the Lebanese Chamber of Deputies, and the delegation  accompanying him.    At the outset of the meeting, Dr. al-Majali asserted that  this country's approach has always been Arab and Islamic.  Jordan's eagerness to promote Arab causes is equal to its  eagerness to promote its own interests, al-Majali added. He  went on to say: We view Lebanon as a fraternal Arab state. We  support its causes and issues, especially given the calamities  and attacks to which southern Lebanon has been exposed. We hope  that Lebanon will recover and remain a strong country, a strong  foundation contributing to the Arab nation's strength.    Dr. al-Majali also addressed the issue of peace, and  Jordan's  position toward peace efforts, as explained by His Majesty King  Husayn. He reasserted that the solution must be just and  comprehensive on all fronts. He added that any solution must  ensure the restoration of all Arab rights. He went on to say  that Jordan has pursued contacts and coordination with all  concerned Arab parties, including the PLO, which is the  representative of the Palestinian people, to help form a unified  Arab stand that will help to achieve peace on the basis of  justice and equality, a peace that will be accepted by future  generations.    Dr. al-Majali underscored the need to close Arab ranks and  unify Arab positions, since this would promote the Arab nation's  standing and enable it to cope with its own problems and issues.  He added that Jordan views all Arab brothers as a part of this  nation. Besides, Jordan has been directly and effectively  involved in problems. The most recent evidence of this is  Jordan's accommodation of some 300,000 refugees in the aftermath  of the Gulf war. He indicated that this, given Jordan's  capabilities and resources, constitutes a heavy burden.  Nonetheless, Jordan believes that their presence here is the  outcome of difficult circumstances created by the Gulf war.    For his part, Nabih Birri underlined Jordan's honorable  positions under His Majesty King Husayn toward all Arab and  pan-Arab causes. He also underscored Jordan's support for  Lebanon in the years of its ordeal and Jordan's help in coping  with this ordeal. He added: Our prime concern in Lebanon is to  achieve security and stability, which we are beginning to see.  The Lebanese Government has drafted a plan to rebuild the  infrastructure damaged during the internal strife. Moreover,  there is a focus on rebuilding southern Lebanon, which has  continued to come under constant Israeli attacks.    The meeting was attended by Tahir al-Masri, speaker of the  House of Representatives; Dr. Khalid al-Zu'bi, minister of state  for legal and parliamentary affairs; the Jordanian ambassador in  Beirut; and the Lebanese ambassador in Amman.    Senate President Ahmad al-Lawzi met with the speaker of the  Lebanese Chamber of Deputies and his delegation at the  Parliament earlier in the day. House of Representatives Speaker  Tahir al-Masri attended.    At the outset of the meeting, al-Lawzi noted that Lebanon  has  always provided a haven for the nation's thinkers. He noted the  commonalities in the two countries, particularly in terms of  their history and their efforts to establish true inter-Arab  cooperation to promote inter-Arab integration in all spheres.  He reaffirmed the importance of the role the Lebanese Chamber  of Deputies can play to safeguard Lebanon and its unity to help  it return to the forefront. He also called for honoring  international legitimacy and implementing the UN resolutions  pertaining to southern Lebanon, asserting Jordan's strong faith  in true peace, peace that will restore rights to their rightful  owners. He added that there is no alternative to a just and  comprehensive peace that will end massacres and occupation. He  noted that it is Israel which is sponsoring terrorism, and that  it was Israel which occupied Arab lands and perpetrated  killings, displacement, and settlement activities throughout the  occupied Arab territories. He called for an end to these  practices so that peace can be achieved in the region.    For his part, Nabih Birri, speaker of the Lebanese Chamber  of  Deputies, expressed his thanks and appreciation to His Majesty  King Husayn, the Jordanian Government, and the Jordanian people.  He underlined the strong Jordanian-Lebanese relations in all  spheres.    Nabih Birri added: Jordan does not need to absolve itself of  any alleged terrorism, particularly since everybody is well  aware of His Majesty King Husayn's moderation, patience,  shrewdness, wisdom, and intelligence. Everybody is well aware  that Jordan has paid a high price for terrorism. He wondered:  Is the person who acts in defense of his territories, homeland,  and rights an extremist terrorist? By contrast, can the party  that occupied another's territory by force, and displaces its  population and owners be called a non-terrorist?    Birri continued: It is no coincidence that Israel is  perpetrating terrorism in southern Lebanon and accusing Jordan  of terror. He recalled the killing of innocent civilians at the  Ibrahimi Mosque, wondering: What can this be called? Was it a  premeditated act, planned a long time ago? What is the daily  shelling of Lebanese cities and the displacement of their  residents called?    Birri asserted that we are engaged in acts of self-defense,  whereas the Israelis have fostered terrorism. He indicated that  without a just and comprehensive peace in the region, the  phenomenon they call terrorism will spread. He wondered: How  can you blame me when you push me too far?    Birri urged the Arab nation to unify its ranks. He indicated  that the current Arab state of affairs is the result of its  weakness and disunity. He reiterated that the pressure put on  Jordan and the threats made against its stability and security  are designed to make it conclude a unilateral deal so that it  may be dissociated from Lebanon and Syria. The same goes for  Lebanon and the attempts to make it sign a unilateral deal with  the Zionist entity. He reaffirmed the seriousness of concluding  such unilateral deals, because this would undermine the  inalienable legitimate rights of the parties concerned.    At the end of the meeting, which was attended by members of  the Lebanese and Jordanian delegations, the two sides held a  lengthy discussion on the current Arab state of affairs, issues  of common interest between the two fraternal states, and mutual  coordination. They said that the pressure applied to Jordan does  not frighten us, particularly since similar pressure has been  applied in the past.    The Jordanian and Lebanese sides reaffirmed the importance  of  national unity, indicating that it is the most effective means  of resistance.    During the meeting, the two sides discussed the issue of  forming a Jordanian-Lebanese parliamentary committee that could  be expanded in the future to include other nations. The purpose  of this committee would be to examine the potential of current  developments.</p>

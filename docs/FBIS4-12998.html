			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>   [Excerpts] The NATO air attack on Serb positions last  Monday, with the objective of forcing them to respect Gorazde as  a UN declared safe haven, will undoubtedly affect the stand of  all the warring sides and the influential foreign states. It is  said that the U.S. Government wishes to continue such attacks  from time to time, for the Serb aggression against Gorazde has  wiped off the United Nations' last vestige of prestige and has  undermined the Security Council decisions, taken under the  influence of the western governments. But it seems that NATO is  the main loser of this international air display.    The NATO air raids, although limited to some sort of air  display so far, has angered the Russians who were not consulted  on the decision to launch an air strike. [passage omitted]    The extreme nationalists of the Russian legislatures,  including Zhirinovskiy's Liberal Democratic Party, have now  become the major faction influencing Russia's foreign policy.  This faction does not wish to see further humiliation of  Russia. They become angry when they see their Slav brothers are  killed by the NATO bombs. The Russian Foreign Minister Andrey  Kozyrev, therefore, protested and adopted a stand against the  NATO air attack on the Serb positions. The attack foiled his  dream of hoping that the West would consider Russia as an equal  and trustworthy partner. The question in everybody's mind in  Russia today is, when will the West stop humiliating Russia?</p>

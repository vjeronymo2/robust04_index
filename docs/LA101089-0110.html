			<p><P> October 10, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> IT'S A GOOD YEAR FOR FLEAS, BAD FOR HUMANS AND FIDO  </P> <P> The house sat vacant for weeks, but that did not bother the fleas.  </P> <P> Although the household pet had moved on, the fleas patiently bided their time,  reproducing themselves, hatching out of eggs and becoming increasingly ravenous  while waiting for a warm-blooded animal to wander by to provide a long-awaited  feast.  </P> <P> "You go in and all of a sudden you've got fleas all over your legs, covering  you," said Marge Duncan, a real estate associate with Century 21 Realty in  Mission Viejo. "It can be pretty awful."  </P> <P> For untold numbers of Orange County residents, the annual battle against the  blood-sucking varmints has been particularly difficult this year, as a warm,  damp September offered perfect conditions for fleas to go about the things they  do best: eating, reproducing, and annoying people and pets. Though exact  figures are hard to come by, several pest control companies report that their  flea business is up noticeably.  </P> <P> "It's been an extremely tough year for fleas," said Brian Olson, general  manager of The Bugman, a Fullerton pest control company. Tony Alcantar of Vint  Pest Control in Santa Ana agreed. "They've kept us hopping," he quipped.  </P> <P> According to Olson, The Bugman's flea business is up 40% over this time last  year, and he puts most of the blame on homeowners, whom he and other flea  experts say often do not know the basics of flea combat.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Importance of Dipping  </P> <P> "A lot of homeowners aren't aware that it's important to have their pets  dipped, in addition to treating their homes," said Paul Lew, production  coordinator for Mission Pest Control. Lew said his firm has not had a  noticeable increase in flea business this year but added that about half the  company's 300 to 400 calls a day come from customers who have felt the stinging  bite of a flea.  </P> <P> The pest professionals recommend that flea-afflicted pet owners and others  thoroughly vacuum their homes, throwing away the vacuum cleaner bag once the  place is clean. Bedding and anything else that the pet is associated with  should be washed and machine-dried and the animal flea-dipped by a  professional. Then the house needs a shroud of chemicals that stay in the  carpet -- a favorite flea hideaway -- and kills the little pests as they hatch.  </P> <P> "The homeowner's part is about 70% of controlling fleas," Alcantar said.  "Customers need to take the time to educate themselves."  </P> <P> But while home and pet owners can improve the situation, many factors are out  of their control. There is the weather, for example, which experts say could be  a chief reason for this year's flourishing flea population.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Humidity Factor  </P> <P> "We've has some pretty good humid weather in September, and that could be a  factor," said Rudy Geck, a vector ecologist with the Orange County Vector  Control District, the agency that rides herd on pests. "Those climatic  conditions contribute to the propagation of fleas."  </P> <P> While cautioning that no hard figures exist to compare this year with previous  ones, other flea experts agree that the weather has been good for the insects.  </P> <P> "When you have warm temperatures and the relative humidity is high, that's when  you get most fleas," said Michael Rust, a UC Riverside entomologist who  specializes in the study of fleas, cockroaches and other urban insects. Rust  currently is studying fleas, remarkably resolute creatures that can go for  months without eating and can jump enormous distances on their tiny legs.  </P> <P> Because fleas thrive and reproduce in warm, damp weather, winter usually brings  a natural decline in their population. And although some pest control employees  warn that indoor heating can provide the bugs with safe haven for the winter,  Rust believes that relief is just around the corner for most residents.  </P> <P> "Generally, with the heating on, the air becomes drier," he said. "While the  temperature is sufficient, the lower humidity is deleterious to them."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Role in Epidemics  </P> <P> Fleas, all 2,237 species of them, have pestered mankind for as long as anyone  can remember. The bugs, which latch on to all manner of warm-blooded "hosts,"  have been implicated in epidemics no less serious than the 14th-Century's Great  Plague, and occasional sporadic cases of bubonic plague surface even today. On  a milder note, some people and pets are allergic to flea bites, and suffer  swelling and irritation as a result.  </P> <P> But for the most part, experts agree that fleas are more of an annoyance than a  genuine health hazard. County vector control, which targets disease-carrying  pests for monitoring and eradication, all but ignores fleas, leaving them to  private enterprise to control.  </P> <P> "It really is just the nuisance factor," Geck said. "They're pretty  exasperating."  </P> <P> </P> <P> FACTS ABOUT FLEAS  </P> <P> Fleas are small, wingless insects that live on humans, dogs, cats, rats, birds,  horses, poultry, rabbits and many wild animals.  </P> <P> They suck blood for food, using their beaks to puncture skin. They usually feed  once a day. They can, however, survive for several weeks or even months without  food.  </P> <P> Fleas have flat sides and a head much smaller than the rest of their bodies.  Strong legs help them move quickly through the hairs (or feathers) of their  host. And they have great leaping prowess.  </P> <P> When a flea bites, it injects a salivary secretion into the wound. It is this,  experts suspect, that causes itching.  </P> <P> Human reactions to flea bites can vary greatly -- some people seem to never be  bitten while others may be allergic to them. To the latter, a single bite can  cause great swelling and inflammation.  </P> <P> Fleas carry such diseases as plague and murine typhus.  </P> <P> The best protection against fleas is cleanliness (fleas can live for a short  time in dust and debris) and proper care of pets. Pets that have fleas should  be treated with a commercial flea powder or spray that contains either rotenone  or pyrethrum, both of which should kill the fleas.  </P> <P> Sources: Collier's Encyclopedia and the World Book Encyclopedia  </P> <P> Compiled by Kathie Bozanich  </P></p>

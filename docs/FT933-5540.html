			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar undermined by data THE DOLLAR lost nearly two pfennigs against the D-Mark in European trading yesterday after a spate of poor data raised new questions about the state of the US economy, writes James Blitz. The US currency was weakened after the White House revised down its forecast for growth in the US economy in 1993 to 2.0 per cent from the 2.8 per cent estimate given in April. Compounding the gloom was a slight fall in the National Association of Purchasing Managers Index, which slipped from July's 49.5 to 49.3 in August. Personal income figures also showed a surprise 0.2 per cent dip, the first month-on-month decline since 1954. By contrast, the outlook for the German economy looked somewhat better, with industrial production rising 0.5 per cent in July against forecasts of a decline of 0.1 per cent. For those investors seeking a return on short-term investments, German interest rates have remained on hold this week, with the repo rate re-established at 6.80 per cent. The overall impact of all this data was to push the dollar down to a low of DM1.6560 in Europe, having opened at DM1.6680. Against the yen, the dollar was more robust, closing at Y105.70 from a previous Y104.70. New York trading ended with the dollar standing at DM1.6590 and Y105.35. Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief currency strategist at Citibank in London, said the dollar had probably seen its high for 1993 in last month's DM1.7480 level. He believes that DM1.6490 is the next key chart point for the dollar. 'If it breaks through that level, we should go down to DM1.59,' he added. On the dollar/yen rate, Mr MacKinnon is far more upbeat on the US side, suggesting that the Japanese currency has peaked. 'We should enter a trading range of Y110 to Y115 before the end of the year,' he said. However, the Japanese authorities announced yesterday that their foreign exchange reserves had risen by some Dollars 8.79bn in August, the highest monthly increase ever. The Japanese authorities will join the growing list of central banks who have to sell dollars to rebalance reserves, keeping a cap on the US currency. In Europe, the D-Mark was somewhat stronger against most European currencies as the Bundesbank appeared to be keeping interest rates on hold. The French franc weakened to a close of FFr3.507 against the D-Mark from a previous FFr3.495, but sterling finished at DM2.5025, up  3/4 pfennig on the day. The Belgian franc came under heavy pressure again after strong speculation that its link with the D-Mark was to be further undermined and that foreign exchange intervention would be suspended. The currency dropped as low as BFr21.55 against the D-Mark at one stage. But the Belgian central bank twice announced that it would maintain its strong franc policy and the Belgian franc closed at BFr21.49.</p>

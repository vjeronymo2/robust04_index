			<p><P> December 20, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> $500,000 ALLOCATED FOR PLANNING REVITALIZATION OF THE ALEX THEATRE  </P> <P> After more than a decade of discussion, the Glendale Redevelopment Agency on  Tuesday allocated $500,000 toward planning for preservation of the historic  Alex Theatre.  </P> <P> The funds -- the first to be spent specifically for the theater project in the  downtown redevelopment zone -- are described as "seed money" for revitalization  of the Alex Theatre. The project could cost as much as $15 million, according  to earlier estimates.  </P> <P> A portion of the $500,000 could be used to purchase the famed Lanterman Theater  organ from La Canada Flintridge and move it to the Alex Theatre, said Jeanne  Armstrong, Glendale redevelopment director.  </P> <P> The agency also unanimously authorized formation of an Alex Theatre  Revitalization Task Force, a 15-member committee of community representatives  to be appointed early next month by Mayor Larry Zarian. The committee will be  charged with developing goals for use of the theater and plans to achieve them.  </P> <P> Members of the City Council, who also serve as the agency, had backed off from  discussing the Alex Theatre several years ago because the city does not expect  to have the money for a major revitalization project before the late 1990s.  They said Tuesday, however, that the availability of the organ, as well as a  groundswell of community support for the theater, prompted the early action.  </P> <P> "All of the pieces are weaving together," Councilman Carl Raggio said. "Before,  it was just wishful thinking."  </P> <P> The La Canada Flintridge City Council agreed in September to sell the rare 1926  Wurlitzer pipe organ given to the city in 1987 from the estate of the late  Assemblyman Frank Lanterman. The Alex Theatre originally had an organ of its  own and Lanterman had played it on opening night in 1925.  </P> <P> A week after La Canada's decision, the Glendale Historical Society put on a  fund-raising, Broadway-style show at the Alex that drew widespread support from  the community.  </P> <P> Suddenly, the city's interest in the Alex Theatre was renewed, officials said.  </P> <P> La Canada officials last month tentatively accepted Glendale's offer to buy the  organ for $50,000. Details of the sale agreement are expected to be completed  within a few weeks, Glendale City Manager Dave Ramsay said.  </P> <P> The action this week will allow Glendale to fulfill its offer. But the cost of  relocating and renovating the instrument, one of only four of its kind  remaining in the world, is estimated at up to $500,000 and that money will have  to come from other sources, officials said.  </P> <P> Mayor Larry Zarian, who is seeking reelection to the council next spring, has  made revitalization of the Alex Theatre and acquisition of the organ top  priorities. He said strong financial support from the business community is  vital to the success of the project.  </P></p>

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report]  <H6>  SUNDAY TIMES </H6>   ANC Program--"Nelson Mandela's call this week for an end to  the rent boycotts that have crippled the administration of the  townships" marks "the transition of the ANC [African National  Congress] from liberation movement to government-in-waiting,"  the Johannesburg SUNDAY TIMES in English editorial on 23  January on page 20 notes. The editorial describes the ANC's  program of reconstructiona and development as a "desperate,  amateurish first attempts to come to grips with the needs of  40-million people, half of them illiterate and two-thirds  impoverished." Referring to the ANC program's "economic babble,"  the editorial notes that "all this well-meaning babble is  difficult to connect to the immense and very real problems  facing the ANC. Peace, or the restoration of law and order, will  be the work of a decade, and it will not be accomplished unless  the ANC learns to treat its opponents with greater tolerance  than the township self-defense units show." "As for jobs,  education, health, housing, the ANC will not only need the help  of existing `power structures,' but it will be hard put simply  to avoid disastrous error."  <H6>  SUNDAY NATION </H6>   ANC Candidates--An editorial in the Johannesburg SUNDAY  NATION in English on 23 January on page 8 notes that the ANC  list of 200 candidates for the National Assembly is "remarkable"  in that the ANC "lived up to its democratic tradition in the  process of nominating people as its membership from the  grassroots became directly involved." "Also noteworthy is the  fact that they were able to pull together a large section of the  South African society into its list." The editorial hopes that  "the same process, or even a more improved one, is going to be  followed for the local government elections." However "the list  represents more of a popularity poll and a strategy to win more  votes rather than a selection of people who will perform  particular tasks once they are in Parliament." "Of more concern  is the fact that certain people on the list are not known to be  loyal to ANC policy" and some "are even regarded as enemies by  people who live near them."  <H6>  BEELD </H6>   East Rand Cancer Must Not Spread--The Johannesburg BEELD in  Afrikaans of 20 January says in a page-10 editorial: "Whether  the black residential areas of the East Rand are officially  declared disaster areas is of purely academic interest. For all  practical purposes they have been disaster areas for a long time  already. They are also battlefields, where people are murdered  daily as a result of the bloody political struggle between the  African National Congress and the Inkatha Freedom Party. How  leaders of these two groups can allow their supporters to create  such a situation is inconceivable." "The infrastructure there  has been totally destroyed, vandalism and anarchy prevail, the  hostility and suspicion between groups is tangible, and the  image of the security forces as maintainers of law and order has  been totally shattered." "Now is not the time for political  parties to be blaming one another as to who is responsible. Now  is the time to rescue what can be rescued." BEELD concludes:  "If political opponents can be drawn into such a plan and the  community does its part, this ulcer on the East Rand can be  excised. It is a cancer which must not be allowed to spread."    Self-Interested People Sabotage Their Own Future--A second  editorial of the 20 January BEELD on page 10 points out: "The  disruption of medical services as has happened at Kalafong  Hospital outside Pretoria resembles in several aspects last  year's catastrophic disruption of black education. In both  cases the disruption was caused by people responsible for the  care of those who in civilized society would be protected--in  one case children, in the other, the sick." "In both cases the  motive was self- interest." "Both cases represent a disruption  of essential services to a community which can ill afford it, by  people from the same community. In this way people are  sabotaging their own future."    Mandela Must Count His Words--A third editorial says: "Mr.  Nelson Mandela certainly had no ulterior motive when he said  that it could be in the country's interests to have a non-ANC  president, even if the ANC wins the April election. He was  probably only being generous. But Mr. Mandela should realize  that because of his position as the leader of what seems to be  the strongest political grouping in the country, he has a  particular duty to consider his words carefully. He cannot  utter such a far-reaching statement and simply walk away without  indicating who he had in mind. What his followers think of such  a statement, only he could know. But one can guess that there  would be shock and confusion. The electorate have an absolute  right to know for whom and for what they are going to vote.  Indeed, their vote is not a mandate for politicians to appoint  people for whom they did not vote. Times are simply too serious  for this kind of loose talk. Politicans must make it their duty  to reduce, not increase, the confusion."</p>

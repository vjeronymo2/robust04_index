			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / Government retreats on teacher training plans THE GOVERNMENT has partly retreated from controversial proposals to shift secondary-level teacher training in England and Wales from training institutions to schools. Mr John Patten, education secretary, yesterday announced modifications to plans by his predecessor, Mr Kenneth Clarke (now home secretary), to impose a 20 per cent ceiling from September on the college-based component of courses for the postgraduate certificate of education. The ceiling will instead be a third, to be achieved by 1994. That will raise the school-based component of courses from a current average of 18 weeks to 24 weeks - out of the 36 weeks that the courses run. Higher education institutions, and the government's Council for the Accreditation of Teacher Education, expressed strong opposition to the original plans. They feared that the move would undermine college education departments and impose an excessive load on schools selected for training. Mr Patten said: 'It is important to give trainee teachers as much school-based training and experience as possible, without imposing unnecessary burdens on heads and senior teachers.' He added: 'In striking the balance at 24 weeks I believe that I am setting a tough but fair requirement . . . I expect practising teachers to be more fully involved in the design of courses and in the assessment of students than they are at present.' In a letter to Sir William Taylor, chairman of the accreditation council, Mr Patten said the government would not be issuing guidelines on the amount of money schools should receive from teacher-training institutions for their contribution to courses. Universities and polytechnics, which run most of the courses, warned of widespread closures of education departments if they were forced to pass to schools most of their income from training courses. Mr David Hart, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers yesterday accused the government of an incoherent approach to the future organisation of schools. He said ministers kept changing their minds on such key issues as selection at the age of 11 or whether to allow mass opting-out of schools from council control.</p>

			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / Germany's cool diplomat moves on MR John Major, the UK prime minister, recently invited him to 10 Downing Street to say a special goodbye. The Sun, Britain's raucously xenophobic best-selling daily paper, saluted him as 'a gem' in a farewell editorial. (It also misspelled his name.) 'He's been a great success at a very difficult time. He's a harmoniser,' says Sir Sigmund Sternberg, a member of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, which - highly unusually - hosted a reception to bid him auf Wiedersehen. The man they are talking about is Mr Hermann von Richthofen, Germany's ambassador to the UK. After a hectic 4 1/2 -year tenure, and plenty of practice in weathering diplomatic squalls, he leaves London today to become his country's ambassador to Nato. Mr von Richthofen has made an impact for two reasons. First, he has succeeded in presenting united Germany's human face not just to officials but also to a broad cross-section of the British public. In incidents ranging from disputes over German reunification with Mrs Margaret (now Baroness) Thatcher to last autumn's row over Britain's exit from the exchange rate mechanism, Mr von Richthofen has kept his cool under fire. In his Belgravia residence, Mr von Richthofen calls 'rock solid' the general state of Anglo-German relations. 'We have had some irritations and some disturbances, but they always went away very quickly.' During his time in London, Germany has attracted flak for being too aggressive - and also for not being aggressive enough. In 1991, in a unique interview with the Sun, the ambassador defended his compatriots from charges of being 'cowards' during the Gulf war, where Germany played a conspicuously dormant role. Since the ambassador appreciates British humour, he says he 'saw the funny side' of his portrayal in the newspaper under the headline 'The Hun meets the Sun'. His worst moments, he says, came amid the recriminations after Britain's ERM exit last September. 'When the Bundesbank was under unjust attack, you ask yourself what have you done that you're so badly understood.' He bristles slightly at the memory of his brusque invitation to explain to the Foreign Office the leaking to the press of a document giving the Bundesbank's version of events. In spite of this episode, Mr von Richthofen says the Germans can learn from the British 'to be more relaxed, more natural, not too pushy'. What can Britain learn from Germany? The UK should pay more attention to manufacturing industry and vocational training, the ambassador says, giving engineers 'a higher position in the elite'. Britain would also benefit from decentralisation. 'Giving regions and municipalities more autonomy - this could also be something you could learn.' West Germany was established as a federal state after the second world war partly as a result of British policy, Mr von Richthofen points out. He adds a finely-weighed ounce of diplomatic judgment: 'We took your advice. But, because of your different traditions, you didn't follow it up in your own country.'</p>

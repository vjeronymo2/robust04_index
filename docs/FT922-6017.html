			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Evered finance director resigns Mr John Ford, finance director of Evered Bardon, the aggregates group, since September 1985, has resigned. Mr Peter Tom, group chief executive, said Mr Ford's departure reflected Evered's current policy of consolidation after rapid expansion in the late 1980s. 'John is a financial director more suited to acquisitions. He wanted to go off and do other things. We've parted the best of friends,' he said. In February, Evered announced the disposal of two non-core businesses, and three others in the US are up for sale. Cash raised will be used to reduce gearing from 70 per cent towards 40 per cent.</p>

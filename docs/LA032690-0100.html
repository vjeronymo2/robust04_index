			<p><P> March 26, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> SEXUAL MUTILATOR GETS 130 YEARS  </P> <P> A man convicted of raping and sexually mutilating a 7-year-old boy was  sentenced today to more than 130 years in prison, three times the standard term  for the crime.  </P> <P> In sentencing Earl Shriner, Pierce County Superior Court Judge Thomas R.  Sauriol said the case left him more troubled and outraged than any in his  37-year legal career.  </P> <P> "I don't think that I have ever heard of a case that borders on extreme cruelty  more than this one," Sauriol said.  </P> <P> Shriner, 40, has a long history of violence toward young people.  </P> <P> He was convicted Feb. 7 of first degree attempted murder, two counts of  first-degree rape and first-degree assault. The child was choked and sexually  mutilated in the attack May 20 in a wooded area near his south Tacoma home.  </P> <P> The boy's mother has said her son continues with his recovery, including  reconstructive surgery. A trust fund of hundreds of thousands of dollars that  poured in after the attack on the boy is paying for the surgery.  </P></p>

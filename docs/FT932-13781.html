			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / World Trade News: American business welcomes EC pact THE US-EC procurement pact, agreed yesterday, can be seen as offering considerably more than half a loaf for both sides. The US is still to impose sanctions, as required by Congress under US law, for the EC's failure to remove discriminatory provisions to US telecommunications companies in the utilities directive. However, the retaliation will be minuscule compared with the billions of dollars in contracts now open to bidding by companies from both sides. US companies, it is estimated, will gain Dollars 20bn (Pounds 13bn) in bidding opportunities in the market for heavy electrical equipment. EC companies will gain Dollars 5bn-Dollars 10bn in opportunities as a result of the US waiver of Buy American requirements imposed in bidding by the Tennessee Valley Authority and other federal power administrations. The US has also agreed to allow EC companies to bid without discrimination on contracts issued by the Departments of Energy and Transportation and the US Army Corps of Engineers. Both sides agreed to extend the protection of the Gatt government procurement code to each other's services providers - which opens up the bidding process in a fair, transparent process. Despite their failure to resolve totally the telecommunications issue, the agreement can be considered a significant achievement for the negotiating skills of both Sir Leon Brittan and Mr Mickey Kantor, the top EC and US trade officials, in their first crisis since taking office in January. At the end, the two men seemed to have attained a close personal rapport which they will need to settle other bilateral disputes and to bring the Uruguay Round to a successful conclusion this year. US company spokesmen yesterday were declaring the deal a breakthrough. A US trade official said: 'From our perspective opening this (electrical equipment) market is historic. It has been a trade objective of the US government since 1976.' 'Our companies are saying this is very positive,' said Mr Harry Freeman, executive director of the MTN coalition which lobbies for the Uruguay Round. 'Two tough negotiators working on tough issues have made some real progress. I feel much better about the whole EC relationship and the prospects for the Gatt than I have in a long time.' 'If this means that we can now move toward seriously winding up the Gatt round, we are overwhelmed and very pleased,' said Mr Will Berry, president of the European-American Chamber of Commerce. 'If this, however, remains a distraction and an obstacle to conclusion of the Gatt, we would be disappointed.' Company representatives yesterday, briefed on the progress made in the talks on a tariff reduction package for the Uruguay Round, were enthusiastic about the heavy schedule of talks agreed. These are designed to get a market access deal approved by the Group of Seven industrialised countries to Geneva in July.</p>

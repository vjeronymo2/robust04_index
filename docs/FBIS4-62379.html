As many people know, at issue is the second move for the  Russian Press House from premises where nearly 40 mass media  editorial offices operate.    The document states that the new move has paralyzed the work  of dozens of editorial offices. The collectives are incurring  losses running into millions. The children's newspaper GLAGOL  has been forced to announce closure. The board of the "Echo of  Moscow" joint-stock company made a decision on liquidating the  "Echo Moskvy" radio station if the losses and outlays are not  paid. In its appeal the Judicial Chamber urges the organs of  state power "to find a wise solution."</p>

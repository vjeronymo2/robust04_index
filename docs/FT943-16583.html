			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / Business Travel (Update): Sunshine service American Airlines is to stop operating its daily service between Glasgow and Chicago on a year-round basis, writes James Buxton. The service, using a Boeing 767, will end on November 2 and resume in mid-May next year for six months. American says that, although summer holiday traffic is good, the service has lost more than Dollars 3.5m each winter, making it unprofitable overall. The decision is seen as a blow to transatlantic air services from Scotland.</p>

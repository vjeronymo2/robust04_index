			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / Government Bonds: Retreat by bunds drags European prices lower German government bond prices were again on the retreat yesterday, driving other European markets down with them, as fresh data pointing to strong economic growth reinforced fears that interest rates in Germany have reached their low point in the current cycle. West German gross domestic product grew 0.5 per cent in the first quarter, or 2.1 per cent year-on-year, suggesting that economic growth is exceeding economists' expectations. The data follows the recent upward revision of growth by the OECD, which now has a target of 1.8 per cent for the pan-German economy this year. However, Mr Ken Wattret, an international economist at Midland Global Markets, said that traders had ignored some positive elements for the market. 'We believe the recovery is export-led, so the Bundesbank will continue to support the recovery with rate cuts,' he said, adding that the detailed figures back up this view. However, the negative reaction to the data also reflects the generally bearish sentiment overhanging European bond markets. The German market failed to take any comfort from the downward revision of M3 money supply in April to 15.4 from the 15.8 per cent. Dealers said that unemployment data was ignored by the market, as it is not strictly relevant to the interest rate outlook. The September German bund future on Liffe ended down 0.32 point at 92.27. UK government bonds showed further weakness yesterday in a continuation of the trend seen in recent weeks. With no new economic data published yesterday analysts saw no reason for investors to change their view of the market's prospects, and gilts drifted lower with other European markets. 'The underlying sentiment is still shot to bits,' said one analyst. 'Most institutional fund managers are optimistic but that is a long way from being willing to put money into the market. They don't want to take that risk.' Traders reported some profit-taking and said that there was disappointment that no further headway had been made after the rally last week. 'Quite a lot of money was spent last week and the UK rallied more than the other European markets. It was oversold and it's now reached fair value, which means that prop has gone now,' said Mr Bob Dobson, head of gilt sales at Daiwa Europe. Analysts said today's industrial production figures and the outcome of the European elections would be important for gilts. 'If the Tories do slightly better than expected, then the market may get a bit of a boost,' said Mr Ian Shepherdson, UK economist at Midland Global Markets. The long gilt future was down 1 3/32 point at 100 5/8 in late trading. French government bonds moved slightly lower yesterday in trading dominated by movements in the German bond market. Analysts said sentiment still remained negative. 'Both France and Germany are cheap but we are still going to see continued selling,' said one trader. Mr Julian Callow, an economist at Kleinwort Benson, said that tomorrow's industrial production figures and consumer price data due on Friday could provide further signs of strengthening economic recovery. US Treasury bonds drifted lower in light trading yesterday as the market paused after a two-session rally. Late in the day, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  11/32 at 87 27/32 , with the yield rising to 7.251 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was unchanged at 100 3/16 , to yield 5.755 per cent. Early on, prices moved modestly lower as traders followed through on a weakening trend in overnight trading of US securities in Tokyo. During mid-morning, bonds gradually clawed their way back, though there was no new economic news or overriding technical conditions to guide the activity. Action in the commodity and foreign exchange markets was generally featureless, but not unfavourable. Still, prices ebbed for a second time near midday and held fast at the lower levels during the afternoon. The next significant event on the economic calendar is the release of May producer price data on Friday, followed by consumer price figures next Monday. Tame readings on inflation are expected in both reports. Economists are forecasting a 0.2 per cent increase in the PPI, following a slight decline the previous month.</p>

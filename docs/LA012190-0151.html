			<p><P> January 21, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NHL ALL-STAR GAME;  </P> <P> PLAYERS GET TO SHOW OFF THEIR USUAL SKILLS TODAY  </P> <P> It was supposed to be Wayne vs. Mario.  </P> <P> Instead, it has become Bernie vs. Bruce.  </P> <P> But despite all the attention centered on the trading Saturday of Bernie  Nicholls to the New York Rangers by Kings' owner Bruce McNall, they are still  going to stage an All-Star game.  </P> <P> This is the year, the NHL finally gets back on network television (Channel 4,  10:30 a.m.) after an absence of a decade.  </P> <P> This is the year Pittsburgh Penguin superstar Mario Lemieux hopes to get his  revenge on resident superstar Wayne Gretzky of the Kings. Gretzky's Campbell  Conference beat Lemieux's Wales Conference last year, 9-5, in Gretzky's  long-time home, Edmonton, with the former Oiler winning his second All-Star MVP  award.  </P> <P> And finally, this is the year the NHL joins its big-league brothers in other  sports by making the All-Star game a show. It has been moved from its former  midweek spot to a two-day weekend event, complete with an old-timers' game and  skills contests on Saturday, just like the NBA.  </P> <P> The old-timers began Saturday's events at the Civic Arena in front of 16,236  fans, the record for a hockey game in Pittsburgh.  </P> <P> The Wales Conference old-timers beat their Campbell counterparts, 7-1, led by  Steve Shutt, a former King and Montreal Canadien, and Syl Apps Jr., a former  New York Ranger, King and Penguin, with two goals each.  </P> <P> In the puck-control relay race, the Campbell team of Gretzky, Kevin Lowe  (Edmonton), and Doug Smail (Winnipeg) won.  </P> <P> The hardest shot was hit by the Campbell's Al Iafrate (Toronto), clocked at 96  m.p.h.  </P> <P> The rapid-fire competition was won by the Wales, led by Joe Sakic (Quebec),  Shayne Corson (Montreal) and Kevin Hatcher (Washington), who each connected on  two shots out of five.  </P> <P> The speed skating event went to Mike Gartner (Minnesota) of the Campbell, who  hit 28.1 m.p.h.  </P> <P> Accuracy shooting (hitting targets with a puck) went to the Wales, led by Ray  Bourque (Boston), who hit four of seven.  </P></p>

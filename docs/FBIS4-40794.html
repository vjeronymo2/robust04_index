			<p>BFN     [Text] Bishkek, June 10, RIA -- A representative NATO  delegation, headed by General P. Karstens, supreme allied  commander Europe, intends to visit the air force base in the  Kirghiz [Kyrgyz] capital and aviation units in the suburbs of  Bishkek. The delegation arrived in the republic yesterday  evening.    According to the official version of the Kirghiz Defence  Ministry's press centre, during its meetings with the republican  leadership and with the heads of the Defence Ministry, the sides  will discuss the prospects of the development of equitable and  mutually advantageous relations and business contacts.    However, some local observers assert that one of the  subjects  of the discussions will be the deployment of an air force base  of the Atlantic bloc in Kirghizia [Kyrgyzstan]. This explains  the delegation's interest in aviation installations.</p>

			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / Finance and the Family: Making the most - Annuities If a couple retires, each spouse having accumulated their own pension funds, the question always arises: should they buy a single or joint life annuity? Take a couple with Pounds 100,000 each in their pension funds. If the husband, aged 65, uses his Pounds 100,000 and buys a joint life annuity from Canada Life (see table), his gross annual annuity will be Pounds 9,234.48. If the wife, aged 63, uses her Pounds 100,000 to do likewise, hers will be Pounds 9,162.96. Should both buy single annuities with the same benefits, however, the husband would receive a gross annual income of Pounds 11,643.12 and the wife Pounds 9,951.48. So, the total gross annual income for the couple with a joint life scheme would be Pounds 18,397.44. And should one die before the other, the income would remain at this level until the survivor's death. But if, on the other hand, each bought a single life annuity, they would get an initial gross income of Pounds 21,594.60. Of course, the death of either partner would mean their portion of the income died with them. This means that if the husband died first, for example, she would be left with an income of Pounds 9,951.48 for the rest of her life. Even when there is a big difference between spouse's fund values, couples normally choose a combination of single and joint life annuities, with a reduced spouse's pension.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                          LATEST ANNUITY RATES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Level annuity  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Male age 55        Annuity            Female age 50    Annuity     Months movement    +3.7%                Months movement    +3.4%  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Equitable Life     Pounds 9,522.96    Scottish Widows  Pounds 8,500.08 Canada Life        Pounds 9,467.76    Royal Life       Pounds 8,367.25 Scottish Widows    Pounds 9,370.08    Sun Life         Pounds 8,358.48  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Male age 60        Annuity            Female age 60    Annuity     Months movement    +3.9%                Months movement    +2.3%  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Equitable Life     Pounds 10,445.04   Canada Life      Pounds 9,463.20 Canada Life        Pounds 10,344.36   Royal Life       Pounds 9,375.03 RNPFN              Pounds 10,229.00   Sun Life         Pounds 9,273.36  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Male age 70        Annuity            Female age 70    Annuity     Months movement    +4.2%                Months movement    +2.5%  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- RNPFN              Pounds 13,758.00   RNPFN            Pounds 11,825.00 Canada Life        Pounds 13,540.92   Canada Life      Pounds 11,701.44 Equitable Life     Pounds 13,397.04   Royal Life       Pounds 11,637.02  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Joint life level annuity - 100% spouse's benefit  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Male 60/Female 57  Annuity            Female 63/Male 65 Annuity     Months movement    +2.9%                Months movement    +2.7%  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Canada Life        Pounds 8,604.48   Canada Life       Pounds 9,234.48 Scottish Widows    Pounds 8,554.20   Royal Life        Pounds 9,115.93 Royal LIfe         Pounds 8,494.33   Sun Life          Pounds 9,050.16  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- All payments are monthly in advance.

			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / Banks urged to save Jubilee Line plan CANARY Wharf's admin-istrators will today make a last attempt to prevent the government shelving the plan to extend the Jubilee Underground line to east London. They will ask the 11 commercial bank creditors of the development to make a no-strings offer to the government of a Pounds 390m contribution to the Jubilee Line's Pounds 1.6bn costs. Separately, construction industry leaders warned yesterday against cancelling the extension. Mr Frank Kennedy, a director of Wimpey, a contractor bidding for Jubilee work, said: 'To scrap the project when the construction industry is on its knees would not just be brutal but extremely ill-judged.' Mr John Hackett, director-general of the Federation of Civil Engineering Contractors, said 4,000 construction jobs depended on the extension. Mr Denis Tunnicliffe, managing director of London Underground, said if transport ministers cancelled the project they 'will have to explain to the Public Accounts Committee why they have already allowed us to spend Pounds 120m on it'. Last week, the banks made an offer to the government conditional on the Department of the Environment renting a building at Canary Wharf. The government has consistently stressed that its commitment to build the Jubilee Line extension if the private sector contributes Pounds 400m should not in any way depend on government support, such as revenues from renting a building to civil servants. The banks' proposal involves paying Pounds 98m immediately and the rest over 25 years. The Treasury, which wants the line scrapped to reduce public expenditure, is unhappy about the absence of a guarantee from the banks for the later payments. The banks have told the government that if the later payments are not made it can have the undeveloped land around Canary Wharf. But undeveloped land in Docklands has a minimal value. One banker who will be at today's meeting said: 'We cannot drop the linkage between the Jubilee contribution and getting rents from the government. It is too important.' The administrators - three partners of the accountancy firm Ernst &amp; Young - have also yet to win bank support for proposals to keep Canary Wharf afloat if the Jubilee extension gets approval. They have told the government the banks would probably be prepared to provide Pounds 30m in new loans to Canary Wharf over the coming three years to maintain the standard of services at the 15 new office buildings. Some banks believe this would put the administrators under too little pressure to sell the project. The banks will also be given an evaluation by Goldman Sachs, US investment bank, on whether they should drop their offer to the government in favour of a separate highly complex offer to fund the Jubilee Line contribution which has been made by the European Investment Bank. A government official said the EIB offer, which can only be made formally if the 11 commercial banks agree, would probably be rejected.</p>

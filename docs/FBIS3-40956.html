This IZVESTIYA correspondent has learned that, at a  Ukrainian  Defense Ministry Collegium session 21 January devoted to the  training of military personnel in the country's higher  educational establishments and the strengthening of discipline  among the troops, Lieutenant General Vladimir Mikhtyuk,  commander of the Strategic Missile Forces 43d Missile Army  stationed in Vinnitsa, and Major General Nikolay Filatov,  commander of the 46th Missile Division from Pervomaysk in  Nikolayev Oblast, unexpectedly and without prior arrangement  took the Ukrainian military oath.    Major General Rustam Karimov, commander of the 19th Missile  Division stationed in Khmelnitskiy, refused to take the  Ukrainian oath at this collegium session and stated that he  would not even do so before his own combined unit -- where 40  percent of the officers do not want to swear an oath of  allegiance to a fatherland yet again. That accounts for 413 of  the 1,017 officers in the division. Of these, 354 want to move  to Russia for the rest of their service, while the others want  to be discharged to the reserve and go to live back home.    Given that, before last Friday, the leading personnel of the  missile army and missile divisions stationed in Ukraine as well  as the overwhelming majority of other missile officers had not  sworn loyalty to Ukraine, this step by the Defense Ministry  Collegium is being seen by some observers as a direct challenge  to the policy announced by President Leonid Kravchuk in the  sphere of his state's nuclear missile disarmament, and as an  attempt to complicate and delay this process as long as  possible, to make it as unpredictable as possible, and to  nullify cooperation with Russia in carrying out the START I and  II treaties.    As is well known, there are 176 strategic RS-18  liquid-propellant missiles (90 in Khmelnitskiy and 40 in  Pervomaysk) and RS-22 solid-propellant (all 46 in Pervomaysk)  launch systems with 1,250 nuclear warheads plus 650 air-launched  cruise missile assemblies [bloki] in Ukraine. The Strategic  Nuclear Forces Administrative Command and Control Center is  located there, and the creation of nuclear space forces has been  announced.    The elimination of the strategic nuclear complex along with  the country's fulfillment of its commitments under the Lisbon  Protocol to join the Nonproliferation Treaty as a nuclear-free  state represents for many Ukrainian generals -- particularly  those who had recently moved to top jobs in the Kiev Defense  Ministry -- the complete end of their careers. They will  naturally do all they can to prevent it.    Meanwhile the situation in the Ukrainian Missile Forces --  this is no secret to specialists -- remains very complex despite  all the reassuring statements from Ukrainian generals. Many  missile systems have come to the end of their warranty and  inspection and maintenance [reglamentnyy] servicing period. The  state does not have enough money to carry out the servicing.    In 1993 Ukrainian specialists stood down two RS-18 strategic  missile regiments in Pervomaysk and Khmelnitskiy (10 RS-18's  each). The nuclear warheads were dismantled and sent to  technical storage bases, the missiles were removed from their  silos, their oxidants and fuel were transferred to special  tanks, and the missiles were loaded onto railcars and prepared  for dispatch to "Yuzhmashzavod" in Dnepropetrovsk.  But each dismantled missile still contains up to 100 kg of a  highly toxic substance -- one of the components of the missile  fuel. The equipment to degasify them does not exist, nor does  the technology for processing the heptyl. The plant turned out  not to be ready to receive these missiles.    It was necessary to remove them from the railcars and  transfer the toxic liquids from the rail tanks into other  containers. The dismantling of obsolete [vysluzhivshikh svoi  sroki] missiles has been halted indefinitely. There are neither  the warehouses, nor the specialized transportation, nor the  funds to handle them. Officers are angry that they are being  forced to do such a dangerous and senseless job.    Their service conditions and their pay are far lower than in  Russia's Strategic Rocket Forces. For instance, a missile  division commander in Ukraine earns 2.2 million  coupons-karbovantsi a month. If this sum is expressed in  Russian rubles [R] at the actual exchange rate (24 to 1), it  turns out that a Ukrainian general is "valued" less than a  Russian lieutenant -- who earned around R100,000 in December  1993 and will have been earning 90 percent more as of January.  Moreover, last month Ukraine's missile troops received their  pay literally on the eve of the New Year, after major scandals  at the Finance Ministry, and have not yet seen any money this  January.</p>

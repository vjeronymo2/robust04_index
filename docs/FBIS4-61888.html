			<p>BFN     [Text] Dear listeners, we now present a report on the  latest situation in the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic [NKR] and the  border between Armenia and Azerbaijan.    It was hoped after Azerbaijan's disclosure that it agrees to  the protocol that was signed in Bishkek by the Russian  Federation and Kyrgyzstan that a cease-fire will be observed on  the front line and suitable conditions will be created for the  implementation of the measures that have been planned to end the  dispute. We wish to recall that the NKR leaders ordered their  defense units to cease firing on [words indistinct]. The  Armenian side has remained committed to that order and has  refrained from retaliating against the fire directed on the  Armenian defense positions in various parts of the front line.    However, it is common knowledge that Azerbaijan is not  interested in observing a cease-fire and suspending its military  operations. A significant difference exists between that  Republic's words and deeds. That viewpoint is confirmed by the  following:    Azerbaijan's troops intensely shelled NKR positions with  artillery units at 0600 today. Later, they attacked  (Vashkeravan) in the eastern sector of the front line. The NKR  Defense Army Press Service has reported that Azerbaijan's  military forces, supported by armored vehicles, also attacked  Yarymdzha in the northeastern sector of the front line at 1015.  A preparatory wave of artillery shelling preceded their  onslaught. According to the information we received at about  1100, the NKR defense units were successfully obstructing the  enemy's attacks.    Tension continues to exist in other parts of the front line.  However, the Armenian units, in an effort to avoid worsening the  situation and undermining the cease-fire agreement, have tried  not to return the fire of the enemy forces as much as possible.    According to the information we have received, an incident  did not occur on the border between Armenia and Azerbaijan until  this afternoon. However, the situation in the region is tense.    Will the agreement reached within NATO's framework for peace  also have a bearing on the NKR front line? Who knows?</p>

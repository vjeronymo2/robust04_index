			<p><P> October 28, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: TECHNICLONE GETS PATENT FOR TUMOR TREATMENT METHOD  </P> <P> Techniclone International Corp., a Tustin bioengineering firm, said it has  received a patent on a method that has potential for detecting and destroying  cancerous tumors in humans.  </P> <P> Called tumor necrosis technology (TNT), the procedure allows monoclonal  antibodies to penetrate to the interior of harmful tumors and destroy them.  Monoclonal antibodies are genetically engineered and can be grown in large  commercial volumes.  </P> <P> "One of the major obstacles to treating solid tumors has been an inability to  penetrate the interior of a tumor," said Lon H. Stone, Techniclone's chairman  and chief executive officer. "We have developed a technology that enables us to  take the monoclonal antibodies that we manufacture and introduce them into  patients as a diagnostic or therapeutic device."  </P> <P> Stone said the TNT antibodies were designed by scientists at the University of  Southern California to attach to dead cells within tumors. They carry a  radioactive atom that kills the surrounding malignant cells that are living and  multiplying.  </P> <P> Unlike other antibodies that attach only to a limited number of cancerous  tumors, the TNT antibodies will link to all kinds of tumors, Stone said.  </P> <P> Tests of the new procedure on animals have been completed at the University of  Southern California Norris Cancer Center, Stone said. The company received  clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in July to begin tests on  humans.  </P> <P> Stone said because the TNT research initially was funded by Techniclone, the  company owns the patent on the technology. He said Lederle Laboratories, a  division of American Cyanamid, has agreed to finance completion of the tests  required for FDA marketing approval. Stone said upon successful completion of  the tests, which he estimated could take three to four years, Techniclone would  manufacture the TNT monoclonal antibodies, which would be marketed by Lederle.  </P></p>

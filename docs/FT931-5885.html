			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / Canadian banks drop prime rate CANADIAN banks have dropped their prime lending rate by a quarter point to 6.25 per cent in response to big capital inflows and an accommodating monetary policy. The new level, which matches the lowest seen in the past 20 years, takes effect today and has been accompanied by a sharp rise in the Canadian dollar. The currency climbed above 80 US cents this week for the first time since last November, and advanced yesterday morning to 80.35 US cents, despite the prime cut. The Bank of Canada said yesterday that intervention to contain the rise of the currency resulted in a net increase of USDollars 636m in its foreign-currency reserves in February. Nervousness in the financial markets about Canada's economic and political prospects was evident at the time of last autumn's referendum on a new constitution. Then, banks pushed their prime rate as high as 9.75 per cent. However, investors have since been drawn by attractive yields on Canadian securities and a perception that the country's problems may be less severe than those of many other industrial nations. Canadian borrowers have been among this year's most active Euromarkets participants. Economists expect the prime rate to fall to at least 6 per cent and perhaps lower. But they caution that markets could be unsettled in coming months. The spring federal and provincial budget season is likely to see unexpectedly large budget deficits, which are widely recognised as Canada's most pressing economic problem. In addition, political uncertainty may rise again during the run-up to the general election, expected in the autumn.</p>

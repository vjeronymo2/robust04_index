			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / Leading Article: Monkey business THE MOST controversial aspect of yesterday's largely anodyne Queen's Speech may turn out to be its deregulation bill. Cutting red tape is important if business is to flourish. But repealing regulations, particularly those covering sensitive matters such as health and safety, could run into a host of difficulties. The GMB union has already condemned the deregulation initiative as giving business the 'freedom to kill'. It is therefore perhaps not surprising that ministers apparently intend to take so-called Henry VIII powers to scrap regulations without having to debate each change endlessly in the House of Commons. Mr Neil Hamilton, the rumbustious junior industry minister in charge of the deregulation initiative, says: 'We are planning to clear out the accumulated dross of a number of bills without seeking primary legislation which would clog up parliament.' Mr Hamilton, who describes himself as Mr Michael Heseltine's chief monkey, is to be commended for his enthusiasm. But his apparent desire to sweep away regulations with only scant reference to parliament is more questionable. It is not just that anything which smacks of rule by decree would in principle be objectionable. Ramming through deregulation in sensitive areas without effective parliamentary scrutiny could endanger the whole initiative if even a single death or serious injury could be plausibly traced to unthinking deregulation. Much, of course, depends on the details of the deregulation bill which is not yet public. While the new ministerial powers will be subject to some form of parliamentary process, the exact nature of that scrutiny is not clear. In particular, it is uncertain whether the government plans to use orders to repeal regulations which are written in primary legislation and whether a parliamentary debate would be automatic or only take place if a sufficient number of MPs called for one. One way of meeting the constitutional concerns might be to establish a new select committee or standing committee for deregulation. This would ensure more effective scrutiny than the current practice, where ministerial orders are debated in the middle of the night, if at all. It would also prevent the parliamentary timetable being snarled up by thousands of small measures. The government might still be concerned that populist MPs would insist on keeping regulations which it believed onerous and unnecessary. But that would be a small price to pay for putting the deregulation initiative on a solid footing.</p>

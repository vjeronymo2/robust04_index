			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / HK group plans Dollars 12.7bn power plants in India India said yesterday that Hopewell Holdings, the Hong Kong based group run by Mr Gordon Wu, is planning to build two power stations worth Dollars 12.7bn in what would be India's largest foreign investment. Although the scheme is at an early stage, the news will boost India'a efforts to promote confidence in the economic re-forms started three years ago. The announcement, made yesterday by Mr NKP Salve, power minister, comes a few days before the annual meeting in Madrid of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, where India's economy will come under scrutiny. Mr Salve said Hopewell's scheme would be the largest power project planned in India. Hopewell has yet to decide the sites for its power stations which would each consist of eight units of 660MW. They would come on stream in stages between 1999 and 2003 if Hopewell secures the necessary clearances by early next year. The stations would be coal-fired using Indian coal. Under a memorandum of understanding to be signed by Hopewell and Powergrid, a state owned power transmission undertaking, the output is to be sold to Powergrid which would sell the electricity to state electricity boards (SEBs). Hopewell would therefore avoid dealing directly with the loss making SEBs, which are subject political interference, notably over pricing. India has received about 100 offers from private groups to build power stations since it invited investment in the sector two years ago as part of its economic liberalisation programme. Seven schemes are in the final stages of preparation though none has yet received a final go-ahead from investors and bankers. In order to encourage investment the government is backing these seven schemes by offering guarantees that the SEBs will pay their bills. Turnover on India's bourses will more than triple over the next three years with their capitalisation doubling to Dollars 300bn, according to a study by Barclays de Zoete Wedd (Asia), Reuter reports from Bombay. 'Never since the East India Company landed 300 years ago has India been the object of as much foreign commercial interest as today,' said the study. BZW said India was at an early stage of the current business cycle. 'We see this driving strong earnings growth for at least the next three years,' according to the study made available to Reuters yesterday. It forecast that the 30-share index of the Bombay Stock Exchange, the largest of 23 India's bourses, would reach the 5,000 level by March. It was trading around 4,500 this week, down slightly from its September 12 record close of 4,628.57. India has been one of Asia's most attractive emerging markets this year, rising some 34 per cent since January. But BZW cautioned that state elections in December and early 1995 would create some uncertainty in the market, but would not be a long-term factor.</p>

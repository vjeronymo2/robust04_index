			<p><P> December 5, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF : FATHERS OF SLAIN STUDIO GUARDS SUE NEW  MEXICO  </P> <P> The fathers of two Universal Studios guards killed by a man accused in the  previous murders of three people in Albuquerque have filed suit against the New  Mexico state Department of Public Safety and Albuquerque police.  </P> <P> The wrongful death lawsuit was filed in state court in Albuquerque on behalf of  the fathers of Armando Torres and Jeren Beeks.  </P> <P> The two were shot to death by Nathan Trupp at the movie studio in Universal  City while New Mexico officials were looking for Trupp in connection with three  murders at an Albuquerque bagel shop.  </P> <P> The lawsuit contends that the Albuquerque Police Department, the Public Safety  Department and their officers failed to share information in a timely fashion,  which would have led to Trupp's arrest before he left Albuquerque. City Atty.  David Campbell said his office would mount a vigorous defense.  </P> <P> In May, Trupp, 43, was found not guilty by reason of insanity in the Universal  Studios slayings.  </P></p>

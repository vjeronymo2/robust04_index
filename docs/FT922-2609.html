			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / BIS Annual Report: Warning on financial markets - Costs of liberalisation 'underestimated by developed world' THE developed world has underestimated the costs of liberalising its financial markets, the BIS annual report says. Governments must take steps to tackle the problems triggered by liberalisation, for example supervision of financial groups which are outside the regulatory framework. Also, authorities should try to develop new systems of crisis management which might be needed to tackle unexpected events such as stock market crashes whose impact may be heightened by looser regulation. According to the bank, the looser shackles covering financial and banking activities in many nations offer 'major opportunities but also commensurate risks'. Not enough has been done to tackle these last areas. A particular problem is the surge in volume of money transferred among financial groups across national borders. As a result, the banks involved in these transfers 'now incur unprecedented . . . liquidity and credit exposures, potentially on a larger scale than the exposures traditionally captured in their balance sheets and often less closely monitored and controlled.' The bank says fluctuations in the market price of assets is an important source of potential shocks to the financial system, which can take the form of events such as the 1987 stockmarket crash. The BIS said that many potential problems in financial markets had stemmed from 'the growing complexity of organisational structures typified by the emergence of national and international financial conglomerates'. Such organisations were often difficult for individual authorities in a single country to monitor efficiently - in which case greater pooling of information on supervisory activities should be agreed by governments. According to the BIS, the recent BCCI scandal represents one example where 'banking industry financial globalisation has allowed ample scope for the creation of opaque corporate structures.' It adds: 'Under these conditions the evaluation of risks . . . becomes considerably more difficult.' Governments need to co-ordinate their supervisory activities by, for instance, setting up schemes to share out potential financial losses. Also, individual institutions should build into their own operations a greater awareness of the risks triggered by deregulation. The report said that greater safeguards on supervision should focus on four areas: Prudential regulation and supervision of individual institutions such as through guidelines on capital standards. New checks on the design of large and complicated financial systems such as payment and settlement networks, with a view to reducing the chances of large sums of money being put at risk by events such as a reduction in the market price of financial instruments. Crisis management techniques under which authorities might be able to intervene to reduce the effects of events such as stock market crashes. Achieving the right balance between government involvement and instituting discipline in markets to minimise financial risks.</p>

			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / Survey of Derivatives (16): How borrowers cut funding costs  -Interest rate swaps / A look at an essential tool of risk management As an essential tool of risk management as well as a means of reducing funding costs, both exchange-traded and over-the-counter interest rate swaps have experienced strong growth in recent years and are now widely used by corporate treasurers. The amount of interest rate swaps outstanding totalled Dollars 6,177bn at the end of 1993, according to the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (Isda), with market growth of 60 per cent last year. The benefits of using such sophisticated derivative instruments have doubtless continued to be appreciated by borrowers in this year's difficult market conditions. With investor sentiment likely to remain bearish and markets volatile, with business becoming ever more global, and in spite of heavy losses incurred by some companies on certain derivative contracts, the growth of the interest rate swaps markets looks set to continue. An interest rate swap allows counterparties to exchange the risk associated with borrowing funds at either a fixed or a floating interest rate. For example, one borrower may be able to raise funds relatively cheaply in the fixed-rate market. However, he may require floating-rate funds. He can therefore use a swap to borrow at a fixed rate of interest but exchange the proceeds with another borrower who has a comparative advantage in the floating-rate sector. In this way, corporate treasurers can significantly cut the costs of funding and at the same time manage their exposure to interest rate movements across a wide range of currencies. The role of the banks in this equation has traditionally been to match counterparties with offsetting borrowing requirements, although as the liquidity of the market has risen, their role is becoming more that of a market maker, making prices in the different swap products. Although most swap trades are between counterparties exchanging fixed- and floating-rate risk in a single currency, it is also possible to swap between currencies. This allows borrowers to exploit the comparative advantage they may have in a particular currency sector. For example, a borrower may raise fixed interest rate D-Marks but swap them for floating-rate dollars. According to Isda, there was Dollars 900bn of currency swaps outstanding by the end of 1993. A wide variety of swap products can be purchased from and traded on many of the world's derivative exchanges. Large and highly liquid, the exchanges allow investors to switch their exposures from one market to another in a matter of moments. However, being standardised products, exchange-traded swaps do not always meet users' exact needs. Increasingly, therefore, it is to the over-the-counter market that corporate treasurers are turning for their swap needs. In this market, where the degree of innovation in types of new products has been staggering, intermediaries such as banks offer products which are tailored to borrowers' particular requirements. In an attempt to compete, exchanges have developed more customised exchange products such as Flex contracts in Chicago. However, to a large extent they remain eclipsed by the variety and flexibility in terms of maturity and structure of instruments that the OTC market can offer. Nevertheless, exchanges continue to play an important role in the swaps market. This is because of their size and liquidity, and not least because they are used by corporate managers to hedge their positions in the OTC market and by the banks, the providers of the OTC instruments, as protection against their exposure. One of the main reasons for the rise of the interest rate swaps market has been the increasing international basis on which business is being conducted. As barriers between markets, which had forced both investors to rely on limited domestic sectors, have been removed over the past 10 years, many large institutions have begun to focus increasingly on investment opportunities available in new overseas markets. As a result, their funding needs and their income streams have become more varied. Alongside these developments have been the technological advancements which have made almost instant access to these new overseas markets possible. A greater understanding among users of how derivative products work and a greater appreciation of the value that they can add has also played a significant role in allowing the market to develop. 'Corporate managers are becoming more and more comfortable with the concept of risk management,' said Stephen Compton, head of interest rate derivative trading at Citibank in London. 'The large corporates are now using swap products in a far more sophisticated way and are exploiting the instruments' full potential.' Bad publicity surrounding the heavy losses on some derivative contracts incurred by companies such as Germany's Metallgesellschaft, and Proctor &amp; Gamble, and the charges that some banks are marketing swaps in an irresponsible manner has done little to dampen market activity. Rather, according to many market participants, it has focused attention on the benefits that derivatives have to offer. 'The publicity has been a constructive warning to the market,' said Mr Compton. 'The result has been a real push to best-practices.' Germany's Metallgeselschaft had to be rescued by its banks when a trading subsidiary incurred estimated losses of Dollars 1bn on oil derivatives. Proctor &amp; Gamble has filed a lawsuit against Bankers Trust after losing more than Dollars 100m on swaps sold by the bank. P&amp;G claims that Bankers Trust did not 'accurately and fully' disclose information about the derivatives contract. Despite these setbacks, the development of the interest rate swaps market looks set to continue, particularly in emerging sectors such as the Greek drachma market, which has witnessed strong growth recently. There will also be a continued need for sophisticated instruments while market conditions worldwide remain difficult, which looks likely. What is more, derivatives do not rely solely on price rises - they can be used to exploit bearish as well as bullish price movements, so there is no logical reason why activity should drop off as market conditions worsen. 'The development of the interest rate swaps market will certainly continue,' said Jim L'Estrange, head of marketing for derivatives in Europe at Citibank in London. 'Off-balance sheet risk management tools remain the most efficient way of managing exposures, as well as enabling people to borrow where it is cheapest and then convert the funds to where they were wanted in the first place.'  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                       OVER-THE-COUNTER BUSINESS              Swaps outstanding as of December 31, 1993  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                        INTEREST RATE SWAPS  ---------------------------------------------------------------------   USDollars       % change      Currency as              Currency   m equiv         from year-    percent of                   end 1992      total  --------------------------------------------------------------------- 2,457,043           39.6          39.8              US dollar (Dollars)   131,130           26.2           2.1     Australian dollar (ADollars)    31,102          119.5           0.5              Belgian franc (BFr)   437,138           48.3           7.1        British sterling (Pounds)   126,309           28.1           2.0       Canadian dollar (CDollars)     9,110           79.3           0.1               Danish krone (DKr)   629,724           82.8          10.2                Deutschemark (DM)    52,052           66.8           0.8               Dutch guilder (Fl)   133,133           43.0           2.2     European currency unit (Ecu)   456,371          228.1           7.4               French franc (FFr)     9,467           90.5           0.2     Hong Kong dollar (HKDollars)   162,042          178.3           2.6                 Italian lira (L) 1,247,444           76.7          20.2                 Japanese yen (Y)     6,209          370.0           0.1   New Zealand dollar (NZDollars)    42,115          176.6           0.7             Spanish peseta (Pta)    32,049           81.0           0.5              Swedish krona (SKr)   182,207           29.8           2.9                Swiss franc (SFr)    32,707           47.1           0.5                 Other currencies 6,177,352           60.4         100.0                           TOTALS  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                             CURRENCY SWAPS  ---------------------------------------------------------------------   USDollars       % change      Currency as              Currency   m equiv         from year-    percent of                   end 1992      total  ---------------------------------------------------------------------   320,041            3.6          35.6              US dollar (Dollars)    46,347           -3.4           5.2     Australian dollar (ADollars)     6,793           30.7           0.8              Belgian franc (BFr)    44,143           10.0           4.9        British sterling (Pounds)    35,333          -22.2           3.9       Canadian dollar (CDollars)     3,255          115.2           0.4               Danish krone (DKr)    69,689           30.7           7.7                Deutschemark (DM)     9,747           31.4           1.1               Dutch guilder (Fl)    36,755            2.2           4.1     European currency unit (Ecu)    22,877           44.6           2.5               French franc (FFr)     2,086          185.6           0.2     Hong Kong dollar (HKDollars)    22,720            3.3           2.5                 Italian lira (L)   158,795            2.9          17.7                 Japanese yen (Y)     2,436           33.6           0.3   New Zealand dollar (NZDollars)    16,998          -15.4           1.9             Spanish peseta (Pta)    17,202           15.2           1.9              Swedish krona (SKr)    73,272            5.4           8.1                Swiss franc (SFr)    11,133          -26.9           1.2                 Other currencies   899,618*           4.6         100.0                           TOTALS  --------------------------------------------------------------------- * Totals adjusted to account for both sides of a currency swap  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: International Swaps and Derivatives Association  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

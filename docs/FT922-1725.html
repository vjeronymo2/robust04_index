			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / Food: Alf Tupper's FT treat - Street food AS A BOY I encountered fish and chips twice a week. On Tuesday evenings, after cub scouts, at least 20 of us would invade the local chippy. On Fridays my comic would arrive, containing the latest episode in the life of Alf Tupper, the long-distance runner who vanquished all-comers on a diet of fish and chips. I never fell for the life-enhancing properties of this wonderful combination, but I have never forgotten just how satisfying good fish and chips can be anywhere, from fairly sublime locations (on a beach near Sydney, in a garden in Auckland, even a romantic fish and chip lunch in England at the Flora Tea Rooms in Dunwich, Suffolk) to the more mundane repast eaten before or after the cinema. I have developed tastes for more sophisticated fish and chips. At The Square, London SW1 (tel:071-839-8787) I recently ate a very good rendition re-christened 'crusted turbot on a bed of creamed potatoes' and, at the occasional cocktail party, I have enjoyed a tiny portion of fish and chips served inside a miniature FT. But these more sophisticated dishes only highlight why fish and chips work so well together. When the fish is fresh, its taste (even that of the humble cod or plaice) is so delicate that it can easily be overpowered. Potatoes, simply cooked, are the perfect accompaniment. One of England's finest fish chefs, Richard Stein, of The Seafood Restaurant in Padstow, Cornwall, acknowledges this in his book English Seafood Cookery (Penguin Pounds 7.99), and simultaneously gives a recipe for coq d'or potatoes - thickly sliced potatoes covered in chicken stock and baked in the oven, a most delicious accompaniment to fish. Convenience is almost as compelling a reason as taste for visiting a good fish and chip shop. A brief spell in the kitchens of Brady's, a fish restaurant in Wandsworth, south London, convinced me just how hot, sticky and potentially dangerous this relatively simple cooking process can be. In front of two fryers containing vegetable oil at 375`F - most chip shops now use good quality vegetable oil rather than animal fats - you must skin and bone all your fish (that is how most customers like it). For the chips you must secure a reliable supply of Maris Piper potatoes  - according to Luke Brady those grown in Essex are far more suitable for the fryer than ones from Scotland. Put them through a mechanical peeler, rinse them twice, cut them mechanically, rinse them twice again and then blanch for 60 seconds in hot oil - making sure the temperature does not drop (the biggest cause of soggy chips). Preparing two 55lb bags, enough for 70-80 customers, will take three to four hours. To cook the fish, dip both sides in what the trade calls 'horseshoe', ground up rice husks, then in a flour and water batter. Cook it in the oil for 3-4 minutes. The chips need less time but both must be drained before being served. The final ingredient, mushy peas, might not be to everyone's taste but they are still popular and any chippy's most profitable line. A 25lb sack of marrowfat peas costs Pounds 4 but will generate 200 portions at 60p each, having been soaked overnight, cooked in sugar and salt with the assistance of cooking tablets which help to break the peas down. Behind the counter, it was the smell from the continuous frying that I was not prepared for. According to Luke Brady, you grow accustomed to it although you need to change your clothes after every service. But it will take more than that to put me off fish and chips. Only if a really soggy version, wrapped in one of my articles, were served to me would I consider transferring my allegiance. Among the best fish and chip shops and restaurants in London are: Nautilus, NW6; Sea Shell, NW1; Bradys SW18; Geale's W8; Seafresh SW1; Maxwell's of Ealing, NW3; Harry Ramsden's, Heathrow Airport Terminal 1 and in Guiseley, Yorkshire (0943-874641).</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report under the "NEGA Reports" rubric: </F> "Azerbaijan"]    [Text] The Azerbaijani president has not yet signed an  edict on lowering the quorum in parliament. So, an appeal by 28  deputies to Geydar Aliyev requesting that the requisite quorum  at the National Assembly be reduced from 34 to 26 deputies has  so far gone unanswered; the measure is designed to help  circumvent the discussion of the Bishkek protocol that has been  demanded in an ultimatum by a group of the parliament's  opposition members, who walked out from the previous meeting for  an indefinite period.    KHABAR-SERVICE's correspondent learned this from sources at  the presidential staff. The news agency also reports that  although such an edict will be unlawful, Geydar Aliyev is  inclined to grant the request of the parliamentary majority, and  the document is expected to be signed in the next few days.</p>

At least 50 percent of the remainder (the local share) must be derived from sources other than Federal funds or revenues of the system; and up to half of the local share may be derived from other Federal funds. For purposes of determining local share for section 18 operating assistance, the term ``Federal funds or revenues'' does not include funds received pursuant to a service agreement with a State or local service agency or a private social service organization. Nonregulatory guidance is contained in FTA Circular 9040.1B, section 18 Program Guidance and Grant Application Instructions, Chapter III, section 7.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;19.24  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Program income.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Federal awarding agencies shall apply the standards set forth in this section in requiring recipient organizations to account for program income related to projects financed in whole or in part with Federal funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Except as provided in paragraph (h) of this section, program income earned during the project period shall be retained by the recipient and, in accordance with Federal awarding agency regulations or the terms and conditions of the award, shall be used in one or more of the ways listed in the following.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Added to funds committed to the project by the Federal awarding agency and recipient and used to further eligible project or program objectives.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Used to finance the non-Federal share of the project or program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Deducted from the total project or program allowable cost in determining the net allowable costs on which the Federal share of costs is based.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) When an agency authorizes the disposition of program income as described in paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section, program income in excess of any limits stipulated shall be used in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) In the event that the Federal awarding agency does not specify in its regulations or the terms and conditions of the award how program income is to be used, paragraph (b)(3) of this section shall apply automatically to all projects or programs except research. For awards that support research, paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall apply automatically unless the awarding agency indicates in the terms and conditions another alternative on the award or the recipient is subject to special award conditions, as indicated in &sect;19.14.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) Unless Federal awarding agency regulations or the terms and conditions of the award provide otherwise, recipients shall have no obligation to the Federal Government regarding program income earned after the end of the project period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f) If authorized by Federal awarding agency regulations or the terms and conditions of the award, costs incident to the generation of program income may be deducted from gross income to determine program income, provided these costs have not been charged to the award.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (g) Proceeds from the sale of property shall be handled in accordance with the requirements of the Property Standards (See &sect;&sect;19.30 through 19.37).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (h) Unless Federal awarding agency regulations or the terms and condition of the award provide otherwise, recipients shall have no obligation to the Federal Government with respect to program income earned from license fees and royalties for copyrighted material, patents, patent applications, trademarks, and inventions produced under an award. However, Patent and Trademark Amendments (35 U.S.C. 18) apply to inventions made under an experimental, developmental, or research award.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Section 4(a) of the Federal Transit Act, as amended, (49 U.S.C. app. 1603(a)) allows FTA recipients to retain program income for allowable capital or operating expenses, but program income may not be used to refund or reduce the local share of a grant. The section 16 and 18 programs, however, operate differently. Under the special authority to set appropriate terms and conditions for the section 16(b)(2) program, program income in the form of contract service revenue may be used as local share without a proportionate reduction in the Federal share. Similarly, section 18 allows the use of program income in the form of contract service revenue as local share without requiring a proportionate reduction in the Federal share. Grantees must account for program income in their accounting systems, which are subject to audit. The accounting system must be capable of identifying program income and the purpose for which it was used. Nonregulatory guidance is contained in FTA notice N 5.5005.1, Guidance on Program Income and Sales Proceeds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;19.25  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Revision of budget and program plans.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

They reported, according to AFP, that the column of nine  trucks with food and medicine is blocked in Novi Seher, 10  kilometers from Maglaj, and that the UN representative Larry  Hollingworth is negotiating its passage with the local HVO  commanders. They also said that the Bosnian Serb forces allowed  the convoy to pass through their territory without any problems.  UNHCR representatives in Sarajevo also warned about the  extremely difficult position of the 40,000 civilians in Maglaj  since the last convoy arrived there on October 25 last year.</p>

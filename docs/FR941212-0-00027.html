			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department gave an example in the NPRM how this language might be restrictive to fellows: ``For example, a faculty fellow who completed a 1-year retraining to have the skills required to incorporate geriatrics into course content and clinical rotations may discover 5 years later that another fellowship experience would provide the opportunity to develop research skills in geriatrics required to expand the scope and depth of practice-based geriatric research.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One respondent requested the ``removal of the 1-year fellowship [retraining] limit of Federal support for psychiatrists who wish to train other psychiatrists in geriatric psychiatry''. The respondent stated that this is a reasonable request as it would permit the training to fully meet the requirements of exposure to the physical and mental disabilities of a diverse population of elderly individuals. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department has not accepted this recommendation because the statute requires that the 2-year fellowship program be an internal medicine or family medicine fellowship program, not a psychiatry fellowship program. (See section 777(b)(3)(B) of the Act and &sect;57.4105(d) of the regulations.) However, psychiatrists are eligible to participate as fellows in the 2-year programs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to the changes proposed above, a number of technical, clarifying, and ministerial changes were included to conform the existing regulations with amendments made by Pub. L. 102&hyph;408. The Department also received a few comments on some of these technical changes. The Department's responses are also discussed below. These changes affecting the program for Faculty Training Projects in Geriatric Medicine and Dentistry are as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Revise the section number of the Act from ``789(b)'' to ``777(b)'' wherever it appears in subpart PP, as renumbered, and the United States Code citation from ``(42 U.S.C. 295g&hyph;9(b))'' to ``(42 U.S.C. 294o)'', in accordance with Pub. L. 102&hyph;408. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Revise &sect;57.4101, entitled `` <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> To what projects do these regulations apply?'',  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> by adding the words ``geriatric psychiatry'' to reflect statutory language which expands project support to include the training of physicians who plan to teach geriatric psychiatry. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Revise &sect;57.4102, entitled `` <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Definitions. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> '', to amend the following terms to: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. Remove the definition of `` <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Council <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> '' regarding the National Advisory Council on Health Professions Education, in accordance with Pub. L. 102&hyph;408. The statute repealed the Council effective October 1, 1992; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. Revise the phrase ``by an organized medical staff'' to ``by an organized health care staff'' at the end of the definition of `` <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Extended care facility <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> '' to clarify that staff of health care institutions includes nurses, physical therapists, social workers and other health care staff who provide ``medically-prescribed skilled nursing care or rehabilitative services''. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department received one comment regarding the proposed clarifying change to the phrase ``organized health care staff'' as having potential conflict with individual State laws or licensing authorities. It is the Department's view that the clarifying phrase includes medical staff along with all other health care professionals and should not be in conflict with any individual State laws or licensing authorities. Therefore, this amendment will remain as proposed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c. Revise the introductory text to the definition of `` <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Fellowship program <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> '' by removing the reference to a 1-year fellowship program which is no longer a statutory provision for project support; and revise paragraph (2) of the definition to reflect new statutory requirements for the training of dentists who have ``demonstrated a commitment to an academic career and who have completed postdoctoral dental training, including postdoctoral dental education programs or who have relevant advanced training or experience''. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department received favorable support for this change. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> d. Revise the section number of the Act in the definition of `` <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> School of medicine or school of osteopathic medicine <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> '' from ``701(5)'' to ``799(1)(E)'', in accordance with Pub. L. 102&hyph;408. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Amend &sect;57.4105, entitled `` <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Project requirements. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> '', to: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. Revise paragraph (d) regarding the requirement that projects be based in a graduate medical education program by adding the words ``or psychiatry'' after the phrase ``or in a department of geriatrics'' to reflect statutory language which expanded project support to include the training of physicians who plan to teach geriatric psychiatry. Paragraph (d) is further revised by removing the phrase ``in existence as of December 1, 1987'' at the end of the sentence, in accordance with Pub. L. 102&hyph;408; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. Revise paragraph (e) regarding the requirement that projects be staffed by at least two physicians in full-time teaching positions who have experience or training in geriatric medicine by adding the words ``or geriatric psychiatry'', in accordance with Pub. L. 102&hyph;408; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c. Revise the introductory text to paragraph (f) regarding the requirement that the project must provide fellows ``with training in geriatrics and exposure to the physical and mental disabilities of'' a diverse population of elderly individuals, to more appropriately reflect the language in Pub. L. 102&hyph;408. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Revise &sect;57.4106, entitled `` <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> How will applications be evaluated? <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> '', by: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. Removing the reference to the National Advisory Council on Health Professions Education, in accordance with Pub. L. 102&hyph;408, in paragraph (a) introductory text and revising the introductory text to reflect current statutory language regarding the evaluation and recommendation process of awarding grant applications; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. Adding a comma and the words ``psychiatry, or'' after the words ``geriatric medicine'' in paragraph (a)(5) to reflect statutory language which expanded training to include geriatric psychiatry. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

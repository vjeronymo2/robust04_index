			<p><P> May 18, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOREST LANDS  </P> <P> The Times offers incorrect information in its editorial on proposed federal  listing of the northern spotted owl as threatened ("Protection -- at Last," May  2) when it cites U.S. Forest Service estimates that only "2.7 million acres of  old-growth forest are left in Washington and Oregon." The correct figure is  that the agency reports more than 6 million acres in the national forests, and  more than half of this lies in areas that will never be harvested. An estimated  million more acres of old-growth timber are contained in national parks in the  two states.  </P> <P> Clearly, with such an abundant resource already preserved, options must exist  to accommodate both the owl and the timber-dependent communities of the region.  The Times also errs in blaming the decline in employment in the forest industry  on modernization. It was instead due to some mills closing down. The modernized  mills, rather than laying off people, are producing more product from the logs  they process. There is no prospect of running out of timber in the Pacific  Northwest. But by Forest Service estimates, federal listing of the owl is  expected to throw 250,000 people out of work in the small mill communities of  the region.  </P> <P> A mill shutting down in many of these little towns is utterly devastating.  People have to move away. Home values are destroyed. The tax base for schools  and municipal services is demolished. Surely it is time for some common sense  on this issue.  </P> <P> JOHN BENNETH  </P> <P> Regional Manager  </P> <P> American Forest Council  </P> <P> Portland, Ore.  </P></p>

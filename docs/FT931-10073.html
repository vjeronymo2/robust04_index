			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / The FT500 (28): Rough ride for car makers - Overcapacity is being exacerbated by the development of new plants by Japanese and traditional European producers / Motor industry EUROPEAN car makers suffered a tough ride in the equity markets in the second half of 1992 as investors began to focus on the difficult outlook for car sales in 1993. The share prices of the quoted volume car makers Volkswagen of Germany, Peugeot of France and Fiat of Italy all plunged in the final months of 1992, as industry forecasts of declining new car demand in western Europe became widespread. By 1993 most vehicle makers were facing extended periods of short-time working, profit margins were being squeezed and several car producers from Volvo and Saab in Sweden to Jaguar, Ford of Europe and Porsche, as well as truck makers such as Daf, Volvo, Iveco (Fiat) and Renault Vehicules Industriels were in loss. The problem of overcapacity is being exacerbated by the development of several new plants by Japanese car makers and by the traditional European producers. The generally bearish sentiments towards the volume car makers have also served to depress the share prices of the leading executive and luxury car makers Daimler-Benz and BMW, although BMW's much stronger performance in the market-place has helped to cushion the fall in its share price. In 1992, BMW outsold Mercedes-Benz in western Europe and in the US for the first time in its history. Mercedes-Benz is also facing a steep fall in orders for new commercial vehicles in Germany. All the leading quoted European car makers have lost ground in the FT500. Fiat was the most notable casualty dropping from 53rd to 94th in 1992, but Volkswagen has also fallen nine places to end up only slightly above Fiat at 87 in the list. Three of the leading volume car makers in Europe do not appear in the FT500. GM Europe and Ford of Europe are both wholly-owned by the US car makers, while the ownership of Renault is still dominated by the French state, which holds an 80 per cent stake. The remaining 20 per cent is held by Volvo of Sweden, Renault's partner in the far-reaching Franco-Swedish alliance. Renault has been actively cultivating the financial markets during the past year, however, and part of its equity could be floated eventually in the wake of the French general election in March. Mr Louis Schweitzer, Renault chairman and chief executive, is keen to deepen the existing alliance with Volvo, possibly into a full merger. While the vehicle makers have fallen from favour among investors, the automotive components suppliers have generally fared much better, although Pirelli and Continental, the Italian and German tyre makers, suffered a fall in their share prices in the last three months of 1992. By contrast Michelin, the French tyre maker, has held on to the impressive gains it made in the 18 months to the summer of 1992. Its share price has since marked time, but after the powerful recovery from a low of FFr58 in October 1990, Michelin has climbed more than 100 places in the FT500 to reach 107 in the list from 211 a year earlier. Valeo, the leading French automotive components maker, has also emerged strongly ahead of the pack during the past two years. It has jumped to 254 in the FT500 from 381 a year earlier, and analysts forecast that Valeo should continue to have more resilient earnings than most components suppliers in Europe in 1993. According to Mr Nick Snee, automotive analyst at SG Warburg in London, Valeo has market share leadership in many of its products, which should give it some ability to resist pricing pressures, as the vehicle assemblers squeeze prices in the face of declining volumes. At the same time Valeo 'took the decision at an early stage to cut costs, which is why its margins have risen over the last 18 months, while other suppliers have seen margins fall', says Mr Snee. Valeo is also in a phase of reducing its indebtedness after heavy investments in earlier years, which should also help to cushion its profits against the impact of falling sales volumes. New car sales staged an unexpected rally in December in several of the main volume markets in western Europe confounding leading car makers' more pessimistic forecasts. As a result new car sales in western Europe for the whole of 1992 were virtually unchanged from the previous year at 13.5m. The industry remains pessimistic about the outlook for new car sales in 1993, however, with most forecasts suggesting a decline of around 4 per cent. New car sales in western Europe have remained stable around 13.5m for the past four years to 1992, although the fortunes of individual markets - and therefore of individual car makers - have fluctuated greatly. Sales have only been kept at this record level, however, by the expansion of the western European market to include eastern Germany since mid-1990, as a result of reunification, which has helped to compensate for falls elsewhere. The starkest contrast in the fortunes of individual markets has been between the UK and Germany. New car sales have fallen by nearly a third in the UK in the face of the deep recession from the peak of 2.3m units in 1989 to only 1.59m in both 1991 and 1992. In Germany, where demand received an unprecedented boost from reunification, sales jumped by 46.9 per cent from 2.83m in West Germany in 1989 to 4.16m in unified Germany in 1991. The Volkswagen group of Germany, which includes Audi, Seat and Skoda, has established a convincing lead in the western European new car sales league. It was the best-selling car maker in western Europe in 1992 for the eighth year in succession. It boosted its market share to a record 17.5 per cent from 16.4 per cent a year earlier and established a commanding lead ahead of its nearest rival General Motors of the US. As the German market weakens this year VW's deep-rooted cost problems are becoming more apparent, however. According to a recent SG Warburg report on the world auto industry unit productivity at Volkswagen's domestic plants is no better than that achieved by its leading European rivals such as Peugeot and Renault in France, but its hourly labour costs are substantially higher and still rising. VW is finding it increasingly difficult to secure premium prices, and SG Warburg warns that 'unless VW can cut its cost-base, it faces a protracted period of inferior operating returns, at a time when its ambitious expansion programme has reduced financial income'. Fiat of Italy, which includes Lancia, Alfa Romeo and Ferrari, has been the main loser among the big six volume car makers in western Europe, however. It has slipped from second to fourth place behind VW, GM and the Peugeot group of France, which includes Citroen. Fiat's sales volume in western Europe fell by an estimated 7.4 per cent to 1.6m last year following an 8.1 per cent decline in 1991 and a 6 per cent fall in 1990. Its market share fell to only 11.9 per cent from 12.8 per cent in 1991, 14.2 per cent in 1990 and 14.9 per cent in 1989. In the market for executive and luxury cars in western Europe BMW of Germany outsold its arch domestic rival Mercedes-Benz for the first time in its history. BMW increased its sales by 7.2 per cent to around 443,000, while Mercedes-Benz was among the biggest losers last year with an estimated 8.6 per cent drop in sales to 413,000. With the market in western Europe weakening in 1993 Europe's hard-pressed luxury car makers can expect some relief from North America this year, however, where sales are beginning to recover from recession. In a virtually flat US car market last last year BMW increased its sales by 23.1 per cent to 65,691, while Mercedes-Benz raised its sales by 7.5 per cent to 63,312.</p>

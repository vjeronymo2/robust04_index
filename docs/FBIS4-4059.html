			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 26 (XINHUA) -- The legitimate rights  and interests of the vast number of laborers in China are being  better protected, as the system of labor dispute arbitration and  labor supervision is becoming fully-fledged.    According to the China Labor Development Bulletin issued  here  jointly today by the Ministry of Labor and the State Statistics  Bureau, arbitration committees for labor disputes at various  levels had by the end of last year been seized of 12,300  disputes, up 51.6 percent over the previous year.    Liu Guanxue, spokesman for the Labor Ministry, told  reporters  that Chinese laborers have now become more conscious of the  importance of self-protection. The labor departments, on the  other hand, are doing their best to step up labor protection by  all legal means.    The bulletin shows that the arbitration committees examined  and handled 11,400 labor disputes last year, some 92.2 percent  of the total.    At the same time, according to the spokesman, the labor  supervisory system has also been greatly strengthened. By now,  altogether 16 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities  nationwide have set up labor supervisory institutions.    They have established the system of mass-reporting of  illegal  labor activities and launched various forms of checks on labor  recruitment.    According to statistics from the provinces of Guangdong,  Sichuan and Zhejiang, the most labor-intensive areas in China,  the labor supervisory institutions cracked down on more than 100  illegal labor intermediary institutions in 1993, which  effectively maintains order in the state's labor markets.</p>

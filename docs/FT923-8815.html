			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / Italy boardroom reform ITALY'S new government yesterday sent the strongest signal to date of its determination to shake up and privatise the country's public sector by pushing through a revolutionary slimming-down of the boards of the country's four biggest state-owned companies. IRI, the biggest state holding company, ENI, the energy and chemicals concern, ENEL, the state electricity authority, and INA, the state insurance agency, will see their boards shrink to just three members. Only one member, the chairman, will remain a political appointment. A new position of chief executive will be created, to be occupied by the companies' current director-general, a non-political post. The third board member will be a senior civil servant from one of the key ministries involved in the privatisation process. The present chairmen, Mr Franco Nobili at IRI, Mr Gabriele Cagliari at ENI, Mr Franco Viezzoli at ENEL and Mr Lorenzo Pallesi at INA, will all retain their jobs, at least until the next shareholders' meetings in April. However, at a press conference last night, Mr Giuliano Amato, the prime minister, indicated the longer-term outlook for IRI and ENI in particular involved big changes, expecially disposals. Mr Amato, flanked by Mr Piero Barucci, treasury minister, Mr Franco Reviglio, budget minister, and Mr Giuseppe Guarino, industry minister, the chief architects of the privatisation drive, stressed that all four groups would eventually be sold to the public. In the case of IRI and ENI, Italy's two biggest public-sector industrial concerns, reducing losses in some subsidiaries would be a first step. Once quoted, the companies would be open to foreign alliances to improve their international coverage and would represent a 'new Italian national industry', he said. The new boards will replace the dozens of committees and executive groups, largely comprising political appointees, which have dominated the four companies in the past. ENI's main board has 15 members, mainly put forward by the governing parties; IRI has 14.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 23 KYODO -- Gaishi Hiraiwa, one of  Japan's key business moguls, on Wednesday [23 March] defended  the tight-fisted stance of management in this spring's wage  negotiations, which will likely result in the poorest-ever wage  hikes.    Hiraiwa, chairman of the Federation of Economic  Organizations  (Keidanren), told a news conference that the results of this  year's spring labor offensive should be judged from a more  overall perspective. "I doubt the wisdom of picking up only  wages and comparing the sizes of their hikes," he said.    Wage negotiations in such key industries as steel and  electric machinery makers have entered the final stage, with  substantially low wage increases agreed or cited thus far.    Asked about the state of the economy, Hiraiwa said its  recovery will come late this year or early next year.    Although some bright signs have started to appear, including  the pickup in industrial production, housing starts and personal  consumption, there still remain some worrisome factors, such as  the slump in the real estate sector and the yen's appreciation,  he said. "Transactions in commercial properties remain  sluggish, while the worries over a possible spurt of the yen  linger. Corporations are still in the middle of cutting labor  and facilities," he said.    Warning against premature optimism, Hiraiwa also noted the  possibility of a downturn of the economy in the spring. "Last  year, many people predicted the economy bottomed out in March,  but the yen's subsequent rise pulled it down in the April-June  period. We cannot deny the possibility this year, too," he said.</p>

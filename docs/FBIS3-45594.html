Twenty years later, at 40, Tang is general manager of the  only firm in Sichuan's capital, Chengdu, which strives to employ  former "educated youth."    And the firm markets Yunnan's products in Sichuan.    "My life has been closely linked to the red soil in Yunnan  --  first as a worker producing its products and then as its  `salesman'," said Tang, a soft-spoken, heavy set man.    In 1971, at the height of the "Cultural Revolution"  (1966-76)  Sichuan sent 40,000 high school graduates to build Yunnan's  plantations.    The drive was in response to Chairman Mao Zedong's call for  educated youth to work in rural and less developed areas and to  receive re-education from the peasants.    "We felt proud of being chosen to work in Yunnan following  Chairman Mao's call," said Tang. "But we never expected the  hardships we encountered there."    After a day's train ride and four days' walk, Tang and the  other 18 year-olds reached a farm run by the Yunnan Provincial  Wasteland Reclamation Bureau.    The farm was surrounded by rugged mountains and almost  completely cut off from the outside world.    The students felled trees to build shelters and reclaimed  wasteland to plant crops to feed themselves. The rules were  strict: No one was permitted to leave the farm without  permission.    "Because of the harsh living conditions, many of us wept  when  we arrived," Tang recalled. "I was also shocked by the  wilderness, but determined to do all I could." Shortly after he  arrived, Tang was appointed a section director. He quickly  became popular because he was among the hardest workers and was  always ready to help the weak.    Tang rose to become deputy director of the reclamation  bureau  in 1974, taking charge of the branch's planting of coffee shrubs  and rubber trees.    "When cold weather came, we used our coats and quilts to  cover the rubber and coffee trees to save them from damage,"  Tang said.    With the notion that man could triumph over nature, Tang and  his colleagues had no inkling that some of the hilly areas where  they laboured were unsuitable for growing coffee and rubber.    Worse, like most Chinese at the time, they had no conception  of the market and reasonable production costs.    The stuff the "educated youth" produced was often stockpiled  because their costs were too high.    "For example," Tang said, "it cost 8,000 yuan ($1,400) for  us  to make one ton of rubber, while it cost 2,000 yuan ($350) less  to import a ton from Malaysia."    After eight years and the failure of some of their ventures,  the "educated youth" became disillusioned and wanted to return  to Sichuan.    "I also was disillusioned and I quit," Tang said.    He found a job in the Agricultural and Animal Husbandry  Department of Sichuan Province. But he did not like the dull  routine and resigned after four years.    He and three former "educated youth" founded a photo studio.  From there, they set up a firm distributing home decoration  materials.    In 1991 a group of former "educated youth" held a photo  exhibition in Chengdu to mark the 20th anniversary of their  arrival in Yunnan.    Most "educated youth" living in the area attended. Many were  so moved they cried. Some returned daily, hoping to see friends  they once knew.    Encouraged by the people he met at the exhibition, Tang  dissolved his firm and raised 2 million yuan ($351,000) with  some former "educated youth" to launch the shareholding Chengdu  Chuandian Industrial and Trade Corporation in January, 1992.    Chuandian stands for Sichuan and Yunnan.    "By connecting the two provinces, we hope to continue to  contribute to the Yunnan plantations where we devoted the best  years of our lives," Tang explained.    They became more fervent about their goal after a survey by  the United Nations Development Programme declared that coffee  beans grown in Yunnan were better than beans from Colombia,  South America.    They were further encouraged by news that the United Nations  had invested nearly $10 million to help Yunnan import coffee  packaging and production equipment from Europe.    What Tang's former work camp and now Yunnan's largest coffee  producer needed was access to a larger market.    This was where Tang and his colleagues at the Chengdu  Chuandian Industrial and Trade Corporation could help.    For nearly two years, Tang's firm has spent huge sums of  money advertising Yunnan coffee in Sichuan's media. Tang and  his colleagues also have taken advantage of their status as  former "educated youth" and rallied the support of their former  compatriots who now hold important positions in different  sectors in Sichuan.    "Because of their special feelings for Yunnan, many former  'educated youth' are willing to help its coffee find a place in  the Sichuan marketplace," Tang said.    Their efforts have paid off. Yunnan coffee broke into the  market in 1992 and was purchased by 30 large hotels and shopping  centres in Chengdu. Tang's firm alone sold over 40 million yuan  ($6 million) worth of Yunnan coffee.    Last year, most large hotels and shopping centres in Chengdu  and some other cities in Sichuan sold Yunnan coffee. Sales at  Tang's firm alone registered more than 80 million yuan ($14  million).    Tang ascribes much of the success to the firm's employees.    "As former `educated youth,' we work hard and can bear  hardships," Tang said. "And, we co-operate with each other."    Because Tang's firm is the only Chengdu company which  promotes its allegiance with "educated youth," some of them have  applied to the firm for assistance when they've lost jobs or  suffered setbacks in business.    Tang has done his best to help them, said Chen Dawen, an  employee of the firm.    Last year, a Yunnan Province girl wrote Tang's company  saying  she had been born 17 years ago to an "educated youth" who was  forced to abandon her when she returned to Chengdu.    The girl asked Tang to locate her mother.    Tang's firm not only found the girl's mother, now a teacher  at Sichuan University. When it discovered the mother was too  poor to move her daughter to Sichuan Province, it spent 40,000  yuan ($7,000) for relocation expenses.    "The `educated youth' paid a heavy price in the past, Tang  said. "As their former leader, I'm duty-bound to help them  today."</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Text] Belgrade, May 17 (TANJUG) -- The international  conference on the former Yugoslavia, set up in London 21 months  ago, will be extended by another six months. The work on  restoring peace in the former Yugoslav Republic of  Bosnia-Herzegovina would be resumed in Geneva, despite the fact  that the conference was sidelined this spring, REUTERS quotes  diplomatic sources in Geneva as saying.    Relevant international bodies have also agreed on allowing a  budget for the future work of the conference, [words indistinct]  Russian and especially U.S. initiatives for strengthening the  Bosnian peace process, have contributed to the sidelining of the  Geneva conference.    The United States, determined to show the Europeans it had  more efficacious solutions for Bosnia, took over the initiative  in February. Shortly earlier, in January, the European Union  (E.U.) plan collapsed because of the U.S.-sponsored Bosnian  Moslem rejection. Namely, Bosnian Moslem leader Alija  Izetbegovic took a hostile stand towards the plan, relying on  undoubted support by the U.S. Administration. The E.U. peace  plan, the adoption of which was within reach in January, was  thus completely neglected and international mediators Lord Owen  and Thorvald Stoltenberg were nearly eliminated from the talks.    Despite various efforts made in the meantime -- including  direct negotiations between Bosnian Moslems and Croats, who have  signed a federation agreement, and open threats and air strikes  -- peace in Bosnia was more and more distant.    Everything has returned to Geneva where seven ministers of  the "great troika" (the United States, Russia, the E.U.) on  Friday reached accord to resume seeking a political solution  under the E.U. plan, thus taking everything back to where it was  in January. The latest Geneva initiative, which could also be  called "a plan of united action," represents a new proposal  primarily because Washington and Moscow are backing the E.U.  concept.    The latest evidence that everthing is going back to the  Geneva conference, i.e. the E.U. plan, is seen in the current  diplomatic mission of Owen and Stoltenberg, who arrived in  Belgrade on Tuesday to confer with President of the Yugoslav  Republic of Serbia Slobodan Milosevic.    The Yugoslav Government's commission for monitoring the  international conference on the former Yugoslavia on Tuesday  requested that the Yugoslav delegation should be treated on an  equal footing at the conference, especially within the group for  economic issues and the group for succession, which implies that  U.N. sanctions against Yugoslavia (Serbia/Montenegro) should be  lifted.    The insistence on the lifting of the sanctions is even more  justified by the fact that Yugoslavia was requested by Geneva to  submit a report on the application of market economy which is  hard to realize under the sanctions, the Yugoslav Government's  commission said at its session.</p>

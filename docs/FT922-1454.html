			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / France puts officials on trial over use of HIV-infected blood FOUR senior French public health officials went on trial yesterday facing charges of allowing the distribution of blood infected with HIV, as a result of which 256 haemophiliacs have died of Aids during the past seven years, writes William Dawkins in Paris. The trial, expected to produce a judgment in October, was triggered by complaints from haemophiliacs and bereaved parents. It could embarrass the government, since the alleged offences took place in 1985, under the first Socialist administration. Around 1,300 haemophiliacs, including those who died from the mistake, were infected, nearly 45 per cent of all haemophiliacs in France. Mrs Georgina Dufoix, social affairs minister at the time - who has not been charged - has admitted to being 'deeply responsible but not guilty'. This is the biggest recorded disaster in French medical history and has sparked off a complete reorganisation of blood distribution in France. So far, the government and insurance companies have paid FFr200m (Pounds 20.3m) in compensation to victims, but this is only a small fraction of the total expected bill. The allegedly contaminated blood was distributed by the CNTS national blood transfusion centre, which has a monopoly on blood supplies. According to the prosecution, the four men allowed the blood to be distributed, knowing that it was infected and that it could have been made safe by a heat process already in use in the US, Britain and Germany. A government report published last year suggests they were awaiting the development of a rival French process. Two of the defendants, Dr Michel Garretta, former director of the transfusion centre, and Dr Jean-Pierre Allain, head of research and development there, are charged with deception over the qualities of the blood they sold, for which they could be imprisoned for up to four years. The others, Prof Jacques Roux, the government's former director general for health, and Dr Robert Netter, former director of the national health laboratory, are accused of failing to help people in danger, which carries a sentence of up to five years in prison. Mr Garretta has argued on television that he and his colleagues are being made scapegoats and that the government should widen the investigation.</p>

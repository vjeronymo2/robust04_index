			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Marianela Samper from the "Evening Information </F> Review" newscast]    [Text] The Havana City People's Provincial Court sentenced  Rodolfo Gonzalez Gonzalez to seven years in prison for the  offense of spreading enemy propaganda. Gonzalez, age 34, a  member of the outlawed Cuban Human Rights Committee, admitted he  cooperated with counterrevolutionary radio stations based in the  United States. (Edelmira Pedriz) was the prosecutor of case No.  49 of 1993 and now gives us details on the legal substantiation  of the case.    [Begin recording] [Pedriz] The paragraphs of Article 103 of  the Penal Code, through Paragraph 3, describe the offense of  enemy propaganda. To be specific, the charge against Rodolfo  Gonzalez is contained in Paragraph 2 of Article 103. It notes  that a person who spreads false news or ill-intended predictions  for the purpose of causing alarm or public unrest is liable to  receive one to four years in prison. Paragraph 3 mentions a  specific aggravating factor for this offense. It notes that if  the mass media are used in carrying out the actions mentioned in  the above paragraphs the prison term ranges from seven to 15  years. What happened in this case? Everything that was said  -- even the defendant said it during the hearing and the defense  lawyer, who was tasked with representing the interests of  Gonzalez in accordance with what our Constitution and law  dictate, corroborated it.... [pauses] During the trial, the  argument against the charge was that Rodolfo Gonzalez committed  no offense because he did nothing but make use of his sacred  right to express his ideas freely, the right of freedom of  opinion, the freedom to express ideas and beliefs. The  constitutionality of the charge was questioned during the trial  to buttress this argument, although it is totally without legal  or material justification. The argument was that in this case  there was no dissemination of news but of ideas and that the  Cuban state is violating not just what our Constitution but what  the Universal Human Rights Declaration says.    [Samper] I [word indistinct] mention the case and that it  was  proved during the trial that Gonzalez used to contact U.S.-based  radio stations to give false reports on disturbances and human  rights violations in Cuba, things that never happened. In  addition, it was also proved that everything was distorted.  Would you like to explain briefly to us this aspect?    [Pedriz] This case involves a dissemination of neither ideas  nor opinions because, according to the file, on a nearly daily  basis between March and May 1992, Rodolfo Gonzalez had contacts,  with the frequency I just noted, with Mr. (Alvaro de Insua), a  journalist residing in Miami, through calls from the United  States to a specific location in Cuba that could never be  determined. [end recording]    According to the charges, citizen Rodolfo Gonzalez spread  false information [accusaciones] on the country's situation and  on actions by domestic law-and-order groups [cuerpos del orden  interior] that violate citizens' rights to create unrest and to  incite the population to carry out acts of civil disobedience  against island authorities.    Other charges refuted by the Public Prosecutor's Office  pertain to the health status of counterrevolutionaries Sebastian  Arcos, who is currently in prison, and Maria Elena Cruz Varela,  who is currently free. Pedriz commented on the international  repercussions of the dissemination of this false information:    [Begin Pedriz recording] If you recall the trial, which  received ample coverage, the accused insisted that all the news  and all the information on alleged human rights violations in  Cuba make their way to the headquarters of the Human Rights  Commission in Geneva, and, of course, given the effect of this  on our country's security abroad, the Socialist state is under  attack. The integrity and the stability of the entire Cuban  social order is being attacked with this activity that is  adorned with a peaceful and humanitarian touch. This is not so,  because it does not have a trace of humanitarianism. Actually,  it was antipatriotic, and this was demonstrated at the trial.  [end recording]    The trial, which was held on 29 March, complied with all  guarantees specified in procedural rules that are currently in  force in the country. In keeping with Article 59 of the  Constitution of the Republic of Cuba, this trial involved a  competent court by virtue of laws that were in force prior to  the perpetration of the crime and conformed to the formalties it  established. Lawyer (Juan Escandel Ramirez) defended the  accused, Rodolfo Gonzalez Gonzalez. The defense may appeal, in  keeping with Article 67, Paragraph 1, of the Penal Procedure  Law, before the Havana City People's Provincial Court within  five days of the ruling.</p>

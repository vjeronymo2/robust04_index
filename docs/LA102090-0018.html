			<p><P> October 20, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A SPECIAL MEMORY OF MAZEROSKI HOMER  </P> <P> I remember where I was on Oct. 13, 1960, at 3:36 in the afternoon. I was in my  mother's womb exactly six days to the minute from the day I was born.  </P> <P> This may seem to be an astonishing accomplishment, except that my memories of  Bill Mazeroski's home run began 10 years later at the beginning of my baseball  "career." I was unsure about my skill and about my body due to injuries I  suffered at the age of 4.  </P> <P> So when I ran onto the field to begin my tryout, I had only one ally, my father  and his memories of that 1960 World Series. He would describe how the New York  Yankees were heavily favored to win against the Pirates and how these same  Pirates went on to win the world championship.  </P> <P> I made the team that year and every year after and every time I read about the  home run or see it on TV, I get a chill about my dad reliving it for me back in  the summer of 1970.  </P> <P> LARRY GOBLE  </P> <P> Long Beach  </P></p>

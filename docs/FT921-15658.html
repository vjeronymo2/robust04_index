			<p>920109 FT  09 JAN 92 / Accountants urge institute change CHARTERED ACCOUNTANTS are pressuring their main professional body to change fundamentally by halving itself. A group of members of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales is calling for a separate body to represent members' interests, alongside the institute's role of upholding professional standards. A detailed paper has been circulated to district societies and members of the institute's council, its ruling body. The council's annual conference begins today in Birmingham. It argues that the institute cannot fulfil both functions and urges it to establish a new organisation with salaried directors to offer commercial services such as indemnity insurance, and to lobby on behalf of the profession. The charter of the institute, the paper says, restricts its activities to advancing the profession rather than the interests of its members. These do not coincide and raise questions of a conflict of interest.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 29 Mar (PL) -- Pedro Ross Leal, secretary  general of the Cuban Workers Federation (CTC), has cited the  proposals by the workers movement to heal the country's  finances, saying a change in mentality is needed to find  solutions.    He has said the more than 80,000 meetings at work centers,  attended by more than 3 million people, undoubtedly had had a  positive outcome. The objective of the meetings, which started  in late January, was to consult with the rank and file on  solutions to the economic problems.    The labor movement's biggest accomplishment has been in  promoting a change in mentality, even in its own union groups,  the CTC leader has told the newspaper GRANMA.    After saying the assembly process, popularly known as  workers  parliaments, had yielded high political gains, Ross said the  main demands had centered on greater control of material and  financial resources and the implementation of penalties on those  who steal government assets.    The workers explicitly understand a revamping of the  country's finances requires an increase of production based on  improved productivity and efficiency, he has said.    Ever since Cuba lost its commercial partners in the former  socialist bloc, it has been confronting an adverse economic  situation that can be translated into an excess of currency  greater than $10 billion--equivalent to dollars in the official  exchange--a fiscal deficit of 4.2 billion [no currency  specified] and high subsidies. [sentence as received]    Furthermore, the U.S. blockade, in effect for more than 30  years, was intensified, causing losses calculated at more than  $40 billion, according to local authorities' conservative  estimates.    The Cuban Parliament agreed last December to hold a special  meeting to discuss the restoration of the country's internal  finances. The date of the meeting has still not been announced  officially, but media sources estimate it will be in April.</p>

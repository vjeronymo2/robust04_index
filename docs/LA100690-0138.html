			<p><P> October 6, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> D.A. REVIEWS PLANNER'S POTENTIAL CONFLICTS;  </P> <P> ORANGE: TWO COMPANIES OWNED IN PART BY DON GREEK WERE AWARDED AT LEAST $104,000  IN CONTRACTS WHILE HE WAS A PLANNING COMMISSIONER, INVESTIGATORS FIND.  </P> <P> While Don Greek was a city planning commissioner, two companies he owns in part  were awarded at least $104,000 worth of city projects, a potential conflict of  interest now being reviewed by the district attorney's office, according to  documents released Friday.  </P> <P> Greek, who resigned from the Planning Commission in August to run for City  Council in the Nov. 6 election, was warned in a 1986 letter from then-City  Atty. Gene R. Minshew that the payments could be considered improper under a  state conflict-of-interest code.  </P> <P> "You and I have talked twice about this matter," Minshew wrote. "I have a  feeling that you may not be giving the matter the attention it deserves."  </P> <P> Greek said Friday that he does not remember receiving the letter or discussing  the matter with Minshew.  </P> <P> "If I had received it, I probably would have reacted to it, but I don't have  any recollection of reacting to it, and I don't have any recollection of the  letter. I honestly can't remember it," said Greek, who was a commissioner from  1983 until August.  </P> <P> Documentation of eight engineering projects awarded to DGA Consultants Inc. and  Don Greek &amp; Associates from 1986 to June and Minshew's letter were released  Friday by Corrado &amp; Newton, a law firm hired by the City Council to look  into city contracting procedures.  </P> <P> The documents were copies of those turned over to the district attorney's  office. Robert Corrado, special counsel to the City Council, released the  documents after the district attorney's review became public earlier this week.  </P> <P> The documents include copies of invoices from DGA Consultants Inc. and Don  Greek &amp; Associates and checks from the city totaling more than $104,000.  The largest of the projects was a $44,000 contract to analyze street alignments  and improvements for a joint Orange-Santa Ana project. The average contract  amount was $4,013.  </P> <P> Projects of less than $10,000 are generally awarded by city staff members  without City Council approval, said Bert Yamasaki, Orange's administrator of  economic development; contracts worth more than that must be bid and require a  City Council vote.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. John D. Conley is reviewing the situation after a  conflict-of-interest complaint was filed Monday by local political activist  Shirley Grindle.  </P> <P> In the 1986 letter to Greek, Minshew details a case in San Diego where an  appeals court ruled that it was a conflict of interest under the City Charter  and state law for a parks and recreation board member to have his business  enter into contracts with the city.  </P> <P> Because the City Council and not the Planning Commission has final approval of  contracts, Minshew added, "it does not appear to me that there is a conflict of  interest in your situation."  </P> <P> However, Minshew said, Greek should be "concerned" about the San Diego court  decision and should consult his attorney "to be sure that there will be no  violation of Government Code Section 1090."  </P> <P> That section says state, county and city employees and officers "shall not be  financially interested in any contract made by them in their official capacity  or by any body or board of which they are members."  </P> <P> Greek said Friday that he believes that the investigation was instigated by  Councilwoman Joanne Coontz, a foe in the City Council election.  </P> <P> "I know I haven't done anything wrong," Greek said, "and I also know it's a  misuse of city funds to use them to discourage me from running for office."  </P> <P> Coontz replied that the Greek inquiry emerged from an overall review of the  city's contracting procedures and was not directed at him.  </P> <P> "In the process of learning about contracts, we ran across this and asked, was  this legal for a person who was on the Planning Commission," Coontz said.  "That's all it was, just everyday procedure."  </P></p>

This was announced over the weekend in Beijing by Cheng  Kejie, chairman of the regional government.    In June, Cheng is to visit Singapore to negotiate the  specific terms of the deal.    "We expect a bundle of large projects financed by Singapore  to be finalized soon in the Tieshangang area," Cheng told a  press conference held during the ongoing National People's  Congress.    Guangxi, the potential trade thoroughfare between China and  Southeast Asia, is the latest investment target of Singapore,  which is moving a large chunk of its business to China.    Singapore has already agreed to set up tens of billions of  dollars worth of industrial projects in Suzhou, Jiangsu Province.    Guangxi, however, is closer to Southeast Asia. It has 1,595  kilometres of coastline capable of supporting 21 ports.    Many believe foreign investors would find it an easy  springboard to enter the country's vast West.    Hong Puzhou, head of Guangxi's Planning Commission, said the  region is expected to set up one of the nation's few electronics  and automobile manufacturing bases within the next couple of  years.    And Beihai, a port city on the Beibu Gulf, has gained State  support to become an international economic hub.    Economists have predicted that Beihai will be part of an  emerging international economic centre formed by Vietnam and  China.    To date, most foreign investment in Guangxi has gone into  Beihai.    Cheng also said that Guangxi will build or renovate five  major airports capable of handling Boeing 747 planes in three  years.    And it should have an additional installed capacity of 4  million kilowatts next year when five power plants come on  stream.    Cheng added that the State plans to set up a 4.2 million  kilowatt hydropower plant in Guangxi soon. Despite Guangxi's  plans, poverty remains the biggest problem.</p>

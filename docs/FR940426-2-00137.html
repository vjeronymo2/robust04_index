			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> V. FTA's Final Action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In keeping with congressional intent that FTA carefully respect the prerogatives of local decisionmakers with regard to the participation of private enterprise in the provision of mass transit, FTA is rescinding its 1984 Policy Statement (49 FR 41310, October 22, 1984), Circular 7005.1, Chapter X of Circular 9040.1C, and Chapter IV of Circular 9070.1C. The recision of this guidance will become effective thirty days after publication of this notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FTA's recision of the current guidance is based on its judgment that the requirements it imposes, while ineffective, have unduly infringed on the decisionmaking authority that local officials are entitled to exercise under the FT Act. FTA believes that this recision is within the broad limits of its authority under the FT Act, that it is, in fact, ``an administrative decision which is essentially an exercise of discretion.''  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> South Suburban <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  at 539. FTA's action in this matter represents a policy choice, one it believes to be reasonable and valid in light of its review of the agency's experience in administering the current provisions over the past ten years and fully within the limits of its policymaking discretion. The Supreme Court has affirmed the authority of an agency to make policy choices within the scope of its statutory delegation.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Chevron <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  at 865&hyph;866.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In rescinding these requirements, we emphasize that the agency continues to support the participation of private enterprise; indeed, we believe that the applicable requirements_the section 9(f) process and the new section 8 planning requirements_represent a comprehensive and thorough approach to the consideration of private enterprise at the local level, consistent with requirements of the FT Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We first stress the continuing significance of the section 9(f) process as described in FTA Circular 9030.1A, during which key decisions regarding private enterprise participation are made. Pursuant to chapter IV of that Circular, each recipient:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Makes available to the public information concerning the amount of funds available under section 9 and the program of projects that the recipient proposes to undertake with such funds;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Develops a proposed program of projects concerning activities to be funded in consultation with interested parties, including private transportation providers;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Publishes the proposed program of projects in sufficient detail and in such a manner as to afford affected citizens, private transportation providers, and as appropriate, local elected officials an opportunity to examine its content and to submit comments on the proposed program of projects and budget and on the performance of the recipient; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Affords an opportunity for a public hearing to obtain the views of citizens on the proposed program of projects.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Circular further provides that in preparing the final program of projects to be submitted to the FTA, the recipient consider the views and comments of private transportation providers and, if appropriate, modify the proposed program of projects and budget.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The second leg of the agency's implementation of the private enterprise provisions involves the planning regulations recently issued jointly by FTA and the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). Sections 1024, 1025, and 3012 of ISTEA amended the FT Act by revising section 8 to require a continuing, comprehensive, and coordinated transportation planning process in metropolitan areas and States. ISTEA makes fundamental changes to the traditional planning and programming criteria for project selection in metropolitan areas. There is heightened emphasis on environmental and intermodal values, financial constraint in plans and transportation improvement programs (TIPs), and greater public participation in local decisionmaking. Moreover, the rules are designed to facilitate State and local compliance with the Clean Air Act conformity requirements for nonattainment areas through the development and adoption of the plans and TIPs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, the statewide planning regulation requires that States consider all modes of transportation_surface, air, water_in developing plans and programs that can serve all areas of a State efficiently and effectively. Implementing ISTEA, the rule calls for public participation in statewide planning and programming and for State agencies to more closely coordinate their efforts with all other interested parties, public and private.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Thus, with FHWA, FTA has amended the metropolitan planning regulations at 23 CFR part 450 and has issued new statewide planning regulations to carry out the directives of ISTEA. These rules apply to all MPOs serving urbanized areas with a population of at least 50,000, State transportation agencies, and publicly operated transit agencies. The rules provide for the development of transportation plans and TIPs and for the selection of projects to be funded under title 23 U.S.C. and the FT Act in metropolitan areas and States. Because of the significance of these new rules, FTA and FHWA are undertaking a comprehensive outreach effort to explain the new requirements to States, metropolitan planning organizations, transit operators, and private entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sections 450.316(b) and 450.212 of the metropolitan planning rule set out detailed and extensive requirements regarding public participation in the development of transportation plans by statewide agencies and MPOs. These provisions require that private operators be provided with timely information about transportation issues and an opportunity to comment throughout the transportation planning process. They also require that interested parties be provided with access to technical and policy information used in the development of plans and TIPs, as well as open public meetings where matters related to transit programs are being considered.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In short, under this framework the private enterprise provisions now involve a dual effort: first, at the local transit system level by means of the section 9(f) consultative process discussed above, and second, at the expanded metropolitan planning level, which through the ISTEA and its implementing regulations has become the critical point where transportation decisions will be made.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FTA believes that the section 9(f) and section 8 requirements will provide an adequate basis for the finding required under section 3(e) before FTA may provide financial assistance to a public body for the operation of service that competes with or supplements service provided by an existing mass transportation company, i.e., that the program of projects required to be developed by MPOs by section 8 provides for the participation of private enterprise to the maximum extent feasible.&hyph;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FTA's findings will be based on such criteria as the efforts a grantee or MPO has made to notify and consult with the private sector in its section 8 or section 9(f) planning process; the effect of public mass transit service proposals on existing private mass transit operators; and any other steps or processes the grantee or MPO has taken to encourage private sector involvement. FTA believes that such factors will allow it to determine whether the program developed under section 8 involves the private sector ``to the maximum extent feasible,'' given particular local circumstances, both in connection with grant making sections 3, 9 and 18. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sections 450.316(b) and 450.212 provide that before submitting a proposed program of projects to FTA for certification, a State or MPO must assure that citizens, affected public agencies, representatives of transportation agency employees, private providers of transportation and other interested parties have been given full and open access to the decisionmaking process. In ISTEA Congress signaled its intent that FTA should defer to the local decisionmaking process with regard to the participation of private enterprise by adding the following to section 8(i)(5): <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary shall not withhold certification under this section based upon the policies and criteria established by a metropolitan planning organization or transit grant recipient for determining the feasibility of private enterprise participation in accordance with section 8(o) of the Federal Transit Act. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, in making a finding under section 3(e) when making a specific grant, FTA will rely on its previous certification of the transportation planning process developed under section 8, unless it has noted deficiencies in that process related to private enterprise participation. In addition, FTA will conduct periodic Federal planning management reviews to ensure that all the planning requirements of section 8 are being met by recipients of FTA funds. Furthermore, FTA will monitor compliance with the private enterprise provisions of the FT Act as part of the annual audits and triennial reviews mandated by section 9. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Dated: April 21, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Gordon J.

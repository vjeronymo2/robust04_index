The  local soil is pregranulated and dried in reactors equipped with  electric arc plasmotrons. Optimal granule size must be  determined, as well as the thermal processing parameters.  High-temperature processing of granules in gas streams generated  by electric arc plasmotrons involves complex radiative and  convective heat exchange. This paper attempts to consider  radiative and convective heat exchange in the heating of  spherical soil particles in a stream of low-temperature plasma.  The temperature distribution over the radius of the spherical  particle is determined from the beginning of thermal processing.  The temperature dependence of the thermal conductivity of the  soil was determined experimentally in the 20-1200C range  and can be tracked for a specific initial temperature of the  sphere and gas medium temperature. It was found that for a wide  range of radii the movement of the thermal pulse from the  surface to the center of the particles occurs at an  approximately uniform speed. Radiative heat exchange plays a  significant role in radiative-convective heating of the  particles. Other aspects of thermal processing are examined.  Further research is needed to determine optimal parameters.  Figures 2; references 6: 5 Russian, 1 Western.</p>

			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (3): A fillip for share options The chancellor used the Budget to promote the long-held Conservative philosophy that individuals should own shares, both in their own companies and directly in other groups. Company share-option schemes have too frequently been used as 'shares for the boys', with only a few key executives being allowed to reap the rewards of corporate success. The Chancellor has tried to encourage the widening of such schemes by allowing options to be offered at a 15 per cent discount, provided that a wider scheme has been publicised to all eligible employees over the previous 12 months. It is not clear how 'publicised' will be defined, and whether a dog-eared announcement on a dark corner of a board next to the Health and Safety at Work Act notice will qualify. The potential size of share scheme rewards has also been increased. The ceiling for participation in a SAYE share-option scheme has been increased from Pounds 150 to Pounds 250 a month. And the maximum annual benefit under a profit-sharing scheme has been raised from Pounds 6,000 to Pounds 8,000, subject to an over-riding limit of 10 per cent of salary. Beneficiaries can also save on capital gains tax, because they can invest Pounds 3,000 of their shares into a personal equity plan (Pep) without facing an immediate capital gains tax bill. This change was linked to a decision to allow all investors to set up a Pounds 3,000 'single company' Pep, in addition to the normal Pounds 6,000 PEP allowance. This was another affirmation of the government's belief that Peps should encourage direct ownership in shares, despite all the evidence that private shareholders face severe risks unless they build a large, diversified portfolio. Investment and unit trusts were kept at the Pounds 3,000 limit for a Pep, although they will gain from the ruling that European stocks will qualify for Pep inclusion. Previously, 50 per cent of an investor's holdings needed to be in the UK; now the 50 cent rule applies to the EC. The change will take effect in the autumn.</p>

			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / International Company News: Cautious nod for News Corp stock The Australian Stock Exchange's indexation department yesterday gave only a qualified nod to the new preferred limited voting ordinary shares which Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation plans to issue this month. It said it would include the shares in the calculation of Australia's All-Ordinaries index, the stock market's main marker, for at least three months, but review the situation after that initial period. If the new shares were well-traded and performed in line with the existing ordinary shares, they would remain in the index. If they traded in significantly different fashion, however, they would be removed. The shares are being issued by way of a one-for-two scrip issue, and it is expected that trading will start on Thursday. News Corp's decision to issue the limited voting shares has been the focus of much attention because of Mr Murdoch's apparent desire to raise new capital without diluting his family's control of the company any further. If investors can be persuaded that the limited voting shares are roughly equivalent to the existing ordinary shares, News Corp would be able issue more of this class of stock without undermining the Murdoch voting position  -except in a very limited range of circumstances. Last month, in a move designed to appeal to investors, News Corp announced that it would amend its articles at a future extraordinary meeting, so that the limited voting shares are promised a dividend premium of not less than 20 per cent over the dividend on the ordinary shares, and are ensured similar treatment as the ordinary shares in the event of a bid for News Corp. Nevertheless, some sceptics still believe that the limited voting shares will trade at a discount to the existing ordinary stock.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Stephen Bates article: "Major Supports Call for ID Cards"] </F>   [Text] The Prime Minister appeared to give his support  yesterday to the introduction of identity cards for all  citizens.    He told MPs during question time there was a strong case for  identity cards despite practical difficulties, and said they  were being considered.    The Government has previously always concluded that the  practical difficulties and cost of issuing accurate and  up-to-date identity cards made it impractical, though they are  popular with the otherwise libertarian right as a means of  tracking criminals and preventing social security fraud.    Any attempt to introduce identity cards would cause  political  controversy and opposition on civil liberties grounds.    The issue was raised by the right-wing backbench MP Nicholas  Budgen (Wolverhampton SW) in the wake of police swoops on 60  alleged illegal immigrants from Africa working for  Labour-controlled Southwark council.    Mr Major said: "I think there is a strong case to be made  for  identity cards. There are undoubtedly great practical  difficulties in introducing them, and there are other matters to  be considered as well, but we have been looking at the options  in this respect and we propose to go on doing so."</p>

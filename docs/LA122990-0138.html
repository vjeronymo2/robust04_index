			<p><P> December 29, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOVIET CHURCHES UNSURE OF COURSE AS NATION STRUGGLES FOR FREEDOM;  </P> <P> EASTERN EUROPE: THE PEOPLE ARE EAGER FOR SOMETHING TO BELIEVE IN, BUT THERE IS  NO PRECEDENT FOR HOW RELIGIOUS INSTITUTIONS SHOULD ACT AND THINK IN THIS  ENVIRONMENT.  </P> <P> The beefy young security guard, dressed in the standard Soviet military uniform  of gray with red trim, stopped us at the entrance to the imposing Supreme  Soviet building overlooking the Moscow River. We were there, I told him, to  keep an appointment with Father Vyacheslav Polosin, chairman of the Supreme  Soviet Committee on Freedom of Conscience, Religion, Philanthropy and Charity.  Could he help us find him?  </P> <P> The guard didn't know whether Polosin's office was there, or if the Russian  Orthodox priest was in or out. He scowled and yelled officiously into two gray  telephones on his desk -- neither had dials -- yet all the while he appeared  genuinely concerned to make contact for my interview.  </P> <P> After 10 minutes of alternately shouting, smiling, pacing and banging telephone  receivers, the guard succeeded in piercing a typical maze of Soviet  inefficiency and we were escorted into the sixth-floor office of the bearded,  robed priest. There, we talked for more than an hour about the sweeping new  religious liberty law that he had helped draft.  </P> <P> This incident, falling on the final day of an intensive, three-week trip  through the Soviet Union -- from the Baltic to the Black Sea and the Ukraine to  the Kremlin -- struck me as an apt parable of a huge country in rapid and  irreversible change.  </P> <P> The blustery old-line authority is wavering while the new guard is trying to  figure out who or what will replace it. At the same time that leaders are  adjusting to glasnost and perestroika, inefficiency, scarce resources and a  lack of motivation are crippling the country's efforts to stave off political  chaos and economic collapse.  </P> <P> And Soviet religion is caught in the middle in this new era of unprecedented  freedom and opportunity, vulnerability and peril. There is simply no precedent  for how the church should live and think in this environment.  </P> <P> I found a certain naivete as well: 70 years of repression have left many  Soviets with the belief that religious values, if only allowed to flourish,  could now quickly instill moral leadership and install charitable services that  communism has so dismally failed to provide.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, unsophisticated church leaders, with only rudimentary theology and a  paucity of sound religious literature, are easy targets in a supermarket of  spiritual beliefs and self-anointed messiahs now abroad in this vast land.  </P> <P> As a first-time visitor to the Soviet Union, I shared what I suspect are the  assumptions and preconceptions of many Americans.  </P> <P> I knew that Russia is only one member, although the most populous one, of the  still-intact 15-republic Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, which stretches  across 11 time zones and occupies one-seventh of the world's land mass. But I  gained a firsthand appreciation of the country's immense size when our group  spent long days and weary nights just to travel around the western fifth of it.  </P> <P> I had read that this ancient culture, stemming from Babylonian times, consists  of 130 cultural groups, 91 "major" languages and four alphabets. But I felt the  fierceness of the ethnic and regional rivalries when Estonian Christians said  they were insulted by being greeted in Russian, and pastors in the Ukraine  insisted that they needed more Bibles -- but only in the Ukrainian language.  </P> <P> I had been aware that shortages and long lines forced Soviet citizens to wait  for food and household items. But the burden of the scarcity and poor quality  became real to me when I talked to a woman in Tallinn, Estonia, who had been  standing in line for three days waiting unsuccessfully for a basic sewing  machine she had ordered months earlier. In a nearby bakery, people waited in  longer and longer lines for fewer and fewer selections. The large picture of  V.I. Lenin looking down from behind the empty shelves was "mocking the  shoppers," our guide suggested.  </P> <P> I had been prepared to expect corruption, but it was a surprise when an  Aeroflot Airlines ticket agent brazenly told us that she could only get our  translator aboard the crowded flight from Krasnodar to Moscow if we provided  her boss with a carton of American cigarettes. And I wondered how the drivers  stoically waiting in a long queue behind a "no petrol" sign must have felt when  our Russian driver, armed with our U.S. dollars, zoomed ahead for a fill-up at  the supposedly empty gas pump.  </P> <P> I vividly remember the horror I felt in April, 1986, when I learned about the  Chernobyl nuclear accident and the lethal radiation it spread. But I was taken  aback to hear people from the affected area emotionally plead for medical help  now, saying that the full extent of the damage has never been measured and that  the government has done little for victims. I agonized with a pastor who feels  he should remain there to minister, although three of his eight children are  suffering radiation sickness while his wife has begged him to move away.  </P> <P> I had written about the exodus of Soviet Jews seeking to emigrate to Israel,  with 150,000 expected this year and up to 1 million in 1991. But I was shocked  to hear firsthand about rising anti-Semitism in Leningrad at the same time that  Jews have been able to establish new synagogues and open their first legal  yeshiva.  </P> <P> And I saw the ambivalence on the faces of a Baptist family and their friends in  Maikop, near the Black Sea, at a farewell party the day before the family left  for Sacramento. They had waited a year for emigration papers. Some who would  also like to go conveyed more than a twinge of envy. The pastor showed the  church's sorrow in losing its seventh member-family to the West, and the older  generation expressed resignation that "there is little left for them here."  </P> <P> Like most Americans, I had watched the U.S. evening news detail the unraveling  Soviet economy during the waning weeks of summer. I had read that "without a  major revolution, the Soviet Union is spinning apart" and analysts' predictions  that several republics will secede from the Soviet Union within two years.  </P> <P> But I was not expecting the mayor in the Ukrainian city of Rovno to tell us  frankly and openly that "the economic system is totally dissolving and the base  is totally gone... a system doomed to die." Yet, continued Ivan Josipovich, who  had held his elected office as a non-communist a scant five months, "government  structures are still in place. The old guard doesn't want to change a thing.  They are still keeping the power in their hands and the heat on us."  </P> <P> Somehow, life goes on in the faltering republics in spite of terrible  mismanagement, violence and cruelty. Most residents continue to live with  remarkable patience and passivity. None that I talked to believes that  religious freedom or perestroika can be turned back now. But many think that  civil war, or at least severe civil disruption, is virtually inevitable.  </P> <P> In some ways, Marxism was a sincere attempt to right the injustices of a  society in which the privileged and powerful plundered the masses. But because  it is atheistic and subject to the same abuses is sought to correct, in my  opinion it was bound to fail.  </P> <P> Now the fallout of new religious freedom has exposed the pent-up yearning for  spirituality in the hearts of most of the Soviet people. They seem starved for  morality, for integrity, for trustworthiness.  </P> <P> "A lot of people are believing now," said Vladimir, 17, a Russian Orthodox  altar boy at a church whose members five years ago made a human chain around  the building to keep state authorities from tearing it down.  </P> <P> "It's a remarkable time for the Gospel," said Johannes Reimer, a Russian  "parachurch" pioneer and a leader at the first Soviet congress on  evangelization, attended by 1,000 church leaders in Moscow Oct. 22-26. "There  is a Russian spiritual soul that communism couldn't control. Communists don't  believe in God, yet they sing an old Russian Orthodox song and they cry."  </P> <P> Can the current religious fervor empower a longing to recover a rich spiritual  heritage that was abruptly truncated 70 years ago? And can Nobel Prize-winning  Mikhail S. Gorbachev, whose popularity is fast sinking in his fatherland, turn  around a sprawling country racked by competing nationalistic tendencies and a  technology that seems mostly time-frozen in the 1950s?  </P> <P> Viktor Reimer, Johannes' brother and a co-founder of the Soviet Union, tempered  his hope for a religious new day with the kind of bedrock realism, so prevalent  here, which says that it all boils down to simple economics. "It's the length  of the sausage," he said, "whether people have enough to eat."  </P></p>

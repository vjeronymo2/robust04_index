			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition to the problems it sees with the EPA auction, Clean Air maintains that commercial bulletin board services are also unreliable sources for allowance price information. It argues that bulletin board bid/ask prices may not reflect actual allowance transactions and could subject market participants to inaccurate price signals, gaming and manipulation. Clean Air opposes allowing the selling utility to cost emissions allowances at a market index of its own choosing because this presents the danger of the selling utility picking a price based on the highest-cost index, with no demonstration that this price reflects the realities of the market. Clean Air also opposes the selection of a single index by the Commission, stating that the Commission would risk sending misleading price signals. Clean Air suggests that, in addition to requiring sellers of allowances to inform buyers of the price of allowances and the number of allowances to be provided, the seller should notify the buyer that there is a third party who will provide the allowances at a stated price. Clean Air also proposes that the Commission require sellers to report the volume of allowances transferred, their price and the name of any third parties supplying the allowances. Clean Air states that this Commission should publish these reports to provide buyers with greater market information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Consumers' Counsel and Tellus state that this Commission should expand the scope of this proceeding to include the ratemaking treatment of allowances for all wholesale transactions. The Consumers' Counsel also states that it would be more efficient for a policy statement to recognize other valuation methods in addition to incremental costs, such as a cost-of-compliance approach, and to specify when that method would be more appropriate. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 26 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Additionally, the Consumers' Counsel suggests that the Commission should establish a single monthly market price for allowances and should develop a standard method of allocation of EPA-granted allowances between wholesale and retail customers and between affiliates.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 26 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The suggested cost of compliance approach would value emissions allowances at the cost the seller would incur to reduce emissions rather than using the allowance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Wisconsin Electric argues that EEI's pricing policy is contrary to the CAAA because it will cause generation to shift from Phase I units to non-Phase I units. This is because a requirement that utilities charge the full incremental cost of allowances will result in an increase in the operating cost of Phase I units and result in those units being underutilized. It is possible, Wisconsin Electric argues, that if a Phase I unit is not utilized at ``baseline'' (1985&hyph;1987) levels, the utility may be required by the CAAA to forfeit allowances. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 27 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  For these reasons, Wisconsin Electric suggests, the Commission, in its Policy Statement, should allow utilities with Phase I units the flexibility to charge ``up to'' the incremental cost of a Phase I allowance. Wisconsin Electric argues that achieving least cost dispatch, in light of complexities such as reduced utilization of Phase I units, may require use of a dispatch emissions value that differs from incremental cost.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 27 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> According to Wisconsin Electric, it cannot be assumed that an allowance on a Phase I unit that is underutilized (thereby subjecting the allowance to possible surrender under the CAAA) has an opportunity cost equal to incremental costs since an allowance that is surrendered may not be consumed or traded by the utility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Florida Power seeks to ensure that the Policy Statement not predetermine the issues raised in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Southern Company Services, Inc.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Docket No. ER95&hyph;59&hyph;000, now pending before this Commission. Florida Power also seeks clarification that only Phase I utilities need to file the details of their emission allowance recovery method within 45 days, because it would be premature for Phase II utilities to make such filings now.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> APPA argues that the proposed policy statement would grant excessive discretion to utilities and would open the door to inconsistent ratemaking treatment. APPA complains that EEI's proposal contains no clear requirement that the selling utility be consistent in its ratemaking treatment on simultaneous transactions and does not require a utility to adhere to any particular methodology once adopted. Further, APPA argues, EEI's petition does not define how the revenues from emissions allowances included in rates will be credited to various customer classes. Moreover, APPA argues, EEI's proposal that this Commission allow utilities with existing incremental cost rate provisions to file emission allowance pricing information without revising their rate schedules will authorize utilities to redefine contract terms unilaterally. APPA contends that EEI's proposal does not clearly define the scope of transactions to which the Policy Statement will apply. APPA maintains that the Commission should afford affected parties the opportunity to challenge application of whatever policy is adopted in this Policy Statement on a case-by-case basis. APPA also believes that this Commission should establish a standard market price for allowances or provide a forum for review to ensure the justness and reasonableness of indices or methodologies to be used by a selling utility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Tellus also states that since several utilities recently have filed differing proposals for emissions allowance cost recovery in affiliated transactions, this Commission must act promptly to establish generic ratemaking policies for each type of wholesale arrangement. Tellus further urges the Commission, either in this or in a separate proceeding, to address the ratemaking treatment of costs of compliance with the CAAA, in addition to allowance costs. Tellus suggests that this Commission establish its own monthly market index price for emissions allowances, determine how the profits should be credited to and among wholesale and retail customers, develop a standard method for allocating allowances obtained from EPA at no cost between wholesale and retail customers, and establish generic policies regarding the adequacy and appropriateness of current wholesale rate designs for passing CAAA costs through to wholesale customers. Tellus suggests that average inventory costs might be a valid basis for determining the cost of emissions allowances.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EEI, in reply, again urges issuance of a policy statement by January 1, 1995. EEI argues that the policy guidance requested is appropriately limited to coordination transactions. EEI argues that coordination transactions are a distinct category of voluntary transactions and that the treatment it proposes is consistent with Commission precedent for other out-of-pocket costs incurred in such transactions. EEI submits that the guidance it requests here, while appropriate for coordination transactions, cannot accommodate the varying circumstances and cost allocation issues involved in wholesale requirements service or transactions among affiliated companies. EEI also notes, in reply, that the Commission, in Regulation of Electricity Sales for Resale and Transmission Service, Notice of Inquiry, IV FERC Stats. and Regs. &para;35,518 at 35,628 (1985), order terminating docket, 61 FERC &para;61,371 (1992), defined the term ``coordination transactions,'' and distinguished coordination transactions from requirements transactions. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 28 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 28 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission therein defined coordination transactions as ``sales or exchanges of specialized electricity services that allow buyers to realize cost savings or reliability gains that are not attainable if they rely solely on their own resources. For sellers, these transactions provide opportunities to earn additional revenue, and to lower customer rates, from capacity that is temporarily in excess to native load capacity requirements. Transactions are voluntary and the seller's obligation is limited.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Requirements service was defined as ``a long-term supply of firm power to meet all or part of the buyer's load requirements, including load-growth. Sellers undertake a relatively open-ended commitment to provide service. Utilities must plan and build generation and transmission capacity to meet this commitment. From the seller's perspective, requirements service is essentially the same as retail service with the primary difference being that delivery is typically made at transmission voltages. Requirements customers are considered part of the seller's native load. Buyers are typically municipally or cooperatively owned distributors that resell the power to end-use customers.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> IV FERC Stats. and Regs. at 35,628 (footnote omitted).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission believes that the definition of coordination transactions employed in the Notice of Inquiry will generally be acceptable. Objections that a transaction is not a coordination transaction can be pursued on a case-by-case basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: FT-SE 100 Index reaches new peaks NEW PEAKS on the FT-SE 100 Share Index yesterday signalled another successful trading session in London as global fund managers continued to buy equities across the range of European bourses. Early gains in London were halved when profit-takers appeared both in equities and stock index futures, but a strong opening on Wall Street helped the Footsie to close at 3,100.8, a gain of 15.6 on the day, and just 0.2 above the previous closing high. The market capitalisation of the Footsie-listed stocks moved above Pounds 500bn for the first time. News that domestic car sales gained more than 11 per cent last month provided a curtain-raiser for today's speech by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor of the exchequer, to the annual conference of Britain's Conservative party. Firmness in Far Eastern stock markets overnight provided fresh support for the opening of the London market, and an early gain of 5.1 on the Footsie was quickly extended when the December contract on the Index came in once again at a strong premium. Stock market traders spent the rest of the session watching the play between the Footsie and the futures contract. By mid-morning, the FT-SE Index was 31.1 ahead at 3,116.3, a new intra-day trading peak. At this stage, the Footsie was 77 points, or about 2.5 per cent, up since last Friday. Hardly surprisingly, the pace proved too hot to maintain and the premium on the futures contract diminished and profits were taken in the underlying blue chip stocks. Trading volume was not excessive and the Footsie dropped back below the 3,100 market as Wall Street made an initially uncertain start to the new session. But equities resumed the upward path after Wall Street turned strongly higher, showing a gain of 16 points on the Dow Industrial Average during UK trading hours. Stock markets have recovered confidence following the conclusion of the political crisis in Russia, with London again finding the US buyers who had backed off last month when they switched to the French and German markets. In the UK market, hopes that base rates may be cut soon have quickened during the Conservative party conference now unfolding in Blackpool, the north of England seaside resort. Equity market optimism was sustained yesterday by firmness in the government bond market. Confidence continued to spread across the full range of the stock market, lifting the FT-SE Mid 250 Index by 13.9 points to 3,471.6 - this Index peaked at 3,513.3 at the end of August. Business in non-Footsie listed stocks, at around 53 per cent, returned to average daily levels. Trading volume increased towards the close but the day's Seaq total of 696.4m shares remained short of Tuesday's 774.3m, which was worth Pounds 1.33bn in retail business. Oil shares rebounded yesterday and there was support for the pharmaceuticals. But the strongest features were the interest rate-orientated sectors, including properties, merchant banks and construction issues. The stock market hopes for a buoyant speech from the chancellor of the exchequer, and hopes he will set the scene for a November budget which will be stimulative for the domestic economy and favourable to prospects for the equity market.</p>

			<p><P> May 19, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FINANCIAL MARKETS;  </P> <P> STOCKS ;  </P> <P> TRADERS IGNORE INFLATION DATA; DOW GAINS 7.69  </P> <P> The stock market pushed ahead to a new post-crash high Thursday, undeterred by  a government report on inflation that was slightly worse than expected.  </P> <P> The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials rose 7.69 to 2,470.12, surpassing the  19-month high of 2,463.89 it reached Monday.  </P> <P> Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 5 to 4 in nationwide trading of  New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 826 up, 655 down and 515 unchanged.  </P> <P> Big Board volume came to 177.48 million shares, down from 191.21 million  Wednesday. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including  trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter  market, totaled 216.21 million shares.  </P> <P> The Labor Department reported that the consumer price index rose 0.7% in April,  bringing the increase in the index so far in 1989 to an annual rate of 6.6%.  </P> <P> The monthly number came in near the high end of advance estimates on Wall  Street and apparently disappointed some traders who had been hoping for a  pleasant surprise in the data.  </P> <P> Still, analysts noted that much of the increase came, as expected, from a jump  in energy prices that is not considered likely to be repeated in coming months.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Expect Prices to Fall  </P> <P> The increase in gasoline prices was the largest one-month gain since the Labor  Department began keeping track in the 1930s. Economists believe that fuel  prices will fall because of signs of stepped-up production by oil-producing  countries and removal of supply disruptions associated with the Alaska oil  spill.  </P> <P> The view that the size of the energy price increase was an unusual occurrence  left the door open for stock market bulls who contend that the Federal Reserve  has a good chance of succeeding in its effort to restrain inflation without  pushing the economy into a recession.  </P> <P> Avon Products led the NYSE active list, down 7 1/8 at 33 on turnover of more  than 5.8 million shares. Amway Corp. withdrew a $39-a-share takeover bid for  the company after Avon's board rejected the offer.  </P> <P> Gainers among the blue chips included International Paper, up 1 1/4 at 49 1/4;  American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, up 1/2 at 35 1/8; Philip Morris, up 1/2 at  136, and International Business Machines, up 1/2 at 112.  </P> <P> Federal National Mortgage gained 2 3/4 to 80 1/8, trading at record highs as  the company, which has been reaping increasing profit as a central force in the  growing secondary market for mortgages, held its annual meeting.  </P> <P> Fannie Mae stock has risen 6 7/8 since the start of the week. Last year it  traded as low as 29.  </P> <P> On the Tokyo stock market, share prices closed lower after two straight days of  rises in featureless, thin trading. The dollar's sharp rise against the yen has  kept most investors sidelined worrying if and when the Bank of Japan will raise  the discount rate.  </P> <P> The Nikkei index fell 136.12 to close at 33,856.33.  </P> <P> In London, stocks closed sharply higher for the second straight session,  strengthened partly by takeover speculation.  </P> <P> The Financial Times 100-share index rose 21.5 to 2,177.3.  </P> <P> Currency  </P> <P> Central banks battered down the dollar in a battle with currency dealers who  had driven the currency sharply upward in recent weeks.  </P> <P> Traders shrugged off the central bank dollar sales at first, but the rally  broke by late morning trading in New York when the dollar hit its highest point  in years against key currencies.  </P> <P> Still, the dollar finished the day less than half a percent below its levels of  late Wednesday, indicating that traders remained willing to challenge the  resolve of government bankers and finance officials.  </P> <P> "We have a market that still wants to test the upside potential for the  dollar," said Nicholas Sargen, a Salomon Bros. analyst.  </P> <P> He said estimates of the official dollar sales ranged from $1.5 billion to $3  billion, including heavy sales by the Bank of Japan during Tokyo trading hours.  </P> <P> In precious metals trading, gold plunged in late activity to levels not seen  since August, 1986. Republic National Bank of New York reported a late quote of  $368.30, down from $371.75 late Wednesday.  </P> <P> The dollar peaked at 1.9880 West German marks and 139.60 Japanese yen --  approaching what traders consider psychologically important levels of 2 marks  and 140 yen. Reaching those levels could incite further speculative buying,  dealers say.  </P> <P> In London, the British pound rose to $1.6180 from $1.6140 late Wednesday. In  New York, sterling rose to $1.6175 from $1.6115.  </P> <P> In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins, the dollar rose  1.18 yen from Wednesday to close at 138.88 yen. Later in London, the dollar was  quoted at 138.60 yen. In New York, the dollar fell to 138.65 yen from 139.22.  </P> <P> Other late dollar rates in New York, compared to late Wednesday's rates,  included: 1.9670 West German marks, down from 1.9715; 1.7568 Swiss francs, down  from 1.7615; 1.1927 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1908; 6.6585 French francs,  down from 6.6760, and 1,433 Italian lire, down from 1,435.  </P> <P> Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared to late Wednesday, included: 1.9660  West German marks, down from 1.9675; 1.7552 Swiss francs, down from 1.7580;  6.6490 French francs, down from 6.6607; 2.2240 Dutch guilders, up from 2.2150;  1,439.50 Italian lire, up from 1,433.00, and 1.1927 Canadian dollars, up from  1.1925.  </P> <P> Gold held steady in London at $370.75 an ounce. In Zurich, Switzerland, gold  rose to $370.50 from $370.25. Earlier in Hong Kong, gold fell $3.01 to close at  $371.73.  </P> <P> On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current delivery fell  to $369.70 from $373.20.  </P> <P> Silver fell on the London market to $5.43 an ounce from $5.46 on Wednesday. On  New York's Comex, silver for current delivery fell to $5.401 from $5.429.  </P> <P> Credit  </P> <P> The price of long-term government bonds advanced as traders discounted a hefty  overall increase in the consumer price index because it was caused largely by  the rising cost of fuel.  </P> <P> The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond increased 5/16 point, or about $3.10 for  every $1,000 in face value. Its yield fell to 8.77% from 8.81% late Wednesday.  </P> <P> The price of Treasury bills also increased, while short- and intermediate-term  government bonds were mixed.  </P> <P> In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term governments  were unchanged to down 1/16 point, intermediate maturities were unchanged to up  5/32 point and long-term issues rose from 5/32 point to 5/16 point, according  to Telerate Inc., a financial information service.  </P> <P> Yields on three-month Treasury bills rose to 8.65% as the discount rose 9 basis  points to 8.36%. Yields on six-month bills rose to 8.86% as the discount gained  5 basis points to 8.38%. Yields on one-year bills rose to 8.92% as the discount  rose 4 basis points to 8.26%.  </P> <P> The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, traded  at 9.75%, down from 10.25% late Wednesday.  </P> <P> Tables begin on Page 6.  </P></p>

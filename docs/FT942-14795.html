			<p>940419 FT  19 APR 94 / Curry's guilty of race bias A black salesman for electrical retailers Curry's, sacked after swearing at a company race equality executive he mistook for a waitress, was a victim of racial discrimination, an industrial tribunal ruled today. Tribunal chairman Ms Barbara Calvert QC said Mr Dion Deleon would not have been dismissed for gross misconduct if he had been white. She said part of the reason for his sacking was his rowdy behaviour, but noisy white employees with him were not even given a warning. Company claims that his rowdy behaviour had brought them into disrepute, because he was wearing a tie with 'Curry's' written on it, had not been proved.</p>

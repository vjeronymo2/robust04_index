			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / Zeiss 'marriage' a unification story ending in tears: Judy Dempsey chronicles the troubled amalgamation of the east and west arms of the German optical instruments manufacturer The marriage seemed a good idea at the time, says Mr Jurgen Domel, head of the workers' council at Carl Zeiss Jena, the renowned eastern German manufacturer of microscopes, telescopes and optical instruments. 'We had the name. We had the freedom to enter the western markets. We were confident.' There is little evidence of that confidence in Jena today as the management in Carl Zeiss Oberkochen in the nearby western German state of Baden-Wurttemberg prepares to cut 2,400 jobs from its 13,000 strong pay-roll in its west German operations and 600 of the 2,050 workforce in Jena, an old university town set deep in the eastern state of Thuringia. The marriage between the eastern and western parts of Carl Zeiss was arranged by the Treuhand privatisation agency in late 1991. Hailed as an exemplary solution for saving Carl Zeiss Jena, it sought to combine both enterprises under one roof after 45 years of enforced separation. Under the plan, Oberkochen took 51 per cent of Carl Zeiss Jena, while the remaining 49 per cent was placed under Jenoptik, also in Jena. Jenoptik, which specialises in high-tech laser and optical instruments and is managed by Mr Lothar Spath, the former prime minister of Baden-Wurttemberg, is 100 per cent owned by the government of Thuringia. In addition, to save and modernise the entire Carl Zeiss complex, which before unification employed more than 27,000 workers, the Treuhand allocated DM3.6bn (Pounds 1.47bn) of taxpayers' money to Jenoptik with the aim of guaranteeing 10,000 jobs and finding new markets. As for Carl Zeiss Jena, by the end of next year the Treuhand will have pumped in DM587m and kept 2,050 jobs alive. But, laments Mr Elk Littow, manager of Carl Zeiss Jena, 'We invested about DM117m on new buildings and production lines and the remainder has been spent on picking up losses.' Despite introducing new production lines, Carl Zeiss Jena has been making annual losses of about DM140m on a turnover of DM206m, while productivity is still only 40 per cent of Oberkochen's. Recession hit domestic and export markets for the group products before its top heavy management had time to react. 'Yes, we have over-employment,' says Mr Littow. 'But one of the problems is that the expected markets did not materialise. After unification, we lost all our east European and Russian outlets. Half our current sales to the east - a quarter of our total turnover - are now financed by Hermes (Germany's export guarantee state insurance company).' Mr Littow also concedes it had been difficult to integrate Carl Zeiss Jena with Oberkochen. 'We are still making some of the same product lines although we have tried to phase them out'. Indeed, the duplication of product lines is considered one of the main problems in this marriage. But these are linked to what happened to Carl Zeiss after 1945. In July 1945, American troops, which had advanced into Thuringia just before the Red Army, whisked away 127 scientists from Carl Zeiss Jena to the western zone, and with them, they helped re-establish Carl Zeiss at Oberkochen. The remainder of the world-renowned optics and glass enterprise, which had been founded in 1889 by Ernst Abbe and Otto Schott, was brought under state control once the east German communists consolidated their grip over eastern Germany in 1949. The real struggle for the Carl Zeiss name began in earnest. For more than 45 years both Carl Zeiss' produced the same goods. As Oberkochen captured the western markets with its high-quality microscopes, telescopes and optical instruments, Jena went eastwards with similar products. 'It was a struggle between east and west Germany to preserve the name and the products,' says Mr Domel. 'Over that time, the buyers at Carl Zeiss Oberkochen were taught to believe they were the real inheritors of Carl Zeiss Jena. Since unification, we in Jena have been trying to recapture our place on the international markets through the marriage with Oberkochen,' he adds. Yet Mr Domel believes Oberkochen does not want Carl Zeiss Jena to exist. 'We are supposed to be able to market our goods through their distribution network. But we sell more products through our own outlets than through Oberkochen. It's a psychological problem for their marketing people who now have to think about marketing the Jena products. I don't want to believe that this is a struggle between Wessis (west Germans) and Ossis (east Germans). But it is hard to think otherwise, especially since Oberkochen makes the decisions,' he says. 'Look, there was no attempt to integrate Jena and Oberkochen and streamline the product lines,' says Mr Willy Theiracker, a member of Oberkochen's workers' council. 'There was a duplication of product lines. We have been warning the management at Oberkochen for years to restructure. They reacted too late. Of course we fear about jobs going to the east. But we don't want to make this into an east-west struggle.' The group's profit and loss account tells just that story, however. Of operating losses of DM180m in 1993/94, DM140m is attributable to Jena. And the east-west tensions have been heightened by the group's precarious situation. Workers protesting at the western plants about the restructuring programme last week waved banners proclaiming: 'Aufbau Ost, Abbau West. Wir sagen nein' (Building in the east, dismissals in the West. We say no). Oberkochen, which last year had a turnover of DM2.5bn, is now making DM40m losses. But since it owns 51 per cent of Carl Zeiss Jena, managers at Oberkochen believe they will have a freer hand to control losses at that plant in late 1995 when the Treuhand's investment and job guarantee contracts for saving 2,050 jobs expire. However, Mr Bernd Kramer, head of the physical technologies department at the federal ministry for research and technology in Bonn, believes the real problem facing Carl Zeiss is its price structure and growing competition, particularly from the south-Asian markets. 'Carl Zeiss is definitely under pressure from these markets. But anyone buying these top-class instruments have to find a balance between price and quality. Also, if Carl Zeiss wants to become more competitive, the management will have to respond more quickly. It is not yet flexible enough in this field,' adds Mr Kramer. Treuhand and Thuringian government officials agree. They say the difficulties in integrating the eastern and western operations is partly due to inflexible management as well as the problems in marrying two companies which had developed two different marketing philosophies over the past 40 years. That, however, is of little comfort to the taxpayer. 'I keep asking myself what happened to the DM587m of tax-payers money,' says Mr Wilfried Rudolf, a spokesman for the Thuringian government. But he declined to explain why the state did not earlier question the losses since it has an indirect ownership interest in Carl Zeiss Jena through Jenoptik. 'The big deciding question is why the management (at Oberkochen) took so long in finding a concept,' says Mr Spath. Dr Jobst Herrmann, chairman of the Carl Zeiss board, may partly have answered fears about the quality of group management by resigning last week, though he is staying on in the job until a replacement is found. Over the next few days, unions and management from Oberkochen and Jena will meet to decide if the restructuring plans can be implemented. But the governments of Baden-Wurttemberg, Hesse (which has a Carl Zeiss subsidiary) and Thuringia, are reluctant to accept more unemployment and may extend financial aid to both plants. 'At the end of the day, Carl Zeiss, and its name, belongs in Jena,' says Mr Domel. 'Jena's future depends on Carl Zeiss remaining here. Full stop.' 'I wonder if this marriage will even survive,' says Mr Theiracker. 'It will,' says Mr Kramer. 'But it will need time to make it work.'</p>

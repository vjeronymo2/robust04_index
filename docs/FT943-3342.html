			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / International Company News: Disposals continue as Adsteam reduces loss Adsteam, the troubled South Australian group formerly run by Mr John Spalvins, yesterday reported a reduced loss after tax and abnormals of ADollars 164.4m (USDollars 122.4m) for the year to end-June. This compares with a ADollars 440.5m deficit for the previous 12 months. Adsteam took the profit on various asset sales as an extraordinary item, amounting to an aggregate ADollars 893.5m gain against ADollars 108.6m previously. This left net profits for the year at ADollars 333m, compared with last time's ADollars 222.6m loss. The David Jones retail business made an operating profit of ADollars 84.8m, up 13.7 per cent over the previous year. Sales rose 7.3 per cent to ADollars 1.41bn. However, Adsteam acknowledged that its operating businesses could not generate sufficient earnings to service the group's existing debt. 'Recognising this, the group is proceeding with the policy of attempting to dispose of operating businesses and investments at a price and time that will maximise the sale value,' it said. No decisions had been made on the disposal of businesses, but Adsteam's directors indicated that trade sales were unlikely to leave any surplus for shareholders. 'However, there remains the possibility of offers to shareholders of entitlements to subscribe for shares in any business which is subsequently floated,' they said.</p>

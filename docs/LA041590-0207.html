			<p><P> April 15, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DIANNE FEINSTEIN  </P> <P> Thank you for exposing the Feinstein mystique.  </P> <P> The facts, as the article pointed out, are that Dianne loves to portray  working-class ethics only when she can benefit.  </P> <P> Yet she blames others for her lackluster showing.  </P> <P> Her golf picture says it all. There's Dianne using a one iron on a putting  green, wearing shoes that are so new they are not even bent in the toes.  </P> <P> When Feinstein says it's not easy to break into Southern California politics,  it reminds me of something my grandmother used to say: You can only gain the  respect of others when you have learned to work as hard as they do.  </P> <P> JOHN L. RAMIREZ  </P> <P> Port Hueneme  </P></p>

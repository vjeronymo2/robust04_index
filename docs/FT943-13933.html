			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / Books: White Chief in a Velvet Jacket - Jackie Wullschlager on the life of Robert Louis Stevenson THE LETTERS OF ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON, VOLS I and II edited by Radford A. Booth and Ernest Mehew Yale Pounds 29.95each, 525 and 352 pages Fans called him Velvet Jacket, the lovable, smoking Bohemian artist. To others he was Seraph in Chocolate, an arch fin-de-siecle sensualist, possibly over-sweet. On the island of Samoa, he was White Chief, protector of a tribe of former cannibals. By the time Robert Louis Stevenson died in 1894, aged 44, he had become such a mythical, untouchable figure, that, reviewing an early book of letters, a sceptical Henry James said: 'one smells the things unprinted'. Now, in the centenary year of his death, a magisterial eight volumed edition of Stevenson's letters gives us a full rich portrait of the writer. Told in his own voice - or rather in the two voices of someone whose imaginative existence propelled his actual one - his strange short life is riveting. On the one hand, RLS was a romantic, living out the swashbuckling fun of Kidnapped and Treasure Island on voyages to the South Seas and a marriage to a fast, gun-carrying Californian. On the other, there emerges a decent, everyday guy who cared about food and the weather, ran out of cash, and wrote home each week to his mum. RLS is already enjoying a revival as a Victorian New Man - emotional, honest, tolerant, a model of equality in his marriage and his friendships with South Sea islanders. These letters will enhance both his literary reputation and his popular image. Like many children's writers, he never quite grew up, and most of the letters in these two volumes - ending when he was 29 - are to his parents, or the art critic Sidney Colvin and literary hostess Frances Sitwell who supported him when a religious row drove him from his strict Edinburgh family. These form a journal of this critical point in his life, when he was fighting for the freedom to be himself and to write. In becoming 'a horrible atheist', his father said, 'you have rendered my whole life a failure'; to his mother it was 'the heaviest affliction that has ever befallen me.' To RLS, the pampered only child, the break with home was devastating. As Frances Sitwell, 'a sybylline beauty over which time had no power', guided him through the storm, he became infatuated with her. He addresses her as Madonna: 'Your sympathy is the wind in my sails,' and 'you are the very texture of my thought.' Colvin was also in love with her and after a 30-year courtship, she married him. Initially a rival, RLS was devoted to Colvin. 'I can see no harm in my dying like a burst pig upon some outlandish island,' he tells the older man, 'but if you died, without due notice and a chance for me to come and see you, I should count it a disloyalty, no less.' RLS was always sickly: the rapidly changing addresses here as he moved from spa to spa is the journey of a typical Victorian consumptive. After his religious crisis, convalescence in the south of France was psychological as well as physical. It healed wounds, and soon he was writing, in un-Scottish fever pitch, 'my dear father and mother, I wish to do no more today than tell you how much you are in my thoughts, and how much I love you . . . please never imagine that you will lose me, or I lose you, until death interferes . . . do believe that I love you with all my heart.' As his biographer Ian Bell pointed out, Stevenson's style is a sick man's response to the world heightened, distanced, specific. No letter writer has a more intense feel for places. From Scotland 'very cold in body and black at heart,' he writes one summer of the 'high wintry winds, and the grey sky and faint northern daylight,' and air so invigorating 'that my scalp was sore.' In France he swoons over sun-trapped valleys and hikes across the Cevennes with his donkey Modestine' ('65 francs and a glass of brandy'), taking just a change of clothing and a whisk - for his breakfast cocktail of raw eggs. One recalls 'many is the long night I've dreamed of cheese - toasted, mostly', in Treasure Island. The same mix of thrills and homeliness that make his stories so shudderingly authentic informs these letters. 'You may paddle all day long,' he says of a canoeing trip in Belgium in 1876, 'but it is when you come back at nightfall, and look in a familiar room, that you find Love or Death awaiting you beside the stove; and the most beautiful adventures are not those we go to seek.' He ended that trip with a visit to the Barbizon artists, and stopped one night outside the hotel Chevillon near Fontainebleu. Peering through to the dining room, he saw a dark, lively American woman and, to screeching delight from the artists, faltered through the window to sit beside her. She was a married mother called Fanny: she liked him but was unnerved by his habit of bursting into tears. A year later, she cabled from California in distress. RLS caught the next boat across the Atlantic, rescued her from a disastrous husband, and married her. 'Count on Pounds 250 a year,' his father cabled, announcing a reconciliatory allowance. Volume two leaves RLS in the middle of this affair. Many figures from Victorian Britain have come to life, from the crippled editor WS Henley, model for Long John Silver, knocking down Oscar Wilde with his stick, to the 'lighthouse Stevenson's' touring the coast to show off their beacons. The remaining six volumes promise to be as entertaining.</p>

			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / Journalists penalised by Israel ISRAEL yesterday suspended official accreditation of two foreign correspondents - one American and one British - for publishing stories which the authorities said should first have been submitted to the military censor. In theory almost all stories on military and Arab-Israel affairs have to be submitted before publication. But in practice it is left to journalists to judge what to submit. Yesterday's case arose from an incident last month when five Israeli soldiers were killed in an accident during training. Later it emerged that Lt Gen Ehud Barak, the Chief of Staff, and other top officers were present at the time. The military censor was accused by Israeli newspapers of co-operating in a cover-up of serious army misconduct by initially barring publication of these details. As the issue escalated, foreign newspapers began reporting on the incident, including an assertion by the Miami Herald that the training exercise was a practice run for the planned assassination of the leader of Lebanon's Hizbollah Islamic fundamentalist movement. Ms Carol Rosenburg, the Herald's correspondent, had her accreditation withdrawn, as did Mr Ian Black of the Guardian of London.</p>

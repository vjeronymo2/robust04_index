			<p>BFN     [Text] Brother Lieutenant 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, chairman of  the Presidential Council and supreme commander of the Armed  Forces, yesterday chaired a joint meeting of the presidential  council, the speakership council of the House of Representative,  and the Council of Ministers. The meeting dealt with political,  military, security, and economic situations and the overall  national developments in light of the actions committed by the  insurgent secessionist gang in the Socialist Party leadership in  terms of igniting the war and sedition in the homeland and  pushing the Armed Forces into the fire of internecine fighting  with the aim of implementing their secessionist plot to  dismember the country.    The conferees adopted the necessary decisions on these  issues  and situations.    The conferees highly appreciated the glorious and heroic  role  and splendid successes of our armed Forces in the battle to  uphold the people's desire to adhere to unity and protect  constitutional legitimacy and democracy. The conferees  expressed their great satisfaction and appreciation of our  Yemeni people's wide-scale support across the homeland and their  backing and cohesion with their sons and brothers in the Armed  forces to bravely confront the forces of apostasy and secession.    The conferees affirmed that the unity is the fate and  destiny  of the Yemeni people and that there can be no relinquishment or  retreat from unity no matter what the cost.</p>

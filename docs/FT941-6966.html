			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / How to Spend It: Taking the plunge Not since Madonna strapped a black, pointy Gaultier carapace to her bust have bras been so inescapably visible. This time, the commotion is the Wonderbra, undisputed queen of the push-up-and-plunge market for 30 years until January when a rival, Ultrabra, declared itself the 'ultimate in cleavage.' The background is this. The Wonderbra was first made in 1964 by Canadelle, a sister-company of Playtex. Courtauld's Gossard held the licence from 1964 until this year when Playtex snatched it back. With magazines such as Vogue promising a return to curves and a farewell to the superwaif, Playtex could hardly allow arch-rival Gossard to hang on to the lucrative production of the Wonderbra, which has 12 per cent of the UK branded bra market. Now Playtex has the Wonderbra name, it is spending Pounds 1m promoting its range of bras, bodies and panties. There have been glitzy launches, a surfeit of newspaper puns - Storm in a D-Cup, Bra Wars, the Breast is History - and a cheeky poster campaign. Gossard is spending a reported Pounds 2.7m on the Ultrabra, which to the inexpert eye resembles the Wonderbra it used to make: underwired, padded, lacy and with surgical-looking straps: not so much lingerie as engineering. Should those seeking cleavage pick Gossard, with its 30 years' experience making the Wonderbra, or Playtex? Or are the two bras as similar on performance and design as they are on price (Pounds 14.99 for the padded plunge lace)? On closer examination, the bras do look different. Gossard, freed from the production requirements that were tied to the licence, has made changes. Its straps are more angled away from the cups, for uplift, and it looks slightly more delicate with a pearly bow between lower-scooped cups. Gossard will not give details of the 'refinements' it says make the Ultrabra easier to produce. Mark Pilkington, the marketing director, calls the 46 components and 28 sewing stages the 'miracle system'. 'Essentially, it is underwired for uplift, and the way it holds the back down helps to push the front up,' he explains. The Wonderbra has hardly changed. Playtex is not attempting to stray from the principles that made the bra a success 30 years ago - the licence forbids such change. The backs are made of strong nylon powernet, set at a 'very sharp angle' to the cups, to make sure that 'the cup wires sit around the breast at a slight angle pushing it towards the centre front of the body for maximum cleavage.' The consumer can only benefit from bra wars. Gossard and Playtex have introduced different fabrics - broderie anglaise, satin; and colours - raspberry, navy and flame. You will probably need a size larger than you think. Gossard and Playtex's idea of sizing has little to do with reality and everything to do with flattery.</p>

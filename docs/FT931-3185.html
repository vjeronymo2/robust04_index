			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget (What It Means To You): Polite financial advisers point to neutrality - Savers and Investors A NEUTRAL Budget for savers and investors was the verdict of the financial advisers too polite to call it a dull Budget. 'Investors are not particularly damaged by this Budget,' said Mr James Higgins of financial advisers Chamberlain de Broe, 'but it did not throw up new opportunities either.'

The maximum benefit that can be derived from it will be Pounds 344 rather than the Pounds 688 which it is worth to high rate taxpayers. The change most likely to make a difference to personal financial planning is the reduction of mortgage interest tax relief (Miras) from 25 per cent to 20 per cent from April 1994, according to Mr Cole. He said he expected new restrictions on job relocation expenses to hit many people and was surprised that a rise in national insurance contributions was aimed exclusively at employees.

In Brazil, this rate is almost 35 percent,  resembling that in the African countries. However, it is known  that half of all the children infected worldwide contract the  virus at the time of delivery. Based on this information,  researchers are attempting to reduce the number of pediatric  AIDS cases.    "If we succeed in obtaining a method to prevent transmission  of the virus, the result will be good, because these children  are still developing their immune system, and hence have less  resistance to the infections caused by the disease." This  statement was made by the Indian physician, Savita Pahwa, an  immunologist at North Shore University Hospital, in New York.  She arrived in Sao Paulo yesterday to participate in the First  National Meeting on Pediatric AIDS, from 1 to 3 December,  sponsored by the Association To Assist Child Carriers of HIV.    According to Doctor Pahwa, there are, basically two clinical  types of children carrying HIV: those who show symptoms of the  disease during the first months of life, and die by age two; and  those who more easily resist infections, and even survive up to  age 12. She explained: "We are studying the immune systems of  those children to learn the differences between them, and why  some manage to live longer."    Concurrently, the researchers on her team are attempting to  solve what they call the virus "envelope." It consists of a  layer of protein covering the virus, which determines the type  of attack that the latter will make on the immune system of  infected patients. According to Pawha, approximately 1,200  children have already been infected by the virus in the United  States.    The principal treatments used in Brazil are not much  different from those in the developed countries, which use AZT  alone, or combined with two other more modern drugs called DDI  (dideoxynosine, in English) and DDC (dedeoxycytidine). This  system changes the date for starting the use of AZT, as well as  its dosage.    According to Doctor Marinella Della Negra, from the Emilio  Ribas Hospital in Sao Paulo, Brazil was the first developing  country admitted to the protocol for Penta I research (the  acronym for the accord regarding the European Economic  Community's Pediatric AIDS Studies). That accord includes  collaborating institutions in Italy, Portugal, Belgium, France,  and Germany.    The doctor claims: "That is one of the most modern European  studies, and from now on we shall be able to gain access to its  reports." Currently receiving seven new pediatric AIDS cases per  week, she comments: "Three years ago, the average was two per  week."</p>

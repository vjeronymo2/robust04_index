			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture (Week in the markets): Coffee prices reach 9-month highs THE RECENT turnround in coffee market sentiment following news of a smaller crop in Brazil, the biggest producer, was maintained this week. But the continued advance, which lifted robusta coffee prices at the London Futures and Options Exchange to fresh nine-month highs, chiefly reflected technical factors. After a Dollars 12-a-tonne setback on Monday, the uptrend that last week added Dollars 47 to the January futures position got back into full swing on Tuesday, when technically-inspired US investment fund buying pushed the price up Dollars 33 to Dollars 924 a tonne. Although producers remained reluctant to sell the market needed a period of consolidation before moving further ahead, and profit-taking on Wednesday and Thursday saw the January price fall back to Dollars 915 a tonne. Yesterday, however, the bulls were back in the driving seat and the January quotation touched Dollars 944 a tonne before closing up Dollars 26 on the day and Dollars 38 on the week at Dollars 941 a tonne. Dealers told the Reuter news agency that technically the New York and London markets looked set to move higher and that the next 'upside' target was Dollars 950 a tonne for London's January contract. Cocoa prices also moved higher early in the week, the March position in London touching a nine-month high of Pounds 734 a tonne on Tuesday. But that largely reflected sterling's weakness against the dollar. By yesterday's close the price had surrendered its rise, ending the week Pounds 3 down on balance at Pounds 705 a tonne. The market was not looking forward with much optimism to next week's session of talks on renegotiating the moribund International Cocoa Agreement. So far little progress has been made on the crucial issues of how a new pact's price support operations would be financed, what 'floor' and 'ceiling' prices would be defended and how output would be controlled. 'We always approach the talks with a certain amount of optimism, but we know how the state of affairs was at the end of the second session in July,' consumer spokesman Mr Jan van Sluisveld told Reuter. 'We note the positions are far away from each other.' At the London Metal Exchange cash copper ended the week at Pounds 1,452 a tonne, up Pounds 69 a tonne, but Pounds 40 of that reflected sterling's reduced value. Early in the week the copper price rise had also been encouraged by a threatened strike by workers at Codelco, the Chilean state metals group, over government privatisation plans. But the threat faded after union leaders welcomed the government's offer of negotiations. Copper market sentiment was depressed, meanwhile, by a further rise of 7,250 tonnes in LME warehouse stocks, taking the total to 314,400 tonnes, the highest since January. LME zinc stocks were also up - by 9,225 tonnes to 386,800 tonnes - and prices remained under pressure. The cash price ended the week at a 9 1/2  month low of Dollars 1,092.50 a tonne, down Dollars 16.50 on the week. The price slide, which has wiped Dollars 237.50 off the cash zinc price since the beginning of this month, resulted in a decision this week by Curragh Resources, the Canadian mining group, to close its 500,000-tonnes-a-year Faro zinc-lead complex in the Yukon for 16 days over the Christmas period. But analysts said that would not be enough to turn the market round. 'Zinc will need a much bigger shock than this,' said Mr Nick Moore of Ord Minnett, part of the Westpac banking group. 'Production cutbacks so far have been pretty tentative but this price of about 50 cents a lb will force producers to make more cuts.' Tin and nickel prices fell in early trading on Monday in response to news of British Steel's plans for production cuts. But dealers described that as a 'knee-jerk' reaction and doubted that the BS move would have much long-term impact on the markets unless there was a round of substantial production cuts in the European steel industry. Both metals ended the week lower, nevertheless, although tin steadied yesterday after the announcement of another fall in LME stocks, taking the total to the lowest level since July. The gold price broke through the bottom of its recent trading range this week following a wave of selling, initially from Europe - principally Germany and the UK - and then, on Tuesday, from the Middle East. The Dollars 341-a-troy-ounce support level gave way and the price bottomed at Dollars 336.70 an ounce, before recovering to end the week Dollars 3.60 down on balance at Dollars 339.65 an ounce.  ------------------------------------------------               LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS  ------------------------------------------------ (As at Thursday's close) tonnes  ------------------------------------------------ Aluminium      +8,075 to 1,423,125 Copper         +4,675 to   314,400 Lead           +4,625 to   187,575 Nickel           +438 to    56,040 Zinc           +6,450 to   386,800 Tin              -110 to    14,460  ------------------------------------------------</p>

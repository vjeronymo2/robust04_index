			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by E. S. Zabalkanskiy, M. Ye. Levin; UDC 621.375] </F>   [Abstract] A method is proposed for studying nonlinear  distortions in a circuit with complex nonlinearity. This method  involves a transformation analysis of the spectrum of complex  envelope of analytical signals on the complex equivalent  characteristic of instantaneous values representing the  nonlinearity. An algorithm for the spectrum transformation on a  nonlinear element with specified amplitude and phase-amplitude  characteristics and a program for its execution was  developed.The algorithm includes the following operations:  computation of the amplitude characteristics of the ``real''  A[.sup]c[/] and``imaginary'' A[.sub]s[/] signal  transmission channels from specified amplitude and  phase-amplitude characteristic; approximation of the  A[.sup]c[/] and A[.sub]s[/]characteristic by odd  exponential polynomials, etc. References: 9 Russian</p>

			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / International Company News: NEC heads for red but its mood stays bright - Michiyo Nakamoto analyses problems facing Japan's leading semiconductor producer FOR a businessman who has just struggled through one of the worst years for Japan's microchip industry, Mr Hajime Sasaki, NEC's vice-president in charge of semiconductors, appears surprisingly relaxed about the company's prospects. Earlier this month, NEC forecast it would plunge into the red in the year to March 31. Due to a downturn in demand for its products, including semiconductors, NEC said it would incur consolidated pre-tax losses of Y40bn (Dollars 338m). As recently as last November, it forecast profits of Y10bn. During the year, NEC lost its ranking as the company with the largest share of the world semiconductor market to Intel, the US company, according to Dataquest, the market research and consultancy group. In fact, NEC's plight contrasts sharply with the improving fortunes of Intel, which last year increased sales by more than Dollars 1bn to Dollars 5.84bn and pre-tax profits by 31 per cent to Dollars 1.07bn. Motorola, another US company, also had a strong year, increasing semiconductor revenue by 22 per cent to Dollars 4.64bn. The main reason for the hardship faced by Japanese semiconductor companies is the steep fall in demand from the domestic market. The Japanese market for semiconductor integrated circuits fell by nearly 12 per cent in 1992. In contrast, the US and Asia-Pacific semiconductor markets grew by about 20 per cent. 'There has never before been such a regional gap in consumption growth,' Mr Sasaki says. NEC depends on its home market for 75 per cent of its sales. 'So, even if exports grow, their impact is limited,' Mr Sasaki says. Demand for semiconductors in Japan plunged as the main purchasers - the consumer electronics, vehicle and personal computer (PC) industries  - saw sales evaporate with the local economic slowdown. PC sales fell by 10 per cent in 1992, while television and video tape recorder sales shrank by 8 per cent and 12 per cent respectively, according to the Electronics Industries Association of Japan. Demand for cars has been so weak that Nissan, Japan's second-largest car producer, has been forced to close one of its main plants. Moreover, the US is expected to increase pressure on Japan to ensure foreign semiconductor manufacturers get a larger share of the Japanese market when market share figures for the fourth quarter of 1992 are announced this month. The outlook for Japanese semiconductors remains bleak, due to the continuing slump in the consumer electronics industry and in capital investment by domestic corporations. However, Mr Sasaki is optimistic about NEC's prospects. 'We expect a 10 per cent increase in worldwide demand for semiconductors.' Demand has picked up strongly for dynamic random access memory chips (D-Rams), in particular, where NEC has an advantage over other companies. As research and development costs are large, it pays to be in the D-Ram market only if a company can produce in large volumes. NEC is one of perhaps five Japanese companies that does. Mr Sasaki is also optimistic that the US will not impose sanctions, even if foreign manufacturers fail to attain the 20 per cent market share targeted by the US. The US and Japanese semiconductor industries have become so closely intertwined that imposing sanctions on Japan would impact on US companies as well, he says. For example, NEC has a design and manufacturing agreement with MIPS, the US company, on reduced instruction set computing (Risc) chips, a deal with Micron Semiconductor to sell each others' memory products, and is talking to American Tele-phone &amp; Telegraph about developing quarter-micron technology for future generation 256-megabit memory chips. NEC announced this month it would drastically reduce production of its own 1Mbit D-Ram and compensate for this by increasing imports from Micron Technology of the US. The move not only helps NEC open up plant space for 4Mbit D-Ram production, which is expected to peak next year, but is also aimed at defusing trade friction with the US. Meanwhile, further alliances are likely between Japanese semiconductor makers as a way of sharing research and development costs. NEC is also carrying out a programme to halve costs in its semiconductor operations by 1994. This includes designing products requiring fewer steps in the manufacturing process, to allow a reduction in factory space and equipment. However, analysts are asking whether these moves are sufficient. Mr Shigeru Yoshinaka, semiconductor analyst at BZW, points out that NEC has invested heavily in D-Ram production but, ironically, its relatively lower dependence on D-Ram revenue means it is unable to benefit from demand for memory chips to the same extent as its competitors, NEC, meanwhile, depends for about one-third of its semiconductor business on the audio-visual market, which is unlikely to pick up in the near future. While NEC's large size may give it advantages in good times, it also means that, in an economic slowdown, the impact is larger. 'Being a giant, it needs very big customer bases' to use up its capacity, says Mr Mike Jeremy, analyst at Baring Securities in Japan. It is not easy for a generalist company like NEC merely to withdraw from semiconductor products that do not bring high rewards and to focus on where the profits are, Mr Jeremy points out. If the Japanese economy fails to pick up, NEC may find that darker days are yet to come.</p>

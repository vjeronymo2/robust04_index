			<p><P> February 5, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> VIEIRA SEEKS NEWS, NOT GLAMOUR  </P> <P> She could charm a snake or coax an ostrich to remove its head from the sand.  The eyes, intelligent and mischievous; the smile, warm and wry; the voice, low  and vibrant; and above all, the attitude, friendly and unguarded. It invites  you to like her, to relate to her as though she is the nice person who has  moved into your neighborhood and is destined to be your best friend.  </P> <P> And, in a way, 36-year-old Meredith Vieira is new to the block. She recently  moved up from CBS' low-rated and now-defunct magazine show, "West 57th," to her  perch in a higher-priced neighborhood -- the prime location of CBS'  long-running hit, "60 Minutes." She moved in when Diane Sawyer moved out to  take up her million-plus residence at ABC.  </P> <P> And if first impressions count, one suspects that Vieira will change the "60  Minutes" neighborhood considerably. Put it this way: If Diane Sawyer is the  Grace Kelly of television -- the perfectly groomed Ice Queen whose every  gesture seems scripted -- then Meredith Vieira is TV's Debra Winger -- slightly  rumpled, does not wear makeup and likes to dish with neighbors over the back  fence.  </P> <P> And, say those who know her, the public Meredith Vieira and the private  Meredith Vieira are one and the same. "What you see on the air is what you  get," said colleague Steve Kroft, who has worked with Vieira for the last  several years, first on "West 57th" and now on "60 Minutes." Over the dozen or  so years she has been in the business, there have been several attempts to  change her wholesome, good looks into a more sophisticated image.  </P> <P> It happened again, the attempt to make her look more glamorous, just a couple  of weeks ago when she was doing her first "60 Minutes" introduction. But  fortunately, producer Don Hewitt stepped in. "He was smart enough to see it  didn't work, and he had them wash off the makeup." She pauses. "He would never  say this, but the makeup made it almost look like I was trying to replace  Diane. Trying to be glamorous. And it just doesn't work."  </P> <P> What does seem to work for Meredith Vieira is, well, just being Meredith  Vieira.  </P> <P> Right now, the television star and relatively new mother (she is married to  free-lance producer Richard Cohen; their son, Ben, is 11 months old) is sitting  in her spacious CBS office. "It used to be Walter Cronkite's office," she tells  you, a fact that fills her voice with a hint of pride and excitement.  </P> <P> Vieira is committed to doing at least 10 stories a season for "60 Minutes"; the  other correspondents do 20. The question arises: Does this put Vieira on the  so-called Mommy Track in her profession? "Maybe," she replies. "I don't care if  I'm a high-powered career person. . . . I want to be a reporter. That's all I  want to do. . . . I don't like the whole star system. I just like doing my  job."  </P></p>

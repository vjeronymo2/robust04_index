			<p><P> January 21, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW MEXICO STATE GETS FULLERTON'S ATTENTION  </P> <P> Somewhere in New Mexico State's arena, the third-place trophy from the 1970  Final Four rests in dignity.  </P> <P> But the trophy held in current esteem hangs from the rafters of the Pan  American Center, a harpooned and bloodied fake shark that commemorates the  Aggies' upset of Nevada Las Vegas less than two weeks ago.  </P> <P> Cal State Fullerton will not be so honored after its 75-58 loss to New Mexico  State on Saturday in front of 11,791. It was too easy.  </P> <P> Instead, the Aggies (15-2) are bent on getting what they just missed last  season, an invitation to the NCAA tournament. And they wouldn't mind a national  ranking as well.  </P> <P> If Fullerton Coach John Sneed had a vote after New Mexico State leap to a 28-8  lead, the Aggies would get it.  </P> <P> "They came out hot as fire," Sneed said. "Every possession -- on the boards,  the three-pointer. They've got one vote for the top 20 here. They really do."  </P> <P> The game wasn't 37 seconds old when New Mexico State's Michael New dunked off  an alley-oop pass from Randy Brown. About 20 seconds later, Keith Hill made a  three-point shot. Fullerton's Cedric Ceballos managed to score on a tip-in, but  the Titans could not slow the Aggies.  </P> <P> New Mexico State's Reggie Jordan scored on an offensive rebound and the Aggies  stole the ball, but missed two easy shots. New, who grabbed 15 rebounds and  scored 11 points, followed with a dunk. Fullerton committed a turnover and  Brown hit a three-point basket. The score was 12-2, with less than three  minutes gone.  </P> <P> By halftime, Fullerton (9-7, 3-4) trailed, 39-22, and had been outshot, 50% to  31%, and outrebounded, 22-13.  </P> <P> Fullerton recovered somewhat in the second half, cutting the lead to 11.  Ceballos and Mark Hill each scored 19 for the Titans, and David Moody added 13  points and 10 rebounds, both career highs.  </P> <P> The Aggies' outburst was a tribute to their remarkably athletic talent and  their ire after having their undefeated Big West Conference record spoiled in a  72-56 loss to Cal State Long Beach on Monday.  </P> <P> The loss to the 49ers may have cost Coach Neil McCarthy's team its first  national ranking since the end of the 1975 season. The loss also knocked the  Aggies into a first-place tie in the Big West with UNLV. Each has one loss.  </P> <P> The Aggies other loss was to Texas El Paso.  </P> <P> Last season, the Aggies had a 21-11 record, the school's first 20-win season in  10 years. But two of those victories were against non-Division I teams, which  helped keep the Aggies out of the NCAA tournament.  </P> <P> New Mexico State had to settle for the National Invitation Tournament, and the  disappointed Aggies were defeated in the first round by Pepperdine.  </P> <P> This season they again have two non-Division I opponents. Their loss to Long  Beach at the end of a three-game, four-day trip might cost them.  </P> <P> The possibility of a ranking seems postponed, at best.  </P> <P> "I don't think they'll have us in this week," McCarthy said. "I think they know  where New Mexico is now. I think they know it's part of the United States. If  we win our next four or five, maybe we'll get in."  </P> <P> Fullerton's loss, its seventh in 10 road games, ends a stretch in which the  Titans played nine of 11 on the road.  </P></p>

			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets: European equities turnover European turnover figures for July were delayed, and reduced by the holiday season, 18 per cent down on June after falls of 3 per cent for that month and 8.6 per cent in May. This, says Mr James Cornish of NatWest Securities which produces the figures, was in spite of a 5.2 per cent gain in the FT-Actuaries Europe index after its 4.1 per cent fall in June. The smallest falls in turnover were in Spain and in the UK, down by just 1.8 and 2.5 per cent respectively; the biggest were in France and Belgium, each down by nearly one-third, followed by the Netherlands and Germany, down 30.3 per cent and 23 per cent.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- EUROPEAN EQUITIES TURNOVER  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Monthly total in local currencies (bn)  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Bourse                Apr        May       June       July          US                      1994       1994       1994       1994  Dollars bn  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Belgium             69.93      73.08      71.22      43.50        1.33 France             145.17     175.15      215.7     145.26       26.75 Germany            188.00     151.07     165.42     127.41       80.18 Italy             105,964     99,228     59,404     49,940       31.43 Netherlands         25.20      21.80      26.40      18.40       10.33 Spain            1,160.49   1,340.00   1,308.75   1,282.19        9.82 Switzerland         23.93      26.12      21.63      18.58       13.81 UK                  48.57      44.27      46.32      45.16       69.33  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Volumes represent purchases and sales.

			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / Major considers summer reshuffle to lift party morale: Government survives rebellion over imposition of VAT on energy MR JOHN MAJOR signalled yesterday that he may be prepared to respond to the slump in the government's popularity by reshuffling his cabinet this summer. Only hours after the prime minister chaired an inquest into the disastrous Conservatives performance in last Thursday's elections, fresh evidence of party disarray emerged as Tory MPs voiced concern over the imposition of VAT on gas and electricity. A handful of Conservative MPs last night refused to support the government during a Commons debate on the details of this year's Budget. Though the government survived the rebellion, its majority was cut to 10, and the show of defiance by the rebels was all the more embarrassing, coming so soon after ministerial appeals to the party to unite and keep its nerve. Although Sir Norman Fowler, Conservative chairman, publicly ruled out a reshuffle within the next few days or weeks, the prime minister's office did nothing to dispel expectation at Westminster that Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, would be moved in a July reshuffle. Asked about possible cabinet changes, a spokesman, in an implicit acknowledgment that a reshuffle was under consideration, said: 'The timing of such things will not be affected by what happened last week.' Mr Major was yesterday warned by Sir Norman that he needed to restore his authority as party leader. Downing Street said the prime minister was prepared to listen more to voters' concerns and was keen that government policies were 'geared to strengthening and broadening the economic recovery'. But Mr Major appears equally determined not to be forced into panic reversals of key government policies. Mr John Patten, education secretary, said there would be no backdown in his clash with teachers over the principle of schools testing. But there were signs that Mr Major was ready to respond to pressure from other ministers for a tactical retreat on this summer's tests. The prime minister was said to be anxious to explore whether a truce could be reached while the government was reviewing the nature of the tests. Last night, however, the department of education insisted the tests would remain compulsory, and it denied there was any split with Number 10. The defensive atmosphere in Whitehall was highlighted by complaints from the prime minister's office of 'personal bitterness' and 'twisted' newspaper reports against the government. Sir Norman will use a speech to the Scottish Tory party conference tomorrow to urge party unity around areas of agreement - the economy, free enterprise and reform of industrial relations. Mr Major addresses the conference on Friday. Cabinet will discuss on Thursday next year's legislative programme. It faces a long list of possible bills, many - such as on equalising male and female state retirement ages - highly controversial. A senior Tory official said the priority now was a 'sensible and popular' programme. However, no clear consensus has emerged among ministers or backbench MPs about the best prescription for restoring Tory party fortunes. An appeal yesterday by Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, for Tories 'to keep your nerve' could not paper over divisions between left and right, and between pro and anti-European factions in the party.

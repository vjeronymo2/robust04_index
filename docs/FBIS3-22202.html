			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Sergey Ostanin] </F>   [Text] Moscow, Feb 17 (TASS) -- Phased out nuclear-powered  Russian submarines may pose a radiological threat, Rear Admiral  Nikolay Yurasov, head of the Inspectorate for the Nuclear Safety  of Nuclear Power Units under the Russian Defence Ministry, said  at a press conference today.    According to Yurasov, the submarines whose service life is  over were made radiologically safe. Measures needed for  ensuring it continue to be taken. However, much money is needed  for keeping the submarines afloat, ensuring their stability and  resistance to flooding. The maintenance of phased out  nuclear-powered ships, nuclear reactors and obsolete nuclear  storage facilities also costs a lot to the Russian Navy.    Responding to the question [by] ITAR-TASS, Yurasov did not  mention the exact amount of money needed for resolving those  problems and said the figures should be updated. Yurasov  stressed that in 1992 the government allocated to them only 15  percent of the money they really need, while in 1993 they did  not receive anything at all. According to Yurasov, the  government is pinning its hopes on the federal budget, while  most local administrations are doing nothing to help the navy  resolve its financial and ecological problems.    In 1993 150 nuclear safety inspections were held at Russian  nuclear power units, Yurasov continued. Thirty-seven  instructions were issued for carrying out work which is  dangerous from the radiological point of view. On the whole, no  radiologicaly dangerous situations or conditions for them were  registered at the nuclear power units of the Russian Navy in  1993. ``Safety is being fully ensured at all nuclear power  units,'' Yurasov stressed.</p>

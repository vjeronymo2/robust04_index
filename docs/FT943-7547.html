			<p>940823 FT  23 AUG 94 / Ex-prisoner challenges HK election law Mr Lau San-ching, a 41-year-old social worker, has thrown an embarrassing spanner into the workings of Hong Kong's first set of fully democratic elections. Earlier this month his application to stand for the coming District Board Elections was rejected on the grounds that he was not 'ordinarily resident' in Hong Kong for the 10 years preceding the election, as stipulated under the colony's electoral laws. Mr Lau, who was yesterday granted leave to appeal against the returning officer's decision, spent much of the past 10 years in China as a political prisoner. His absence from Hong Kong was not voluntary, but puts him in the same category as those who have gone overseas to study or work. In an open letter to Ms Anson Chan, acting governor during the absence of Mr Chris Patten, the governor, Mr Lau wrote: 'It is not just a twist of fate that I found myself spending 10 of the best years of my life in a Chinese jail. . . Instead of following the trendy pursuit of money, power and fame, I discovered that my calling in life was in the establishment of democracy, respect for human rights, and restoration of law and order in China. It was with these objectives that I clashed with the Chinese authority; this eventually resulted in loss of my freedom for 10 years.' The government is adamant that the rule of law must apply. 'We have rule of law here, and if people want to challenge that, we have an independent judiciary. Bureaucrats and politicians have to make decisions based on the law, taking legal advice where necessary, and that's what we have done in this case,' a government official said. Further, the government believes that even assuming any amendments to the electoral laws were necessary, these should not be made while an election is going on as that would be unfair: any change will bring potential losers as well as potential gainers. The appeal hearing on Friday may change that: yesterday's leave to appeal was supplemented with a pledge to do everything to put Mr Lau's candidature on a level footing with his fellow contestants, who will have a head start in their campaigning. Mr Lau's lawyers are arguing over the interpretation of 'ordinarily resident'. During his involuntary stay in China, he kept his home address in Hong Kong; he did not rent a flat or take a hotel room in China; and he returned to Hong Kong immediately on his release. His lawyers will claim the residency rule is against the Bill of Rights, which grants every permanent resident the right and opportunity of access to public service in Hong Kong without distinction on the basis of race, sex, political opinion or any other prejudice. They will also attempt to prove a more complex legal point - that those who drafted the residency clause did not have legal power to make such a requirement. There is no such requirement in Britain. The district board elections, on September 18, will mark the first time all 346 seats go up for direct election.</p>

			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / Multinational police force in line for Haiti The White House yesterday announced that up to 12 nations had agreed to join a US-led force to police Haiti in the event of ousted president Jean-Bertrand Aristide being restored to power. Indications of growing consensus on Haiti came as Mr Aristide demanded that the international community take 'swift and definitive' action to remove the republic's current military leadership. Although he added that he was constitutionally prohibited from calling for military intervention - a stance which has previously been seen as a stumbling block to multilateral military action - his statement appeared to be a veiled endorsement of a US invasion. President Bill Clinton has repeatedly said that military intervention is an option in attempts to restore democracy. Ms Madeleine Albright, US ambassador to the United Nations, said that Argentina, Chile, Brazil, Barbados, Jamaica, Trinidad, Guyana, Suriname, Belize, El Salvador and Honduras had agreed to participate in a multilateral force. According to Caribbean officials, in a series of meetings last week, Mr William Gray, the US adviser on Haiti, and senior representatives of the US National Security Council, the Defence Department and the US army, told Caribbean leaders that the US would invade Haiti if the military regime had not imploded within three weeks. The Americans had said that the US would only take this course of action if the United Nations Security Council judged it necessary However, the US was 'alarmed' at the increase in refugees from Haiti over the previous fortnight and had told Caribbean leaders that it felt the only way to end the flow of boat people was to force the military to leave office. The US was willing to play a prominent role in a multilateral operation to that end, Caribbean officials said. However, congressional and administration officials in the US yesterday insisted that only US forces would be used in the initial phases of an invasion. The US military could later be reinforced and replaced by a multinational peacekeeping team, US officials said. Caribbean leaders confirmed that the US government wanted them, as Haiti's neighbours, to contribute to an international military and police force, which would maintain security and public order in the early days after Mr Aristide's return. Mr Christopher Thomas, acting secretary general of the Organisation of American States, said in Washington that the OAS had been discussing a multilateral 'reconstruction effort' that could include peacekeeping troops which would move in after Mr Aristide's return. Meanwhile, senior administration and Pentagon officials said that US forces had rehearsed an emergency evacuation of civilians on the island of Great Inagua, in the Bahamas, on Wednesday. The operation was similar to the operation that would be used to rescue US or other citizens from Haiti, they said. The 400 US Marines who carried out the exercise are part of a force now numbering 2,800, which is positioned off Haiti's coast. Their mission is to evacuate the 5,000 US nationals in Haiti should their lives be in danger. The White House also expressed alarm yesterday over deteriorating human rights conditions in Haiti. As UN human rights observers left Haiti under orders from Lt Gen Raoul Cedras, Haiti's de facto ruler, officials from the US embassy in Haiti were investigating the deaths of 12 Haitian men whose bodies were found near the Haitian capital, Port-au-Prince. The US state department issued a strong rebuke to the Haitian regime over the killings.</p>

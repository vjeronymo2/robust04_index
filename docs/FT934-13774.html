			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / Welsh Office tightens control of WDA THE WELSH Office is to tighten its monitoring of government-funded agencies in Wales following scathing criticism of the Welsh Development Agency by the Commons public accounts committee. The government move came as the development agency took disciplinary action against three senior executives. The agency's chief executive resigned on Monday. Speaking in the Commons, Mr John Redwood, Welsh secretary, said that government-funded agencies in Wales had been 'reminded of the need for the highest standards of probity and fairness in the conduct of public business and of the requirement to comply with rules and guidance'. His intention was 'to achieve a more strategic and effective style of monitoring'. Mr Redwood was giving his response to the Commons Public Accounts Committee's critical report on the WDA which was published in July. The committee attacked the Welsh Office and the WDA's senior management for 'a catalogue of serious and inexcusable breaches of expected standards of control and accountability'. The MPs criticised such matters as the recruitment of a convicted fraudster as a marketing director and an unauthorised redundancy scheme. Mr Redwood, who became Welsh secretary in May, said it was clear from an independent inquiry into the committee's findings that his predecessors, Lord Walker and Mr David Hunt, were not to blame and 'the primary responsibility lay at executive level in the WDA'. Mr Ron Davies, Labour's shadow Welsh secretary, said Mr Redwood had been 'almost contrite' in acknowledging the extent to which the WDA 'ran out of control'. Mr David Rowe-Beddoe, chairman of the WDA, said the agency would implement the recommendations of the inquiry. In addition, he would carry out a review of the agency's organisation. Mr Rowe-Beddoe disclosed that Mr Michael Henry, an executive director, had been dismissed; Mr Ian Rooks, marketing director, had been demoted; and Mr Alun Daniel, director of rural initiatives, had been reprimanded.</p>

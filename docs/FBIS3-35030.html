It also reveals that  Israel made further gains as a result of this deal, which  threatens the conditions of our Palestinian Arab people inside  and outside the occupied homeland.    The paper adds: This, of course, did not come as a surprise.  What is founded on wrong will lead to wrong, and what branches  from mistakes will lead to further damage and harm.    The paper stresses that the Oslo agreement was a stab in the  back of the Palestine question, constituted a major violation of  the Palestinian people's rights, and dealt a strong blow to the  ingredients of the just and comprehensive peace.    The paper says: Events and developments have confirmed these  facts beyond any doubt. The Cairo deal, which discussed the  measures and details of the Oslo Agreement, clearly gave Israel  full control of the occupied territories and gave the occupation  troops the right to absolute control over the security issues,  passages, and roads in Gaza and Jericho. The Cairo deal allowed  Israel to achieve its aggressive objective; that is, not to  return land to its Palestinian owners. Israel also guaranteed  that no Palestinian will be allowed to return to his land and  property.    The paper wonders: What kind of peace is that which the  signatories of the Cairo agreement claim is approaching, when,  according to that peace, the owners of the land are denied the  right to return to their land and those who were expelled and  deported from their land will be denied the right to enjoy  living on it in tranquility and security.    The paper says: The kind of peace which Israel is trying to  promote is the peace of occupation and occupiers that is made at  the expense of Arab lands and rights.    The paper concludes by saying: Agreements such as the Oslo  and Cairo agreements will not achieve the desired peace because  they constitute a surrender, a concession, and a relinquishment.  The Palestinian people will never accept that.</p>

Yesterday the  Democratic Alliance [AD] leader was in Puglia, first at Bari,  then Taranto and Foggia, walking around in a region that has  such a large number of AD supporters and admirers. "Yes, I saw  Occhetto. What can I say? We have provided an illustration of  the progressive alliance's objective of a progressive government  for quite some time back."    [LA REPUBBLICA] Hence, no to Bertinotti and his Communist  Renewal party in a government of the Left?    [Adornato] The problem is simple and we have always stated  it. It is a question of consistency. There are sectors in the  progressive alliance who do not believe in the unity of  progressives, but in that of the Left; moreover, Ingrao said so  just too explicitly, precisely in reference to the word  "progressive" itself. And these sectors do not believe in, or  rather are not looking to governing the country. They believe  in, and are looking to introducing an extremist policy.    [LA REPUBBLICA] Whilst the progressives should...    [Adornato] In the first place we should state that not all  progressives are in this alliance. I am referring in particular  to the Catholic democratic world which has not chosen the AD or  the Christian socialists, but who have preferred to defend,  pointlessly, the political center, which makes no sense under  the majority system.    [LA REPUBBLICA] Let us say, of the progressives.    [Adornato] Good, in this alliance not everyone believes in  or  wants the prospect of governing. And then it is correct to say  that this is not our problem.    [LA REPUBBLICA] Not at all?    [Adornato] No, it does not concern us because our intention  is to give birth to a large democratic and reformist party which  can govern our country in a totally new way. Communist Renewal?  Nor should one become obsessed with individual parties or  movements; the important thing rather is to overcome the  barriers, though without losing one's own identity.    [LA REPUBBLICA] But is a progressive government possible  without Bertinotti?    [Adornato] I will repeat myself for the umpteenth time: If  certain parties do not have a social and economic policy with  which to govern, that is not our problem. We want to govern.  But we have also loyally accepted the alliance.</p>

			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets: South Africa Equities were sold hard during the afternoon as a lower price for gold, softer world markets and activity ahead of the weekend eroded senti-ment. Gains were seen in sectors related to reconstruction and development, but late declines in other stocks dragged the index down. The overall index shed 25.8 to 5,720.0, industrials 27.6 to 6,879.6 and gold 17.1 to 1,911.4. De Beers shed R1 to R89, while Anglos eased 50 cents to R229.50.</p>

			<p>920103 FT  03 JAN 92 / Success of flexible working questioned CHEMICAL companies introducing flexible working practices have generally failed to anticipate the range of training provision required, according to a survey of the industry. The survey was carried out by the Chemical Industries Association last year in response to the 'widespread interest in flexibility' throughout the industry. Responses came from 30 per cent of the association's membership, employing about 20,000 manual workers. Companies underestimated the resources needed to implement flexible working practices, according to a report accompanying the results. It said: 'The principal reason for this is that in many cases individuals have to be retrained and reassessed in their core skills before they can assume any additional skills. Validation is particularly important when the acquisition of new skills is linked to enhanced rates of pay.' The report added that pitfalls were likely to be encountered when introducing flexible working practices. These included pay, training and fears over job security. The report said the main dilemma over pay was whether rates should be enhanced when flexibility agreements were made, or after completion of training or utilisation of additional skills. The report said the knock-on effects on other groups of employees, particularly where there were long-established or formalised differentials, should also be taken into account.

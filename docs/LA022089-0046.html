			<p><P> February 20, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ENVIRONMENTAL LOOPHOLE  </P> <P> A critical gap in state environmental law turned up last year during a  controversy over building a hazardous-waste incinerator in Vernon. The loophole  involves gathering full information on past health and safety violations, if  any, by firms proposing to build such plants. A bad record should weigh heavily  in an agency's judgment about permiting a new facility. It also would be  something that the public is entitled to know.  </P> <P> State law requires a government agency to check a firm's past environmental  record while itis deciding whether a proposal to build a waste-treatment plant  requires an environmental-impact report. But the law doesn't require that the  state agency include that information in its public notice about the decision.  </P> <P> In the Vernon case a Times survey of public records found that the company  involved had been cited for dozens of health and safety violations at  infectious-waste incinerators in Garden Grove and Long Beach. Two incinerators  operated by Security Environmental Systems in Garden Grove were shut down in  1986 under pressure from the South Coast Air Quality Management District. In  one case a company official even brandished an open container of medical waste  and told an inspector to dump it on the district's enforcement chief.  </P> <P> Assemblywoman Lucille Roybal Allard (D-Los Angeles) has introduced legislation  to make the law more specific. AB 411 would require a state agency that is  ruling on an environmental-impact statement to include information about any  major environmental-law violations within the last three years when it  announces its decision.  </P> <P> The proposed legislation also would prohibit the state Department of Health  Services from issuing operating permits for hazardous-waste facilities if a  firm had violated any of the major environmental laws. That's probably too  harsh; a company may have been cited but may have cleaned up its act. This part  of the bill needs refining, but the proposal gives legislators and the  Deukmejian Administration a place to start.  </P> <P> The Vernon case would have been clearer if the public and all the government  agencies involved had been better informed. The more information on the public  record and the tighter the laws regarding the application of that information  to future cases, the better the public will be protected.  </P></p>

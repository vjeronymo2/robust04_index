			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / World Trade News: Tokyo warns EC on audio cassette 'dumping' duties JAPANESE companies could cut their investments in the EC, if Brussels imposes definitive anti-dumping duties on imports of audio cassettes, Tokyo warned yesterday. Japan reserved its right to seek redress from Gatt, should Brussels go ahead with its plan to make definitive the duties of 14.7-22.3 per cent it imposed provisionally last November. The EC Commission is expected to announce its decision shortly, in a case which has aroused doubt among some EC member states, including the UK, and strong opposition from foreign exporters. In sharp terms, Japan told Gatt's anti-dumping committee yesterday that a decision to make duties on audio cassettes definitive would violate the anti-dumping code, and have 'a serious adverse effect on inward investment'. Brussels had failed to demonstrate any causal link between the alleged dumping by Japanese companies and injury caused to EC industry, Japan said. The Commission says the market share of the EC industry had fallen from 27 per cent in 1985 to 19 per cent in 1988, while the share of Japanese, Korean and Hong Kong companies alleged to have dumped had increased from 72 to 81 per cent. But the share of companies found to have dumped included increased output by Japanese affiliates in the EC, Japan claimed. Also, the EC allegation of price-cutting concerned products sold only in Germany, which could not be construed to constitute injury to the entire EC market. Separately, Japan complained about the way the EC Commission had been reviewing duties imposed on electronic typewriters and urged the US to halt an investigation into the Brother company's production of portable electric typewriters in the US. In reviewing the typewriter charges, the Commission had asked Japanese companies for information on word processor production. This extension of the investigation could have no relation to a decision on whether to continue anti-dumping duties on typewriters. It was unnecessarily burdening the companies and interrupting trade flows, Japan said. The US Department of Commerce is investigating a complaint by Smith Corona that Brother is making portable electric typewriters in the US, to circumvent an anti-dumping duty on imports. Japan said the percentage by value of the non-Japanese components in Brother's portable typewriters and word processors produced in the US was more than 50 per cent. Smith Corona was the main importer of portable electric typewriters but produced none of its own domestically. The Commerce Department had opened its investigation without determining whether Smith Corona's complaint was valid.</p>

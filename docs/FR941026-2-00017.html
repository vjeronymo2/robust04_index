			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Further information on BPA's Geothermal Pilot Project Program was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> published prior to the solicitation in an article in a geothermal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> industry trade journal, the Geothermal Resources Council BULLETIN  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (December 1990). The article specified that the projects had to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be in three different resource areas, preferably involving  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> different resource developers. This article was provided to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> developers and others who inquired about the RFP or the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Geothermal Pilot Project Program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> Proposals Received  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Seven proposals were received. Two of them clearly did not meet  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program objectives, and a third was withdrawn by the sponsor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> during the evaluation period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One of the projects not meeting program objectives was located in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Canada. Although projects located outside the United States were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not excluded in the RFP, a foreign project would not have met the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program goal of testing ability to overcome (U.S.) institutional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> barriers to development. Furthermore, a Canadian project would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not be subject to a Bureau of Land Management (BLM) environmental  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A project was proposed at Raft River, Idaho, employing a power  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cycle (the ``Kalina'' cycle) considered to be precommercial.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Testing new power plant technologies was not a goal of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program, and previously developed sites were specifically  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> excluded by the RFP. In the early 1980s, Raft River was the site  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of a demonstration plant developed by the U.S. Department of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Energy. Sponsors of the Canadian and Raft River projects were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notified on October 30, 1991, that their proposals had been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eliminated from consideration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Four proposals received detailed evaluation. They were:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;A proposal by the California Energy Company (CEC) and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Eugene Water &amp; Electric Board (EWEB) for a 30&hyph;MW  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> project at Newberry Volcano, Oregon.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;A proposal by Vulcan Power Company (Vulcan) for a 30&hyph;MW  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> project at Newberry Volcano, Oregon.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;A proposal by Trans-Pacific Geothermal Corporation for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a 30&hyph;MW project at Vale, Oregon.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;A proposal by Unocal Corporation for a 14&hyph;MW project at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Glass Mountain, California.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> Evaluation Process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Proposals were evaluated by a project team composed of BPA staff.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two sets of criteria were used. The first set, considered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``threshold'' criteria, were the criteria stated in the RFP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposals were eliminated from further consideration if they  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> failed to meet any of these criteria except the utility cost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sharing requirement. Threshold criteria included:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Resource area considered capable of producing at least  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 100 MW <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Since BPA required the sites to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> undeveloped, there was no way to know reservoir size  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with much certainty for the proposed sites. If better  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> data were not available, a resource estimate by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> U.S. Geological Survey or some other authoritative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> source was considered sufficient basis for meeting this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> criterion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Suitable for operation as a unit <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . For the purpose of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conserving the resource, Federal geothermal leasing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations allow geothermal leaseholders to unite with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> each other in the development or operation of any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> geothermal resource area. The leases affected by such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a cooperative arrangement are called a unit, and one of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the leaseholders is designated the unit operator. 43  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CFR 3243. BPA wanted to encourage coordinated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> development and avoid resource depletion problems  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> experienced elsewhere, and therefore included  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suitability for unitization as a selection criteria.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The lease block had to be unitized or suitable for unit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operation with the developer as operator. If the area  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was not already unitized, the developer had to control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a large and reasonably contiguous lease block. Bureau  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of Land Management staff were consulted regarding the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suitability of proposed sites for unitization. It  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should be noted that unitization in itself was not the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> objective of this requirement. The objective was to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> encourage coordinated development and conservation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the resource.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Resource area not previously developed for electric  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> power production <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . A program goal was to develop new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resources. If a power project had already been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> developed at a site, the site did not meet this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> criterion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Output contract proposed <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . BPA was willing to purchase  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> output only, not finance projects.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Amenable to BPA receiving an option on future power  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from the lease block <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Since the cost of power from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> first project was expected to exceed the cost of other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resources available to BPA, BPA required a right of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> first refusal on up to 100 MW of additional development  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at each site. Subsequent plants would benefit from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> established infrastructure and lower risks, and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cost of power from them would likely be more cost-effective. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Cost sharing by another utility <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Initiating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> development of Northwest resources would have regionwide benefit. A cooperative effort that included cost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sharing seemed appropriate. It was recognized that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> developers might have difficulty enlisting another  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> utility before BPA identified candidate projects, so  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> failure to meet this criterion did not disqualify a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposal during the evaluation period. Developers were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notified of this.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Project allows BPA to be a cooperating agency in a BLM  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> environmental process <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Staffing constraints would not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allow BPA to be the lead agency in the NEPA review.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This criterion effectively limited projects to Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or Tribal land.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The second set of criteria addressed the developer <!-- PJG 0034 unknown --> s ability to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> complete the project successfully. These are standard criteria  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used by BPA in previous and subsequent solicitations, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> included:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Development team experience <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . How qualified was the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> project team? Had they worked together on previous  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> successful projects? A salaried staff currently  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> involved in project development or in operating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> projects tended to be rated more highly than a listing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of consultants that would be hired for a proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> project. A salaried staff was thought to indicate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> greater stability and commitment by the developer to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maintaining a long term presence in the geothermal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> industry. There was also no guarantee that the listed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consultants would ever work on a proposed project.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Ability to finance the project <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Proven ability to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> finance projects was desired. Was the developer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> experienced in obtaining construction and long term  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> project financing? Was the financing plan realistic?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Audited financial reports were requested from each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> developer, and Dun and Bradstreet financial information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reports were obtained, if available.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Monterrey EL NORTE (Foreign Edition) in  Spanish on page 10A of its 12 March edition publishes a  1,000-word report on an interview with Subcommander Marcos of  the Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN). The report, which  is the second of two parts, is by Juan Manuel Alvarado who  interviewed Marcos "somewhere in the jungle of Chiapas." The  date of the interview is not given.    Alvarado describes Marcos as a "lively" individual who  "suddenly becomes sullen and pensive when he recounts family  members he has not seen for more than 10 years or when he  predicts that his days are numbered." When recalling his early  days in the jungle, Subcommander Marcos points out "he began to  learn the dialect first, and later taught military courses, all  of which helped him become a subcommander." At first, he used  to write "about politics, as well as the domestic and  international situations." He says: "Those were the times of  the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front offensives,"  adding, "things in the USSR were starting to happen, discussions  on the European Common Market had gotten under way, and I had  the option to do just that -- political analysis. Nevertheless,  I was young and strong, and therefore I opted for something  else. My comrades told me I should try the jungle, and so I  did."    When asked about his youth, he says he had a "normal  childhood." He describes his family as middle class, and he  notes that he attended grammar school, high school, preparatory  courses, and college, adding, "I did my graduate work in the  jungle." Marcos is also quoted as saying, "Everything began  with my parents," because from the time he was very young, "my  parents always told us there were injustices in the world, and  one could not just sit back and do nothing. Of course, they  never took up arms. They were not religious people; they only  did it out of love for humanity." Marcos adds, "My parents were  aware of all the injustices, and they considered it their duty  to instruct their children not to remain indifferent."    Subcommander Marcos says he went to "public schools and a  university in one of the provinces," and that in addition to  studying he enjoyed playing baseball, soccer, and basketball,  "but most of all, I enjoyed reading." Alvarado points out that  Marcos did not want to answer any questions about his personal  life, and he would only say he left home as an adolescent and  does not know if any of his brothers are alive.    Subcommander Marcos says: "Up until 1983, I did not  participate in any movements, and that is why I tell  photographers they are wasting their time by taking my picture.  My photo is not in any file, not even in the Traffic  Department's files, much less as a foreign agent. My ski mask  does not hide a face with a past but, rather, a face without a  future."    In concluding the interview, Subcommander Marcos says: "I  was surprised when it was said we were awakening the people.  The truth is that we wanted to awaken them, but we thought it  was going to take much longer, and that other factors would  influence this process. If we had foreseen how seriously our  words would be taken by the people, we would have told them many  more things we have not yet said, because we are just starting  to feel our way."</p>

			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / Humberside and N Yorks face axe HUMBERSIDE and North Yorkshire counties would be abolished and replaced by seven unitary local authorities under recommendations published yesterday by the Local Government Commission for England. Three of the authorities would revert to the ancient Yorkshire title of Ridings. But Lincolnshire's two-tier structure would remain intact, with the status quo unchanged. The commission's four reports so far this year have in all cases recommended abolishing county councils and replacing them with unitary authorities. Arguing for leaving Lincolnshire unchanged, Sir John Banham, chairman of the commission, said: 'If it ain't broke, don't fix it.' If, as some district councillors claimed, there was genuine popular feeling to replace the county with unitary authorities, he would expect protests. Consultation would test which view was correct. Two of the new authorities being created out of Humberside are on the south bank of the Humber and were in Lincolnshire before 1974. The commission wants to call them North East Lincolnshire - founded on Great Grimsby and Cleethorpes - and North Lincolnshire - based on Scunthorpe, Brigg and Barton. But they would be unitary authorities, administratively separate from Lincolnshire. On the north bank of the river, the rest of Humberside would split into two unitary authorities - the city of Kingston upon Hull and East Riding, including Beverley, Goole and Selby. North Yorkshire would be carved up into the city of York, West Riding (Dales) - based on Harrogate and Skipton - and North Riding, into which the commission has controversially pushed Richmond, Northallerton and Scarborough.</p>

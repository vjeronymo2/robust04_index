			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Logica almost doubled at Pounds 7m LOGICA, the computing services company, saw pre-tax profits almost double last year as its troubled North American subsidiary returned to the black. The shares rose 10p to close at 140p. Profits before tax were Pounds 7.06m. Last time's Pounds 3.7m was struck after restructuring costs of Pounds 6.4m. Sales were slightly higher at Pounds 200.4m (Pounds 197.8). Earnings per share were 7p, against losses of 1.6p after a higher tax charge of Pounds 4.64m resulting from overseas losses. The proposed final dividend is 2.5p making a total of 3.65p (3.5p) for the year. Year-end cash balances stood at Pounds 13.7m, against Pounds 15m at the beginning of the year. The results have been depressed for the past two years by a combination of the recession in the UK and steep losses in North America. This year sales in the UK grew from Pounds 114m to Pounds 122m with profits slipping from Pounds 8.8m to Pounds 7.1m. North American revenues slipped from Pounds 26.3m to Pounds 23.8m, but the subsidiary ended up Pounds 550,000 in the black, compared with a loss of Pounds 2.7m. The main reversal was in mainland Europe where profits of Pounds 2m last year became a Pounds 1.7m loss as the German economy deteriorated. Mr David Mann, Logica managing director, said he did not expect to see much of a contribution to profits from mainland Europe or elsewhere outside the UK in the coming year. Priority in North America was being given to investment in marketing and sales. Exchange rate movements had contributed nothing to the results. COMMENT Logica has put up a strong performance in its key market, the UK, in atrocious conditions. The computing services sector is suffering unrelieved gloom at present so analysts are taking a cautious view of Logica's improvement. Nevertheless, the management's decision to cut hard and deep last year has been vindicated and the North American black hole has been plugged. Pre-tax profits of Pounds 10m next year, giving a prospective p/e of 13.8, would not seem ambitious.</p>

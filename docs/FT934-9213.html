			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / International Company News: Hoechst may cut dividend again SHAREHOLDERS in Hoechst, one of Germany's big-three chemicals groups, may face a further dividend cut this year following a 40 per cent earnings decline in the first nine months to DM924m (Dollars 543m), chairman Mr Wolfgang Hilger hinted yesterday. The company was likely to withdraw from unprofitable businesses if conditions did not improve, he said. Although he gave no further details, he said he was particularly unhappy about the European fibres business and polypropylene manufacture. The size of the 1993 dividend would depend on developments in the final quarter and the early part of the new year, he added. However, October had not lived up to expectations, prices were still unsatisfactory and there had been no change in incoming orders. The payout last year was cut to DM9 from DM12 a share. The group said the domestic business was not expected to deteriorate further, and seasonal improvements were likely to bolster pharmaceuticals operations in north America. In a gloomy review of the year to the end of September, Mr Hilger highlighted the poor performance at the German parent, Hoechst AG, where operating results were deep in the red. Its pre-tax profits of DM367m, down 55 per cent on 1992, stemmed entirely from investment income, he said. While group turnover was more or less stable at DM34bn, and volume sales were hardly changed and prices were down 1 per cent, nine-month sales at Hoechst AG had dropped 10 per cent. Volumes were 6 per cent lower and prices had dropped 4 per cent. Turnover in the healthcare businesses contributed the largest proportion to group sales for the first time, relegating chemicals and dyes to second place. Worldwide operating profits from pharmaceuticals were DM200m down on the comparable part of 1992.</p>

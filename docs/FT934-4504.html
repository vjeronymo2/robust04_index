			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / Arts: 'The Nutcracker', Kirov style - Ballet Drosselmeyer's disease is a mysterious scourge. No respecter of persons, it afflicts dancers, public, managements - even critics, who might be thought to be immune - with a mindless desire to see or perform The Nutcracker. Deformity is often part of the sickness, since versions of the ballet can be stupid, revisionist, loaded with as much gimcrackery as a Christmas tree. Yet maddened by a need to hear the score, and often to traduce it, crazed by a lust for snowflakes, giant mice and toy soldiers - you may judge how hideous are the symptoms - the victims flock to theatres, seeking alleviation for this syndrome. Like 'flu it is a winter hazard, and like the new Beijing strain, it is among us now. Five different stagings are threatened this year: the first outbreak - I'd venture the size of Birmingham's Royal Ballet - is well mannered in technique, with a style that speaks clearly of Kirov example. It looks, even in the merry nonsense of Nutcracker, coherent as an ensemble, unified in training. The production they bring is a bit of a muddle, but since this visit has been arranged at breakneck speed (the Ballet du Nord's defection was only six weeks ago) we can accept a somewhat routine air to the narrative, and be grateful for the central seriousness of the event. The production is by Nikolay Boyarchikov, a former director of the company, and is cursory in dramatics. Its fascination is that it incorporates much of the Nutcracker choreography made in 1934 by the eminent Leningrad ballet-master Vasily Vainonen. We have seen some of this before in Kirov performance, and its surely-made classicism argues the importance of Vainonen as a creator. What is new to us, and remarkable, is Vainonen's fashioning of the snowflakes' waltz. Bold in shape, driven and swirling through shifting patterns, the dance evokes not the gently drifting snowflakes we are used to, but a storm of Russian snow as it falls. I thought it beautiful in its sweep, and excellently done by a strong female corps. The company is lively in this, as in everything. Though the dramatic line of the first act is unconvincing, because Drosselmeyer is unclear as a motive force, the dancers are enthusiastic, and the thin 'look' of the production (Soviet-flimsy in Act 1; much more magical with the snow scene) must be excused because of the haste of this visit. The child heroine, Masha, was taken on Wednesday with real charm and, when transformed into the second act's ballerina, with brilliancy of means by Elena Kulagina. Vainonen's culminating gift to Masha is the great pas de deux, which he turns into a display of pyrotechnics by giving the ballerina five cavaliers who throw and catch her in bravura fashion. (It is a fascinating period piece in evoking the acrobatic manner favoured in Soviet ballet during the 1930s). Kulagina, gleaming, effortless, is a delightful exponent of its manner. Her chief cavalier, Vitaly Poleshchuk, is clean in style, elegant. The divertissements of the second act show that the Perm company has lively soloists: I hope we shall see them again in a more searching repertory. The score is recorded, and well-played by an excellent but un-named orchestra. As a most intriguing sidelight on Nutcracker, Derngate has brought over a small exhibition of designs for this ballet from the archives of the Bolshoi Theatre. Some 60 costume designs are on view, by Konstantin Korovin for the Bolshoi's 1919 production by Gorsky, and by Vladimir Dimitriev for Asaf Messerer's 1939 staging. They are fascinating, important. The Nutcracker at Derngate Theatre, Northampton, until December 11.</p>

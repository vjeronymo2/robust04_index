			<p>CSO   <F P=106> Article by Nina Sergelius </F>   [Editorial Report] According to an article on page 5 in  Helsinki HUFVUDSTADSBLADET by Nina Sergelius, authorities do not  see any immediate need to act against the rapid increase in  Helsinki street prostitution, but plan to monitor the situation  closely, especially with respect to sexually transmitted  diseases (STD) and AIDS. The Helsinki City Council asked the  police, social service and public health officials to comment on  the problem. One worrisome aspect they noted was the influx of  prostitutes from Russia and Estonia over the last few years. The  council accepted the argument from social workers that  criminalizing prostitution would make especially alien  prostitutes more reluctant to visit physicians, and that the  whole problem of prostitution could be more effectively dealt  with through "social policy measures."  <H5>  Reduction in Venereal Disease Cases </H5>   Despite the appearance of open prostitution -- something  which was virtually nonexistent in postwar Finland until the  current recession started in 1990 -- the STD incidence has  steadily decreased. Statistics from the National Health Public  Health Service, for example, show that registered gonorrhea  cases declined from 645 in 1990 to 141 in 1993, and chalmydia  cases from 2,150 in 1990 to 1,607 in 1993. What was remarkable  to the author, however, was that 54 percent of those diagnosed  with gonorrhea in 1993 had been infected abroad. The  corresponding figure for 1990 was 15 percent. Of those who had  been infected abroad, 39 percent had gotten the disease in  Russia and 37 percent in Estonia.    The incidence of AIDS is continuing to increase. At the end  of 1992 the HIV/AIDS treatment hospital in Helsinki had 180 HIV  positive patients. By the end of last year this figure had risen  to 211.    Given the inverse trend between Helsinki prostitution and  STD's, however, the Public Health Service joined other offices  in only adopting a policy of careful monitoring the situation.</p>

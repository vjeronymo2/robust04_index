			<p>BFN     [Text] Turkmenistan has introduced, starting with May, a  special commercial rate of exchange for its national currency,  the manat, at which banks will carry out transactions with  individuals.    The rate will be 60 manats per dollar, while the official  rate is 10 per dollar, and is expected to stay until further  notice by the Central Bank. Meanwhile, the street value of the  dollar in Ashkhabad is 90 to 95 manats.    All banks are allowed to buy hard currency at that  commercial  rate. The country's Vneshekonombank (foreign economic bank) and  the joint stock commercial bank Turkmenistan have a right to  exchange manats for dollars at this rate for Turkmenistan  citizens go abroad while the Investbank will sell hard currency  to individuals in cashless transactions to enable them to pay  for cargo transportation abroad. The banks will not handle  transactions with individuals involving more than 500 dlrs.    In mid-March the manat was devalued from 1.99 to 10 per  dollar. Simultaneously the government announced its intention to  introduce a floating rate of exchange which was to be dictated  by the prices at the country's inter-bank exchange. Following  the first trading on 14 March 1994, when the banks sold 150,000  dlrs at a rate of 10 manats the exchange was suspended and the  official rate stayed invariable despite the 30 percent monthly  inflation rate.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by M. V. Volkenshtein, I. B. Golovanov, I. G. </F> Tsygankova; Institute of Theoretical and Experimental Biophysics  of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Pushchino; UDC 577.112.6]    [Abstract] A relatively simple ``vacuum approximation''  method of conformational analysis and a method for estimating  the free energy of molecular transfer from the gaseous (organic)  to the aqueous phase were described and proposed as alternatives  to the traditional approach to simulating biopolymer molecular  structure. The rational for the simplified approach was based on  two equations derived from the thermodynamic cycles employed to  quantitatively express molecular structures and processes. These  equations can be used to estimate the free energies of these  processes in water. The simplified approach was used to simulate  the structure of molecules and molecular associations in the  aqueous phase, to simulate simple molecular systems and quantify  their hydrophobic interaction, and to simulate the structure of  hydrocarbon polymers and glycine and alanine oligopeptides in  the organic and aqueous phases. It was found that a polymer  molecule bends back under itself in water, forming a compact  structure and reducing the total molecular surface, leaving the  accessible surfaces of the polar groups located in the linear  sections unchanged while increasing the accessible surfaces of  the groups located where the molecule bends. This gives the  molecule an advantage by minimizing hydrophobic interaction and  by maximizing the hydration of the polar groups. Such behavior  is typical for any polymer, thus optimizing their ability to  interact with surrounding water molecules. This pattern is also  valid for peptides and proteins. The behavior of the glycine and  alanine peptides was found to be similar to one another in many  ways, with one notable exception involving a substantially lower  free energy contribution for the C7eq and _a_  conformers in the alanine, and consistent with existing  experimental data.

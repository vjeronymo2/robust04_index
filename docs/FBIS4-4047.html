			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Xu Lai (1776 0171): "China's Procuratorial </F> Organs Deal Sternly With Lawbreaking Procuratorial Personnel"]    [Text] Beijing, 26 Mar (FAZHI RIBAO)--This reporter has  learned from the second discipline inspection and supervision  work meeting held today that, last year, the procuratorial  organs across the country made great efforts to strengthen  anticorruption work within procuratorial organs, solemnly  handled a number of discipline violation cases, strictly banned  and corrected the unhealthy practices of indiscriminately  collecting fees and imposing fines, and quite successfully  safeguarded the prestige of procuratorial organs.    Wang Ke, head of the discipline inspection group sent to the  Supreme People's Procuratorate by the Central Discipline  Inspection Commission, gave an account at the meeting of  anticorruption work within procuratorial organs. Wang Ke said  that last year, a total of 12,934 leading cadres at or above the  department level of the procuratorial system across the country  took part in democratic life meetings which discussed honesty  and self-discipline. This accounted for 99 percent of leading  cadres who should have attended such meetings. Viewed from the  results of self-examination, most leading cadres have  strengthened their sense of honesty and self- discipline and  carried out self-examination and self-correction in accordance  with the five stipulations.    Wang Ke said that procuratorates at all levels handled cases  of violation of discipline, regarding this work as an important  task in anticorruption within procuratorial organs. Last year,  568 personnel who had broken laws and violated discipline were  put on record for investigation and prosecution, accounting for  3.3 per mill of the total number of procuratorial personnel  across the country. Of this number, 159 were punished for  violating party discipline, 343 for violating administrative  discipline, and 87 were investigated and affixed with criminal  responsibility. These included: The case of Chen Zhiwen,  former chief procurator of the Changping County Procuratorate in  Beijing Municipality, who accepted bribes amounting to nearly  20,000 yuan and the case of Cui Xingguo, former deputy chief  procurator of theinunchun City Procuratorate of Jilin Province,  who embezzled $4,000 from fines and money which had been  confiscated. At the same time, various localities also strictly  stopped and corrected the unhealthy practices of  indiscriminately collecting fees and imposing fines. According  to incomplete statistics, the procuratorial system sorted out 24  items of fees being indiscriminately collected and fines  indiscriminately imposed, involving over 16.29 million yuan.  Over 7.63 million yuan was returned to those who had paid and  over 1.17 million yuan was handed over to the state. By the end  of last year, 15 provinces (regions and municipalities) had  returned over 70 percent of such fees and fines to the payers.    Wang Ke said that since the Supreme People's Procuratorate  issued the "Notice Reaffirming Prohibition on Procuratorates  Overstepping Power or Violating Laws in Handling Cases" for the  second time last year, various localities have solemnly handled  this kind of case. Hebei Province, in cooperation with the  provincial discipline inspection commission, carried out  investigation and dealt with a discipline violation case in  which the Zhuozhou City Procuratorate meddled in 25 economic  disputes and kept 490,000 yuan in the course of demanding  payment of debts. The procuratorate has returned 277,000 yuan  from fees which it collected unlawfully. Zhang Weimin, chief  procurator, and Tian Fang, deputy chief procurator of the  procuratorate have been dismissed.    Talking about the major anticorruption tasks within  procuratorial organs this year, Wang Ke urged that all  procuratorial personnel should, centering closely round the new  demands of three items of work put forward by the central  authorities, in accordance with the unified planning of local  party committees, and in light of their own actual situation,  carry out thorough-going, sustained, and more effective  anticorruption work within procuratorial organs and strive to  make achievements in education, self-discipline, handling cases,  and improving rules and regulations.</p>

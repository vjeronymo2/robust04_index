			<p>BFN     [Text] MNP-28 [National Patriotic Movement of 28 November],  led by Dejean Belizaire, reacted to the threats of military  intervention in Haiti and the total embargo planned against  Haiti. Belizaire accuses the U.S. President of violating the  national sovereignty of the Republic of Haiti. The former  president of the National Assembly condemns the behavior of the  international community, which is trying, he says, to impose a  solution from the outside to a crisis that is above all,  Haitian. It is up to Haitians to solve the problems of power and  of the political regime in Haiti, stated Belizaire on this new  twist in the political crisis:    [Begin Belizaire recording] Haiti is an independent,  sovereign state, bound through mutual respect to cooperate with  the other states in the hemisphere and with the international  institutions. But it is up to Haitians and to Haitians alone to  solve the problems of power and political regimes in this  country. It is desirable under the exceptional circumstances of  this crisis, however, that the opposing parties understand that  in their search for a durable solution, they must be open to  mutual concessions or to pay an unavoidable price.    Second, the institution of democracy in Haiti, as is the  case  for all countries in the hemisphere, will be the product of the  economic, political, and social contradiction game, and of a  long process. But it cannot in any way be imposed from the  outside. The 19 years of U.S. military occupation, beginning in  1915, only broke the dynamic struggle of the Haitian people for  change, and interrupted the country's process of democratization.    Third, a total and complete embargo and military invasion as  a means of solving the Haitian crisis is a monumental, gross  mistake from which the international community must immediately  dissociate in order to safeguard its distinguished image and the  future of its relations with the Haitian people and with the  authentic political parties, the only ones that are permanent,  durable, and unfailingly attached to the fate of the sovereign  Republic of Haiti.

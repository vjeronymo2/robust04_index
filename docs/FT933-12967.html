			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Zurich slips 2 per cent on profit-taking A WEAK start on Wall Street was a contributory factor to losses on many of the late closing bourses, writes Our Markets Staff. ZURICH finally succumbed to a round of profit-taking after its recent strong run which left the SMI index down 57.9 or 2.4 per cent at 2,324.1, after a day's low of 2,317.3. The selling pressure built up in the absence of domestic buyers and with many foreign investors now turning their attention elsewhere. Mr Frederick Hasslauer, of Swiss Volksbank in Zurich, believes that the market could see a further downward correction of around 3 per cent in the next two weeks. 'The market has been strong since the start of the year, with a rise of 15 per cent since the beginning of May,' he said. 'On the back of that, a 5 per cent correction from the top of the market would be seen as a healthy sign from a chart point of view and by the market.' UBS bearers led the market lower, shedding SFr42 to SFr1,125, while selling by London investors left Nestle down SFr27 at SFr1,048. Roche certificates continued under pressure, dipping SFr110 to SFr4,895. Brown Boveri continued to buck the trend. A SFr18 rise to SFr857 was attributed to market rumours that a US broker had placed the shares on its buy list. FRANKFURT inched up to a new high in the official session, but lost it in the post-bourse as the Swiss market fell. The DAX index rose 2.70 to 1,838.99 before an Ibis-indicated 1,826.52 in the afternoon. Turnover eased from DM9.4bn to DM9.2bn. The worst casualties in the post bourse were, first, shares of which the market had cause to be wary and, secondly, those which had excited speculators and investors over recent days. Volkswagen saw the adverse ruling it feared in the Spiegel/Lopez case, incorporated Monday's post-bourse weakness to fall DM6.80 to DM351 on the session, and shed another DM4.50 to DM346.50 in the afternoon yesterday. Daimler fell DM13.50 overall to DM679.50. BASF gained DM3.40 on its Russian and gas pipeline initiatives, and then lost DM4.40 to DM260.50 in the afternoon; in utilities, improved sentiment in Viag, which itself put on DM4.70 to DM412.20, reflected on RWE, which gained DM6.70 to DM412.20; but RWE lost DM4.20 of that after hours. PARIS followed other bourses lower in the afternoon session after early trading had been lent some support by industrial production data which showed a 0.2 per cent rise in May against a 0.6 per cent decline a month earlier. The CAC-40 index closed off 13.26 at 1,968.44, after a high of 1,986 and a low of 1,964, in turnover estimated at some FFr2bn. BSN extended Monday's FFr15 fall as fears continued to develop that branded products mare likely to face aggressive competition from non-brands. The shares closed down FFr10 at FFr842. In the automotive sector Peugeot dropped FFr15 to FFr618 and Michelin FFr6.10 to FFr168.50; while Euro Disney picked up from its day's low of FFr56.90 as selling developed following the overnight close in New York of its parent, Walt Disney, which fell to a new 1993 low. Euro Disney finally closed off 20 centimes at FFr58.00. AMSTERDAM fell back sharply in late trading on technical selling and some profit-taking and the CBS Tendency index closed the day off 2.2 or 1.8 per cent at 117.2. Stocks which had made impressive movements on Monday slipped back, including Nedlloyd, down Fl 2.70 to Fl 39.10, after its 10 per cent gain the day before. Among other declines, Unilever lost Fl 5.50 to Fl 187.70, DSM Fl 2.20 to Fl 98.00 and Elsevier Fl 2.30 to Fl 135.50. KLM fell Fl 1.20 to Fl 32.20 and denied reports that merger talks with other European airlines had almost reached an agreement. After the close the airline said that it was to combine all flights to and from the US with Northwest Airlines, its US partner. MILAN drew strength from the strong performance of Fiat and Generali and the Comit index advanced 6.61 to 561.74. Rumours of an announcement before the end of the month on an asset sale or international accord helped Fiat L187 ahead to L6,948. Generali put on L331 to L40,200. Olivetti, L53 or 3 per cent higher at L1,818, remained in demand amid speculation that it will shortly break Sip's mobile telephone monopoly. Montedison, L65.70 or 11 per cent higher at L656.70, and Ferruzzi, L32.30 or 9 per cent ahead at L381.80, remained volatile after news of the death of the former ENI chairman, Mr Gabriele Cagliari. Montedison is involved in a judicial investigation over its involvement in Enimont, a former joint venture with ENI. STOCKHOLM remained strong, the Affarsvarlden general index putting on 3.60 to 1,155.70, in spite of further easing in Ericcson B shares, down SKr13 to SKr365.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- July 20                                            THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes             Open       10.30       11.00       12.00  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100     1234.73     1234.58     1235.17     1235.45 FT-SE Eurotrack 200     1284.71     1285.70     1285.20     1283.10  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes            13.00       14.00       15.00       Close  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100     1234.38     1231.94     1226.84     1224.85 FT-SE Eurotrack 200     1282.09     1282.33     1279.75     1275.46  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Jul 19    Jul 16    Jul 15    Jul 14    Jul 13  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1235.43   1234.37   1229.70   1237.14   1235.91 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1283.54   1281.68   1278.79   1283.38   1279.32  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  High/day: 100 - 1236.32; 200 - 1285.78 Low/day: 100 - 1224.51  200 - 1275.07.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

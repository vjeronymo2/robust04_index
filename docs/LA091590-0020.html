			<p><P> September 15, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> $3 MILLION IS ENOUGH FOR RICKEY HENDERSON  </P> <P> Rickey Henderson has decided to throw a temper tantrum because Lenny Dykstra  dares to approach him in salary.  </P> <P> Rickey says "he can't fill my shoes, what I do every year."  </P> <P> Might I remind him that as a New York Yankee, he was hitting .247 when he was  traded to Oakland.  </P> <P> He is an outstanding base stealer, period. I am reminded of another base  stealer, Maury Wills, who decided to use the media as an outlet for his tears,  and the Dodgers sent him to Montreal.  </P> <P> Henderson is a good ballplayer who ought to thank his lucky stars he gets $3  million a year.  </P> <P> EDWARD J. WHERITY  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

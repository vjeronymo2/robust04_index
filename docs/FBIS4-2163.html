			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 6 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice-Premier  and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said here today that China, as  a permanent member of the United Nations (UN) Security Council,  will do its best to strengthen the UN role in safeguarding peace  and promoting development.    It will, as always, together with the world community strive  to enhance international cooperation in the field of human  rights, said Qian at a meeting with Dr. Kurt Waldheim, former UN  secretary general and president of the UN Association of  Austria, here this afternoon.    Qian told Waldheim, also former federal president of  Austria,  that the Chinese Government has given consistent support to the  UN's efforts for promoting and protecting human rights and basic  freedom according to the UN Charter's aim and principles.    He said that China holds the "Universal Declaration on Human  Rights" approved by the UN in 1948 as the first international  document to systematically put forward specific premises for  respecting and protecting basic human rights. He added that the  declaration has exerted far-reaching influence on and played a  positive role in the development of international human rights  activities after the war.    Qian said the Chinese Government has time and again stated  that it will contribute to protecting human rights and basic  freedom by abiding by the "Universal Declaration on Human  Rights" and in accordance with stipulations related to  international documents on human rights formulated according to  the declaration.    He said that, as a member state of the UN Commission on  Human  Rights, China actively takes part in all UN activities on human  rights, including its involvement in drawing up and formulating  UN documents on human rights.    China has joined in drawing up the eight international  documents on human rights and respected the "Universal  Declaration on Human Rights", the "Teheran Declaration" and the  "Declaration on the Right to Development", he said.    Qian noted that China was actively involved in discussing  and  formulating the "Vienna Declaration and Program of Action"  approved by the World Meeting on Human Rights last year and has  made important contributions in this regard.    He said China is willing to cooperate internationally on the  human rights issue, adding that such cooperation should be based  on equality and mutual respect.    Meanwhile, he said, it is China's view that it cannot  politicize the human rights issue or regard it as a means for  political struggle and exerting political pressure, nor turn it  into a tool for interference in other countries' internal  affairs.    Waldheim, who visited China on four occasions as the UN  secretary general, said that he appreciated Qian's statement  that China is willing to conduct international cooperation in  the human rights field.    It is of vital importance to strengthen cooperation and  exchanges among countries in all the world, he said.    Waldheim and his party arrived here on Monday for a 10-day  visit to China at the invitation of the UN Association of China.    During his stay here, Waldheim delivered a speech on the  international situation at the headquarters of the host  association.</p>

			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Wellcome falls Pharmaceuticals group Wellcome fell heavily after rival SmithKline Beecham said it had received approval to sell its anti-shingles treatment in the US. The treatment, known as Famvir, is a direct competitor to Zovirax, Wellcome's biggest selling product. One analyst argued that the SmithKline approval had come earlier than expected and was a reminder that Zovirax would lose its patent in 1997. However, others said there was well documented evidence to show that drug sales actually improved with the arrival of a competitor and the fall was merely the result of profit-taking after a good run. Dr Jonathan Gelles of Wertheim Schroder said 'the number two player always expands the market' and that only 40 per cent of Zovirax sales in the US were for shingles and thus under threat of competition. There was also some encouraging news for Wellcome - it announced a co-promotion deal with Upjohn, of the US, for Zovirax - but the shares have risen sharply over the past few weeks and were easily marked down. They closed 27 weaker at 590p, with turnover uninspiring at only 1.3m shares. SmithKline 'A' picked up from a low of 404p to close 3 off at 406p. Life assurances bucked the overall market slide, with the sector given a boost by Hoare Govett, whose insurance team told clients to 'build weightings' in the sector. Hoare said that, in terms of yield relative, the sector is standing at an historic high, exceeding that of the composites. 'The UK life assurance industry has the potential for a prolonged period of sustained growth in excess of GDP,' the broker added. Prudential, steady at 287p, remains Hoare's 'nap' selection in the sector. High street retailer Kingfisher dusted off recent gloom and rose 9 to 499p after investment bank BZW changed its strongly negative stance on the stock by removing it from the sell list to tag it as a hold. Mr Tony Shiret at BZW said there was initial evidence of stabilisation in the DIY mar-ket which would help to steady margins. Storehouse firmed 2 to 217p following a visit by analysts to the company's BHS distribution centre. BPB, the plasterboard group, raced up 13 to 302p after preliminary profits that exceeded the most optimistic forecasts. UBS increased its current year profits forecast from Pounds 135m to Pounds 150m. Shares in Gestetner tumbled 19 to 144p, brushing aside favourable figures, after stake holder Inchcape said it would not exercise its convertible loan option to increase its 14.88 per cent stake in the office equipment group. Profit-taking in industrial group Charter saw the shares shed 15 to 699p. News of a 97.4 per cent take-up of its recent rights issue helped conglomerate Wassall advance 13 to 292p. Prospects of a Saudi Arabian order for GKN subsidiary Westland boosted GKN shares, which added 5 at 554p. Chesterton, the property agency which came to the market last week at 100p, gave a good performance yesterday, rising 5 to 107p. Universal Ceramic Materials, brought to the market at 86p, closed 2 ahead at 88p after its first day of dealings.</p>

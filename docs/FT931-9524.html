			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / Daf receivers make 1,635 redundant NEARLY a third of the UK workforce of Leyland Daf, the beleaguered commercial vehicle maker, were made redundant yesterday. A total of 1,635 employees lost their jobs at the company's five sites. The collapsed company's receivers warned that the rest of the workforce would also have to be laid off if components suppliers continued to frustrate attempts to restart production at the truck plant at Leyland, Lancashire and at the van plant in Birmingham. In a letter to the chief executives of some suppliers the receivers warned 'if we cannot restart production because we cannot get the co-operation of all key suppliers, the remaining workforce will be laid off. 'If this happens the prospects of the plants reopening are extremely bleak.' The receivers have failed to restart production since being called in early last week. Suppliers are unlikely to receive payment of outstanding bills but the receivers say orders for components placed since the collapse would be paid as an expense of receivership. Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, backed the call to suppliers to resume deliveries to Leyland Daf and said he hoped they would 'feel able to rely on this assurance' from the receivers that they were 'certain' to be paid. Mr John Allen, chief negotiator for the AEEU engineering and electrical union, said the unions feared yesterday's job cuts were not the end of the redundancies. The first job losses among the 5,500-strong workforce were met with bitter resignation and anger. A total of 997 hourly paid and 638 salaried employees were made redundant. The biggest cut was in Leyland, Lancashire, where 768 out of 2,114 jobs were cut. At the Leyland Daf Birmingham van plant 589 of the 1,960 jobs were shed, while 136 jobs were shed at the company's parts centre in Chorley, 75 jobs at the Thame, Oxfordshire sales and marketing operations and 67 jobs at the Albion axle plant in Glasgow. Mr Murdoch McKillop, joint administrative receiver, said the redundancies were 'necessary if we are to maintain the business and carry on trading as a viable operation'. The job cuts had been structured so as to 'maintain viable businesses at each plant'. The receivers were seeking 'to continue trading with a view to eventual sale of each business as a going concern'. Leyland Daf could neither pay its creditors from before its collapse nor meet contractual redundancy obligations, Mr McKillop said. Dismissed workers would receive only statutory redundancy payments. Mr Jim Thomas, national officer for the white-collar Manufacturing Science and Finance union, said the workers made redundant were paying 'a very personal price for the lack of government intervention'. Workers would receive only the state redundancy payment of one week's pay for every year of service. Production workers at the Leyland plant voted by four to one against taking strike action. National and local union officials will meet in Birmingham on Monday to discuss their next move in the campaign to save jobs at the company.</p>

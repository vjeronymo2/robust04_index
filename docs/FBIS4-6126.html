			<p>BFN     [Text] The U.S. Department of State has asked Japan to  suspend yen-based loans to Iran. Commenting on the request, a  Foreign Ministry source made it clear on 14 April that the  Japanese Government has no intention of suspending yen-based  loans and official development assistance (ODA) to Iran, at  least for the time being, adding that the "Japanese Government  has no hard evidence showing Iran as terrorist-supporting  nation." The same Foreign Ministry source also disclosed that  the Japanese Government sent Deputy Foreign Minister Hiroshi  Fukuda to Washington on 10 April to explain its position  regarding yen-based loans to Iran.    The Japanese Government decided last May to extend a total  of  150 billion yen in loans to finance Iran's construction of the  Godal Raldal [name as published] hydroelectric power plant; the  loans will be extended to Iran in three installments. A  contract has already been concluded between the two countries on  the first installment, totaling 38.6 billion yen. According to  a senior Foreign Ministry official: "A contract for the first  installment has already been concluded between Japan and Iran.  Japan cannot suspend yen-based loans to Iran halfway through a  contract. The second contract on turbine procurement is to be  concluded within this year."    The government decided to resume yen-based loans to Iran for  the first time in 17 years after concluding it is indispensable  to assist the Iranian Government's efforts to promote economic  reforms in order to bring peace and stability to the Gulf region  and stabilize relations between Iran and its neighboring nations.    However, the U.S. Department of State and the National  Security Council (NSC) have continued to put Iran under close  surveillance, claiming Iran has supported terrorist activities  on the basis of Islamic fundamentalism. Hence, the U.S.  Government will certainly continue to ask Japan to halt  yen-based loans to Iran.</p>

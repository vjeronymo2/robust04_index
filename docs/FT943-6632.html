			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Extra CGT liability I have a unit trust-linked life endowment policy and, thus far, have received yearly statements. These show the units held on the policy and the capital gains liability of the insurer, which would be deducted at maturity. I now have a statement showing that this tax has had to be paid and has been met by selling units. Also, I am told that, in future, capital gains will have to be paid yearly by sale of units but that no relief is available for carrying forward in bad years. As a consequence, it could be preferable to have the units transferred to my own name, as I might be better off by utilising my own capital gains annual tax allowance. I can do this; the policy has matured and I have extended the term but I can surrender at any time. Is there any personal tax liability on surrender, though? Presumably, the unit trust managers have to pay tax on their trading and this would be the same whoever holds the units, whether managers or the private owner. Thus, it is not clear to me why there is the additional capital gains liability on my yearly statement. Could you explain this? The way in which the surrender value of the policy is calculated depends upon how much discretion the insurance company has given itself in the terms of (1) the policy itself and (2) the extension - if that was not provided for in the original policy document. You should read the small print carefully and decide (i) if you think the company's calculations comply, in principle at least, with the terms set out in the small print and, if so, (ii) you consider that the salesman or the company's staff, or both, failed to make the potential cuts in the surrender/maturity value clear enough to you when first you were thinking of (a) taking out the policy and (b) extending it. Because of the Financial Services Act 1986, we cannot give investment advice. Consequently we cannot say if you should surrender the policy; nor whether, if you do decide to surrender it, you should take the surrender value in cash or by the transfer of units from the insurance company's portfolio. We take it, from the limited data, that it is a qualifying life policy. That being so, there should be no income tax liability upon its surrender. This is something which you should check with the company, since only it knows the full background facts and figures. Finally, perhaps we should say that you seem to be confusing corporation tax (on chargeable gains) with capital gains tax. The words 'capital gains' in your letter should read 'corporation tax'. If you do decide to surrender the policy, and to take the surrender value by the transfer of units from the company's portfolio, then you would face a capital gains liability only if you sold some or all of the units in a year in which your total chargeable gains exceeded the exempt amount (Pounds 5,800 for 1994-95), after taking into account indexation relief and any allowable losses.

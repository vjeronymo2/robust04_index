			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 25. Several commenters note that we proposed to require global ``mobile satellite services'' in proposed Section 25.143(b)(2)(ii) and domestic ``voice'' service in proposed Section 25.143(b)(2)(iii). Our expectation is that LEO system operators will have market incentives to offer more than merely voice services, but for purposes of consistency we will revise proposed Section 25.143(b)(2)(iii) to read ``mobile satellite services.'' Further, in the Joint Proposal, the parties agree that Big LEO systems should be capable of covering all fifty states, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. We will amend Section 25.143(b)(2)(iii) to reflect this coverage.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> b. Financial qualifications.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 26. In light of the enormous costs involved in constructing and launching a satellite system, we have always considered financial ability a significant factor in determining whether an applicant is qualified to hold a license. Historically, the Commission has fashioned financial requirements for satellite services on the basis of entry opportunities in the particular service being licensed. This stems from our repeated experience that licensees without sufficient available resources spend a significant amount of time attempting to raise the necessary financing and that those attempts often end unsuccessfully. <FOOTCITE>35</FOOTCITE>  Consequently, where a grant to an under-financed applicant may preclude a fully capitalized applicant from implementing its plans, and service to the public may be consequently delayed, we have required a stringent financial showing to ensure that the public interest would be served. <FOOTCITE>36</FOOTCITE>  We have required a less stringent financial showing where grant to an under-financed applicant will not prevent another from going forward. For example, we required only a detailed business plan in the radiodetermination satellite service, where all applicants could be accommodated and future entry was possible. <FOOTCITE>37</FOOTCITE>  In contrast, we required evidence of full, irrevocable financing in the domestic-fixed satellite service, where applications to implement space stations regularly exceed the number of available orbital locations for those satellites. <FOOTCITE>38</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 35 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See, e.g.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> National Exchange Satellite, Inc., 7 FCC Red 1990 (Com.

Bur., released Feb. 14, 1985) (domestic satellite licenses declared null and void for failure to begin implementation as required by license). In addition, Geostar Corporation, a start-up company licensed in the radiodetermination satellite service, declared bankruptcy nearly five years after its licenses were issued. It had not built any of its satellites.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 36 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> This approach has not prevented smaller firms from participating in the satellite services market because ownership of a space station is not mandatory. Space station capacity can be leased or bought, and earth stations can be acquired at relatively low costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 37 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Amendment to the Commission's Rules to Allocate Spectrum for, and to Establish Other Rules and Policies Pertaining to, a Radiodetermination Satellite Service, 104 FCC 2d 650 (1986) ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> RDSS Licensing Order <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> ).

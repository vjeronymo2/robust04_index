			<p><P> February 25, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FARWEST SAVINGS PRESIDENT, CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER FIRED  </P> <P> The president of FarWest Savings &amp; Loan has been fired for unspecified  reasons, and his chief financial officer has been dismissed for making  unauthorized investments, the attorney for the thrift's parent company said  Friday.  </P> <P> President Victor H. Indiek and Chief Financial Officer Robert D. Struck were  terminated Tuesday, said Kurt C. Kemper, general counsel for FarWest Financial  in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Operation of the Newport Beach-based S&amp;L was turned over, at least  temporarily, to Charles H. Green, chief financial officer of FarWest Financial.  </P> <P> "Mr. Struck was terminated for engaging in unauthorized investments," Kemper  said. "We have no reason to believe, however, that there is any loss as a  result of his actions."  </P> <P> He said Struck had moved about $85 million from government securities into  certificates of deposit at three large S&amp;Ls.  </P> <P> "Every bank and S&amp;L has strict policies about investing depositor funds,  and he violated those policies," Kemper said.  </P> <P> Struck declined to comment on the advice of his lawyer, Fred T. Ashley, who  also refused to comment. Indiek could not be reached.  </P> <P> Kemper would not comment on the reason for Indiek's dismissal.  </P> <P> Sources said that Indiek was dismissed because he was held accountable for  Struck's action.  </P> <P> Lawyers for FarWest and Indiek are negotiating a settlement of Indiek's  multi-year contract, Kemper said.  </P> <P> Indiek, who was hired in August, had been one of the chief financial officers  and one of six senior executive vice presidents at Financial Corp. of America,  the now-bankrupt Irvine firm that once owned American Savings &amp; Loan.  </P> <P> After taking the reins at FarWest Savings, Indiek hired some of his colleagues  from FCA/American, including Struck, who had left FCA in 1987.  </P></p>

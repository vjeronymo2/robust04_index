			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Government Action in United States"] </F>   [Excerpt] The Temelin nuclear power plant near the  Austrian border was the topic of a question hour in the  Nationalrat on Wednesday [2 February]. All parliamentary groups  called for preventing, if possible, the completion of the Czech  nuclear power plant in Temelin; the Greens called for more  activities by Austria. Chancellor Vranitzky stressed that  government members will present the Austrian position in the  United States.    Deputy Anschober of the Greens accused the government of  acting against Temelin only half-heartedly. He described the  special threat to Austria's security by the Temelin nuclear  power plant. Anschober sees definite chances to prevent the  completion of Temelin. In the Czech Republic rejection of the  nuclear power plant is growing and the financing by the United  States is hanging "on a silk thread." This is why Austria  should massively intervene in the last stage of decisionmaking  by the U.S. Congress on financial guarantees and environmental  compatibility. At the hearing by the U.S. Congress Banking  Committee, which is scheduled for 23 February, Austria should be  represented by the chancellor and an expert committee.    Chancellor Vranitzky stressed that Austria will "urge a  thorough and comprehensive examination of the project's  ecological compatibility." There are indications that approval  "would certainly not be a matter of course." At the government  level Finance Minister Ferdinand Lacina will discuss the matter  with his U.S. counterpart. Nationalrat President Heinz Fischer  will make use of parliamentary contacts in the United States.  There is no reason for discouragement or panic-mongering, nor  can "one speak of a lack of dedication at all."    The chancellor pointed out that the Austrian Government has  repeatedly expressed its concern about Temelin to the Czech  Republic. Also a paper on energy supply has been presented, and  it has been pointed out that the completion of Temelin as a  gas-steam power plant would be more sensible also from the  economic point of view. According to Vranitzky, a position  paper on Temelin, which was drawn up by the Chancellor's Office,  was sent both to the Eximbank as well as to the responsible  committee chairmen of the Senate and the House of  Representatives last September. In addition, last year Health  Minister Michael Ausserwinkler, who is responsible for radiation  protection, represented Austria's interests in the United States.    Generally, Vranitzky pointed to Austria's intensive  activities for years, involving the promotion of closing down,  alternatives, and reequipment of nuclear power plants both by  arguments as well as by industrial, technical, and financial  cooperation. He is aware of the fact that his concept of a  nuclear-power-plant-free Central Europe cannot be implemented  overnight, he said. However, Vranitzky expressed the conviction  that this is "more than the hobby of an Austrian head of  government; it is the defense of vital Austrian interests."  [passage omitted]</p>

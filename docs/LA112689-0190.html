			<p><P> November 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EXPERIENCING JIMI HENDRIX;  </P> <P> FOR TODAY'S BUDDING CROP OF BLACK ROCK MUSICIANS, HE'S MORE THAN A GUITAR HERO  -- HE'S A ROLE MODEL  </P> <P> Some sounds speak directly to the subconscious -- the blast of a cherry bomb,  the howl of a siren . . . the scream of Jimi Hendrix's feedback at the start of  "Foxy Lady."  </P> <P> If Jimi Hendrix were alive, he would be 47 on Monday. To mark the occasion, the  Black Rock Coalition -- a nonprofit organization formed to fight racism and  combat negative stereotypes in the music industry -- will present the first  "Jimi Hendrix Birthday Celebration" at the Music Machine in West Los Angeles at  8 p.m. on Monday.  </P> <P> In a field almost exclusively populated by white musicians, Hendrix has served  as a role model for a cadre of young black rockers. His achievement was to  reclaim title to a musical form pioneered by black innovators like Little  Richard and Chuck Berry in the 1950s.  </P> <P> For years, critics and musicians in pop circles have hailed Hendrix -- who died  on Sept. 18, 1970, as a result of inhalation of vomit due to barbiturate  intoxication -- as one of the most creative and influential rock guitarists  ever. But his impact on today's budding crop of black rock musicians runs even  deeper.  </P> <P> "I think of Hendrix in the same context as Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm  X," said Vernon Reid, guitarist for Living Colour and a founder of the Black  Rock Coalition.  </P> <P> "To me, he was one of the seminal black figures. Unfortunately, people get so  wrapped up in his guitar playing that they tend to overlook what he did with  sound and composition. Like Coltrane, Miles (Davis) and Ornette (Coleman),  Jimi's presence fundamentally changed the equation."  </P> <P> Lenny Kravitz, whose '60s-influenced solo debut album, "Let Love Rule," has  received kudos from critics and in college and alternative radio circles, cites  Hendrix as a crucial link in the development of black music.  </P> <P> "For Jimi radio airplay wasn't the premise," Kravitz said. "He didn't just  write hit songs or hooks. Back then rock music was about free expression and  Jimi was an innovative artist at the top of his form. People tend to forget  that rock 'n' roll is black music -- not just white people either. Black people  forget too. Hendrix opened the doors for guys like me. He is the perfect  example of a black artist doing what he wanted to do."  </P> <P> Billy Nelson, who plays bass for the BRC (Black Rock Coalition) All Stars, the  band that will open the Music Machine bill (local rockers Total Eclipse and  East Coast rappers Culture Shock are also scheduled), says it would be  impossible to overestimate  </P> <P> Hendrix's importance in the local black rock community.  </P> <P> "Hendrix did for rock what Charlie Parker did for jazz," Nelson said. "He was  like a modern-day Bach or Beethoven, a musical mastermind who came in and  completely changed the entire scene."  </P> <P> Proceeds from the Hendrix tribute will be used by the BRC to underwrite the  coalition's ongoing campaign to secure a star for Hendrix on the Hollywood  Boulevard Walk of Fame. Local BRC co-director Ray Jarvis says the coalition  chose to single out Hendrix's contribution because his music represents the  "essence of what the BRC is all about."  </P> <P> The BRC was established in 1985 by Vernon Reid, writer Gregg Tate and film  producer Konda Mason. Local directors MaryAlice Bailey, Norwood Fisher, Mason  and Jarvis opened the Los Angeles chapter in May.  </P> <P> "It's funny, this idea of treating black rock like it's a separate sub-genre of  rock," Reid said. "When a white band like AC/DC plays rock, they're actually  playing black music. Rock 'n' roll was created by black musicians."  </P> <P> Reid believes that Hendrix's race is central to his relevance.  </P> <P> "Who could listen to 'Machine Gun' without thinking about black soldiers in  Vietnam?" Reid asked. "It's because he was black that his version of 'The Star  Spangled Banner' is so powerful. It's too bad that Jimi was taken from us  before he could really explore the jazz direction."  </P> <P> BRC member Dr. Frank Gilliam, a professor in UCLA's political science  department, says one reason Hendrix is so revered is because his music helped  many middle-class black rock fans overcome a social identity crisis they  experienced during the late 1960s.  </P> <P> "Some of us in the BRC were raised in the suburbs, the first wave of black  working-class children," Gilliam said. "When we were growing up, rock was not  cool music for black kids to enjoy. Either you listened to 'soul' music or else  you were considered 'whitewashed.' "  </P> <P> According to Gilliam, Hendrix's music and his anti-war, pro-civil rights  political stance offered black teen-agers who loved rock 'n' roll a new ethnic  role model -- a black man internationally respected for modernizing black roots  music who was unafraid to experiment with Anglo-cultural influences.  </P> <P> "Jimi personified the 'transculturation' of America for middle-class blacks,"  Gilliam said. "He validated our position in society, the fact that we were  proud to be black, but also not enslaved by the black  </P> <P> experience."  </P> <P> Hendrix's penchant for loud, dissonant feedback altered the course of funk  music too. Many R&amp;B musicians who cut their teeth on James Brown and Sly  &amp; the Family Stone were stunned by the power of his eclecticism.  </P> <P> George Clinton, whose work has influenced black stars from Prince to De La  Soul, says Hendrix's psychedelic approach to the pentatonic scale not only  taught him to respect blues music, but also encouraged him to experiment in new  directions.  </P> <P> "Jimi was definitely the one we held up when we wanted to reach for something,"  Clinton said. "The way he could control feedback and make it sound so symphonic  truly transcended logic. There were no boundaries to his playing. One minute he  would sound like Curtis Mayfield, next thing he'd be doing Ravi Shankar. His  music gave me the freedom to go out and be anything I felt like being  musically."  </P> <P> Coalition members also consider Hendrix to be the first rock musician to  seriously explore atonal improvisation with amplified feedback and electronic  distortion. During the late 1960s, his efforts in this regard drew praise from  respected figures in the jazz community like Miles Davis and Gil Evans. In  Davis' 1989 autobiography, the trumpeter credits Hendrix with influencing his  shift toward a more rock-edged sound.  </P> <P> James Marshall Hendrix was born in Seattle on Nov. 27, 1942. Before bursting on  the pop scene as a headliner in 1967, he worked the chitlin circuit as a  sideman. Between 1963 and 1965, he toured with and/or performed session work  for many R&amp;B stars, including King Curtis, Ike &amp; Tina Turner, the Isley  Brothers, Jackie Wilson, James Brown, Solomon Burke and Little Richard.  </P> <P> Little Richard remembers Hendrix as a consummate showman who strongly resented  the racism he encountered in the music industry: "Jimi helped open up rock 'n'  roll to black music. He broke down the doors and burned up all the wood. He was  one big package."  </P> <P> Hendrix moved to England when he was 23 and began pioneering new musical genres  like metal and fusion before they even had names. Within a year of linking up  with drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding to form the Jimi Hendrix  Experience, Hendrix was cutting gold albums and selling out international  tours.  </P> <P> After that integrated power trio folded in 1969, Hendrix created the Band of  Gypsies with black musicians Buddy Miles (drums) and Billy Cox (bass) and began  to publicly support the political struggles of blacks, American Indians and  Vietnam veterans.  </P> <P> During his life, Hendrix's playing not only dazzled his fans and and peers, but  it also impressed many of the artists whose styles he emulated. During the  course of his career, he jammed with pioneers like Roland Kirk, B.B. King and  Muddy Waters.  </P> <P> Curtis Mayfield, whose influence on Hendrix is evident in compositions like  "Little Wing" and "Electric Ladyland," says that even though he had the  opportunity to play with Hendrix, he still stands in awe of the late  guitarist's abilities.  </P> <P> "Jimi's approach to music transcends racial barriers. His imagination spoke to  people on a deeper level than that," Mayfield said. "With the psychedelics and  what have you, he was almost like a scientist, studying the effects."  </P> <P> Although Hendrix released only five albums during his brief career, his legacy  lives on. In the 19 years since his death, six official compilations and more  than 400 bootleg records have appeared on the market.  </P> <P> Bob Merlis, head of publicity at Warner Bros. Records, says Hendrix is still  the label's most consistent seller. His original five albums have all reached  the 3 million sales mark. Nine albums have been digitally remastered and  reissued as CDs on Warner Bros./Reprise. "Smash Hits," a best-of collection  first released in 1969 and containing such classic Hendrix numbers as "Foxy  Lady" and "Purple Haze," was re-released early this month in CD, and comes  complete with a new high-tech graphics track that allows fans who own JVC's new  CD-plus-graphics unit to view synchronized psychedelic imagery while listening.  </P> <P> For serious fans, a musical transcription series called the Jimi Hendrix  Reference Library is also available in album-and-book packages from Hal Leonard  Publishing. The latest addition to the catalogue is called "Variations on a  Theme: 'Red House' -- Evolution of the Blues," featuring narration and singing  by blues legend and Hendrix fanatic John Lee Hooker.  </P> <P> Unlike other prominent music figures of the 1960s' anti-Establishment drug  culture, Hendrix seems to have little difficulty competing in today's  techno-synth market. Producer Alan Douglas, who runs Are You Experienced, the  Hollywood company that merchandises all official Hendrix estate music and  memorabilia, estimates that 75% of Hendrix's current audience is between 12 and  20 years of age.  </P> <P> "Jimi is no nostalgia figure," Douglas said. "He is still a relevant force in  rock. Kids today relate to his music as if he was still alive."  </P></p>

			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / Declining Indian deficits predicted India's budget deficit, which sharply exceeded its target in the last fiscal year, is on course for steady reduction over the next few years, Mr Manmohan Singh, finance minister, said yesterday. Mr Singh told a meeting of finance and business executives in London that last year's overshoot - to more than 7 per cent of gross domestic product, compared with a 4.7 per cent target - had been partly caused by unexpectedly low receipts from import duties. Customs duties account for about 40 per cent of government revenues. Cuts in import duty rates had not produced a sufficient rise in import volumes to compensate for the revenue lost. But Mr Singh expected revenues to bounce back this year. The budget deficit should drop by about 1 per cent of gross domestic product each year, bringing it down to 3 per cent in three to four years, he said. The rise in inflation, which has recently been nudging into double figures, was a temporary phenomenon, he said. The rate should drop back down when this year's crops come in. Economic growth should be at a minimum of 5 per cent this year and at much higher rates in the later half of the decade, he said. Mr Singh restated the government's commitment to reform of the economy, saying that 'any impression that we have lost our enthusiasm or slowed down would be erroneous'. By correctly sequencing reforms, he said, 'we have avoided the aberrations which have proved the undoing of the reform process in many other developing countries'. Meanwhile, a broad consensus of support for economic reform had developed throughout the country so that reform was now irreversible, he said. Although enough political support had not yet developed for full-scale privatisation, the government had opened up virtually all sectors to private competition, so the public sector's share of the economy was bound to shrink. Stefan Wagstyl adds from New Delhi: Prime Minister PV Narasimha Rao yesterday urged foreign companies to invest in India, saying: 'It is a free market now. There are no shackles anywhere. Invest in anything in India.' Mr Rao was speaking at a power industry conference, attended by Indian and foreign businessmen. It was his first meeting with a business audience since returning from a trip to the US, where investment promotion topped his agenda.</p>

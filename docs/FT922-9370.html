			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / Latvia introduces own rouble THE Baltic republic of Latvia yesterday introduced a parallel currency to the rouble to make up for a shortage of rouble banknotes to pay salaries. Mr Einars Repshe, chairman of the Latvian central bank, said he hoped Russia, which is giving republics a choice of staying in a rouble zone or setting up their own currencies, would not take retaliatory action. The so-called Latvian rouble, which has been printed in Latvia, would co-exist with the Soviet rouble, which Russia is now calling its own. 'From today all salaries and wages are being paid with it,' he said. Both currencies would be accepted in Latvian stores. But he said that to avoid swelling the money supply, Soviet roubles would be frozen in bank accounts and exchanged for new Latvian banknotes. The Soviet currency could only be bought by Latvian inhabitants wishing to purchase goods in the other former Soviet republics. Mr Repshe said the decision to introduce the new currency was not in reaction to a Russian ultimatum stating that only those republics that observed strict monetary, budgetary, and credit policies from July 1 could continue using the rouble as their currency. A Russian spokesman said the move could cause problems but admitted Moscow had no organised plan how to respond. Mr Repshe said that Latvia would be ready to issue its own proper currency, the lat, next year at the earliest. He said privatisation had to get under way and Latvian enterprises had to become more competitive. In the mean time, it would be prepared to join a tough financial policy with other republics that was 'civilised'. There are shortages of cash all over the former Soviet Union but because Russia controls the printing presses, it has some discretion as to where cash goes.</p>

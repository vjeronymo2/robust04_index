			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: Inchcape At first glance, Inchcape's acquisition of a stake in Gestetner looks a cheap and canny deal. Inchcape is limiting the risks of buying into a struggling photocopier distributor by staggering its investment. The immediate acquisition of 15 per cent of Gestetner's shares at a minimal premium buys it two seats on the board and access to management accounts. The purchase of the option to buy its entire convertible unsecured loan stock before 1994 gives it greater exposure if it likes what it sees. Inchcape is attracted to the recovery value which seemingly lies in a business making small profits on Pounds 900m of sales. But the vendor is clearly selling cheap for a reason. The softness of Gestetner's markets in mainland Europe suggests it will be a long, hard slog to return to respectable margins. Inchcape regards the investment as somewhat speculative; shareholders should perhaps do likewise. Some, though, may have misgivings about the change in strategic thrust should the Gestetner involvement develop significantly. Inchcape's primary attraction for many investors is its exposure to the blossoming southern Chinese economy. For them, at least, Gestetner may prove an unwelcome distraction.</p>

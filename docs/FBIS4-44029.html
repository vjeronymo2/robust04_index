			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jose Maria Brunet and Josep Gisbert: "Gonzalez </F> Assures Pujol on Economic Policy; Pujol Reaffirms Support for  Gonzalez"]    [Text] Madrid/Barcelona -- [Convergence and Union (CiU)  leader] Jordi Pujol stated yesterday evening that the support of  CiU for the government "is guaranteed if program agreements are  reached," after [Prime Minister] Felipe Gonzalez assured him  that the government will maintain its current economic policy  and its readiness to reach agreements in the autonomy sphere.  The two commitments mean the continuation of the cooperation  between the PSOE [Spanish Socialist Workers Party] and CiU,  which could take the form of program agreements when the 1995  budgets begin to be debated in September. Gonzalez and Pujol --  who met for over two hours at the Moncloa Palace, following the  former's return from Colombia yesterday and before the latter  leaves today for Indonesia on an official visit -- were in  agreement in rejecting the method of a confidence motion in  order to restore an image of stability to political life and on  the fact that the important thing is the support of a sufficient  parliamentary majority.    "The prime minister," Pujol said, "has asserted very  emphatically that he intends to continue the policy that has  been conducted so far, especially in the economic sphere. We  are in complete agreement on the country's needs right now and  on how matters must be directed. These months are very decisive  for the future for several years ahead, because the recovery is  beginning in Spain and in Europe, and we must take advantage of  it by adopting effective measures." Pujol, who paused for  several minutes on leaving the meeting, explained that he put it  to Gonzalez that for CiU "the important thing is for us to reach  agreement on certain aspects of a program nature," because for  CiU a pact on the economic and autonomy spheres is vital. With  respect to the former, it is "essential" that "support for the  productive economy" continue, and that measures can be adopted  to reduce unemployment.    For these aims to be achieved, there must be a  "parliamentary  majority" that will operate as such, and CiU will continue to  guarantee it as long as the program agreements last, Pujol  added. He specified that if they did not come about, "our  support would cease to exist." The premier cited as instances  the nationalist coalition's support for some of the most  important laws debated so far, as well as the fact that the  government is receptive to other proposals, such as the proposal  for the right to write-offs for the replacement of production  equipment, which is being approved by the cabinet today. Pujol  also stated that Gonzalez told him with "conviction" that,  although there are discordant voices, the PSOE is determined  that the policy conducted so far will continue.    With respect to autonomy matters, Pujol stressed that CiU's  demands are "advantageous" not just for Catalonia but for all  the autonomous communities, and specified that the Generalitat  has always proposed aims that lie within strict observance of  the statute [of autonomy] and that "can be accepted" by all the  parties and the public. The Generalitat premier went to the  meeting with the intention of succeeding in stabilizing the  political situation until September, in a desire to gain time  for the negotiation on autonomy with the government to take  place and for the outline of the 1995 budgets to begin to take  shape, and thus be able to support Gonzalez in a confidence  motion if he decided to submit one at that time.    The analysis that Pujol and the prime minister make with  respect to the messages of 12 June have many points of  agreement, and in view of this the most likely thing is that the  government will reach agreement with CiU on a parliamentary  strategy starting from September. Yesterday, two hypotheses  were being put forward: There could be a confidence motion on  the basis of a policy statement by the government, which CiU  would support, or the debate would be confined to the discussion  of the 1995 budgets. This option was the one that initially  aroused the greatest interest in the government, although the  impression has subsequently spread that CiU's support in the  budget debate would not be sufficient; rather, that a more  forceful and general expression of support for the government's  activity is needed, and this can only be achieved through a  confidence motion.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (c) The presolicitation notice will comply with the requirements set forth in (FAR) 48 CFR 5.207(b). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Include a statement that the solicitation will be released via the NABB, that potential offerors will be responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation, and that hard copies of the solicitation shall be made available on request, but the closing date will be the same as that required for the NABB released solicitation; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) State the projected solicitation release date, provide notice that it is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the NABB for solicitation release as the solicitation will be released as soon as permissible whether prior or subsequent to the projected date, and identify the name, telephone number, and e-mail address of a point of contact. The presolicitation notice shall be updated to reflect significant changes to the original notice. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> Subpart 1871.4_Request for Offer (RFO) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In MidRange procedures, solicitation of sources shall be accomplished by use of an RFO. The RFO will be solely a solicitation document incorporating only those elements of information required to solicit the offer. Offers will be provided on a model contract furnished with the RFO. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> 1871.401  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Types of RFO'S. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The RFO may be used for all types of procurements to which MidRange is applicable. The distinguishing difference will be the evaluation and award criteria specified in the RFO. This, in turn, will be driven by the buying team's decisions on the extent of discussion required, the amount of non-price factors that will influence the award and the amount of competition available. If the conditions in (FAR) 48 CFR 6.401(a) are met, the RFO's described in 1871.401&hyph;1 and 1871.401&hyph;2 shall be used; otherwise, RFO's described in 1871.401&hyph;3, 1871.401&hyph;4, or 1871.401&hyph;5 may be used. Once the evaluation and award criteria have been specified in the RFO, the procurement must conform to the procedures applicable to these criteria, unless changed by formal amendment to the RFO. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> 1871.401&hyph;1  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Sealed Offers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Policy.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> RFO's may specify that award will be made to the low, responsive, responsible offeror providing the most advantageous offer considering only price and price-related factors. This method shall be used when (1) time permits the solicitation, submission, and evaluation of sealed offers; (2) award will be made on the basis of price and other price-related factors; (3) conducting discussions with the offerors is not necessary; and (4) a reasonable expectation of receiving more that one offer exists. The RFO shall be in compliance with the requirements of (FAR) 48 CFR part 14 relating to Sealed Bidding. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Procedures.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) The RFO shall request offerors to provide both a technical and price offer by the closing date specified. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) In accordance with (FAR) 48 CFR Part 14, offers (whether received by facsimile or sealed envelope delivery) shall be publicly opened at the designated time and place. Interested members of the public will be permitted to attend the opening. Offers shall be abstracted pursuant to (FAR) 48 CFR part 14 and be available for public inspection. For unclassified acquisitions, a summary abstract, containing offerors, prices and any essential information specific to that procurement shall be posted on the NABB. The abstract shall be included in the contract file. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) All offers shall be examined for mistakes in accordance with (FAR) 48 CFR 14.406. The buying team shall determine that a prospective contractor is responsible and that the prices offered are reasonable (see (FAR) 48 CFR 14.407&hyph;2). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) The Government will award a contract to the low, responsive, responsible offeror, whose offer conforms to the RFO and will be most advantageous to the Government, considering only price and the price-related factors included in the solicitation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / Sharp rise in US trade deficit OFFICIAL figures showing a sharp rise in the US merchandise trade deficit in April provided an early warning yesterday of possible adverse trade trends later this year, if the US economy continues to revive and demand remains subdued elsewhere. The deficit jumped from Dollars 5.4bn in March to Dollars 7bn, the greatest shortfall for 17 months, the Commerce Department said. The unexpected deterioration reflected the combined impact of a jump in imports and a fall in exports. Wall Street analysts were taken by surprise, having forecast a deficit of about Dollars 5.7bn. The deterioration in April, however, overstates the rate at which the deficit is widening. For the first four months of the year, the deficit grew modestly - to Dollars 21.6bn compared with Dollars 20.8bn last year. Exports were up 6.5 per cent relative to last year. Separate figures yesterday for weekly unemployment insurance claims indicated continuing softness in US labour markets. Claims fell 2,000 in the week ending June 6 to 407,000. A significant improvement in job prospects is not expected so long as the claimant total remains stubbornly above 400,000.</p>

			<p>931004 FT  04 OCT 93 / Foreign Exchange and Money Markets: Focus on US AN IMPORTANT event on the foreign exchanges this week will be the release on Friday of US employment data for September. Dealers are anticipating a positive set of non-farm payroll figures, their hopes boosted by the results of the Chicago purchasing managers index last week. This showed a sharp jump in the employment component of the index. Last month the dollar was damaged by a 39,000 fall in non-farm payrolls, but technical factors, together with the rebound from August, should lead to a substantial rise in the September figure. The median forecast from economists is for a 150,000 rise. A good figure might tilt sentiment in favour of the dollar. Some economic data at the end of last week did not live up to expectations and proved insufficient to correct the view that the US recovery is disappointing. In Germany, Mr Hans Tietmeyer takes over as president of the Bundesbank. He inherits a more favourable inflationary background, but does not appear inclined to accelerate the central bank's gradualist approach to rate cuts. Sterling is unlikely to make many advances this week as the ruling Conservative party meets in Blackpool for its annual party conference. Although many dealers are sceptical that the government will use the conference as the background for a rate cut, investors remain cautious. However, as analysts at Barclays de Zoete Wedd point out, last year sterling stood at DM2.43 on the last day of the Labour party conference but a week later, at the end of the Tory gathering, was at DM2.52. 'It may be too much to expect an exact repeat this year, but such a comparison does illustrate how dangerous it can be to short sterling when it is obviously cheap relative to its purchasing power parity.'</p>

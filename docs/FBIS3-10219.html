Stalling maneuvers and deceptive promises can only ruin  the credibility of those involved in this crisis, stated the  president-in-exile, who asserted that the international  community cannot be neutral and that it is necessary for the  Army and Police hierarchy to step down without delay --  immediately and at once, he said.    Father Aristide did not refer directly to the latest  discussions held in the UN Security Council to try to impose  implementation of the Governors Island agreement through  sanctions against the military regime in Haiti. According to  Jean-Bernard Merimee of France, current Security Council  president, a draft resolution in this connection should be sent  to the Council by the end of the week.    Observers think President Aristide's statements before the  commission constitute indirect and harsh criticism of the new  plan supported by Washington, a plan which does not propose a  date for the return of the president-in-exile to his country.  During a speech before the commission, Father Aristide pointed  out the bloodthirsty, ferocious, barbarous nature of the current  dictatorship in Haiti, enumerating a long list of violations  committed by General Raoul Cedras' regime.    Aristide said: Today, the genocide continues in the presence  of the international community. What about the primacy of the  law? -- he asked commission member-countries, while affirming  that everyone should shoulder his responsibilities.</p>

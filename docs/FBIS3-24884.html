			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Monrovia, 3 Feb (AFP) -- The Liberian Interim  Government called on Wednesday for an "urgent" meeting of West  African countries to discuss the situation in Liberia and the  peace process which is entering a critical stage.    In a statement issued in Monrovia, the government said a  meeting of the Economic Community of West African States  (ECOWAS) was "necessary to review the implementation of the most  critical phase of the peace process - the commencement of  disarmament and the seating of the transitional government".    The disarming process initially due to start in August was  postponed and has still not begun despite the arrival of 364 UN  military observers and 1,600 Tanzanian and Ugandan soldiers sent  to reinforce the Nigerian-led ECOMOG [ECOWAS Cease-Fire  Monitoring Group] peace force. Under an agreement signed on  July 25 last year between the various Liberian factions, the  ECOMOG force mandated by ECOWAS will be responsible for  disarming the belligerents under UN supervision. Sierra Leone  and Ghana have already called for an ECOWAS meeting to discuss  Liberia. On Tuesday Sierra Leonean Foreign Minister Abass Bundu  criticised the "slow pace of the disarmament process".</p>

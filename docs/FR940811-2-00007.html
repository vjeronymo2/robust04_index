Explanation.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This standard, by adoption of ANSI/TIA/EIA&hyph;606&hyph;1993, Administration Standard for the Telecommunications Infrastructure of Commercial Buildings, specifies the administrative requirements of the telecommunications infrastructure within a new, existing, or renovated office building or campus. Telecommunications infrastructure can be thought of as the collection of those components (telecommunications equipment spaces, cable pathways, grounding, wiring, and termination hardware) that provide the basic support for the distribution of all information within a building or campus. Administration of telecommunications includes documentation (recordkeeping, drawings, labeling, etc.) of telecommunications outlet boxes, connectors, cables, termination hardware, patching and cross-connect facilities, conduits, other cable pathways, telecommunications closets, and other spaces. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Note:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Development of ANSI/TIA/EIA&hyph;606&hyph;1993, which included Federal Government participation, was a joint Canadian/U.S. effort, resulting in the Canadian Standards Association (CSA) publication of the Canadian equivalent of the U.S. standard as CSA T528 at approximately the same time as publication of the American National Standard. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 4.

Objectives.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The purpose of this standard is to facilitate interoperability and transportability among telecommunication facilities and systems of the Federal Government and compatibility of these facilities and systems at the computer-communications interface with data processing equipment (systems) of the Federal Government. This standard specifies a uniform telecommunications infrastructure administration scheme that is independent of applications, which may change several times throughout the life of a building. This standard establishes guidelines for end users, manufacturers, consultants, contractors, designers, installers, and facility administrators involved in the administration of telecommunications infrastructure. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 8. Applicability.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This standard shall be used by all departments and agencies of the Federal Government in the administration of the telecommunications infrastructure for all new office buildings. Use of the FIPS is recommended for the administration of the telecommunications infrastructure within an existing or renovated office building or campus. Existing building wiring systems, especially those installed prior to the emergence of digital communications and voice/data integration, may not readily accept application of this standard. Modernization of the existing pathway, space, and wiring systems to meet the FIPS 174, FIPS 175, and FIPS 176 infrastructure standards may require a significant monetary expenditures. Agencies should conduct a thorough facility analysis of existing and renovated buildings to determine the cost of applying the standards, and develop a migration plan where cost savings can be achieved. This plan will help to ensure timely and efficient completion of the conversion process. The result of following this administration standard will be a telecommunications infrastructure that is well documented and easily managed by the administrator over the life cycle of the building. This standard is not intended to hasten the obsolescence of telecommunications administration procedures currently in use in Federal facilities; nor is it intended to provide systems engineering or applications guidelines. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / Three unions 'live beyond means' Three unions are living substantially beyond their means and one has virtually no assets, the latest published accounts in the 1993 report of the certification officer for trade unions and employer organisations. The three were Ucatt, the construction union, the RMT transport and rail union, and the GPMU print union. Ucatt had total expenditure of Pounds 7.4m and income of Pounds 5.4m but net assets of only about Pounds 400,000. The RMT had expenditure of Pounds 13.7m and income of Pounds 10.5m but a healthier asset base of Pounds 15.3m. The GPMU had the biggest shortfall between spending of Pounds 35.5m and income of Pounds 29.4m but recorded one of the biggest asset bases of any trade union at just over Pounds 72m.</p>

			<p>920113 FT  13 JAN 92 / The FT European Top 500 (18): Picture is almost universally negative - Engineering / The financial effect of the downturn is hard to gauge, as so much of the industry remains in private hands IT HAS been a tough year for the European engineering industry, with a deep recession that began in the UK in the middle of last year spreading gradually to the continent, reaching Germany - albeit with reduced vigour - by spring this year. The downturn in western European demand has combined with a much-needed sense of realism about the long-term needs for capital goods in reunified Germany and eastern Europe, choking off some of the initial euphoria. The financial effect of the downturn on European engineering is hard to gauge, as so much of the industry remains in private hands. Inevitably, therefore, important but predominantly private industries such as machine tools, which by this summer were having a hard time virtually everywhere in Europe, and construction equipment, which is being buoyed by German demand, have little impact on the FT500. Nevertheless, the big publicly-quoted steel, metals and engineering companies that are in the index do give a reasonable indication of investor perceptions across a broad cross-section of industry, and the picture presented is almost universally negative. Virtually all such companies saw their position in the rankings slip this year. At the top end Siemens, with its significant transportation and power generating equipment interests, slipped from seventh to ninth, while ABB Asea Brown Boveri, the Swiss-Swedish engineering group, dropped from 16th to 31st. Further down the list, it is the same story, with solid engineering names such as Linde, Sandvik, Siebe, TI Group and Sulzer all registering declines of varying intensity. One of the most famous names in UK engineering, Vickers, only just managed to stay in the rankings, dropping from 432nd to 499th, having warned towards the end of September that its final dividend depended on an improvement in outlook for Rolls-Royce motor cars. There are some notable departures, most of which were pushed out by non-engineering companies rather than by the more honourable exit route via acquisition. The biggest takeover in the engineering industry this year saw the absorption of Alfa-Laval, the Swedish food, dairy and industrial equipment producer ranked 185th last year, by Tetra Pak, the privately-owned packaging company. Among eight further names to have dropped out are Klockner-Humboldt-Deutz (414th last year), which is expecting flat profits this year, Dowty (459th), the UK aerospace and electronics group caught up in the defence downturn, and FAG Kugelfischer (460th), the German bearings group. The one entrant to the rankings, at 220th, is Pechiney International, a recently-established, separately-quoted subsidiary of Pechiney, the French state-controlled aluminium and packaging group which retains a 75 per cent stake. It comprises most of the group's foreign activities, including American National Can. It should be pointed out that there are structural as well as cyclical reasons for the general decline, along with the shortage of new entrants. In the engineering industry, this has not been a big year for the kind of mega-merger activity which would have an impact on the FT500. The restructuring in mechanical and electrical engineering at the end of the 1980s was not only prompted by overcapacity in many important sectors, but by the closely-linked desire by companies to get mergers out of the way, and new structures in place, well ahead of the 1992 European Community Single Market reforms. There is, however, a reasonable amount of takeover and joint venture activity of the kind that by definition impinges on the FT500 rankings slowly or indirectly. However, the Gulf war caused as much uncertainty over long-term planning in the engineering industry as elsewhere. It is also important to note that, although the declines in rankings are pervasive, business conditions and prospects vary widely. The gloomiest sector is almost certainly the steel industry, where the three big publicly-quoted producers, Thyssen, British Steel and Hoesch, all suffered sharp falls in their European 500 positions. In spite of a decade of restructuring, a majority of European steel plants are either making losses or just breaking even, according to a confidential survey prepared for the European Commission this summer. Prices have been cut as national markets such as the UK, hitherto the preserve of British Steel, have become more open to foreign competition. As it happens, this survey of the industry's costs put both British Steel and Thyssen in a low-cost group, with Hoesch and its recent suitor Fried. Krupp in the medium-cost group. A stock market quotation has clearly spurred British Steel to increase efficiency, but its financial health, and perhaps its European 500 ranking - down from 84th to 105th this year - might improve with further thorough restructuring among its German rivals. Indeed next year's rankings could reflect that, if Krupp completes a planned merger with Hoesch which would create a new power in the steel and engineering industries. Krupp is not publicly-quoted. Elsewhere, the slip down the rankings by leading engineering groups has almost certainly been checked by the cushioning effect of their varying internal business cycles. ABB, for example, has been stressing all year the disparity between such 'standard products' as electrical installation equipment for housing, which have been hit by recession, and infrastructural businesses such as power generating equipment which is much more influenced by longer-term buying trends. As for machinery companies, the outlook may not look too bright, but one of the more thoughtful observers of the European capital goods scene, Mr Edward Hadas of Morgan Stanley, believes the future looks much better for selected companies if they can benefit from a virtuous circle of low production costs accompanied by higher product prices, while superior quality leads to increased market share. 'After many years of struggle, an increasing number of companies in Europe find themselves going round the first turns of this happy curve,' he says. Furthermore, he says, the impact of eastern Europe on the machinery industry should be more significant than for the western European economy as a whole, and come quite soon. Among quoted companies, he believes the best beneficiary of the forthcoming upturn will be Mannesmann - down in this year's rankings from 68th to 91st - partly because of leadership in several key machinery sectors.</p>

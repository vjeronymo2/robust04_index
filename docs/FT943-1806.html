			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / Observer: Light reading Calling all insomniacs. Michael Portillo, who as UK employment secretary is widely regarded as the rightwing pretender to John Major's crown, is bringing out a booklet of his speeches and interviews. The aim is to establish clear blue water between the Tories and Labour. As such it must be judged a qualified success, for what the work principally seems to highlight is a veritable ocean between Portillo and Major - with the cabinet minister ruling out the single European currency and so on. We are promised that 'these are by no means the last words from Michael Portillo'. No wonder John Major prefers a game of cricket in South Africa when his own cabinet is still bowling him such googlies.</p>

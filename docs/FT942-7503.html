			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / UK Company News: TeleWest takes on Pounds 195m debt for Scottish cable networks TeleWest Communications, the largest cable television operator in the UK, has borrowed Pounds 195m to complete its Scottish cable networks. The eight franchises in the central belt of Scotland cover 632,000 homes ranging from Edinburgh and Perth to Dundee, Motherwell and Livingston. The loan facility, which matures in December 2003, was arranged by Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and is underwritten by CIBC, Bank of New York, The Bank of Nova Scotia, British Linen Bank, First National Bank of Boston and The Toronto Dominion Bank. The loan is structured in two tranches, one of which has recourse to TeleWest's shareholders, Tele-Communications and US West. TeleWest said Edinburgh was one of its best franchises for both television and telephone services. The other Scottish franchises were bought from Post Newsweek late last year. TeleWest has announced its intention to float on both the London Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq market in the US later this summer. The float will be the first by a UK cable group and is likely to value the company at about Pounds 1.7bn. TeleWest owns and operates 16 cable franchises and has minority interests in three other companies which operate seven further franchises.</p>

			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / People: Chambre picked for Bespak Bob King is stepping down in the spring as chief executive of Bespak, the medical equipment manufacturer, as he will reach the company's retirement age of 65 in June. But he will be staying on as a fairly active chairman, assisting Peter Chambre, 38, the newly-appointed chief executive. King says the company looked at a number of candidates to replace him, using the services of headhunter Norman Broadbent, but that Chambre 'was the unanimous choice of the board. There comes a time when it's appropriate to take more of a back seat. 'We have some current problems, particularly in the US, so we needed someone who will make sure the business is looked after well,' says King. Last December the company announced first-half profits down by 43 per cent at Pounds 2.88m, thanks largely to uncertainty in the US healthcare market. Bespak relies on one US company, US Surgical Corporation, for 23 per cent of its sales. Chambre started his career in sales with Cadbury Schweppes, spending two years there before moving on to a five-year stint in various brand management roles with Unilever. He worked for Bain &amp; Co for a further five years, then on to Cope Allman Packaging and, most recently, with Caradon.</p>

			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / Island ferry link cleared by MMC labelled the world's most expensive route by aggrieved islanders - were yesterday cleared by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission of acting against the public interest, Richard Tomkins writes. The commission concluded after an eight-month study that Wightlink, the biggest Isle of Wight ferry operator, enjoyed a technical monopoly on services to and from the UK mainland, but cleared it of abusing its position. Isle of Wight County Council said it was disappointed. It had hoped that the commission would force Wightlink to give up at least one of its three routes to a competitor. Wightlink, a subsidiary of the Bermuda-based Sea Containers, is the biggest of four operators on Isle of Wight routes. The others are Red Funnel, a subsidiary of Associated British Ports, and two independents: Hovertravel and Cowes Express. The MMC says Wightlink carries 71 per cent of ferry passengers, 85 per cent of cars, 80 per cent of lorries and 94 per cent of coaches. Its profits are put at about 12 per cent of the replacement costs of its assets. Cross-Solent Ferries. Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Cmnd 1825. HMSO. Pounds 13.55.</p>

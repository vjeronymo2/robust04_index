			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Treaty that may spark a Dutch exodus - Netherlands investors face a tax threat THE 'half-Dutch' sandwich is going stale; the heady 'mixers' are losing their fizz. Some of the favourite nourishments in the cupboard of the tax practitioner are under threat as the process of ratifying a new US-Dutch tax treaty gathers speed. The lower house of the Dutch parliament earlier this month approved the treaty; the upper house will consider it shortly. So too will the Senate foreign relations committee in Washington DC. Any day an interpretation of the treaty for senators will be circulated by the US Treasury. Many British companies will be among those watching the details closely. 'Everybody you speak to now is very nervous,' says Mr Bruce Lassman, head of the US tax desk at accountants Ernst &amp; Young in London. 'A large number of companies may be restructuring after this year.' Those businesses ceasing to be eligible under the revised treaty will face increases in US withholding taxes on dividends from 5 per cent to 30 per cent, and on interest payments from zero to 30 per cent. The new arrangements are likely to threaten many UK companies which use Dutch holding companies as what tax advisers call 'mixers'. They reduce tax payments by offseting tax liabilities from operations in high-tax and low-tax countries before repatriating it to the UK, since British tax law does not allow this to take place onshore. They will be particularly affected by provisions in a protocol agreed last month between the two governments on Swiss branches of Dutch companies, which are used for financing. It permits the US to impose a 15 per cent withholding tax unless income from Swiss branches is taxed at more than 17.5 per cent. Currently, finance companies in Switzerland pay only 4 per cent tax on the income remitted to a Netherlands company, which can then be repatriated to the UK without any further tax being levied. Among other companies and individuals affected by the treaty will be those who have invested in the US through Dutch companies because they have no tax treaty of their own, such as those from Hong Kong, the Middle East, South Africa and Latin America. They have typically invested in the US via a Dutch company, in turn owned by a Netherlands Antilles company - an arrangement known as a half-Dutch sandwich. If they invested directly, the US would levy a 30 per cent withholding tax. The US-Dutch tax treaty reduces that to 5 per cent, and a Dutch-Antilles arrangement levies just a further 5 per cent, saving them 20 per cent. The significance of the Netherlands to the international tax industry is undeniable. Every year, the country emerges as the third largest investor in the US, closely behind its much bigger competitors, Japan and Britain. For a country the size of the US state of Maryland, that would be quite a feat - except that it includes substantial investments through Dutch subsidiaries as well as indigenous Dutch companies. The Netherlands' attraction as a springboard for activities in the US stems from its 1948 double taxation treaty with the United States, which is among the oldest still in effect between the world's industrialised countries. Dutch readiness to forgo taxes on profits, royalties and interest generated outside the country has attracted many foreign companies. Now this position is under threat. The treaty has long been a thorn in the side of US tax authorities, who have spent the last 11 years negotiating a new document with their Dutch counterparts. The result was initially signed just before Christmas last year. The indications are that both the Dutch and the US are keen to press ahead rapidly with ratification, partly reflecting the tougher line on foreign corporations voiced by President Clinton. If both governments approve the treaty by December 1 this year, it could be in force by January 1 1995. The original 100-page treaty and the related documents released since are highly complex. 'The question is whether it is twice as long as the next longest treaty,' says Mr Lassman. Under the existing treaty, companies merely had to be registered in the Netherlands to be eligible. Now they will have to meet stringent tests to prove that they are economically 'rooted' in the country. That means financing subsidiaries and mailbox companies will almost certainly be stripped of their benefits. In general, to remain under the terms of the new treaty companies will have to show that they are rooted in the Netherlands through one of four principal justifications: Ownership. The company must be 30 per cent Dutch owned. Active trader. It must be a significant trader, through a test such as being at least a tenth the size of the US business by an average of assets, gross income and payroll. Headquarters. It must demonstrate a substantial portion of the overall supervision and administration of the group, have discretionary authority to take decisions or have subsidiaries in at least five countries, each contributing at least 10 per cent of gross income. Ruling. If it meets none of these tests, the company can still appeal for a discretionary ruling if it can argue that it was created to obtain benefits allowed under the treaty. One way for UK companies to remain within the bounds of the treaty is to reorganise or restructure by 1995. 'It might seem a long time, but for an entire reorganisation it's actually quite short,' says Mr Andre Boekhoudt, a tax partner at KPMG Meijburg. Possible options for UK companies would be to transfer more staff or assets to the Netherlands, to seek a Stock Exchange listing for their Dutch-based sub-holding or to acquire industrial or business activities in the Netherlands and embed them in the existing company. Mr Lassman says a number of companies have talked about relocating in Ireland, but that this has little benefit for UK companies. He hears many others talking about obtaining approval for their existing structures by the Internal Revenue Service in the US - which cannot take place until after ratification. Mr Nicholas Dee, tax director of SmithKline Beecham, views the new treaty bleakly, even though his Dutch 'mixer' companies do not exploit the existing treaty with the US. 'It is part of a wider trend of the US attitude to international tax,' he says. 'If they override these treaties, there is a real risk of double taxation. Our concern is that this is an example of US imperialism.' The effects are not all negative. Dutch companies may face some extra red tape in establishing their right to invoke the treaty in the first place. But the US has thrown out at least one important concession in appeasement. Dutch pension funds may be able to receive dividend and interest income with no withholding tax, against 5 per cent at present. ABP, the big Dutch civil servants' pension fund, said the treaty 'could certainly be beneficial for us', but stressed it was still trying to understand the details. For the Dutch economy, the implications are less clear cut. Lawyers, accountants, banks and trust companies have done a lively business in advising foreign companies on how to use the Netherlands as a tax-efficient base. In the short-term, that activity is likely to increase as companies seek advice in untangling the implications of the new treaty. In the long-term, many will remain because of the Netherlands' extensive network of double-taxation treaties. But there may well also be an exodus of clients.</p>

"The Vatican must sever its so-called diplomatic relations  with Taiwan, recognize (that) the government of the People's  Republic of China is the sole legal government of China and  Taiwan is part of Chinese territory," a Foreign Ministry  spokesman said.    Beijing requires all countries with whom it has diplomatic  relations to recognize it as the sole government of all China.  It views Taiwan, the island to which defeated nationalist  forces retreated after the civil war, as an outlaw province.    The Holy See "must also stop interfering in China's internal  affairs, including its religious affairs," the spokesman said,  referring to unofficial Chinese congregations gathering for  worship.    "This is (a) matter of principle which should be solved in  the first place in Sino-Vatican relations," he said.    The pope expressed hopes on Monday to visit China. It was  the  second time in less than a year that he has voiced such an  ambition.    He said he did not want to forego a chance to build  relations  with Beijing and the state-sanctioned church, which is dependent  on the communist party. But he added that much needed to be  done ahead of establishing full diplomatic relations.    After the Chinese communists came to power in 1949, Beijing  and the Vatican severed ties and the Holy See recognized Taiwan.    The Chinese government has created an official church but  many among the country's Catholic population remain loyal to the  pope, gathering in groups in a so-called "church of silence"  supported by the Vatican.</p>

			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / No need to lose our heads There is no need to panic. Britain is not in the grip of the spirit of evil, although a casual visitor, picking up a paper at the airport, might be forgiven for thinking so. Law and order has not broken down, although the prime minister and the home secretary are beginning to speak as if it has. In most places, most of the time, the streets are safe, although anecdotal evidence suggests that they are not. We are in no danger of being torn to pieces by marauding gangs of child criminals, led by new Lords of the Flies, although that is what is intimated by some of the responses to last week's tragic murder in Bootle, Liverpool, of two-year-old James Bulger and the subsequent, shocking arrests of two 10-year-old boys charged with the crime. As to the latter case, much is surmised, but little is known. A prosecutor's account of what happened may not be available before March 3, when the boys are next due to be brought before the court. Meanwhile, there is no indication that the horrific abduction and murder of which they have been accused is part of a general pattern. To say or imply, as many have, that this dreadful event is symptomatic of what is wrong with British society is cheap and easy, but almost certainly wrong. Television pictures of two boys leading their tiny victim out of a shopping precinct have aroused strong emotions in most of us. They have also given a new, and unfortunate, impetus to the knee-jerk Right in its approach to all juvenile crime. To be sure, whoever killed baby James should be locked up and the key thrown away, but that has nothing to tell us about the generality of young offenders, most of whom steal from cars or houses. Putting a 15-year-old car thief into an old-fashioned (and currently obsolete) approved school would guarantee that the Artful Dodger would quickly become Bill Sikes. No, I have not fallen into the hands of Hampstead do-gooders or, worse, social workers. As the two larger political parties are now agreed, persistent young offenders should be incarcerated, if only to protect their potential victims. That, however, is the easy part. The far more difficult task is to isolate the causes of crime, and to encourage local police forces, teachers, parents, employers - everyone - to take whatever steps seem likely to prevent this or that youngster from going wrong in the first place. For that you need social workers. Mr John Major appears to find this difficult to grasp. According to an account in the Mail on Sunday, the prime minister told his interviewer that 'society needs to condemn a little more and understand a little less'. This must rank as one of the more unfortunate pronouncements that Mr Major has made, in tune with Lady Thatcher's 'there is no such thing as society'. Disapproval of criminal behaviour is certainly necessary. We should condemn wrongdoing before breakfast, lunch and dinner. But wilfully understand less? The prime minister no doubt meant the excessive understanding that implies forgiveness of all misdemeanours, as in the song, Gee, Officer Krupke, by the 'distoibed' young Jets in West Side Story. If so, he should have made himself clear. Mr Kenneth Clarke is equally Delphic. He is selling bits of his soul for a few right-wing credentials, using phrases such as - did I hear him right? - 'nasty little pieces of work'. Like Mr Major, the home secretary has been jolted into such language by the appearance on the government's right flank of Mr Tony Blair, Mr Blair is making a simple, but potentially devastating political point. The Conservatives have been in office since 1979. Between 1980 and 1991 the number of notifiable offences recorded by the police doubled. The Tories may have captured the market for rhetoric about being tough on crime, but their methods have not worked. Mr Blair therefore offers a new chant: Labour is tough on crime and tough on the causes of crime. There is a certain amount of hokum in this. The statistics for recorded crime are notoriously unreliable. Surveys suggest that three or four times as many offences are committed as are put in the book by the police. The propensity for victims to report and the police to record particular crimes varies from place to place and year to year. We do not know, although many of us feel, that the crime rate has increased sharply. Our politicians correctly sense an upsurge of public disquiet about wrongdoing in general and, for the moment, juvenile offenders in particular. Mr Blair has responded to this with greater ingenuity than either the prime minister or the home secretary. He has attempted to neutralise the argument that Labour is 'soft on criminals' by attacking the government for not providing enough 'secure places' for young offenders. At the same time, Labour says, 'it is clear that drugs, drink, glue sniffing and truancy increase the size and seriousness of the crime problem'. In a thoughtful paper the party suggests practical improvements in the present arrangements for handling young criminals. Many similar ideas are, or soon will be, in Mr Clarke's mind. Labour says its first purpose is to 'stop youngsters getting into trouble', its second to divert first offenders from a life of crime. The theme has been taken up by another Labour politician, Mr David Blunkett, the shadow secretary for health. He argues for 'full-time community service for, say, a nine-month period for every young person between the ages of 16 and 21'. Such a domestic peace corps would certainly reduce crime, since most of it is committed by teenage boys. It is an idea all parties should work on, with some urgency. Mr Blunkett's paper for Labour's commission on social justice contains several suggestions as to how young people might be propelled into work. 'Those committed to a new 21st century welfare state,' he says, 'have to cease what has been seen as paternalistic and well-meaning indulgence of the sub-culture of thuggery, noise and nuisance, and anti-social behaviour, often linked with drug abuse.' Labour has correctly perceived that victims must be protected from criminals. Everything that might prevent young people from turning to crime must be tried, but there will be failures, persistent recidivists. They have to be locked up, although there will be a price to pay. Meanwhile, there is no need to lose our heads.</p>

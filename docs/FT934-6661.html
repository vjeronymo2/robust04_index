			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / The best grades but still no jobs MORE than a third of the 17,000 part-time students at Bilston Community College in the West Midlands, which topped the government's league table for vocational results, are unemployed. Many would like to undertake full-time study but government rules on the amount of study that an individual can undertake while unemployed prevent this. Government regulations prevent most individuals from doing more than 21 hours in college. To do so would mean losing their benefit. Mrs Gillian Shephard, the former secretary of state for employment, investigated whether this limit could be removed but settled for a numerically limited scheme called Learning for Work, which allows long-term unemployed people to be officially available for work but to study for more than 21 hours. Mr Keith Wymer, the college's principal, said that some of his students were eligible for this scheme but it was very limited. 'Our unemployed part-time students are very well-motivated to study and are very committed to get a qualification in order to get a job,' he said. 'If they drop out it's generally for financial reasons.' The majority were over 18 and the most popular subjects were construction, social work, business and finance, and languages.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                            EDUCATION COLLEGES  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                              A-levels:                           Vocational         2 or more  A levels: fewer                          qualifications      entered     than 2 entered                           (BTec City        Num-  Aver-   Num-   Aver-                               &amp;

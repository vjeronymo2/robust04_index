			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (32): Programmes can play extra time - Alternative Investments / Values are limited, but there are signs that soccer's memorabilia is coming into its own THOUSANDS OF soccer fans will treasure programmes bought at this month's FA Cup semi-finals and next month's final. They may become heirlooms, but will they appreciate in value? Football programmes are an untilled field for the investor-collector. Unlike cricket or golf, there has been limited interest in the memorabilia of soccer. This has the advantage that prices for football programmes are low and within the reach of any interested buyer, and the disadvantage that they are unlikely to prove potential money spinners. Angus Gull, of Phillips (which, along with Christie's in Scotland, offers the occasional important football programme in its sporting memorabilia auctions), constantly has to let down gently collectors who approach the saleroom about the possibility of disposing of their group of 300 or so programmes of Chelsea or Aston Villa. They would barely make Pounds 100, which is Phillips' cut-off point for a lot. The fact is that many football supporters hang on to their programmes, which means there are millions of them piling up from the 1970s and 1980s, and virtually all of them are valueless. Collecting programmes is very much like collecting stamps - to get you started, dealers will sell you a job lot of 500 different programmes for perhaps Pounds 30. But once interest has been aroused the serious collector starts to specialise, and then larger sums are involved. As with stamps, most collectors choose their particular subject - usually the programmes of the club they support - and then try and build up a comprehensive archive of past programmes. Some branch out down interesting by-ways: clubs no longer in the League, a programme from every League club - or even every non-League club. One golden rule is: the older the programme, the higher its value; although condition is very important, and a pre-war programme which is creased, held together by sticky tape, or which has rusting staples, loses much of its appeal. Even the entry of team changes in pen or pencil will reduce the price. As well as age, the importance, or peculiarity, of the match is paramount. FA Cup finals, international matches, benefits, matches which were in some way odd (third replays or abandoned games), the first or last matches of a team in the Football League (if you have Aldershot's last one, hang on to it), or involving teams no longer in existence - all of these are positive price factors. Programmes can be acquired through supporters groups, from club shops, from dealers who congregate at collectors' fairs or who advertise in football magazines or in Exchange and Mart and comparable journals. What sort of programme would excite the dealers, prompting them to use the tantalising tag, 'offers in advance of Pounds 50 considered'? Last October, Christie's in Scotland sold an FA Cup Final programme from 1897 for Pounds 1,760, which could well be a record for a football programme. It had been hidden away as a bookmark and was in good condition. It is unlikely that any items which we would recognise as programmes were produced before the 1890s, and for the next few decades they were often flimsy, unimaginative documents. Another obvious rarity, a programme from the first Wembley Cup Final, in 1923, between West Ham United and Bolton Wanderers, was sold recently at Phillips for Pounds 308. A programme from this match appears every year or so, and can make up to Pounds 370, depending on its condition. Other high prices at auction include the Pounds 165 paid for the programme for the benefit match of the celebrated Celtic player Patsy Gallaher; Pounds 297 for the England-Scotland 1928 international, when the Wembley Wizards dazzled the crowd; and Pounds 990 for a bound Royal Box programme from the 1923 Cup Final. However a complete run of Sheffield Wednesday programmes for 1906-07 failed to reach its Pounds 1,000 target, attracting bids of just Pounds 850, probably because they, too, were bound together. Programmes which cannot be split up are less valuable than loose items. Arsenal is far and away the most collected team; and London clubs generally attract higher prices than Liverpool and Manchester United, perhaps because Londoners have more money or are prepared to spend it frivolously. Christie's in Scotland was surprised to get a price of over Pounds 500 for just 75 West Ham and Arsenal programmes of the 1940s and 1950s. As you move down the divisions, prices fall, although when the disc jockey John Peel picked up the Scottish team Meadowbank Thistle and mentioned it in his radio programme there was a flurry of interest in its programmes. As a rule of thumb, programmes from the 1970s and 1980s are of little or no value; programmes of important matches from the 1940s might go up to Pounds 10; of the 1930s to Pounds 30; and the 1920s for Pounds 40. Anything dating from before 1914, and especially pre-1900, is very rare and worth serious money. For anyone interested in soccer, collecting programmes offers a cheap and intriguing hobby which, over time, could prove a good investment. The market is fairly flat at the moment, thanks to the recession, but there are signs that football memorabilia is coming slowly into its own. Here are some typical prices quoted by a leading dealer (Collectables , 335, High Street, Rochester, Kent): FA Cup Final of 1920-21 between Tottenham and Wolverhampton (Pounds 550-Pounds 600); QPR versus Oldham 1965 (50p-Pounds 1); Arsenal v Sparta 1946 (Pounds 2-Pounds 4); Manchester United v Leeds, FA Cup semi-final 1970 (Pounds 1-Pounds 3). Obviously there is little in this price range to frighten off potential buyers.</p>

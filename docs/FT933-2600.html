			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / Survey of International Mergers &amp; Acquisitions (1): New-style deals appear - Hostile takeovers are out, joint ventures, alliances and negotiated deals are in, Tracy Corrigan writes. There has been a persistent trickle of deals so far this year - and there are new opportunities in the emerging markets of Asia and eastern Europe BOOMING stock markets and low interest rates spell better times for the international mergers and acquisitions business. Although no one expects activity to return to the frenetic pace seen in the 1980s, some recovery in the volume of traditional M&amp;A deals is becoming apparent. While the lucrative fees earned by hostile takeovers are not expected to return, there are new types of business for banks, more suited to the business cycle of the 1990s. There has been 'a shift from very transaction-oriented business in the 1980s, back to a relationship-orientation,' says Mr Stephen Waters, head of investment banking in Europe and co-head of Morgan Stanley International. There will also be 'less expansion into new business areas, more building-up of core business,' says Mr Richard Sapp, a managing director of M&amp;A at Goldman Sachs. The increase in international competition, as barriers between markets have fallen, has focused business leaders' attention. It has become more difficult for companies to compete on an international scale, forcing them to be more alert to opportunities to plug geographical holes. Large companies expanding overseas are looking for acquisitions which fit strategically with their main business and provide economies of scale which help cope with the strains of operating internationally They are keen to look at options other than acquisition, such as joint ventures. But those companies which are starting to look round for strategic acquisitions remain very cautious about paying over the odds. 'The main question is: does this make sense strategically. Companies want first to pay less premium, and second to bind economic interests together,' says Mr Piers von Simson, a director of Warburg. Sentiment continues to turn against the conglomerate, as companies take the view that in order to remain competitive they need to focus on their core business. Some companies are still de-gearing, after building up debt too rapidly in the 1980s; this may involve divestitures, or 'unbundling'. 'There has been a lot of restructuring in Europe,' says Mr Stephen Brisby, head of corporate finance at UBS, which consists in part of 'undoing things that were done in the 1970s and 1980s.' In the US and the UK, the process of unbundling in order to refocus on core business is well under way, but there is likely to be a substantial growth in activity in continental Europe in the next few years. The most important demerger of the year was ICI's flotation of its pharmaceuticals division to form a new company, Zeneca. The move was followed by Pearson, which is demerging its Royal Doulton china company in order to concentrate on its media and publishing interests. Other similar deals are expected to follow. 'Companies with disparate businesses are asking themselves whether they are worth more together or apart,' says Mr von Simson. 'In Europe, there are a lot of conglomerate holding companies, which trade at a discount, like investment trusts.' He thinks that UK and US companies have been forced to re-evaluate their structure at an earlier stage because they went into a cyclical downturn earlier - and generally have more vocal shareholders. But, as the ownership of shares in European companies becomes increasingly international, the focus on share price performance and dividend growth is also set to increase. Many prominent continental European companies are still run as conglomerates  -for example, Daimler-Benz, which runs not only a car and aerospace business but also a washing machine manufacturer. The growing competitiveness brought about by the breakdown in barriers between markets in capital-intensive industries has also fuelled activity as leading companies seek to consolidate their positions. 'In publishing and pharmaceuticals, for example, every opportunity has been crawled over by the leading companies in the sector,' says Mr von Simson. Pressures for consolidation are also set to increase in the banking and insurance sectors across Europe. Mr Waters at Morgan Stanley says that there has been a blurring of the lines between some industries, such as insurance and banking, and media and technology. For example, there have been deals between telecommunications and computer hardware and software companies. Privatised utilities in the UK are proving themselves keen to expand overseas. For example, the water companies are moving into pollution control and the electricity generators are buying overseas electricity companies. The consolidation of the airline industry also still has some way to go: the most important deal currently in the making is the joint venture of four European airlines, SAS, KLM, Swissair, and Austrian Airlines . But the European single market has not proved as great a catalyst as predicted, although a number of sectors, such as insurance, have seen pan-European consolidation. The European super-company has not materialised, but links such as Renault and Volvo and Reed and Elsevier may point the way. However, some bankers think that joint ventures are inherently unstable and will either lead to full scale integration - as in the case of Renault and Volvo - or collapse. In continental Europe there are many smaller family-owned companies under pressure to expand their businesses in order to compete, but with no access to the necessary capital. Increasing numbers of such companies are likely to go public, or to be sold off to larger groups, bankers believe - although the process has already lagged behind their expectations. Throughout Europe, a wave of privatisations is about to break - with an estimated price tag of more than Dollars 100bn over the next four or five years, according to Morgan Stanley Research. Although most governments claim to be ideologically motivated, a crucial factor is that the receipts from privatisation will help plug the worsening budget deficits faced by most European countries. 'There is not a country in Europe which is not contemplating some form of privatisation of its telecommunications industry,' says Mr von Simson. 'The capital requirements are enormous. How will the Bundespost be able to finance the modernisation of former East Germany's telecommunications system, at a cost of DM60bn?' Analysts are also predicting more airline, railway and toll road privatisations. As the process of privatisation becomes more sophisticated - for example, governments can choose between selling off companies, or stakes in companies, publicly or to other companies - the role of investment bankers has increased. Bankers are also giving increasing attention to the emerging markets, which are expected to be a source of growing activity. Some Latin American deals have already taken place, most notably the acquisition by Cemex, Mexico's cement company, of Spain's two largest cement companies. But the developing markets in the Far East are the subject of the greatest enthusiasm among bankers, particularly China, where the combination of the shift towards capitalism and the potentially enormous market for distribution are fuelling interest. 'Europe offers the opportunity to buy into a mature market, and values are now more attractive, says Mr Sapp at Goldman. 'But the far east is the great expansion opportunity.' However, most markets remain highly restrictive in terms of foreign ownership, or have few sizeable companies. 'The far east may be the market of the future but entry is through green-field (or start-up) operations because with very few exceptions there is nothing to buy, or if there is, it is impossible to buy it,' says Mr von Simson. But of all the emerging markets, Eastern Europe has proved the most difficult nut for M&amp;A advisers to crack. Relative to expectations, the level of activity remains low, and bankers are rather pessimistic about any immediate improvement in prospects. Acquisitions are not always the most attractive way to move into Eastern Europe, according to Mr Klaus Diederichs at JP Morgan. 'In the food industry, for instance, what you are paying for in an acquisition is brand, distribution and product - none of these do you get in Eastern Europe.' After a difficult start to the decade, therefore, the mergers and acquisitions business appears to be finding a new sense of direction, more in tune with fundamental economic trends. The growth of business in the emerging markets, and through large privatisation programmes, has provided the M&amp;A business with a useful fillip. The buzzwords of the 1980s - the LBOs (leverage buy-outs) and the HLTs (highly-leveraged transactions) - have given way to new catch phrases, such as rationalisation, relationship-banking and core business.</p>

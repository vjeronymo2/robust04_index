			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / Books: Symbol of a disillusioned age - Peter Aspden finds it hard not to warm to the anguished man who would be king THE PRINCE OF WALES: A BIOGRAPHY by Jonathan Dimbleby Little, Brown Pounds 20, 640 pages Just a couple of months before Princess Elizabeth gave birth to her first son, a report in the New York Times delivered a waspish verdict on post-war Britain: 'an impoverished second-rate power, morally magnificent but economically bankrupt'. Today, the feeling that Britain has some kind of special reserve of probity which can compensate for its otherwise sagging fortunes is distinctly unfashionable. Jonathan Dimbleby's sympathetic biography is as much the story of that decline, of the gradual coarsening of a nation's sensibility, as the tale of a man who, racked by self-doubt, has come to symbolise Britain's crisis of identity. That the two - nation and heir - are symbiotically related has surely been demonstrated time and time again, not least by the roller-coaster tale of love, estrangement and high farce which the world has come to know as Charles-and-Di. The hysterical reception given to their courtship and wedding smacked of desperation; the price paid for the marriage's failure is the nation's bitter revenge for being so acutely disillusioned. It is hard not to warm to Charles from Dimbleby's portrayal; a grown man, capable of agonising intensity, who still expresses himself in the puerile vocabulary of the Eagle, the boy's comic given to him by his loving great-uncle Lord Mountbatten. The future King's moral universe, as expressed in his diary, refuses to veer beyond the boundaries of 'beastly' and 'jolly'; even after the humiliating tour of Korea and Hong Kong in 1992, by which time the fairy tale wedding had turned to nightmare, his ire was cloaked in the terminology of a schoolboy about to have his tuckshop allowance taken away: 'I feel so unsuited to the ghastly business of human intrigue and general nastiness . . . I don't know what will happen from now on, but I dread it.' The marriage to Diana was something he could - and should - have been talked out of; but who was there? Certainly not his mother, whose minimal presence in her son's biography speaks volumes: while Charles prevaricated over whether to take 'la grande plonge' (sic), we read that 'characteristically in relation to such matters, the Queen refrained from tendering her opinion'. Whether she exercised similar restraint when the blushing bride started head-butting the glass cabinets is not known, but the widely-publicised lack of intimacy in this very mixed-up family cannot fail to have blunted the Prince's sense of self-worth. To his credit, Charles has not allowed the blunderings of his private life to divert him from the quite complex socio-political positions he has embraced. In many ways, he would make a perfect monarch for the current age; his modish mix of eastern philosophies, eco-concern and community politics certainly strikes more of a chord today than it did at the beginning of the 1980s. Interestingly, he has one ambition left; after a famous gala White House dinner in 1985, he reflected: 'Travolta asked Diana to dance, he whisked her about the floor and everyone left them on their own until I joined in eventually with a very good American ballerina, whose name I forget. Sadly there were no lovely actresses or singers. I had been rather hoping that Diana Ross would be there . . .' Another Diana? Forget it.</p>

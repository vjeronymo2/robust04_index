			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Ruzbeh Bu ol-Hari: "Reasons for U.S. Request </F> for Talks With Iran"]    [Text] Last week, the United States made two requests for  improved relations with Iran and for talks with our country's  officials. In view of the policy of erecting barriers against  Iran as announced by the Bill Clinton Administration, the  remarks by the high-level U.S. officials are worth pondering  over for the following reasons:    Three views can be presented with regard to Washington's  latest stance:    1. The victory of Russian President Yeltsin's  opponents--that is, the communists and the nationalists--in the  Russian parliamentary elections and the daily mounting impact of  their viewpoints on the domestic and foreign policy making which  has inspired apprehension in the United States and its allies.    Washington is concerned over the possibility of Yeltsin's  opponents taking over power and the resumption of worldwide  confrontation, which could endanger its interests. This is why  in the past months we have witnessed moves by the United States,  including suggested plans for collaboration for peace and  extensive activity to prevent the revival of Russian influence  in these regions.    These moves, which are aimed at creating a security belt as  well as a quarantine around Moscow, encounter a vacuum in only  one area -- that is, Iran. This is because in the event of any  anti-Western moves in Russia and the possibility of cooperation  between the new leaders in Moscow with Tehran, the balance of  power in the Persian Gulf and the Middle East will shift to the  detriment of the West, especially since the oil routes in the  Persian Gulf pass south of Iran.    2. Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Central,  and Southern Asia faced a power vacuum. The U.S. relations with  Pakistan became strained. It does not have any influence in  this particular region at present, and this situation has made  its effects felt on other regions.    Meanwhile, even though the United States has endeavored to  implement plans for the breakup of many countries in Asia, this  is still the beginning. The efforts by the PRC, Iran, and India  to initiate joint cooperation in the region can endanger U.S.  interests. Meanwhile Washington is reviewing its frigid  relations with Pakistan and by supporting it on the Kashmir  issue it is seeking to fill the power vacuum. However, this  will not give it much clout over the power triangle of Tehran,  Beijing and New Delhi. Such a power triangle can shatter  Washington's goal of domineering on the Asian continent.    3. The rising tide of Islamism in the Middle East has  increased the danger of the downfall of the reactionary regimes,  and this threatens the interests of the United States and its  international allies, who are all seeking to serve their own  interests. In addition, the rising tendency among the  Palestinians to join groups such as the Hamas in the wake of the  Hebron massacre could, in the view of the United States, be  repeated in every part of the Middle East.    It is in the above perspective that we can view the renewed  request on the part of Washington for talks and improved  relations with Iran. This is an issue which by itself indicates  the importance of Iran in international relations; and this will  be enhanced further in the event of any regional or  international upheaval.    Therefore, it is from this vantage point that the United  States -- taking into account the existing distinctive  circumstances -- wishes to create conditions necessary for an  improvement of relations with Iran so that in the future it will  not encounter dangerous situations on strategic issues.    This demands twice as much vigilance on our part so that we  can utilize our geopolitical [preceding word in English]  position in our approach to regional and international  developments and be alert to U.S. ploys.</p>

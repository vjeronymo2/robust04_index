			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Commercial enterprises will discontinue  activities at noon on Friday, 28 January, and will resume them  at noon on Wednesday, 9 February, to compel the parties involved  in the Haitian crisis to submit themselves to the interests of  the nation, forcing the sanctions against the country to be  lifted.    This is the resolution adopted by the 15 employers'  associations who gathered yesterday at the Villa Creole Hotel.  Our colleague Jean Luckenson attended this session. Let us  listen to his report.    [Begin recording, in Creole] All commercial and industrial  enterprises and services will discontinue operations as of  Friday, 28 January at noon, until Wednesday, 9 February  inclusive, to force all concerned parties to submit themselves  to the superior interests of the nation and to obtain the  lifting of the embargo against Haiti. This is the resolution  that emerged from the meeting held by 15 of the 16 employers'  associations on Tuesday, 25 January, at the Villa Creole Hotel  on the economic crisis the country has been experiencing for  over 28 months, and which has become increasingly more alarming  as a result of the fuel problem, and which has already caused  much ink to flow. [passage omitted]    The decision resulting from this meeting does not concern  the  health sector. All of the employers agree to create a crisis  committee, which will have the mission of ensuring follow-up of  the resolutions that resulted from the 25 January meeting. A  report will be sent to the employers' associations, which will  meet again to adopt whatever additional measures might be  necessary.    By the way, the employers' sector recommended that insofar  as  possible, its members take the interests of the workers into  account. We should tell you that this meeting began at 0930 and  ended at 1800, and was held at the initiative of the Haitian  Chamber of Commerce [and Industry], which had several times  requested the lifting of the embargo against Haiti.

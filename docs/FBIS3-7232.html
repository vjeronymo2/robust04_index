Referring to  North Korea's suspected nuclear development during a meeting  with former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, the South Korean  president said: "I think that North Korea does not have nuclear  weapons." This is the first time the president has acknowledged  the nonexistence of nuclear weapons in North Korea since he  arrived in Japan. The president went on to say: "North Korea  is eager to develop nuclear weapons, however, I intend to  resolve the issue while closely cooperating with Japan."</p>

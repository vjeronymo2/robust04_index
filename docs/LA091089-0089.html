			<p><P> September 10, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TIME SLIPS BY SHAREHOLDERS WITH SOME FANCY FOOTWORK  </P> <P> It takes a rare and special talent to avoid two separate shareholder votes on a  single deal. But the managers of Time Inc. have managed to rise to the  occasion.  </P> <P> The transaction, of course, is the so-called merger with Warner Communications.  The first end run took place this summer when Time management canceled a  shareholder vote on the Warner deal and reformulated the deal so that it could  be done without shareholder approval.  </P> <P> Although Time denies it, a major reason -- if not the reason -- for changing  the deal's structure was that Time's shareholders were almost certain to vote  the deal down. Paramount Communications was offering $200 a share for Time in a  hostile takeover at the time, and most of Time's holders, if left to their own  devices, would have taken the $200 and nixed the Warner deal. So Time's  managers didn't leave the shareholders to their own devices.  </P> <P> The second end run around Time's holders is taking place even as you read this.  But unlike the canceling of the shareholder vote, which was an obvious and  crude maneuver, this maneuvering is subtle. So subtle, in fact, that it takes a  while to explain.  </P> <P> To understand what's going on here, you have to remember that even though Time  now calls itself Time Warner Inc., it hasn't actually combined with Warner and  won't do so until later this year. Time, which bought 100 million Warner shares  for $7 billion cash in July, is finishing the deal by buying Warner's 86.8  million remaining shares for securities valued at $70 a share. And of those  securities, $61 consists of two new issues of Time Warner convertible preferred  stock -- which is where the trick comes in.  </P> <P> In the investment world, "convertible" almost always means "convertible into  common stock," and that's the way Time Warner has described this deal to the  world. One of the preferreds is convertible at $200 a share, the company says,  and the other is convertible at $225.  </P> <P> Watch closely, now. Between them, the two preferreds will have a face value of  about $5.35 billion, and will be convertible into more than 25 million shares  of Time Warner common stock. Since Time Warner has about 60 million shares of  common stock outstanding, issuing the new convertible preferreds is the same as  increasing the number of Time Warner common shares by more than 40%.  </P> <P> It so happens that New York Stock Exchange rules require that in a case like  this, an exchange-listed company must get its shareholders' approval to  increase the number of outstanding shares by more than 20%. In this case, the  20% threshold is about 12 million new shares. Issuing more than 12 million new  shares without stockholder authorization would force the NYSE to throw Time  Warner off the exchange: a major embarrassment to the company.  </P> <P> Even with the New Math, a 25-million share increase is more than a 12-million  share increase. So how can Time Warner issue its $5.35 billion of convertible  stock without getting thrown off the New York Stock Exchange? Because, it turns  out, the new preferred stock isn't really convertible into common stock --  unless Time Warner shareholders first approve the issuance of the new common  shares and at this point, no such vote is scheduled.  </P> <P> Instead, the preferred stocks are convertible into something called  "participating preferred stock" at $190 and $213.75 a share, respectively,  rather than at the $200 and $225 conversion prices that Time has told people  about. (Don't even ask what the "participating preferred stock" is. Just accept  that it's not a security that Time Warner wants to issue and it isn't a  security you want to own.)  </P> <P> This fascinating "participating preferred" makes a fleeting appearance in the  part of Time Warner's press release that's designed not to be read or  understood: three dense, single-spaced paragraphs tucked in the middle of an  otherwise lucid, double-spaced release. You have to read these so-called  technicals and then plow through Time Warner's formal filing at the Securities  and Exchange Commission to figure this out.  </P> <P> The Time Warner public relations people -- who, as far as I can tell, didn't  intentionally mislead anyone, but were as confused as anyone by the  technicalities -- say the company isn't free to discuss any aspect of this  deal, other than what's written in the press release.  </P> <P> But Time Warner has apparently explained its "participating preferred" move to  some securities analysts and to the New York Stock Exchange the same way that a  football team about to execute a trick play usually alerts the referee and  linemen. You don't want to be called for a penalty when you are technically  within the rules.  </P> <P> At some point, presumably, Time Warner will get around to asking its  shareholders to approve issuing the new shares that its managers have already  publicly committed the company to issuing -- and the whole thing will probably  sail right through.  </P> <P> That couldn't have been said a few months ago when many large Time shareholders  were upset that the company end ran them and did the Warner deal without a  shareholder vote. Given that history, the company could have had a fight on its  hands had it asked the shareholders for permission to issue a huge number of  new shares to consummate a transaction that many were opposed to in the first  place. Failing to get approval wouldn't have queered the deal, but it would  have limited Time Warner's financial flexibility and greatly increased the cost  of the transaction, which is already hellishly expensive.  </P> <P> Time Warner obviously made all the disclosures legally required: I had access  only to publicly available documents and figured out what was going on. But a  corporation that still fancies itself a journalism company with a duty to truth  should live up to the spirit of the securities laws, as well as to their  letter. Don't hold your breath waiting for that to happen.  </P></p>

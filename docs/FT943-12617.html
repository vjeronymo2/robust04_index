			<p>940723 FT  23 JUL 94 / Motoring: Promise unfulfilled - Stuart Marshall asks why four-wheel drive is not more common When Audi unveiled the first Quattro at the Geneva Show in 1980, it seemed that all high-performance cars of the future would have full-time four-wheel drive. Having tried it, I certainly thought so. The ease with which this potent turbo-charged coupe could be driven quickly and safely on surfaces ranging from dry tarmac to loose gravel and frozen slush was a new experience. That was in 1980. Actually, the Quattro was not the first 4x4 road car of its kind. Jensen had beaten Audi to it by some years with the FF model. But Jensen made only a small number of FFs and, sadly, I never got my hands on one. The Quattro started a trend that other volume makers followed. Four-wheel drive has since swept the world of rallying but not of normal motoring. For road cars, it is a story of promise unfulfilled. Audi still offers the quattro with all-wheel drive transmission on its complete range. There have been - in some cases there still are - all-wheel driven versions of cars such as the Ford Scorpio and BMW 5-Series, Porsche 911 and Peugeot 405. They are, however, a minority choice. And most of the really high-performance cars - Ferraris, Aston-Martins, BMW 8-Series, Mercedes SL and so on - are rear-wheel driven. Motorists associate four-wheel drive road-going vehicles mainly with keeping going in snow. Very good they are at it, too. (Paradoxically, 4x4 on-off roaders are much less popular in Lapland, where winter lasts for six months, than in England's lifestyle-conscious home counties. Northern Scandinavians rely on spiked snow tyres and, to a growing extent, traction control.) By matching power output to tyre grip a traction control system (TCS) curbs wheelspin on slippery surfaces. Cars fitted with it are unfazed by snowy hills. Just as significantly, they do not become unruly if accelerated savagely, or cornered imprudently fast, on wet roads. TCS is now standard on some cars with an abundance of power (such as the latest turbocharged Rover 600ti and Vitesse Sport) and offered by manufacturers as an option on others. They have been persuaded that it gives many of the benefits of permanently engaged four-wheel drive without the extra weight, complication and cost. Subaru begs to differ. It is wedded to four-wheel drive. Apart from a recently introduced front-wheel driven entry model Impreza family saloon or hatchback, it has sold nothing but four-wheel drive cars for years. Currently they range from the tiny Vivio (Pounds 7,047), supermini-sized Justy (from Pounds 8,149), Impreza 4WD (from Pounds 12,849) and Legacy (Pounds 13,999 upwards) to the stunning SVX, at Pounds 30,849 perhaps the most pleasurable high-performance coupe I have driven. When Subarus were first sold in Britain more than 20 years ago they had a simple kind of selectable four-wheel drive. Normally, the power went to the front wheels. When you felt the need for extra traction, you switched it through to the rear wheels as well. These early Subarus had high and low ranges of gears in four-wheel drive and were astonishingly capable off-road. Just how good I discovered on a military vehicle testing ground. Over terrain many owners of full-blooded on-off road 4x4s would not dream of venturing on, the Subaru just kept going, climbing 1-in-3 slopes, sliding its well-protected underside over high humps and plunging through wellie-deep water. Of course, knowing that a monster cross-country vehicle is ready to pull you out should you get stuck makes one feel very brave. I would not have gone where I did if my only recovery equipment had been a shovel. But country people who really have to drive across their own muddy fields and pull sheep trailers up steep hills know Subarus are very hard workers. Yet they behave like normal cars on proper roads. The latest Subaru to come my way was the 208 horsepower Impreza Turbo 2000 4WD. In common with all Subarus, apart from the Vivio microcar, it has an engine with horizontally-opposed cylinders - the kind Germans call a boxer. Like its Ford counterpart, the Escort RS Cosworth, it is based on a rally car but has been civilised for road use. It has far more performance than could possibly be exploited on the highway: a top speed of 142mph/229kph and 0-60mph/96kph acceleration of 6.3 seconds are claimed. What its four-wheel drive means in day-to-day motoring is complete sure-footedness regardless of road surface. The Impreza has power steering, driver's airbag and anti-lock braking as standard at Pounds 17,499 for the 4-door saloon, and Pounds 17,998 for the 5-door hatchback. Its insurance group is 17 compared with an Escort Cosworth's 20 and it comes with a three-year/60,000 mile (96,600km) warranty. The ride is firm, with some tyre thump, and the transmission majors on ruggedness. It seats four comfortably, five at a pinch, and has ample luggage space. But with all that eager performance it is not a car I would recommend to anyone with driving licence penalty points.</p>

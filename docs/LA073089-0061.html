			<p><P> July 30, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PAMPERED PETS;  </P> <P> FOR GREAT DANES OR GOLDFISH, TRADE SHOW HAS EVERYTHING  </P> <P> In booths that held dazzling displays of high-powered hair dryers,  stew-flavored bones and other pet products, manufacturers welcomed retailers  who carried shopping bags. The only animal in sight, except for fish in  aquariums, was a poodle in a polka-dot dress.  </P> <P> The poodle and its owner, designer Patricia Henderson of Silk-N-Satin pet  fashions, also wearing a polka-dot dress, were of little professional interest  to Claire Sanford of Whittier at the pet industry's annual trade show at the  Long Beach Convention Center.  </P> <P> "That's a specialty, something for people who live in Beverly Hills," Sanford  said. The owner of a tropical-fish store, Sanford is changing to dogs and cats,  and looked mostly for cages as she walked among the 400 exhibits last weekend.  </P> <P> But, like everyone else, Sanford laughed as Henderson dressed her poodle, GiGi,  in outfits to match the clothes of pet owners. The little dog posed calmly, but  upon hearing a squeak, GiGi -- clad perhaps in a flowery Hawaiian number  through which her tail vibrated wildly -- would scamper away and disappear into  a toy booth.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Mink Coats for Parrots  </P> <P> Although Henderson, attending the trade show from Colonia, N.J., had no bird  models, she told prospective buyers that she also enjoys making imitation mink  coats for parrots.  </P> <P> "It's not easy," she explained. "You have to cut the coat in a certain way so  they can move their wings."  </P> <P> The trade show was held in Long Beach, not only for its convenient location,  said Thomas McLaughlin, executive vice president of the Western World Pet  Supply Assn., but "because we're largely a family industry, and there are a lot  of things for a family to do here."  </P> <P> Sanford, who has a cat, dog, turtle, tarantula, tortoise and frog at home,  called herself a typical pet person. "It's a nice business," she said. "Most of  the people you meet are nice. You get few bad checks."  </P> <P> Although boutique companies such as Henderson's have been entering the  industry, most of the exhibitors showed the basic equipment required by  operators of pet shops, grooming shops and feed stores.  </P> <P> There were colorful arrays of bowls, collars and leashes; scientific-looking  displays of flea-fighting shampoos and medications, and pyramids of natural dog  food and low-ash cat food.  </P> <P> As he pointed out the exhibits, McLaughlin offered some observations:  </P> <P> "We call (pets) 'companion animals' -- that's the term coming into the  culture."  </P> <P> "Twenty percent of the pet industry's sales are in California."  </P> <P> "Twenty years ago there were twice as many dogs as cats in the United States,  but now there are 55 million cats and 52 million dogs. That has to be caused by  more people moving into condominiums and apartments, and (because) cats are  easier to keep."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Yuppie Puppy Treet  </P> <P> But products for dogs still have an audience. At the Carousel Industries booth,  Patti Page appeared on a television screen to sing "How Much Is That Doggie in  the Window" to introduce a video promoting the Yuppie Puppy Treet Machine. Next  to the TV was a gumball-type machine, designed to discharge a snack when a dog  presses his paw on the bone-shaped handle.  </P> <P> "We're moving them," said salesman Brent Kaplan of Des Plaines, Ill.  </P> <P> Though he had no numbers for them, McLaughlin noted that birds and fish are  rising rapidly in popularity.  </P> <P> Since fish are hot, the aquarium people looked confident.  </P> <P> "Fish definitely are the big thing," said Mike Calli, owner of American  Aquatics Inc. of Paramount, as he stood before a row of softly bubbling tanks.  "I haven't seen a child yet who isn't super excited about aquariums and fish."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Fluorescent Shipwrecks  </P> <P> Aquariums of all sizes, some elaborately housed in tall wood furniture,  beckoned in almost every aisle. They were filled with living reefs and bright  fish that once might have lived off Key West. The fish swam among fluorescent  shipwrecks and sea monsters in clear, clean ocean water.  </P> <P> One company sold not aquariums but videotapes of fish swimming in beautiful  tropical waters. Set to classical music, the tapes are big with Chicago  yuppies, said Allen Brelig, president of Petvision of Oak Park, Ill. Colette  Fairchild, the firm's vice president, mentioned that a study at an Eastern  university had proved that watching fish can calm people.  </P> <P> The weekend included a dog-grooming contest and seminars on "great business  ideas" and "managing stress in fish." Saturday night the pet people danced and  drank beer, rum-and-Cokes and 7-and-7s at a party at the Hyatt Regency Hotel.  </P> <P> Over the party's loud music, Richard Peterson, 66, a distributor from Pebble  Beach, recalled selling horse meat for dog food in the late 1940s. The pet  industry was just getting started about that time because of a parakeet craze.  </P> <P> "It's come a long way," Peterson said. "It's a great industry, and it's so  small that I can go from booth to booth and know everybody."  </P> <P> By late Sunday afternoon, the show had begun to wind down.  </P> <P> Over near the dog training videos, one salesman said to another: "Let me out of  here. I'm out of literature, I'm out of cards."  </P> <P> He wasn't the only one ready to call it a day.  </P> <P> GiGi, pooped from two days of posing, lay serenely beneath a display of bird  hats. She seemed happy, even though she didn't have a stitch on.  </P></p>

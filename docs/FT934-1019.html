			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / Spanish movie-goers locked out: Protest over law against non-EU films A government attempt to keep out US films yesterday prompted Spain's cinema theatre owners to lock out film-goers. The unprecedented protest, which closed down all the country's 1,807 cinemas for 24 hours, followed emergency legislation that aims to protect the domestic film sector by forcing exhibitors to screen one production originating from the European Union for every two produced outside the EU. The new law was hurriedly drafted in the mistaken belief that the Gatt agreement would include the audovisual industry in the trade liberalisation measures. The legislation, which was approved by the cabinet as a decree law just five days before the December 15 Gatt deadline, is due to be ratified by MPs tomorrow. If the law stands and is rigorously implemented it is likely to keep the cinema public, which prefers Hollywood productions, at home and drive many exhibitors who depend on US films for the bulk of their profits, out of business. The law states that distributors seeking a dubbing licence for a non-EU film must satisfy the authorities they have earned Pta20m (Dollars 143,000) from screening a Spanish or EU-produced film. The regulations for obtaining a second non-EU licence are convoluted: the distributors must have earned a minimum of Pta50m from screening the EU film in question in more than 10 cinemas in population centres of more than 45,000 and they must also have previously dubbed the EU film into one of Spain's minority languages such as Catalan or Basque. Under the previous guidelines distributors got licenses to dub four foreign films for every one Spanish production they marketed. US films account for nearly half the 990 films shown in Spain during 1992, to 62.5m customers representing 77 per cent of the film-going public and for 75 per cent of the Pta36.2bn total box office takings. The Spanish film industry, which the government subsidises and now seeks to protect further, is on the whole meagre and of low quality. Of the 320 new productions released in Spain last year, only 32 were Spanish and of these only nine grossed more than Pta100m.</p>

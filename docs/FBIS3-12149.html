			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Abu Dhabi, 25 Feb (WAKH) -- The United Arab Emirates  has strongly condemned the heinous, ugly crime perpetrated by  the Zionist settlers in the Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron at dawn  today.    A responsible source at the UAE Foreign Ministry held Israel  fully responsible for this massacre because it has continued to  arm them and overlook their repeated crimes and attacks on the  defenseless Palestinian citizens in the occupied territories.    In a statement disseminated by the EMIRATES NEWS AGENCY, the  source said this massacre, which took place under the eyes of  the Israeli occupation forces, proves beyond doubt the Israeli  Government's collusion with the criminals.    The source called on the international community, headed by  the Security Council and the big powers supporting the peace  process, to undertake a serious and effective move that goes  beyond condemnation and denunciation and to adopt tangible,  decisive, and practical steps to protect the Palestinian city  [as received].</p>

			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / Survey of Lanarkshire (5): The enterprise clock is ticking - Lanarkshire's infrastructure now includes an Enterprise Zone divided into nine sites MR John Condliffe, a top official at Scottish Enterprise, was a leading advocate of setting up an enterprise zone in Lanarkshire to 'kick-start' its regeneration. 'We think that with an enterprise zone we can achieve in five years what would otherwise take ten,' he said. Now little more than two years after that statement was made and nearly a year after Mr Condliffe's untimely death in middle age, the Lanarkshire enterprise zone is up and running. It formally came into existence on February 1 this year and expires in 2003. As Mr Archie Bethel, chief executive of the Lanarkshire Development Agency says: 'The clock is ticking. We have got 10 years.' Enterprise zones offer companies which set up on them exemption from business rates, 100 per cent allowances on corporation tax for capital expenditure on buildings, and greatly simplified planning procedures. Yet when Mr Condliffe spoke, the tide seemed to be moving against EZs. Both the government and the European Commission, which also has to approve them, had expressed doubts about the concept. The government had frequently said that each zone it set up would be the last, before eating its words and setting up another. Critics say that EZs merely transfer jobs and investment from other areas, while the EC has been sceptical of an initiative which it believes can distort competition. The zones have been seen, particularly by the Treasury, as a comparatively expensive way of generating jobs. However, although the original crop of EZs in Britain, created in the early 1980s, is now expiring, there are likely to be six zones in existence by 1994, three of them destined for areas hit by the latest coal closures. The Lanarkshire EZ comprises 507 acres and is divided into nine sites, ranging from 195 acres at Newhouse close to the Eurocentral freight terminal to a two acre site intended as an office development in the town of Hamilton. Mr Douglas Smith, of the chartered surveyors Richard Ellis in Glasgow, says the range and quality of sites on the Lanarkshire EZ are of 'by far the highest quality yet seen in the Scottish market.' They will appeal, he says, to manufacturers, office users and inward investors. At least one of the sites - Airbles Road in Motherwell - is not yet ready. But Monklands district council has already built 10,000 square feet of units on the Shawhead zone, with a further 10,000 sq ft under construction. At Tannochside the developer Meiklegate is in final negotiations with the LDA to put up 55,000 sq ft of industrial space, and Morrison Developments are close to agreement to build 78,000 sq ft of office space on the two acre Brandon Street site near the centre of Hamilton. Mr Bethel says the EZ aims to strike a balance between owner-occupier companies putting up bespoke buildings for their own use, and EZ trusts which are likely to build speculatively for later gains. The latter are likely to become more prominent next year as the Business Expansion scheme, which attracts about Pounds 1bn a year of funds, against the Pounds 250m attracted by EZ trusts, comes to an end. Mr Gerry Brough, inward investment manager at the LDA, says: 'We want to keep a balance between the different types of occupier, and we do not want to release too much land too quickly.' The LDA believes the EZ will generate 8,000 net new jobs over the 10 years. That same total has often been quoted for the number of jobs that should be supported by the 800-acre greenfield site which includes both Mossend and the Newhouse West zone. The Eurocentral rail freight terminal for Scotland's Channel Tunnel freight is being built on the western side. The terminal was to have been by Amec, the construction and development company. However, With uncertainty over the privatisation of British Rail, delays to the Channel Tunnel opening and the weak property market, Amec decided instead to concentrate on developing part of the adjoining land, while theLDA took on the terminal project. With the public sector taking responsibility, a Pounds 1.8m grant from the EuropeanRegional Development Fund was obtained to help towards the Pounds 8.6m cost of the project. The grant would not have been available for a private sector company. A 115 acre freight village should gradually be developed next to the 16-acre terminal. Alongside is the Mossend EZ site aimed at manufacturing, which is part-owned by Amec Regeneration. The Newhouse West EZ site, fronting on to the M8, is owned by ScottishEnterprise and is intended for large inward investors. The Eurocentral terminal will have modest beginnings when it opens, in time for the Channel Tunnel, next March. The LDA does not have the power to build advance factories, unlike the new towns. But the Scottish new towns are following their English counterparts and being wound up. East Kilbride will be wound up by the end of 1995 and is involved in a final Pounds 37m capital programme to complete the town. East Kilbride is the home of another important part of Lanarkshire's development network, the National Engineering Laboratory (NEL), a government industrial research organisation which briefly achieved prominence in 1988-89 when Lord Young, then the trade and industry secretary, made a botched attempt to privatise it. NEL is making itself more market-oriented and is developing a commercial customer list. Its own staff has been slimmed from 600 to 400. It occupies only five of the buildings on the site instead of 10. The site is now a serviced, high prestige business park, much of it occupied by small science-based businesses, some founded by ex-NEL staff. But all that is in the future.</p>

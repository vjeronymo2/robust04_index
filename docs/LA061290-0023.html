			<p><P> June 12, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> Food Fight: A group of NBC employees is engaged in a petition drive to save its  blue collar, family styled commissary, the butt of many a Johnny Carson barb.  As of July 16, a new, fancier dining service with a new, fancier and presumably  pricier menu will be installed at the network's Burbank home.  </P> <P> According to menus obtained by The Times, the new dining service will serve  such yup-scale dishes as "Southwestern charbroiled chicken breast with blue  corn pancakes" and "black fettucini and mixed seafood with tequila lime butter  sauce." The current commissary serves such delicacies as chef's salad, bacon  cheeseburger and cake. The petition expresses satisfaction with the current  "staff, food, prices and services" and protests any changes in this area. GREG  BRAXTON  </P></p>

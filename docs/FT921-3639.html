			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Hall Eng recovers in second half to Pounds 5.07m HALL Engineering (Holdings) reported static profits for 1991 of Pounds 5.07m, against Pounds 5.06m despite turnover falling from Pounds 190.4m to Pounds 147.4m following a much improved second half. The result was helped by two Singapore associates where profits doubled, contributing to share of associates of Pounds 5.01m (Pounds 3.44m). Borrowings fell Pounds 11.5m over the year for a 21 per cent fall in the interest charge to Pounds 4.34m (Pounds 5.46m). Gearing at the year end was 61 per cent, down from 70 per cent. At the interim stage the Shrewsbury-based company announced pre-tax profits down from Pounds 3.56m to Pounds 1.16m. During the second six months the Stafford factory of British Reinforced Concrete was sold and the Weldmesh and fencing operations were ended leading to an extraordinary charge of Pounds 6.9m. However some assets were sold at above book value for Pounds 6m and the overall cash effect was a Pounds 500,000 gain. A higher tax charge of Pounds 1.9m (Pounds 1.61m) left earnings per share lower at 11.34p (12.68p). A proposed maintained final dividend of 5.34p makes an unchanged total for the year of 8.64p.</p>

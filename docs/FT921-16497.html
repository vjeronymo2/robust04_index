			<p>920103 FT  03 JAN 92 / Arts: Parsifal - La Scala, Milan So much for planning ahead. Months ago, on leaving for an extended stay in America, I carefully booked my seat for the last performance of Parsifal, the new production scheduled to open the season at La Scala in Milan. It was to be conducted by the theatre's musical director Riccardo Muti, with Placido Domingo in the title role. In New York, I read about the triumphant reception, the memorable musical performance, the glamorous opening night. Back in Italy, a few days ago, as I was packing my bag for Milan and giving Ernest Newman a hasty re-read, I learned that my performance would not be conducted by Muti; and, further, most of the premiere's cast had dispersed. I went to the performance anyway, and my faith was rewarded. You can learn much about an opera house on an un-glamorous night, and, all things considered, La Scala came off well. First of all, the orchestra sounded fine. The replacement conductor - the, to me, totally unknown Niksa Bareza - may not have Muti's special intensity, but he has the same sense of musical architecture, and the reading was carefully shaped, dramatically gauged. Not electrifying, perhaps, but immensely satisfactory and truly felt. If the interpretation lacked a certain Nordic depth, it had, in compensation, a silken, Mediterranean sheen. And the clarity of the old houses's acoustics allowed the voices full scope. Of the original cast Wolfgang Brendel remained: an unusually vigorous Amfortas, with praiseworthy enunciation: opposite him, so to speak, Kurt Rydl was a convincing Gurnemanz: the voice was not always steady, but the singing implied the compassionate, all-understanding humanity that is essential to the part and to the whole drama. Monte Pederson was a dark, menacing Klingsor, and Gabriele Monici did his duty as Titurel effectively. In reality, though Parsifal and Kundry are the crucial figures in the opera, neither interpreter has an immense amount of singing to do; and the efficacy of their roles depends more on authority of presence than on vocal prowess. Still, the replacements for Domingo and for Waltraud Meier (the Kundry of the premiere) were somewhat puzzling and ill-paired. Warren Ellsworth (the Parsifal of the Welsh National Opera's production some years ago) is surely the most boyish-looking Wagner hero ever seen on a great opera stage: jug-eared and gangling, he is the very picture of adolescent innocence. The voice, too, sounded appropriately youthful in the first act; but, as the opera continued, the listener inevitably wanted greater power and expressiveness. Nevertheless, this was an acceptable, if under-scaled Parsifal. The Kundry of Dunja Vejzovich was another matter. The voice is certainly large enough, but at full volume it produces a less than pleasant sound. At the beginning of 'Ich sah das Kind', the singer established a softer, narrative tone, suited to the text and dramatically convincing; but in the later part of the second act she became shrill and imprecise, absurdly unseductive. She was not helped by the foolish costume (by Ettora d'Ettore) and a copper-coloured doormat of a wig. The Muti era - as it must now be considered - has not been distinguished by much positive visual excitement. Indeed, some of the conductor's most captivating performances musically were heard in conjunction with some of Luca Ronconi's most disastrous vagaries; and regular Scala-goers harbour doubts about Muti's visual sensibility. It is hard to conceive how he found acceptable the staging of Cesare Lievi, who treated Amfortas as a malingerer, denying him his usual litter, and allowed Kundry to survive at the end, when Amfortas, Gurnemanz, and Parsifal simply strolled off the stage, defying Wagner's specific directions and flattening the culmination of the great work. Lievi's brother Daniele (with Peter Laher) was responsible for the sets (the magic garden looked like the swimming pool area of a better-class motel). But then there was little magic in the whole conception: the transformation scenes were bewilderingly fudged (doors opening to reveal shining, posturing knights); the mop-headed flower-maidens in their Victorian dress looked like Shirley Temple dolls, dressed by May of Teck. And yet, the house, the orchestra, some of the singing, and above all, the music itself made the evening a pleasure. Parts were sometimes unacceptable, but their sum was still satisfying. The old magician of Bayreuth still has the power to emerge victorious from severe trials.</p>

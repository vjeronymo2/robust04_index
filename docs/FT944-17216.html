			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / Ford wooed over new Jaguar car The government has offered a financial aid package worth tens of millions of pounds to Ford, the US carmaker, in an effort to persuade it to build a new range of Jaguar cars in the UK rather than the US. The Department of Trade and Industry said yesterday: 'We have made an offer and we are discussing the details.' Ford, which took over the UK carmaker for Pounds 1.6bn at the end of 1989, has for the past couple of years been preparing a project to build a range of smaller Jaguar sports saloons. A formal decision is not expected until next year. The car, code-named X200, would be an addition to the Jaguar range and would more than double output to more than 100,000 a year by 1998-99. The car is planned for launch in 1998. The government was forced earlier this year to provide about Pounds 9.5m in selective regional aid to persuade Ford to build another car, the successor to the Jaguar XJS, at Jaguar's Coventry plants, rather than at a Ford plant in Portugal. That car, codenamed X100, will go into production in the summer of 1996. Mr Alex Trotman, Ford chairman and chief executive, said last week that the Pounds 9.5m 'would pale by comparison' with the aid needed to ensure that the X200 is built in the UK. The range is being developed as a derivative of DEW98, one of Ford's global car projects, which is expected to lead to a new range of executive/luxury cars to be produced in north America, most probably for sale under the Lincoln and Mercury brand names. They would compete with luxury cars from BMW and Mercedes-Benz of Germany and makes such as Toyota's Lexus. The new Jaguar would share the same 'chassis platform' and other components as the other DEW98 cars, but would have a unique body shell and would probably use a new range of Jaguar V8 engines under development that are to be built at Ford's engine plant at Bridgend, south Wales. Mr Trotman said one of Ford's US plants 'could build Jaguars just fine. We have some of the best-quality factories in the world in the US.' The government faces a difficult task to justify the level of financial aid being sought by Ford in the number of new jobs that will be created at Jaguar. Some government officials are understood to be sceptical about the expense of backing the project. International carmakers have become aware that substantial state aid can be gained in Europe from governments eager to maintain car production capacity or to attract new projects. Volkswagen of Germany has recently won promises of state aid from Spanish central and regional governments amounting to several hundred million pounds for the development of future products at Seat, its troubled Spanish subsidiary. In the UK the government has recently provided modest selective regional assistance to Peugeot, the French carmaker, which has added a saloon version of its 306 range to production at its Ryton, Coventry plant.</p>

			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Concern over pension assets A GROUP of 30 Labour MPs yesterday tabled an early-day motion urging British Coal to refrain from any action relating to its pension funds until the social services committee pensions inquiry concludes, David Owen writes. The motion also charged Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, and Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, with incompetence in their dealings with the mining industry. It noted that Mr Rhoslyn Roberts, secretary of the British Coal staff superannuation scheme, considered present safeguards to be inadequate. Meanwhile, Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, yesterday stressed to trustees of the British Rail pension fund that the government had no 'hidden agenda' for stripping the fund of its assets. He said that 'irresponsible speculation' about the future of the pensions after railway privatisation was needlessly worrying BR pensioners. Editorial comment, Page 19</p>

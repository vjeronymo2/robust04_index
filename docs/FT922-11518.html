			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / 1991 Results Season: Companies strive to maintain dividends against the odds DIVIDEND CUTS seemed to be accidents waiting to happen at the start of the results season. Pay-outs on average were covered less than twice by depressed earnings per share, a level lower than in the last recession. Balance sheets had been stretched and cash conservation was a priority. There was no economic upturn to back up a message of confidence and the severity of the recession had increased the prospective level of investor understanding for cuts. In the market, several companies had double-digit yields, indicating that cuts had been discounted. But the abiding impression of recent results is of companies maintaining payments against the odds, particularly in cases where the year's total was uncovered by earnings. Of the FT-SE 100 constituents, 47 reported results for the calendar year 1991. As might be expected, the financial strength of these groups and their spread of businesses, particularly outside the UK, meant less pressure on dividend payments, which tend to be very small compared with both turnover and shareholders' funds. Thirty raised their total payments, 15 held them and only two - Guardian Royal Exchange and Midland Bank - showed overall declines. In both cases the share price responded favourably to news that was less bad than feared. Two other cutters, however, fell out of the FT-SE: Royal Insurance - which surprised the market by paying no final - and Tarmac. Otherwise, the second 100, or Tootsie stocks, in the FT-A All-Share index proved just as loath to cut, with only Vickers and Bunzl joining Royal and Tarmac. However, the numbers holding their total payment equalled those raising it at 18 apiece. The slump in the UK housing market provided a link between the insurance companies, which were hit by mortgage indemnity losses, and the builders, which did produce a series of dividend cuts. Although George Wimpey held its dividend early in the season, the cutters in the construction sector included Costain, which passed its final, Mowlem and Higgs &amp; Hill. Taylor Woodrow said that maintaining the payment out of reserves was 'a simple it matter of honour' because of the intention it had stated at the time of last April's Pounds 162m rights issue. At least Taylor Woodrow's gearing was moving in the right direction, down from 30 to 23 per cent, whereas Tarmac's increased from 39 to 51 per cent. For those companies maintaining dividends in spite of slashed earnings, or even losses as was often the case in the insurance and construction/property sectors, the key factor was having the cash available to pay. Wimpey, for instance, had brought its debt down by about Pounds 100m through disposals and working capital cuts. Several others - Costain, Amec, Higgs &amp; Hill, Mowlem and Ibstock Johnsen - had joined Taylor Woodrow in replenishing their funds via rights issues. Of these only Amec had net cash at the year-end and it managed a tiny dividend increase. The general pain in the construction-related sectors is reflected in dividend cover of about one for building materials with contracting being uncovered, according to Mr George Hodgson at SG Warburg. He pointed out that to restore cover to an average of 2 to 2.2 over the cycle, companies would have to build up cover to significantly more than that during the good years, which would delay the resumption of dividend growth. So while cuts have been few and far between, dividends could stay flat for a couple more years. When this is added to the two years of minimal rises that have already been a feature of the recession-hit groups, the effect will be that many companies will have gone for four or five years of virtually frozen dividends, rather than take one step down to a base from which the payments can grow again. Mr Paul Myners, chairman of Gartmore Investment Management, said the expectation of modest dividend growth over the next few years was implicit in the market being in the unusual position of yielding more than the rate of inflation. On the other hand, he derived some encouragement from the paucity of dividend cuts in the latest series of results. 'Companies must have looked at their business prospects and their capital requirements and decided that they had the resources to pay.' Even among smaller companies cuts were fewer than feared. The James Capel 'Trixie' index, covering roughly numbers 200 to 600 in the FTA-All Share, showed 23 cuts, 65 holds and 121 rises among the 209 companies reporting 1991 results so far. However, worries remain that reluctance to cut is based more on fear of the effect on the share price, and hence the company's susceptibility to a takeover bid, than on a sounder appraisal of a company's finances and prospects. And the danger of cuts remains for companies facing a second year of uncovered payments. Even those which have conserved cash well during the recession, when there has been less call for working capital, may find it more of a precious commodity on the way out as the level of activity grows.</p>

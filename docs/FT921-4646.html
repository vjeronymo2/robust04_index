			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / International Company News: Perrier battle swings Nestle's way THE labyrinthine struggle between Nestle and Italy's Agnelli family for control of Source Perrier, the French mineral water company, yesterday swung in favour of the Swiss food multinational. A commercial court in Nimes, near Perrier's spring in southern France, ruled that voting rights on a third of the 35.5 per cent Perrier stake owned by Exor, an Agnelli-controlled holding company, must be frozen for two years. The move automatically cuts the Agnelli camp's total votes in Perrier from 49.3 per cent to to 37.5 per cent and is a partial victory for Nestle in one of two crucial court actions it is undertaking to reduce the Italian stake. Perrier's share price rose by FFr28 in response, to close at FFr1,568. Previously, the Agnellis controlled 35.5 per cent of Perrier through Exor - now reduced to 23.7 per cent  - and still hold another 13.8 per cent in Perrier treasury shares bought in January by Saint Louis, the paper and sugar group which they control with Worms et Cie, a family holding group. 'For the first time since the beginning of the conflict, Nestle is in a good position to get control of Perrier,' said Mr Sylvain Massot, European food and beverages analyst at Morgan Stanley International. Exactly how much of Perrier is owned by the Swiss group will not be known until the FFr13.4bn (Dollars 2.3bn) hostile offer it is making for the water group, with Banque Indosuez, closes on March 24. The three-month battle has deeply split the French business establishment. On the Nestle side stand Banque Indosuez and Lazard, the bank which has traditionally dominated the takeover market. Lazard is loyal to BSN, the leading French foods group which is deeply anxious over the Agnellis' ambitions and is trying to force the Italians to negotiate. The Agnellis, once close to Lazard, are backed by Exor, the commercial bank Societe Generale, and the Worms family, a historic commercial dynasty. Nestle did not get all that it wanted from the Nimes court yesterday, in that it had asked the judge to freeze all Exor's voting rights for five years, on the grounds that Exor and its allies had secretly built up control of Perrier against French takeover rules. The Swiss group is trying to annul the sale of the 13.8 per cent Perrier stake to Saint Louis in another legal action, on the grounds that the transaction took place illicitly, in the knowledge that Nestle was about to make an offer at a higher price. That transaction is due for a ruling by the Paris commercial court on March 16, just under a week before Nestle's offer closes. If the Swiss group wins, the Agnelli camp could end up with as little as 32 per cent of Perrier, estimated Mr Massot. Exor said yesterday's ruling was 'regrettable but not a catastrophe'.</p>

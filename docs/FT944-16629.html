			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / International Company News: Intel seeks to stop shipments of AMD chips Intel is seeking an injunction to force rival Advanced Micro Devices to halt shipments of microprocessor chips, following a US court ruling that a small element of the 'microcode' contained in AMD's 486 microprocessors infringes Intel copyright. Intel said AMD must immediately stop making and selling the chips, which are used in personal computers. AMD, however, said that in anticipation of an injunction it had already begun production this week of chips with the infringing microcode expunged. It said it did not expect any disruption to shipments of its 486 microprocessors to PC manufacturers. 'This litigation is simply another effort by Intel to limit competition in the 486 microprocessor market,' said Mr W. J. Sanders III, AMD chairman and chief executive officer. 'It must not succeed.' The copyright dispute is the latest development in almost a decade of legal battles between Intel, the world's largest chip maker, and AMD, its former technology partner. AMD sells microprocessors that emulate Intel's designs. The copyright infringement ruling covers a very small portion of a microprocessor microcode used for in-circuit emulation, or debugging of software. AMD said the code was 'superfluous'. The ruling applies only to this portion of microcode and 'does not affect jury verdicts returned earlier this year upholding AMD's right to manufacture and sell microchips containing Intel microcode', AMD said. Intel charged, however, that AMD had deliberately used Intel microcode. Being 'compatible with Intel technology was so critical to AMD's strategy that AMD copied the ICE code, after it had specifically given up any rights to do so', said Mr F. Thomas Dunlap, Intel vice-president and general counsel. AMD will ask the court for 'reasonable time to change our production lines', said Mr Sanders. The production cycle for microprocessors is about 12 weeks, so it will be several weeks before the new chips are available. AMD will also have to destroy up to 100,000 chips that it has in inventory, Mr Sanders said. AMD expects to ship between 1m and 1.2m microprocessors in the current quarter. 'While we are not giving up our rights to appeal, we are looking at the decision as final,' said Mr Sanders.</p>

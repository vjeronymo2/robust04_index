			<p><P> May 27, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JOYNER-KERSEE TO RUN 400-METER HURDLES TODAY  </P> <P> Jackie Joyner-Kersee, the Olympic gold medalist in the heptathlon and long  jump, is now looking for new worlds, or rather events, to conquer.  </P> <P> The multi-event specialist has designated the 400-meter hurdles as her  individual event of the year.  </P> <P> She will make her season debut in that race today in the Bruce Jenner Bud Light  track and field meet at San Jose City College.  </P> <P> Joyner-Kersee is the co-American record-holder in the 100-meter hurdles at  12.61 seconds. Now she's stretching out to the longer hurdles race.  </P> <P> Even though she hasn't devoted much training time to the 400-meter hurdles  previously, there are indications that Joyner-Kersee could be a top-ranked  American if she has enough competition at that distance.  </P> <P> Last year, while training for the Olympics in the heptathlon and long jump, she  still managed to record a time of 55.74 to rank 10th among U.S. women in the  400-meter hurdles.

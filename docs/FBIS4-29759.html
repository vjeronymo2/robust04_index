			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 21 KYODO -- Japanese companies  continued to regain their business confidence in the April-June  period by comparison with the preceding quarter, according to  results of a survey released by the Finance Ministry on Tuesday  [21 June].    The business survey index (BSI) stood at minus 7.7 among  major corporations, based on research conducted in May. The  figure marks a 4.7 point improvement from the previous survey  and the second quarter in a row that the sentiment has picked up.    The index is the difference of between the percentages of  those saying conditions have improved and those claiming it has  not.    A Finance Ministry official said he expects further  improvement in the future.    The survey found that business confidence among small and  medium-sized companies is also growing.    Major companies' expectations for the July-September period  yield a positive index of 0.2, while those of medium-sized firms  give a positive index of 1.9 for the final quarter this year.    Companies expected an average 1.7 percent increase of sales  in fiscal 1994 and a 16.0 percent rise of pretax profit.    The survey also showed the labor surplus easing for the  first  time since February 1991.    The research covered 10,816 companies capitalized at 10  million yen or more, excluding financial institutions and  insurance concerns. Valid responses were received from 9,187  firms.</p>

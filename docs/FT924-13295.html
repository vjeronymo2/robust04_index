			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Pounds 19m price tag on Linx Printing LINX PRINTING Technologies, one of a clutch of UK companies which dominate the continuous inkjet printing business, is coming to the market through a placing valuing it at Pounds 18.8m. Some 3.62m shares are being placed with institutions at 130p. Of the total, about 1.54m are new shares, and the rest existing shares being sold by directors, their family trusts and Paribas, an institutional shareholder involved in the initial funding of the company. The company's advisers yesterday poured cold water on the idea that a higher striking price had been anticipated, arguing that Linx p/e ratio should be at a slight premium to that of Domino, the UK and European market leader. Domino was trading at a p/e of 15.2 yesterday; at 130p, Linx' historic p/e is 15.5. Dealings should start on October 22. The company will receive Pounds 1.3m after expenses. Linx said it sought a listing principally to gain access to financial markets. It was anxious to acquire complementary businesses and it believed a number of possibilities may become available. The company made pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.65m in the year ended June 30 1992, a 79 per cent increase, on sales up 62 per cent at Pounds 10.47m. Continuous inkjet printing produces images of lower quality than office inkjet ('drop-on-demand') printing, but at speeds compatible with modern production lines.</p>

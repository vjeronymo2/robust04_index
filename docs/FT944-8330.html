			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / Swifter payment of bills reported The length of time taken to settle bills for small and medium sized businesses has improved in the last four years, the Confederation of British Industry said yesterday. But late payment is still a 'major headache' for many businesses, and the smallest companies are worst hit by the problem. A survey of 400 small and medium sized companies by the CBI and Coopers &amp; Lybrand found that the average payment time for bills was 52.8 days. This compares with an average payment time of 60 days in 1990, and is considerably better than the European Union average of 66 days, according to the European Commission. The CBI pointed out that improvement in the late payment record partly reflects improvements in the overall business climate. It suggested, however, that the improved results might also reflect a shift in business practices, with 62 per cent of firms now using credit control managers compared with only 49 per cent in 1990. Mr Chris Hughes, head of insolvency at Coopers &amp; Lybrand, said: 'The improvement suggests that credit management techniques in small and medium sized firms have been strengthened.' Nevertheless, Mr John Parsons, chairman of the CBI's smaller firms council, warned that late payment remained a problem. The survey showed that 11 per cent of companies said that late payment was threatening their survival, compared with 17 per cent in 1990. Nearly half of the companies said that more than 40 per cent of invoices were paid late, and over a fifth said that more than 60 per cent were late payments.</p>

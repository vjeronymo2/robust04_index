			<p>941108 FT  08 NOV 94 / UK's first Atlantic oilfield wins development go-ahead Development of Britain's first offshore oilfield in the deep Atlantic waters west of the Shetland Islands was given the go-ahead by the government yesterday. British Petroleum and Shell plan to spend Pounds 550m on developing Foinaven, the first field in a region that preliminary drilling results suggest may contain 4bn barrels of oil. When fully developed, the region could produce up to a third of Britain's present North Sea output of 2.5m barrels a day. However, the field is in 450 metres of water and in a region, known as the Atlantic Frontier, where weather can be harsher than in the North Sea and sub-surface currents more complex. As a result, production will not be from fixed platforms of the type used in the North Sea. Foinaven's oil will be fed into a large ship, a production and storage unit, moored over the sea-bed wells. The ship will feed a shuttle service of tankers. Production at Foinaven is scheduled to start by the end of next year. British contractors have so far won 72 per cent of the work for developing the field, amounting to some Pounds 400m of the Pounds 550m likely to be spent. Other western European-based companies have won another 20 per cent. Announcing the go-ahead yesterday, Mr Tim Eggar, industry and energy minister, said the development would require 'novel approaches' from the oil industry if the region was to reach its full potential. Mr Eggar also signalled that the government would like a co-operative approach to any pipeline project in the area in order to control costs. The minister said oil industry interest in the region had been unprecedented. Eighteen companies had bid for one of the blocks, the largest number of bidders for any one area. Although exploration is still at an early stage, a report by oil companies identified 11 possible sites for development between 1995 and 2010 at a cost of Pounds 9.5bn. The report concludes that if the eventual reserves proved large enough, a joint pipeline might result in considerable savings on operating expenses. It might also lead to higher recovery rates, according to Mr Norman Smith, managing tor of Smith Rea Energy Associates, one of the report's authors. BP said that the bulk of spending in the North Sea went into fixed platforms. But Foinaven's floating production facility would account for just 35 per cent of spending. New methods of drilling and the complex subsea wells would account for 35 per cent and 30 per cent respectively.</p>

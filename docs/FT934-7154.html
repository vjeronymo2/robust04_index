			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / Property (The Deep South): Georgia on my mind - The delights of small-town America LUCKILY, Sherman did not destroy all Georgia on his march. Washington, Madison and Newnan are attractive small towns that survived, where some antebellum (pre-civil war) houses have also escaped 20th century development. Madison is small-town America at its best. A prosperous staging post on the old route from Charleston to New Orleans, it was the centre of plantations for 60 miles around. Long, hooting goods trains still carry Georgia pines through town, and the drugstore has kept its soda fountain. Main Street looks smart, perhaps helped by the Georgia Main Street Project (a civic trust type of scheme). There is a lively cultural centre and a Japanese plant makes compact discs. But the Japanese live out of town by themselves. It is their loss as Madison has splendid houses. For example, 411 Academy Street, built in 1848, is a classic late Georgian house, with the customary twin parlours (for men or women), and high ceilings for summer heat. It does not have central air conditioning, but an old-style attic fan cools the house in minutes. Its two-acre lot is itching for a serious gardener. The price from Baldwin Realty is Dollars 498,500. Property tax is far cheaper than in Atlanta an hour away. Two blocks away, 498 South Main Street is a treasure house of expensive Victorian architecture, 'the most elegant country home in middle Georgia', according to The Madisonian in 1883, with joinery rich in contrasting woods  -black walnut and maple floors, walnut sliding doors, and walnut and ash mouldings. Italian craftsmen stencilled the ceilings. The house, lovingly restored, comes with 10 acres for Dollars 2.25m, from Jenny Pruitt. The Victorian Society should charter an aircraft at once to visit, continuing to Newnan (25 minutes from Atlanta airport) where Fisher Realty offers another Victorian extravaganza. 155 Greenville Street of 1886 is painted in colour combinations we know on the Victorian bridges over the Thames. The price is Dollars 795,000. A classic antebellum Greek Revival house with a columned balcony and porch is 52 College Street, with 12 ft high ceilings downstairs and 10 ft upstairs. Although it became apartments during the Depression, it is now in excellent condition. Pressure-washing twice a year, to remove mildew and dirt from the white outside paint, has meant no painting for seven years. Harry Norman asks Dollars 475,000. Macon, south of Atlanta, is a small city once more important than Atlanta. A Victorian house re-done (superbly) in 1911 by Neel Reid as a Parisian villa is 397 College Street. In the College Hill historic district, it costs Dollars 525,000 from Sheridan Solomon Kernaghan. The agent also offers an imposing Greek Revival house (1837) with its columned porch rising from a stepped podium. 1231 Jefferson Terrace costs Dollars 385,000. A Victorian gem, this time unusually in brick with stone banding, is 1144 Georgia Avenue, for Dollars 10,000 more from Murphey Taylor &amp; Ellis. The quail-shooting season is starting on the plantations at Thomasville in south Georgia. Some owners buy quail to release them, but it is generally rough sport. 'I don't like contrived shooting', said plantation-owner Russell Chubb, of realtor Chubb Associates. The town found fame when rich northerners came for the winter (before the railways were extended into Florida), as the air was good for their health, and soon were building their own grand plantation houses. Mrs Parker Poe, known as Miss Pansy, lived at Pebble Hill (now a museum) until recently with an estate staff of 75 to 100 in an ordered style that only royalty emulates. Devoted to pursuit of the fox and any other outdoor activity, even alligator hunting, she stuffed the house with fox and horse icons. The best is a picture of Eclipse by Sartorius. It is hard to buy a plantation at Thomasville as the families keep them as sporting estates and for their timber business. But Melrose is for sale with  -sadly or fortunately - only 30 acres as the family retained the land and built themselves new houses. There is no lack of outbuildings, however. The brick stable block would grace the blue grass country in Kentucky. Showboat, the estate theatre, where reputedly Gone with the Wind was shown for the first time, is included in the sale. Looking like a showboat tied to the river bank, it was built of swamp cypress wood in 1928. On Friday nights the gentry came for movies, on Saturdays, the staff. Chubb is selling Melrose for Dollars 1.5m. The outbuildings could easily be let. In town Chubb offers 920 Blackshear Street, a 1933 winter residence enlarged in 1977. In tip-top condition, it has the best swimming pool and pool house/guest house that I saw in Georgia - and garaging for six cars. Good for entertaining or as a retreat, it costs Dollars 970,000. At the other end of Georgia across the border into North Carolina is Highlands in the Blue Ridge Mountains, a hill station with pines, rocks and tin roofs where people came from Atlanta, New Orleans and Charleston in the summer. Now it has a year-round population and a famous golf course at the country club. By a lake next to the 18th hole is Brigadoon (Harry Norman, Dollars 2.85m).

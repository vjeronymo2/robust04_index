On arrival, the Prime Minister will be received by Air Chief  Marshal Farooq Feroze Khan. The Prime Minister will also take a  round of the PAC and inspect the overhaul and engineering  facilities there.    F-7P, a Chinese aircraft, is the larest addition to PAF's  inventory. The ceremony will herald a new era of technological  advancement and technical cooperation between Pakistan and China.    F-7P is a Chinese-built version of Soviet MIG-21. Its basic  capabilities have been enhanced with improved fire control and  avionics systems to meet specific PAF sources.    F-7P aircraft has been inducted into PAF to augment its  fleet  of interceptor aircraft against threats of adversaries.    The F-7 Rebuild Factory was established in 1972. It rolled  out its first F-6 fighter in 1981, while its trainer version  FT-6 was rebuilt in 1985. Later on, its capability was enhanced  to rebuild FT-5 in 1987 and A-5III in 1988. The factory is now  rebuilding all Chinese origin aircraft on PAF's inventory.    This is also the first time that the aircraft rebuilding has  been taken up in the country. This has not only reduced the  burden on economy but also increased the technical maturity of  the work force.    The F-6 Rebuild Factory, which is also rebuilding the F-7s,  has successfully rebuilt more than 294 Chinese origin aircraft  of various types for the PAF since its establishment. It also  makes some 10,000 aparts of F-6s, FT-6s, FT-5s and A-5IIIs for  maintenance of these aircraft.    The factory has also produced 500 and 800 line supersonic  auxiliary tanks for the F-7s. They are in addition to the 1,140  line auxiliary tanks which the factory has already made for the  F- 6s. These tanks are installed externally to increase the  endurance and range of the aircraft.    The first F-7P was taken up for overhaul by the factory in  April, 1993. The basic infrastructure for the overhaul was  already available and only a few additions for the overhaul of  F-7 have been made.    The PAC comprises F-6 Rebuild Factory, Mirage Rebuild  Factory, Aircraft Manufacturing Factory and Kamra Avionics and  Radar Factory.    The Mirage Rebuild Factory is actively engaged in rebuilding  the French Mirage aircraft and overhauling Praff &amp; Whitney  F-100-200 engines for the F-16s.    More than 25 of the ex-Australian Mirages which PAF acquired  in what may be called as "the deal of the decade" have also been  produced by this factory. The Aircraft Manufacturing Factory is  engaged in co-production of Karakoram-8 Aircraft with Chinese  collaboration, apart from manufacturing the MFI-17 (Mushshak)  aircraft of Swedish origin. Though not too old, the Kamra  Avionics and Radar Factory is presently rebuilding ground radars  for the PAF.</p>

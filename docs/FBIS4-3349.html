			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Yuan Baohua (5913 1405 5478) at the </F> "International Symposium on the Contracted Responsibility System  of the Shougang Corporation" at the Shougang Corporation on 16  October 1993: "State Enterprises Must Properly Solve the  Problem of Mixing Government Administration With Enterprise  Management"]    [Text] I am greatly interested in this symposium because  this is the first time that an international symposium on the  enterprise contract system has been held in China. The fact  that the contract system of the Shoudu Iron and Steel  Corporation has aroused the interest of famous professors and  entrepreneurs at home and abroad indicates that the contract  system is of positive significance not only in China, but also  around the world. In particular, the contract system of the  Shoudu Iron and Steel Corporation has given brilliant answers to  some issues of a general character which are faced by both  Chinese and foreign enterprises.    In my opinion, the current international symposium has been  successful. The success lies in the consensus reached by the  participants on several important issues concerning how  enterprises should be properly run.  <H5>  1. The Management Ideology of Men Being the Foundation </H5> [subhead]    At present, various countries realize that the fundamental  factor of running enterprises properly rests in fully releasing  the initiative of staff and workers. Both the theory of "taking  people as the foundation" proposed by the Shoudu Iron and Steel  Corporation and that of "behavioral science" put forward by the  Western countries are primarily aimed at fully releasing the  initiative, wisdom, and creativity of staff and workers. This  is a common understanding and is also the most important  hallmark of modern enterprise management. Therefore, an  enterprise that fails to release the initiative of its staff and  workers cannot be called a modern enterprise, and an enterprise  system under which the initiative of staff and workers cannot be  released is not worthy of the name of a modern enterprise  system. This concept is accepted by more and more people in  China and the world. The more modern an enterprise is, the more  necessary it is to fully release the initiative of its staff and  workers. The view that the more modern the technology and  equipment in an enterprise, the smaller the role of men,  obviously does not accord with the trend of the times.    An important point of the management ideology that men are  the foundation is reflected in the participation in enterprise  policy decisions by staff and workers. In order to release the  initiative of staff and workers, it is necessary to enhance  their "awareness of being masters of the country." To enhance  such awareness, it is necessary to let them assume the role of  "masters." In the boards of supervisors in German enterprises,  half of the members are representatives of staff and workers,  who, being masters of half the enterprises, are directly  participating in and supervising major policy decisions of the  enterprises. The system of a workers' representative conference  practiced in the Shoudu Iron and Steel Corporation also allows  staff and workers to directly participate in and supervise  enterprise policies. This is an important foundation leading to  the success achieved by the Shoudu Iron and Steel Corporation.  Therefore, the participation in and supervision of enterprise  policies by staff and workers have become a significant trend of  modern enterprise management. It is also an important yardstick  for measuring whether an enterprise is practicing a modern  enterprise system.  <H5>  2. State-Owned Enterprises Should Properly Resolve the </H5> Issue of Mixing Up Government Administration With Enterprise  Management    The issue of mixing up government administration with  enterprise management in making policy decisions universally  exists in state- owned enterprises all over the world, which is  the root cause of low efficiency and poor performance in  state-owned enterprises. Owing to the failure of resolving this  issue, an upsurge of privatization was set off around the world.  In China, it is necessary to develop the private economy, but  it is impossible to let all enterprises privatize. Likewise, it  is impossible for all state-owned enterprises in various  countries to privatize at present. Hence, we should  conscientiously study the knotty problem of mixing up government  administration with enterprise management. The Shoudu Iron and  Steel Corporation has made a breakthrough in resolving this  problem by practicing a contract system, and the key of the  breakthrough rests in the rational definitions regarding the  relationship between enterprises and government in terms of  responsibility, power, and benefit, so that the ownership and  management right of state assets are really separated. As a  result, the Shoudu Iron and Steel Corporation is robust in its  independent operation. In fact, it is not difficult to separate  the ownership from management rights in the private economy, but  it is very difficult to do this in the state-owned economic  sector. The contract system practiced in the Shoudu Iron and  Steel Corporation is a useful experiment, and it can be called a  new contribution that the enterprise has made.    3. The Incentive Mechanism in Enterprises    International experience shows that the incentive mechanism  in private enterprises refers to the property mechanism and  market mechanism. However, this incentive mechanism is chiefly  effective for owners and operators, and not for staff and  workers. Recently, a new wage system was introduced in Britain,  under which the employers of industrial and commercial  enterprises no longer pay all the originally fixed wages to  staff and workers. Instead, they pay only two-thirds of their  wages, while the remaining one-third is linked to the profits of  enterprises and their amounts are decided by the size of  enterprise profits. Thus, the mechanism of distribution linked  to performance is introduced into the labor market in  determining laborers' wages. This change has shown that the  incentive mechanism in enterprises is developing in the  direction of mobilizing the enthusiasm of owners, operators, and  workers. The success of the distribution system of the Shoudu  Iron and Steel Corporation lies in its reflection of mutual  existence and common prosperity of the interests between  government, enterprises, staff, and workers. This is an  orientation for both state-owned and private enterprises.    The Shoudu Iron and Steel Corporation is an example of  China's enterprise reform, and the contract system is a focal  point of the reform in which "the contract is regarded as a  foundation," as people in the Shoudu Iron and Steel Corporation  put it. The contract system and the complete set of measures  relating to it practiced in the corporation is of universal  significance to enterprise reform in China. Just as Mr. Chao  Yao-tung from Taiwan said in his thesis presented to the  symposium, "it was necessary to thoroughly put into practice the  spirit of the contract system," and "since the spirit of the  contract system implies independent operation,  self-accumulation, self-transformation, and self- development,  and advocates separating ownership from management rights, then  the owners of enterprises should give full and complete  authority to the managers." Of course, there is still something  imperfect in it. That is why we should adopt a positive  attitude to making it perfect. What needs emphasizing is that,  taken from a development point of view, the perfection of the  contract system must be connected with the institution of a  modern enterprise system. That means the two systems should be  joined together, and this calls for carrying out in-depth reform  in various aspects, including the system of ownership and  management rights, the system of organization, the system of  management, and so on, and genuinely establishing an operational  mechanism which is suited to the requirements of a socialist  market economy. No operational mode is invariable. The  ever-developing market economy always calls for us to constantly  accept new things and quicken the pace of reform. An important  aspect of the modern enterprise system is to practice a  joint-stock system in enterprises and set up limited liability  companies. As a matter of fact, a contract system does not  reject a joint-stock system, and they are compatible. The model  of "combining the contract system with the joint-stock system,"  initiated by the Shoudu Iron and Steel Corporation, is the best  proof of it. In this sense, its contract system bears a  scientific and modern character to a certain extent.</p>

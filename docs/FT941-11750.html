			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / HK property prices undaunted by 1997: Simon Holberton on a new surge in values Hong Kong is on the verge of overtaking Tokyo as the most expensive property market in the world, as a new surge in prices for land and buildings feeds through to rents. In January alone property deals totalling more than HKDollars 20bn (Pounds 1.7bn) were executed. This included two hotels on the Kowloon peninsula, at HKDollars 2bn apiece, and a luxury housing development on Hong Kong island for HKDollars 2.2bn. The trend looks like continuing. On Tuesday, Wing On International, a retailer and financial services group, started February off with the sale of two of its centrally-located office towers to a private developer for HKDollars 2.2bn. It is all further evidence - if it were needed - that investors believe Hong Kong has a secure future after 1997. 'One simply can't pay the prices being paid now if one had a short-term view,' says Mr Michael Greene, property analyst at Warburg Securities. Many of the properties that have been sold since the beginning of this year are for re-development. But even in Hong Kong it takes time to pull down one building and put up another. Developers are betting that Hong Kong will remain business-friendly after China resumes sovereignty. The deals also point to continued upward pressure on office and housing rents. According to figures compiled by Brooke Hillier Parker, a property consultant, Hong Kong has the highest rents for retail space - at an average of HKDollars 545 a sq ft - in the world and is second only to Tokyo in rents for office and industrial space. Already big companies, such as Shell, the oil group, Apple, the computer company, and American Telephone and Telegraph have moved out of Hong Kong's central business district to Causeway Bay, beyond the old red-light district of Wan Chai to the east. Office rentals rose on average 19 per cent last year and, with fresh supply of new offices some years off, rents are expected to rise for the next three years at least. The same is true of the housing market, where prices have doubled and transactions have risen threefold in the past three years. It is not limited to the so-called 'high end' of the market - a house on Victoria Peak sold for HKDollars 120m last month - but is also true of the market for family flats. According to figures compiled by Morgan Stanley, the US securities house, transactions in the market for typical properties of between 600 sq ft and 800 sq ft rose to about 15,000 a month in 1991-93 from 5,000 a month between 1985 and 1990. Prices for flats rose to more than Dollars HK2,500 a sq ft by the end of last year from Dollars HK1,250 in 1990. Mr Peter Churchouse, head of research at Morgan Stanley in Hong Kong, says property prices are supported by steeply negative real interest rates, an artificial market in land where the government controls the supply of new land allowed on to the market, and a powerful banking sector which through credit policy can influence prices and rents. The colony's monetary authorities have kept Hong Kong's interest rates pegged to those of the US as part of the policy of linking the currency to the US dollar. Given Hong Kong's average inflation rate over the past year of about 10 per cent this has produced negative real interest rates of around 5 per cent - a strong spur to speculation. 'Investors have a US dollar hedge and they are not paying for Hong Kong's inflation by holding a depreciating currency,' Mr Churchouse says. On credit policy, the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank and its affiliate Hang Seng Bank recently said they would limit mortgages for luxury flats to 50 per cent of the asking price. Analysts say this may place a cap on luxury flat prices but rents will continue to rise because of the shortage. Mr Churchouse points out that conditions today are different from those in 1980/81, when Hong Kong had its last big crash in property prices. At the time interest rates were at 17 per cent, the world was in recession and prime office rentals had risen by 90 per cent a year for three successive years.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- HONG KONG PROPERTY: BOOM TIME  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- International rents (HKDollars/sq. ft/month: 1 Nov 1993)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Offices                 Shops                 Industry  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Tokyo           86.0    Hong Kong       545   Tokyo          23.0 Hong Kong       62.0    Tokyo           232   Hong Kong      17.0 Berlin          38.0    New York        231   Singapore      11.5 Paris           37.0    Munich          189   Lisbon         10.5 Beijing         36.5    Geneva          181   Geneva         10.0 Geneva          36.0    Seoul           177   London         10.0 Frankfurt       34.0    London          170   Paris           8.5 Singapore       34.0    Berlin          167   Zurich          8.3 London          31.0    San Francisco   167   Bristol         8.3 Shanghai        30.0    Paris           165   Berlin          7.4  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Brooks Hillier Parker  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

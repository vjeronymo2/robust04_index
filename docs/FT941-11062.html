			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / Wounded Bosnians ferried to Germany Bosnians wounded in a Sarajevo mortar attack that killed 68 people landed at a US airbase in Germany last night for treatment in an American military hospital, Reuter reports from Ramstein. Military officials said about 150 people, both wounded civilians and family members, were on the two US air force transporters and a Red Cross aircraft. US officials said they had no immediate information on how many of the evacuees were injured. 'They were very, very hungry. We had boxed lunch meals that we shared with them,' an Air Force nurse said. Another US nurse said most of the wounded on her flight were in stable condition, aged between 25 and 30 and suffering from shrapnel wounds, broken bones or amputations. Nearly 200 people were wounded when a mortar bomb hit a crowded Sarajevo open-air market on Saturday, the worst single massacre of the Bosnian war. President Bill Clinton ordered the airlift. Britain has also offered to take some casualties and has sent a medical team to join another airlift this week of the mortar attack victims. The Bosnian government declared a day of mourning, while families laid flowers at the marketplace. Most of the damage had been cleared. Sarajevo Mayor Muhamed Kreselvjakovic said: 'This was the worst day of death in this city for 500 years.' Mr Alija Izetbegovic, Bosnian president, appealed to world leaders to help save Moslems from 'slow-motion genocide'. He blamed Serb gunners for the attack. The Bosnian Serbs, denying responsibility for attacks on Friday and Saturday, have accused the Moslems of massacring their own people to scupper peace talks.</p>

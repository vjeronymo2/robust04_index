			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / Indonesia cracks down on press The Indonesian government yesterday banned three leading publications in what amounts to its most severe crackdown on the media in years. The ban is a reversal of the government's pledge over the past year to stimulate more public debate. The weekly magazines, Tempo and Editor, and the weekly tabloid newspaper, Detik, have been lost their licences to publish following critical reporting of the government's acquisition of a fleet of former East German warships and articles speculating about a successor to President Suharto. However, Mr Subrata, director-general of press and graphics, said Editor and Detik had been banned because of administrative reasons. With a circulation of more than 450,000, Detik is by far the most popular of the three. Tempo, a pro-establishment journal, has a circulation of 200,000, while Editor sells 87,000 copies a week. In the last week Mr Suharto is reported to have accused the media of playing one party against the other on the case of the purchase of the East German warships. The purchase was organised by Mr JB Habibie, minister for technology and research and a Suharto protege, but was opposed by the military. Last week, Indonesia announced that its year-old period of unprecedented openness would continue, but warned journalists to adhere to what it called ethical reporting after recent coverage of politics drew fire from senior officials. Under Indonesian press laws, the Information Ministry can revoke the licence of publications. The last ban was in 1990 when the Monitor tabloid published an article considered blasphemous to Moslems. Diplomats and activists said the move was aimed at muzzling the more outspoken of the country's revitalised media.</p>

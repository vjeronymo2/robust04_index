			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / International Company News: Pechiney International sees 'clear improvement' PECHINEY International, one of the world's largest packaging companies, yesterday forecast a 'clear improvement' in 1992 from last year's group net profit of FFr582m (Dollars 110m). Mr Jean Gandois, chairman of the group, a subsidiary of Pechiney, the state-controlled aluminium maker, said profits were down slightly in the first half but that there would be a very significant net profits recovery in the second six months. Just how big the recovery will be depends on the strength of drink can sales in the summer and the value of the dollar, he told the annual shareholders' meeting. He expected operating profits, FFr3.3bn last year, to remain stable after a rise in packaging profits and a fall in contributions from Howmet, the group's aerospace components division. There will be a fall of between FFr350m and FFr400m in interest charges, thanks to a reduction in debts from FFr15.2bn to FFr9.1bn, according to a report issued at the meeting. The debt repayments are due to the recent sale of aluminium and metal trading assets to the Pechiney parent and the forthcoming conversion of warrants. No large takeovers were planned in the short term, said Mr Gandois, but the group would not hesitate to raise fresh equity next year if needed to fund investment. Rhone-Poulenc-Rorer, the pharmaceutical unit of the French state-owned chemicals group, yesterday said it was in line to meet analysts' forecasts of a Dollars 420m net profit for this year. This compares with Dollars 326m net on sales of Dollars 3.8bn in 1991.</p>

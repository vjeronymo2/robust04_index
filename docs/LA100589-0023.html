			<p><P> October 5, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BUILDING CURBS OKD FOR PANORAMA CITY  </P> <P> Development in central Panorama City will be restricted for at least a year  following Los Angeles City Council approval Wednesday of an ordinance aimed at  preventing oversized office buildings and residences.  </P> <P> The temporary ordinance limits the height of buildings to six stories and calls  for extra review of proposals for buildings that mix residential and commercial  tenants.  </P> <P> Proposed by Councilman Ernani Bernardi, the ordinance will give the city  Planning Department time to prepare a permanent version. It includes a  provision for two 180-day extensions.  </P> <P> The area included in the ordinance is bounded by Parthenia Street, Willis and  Lennox avenues, and the Southern Pacific railroad tracks.  </P> <P> Bernardi asked planners to draft the ordinance after discovering that some of  the central area was zoned for buildings as tall as 30 stories or more,  following a city-center concept that caught on in Woodland Hills but not in  Panorama City.  </P> <P> Proposals to build mixed residential and commercial buildings also seemed out  of place in central Panorama City, Bernardi said.  </P></p>

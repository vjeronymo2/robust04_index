			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Jas Fisher to close terminal JAMES FISHER and Sons saw annual profits dive 59 per cent following increased losses from port terminal and agency operations and a reduced contribution from shipping. And the Barrow-in-Furness-based group is to close its profitable terminal at Whitehaven following the decision by Albright and Wilson, the principal user of the facility, to cease the importing and processing of phosphate rock. The pre-tax outcome for the 1991 year - Pounds 1.5m against Pounds 3.63m - came on turnover of Pounds 30.1m (Pounds 29.9m). Despite the outcome at Whitehaven, port operations incurred operating losses of Pounds 1.99m (Pounds 351,000), reflecting 'difficult trading conditions' at the Newhaven and Heysham terminals. The shipping side contributed operating profits of Pounds 3.8m, down from Pounds 4.22m, as the recession led to lower freight rates and fewer bareboat charter commitments. The directors hope that the closure of the Whitehaven terminal, while having an adverse effect on the group, would be offset by improved profitability of the other two facilities. Earnings per share dipped to 5.1p (9.11p) but the final dividend is held at a proposed 3.5p, maintaining the total for the year at 5.5p.</p>

			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / Observer: Porter calling Out goes Christopher Chataway as LBC chairman and in comes Dame Shirley Porter. But the real power behind the throne of London's talk radio station is Lady Porter's son, John, who put together the rescue package. Although he is part of the Tesco supermarket family, Porter junior is very much his own man. After Oxford and a stint with the Boston Consulting Group, he struck lucky in Californian real estate, which helped finance investments in a string of ventures ranging from credit card verification systems to a California winery. A former Bow Group treasurer, he shares his mother's love of Conservative politics. Indeed, now that controversial mama seems set to bow out of that arena, it's not beyond possibility that he'll take over as the family's true blue banner bearer.</p>

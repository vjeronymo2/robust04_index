			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Reuters rises on Globex EXPECTATION of an announ-cement today by Reuters that its Globex dealing system will go 'live' in Chicago lifted the shares 18 to 1141p. Globex, jointly developed by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the Chicago Board of Trade and Reuters, allows trading in listed futures and options when exchanges are closed. Although Reuters refused to comment, analysts said the system had now been successfully tested and a date had been set for Globex to begin operations. An analyst predicted that heavy US buying in Reuters would be stimulated by the development. Retailers please There was some good news at last for the high streets, with Next beating profits forecasts and Tesco coming in with figures at the top end of expectations. Next shares rose 5 to 71p, equalling its 1991-92 high, as the retail group turned a Pounds 40.7m loss into a profit of Pounds 12.3m for the year to January 31. Market turnover was heavy at 8.6m shares. Analysts were looking for profits of around Pounds 7m to Pounds 10m, and were also impressed by the company's forecast that it will pay an interim and final divided in the current year. Next paid a final dividend of 0.75p in the last financial year, after passing the interim and failing to pay a final dividend in the previous year. Tesco turned in a confidence-boosting profit of Pounds 545.5m, up 25 per cent. The shares climbed 4 1/2 to 255 1/2 p on turnover of 7.6m, about double the recent daily average. Supermarket rival J. Sainsbury rose in sympathy by 6 to 386p. Its results are due on May 12. BET retreats Shares in international business services group BET were burdened by a double dose of negative news, which resulted in a decline of 3 to 114p. The first blow was delivered by Cazenove, the company's broker. It was reported to have reduced its dividend forecast for the current year to no more than 7p, down from last year's 13.25p. As the market was digesting the downgrading from Cazenove, overnight reports from the US confirmed that Standard &amp; Poor's, the international credit rating agency, had lowered its rating on BET's Auction Market Preferred (AMP) stock from A to A minus. One London analyst was moved to remark: 'This is confirmation of trading difficulties if any were needed.' It was learnt after the market closed that BET is refinancing Dollars 140m of its Dollars 500m of AMPs through a private placement by National Westminister Bank. Telecoms group Cable and Wireless, 5 down at 523p, was hurt by downgrades as analysts differed over the group's revamped strategy. After Monday's rise and some bullish press and market comments, County NatWest yesterday cut its forecasts, arguing that C and W was still too reliant on the Honk Kong telecoms market to see any additional long-term benefits, while restructuring costs wiped out any short-term relief. County is looking for Pounds 635m pre-tax in 1992, down Pounds 50m. James Capel was also reported to have downgraded its figures. Vodafone Group rebounded, boosted by a buy recommendation by US house Kidder Peabody. The shares gained 6 to 309p. Fuel retailer and lubricants group Burmah Castrol slipped 10 to 517p on losing a US court case against Quaker State Corp over claims involving the qualities of lubricating products. BP receded 2 1/2 to 252p on turnover of 14m shares, with an early bout of strength in the stock, prompted by heavy overnight buying in the US, running into what was described by oil sector specialists as 'a wall of selling from the UK and Europe'. Lasmo lost 3 to 195p. Concern was expressed in some market quarters about the decline in the share price of holiday group Owners Abroad, which has tumbled from 121p on March 2 to close at 89 1/2 p yesterday, a fall of 6 1/2 on the day. The group's report and accounts reached analysts yesterday, giving details of the sale of 690,000 shares by the chairman to a trust group owned by Owners and used for an employee share ownership scheme. Mr Howard Klein sold the shares for 108p last week, the share price closing that day at 105p. There were hints that some leisure specialists had been surprised at the treatment of certain assets in the accounts. Rank Organisation continued to attract buyers ahead of the election, its leisure activities seen as good hedges to a Labour victory. The shares rose 6 to 666p. Tightly-held Boosey &amp; Hawkes forged ahead 40 to 950p after revealing improved profits and dividend payout. An early morning rumour that the takeover terms for Midland Bank had been announced lifted the shares 10 to 345p. Some talk had the offer price at 410p, although expectations continue to focus on the 380p to 400p range. Profit-taking in TSB Group left the shares down 5 at 121p. Chemicals giant ICI continued to attract buying interest on the back of its international portfolio as investors hedged against the possibility of a Labour UK government. The shares climbed 11 to 1258p. In spite of this, house broker Hoare Govett yesterday became the latest to downgrade the group because of difficult first-quarter trading conditions. Hoare now expects Pounds 900m for 1992, down Pounds 140m, although it remains a long-term buyer of the stock. Water issues had a weak tone ahead of tomorrow's UK general election. Wessex lost 4 to 378p, but traders pointed out that the stock outperformed the sector, supported by its joint venture in UK waste disposal with Waste Management International. Investors, however, are looking for yield protection at present, as the political situation outweighs possible future commercial considerations. Waste Management International, part of a US-based group, successfully floated 75m shares in London, representing a 20 per cent stake in the company. The share price rose to around 610p, from an offered level of 585p. Turnover came to 3.9m shares, with dealers reporting good demand from New York. RTZ put on 5 to 574p, boosted by a recommendation from Smith New Court. Analyst Mr Emil Morfett believes the shares to be a good buy because of the company's US dollar exposure and the stock's attraction as a hedge both 'pre and post-election'. Vickers hardened a penny to 137p. Mr Sandy Morris at County NatWest now believes the company will go for an outright sale of its Rolls-Royce Motor Cars subsidiary instead of the partial sale originally intended. Such a sale could see Vickers rise to 170p, Mr Morris said. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1991/92 NEW HIGHS (13).

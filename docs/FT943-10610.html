			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / Two foundation blocks emerge from Congress: The Senate and House versions of healthcare reform bills as deadline for vote approaches Now that separate healthcare reform bills compiled by Senator George Mitchell and Congressman Richard Gephardt are on the table as the basis for debate in the Senate and the House of Representatives next week the outlines of an eventual overhaul of the US health system are starting to emerge. There are many differences between the two bills, and it is still far from certain that any reform will pass Congress. Many Republicans are now arguing that time has already run out for adequate debate this year on a measure of such magnitude. Yet the Mitchell and Gephardt plans have much in common, and if a healthcare reform bill does pass - albeit by the slimmest of margins - these features now appear likely to form its foundation. At the heart of this common ground is a new set of rules for the insurance market: insurers would be required to accept all eligible applicants, and would not be allowed to drop or reduce anyone's coverage, nor increase their premiums, because of their medical record. Community rating, in which premiums can vary only by geographical area, age or family status, would replace the now generally practised system of experience rating, in which insurers set premiums on the basis of their claims experience with an individual or a company. This change would lower health insurance costs for many families and businesses, and would put a stop to the heartbreak stories of people stripped of their insurance just when they need it most, when they or their child develops some crippling, long-term illness. It would, however, probably raise costs for the younger and healthier people who make fewer claims on their health insurance, and economists disagree on whether it would on its own increase the percentage of the US population covered by health insurance. Both the Senate and House bills would also set a national standard benefits package defining which types of care must be covered by any insurance policy, and would increase the benefits the elderly now receive under the government's Medicare programme by improving coverage for long-term care and by reimbursing the cost of prescription drugs. Both would raise the cigarette tax by 45 cents a pack and, in differing ways, broaden access to the programme under which federal government employees now obtain their health insurance. The two bills offer very different approaches to the problem of how to expand healthcare coverage to the estimated 35m to 40m people who have none. The House bill simply requires employers to provide health insurance to their workers and pay for at least 80 per cent of its cost. Senator Mitchell concluded that this employer mandate would not pass the Senate, and his bill holds it in reserve for the year 2002 if his own voluntary system fails to bring 95 per cent of the population into the health net. It would require companies to offer their workers a choice of at least three insurance plans, but would not oblige the employee to accept this offer or the employer to pay any share of its cost. It would, however, offer subsidies to low income individuals to encourage them to buy insurance, and to employers to encourage them to expand health coverage to all their employees. The two plans also offer different safety nets to the unemployed and the poor, though both would abolish the current Medicaid programme. While the House bill fulfils President Bill Clinton's requirement of 'guaranteed universal coverage', the Senate bill's would provide 95 per cent. But Senator Mitchell has received Mr Clinton's general endorsement, and argues that the most important thing is to reverse the trend of coverage, which - excluding the elderly who are covered by Medicare - has dropped from 88 per cent in 1980 to 83 per cent today. One critical difference lies in the two bills approaches to containing medical inflation, which was once the driving force behind efforts to reform the health system. The House bill relies on increased competition between insurers and medical providers to control costs, with, as a standby, a national commission to impose fee schedules if healthcare inflation has not abated. Senator Mitchell, on the other hand, has introduced an already controversial scheme to levy a 25 per cent assessment on expensive health plans whose costs rise by more than a fixed percentage above the rate of general inflation. Because of the different rules of procedure in the two chambers, it is the Senate bill that is likely to be most heavily amended when debate opens, probably next week. It is also the Senate bill which appears to come closest to a lowest common denominator which can pass in both chambers. But with outright opposition from almost all Republicans and continuing doubts from many right-wing Democrats, Senator Mitchell and Mr Gephardt have few votes to play with in their search for a majority.</p>

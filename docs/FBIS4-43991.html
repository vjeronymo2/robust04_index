			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by European Parliament President Egon Klepsch at the </F> EU summit in Corfu -- live]    [Text] Ladies and Gentlemen, it is a special honor for me  as the president of the European Parliament [EP] to pay tribute  from this rostrum to the signing of the documents by which  Norway, Austria, Finland, and Sweden become European Union [EU]  members.    The signing of the acts of accession within the framework of  this meeting of heads of state and chiefs of government has  become possible owing to the overwhelming vote of consent by the  European Parliament on 4 May 1994. At that time, I assessed the  favorable vote in our parliament as a decision of historic  consequence, and I cordially welcomed the future members in the  European Union.    I would like to corroborate this today. You are cordially  welcome. Your membership will strengthen parliamentary  democracy in Europe. The social and democratic model in your  countries, your political culture, your commitment to  unambiguous and openness in policy -- these are the virtues for  which the European Parliament showed its respect by voting for  the accession of the four candidates on 4 May.    Is it not a unique event in the history of the European  Union  and its previous enlargements that the countries that now join  us will be granted transition periods, while the European Union  binds itself to raise the standards of environmental directives  to the standards of the new members within four years?    For the European Parliament, the debate on the enlargement  shortly before the end of the legislative period was probably  the most difficult decision of the past five years. All  deputies were aware of the great political consequence involved.  The delays in the negotiation schedule and the resultant  pressure of time were not caused by the European Parliament.    All the more, we must thank the Greek Presidency, which is  hosting the meeting today, for having made a huge effort to  bring about and ensure the completion of the necessary  documents. It has thereby allowed the European Parliament to  discuss the issue in a matter-of-fact debate. Through this  debate, the broad public has become aware that this parliament  of the European Union has decisive rights and powers and is able  to deal with them in a responsible way.    Our parliament has often demonstrated this by its right of  co-decision on legislative and budgetary problems, even though  it may have done so in a less spectacular and  publicity-effective way.    The European Parliament did not find it easy to make a  decision on the enlargement. The reasons are known and are not  attributable to the new members. The European Parliament was  and is of the opinion that the inner institutional reform of the  European Union should not have been considered of lesser  importance than the enlargement. We have always insisted that  the review of EU institutions, which is necessary for the  functioning of the Community, should take place simultaneously  and in parallel with the membership negotiations. This  criticism applies to our own governments and the EU Council of  Ministers.    Yet, we did give our approval, because we rely on the pledge  made by the chiefs of government, saying that the European  Parliament would be involved, on the basis of absolute equality,  in the work of the preparatory group for the government  conference in 1996, and because we believe that the contribution  of the new member states will be in the sense of strengthening  the democratic structures within the European Union.    With the enlargement of the Union by Norway, Austria,  Finland, and Sweden, the geography of the European Union will  change. The EU area will grow by 50 percent and will extend  beyond the polar circle. For the first time, the European Union  will also have a common border with Russia. This fact alone  symbolizes new tasks for the enlarged Union. In this  connection, I consider it a particularly good sign that the  European Union has also signed the partnership agreement with  Russia today in parallel with the membership acts.    However, the European Union is also facing huge internal  tasks. We can only cope with the crisis of growth and employment  by common effort. A prerequisite for this is a large and strong  European Union whose members are oriented on the common basic  values and convictions of the founding fathers, and which as a  whole is able to win its citizens' confidence anew time and  again.    The fourth direct elections of the European Parliament have  shown how necessary this will also be in the future. The  favorable vote for membership in Austria shows how people can be  won over for this project through comprehensive information.  The newly elected European Parliament will be a reliable  partner on this road -- as of 1995, also with the deputies from  the new member states.    The European Parliament will continue to be the democratic  conscience of the European Union and, soon, the advocate of 370  million citizens who expect this European Union to ensure peace  and freedom, prosperity and health, employment and social  justice.</p>

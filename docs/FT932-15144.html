			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / Record N Sea oil output forecast OIL PRODUCTION by the main countries involved in the North Sea will reach a record level of nearly 5.5m barrels per day in 1995 - a 41 per cent increase on 1991 - according to a report from Mackay Consultants, oil industry analysts. Mackay says output from new oil fields coming onstream mainly in the UK and Norway sectors will more than compensate for declining production in some of the older fields. Mr David Rennie and Mr Tony Mackay say the expected increase is a result of a high level of development work over the last five years. They do not expect a continuing rise after 1995 because the level of such activity is much lower. In their report, Prospects for the North Sea Oil and Gas Industry 1993-95, they say a significant factor in the UK will be the oil industry's reaction to tax changes in last month's Budget, which they expect to lead to a further contraction in exploration drilling. They admit their prediction that UK oil production will peak at 2.5m barrels a day in 1995, to be followed by a slow decline, is in marked contrast to other experts who forecast continuing growth for the rest of the decade.</p>

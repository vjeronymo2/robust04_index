			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / Uprising founders in blood and devastation: The wrecked parliament building INSIDE the once imposing halls and corridors, the scene was of carnage, squalor and hideous destruction. Bullets and shells had raked the walls, smashed down ceilings and made matchwood from doors. With the surrender of the rebels in the White House in the late afternoon, the wounded, some screaming in agony, were being evacuated slowly by medical teams. In the upper chambers, firing went on as the floors were cleared. Suddenly, a huge explosion, bigger than anything before, shook the edifice. An ammunition dump on the ground floor had blown up - whether by design or chance was not clear. The bodies were still being attended to. Two men, one grasping a machine pistol, were curled into each other on the corner of a corridor, the blood still wet from the head and chest wounds that had killed them. Acrid smoke hung in the low corridors, which were almost pitch black in places. Men stumbled in shock through pools of water and blood. From the front doors of the building, a column of surrendering deputies, defenders and staff - many of them women - filed towards the Moscow River, the victorious troops standing to both sides. Many of the defeated were trembling; two of the women crying. They moved heavily and stood still when commanded, before being loaded on to buses and driven away. For the instigators of the revolt, Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the parliamentary speaker, and Mr Alexander Rutskoi, stripped of his vice presidency, the end was ignominious. Witnesses who met them as the troops entered the building spoke of men breathless with fear, desperately suing for their lives. Surrounding them, similarly distressed, were the deputies who had chosen to stand with them, like Mr Sergei Baburin of the Russia Unity group and Mr Oleg Rumyantsev, a former leader of the Social Democrats. The government troops had taken the White House slowly, at an almost leisurely pace, the T72 tanks on and under the bridge across the Moscow River before the parliament slamming round after round into the building, raking the windows with their machine guns. To one side, a detachment of troops was pinned behind a wall for hours, firing at very close range into the windows. From 7am, when the armed personnel carriers and the light tanks moved smartly into position around the building, until the surrender came, the firing was constant, intense and - for the defenders - deadly. The secondary tactic to taking the building was - as General Dmitry Volkogonov, Mr Yeltsin's military adviser, confirmed - to avoid loss of life on the attackers' side. This meant there were many victims within the parliament building. The nine-hour battle attracted a huge crowd of onlookers. The bolder ones surged forward to near the line of fire. The more fearful hung back. Only sporadic attempts were made by the troops to stop them getting closer. The young soldiers manning the tanks periodically snarled at them to get back, but the spectacle was too engrossing to make the prohibition stick. It was clear from midday that the resistance within the White House was barely more than token. Sporadically, a flash of fire would appear at an upper window of the 19-storey building. Invariably, it was answered by heavy machine gun salvos, even shells fired from tanks. Snipers from the mayor's office, recaptured from the parliamentary side earlier, kept up steady fire on the upper windows. Around 5pm it was over. The taking of the White House, never dared by those who staged the August 1991 putsch, was a hellish battle - for those who had grievously miscalculated, or pushed their defiance too far, or who really believed that the principles they espoused were worth facing death. For whatever reason, many found it.</p>

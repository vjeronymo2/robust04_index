			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / Pounds 50m released for FE colleges The government has released Pounds 50m withheld from further education colleges pending settlement of a dispute over lecturers' contracts of employment. Mr Tim Boswell, further education minister, said that all but three of the 463 colleges had now introduced new flexible contracts for lecturers, eliminating guarantees on teaching hours. However, he warned that a similar 'holdback' could be operated next year if the new contracts offered by 'a very small number' of colleges proved insufficiently flexible.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Responses by French President Francois Mitterrand and </F> German Chancellor Helmut Kohl to written questions from Dieter  Schroeder and Serge July; received on 2 and 3 June: "Kohl and  Mitterrand -- a Shared European Belief To Guarantee Peace"]    [Text] To mark the 6 June ceremonies, LIBERATION and the  leading Munich daily SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG requested and were  granted a "three-way" interview with Chancellor Helmut Kohl and  President Francois Mitterrand. It was initially planned that  they would answer the questions asked by our editors Dieter  Schroeder and Serge July during the Mulhouse summit on 30 May.  However, because the two men could not fit it into their  schedules, the Mulhouse interview could not go ahead. We  therefore sent our questions to the offices of both leaders and  received our replies on 2 and 3 June.    [LIBERATION] The world is currently commemorating the  anniversary of one of the major military events of the century  that came one year before the fall of Nazism. What are your  feelings as you witness the ceremonies being held on the beaches  of Normandy?    [Mitterrand] This year's Normandy landings ceremonies are  particularly solemn since we are celebrating their jubilee.  Exactly 50 years ago, an immense fleet bearing the colors of  liberty and democracy returned hope and dignity to the people of  France. The feelings anyone can have on such a day are  appreciation of the nations which took part in this  extraordinary uprising against Nazism, feelings of admiration  for the leaders who organized and successfully conducted  operations of this scale, and finally feelings of deep gratitude  to the courageous men, many of whom sacrificed their lives, who  set foot on Norman soil on that day.    It is natural that those who were the main participants or  witnesses of these events, or those who remain after 50 years,  should want to meet again and pause to reflect at the place  where they lived this episode in history. These are feelings  that everyone can understand. The only purpose of the  ceremonies of 6 June is to respond to this quite legitimate  desire.    [LIBERATION] Do you regret not being able to attend?    [Kohl] Of course not. While everyone has quite naturally  claimed the opposite, I at no time requested an invitation,  because I feel that it would not have been right for Germans to  participate in this event. On this point, President Mitterrand  and I have always been in total agreement.    [LIBERATION] Do you regret the fact that Chancellor Kohl  could not attend?    [Mitterrand] Chancellor Kohl and I have never had a problem  or misunderstanding on this issue. On 6 June, we will be  commemorating an event, and history cannot be rewritten.  Chancellor Kohl and I both considered that the anniversary of  the Normandy landings was not the best occasion to celebrate and  strengthen French-German friendship.    However, everyone in France knows that the defeat of Nazism  enabled the building of a democratic Germany with which we have  developed ties that are closer than with any other country. It  is in this spirit that federal Germany will participate in the  ceremonies of 8 May 1995. Before that date, we will soon have  the opportunity to illustrate the exceptional relations that  exist between our two countries when I visit Heidelberg on 8  June, at the invitation of Chancellor Kohl, to attend the great  French-German festival of youth. On 14 July [Bastille Day], as  I requested, the European Defense Corps will parade along the  Champs Elysees.    [LIBERATION] France and Germany have gone to war three times  since the end of the 19th century. These tragedies are now a  thing of the past. What assurances can you give your peoples to  guarantee this can never occur again?    [Kohl] We Germans border on more European countries than  anyone else. Therefore, our relentless pursuit of a policy for  European unity is precisely a fundamental, if not the main,  issue that shapes our future.    We cannot just take peace and freedom for granted. Each day  we must take steps to ensure them. In my opinion, there can be  no doubt that European unity is precisely the best insurance  against an uprising of nationalism and chauvinism and against  rivalry between powers, including here in the west of Europe.  The success of our plans for the European Union [EU] is finally  a question of war and peace for the 21st century.    [Mitterrand] There is no "fully comprehensive" insurance  policy. First and foremost, everything is a question of will:  the will of the political leaders and the will of the people.  However, it is clear, more so today than yesterday, that  European construction is the best possible guarantee against a  return to this type of confrontation. That is why everyone who,  here or there, through nationalism, nervousness, or selfishness  argues in favor of inward-looking policies, is being very  shortsighted and most unwise. There has never been strength or  peace through disunion.    [LIBERATION] The Normandy landings took place 50 years ago.  How much longer should we continue to commemorate the rifts in  our shared history? Can these references to the past really  serve to consolidate our relations?    [Kohl] I fully understand that the Allies want to  commemorate  these events that were of great significance for the whole of  Europe and to remember their dead. We Germans, too, must  remember this era in our history so that we are sure to learn  the right lessons. On 8 June, President Mitterrand and I will  meet young people from France and Germany in Heidelberg and  stress the joint commitment of our peoples in favor of Europe.  Using an idea of the historian Joseph Rovan, we will invite the  youth of France and Germany to present their shared vision of  Europe in the 21st century. I believe it is important to take  their suggestions and proposals into account in our future work  on continued European integration, especially when the Germans  and French preside the EU. We must ensure that youth plays an  active role in our discussions when we are talking about  European construction, since it is precisely their future of  peace and freedom that is at stake.    [Mitterrand] The history of two great nations, when they are  neighbors, has rarely been a never-ending romance. There are  good memories and bad memories and it would be rather simplistic  to forget the bad things and remember only the good times. The  waters of history run deep and voluntary amnesia, whether by  peoples or individuals, is never a good solution. On the  contrary, it is the accepted past that can feed the political  will I spoke of before. We can only see an apparent paradox in  the fact that the most spectacular coming together, which lies  at the heart of European construction, has been that of France  and Germany, the two countries that have fought the most over  the last century. Here, as elsewhere, time has done its work  and the time will come when we will no longer feel the need to  commemorate events, even ones so memorable.    [LIBERATION] On 6 June 1944 we saw the large-scale  commitment  of the United States in the war against Nazism. This marked the  start of a military presence in Europe, and especially in  Germany, which continues to this day. What military role should  the Americans play in Europe now?    [Kohl] The alliance with the democracies of North America  and  the presence of the Americans in Europe remains, and will remain  in the future, for us Europeans, the most obvious expression of  shared transatlantic values and an irreplaceable basis for  keeping Europe on a stable footing of peace and security. On  this point, I welcome the fact that President Clinton has  renewed his commitment to keep 100,000 American military  personnel stationed in Europe. With the EU, an effective  alliance is an essential precondition to bring the new  democracies of Central and Eastern Europe closer to the  organizations of the West and to ensure general and lasting  peace for the whole of Europe.    [Mitterrand] The vigor of the alliance with the United  States  and its European partners remains an essential part of our  security, and the United States' military commitment in Europe  is the very expression of the transatlantic link. This is why  during the debates that have been held over the years on the  development of NATO, I have always advocated that nothing be  done that could divert the Atlantic Alliance from its basic  mission, namely guaranteeing the security of its members.    Of course, this must not discourage Europeans from jointly  building up a European defense system. It seems to me that we  have made progress in this area. The creation of the Eurocorps  is a significant step forward in this respect. The desire to  develop the role of the Western European Union (WEU) is also a  move in the same direction. At the last Atlantic Alliance  summit in January I felt that our American and Canadian friends  realized that, far from weakening the Alliance, this desire of  the Europeans to assume their responsibilities in the areas of  security and defense was, on the contrary, the best guarantee  they could have of counting on genuinely determined allies in  the long term, as set out in the preamble to the North Atlantic  Treaty, "to safeguard the freedom of their peoples, their common  heritage, and their civilization."    [LIBERATION] Under joint impetus from you both, France and  Germany decided to create a European Army Corps. In your  opinion, will the Eurocorps be the embryo of a European army?    [Kohl] With the creation of the European Corps, President  Mitterrand and I intended -- as we have since the beginning --  to place close French-German cooperation in a Europe  perspective. Since then, Belgium has responded positively to our  invitation, which was sent to the member states of the WEU, to  participate in the European Corps. Negotiations for Spain's  entry are under way. Consequently, the European Corps, which  should be fully established by 1995, is already a successful  model for a European military structure, thanks to which both  the European pillar of the Alliance and the WEU will be  strengthened. It could therefore serve as an example for other  large European units in a EU that is in the process of becoming  integrated. I am especially pleased with President Mitterrand's  gesture. He invited German, French, and Belgian soldiers from  the Eurocorps to march in Paris during the traditional parade on  14 July to mark the Bastille day celebrations.    [Mitterrand] My answer is obviously "yes." Will the embryo  keep developing until it leads to the birth of a European army?  That remains to be seen. However, I feel that there is no  doubt at all about the fact that the gradual emergence of a  genuine European defense identity, having the required resources  and placed at the service of a joint policy, will be the  touchstone of EU success in the long term.    [LIBERATION] On 7 May, you suggested that the aircraft  carrier Charles de Gaulle "ensures France's place in a future  European Navy." Are you suggesting the birth of an integrated  European squadron based on the Eurocorps model?    [Mitterrand] Indeed, it seems to me that the issue will  arise. In fact it has already started coming up with the  conflict in the former Yugoslavia. On this occasion, it  appeared to the Europeans that it was more simple and effective  to coordinate, within the framework of the WEU, their  participation in the naval embargo control operations. This is  a first step. There will be others and I am very much in favor  of them. What I told you about the European defense identity  also holds true for the navy. Just like we put together the  European Corps with elements from several countries' armies, we  can undoubtedly envision the creation of standing multinational  naval units which will also be the embryo of a future European  navy.    [LIBERATION] President Mitterrand has just suggested that  the  aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle "ensures France's place in a  future European Navy." Would you be prepared to have this ship  participate in an integrated European squadron set up along the  lines of the Eurocorps?    [Kohl] For the naval forces, the multinational aspect and  commitment within an international framework are part of a tried  and tested tradition. For many years now, we have been  maintaining close cooperation in this area with France and with  our partners in the Alliance. In this context I would simply  reiterate that NATO's standing naval intervention units and the  naval forces set up on an ad hoc basis within the WEU have, over  the last few years, contributed primarily toward overcoming  various crises.    We have therefore agreed to develop procedures to be able to  establish a French-German naval unit at any time for joint  missions. Outside the bilateral framework proper, this kind of  temporarily established unit could be placed at the disposal of  NATO or the WEU. This kind of availability on both sides would  correspond to the model supplied by the European Corps and would  be a fresh contribution toward reinforcing the WEU's operational  capability and European commitments within NATO. In this  respect, I understand President Mitterrand's statements as a  sign to legally accentuate Europe's efforts in naval matters.    [LIBERATION] Today's ceremonies have reminded us that the  United States of America plays a crucial role in Europe  politically, economically, culturally, and socially. What is  your assessment of this in the light of this event? Is it  symbolic of current relations between America and Europe?    [Kohl] In the past, during the time of the East-West  conflict, the transatlantic link binding us firmly to the United  States of America and Canada was primarily geared toward matters  of security policy. Today, we are duty-bound to broaden this  link to take in other sectors and, in particular, to intensify  cooperation in the areas of the economy, culture, and science.  It is also important to reinforce exchanges of young people,  thus consolidating ties of friendship between young people on  both sides of the Atlantic.    [Mitterrand] The United States of America occupies an  important place in Europe at all levels. This is the result of  that country's qualities, its dynamism, and its creativity, but  also its economic and financial power, the size of its domestic  market, and the size of its businesses. It is here that we are  faced with stiff competition which is highlighted by the effect  of our own divisions. This is true despite the fact that here in  Europe we have a considerable potential for creativity, whether  in technology, science, culture, the arts, etc. I see in this  yet another reason to work toward reinforcing the EU further.  The dialogue between the United States and Europe will only be  richer and more fruitful for it.</p>

President of the Higher State Council [HCE], Chairman of the  national conference, sisters and brothers. The multifold crisis  that our country is currently experiencing is the result of the  bankruptcy of the management, the political management of the  country during the last decade. The violation of the basic  rules of political management, whether consciously or  unconsciously, for a long time has led to the deterioration of  the state and its apparatus. For over a decade, improvisation,  demagoguery, and manipulation have become part of the system of  government. Moreover, the economic, social, and cultural reform  process, which the country went through during the sixties and  seventies, despite some setbacks, and which was an important  gain for our people, has gradually become a subject of  retraction through illogical and irresponsible acts and behavior.    The weakening, unsettlement, and deterioration of government  have led to its retreat and return to political, economic,  social, and cultural backwardness, as well as to the widespread  absence of security. The security situation that was prevalent  on the eve of the declaration of the state of emergency in most  of the provinces, particularly in the great residential  complexes, was a source of concern for various reasons. The  public security was threatened alongside the deterioration of  the public authorities' capabilities and the prevalence of chaos  and confusion in all sectors. Faced by this rapid deterioration  of the political, social, and security atmosphere, the national  forces -- aware of the fatal danger that was lurking over  Algeria -- decided to halt this destructive process and declared  a state of emergency. Despite the noticeable progress as a  result of declaring a state of emergency to restore law and  order, the forces of evil have not stopped. They have committed  terrorist, barbaric, and destructive crimes, some of which I  recall: the assassination of the government's representatives,  war veterans and martyrs' sons; the assassination of ordinary  citizens, men, women, mothers, children, young and elderly; the  assassination of foreign nationals who came to our country to  contribute to the economy of the country; the plundering and  sabotage acts against financial institutes, post offices, and  public and private enterprises; the daily robbing and stripping  citizens of their money; sabotaging collective complexes; and  setting fire and destroying administrative and economic public  enterprises.    These savage actions are being carried out by people who  claim to be religious and use religion as a political means.  They are being carried out by a small band of perverts and  persons who have judicial records, who harbor hatred -- the  enemies of the homeland -- whose hearts are still pained to see  Algeria independent, and who act as if they are on enemy soil.  They are receiving support from certain countries which are  living under oppressive and backward regimes and do not conceal  their intention to spread this type of regime to Algeria.    To foil this subversive process, the public authorities  carried out a series of actions to protect individuals and  property and to put an end to this disease at its roots. The  security forces, the state cadres, and the local communities --  and here we should not forget to stress their great sacrifices  and their devotion, as well as their altruism in serving the  country's sublime interests -- have implemented practical  security measures to protect individuals and their property.  These are particularly manifested in the following:  undertaking the protection of installations of public economic  establishments and public administrative departments; the  protection of foreign missions, foreign establishments, and  foreign employees who are present on the national soil; the  protection of individuals, establishments, and public and  private bodies; the consolidation of the local public security;  and searching and putting an end to the perpetrators of criminal  acts.    The fact that some political forces have not condemned the  subversion of the economic, social, and cultural institutions  that independent Algeria has achieved at an exorbitant price and  through great sacrifices, is regarded as an act of treachery,  which the next generation will not forgive.    History will judge all those who kept silent: Their silence  is shameful. They kept silent while repugnant crimes were being  committed against national assets and innocent citizens, namely  state employees, the mojahedin, and the foreigners who came here  to participate in the development of Algeria. Irrespective of  the political differences between us, the people's gains assume  the quality of sacredness and should not be at the center of  political dealings and point scoring.    In the light of these events it appears necessary and  inevitable that the state should retrieve its self-respect and  authority. As a matter of fact we cannot build democracy  without a strong state based on stable structures which  guarantee the continuity of the state and protect it from  politically irresponsible by-ways and deviations.    Proceeding from this [passage indistinct] which adopts  scientific and rational methods which works in the interest of  the citizens, and undertake their tasks in the best way  possible. This is a condition for the continuity of the  Algerian state. The planned reform aims at the following: a  better balance between objectives; centralization or  decentralization; greater protection for officials from  oppression; consolidation of oversight by the state to avoid  discrepancies in local management with regard to the laws and  procedures which are in force by reviving the supervision bodies  at all levels; in consultation with local representatives  reviewing where necessary the administrative division of the  municipalities and districts in an effort to give more  effectiveness and a better response to citizens' needs;  consolidation of organization and improvement of the financial  management of local communities to achieve a better management  of financial resources.    The weakening of [words indistinct] of the state, capable of  undertaking the major public tasks, and the absence of objective  legalized standards and of a just and rational standard  concerning the assumption of very senior posts have led to the  emergence of nepotism, of favoritism based on region, and  especially of building up an entourage, which led to loyalty to  the state being replaced by loyalty to men. This led to evident  instability in the very senior posts, thus obstructing the  continuity of the state and its institutions.    The current reform, which basically depends on restoring  self-respect to the administration, aims at creating a total and  immediate ban on nepotism, whether based on personal  relationship or regionalism, and of the use of entourage.    In conclusion, it should be said that the modern state which  we want to build requires efficiency, ethics, and tireless work  as we have to raise the challenge anew so that we will not  remain isolated from the march of civilized progress. Our  country still possesses human and material capabilities which  allow it to build a modern and strong state -- a law-governed  state -- which will move the wheel of political development  forward and facilitate entry into a real democracy and an  economic, social, and cultural development within the framework  of a free and organized economy.    It is time for all national forces in the country to unite  our efforts to contribute to the work started by the public  authorities to put an end to terrorism and establish law and  order, and to contribute also in building a strong state  guaranteeing success in the march toward political democracy and  economic revival which will promote the prosperity of Algeria  and make it a country where life is enjoyable -- an Algeria  whose voice will be heard and respected by other nations.    Through our unity and by placing Algeria above every  consideration, we will overcome all obstacles and triumph -- God  willing -- over anyone who diverts us from our path. May God  bring us success for the good of our country. Peace and God's  mercy and blessing be upon you. [applause]</p>

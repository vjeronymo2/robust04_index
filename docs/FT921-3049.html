			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / Survey of Information Technology in Europe (10): Many flowers bloom - The changing face of world telecommunications THE TRANSFORMATION of telecommunications across Europe over the past few years has presented tremendous and undeniable challenges to the users and producers of information technology. Separating the trends from the shifting fog of change is another matter, however. Mr Richard Hooper, special adviser on the information industry to PA, the consulting group, says sharply: 'I hate the word de-regulation. I don't think it's happening.' He says the experience over the last decade in the UK and the US - two of the countries furthest down the process of change - is rather different. There has certainly been a growth in 'liberalisation', with the injection of a greater degree of competition into the sector. But it has been accompanied by a growth in regulation. In the UK, for example, there has been the creation of Oftel, the UK office of telecommunications regulation. As a result, Mr Hooper prefers to characterise the last 10 years as a time of 're-regulation'. 'The key is how much competition do you permit,' he says. 'That is the fundamental European issue. There is no doubt that we are seeing competition. But the questions are where and how much.' Terminology aside, he segments Europe very broadly into three categories on a spectrum of liberalisation. The UK, in common with the US and Japan, has overhauled telecoms more than most. The basic infrastructure itself has been freed from public control, alongside more peripheral aspects of the service. Pressures for further change in the UK nevertheless remain. Sprint, the US company, has made it clear it is interested in operating within the UK, but will insist on access to profitable international routes from which new suppliers are currently barred. Mr Laurence Heyworth, a telecoms analyst with Robert Fleming, the securities house, says: 'The UK has gone quite a long way down the road but it has hesitated in going the whole hog. If it allowed competition on international routes, the rates would fall dramatically, BT would have to raise domestic rates, Mercury's financial viability might be questioned, and it would lead to political troubles.' Germany and most of the north European countries, by contrast, hold an intermediate position in Hooper's typology, with some restrictions removed. Germany has not yet liberalised its network and voice systems, for example. 'Sooner or later there will be pressure for Germany to allow two suppliers of telephony and infrastructure,' he says. He suggests that this will result in a toughly-contested battle with the Bundespost, which will argue it needs to be protected from competition, particularly after it has invested heavily in improving communications in the states of the former communist east Germany. Overall, he says the northern countries 'noticed the British model and saw that civilisation didn't end in the 1980s'. More controversially, governments saw some evidence that prices had dropped as a result of liberalisation. Then, he says, it is possible to draw a clear line through Brussels. Southwards, in the 'Latin countries', he sees a more traditional, state-controlled service which is likely to change more slowly. In France, for example, two 'sacred monopolies' remain: the infrastructure, including the carriage of data and voice information; and the voice and public switch equipment. These elements remain sacrosanct, he says. That reflects both a traditional role of the French state in guiding manufacturing policy, and a sense of social and democratic obligations: that residential services should be cross-subsidised by more profitable national and international business calls to ensure the availability of a comprehensive and affordable phone service to everyone. The UK has also gone further than most countries philosophically, he argues. The Department of Trade and Industry has decided that fundamental questions over the size of the market and how many players should be allowed should be left to the private sector to determine. In the case of telepoint, the portable phone system which allows out-going calls from a lightweight handset held near one of a number of permanent base stations, that has resulted in licences issued to four operators, three of which are now dormant despite large expenditures on the installation of equipment and recruitment of customers. Hooper believes it is difficult to decide how far these fundamental issues should be left to the market. 'It's not the same as making decisions about supermarkets,' he says. The distinction is that telecoms involve the use of a scarce resource, and involve what he calls 'the constraint of how many people want to dig up the road outside'. 'Even the most liberal Americans would say that it was crazy to go too far. You need some mechanism to help you decide,' he says. The implications for the suppliers and users of information technology are widespread but not clear-cut. Hooper sees 'a classic consolidation of the industry' taking place. Research and development costs are forcing collaborations. He sees the number of equipment suppliers dropping as a result. A key question is whether there will be a convergence between computer and telecom suppliers. Robert Fleming's views are similar. In a research report released this February, it argues that Alcatel Alsthom, the market leader for public communications networks, will survive because of both its size and its geographical and product spread. (This was underlined last week by its purchase of ITT's 30 per cent stake in its main telecoms subsidiary, Alcatel NV.) Siemens has some of the same advantages, but is heavily dependent on Germany, and is likely to suffer as a result with pending de-regulation and privatisation. Smaller suppliers such as Ericsson and Nokia are already suffering cutbacks in delivery volumes. The future of two companies, and of Ascom, an Ericsson licensee, is considerably more in question, Flemings argues. Liberalisation has certainly boosted the variety and types of equipment manufactured. For users, it has meant very good news: there has been a huge increase in the speed, variety and range of telecommunications services provided. These include cable television, electronic document interchange and video telephony, for instance. On the one hand, the market has grown substantially in those countries which have been opened up to competition. On the other, the pace of innovation and the introduction of new competing businesses has also brought price reductions and the demand for quicker delivery. 'In the golden old days, there was a monopoly buyer, and long-term fixed-price contracts,' he says. 'Now it is much more complicated.' Adds Heyworth: 'I don't think you could argue that liberalisation has benefited IT equipment suppliers in the short term. It's more a matter of what could happen in the long term. It is totally inevitable across Europe that telecoms will become entirely competitive.'</p>

			<p>921024 FT  24 OCT 92 / User Friendly, but only up to a point . . .: Michael Thompson-Noel meets owner Bill Gredley TWENTY-ONE years ago I stood in the grandstand at Epsom racecourse and watched Mill Reef, one of the century's greatest racehorses, flash to victory in the English Derby. At the end of that season - 1971 - I and hundreds of Mill Reef's fans flew to Paris where Paul Mellon's champion scored his most famous victory in Longchamp's Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe, the world's greatest horserace. Mill Reef has departed. He has gone to the paddock in the sky where he listens to celestial birdsong and watches beautiful cloudscapes compose and recompose themselves, morning and night, above the marble-bright stable reserved for Turf Legends. Gone, but not forgotten, for Mill Reef's genes still whizz round racetracks with graceful athleticism, and will do so for centuries. Seven years after Mill Reef won at Epsom, one of his sons, Shirley Heights, also won the English Derby. Seven years after that, one of his sons, Slip Anchor, won the English Derby. And seven years after that, in June 1992, one of Slip Anchor's daughters, a bay filly named User Friendly, won the English Oaks, the distaff equivalent of the Derby, as part of her lead-up to her second-place finish, beaten a scant neck, in the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe three weeks ago. To breed and own a racehorse like Mill Reef or User Friendly is one of the rarest distinctions in sport. Many have tried. They have spent colossally. But their money has evaporated. In the history of the racehorse - also known as the thoroughbred - untold billions' worth of time, skill and patient endeavour has been lost down the drain, flung to the winds, in the effort to produce champions. Explanation: no one really knows why one racehorse runs faster than another. To find the man who bred and owns User Friendly I drove north from London to Newmarket, through Six Mile Bottom, right at the roundabout to the village of Stetchworth, left into Church Lane and up to the entrance to Stetchworth Park Stud. I stopped the car at a big white gate. It opened electronically. In I ventured, nursing my car over the sleeping policemen that are one of the millionaire-hallmarks of big-scale racing estates, from Newmarket to Normandy to blue-grass Kentucky. Fountains plashed languidly. Everything shone immaculately. Serious money. Extremely serious money. The owner of Stetchworth Park, where User Friendly was born, is Bill Gredley, a mild and modest Englishman, 59, whose privately-owned Unex Group (property, oil and gas in Canada, local bus companies, etc), has assets, he told me, of about Pounds 100m  - suitable underpinning for a racing empire of 170-180 horses, including mares, stallions, foals, yearlings and horses in training. Totalling 1,000 acres, Stetchworth Park is probably the biggest non-Arab-owned racing operation in Britain. Recently, Bill Gredley called for a one-day boycott of racing by owners to protest at low levels of prize money. He withdrew the call last Tuesday. Bill Gredley started in racing in the mid-1970s when he was farming in Hertfordshire and decided to buy a couple of mares. From there, things grew and grew. Had his successes, especially with User Friendly, exceeded his fondest expectations? 'With the number of horses that we're running, and with our breeding programme, we'd be disappointed if we didn't breed a Group 1 winner (the highest category) every year. I know it is difficult, but we've gone close with a lot of other good horses, not just User Friendly.' Can anyone breed champions? 'No, I don't think they can. I think you have to have a feel for the horse. You have to have some empathy. There's a lot of people who can do it, but they tend to follow traditional lines, whereas I do things differently. There is a certain amount of luck in it as well.' Was his racing self-financing, or was he constantly pouring money into it? 'No, not really. Last year our prize money earnings were about Pounds 400,000. This year, mainly with User Friendly, we've got nearly Pounds 800,000. And we sell horses at the sales. We sold one the other day for 400,000 guineas (Pounds 420,000), a full brother to User Friendly. And I suppose if we wanted to sell User Friendly herself we would get an enormous sum for her. We take the view that everything is for sale. We are a business, and sensible offers are always considered.' I asked: 'How much is she worth? Is she worth the Pounds 1.25m that I guesstimated in the Weekend FT the other day, or more?' Bill Gredley smiled. 'I read your piece. I think you were a bit low', he said. 'For a start, she's now going for the Japan Cup in Tokyo on November 22, and that could be worth Pounds 750,000.' In addition, she stays in training next year, when she could win anything up to or over Pounds 1m. Although her owner would not say, for reasons of commercial caution, it is clear he thinks that User Friendly is easily worth Pounds 2m-plus. Was User Friendly well? 'Very well. In the Arc she lost 12 or 15 kilos, but put the weight straight back on. She's a wonderful horse to train because she has a run, she has a week's rest, then she does two or three bits of work and she's off again to the races. The only raw exercise she's really getting is in her races. 'Next year she'll be better than ever. She has improved with every race. She's the most remarkable filly. She's got stamina, speed, temperament and manoeuvrability. If she had won the Arc it would have been a fairytale, but we were happy being second. 'User Friendly has come at a good time. My wife died two months ago after a long illness. It was a traumatic time, and in a strange way User Friendly's success helped Sara towards the end. User Friendly helped to soften our sorrow and keep everyone busy.' I asked Bill Gredley what qualities he brought to the business of producing racehorses. 'I consider myself a judge of a horse,' he said. 'I don't rely on others to do my buying, so in that sense I am my own man. If I see a good horse, I'll buy it, though not for a lot of money. The idea is not to spend big money. I have a stud manager here. We talk about conformation and so on, but I sort out the matings myself. We have a training establishment here as well as the stud. 'Everything is cost-efficient. What we do is find out the good ones and put them into training. The bad ones we sift out here. It's very cheap to do it that way. That's something we started last year, and it's completely new, an innovation. We can have up to 30 yearlings. If you find four or five out of 30 worth sending to an outside trainer, you'll be very happy. 'There is a lot of tradition in horse racing, and people think one should carry on in the time-honoured way. But I don't subscribe to that. I have a different approach to breeding and racing. We tilt at windmills, and have been very successful in doing so. 'I'm not one for yachts or too much leisure. I get pleasure from seeing the horses, working them, handling them, talking to them, understanding them. It's something you don't just acquire overnight. I get satisfaction also from the fact that we're reasonably successful, and like most other things it has to pay for itself. If we were to run at a loss, like any other business we would have to cut back. I'm not saying we run it at a great profit, but we are certainly keeping our heads above water.' I asked Bill Gredley if he was highly competitive, the way that many owners are. 'I don't think so. I'm very laid back, very relaxed. I'm not someone who must win at all costs.' Did British racing need more prize money? 'Yes. It used to be the Sport of Kings, and people didn't worry about cost. But things have moved on. It now costs, I suppose, an average of Pounds 20,000 to buy a horse, and another Pounds 18,000 a year to train and race it, which is a lot of money. I know that you don't have to buy horses. But people do, and that is why there is a sport. There must be more prize money. 'There are, and always will be, a small minority of owners who would race for nothing. But the others need some hope that they're going to get something back from their racing. If you don't give them that hope they'll drift out and racing will go down and down. It will be counter-productive for the government.' Although he doesn't use the strike word, Bill Gredley called for a one-day strike by owners for higher prize money. 'The owners ought to instruct their trainers not to enter their horses for a particular Monday. Just once. Just to demonstrate what would happen if the betting shops didn't have horse racing. Horse racing is an institution, quite unique. The money racing needs should come from the turnover tax on betting, at present 7 3/4 per cent. The government is getting Pounds 320m in this way. If they don't keep racing pump-primed by putting more of the betting tax back into the industry, I can see that their take will go down to Pounds 180m.' 'But there are thousands of races,' I countered, 'and thousands of horses. Never have I entered a betting shop or opened a newspaper and said: 'Blow me down, there aren't many horses to bet on today'.' Again Bill Gredley smiled. 'You might have to reconsider that next year', he said. 'There's nobody buying horses. Trainers haven't got orders. And that is a forewarning of what is happening.' Will he ever breed another User Friendly? 'I'll be disappointed if I don't,' he said. 'I consider myself a young man at this game.'</p>

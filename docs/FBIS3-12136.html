			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Cairo, 25 Feb (MENA)-- Dr. Mufid Shihab, chairman of  the People's Assembly's Arab and Foreign Relations and National  Security Committee, has called an emergency meeting of the  committee tomorrow, Saturday, to discuss the massacres Israeli  settlers committed against the Palestinians, how to address the  issue, and the impact it will have on the regional peace process.    In exclusive statements to MENA, Dr. Shihab said the  massacre  was criminal and barbaric and should be strongly condemned by  all peace loving powers. He pointed to the danger of  maintaining Israeli settlements in the occupied territories,  adding that Israel should seriously contemplate the removal of  these settlements from the Palestinian territories if we want  peace and security to be real and to last.    Dr. Shihab held Israel fully responsible for the massacre,  since the 1949 Geneva agreements give the occupying state the  authority to run and organize utilities in the occupied  territories. These agreements hold the occupying state solely  responsible for protecting the lives and safety of all the  residents of these territories, he said, adding: Hence, Israel  has not honored these commitments.    He remarked that this calls for serious thinking about  imposing international protection on the territories and their  residents. This protection should be approved by the  international community and the concerned institutions,  primarily the UN Security Council. He emphasized that this  international protection should be provided to the Palestinians  on their lands, since it has been proven that the Israeli army  and administration are incapable of providing protection to  them, adding that this is important if we want the peace  negotiations to continue.    Dr. Shihab voiced his support for Palestinian president  Yasir  'Arafat's call for a Security Council meeting to discuss this  issue. He called on the Council to intervene quickly and  decisively and discuss this incident and its consequences and to  discuss the setting up of the necessary guarantees to protect  the security of Palestinian citizens from the violent practices  of the Israeli settlers and the Israeli forces' lack of  seriousness in confronting these violent practices.    He added that it is painful to see the Israeli forces  confronting the unarmed demonstrators who wanted to denounce  this massacre and to see them killing more demonstrators instead  of seriously acting to stop the Israeli settlers' criminal acts.</p>

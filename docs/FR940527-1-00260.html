			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Recommendation 16: Improvements in the PPS Hospital Wage Index <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary should substantially revise the hospital wage index under PPS for fiscal year 1995. The revised wage index should be calculated using hospital-specific labor market definitions based on hospital geographic proximity measured by the air-mile distances between nearby hospitals. The Congress should repeal the current statutory provisions relating to geographic reclassification for the wage index. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission believes the wage index would be substantially more accurate if it were calculated using hospital-specific labor market areas based on geographic proximity rather than on political boundaries, as is now the case. Under this approach, a labor market area would be defined for each hospital (the target hospital), including only hospitals located in its immediate vicinity. Consequently, each hospital's ``nearest neighbor'' wage index would reflect its own wage rate averaged with those paid by other nearby hospitals. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This approach has strong intuitive appeal. Hospitals located near each other represent potential alternative sources of employment for health care workers living in the area. Therefore, in almost all instances, the average wage rate paid by all nearby hospitals should provide a reasonably accurate measure of the amount the target hospital must pay to compete for labor. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ProPAC's analysis suggests that hospital-specific labor market areas offer important advantages compared with the present definitions. The current market areas have fixed borders defined by the county and state boundaries of metropolitan statistical areas and statewide rural areas. Hospitals located near each other but on opposite sides of such borders often have widely different wage indexes and PPS payment rates, even though they face similar local market conditions. By contrast, nearest neighbor labor markets for nearby hospitals overlap substantially, including many of the same hospitals. This tends to reduce the likelihood of large differences in their wage index values. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A second advantage is that nearest neighbor labor market areas generally are much smaller than the current labor market areas. Consequently, they more effectively capture geographic differences in market wage levels. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under current policy, hospitals located in the same labor market area have the same wage index, which is based on the average wage for the area. Excluding the effects of geographic reclassification, about 65 percent of all PPS hospitals incur a large loss or a large gain because their hourly wage rates differ from the labor market average by more than 5 percent. Because many labor market areas are large, however, local hospital wage levels often vary substantially within them. As a result, a significant portion of the losses and gains currently experienced by individual hospitals are attributable to their location in a part of the market area where local wage rates are higher or lower than the labor market average. Although many of these hospitals pay wage rates that are consistent with those of other nearby hospitals, they are inappropriately penalized or rewarded because the local wage level differs from the labor market average. This results in inequitable payment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under a nearest neighbor approach, each hospital's wage index would be based on the level of wage rates paid by hospitals located nearby. Consequently, many of the hospitals that now face large losses or gains would find these discrepancies reduced or eliminated. Other hospitals are inappropriately sheltered by the current system. Many of these hospitals would find their small losses or gains substantially altered, reflecting the level of wages in their immediate area. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Implementation of a nearest neighbor wage index in fiscal year 1995 would result in a substantial redistribution of PPS payments among hospitals. However, these changes would make payments more accurate and equitable. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ProPAC has examined a number of alternatives for determining the most appropriate size of nearest neighbor labor market areas. Increases in the size of the market areas tend to have two different effects. On the one hand, the wage index values for nearby hospitals are less likely to be substantially different. Consequently, hospitals located near each other are less apt to be paid significantly different PPS payment rates. This occurs because each hospital's wage index is based on wage data for a larger number of hospitals. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On the other hand, larger market areas include hospitals that are located farther from the target hospital. Consequently, wage rates within each area tend to vary more. This suggests that some of the more distant hospitals may face labor market conditions that differ from those in the immediate vicinity of the target hospital. Therefore, using larger market areas may yield wage index values that are less accurate indicators of the labor market conditions faced by the target hospital. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finding a balance between these conflicting outcomes is complicated by the fact that hospital circumstances vary widely. About 30 percent of all PPS hospitals are located in relatively high density areas, with seven or more other PPS hospitals located within a radius of 20 miles. At the other end of the spectrum, 46 percent of all PPS hospitals are located in low density areas, with fewer than three other hospitals located within 20 miles. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For hospitals in areas where there are many other hospitals nearby, hospital-specific labor market areas could include the nearest 15 hospitals within a 20-mile radius. This would keep the variability in wage rates at a low level, while limiting the frequency of large differences in wage indexes among nearby hospitals. For hospitals located in areas with few hospitals nearby, hospital-specific markets should include at least three other hospitals. In many instances, this would require going beyond 20 miles. To avoid incorporating hospitals facing substantially different labor market conditions, however, the maximum distance should be 30 to 35 miles. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In short, a labor market area could be defined for each hospital by including the nearest 15 hospitals within a 20-mile radius, but going up to a maximum of 30 to 35 miles to find at least three other hospitals. Although any of these criteria could be modified, minor changes probably would not make the wage index less accurate. A wage index based on labor market definitions similar to those outlined above would, in ProPAC's view, be far more accurate than the current one. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Implementation of this approach would impose both one-time and ongoing administrative burdens on HCFA. For example, HCFA would need to verify the latitude and longitude coordinates for each PPS hospital. Methods and procedures would need to be developed for incorporating new hospitals into the wage index, and for dealing with multi-campus hospitals. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, HCFA would need to devise methods and administrative processes for addressing requests for exceptions. The Commission's research shows that hospital-specific labor market areas defined using air-mile distances generally correspond closely with those defined using road miles. Differences will occur, however, because of the presence of major transportation barriers such as a river or mountainous terrain. An exceptions process may be needed where a road-mile definition would produce a substantially different wage index. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ProPAC recognizes that adoption of a new wage index based on nearest neighbor labor markets will have a significant effect on PPS payments for many hospitals. This effect is due partly to changes in the labor market definitions, and partly to eliminating geographic reclassification for the wage index. The Commission believes strongly that continued reclassification of the wage index would not be needed once a nearest neighbor wage index is implemented. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Hospitals whose wage index values are reduced by the adoption of a nearest neighbor wage index would receive lower payments because of this change. ProPAC believes, however, that such changes in hospital wage index values generally would reflect improvements in accuracy and fairness. Hospitals whose wage indexes decline would be primarily those previously sheltered by their inclusion in an appropriately large labor market area or those that received an in appropriately high wage index because of geographic reclassification. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Recommendation 17: Nursing Facility Wage Index <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary should collect data on employee compensation and paid hours of employment for employees of nursing facilities that care for Medicare skilled nursing facility patients. Once these data become available, the Secretary should develop a nursing facility wage index and use it to adjust Medicare skilled nursing facility payments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / Observer: No charge A mobile phone racket which has already confused the airwaves over Australia and Sweden has hit London. High tech criminals who have pinched mobiles have found a way of altering the in-built electronic security number so that the bill goes to another user.

Gives Freefone numbers a whole new meaning.</p>

			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / International Company News: Tiffany takes control in Japan TIFFANY, the New York-based jewellers, is taking over management and marketing responsibility for 29 Tiffany boutiques in Japan, currently operated by Mitsukoshi, the country's leading department store. Mitsukoshi accounts for more than 90 per cent of Tiffany's sales in Japan. The move will give the US group greater flexibility to distribute its products to other Japanese retailers. Mitsukoshi owns 14 per cent of Tiffany. The decision will also relieve Mitsukoshi's mounting inventory of Tiffany products, which have been hit by the sharp fall in Japan's consumer demand for luxury goods. As a result, Tiffany will take an after-tax charge of about Dollars 32.7m against its second-quarter earnings. Tiffany said that the charge stemmed from a Dollars 57.5m product return reserve which it had established as result of its decision to repurchase most of the Mitsukoshi's Tiffany stocks over the next four years. Under the new arrangement, Tiffany will provide the merchandising and management expertise for the 29 boutiques, while Mitsukoshi continues to provide and maintain the locations and staffing. Tiffany previously sold the merchandise on a wholesale basis to Mitsukoshi. The two companies have also agreed to set up a new marketing operation to look over marketing and promotion planning for sales of Tiffany products in Japan. Tiffany and Mitsukoshi's relationship started in 1972.</p>

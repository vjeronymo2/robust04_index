			<p>930525 FT  25 MAY 93 / High interest rates attacked in Venezuela MR Octavio Lepage, Venezuela's caretaker president, indicated yesterday that reducing the country's high domestic interest rates was one of his first priorities. He said he would meet the board of the central bank in an effort to encourage it to 'design measures to correct this problem immediately'. However, given the independence of the bank, it was unclear how Mr Lepage would achieve a rate cut. With annual inflation at more than 30 per cent in the past 12 months, Venezuela has real interest rates of 30 per cent or more for commercial loans. Having met business leaders at the weekend, the acting-president also said he would review national economic policy and decide whether changes were needed. Mr Lepage, a senator in the ruling Democratic Action party, was sworn in as acting president on Friday after President Carlos Andres Perez was suspended to face a charge of misuse of public funds. The trial will be before the supreme court, which is expected to take this week the first steps towards a hearing. Mr Lepage admitted he was not 'an economic expert' but said he believed Mr Perez's unpopular free-market reforms of the past four years were 'correct in strategic terms'. However, he rejected what he called 'dogmatism and the use of foreign models' in implementing 'IMF-style' economic adjustments. The acting president, although the focus of a controversy over how long he should stay in office, said the situation in Venezuela was 'critical, but perfectly manageable'. He admitted that the government was 'weak' and needed a stronger base through some 'national understanding' among the political parties'. Congress, caught in the storm over Mr Perez, has not acted on bills aimed at economic and political reform. These include new taxes to help close the fiscal gap, reductions in the national oil companies' tax burden, as well as proposed reforms of the financial system.</p>

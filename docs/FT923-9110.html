			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / International Company News: Quaker Oats slips 2% in quarter QUAKER Oats, the Chicago-based food, beverage and pet foods company, yesterday posted a 2 per cent decline in fourth-quarter net income to Dollars 103.9m, from Dollars 106.4m a year earlier, on flat sales of Dollars 1.54bn. Earnings per share held steady at Dollars 1.38, with fewer shares outstanding in the latest quarter. For the full year, Quaker Oats had net income of Dollars 247.6m, or Dollars 3.25, compared with Dollars 235.8m, or Dollars 2.65, a year ago. Results for last year included a Dollars 30m loss from the discontinued operations of Fisher-Price. Sales rose to Dollars 5.58bn from Dollars 5.49bn. Mr William Smithburg, chairman and chief executive, said the earnings decline in the second half of this year reflected a change in the timing of the company's trade promotions. However, he expects this change to boost the company's results for first half of fiscal 1993. During the quarter, a 17.7 per cent improvement in international grocery sales to Dollars 491.8m helped offset a 6.1 per cent decline in north American product sales to Dollars 1.05bn. Operating income from international grocery products rose 5 per cent to Dollars 41.7m, while US and Canadian operations saw a 4.2 per cent decline in operating income to Dollars 170.4m. Woolworth, the US stores group, said its FW Woolworth Co unit was to acquire 89 Joan Bari and Cabaret accessories boutiques from Edison Brothers Stores. Terms were not disclosed. FW Woolworth will assume operation of the stores, which average in size about 1,000 sq ft, in September. Edison said the acquisition by Woolworth was for the entire chain of stores. In 1991, the Joan Bari/Cabaret chain generated 1.7 per cent of Edison's sales and none of its profits. In addition to cash, Edison said it would get up to three leases from the Richman Brothers and Anderson-Little chains, which Woolworth said it was to soon close. Edison Bros said the leases will be used for its menswear and footwear chains.</p>

			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / PosTel puts southern farmland valued at Pounds 15m up for sale POSTEL, one of the UK's largest institutional investors, is putting 7,745 acres of farmland up for sale. The fund's proposed disposal follows a decision several years ago to reduce its agricultural land holdings. The value of the four farms for sale in Hampshire and Wiltshire is about Pounds 15m, although no asking price has been decided. PosTel, which invests the pension funds of British Telecom and the Post Office, bought the farms in the mid-1970s. At that time many institutions acquired agricultural property in the belief that it would prove a good hedge against inflation. This trend was reversed in the 1980s when the funds became disillusioned with the performance of agricultural property. According to Savills, property adviser, the value of the land has fallen by about 60 per cent in real terms since 1979 to about Pounds 1,500 an acre. Values in real terms are at their lowest for 30 years. Many institutions disinvested from agricultural property in recent years to concentrate on core portfolios. Notable recent deals include the sale by British Coal's pension fund of a 11,500-acre estate in 1990, Guardian Royal Exchange's sale of 22,500 acres of land in 1991, and Norwich Union's sale of 9,500 acres to the Crown Estate last year. PosTel said it would start marketing three of the estates in May. The properties are the 2,275-acre Brown Candover Estate near Winchester, the 1,150-acre Manor Farm at North Oakley near Basingstoke and the 720-acre Manor Farm at West Overton near Marlborough. A fourth estate, the 3,600-acre Longwood Estate near Winchester, is likely to be put on the later. The farms have been managed by Booker Farming for the past eight years. Mr Richard Denny of Cluttons, which is marketing the Hampshire estates, said he expected the buyer to be a commercial farmer, possibly one with adjoining land. Mr Andrew Martin of PosTel said he expected 'significant interest' in the estates. Mr Denny said there had been few good quality farms placed on the market in the past year. The shortage of stock and an improvement in farm profitability was likely to lead to a tentative recovery in the agricultural land market, he said. 'There is more confidence in the market although I don't anticipate a dramatic increase in values.' The decline in real property values in the 1980s was largely due to declining farm incomes as a result of reforms of the Common Agricultural Policy, which was producing unsustainably large food surpluses. The decline was interrupted briefly by rising prices in 1988-89, when land values were boosted by new investors, often wealthy business people wishing to live in the countryside. But demand evaporated once the recession took hold and prices fell sharply from a peak of Pounds 2,300 an acre in 1988 to about Pounds 1,500. The agreement reached over reform of the CAP last year, which will result in the set-aside of 1.5m acres of farmland, took some of the uncertainty out of the agricultural market. The reduction of interest rates and improvements in farm profitability reduced the risk of forced sales of farms. Another important factor in stabilising farm values was the fall in the value of sterling after its exit from the exchange rate mechanism in September, which boosted farm incomes. According to the Ministry of Agriculture devaluation and lower interest rates resulted in a 23.6 per cent increase in UK farm incomes to Pounds 1.8bn last year. The view that farmland values have stabilised is supported by a recent survey by the Farmland Market journal and the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. It said although few surveyors expected farm price increases this year, a prolonged shortage of new properties on the market could lead to small increases.</p>

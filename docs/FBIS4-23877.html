			<p>BFN     [Text] Kigali, 17 Jun (AFP) -- Rwandan rebels captured  Kigali's key Sainte-Famille church complex from government  forces early Friday [17 June] after an intense battle, a UN  military spokesman said. The Tutsi-dominated Rwandan Patriotic  Front (RPF) rebels took control of the church from Hutu-led  government soldiers and Hutu militia, said Major Jean-Guy Plante  for the UN mission here. The RPF success came after intense  fighting despite a ceasefire announced Wednesday in Tunis at the  closure of the Organisation of African Unity summit.</p>

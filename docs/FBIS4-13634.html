			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on joint news conference by Foreign Minister Shim'on </F> Peres and PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat in Bucharest on 21 April --  recorded]    [Text] A joint news conference by Foreign Minister Shim'on  Peres and PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat ended in Bucharest a short  while ago. The two summed up with satisfaction 24 hours of  intensive discussions. The following is an excerpt of the news  conference:    [Begin recording] ['Arafat, in English] We are all doing  our best to find a solution for this conflict. I don't want to  say conflict, no, but it's a conflict between brothers. I am  sure of that, especially with his excellency, Mr. Peres, with  his goodwill, we can push forward the peace process.    [Peres] So I think the unhappiness of Yugoslavia is  different from the unhappiness in the Middle East, and  furthermore, in Yugoslavia you have an aggressor and you have a  victim. In the case of the Middle East you have two negotiators  who are trying to put an end to the conflict. [end recording]</p>

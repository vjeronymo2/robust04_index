			<p><P> July 7, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> A LOOK AT THE MYSTERY OF INDIA'S INDEPENDENCE;  </P> <P> RUSHDIE'S 'RIDDLE' UNFOLDS IN DOCUMENTARY  </P> <P> It is cruel but fair to say that Salman Rushdie's career owes much to the late  Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.  </P> <P> It was not "The Satanic Verses" but the death sentence imposed by Khomeini that  boosted Rushdie's book sales, made the author a living martyr for free  expression and -- because he was forced into hiding, where he remains -- made  him a mystery man as well.  </P> <P> And when, on Sunday, cable's Discovery Channel presents "The Riddle of  Midnight," a 90-minute documentary on India based on Rushdie's 1980 novel,  "Midnight's Children," there is no doubt that many people will be tuning in to  get a glimpse of Rushdie. The now-secluded author narrates and appears  throughout.  </P> <P> "The Riddle of Midnight" is dense and often difficult to follow. It was made in  1987 for Britain's Channel Four. Viewers there, well-versed in British colonial  history, undoubtedly had more background to draw on.  </P> <P> The film does provide some insights into Rushdie and his place in the Muslim  world.  </P> <P> Born in India, Rushdie is the product of an affluent, urban Muslim family.  </P> <P> "I come from the Indian bourgeoisie, one of the most confident, successful,  doubt-free groups of wealth-creators on the planet," Rushdie explains in the  film. "But I have my doubts these days about that doubtlessness. Does wealth  really trickle down, let's say, from high rise to hovel?"  </P> <P> After spending most of his adult life in England, however, Rushdie is seen  returning in the 40th year of India's independence (and his birth). He finds "a  throng not only of people but also of dreams, memories, fears, hopes, portends,  fictions and Gods." This is Rushdie's personal rediscovery of his native India,  a country of enormous political, cultural and religious complexity as well as  ironies.  </P> <P> Rushdie's original work, "Midnight's Children," was fiction, populated by the  children born in the hour of India's independence. "The Riddle of Midnight"  finds the real-life counterparts to those characters -- a Parsee businessman, a  Bombay "pavement dweller," a Hindu demagogue, farmers and, in the film's most  moving moment, a Sikh woman whose family was murdered by government-sponsored  terrorists.  </P> <P> Divided into three sections, "The City," "The Country" and "The Gods," "The  Riddle of Midnight" refers to the puzzle of Indian independence, which was born  at midnight on Aug. 14 and 15 in 1947.  </P> <P> On that day, Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, the Hindu leader of  India's movement for independence, said: "At the strike of the midnight hour,  when the world sleeps, India will awake to life and freedom. A moment comes,  which comes but rarely in history, when we step out from the old to the new,  when an age ends and when the soul of a nation finds utterance."  </P> <P> What Rushdie finds on his return, however, is a cacophony of social discord,  confusion and danger.  </P> <P> In "The City" he finds "the systematic creation of a militant Hindu  fundamentalist consciousness. That's something new in India." He finds  bourgeois businessmen losing sight of their heritage as they continue to  embrace Western styles and cultures. He finds families of pavement dwellers who  live "in the uncaring shadow" of the skyscrapers their cheap labor has built  but who, to the government of Bombay, are statistical "mirages" and, therefore,  do not exist.  </P> <P> In "The Country" Rushdie finds Marxism taking root. One woman, who has the  local party to thank for her increase in wages, explains her stomach-first  politics in plain and simple terms. "This is the only party that has benefited  me. So how can I support any other party?"  </P> <P> The riddle, Rushdie finally explains, is, "How can a nation that never  previously existed become independent? What does it mean to call this crowd of  separate, national histories, conflicting cultures and warring faiths a nation?  Maybe it's just something we made up. A story. A dream. Then again, maybe such  fictions can become facts."  </P> <P> The reality of India and the price of independence, though, has been a harsh  one for many of its people, who live marginal, hand-to-mouth lives.  </P> <P> "I don't know what is going to happen to India," one man concludes.  </P> <P> "Here is the heart of the riddle," Rushdie says: "What is a real Indian, and  conversely, what is another one?" Answering his own question, he decides, "Born  of India, born of Indian parents, it's the lack of definition that unites you."  </P></p>

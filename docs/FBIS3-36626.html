Moscow  Urges Restraint"]    [Text] Following Saturday's tragedy, when 68 people were  killed and around 200 were wounded by a mortar shell in the  Sarajevo city market, the Bosnia situation is extremely tense.  Few people in the West doubt that the Serbs besieging the  Bosnian capital are responsible for what happened.    On the initiative of France and Britain representatives of  the 16 NATO states are meeting in Brussels Tuesday [8 February]  to consider air strikes against the Bosnian Serbs. UN Secretary  General Butrus-Ghali has also come out in support of such a  step. According to him, the decision to bomb Serbian artillery  positions around Sarajevo does not require a special Security  Council resolution: A positive decision by the NATO council is  sufficient.    Moscow is categorically opposed to such an approach. "We do  not accept Butrus-Ghali's arguments and we do not believe that  the present case is covered by previous Security Council  resolutions. There need to be consultations with the Security  Council members," a senior Russian diplomat observed.    Russia has resolutely condemned the organizers of Saturday's  attack and said that they must be severely punished, but Moscow  is in no hurry to place the blame on the Serbs. "The  investigation is not yet completed. According to ballistics  experts, the mortar shell came from an area where both Serbs and  Muslims have positions. Until the Serbs' responsibility is  proved, the international community must not take any steps," an  informed source in Smolensk Square [site of Foreign Ministry]  told IZVESTIYA.    Moscow is anxiously awaiting the results of the  investigation: If it is established that the mortar was fired by  the Serbs, Russian diplomats are unlikely to be able to persuade  the West to refrain from taking decisive steps. Serbian  President Slobodan Milosevic, who was quick to dissociate  himself from Saturday's action, calling it the "work of war  criminals," would be in an extremely unpleasant position.    Although Belgrade does still have a chance to save face by  blaming extremists who do not answer either to Milosevic or to  Radovan Karadzic, leader of the Bosnian Serbs. If the West  accepts this version, you might merely get a show trial, with  the question of the bombing of Serbian positions removed from  the agenda.    "The West's reaction has to be rational, not emotional.  Before embarking on extreme measures it is necessary to  consider whether this would bring us nearer a settlement or, in  fact, lead to an exacerbation of the conflict," the Russian  diplomat, who deals with the Balkans, believes.    Smolensk Square makes no secret of its annoyance that the  recent Russian initiatives on Bosnia were so coolly received in  the West. "We were actually proposing strengthening the security  zones, including Sarajevo. If our arguments had been heeded,  Saturday's tragedy might have been avoided," one of the authors  of the rejected peace plan said.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["hsm" report: "Eastern Pensions Almost at Western Level"] </F>   [Text] Dresden -- The pensions in the new laender have  almost reached the west German level; pensions of women are  sometimes even considerably higher, says the first social report  of Saxony, which was presented by Saxony's Health Minister Hans  Geisler (Christian Democratic Union) on Monday [28 March].  Because of the clearly higher employment quota at the time of  the GDR, an east German retired couple today gets an average of  2,505 German marks or 99.7 percent of the pension in the west,  even though the relation of basic pensions is only about 75  percent. While the comparable figure for men is only 86.6  percent, women get about 130 percent.    However, Minister Geisler pointed out that elderly people in  the former GDR hardly had any major assets and are, therefore,  covering their vital needs largely from the benefits paid by the  legal pension insurance. In order not to let the difference in  the widow's pensions become too big, the resulting higher claims  in the east should "perhaps be reduced" in future increases by  some percentage points, Geisler said.    The minister said that he is surprised by the relatively  high  number -- 17 percent -- of single fathers in Saxony. Of the  818,000 families with children, 23 percent are so-called  single-parent families.</p>

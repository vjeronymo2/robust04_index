He described isolationist trends, which in his view are  apparent in Russia, as the greatest danger to the relationship  between a reformist Russia and West Europe.    The Finnish foreign minister noted that the West has been  concerned with Russian statements echoing the old philosophy of  spheres of influence and said that Russia must comply with  international norms and codes of behavior in defending its  interests.    Minister Haavisto spoke at a defense policy seminar in  Helsinki.</p>

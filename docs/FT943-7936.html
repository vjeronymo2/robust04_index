			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / International Company News: Volvo finds key to merger failure The terms of a French government 'golden share' and uncertainty over the privatisation of Renault were key issues which led to the collapse last year of Volvo's plan to merge its car and truck operations with Renault, an internal inquiry by the Swedish manufacturer has concluded. The inquiry's author, Mr Arne Wittlov, head of Volvo Aerospace, also indirectly criticised Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar, the former Volvo chairman who resigned when the merger was blocked by a shareholder and management revolt, for not tackling the deep concerns raised by the merger plan. Although Volvo has not published the report, Mr Wittlov outlined his conclusions in an interview in the company's internal magazine Volvo Now. He said he had interviewed some 50 shareholders, executives, board members and trade union members in the course of preparing his report. He said the terms of the golden share the French government intended to keep in the new Renault-Volvo after privatisation meant there was a risk that Volvo's 35 per cent share in the merged company could ultimately be driven down to 20 per cent. 'So there were many who reacted. The deal no longer appeared to be a merger but more of a takeover. Furthermore, the deal was influenced by the lengthy uncertainty surrounding the privatisation of Renault,' Mr Wittlov said. The French government said it intended to sell off Renault by the end of 1994, but could give no cast-iron pledges because of uncertainty over market conditions. Meanwhile, Mr Wittlov said, criticism and doubts grew within Volvo about the industrial logic of the merger. 'People quite simply did not believe in the benefits of co-operation . . . One can ask oneself if the mission was too big. It was a terrific task to throw together two national treasures.' Without mentioning Mr Gyllenhammar, Mr Wittlov added that a lesson of the 'traumatic' affair was the importance of analysing and communicating strategy. 'A company undergoing change must have a visible leadership. 'The process of change must be well-organised,' he said. 'One must also show respect for the worries and uncertainties. The difficulties of co-operation must be admitted and confronted. One must also see the process of change from a shareholder's perspective.'</p>

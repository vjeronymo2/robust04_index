			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / President of Fiji dies in US hospital Ratu Sir Penaia Ganilau of Fiji, thrust unwillingly into the world spotlight by the Pacific island nation's two military coups of 1987, has died while undergoing treatment for leukaemia in the US, Reuter reports from Suva. His death in a Washington hospital, at 75, brought a new note of uncertainty to Fijian politics ahead of elections in February. His deputy, Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara, acting president since Sir Penaia was flown to the US last month, was expected to succeed him as head of state. Sir Penaia was appointed in 1983 as governor-general, the representative of the Crown. Fiji's 1987 election delivered unprecedented political power to the Indian-led Labour party coalition, triggering a military coup by then Colonel Sitiveni Rabuka which replaced it with an indigenous Fijian-dominated government. A tense stand-off ensued but Sir Penaia, nominally head of the armed forces, finally accepted the new regime, bringing criticism from Britain and other Commonwealth nations which in turn prompted Mr Rabuka to declare Fiji a republic. Sir Penaia accepted a role as the nation's first president and, for five years while a new constitution was drawn up to guarantee political supremacy to indigenous Fijians, he sought to cool the divisions in Fiji's multi-racial society. The president has wide powers and plays a key role in the appointment of a prime minister. Under Fiji's racially based constitution, a successor will be chosen by Fiji's Great Council of Chiefs, and must be an indigenous Fijian. Indians, who were brought to Fiji at the turn of the century to work on sugar plantations, make up just under half of Fiji's 750,000 population.</p>

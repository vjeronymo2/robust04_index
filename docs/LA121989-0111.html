			<p><P> December 19, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SIMI VALLEY COUNCIL TENTATIVELY OKS ANTI-GRAFFITI LAW  </P> <P> In an effort to stem vandalism and discourage what officials say is rising gang  activity, the Simi Valley City Council on Monday tentatively approved an  ordinance banning the sale of spray paint to minors and authorizing the city to  eliminate graffiti from private property.  </P> <P> "Graffiti is not just an eyesore, but part of the process by which gangs take  claim to territory," said Simi Valley Mayor Gregory Stratton. "We'd like to  suppress it as quickly as possible."  </P> <P> The proposed ordinance, which is similar to measures enacted recently in Los  Angeles, Beverly Hills and Thousand Oaks, would give private property owners 10  days after notification by the city to remove the graffiti themselves or give  the city written permission to do the job. It also authorizes the city to  assess property owners for cleanup costs and, if necessary, prosecute those who  do not cooperate.  </P> <P> Stratton said gangs are not a major problem in the bedroom community of just  under 100,000 residents, but, "We'd like to stop it before it gets started." He  also said there is the fear in Simi Valley, as there is elsewhere in Ventura  County, of encroaching gang violence from Los Angeles County.  </P> <P> That fear is borne out by recent incidents, according to Kevin McGee, assistant  chief deputy district attorney, who said gangs "use walls and buildings as  their bulletin boards." Although he was unable to provide statistics, McGee  said gang activity has been increasing in Ventura County, some of it local,  some from Los Angeles.  </P> <P> McGee said an adult and a minor, both identified as Los Angeles gang members,  were recently prosecuted in connection with a series of armed robberies in Simi  Valley. Thousand Oaks this year experienced a drive-by shooting and, in a  separate incident, a stabbing at The Oaks mall. Both were gang-related, McGee  said.  </P> <P> Nancy Schreiner, an assistant city attorney for Thousand Oaks, said an  anti-graffiti ordinance adopted last summer was not prompted by gangs but by  vandalism.  </P> <P> Simi Valley Police Chief Lindsey (Paul) Miller said: "We don't really have  gangs per se at this point, just a lot of 'wannabes,' or kids who want to be in  gangs."  </P> <P> Graffiti "at this point is more of a visual nuisance than anything else," he  said. "Once people get used to seeing it, it becomes commonplace. We want a  community where graffiti definitely is not a common thing."  </P> <P> Simi Valley's code-enforcement staff documented 23 incidents of graffiti  between April and October. But code-enforcement Director Jocelyn Reed said  comparisons to prior years are not possible because the city did not keep track  of graffiti separately from other vandalism.  </P> <P> Sixteen of the cases have been remedied, but seven involving uncooperative  property owners remain unresolved, Reed said. The city's new anti-graffiti  ordinance would allow prosecution of the property owners if they do not  cooperate.  </P> <P> As proposed, the measure would prohibit minors from buying or possessing spray  paint, except under the supervision of a responsible adult. If a minor is  arrested for graffiti vandalism, parents or guardians would be responsible for  the cost of its removal.  </P> <P> The ordinance also would authorize the city to pay rewards for information  leading to the arrest and conviction of graffiti vandals.  </P> <P> The abatement program, to be handled by the city's Public Works staff, is  expected to cost $23,000 a year.  </P> <P> The ordinance is expected to be adopted after a second reading at the council's  Jan. 8 meeting, Stratton said.  </P></p>

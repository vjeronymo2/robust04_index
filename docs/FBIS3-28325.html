Among the key officials Hosokawa met separately at his  official residence were Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi  Takemura, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Tsutomu  Hata, and Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii.    Hosokawa insisted that the new 7 percent levy on almost all  goods and services, known as the "National Welfare Tax," is  indispensable to secure funds for a 6 trillion yen tax  reduction, which is a key element in the 15 trillion yen  stimulus package, the aides said.    Political sources said the rift among the coalition parties  is too deep to be healed by Monday, and could affect the  government's efforts to compile the fiscal 1994 budget. The  Hosokawa cabinet is scheduled to decide on the pump-priming  package on Monday, a fiscal 1994 economic projection on  Wednesday and a Finance Ministry budget plan for fiscal 1994 on  Thursday.    Later on Thursday, Hosokawa is scheduled to leave Tokyo for  a  summit with U.S. President Bill Clinton in Washington the next  day.    If things do not go smoothly, the government's plan to adopt  the fiscal 1994 budget by February 15 may have to be delayed  until February 20, political sources said.    In an early morning news conference on February 3, Hosokawa  proposed reducing 6 trillion yen of taxes retroactive to January  1 and replacing the present 3 percent consumption tax with the 7  percent national welfare tax in April 1997. But the proposal  hit major opposition from the Social Democratic Party, the  largest among the seven parties in the ruling coalition, which  threatened to quit the coalition unless the fresh tax plan was  dropped. Even members of Hosokawa's Japan New Party voiced  opposition to the new tax.    Coalition leaders went into huddles to debate the proposal  and finally scrapped Hosokawa's tax cut and increase program on  Friday, about 35 hours after Hosokawa's announcement.    On Saturday, policy-makers of coalition parties held an  emergency meeting and reached a basic agreement on several key  issues, including the 6 trillion yen tax cut plan, government  sources said. The agreement also called for the establishment  of a consultative body to discuss ways to raise funds for the  tax cut, the sources said.    SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama told a news conference in  Gifu, central Japan, that the 6 trillion yen tax cut should be  carried out separately from the new tax proposal because it is  part of the government's pledge to the United States.    He said the new tax proposal surfaced all of a sudden and  still needs time for a careful study.    Murayama proposed forming a consultative panel from the  coalition parties to discuss measures to fund the tax reduction.    The panel should discuss a vision to promote public welfare  and administrative and fiscal reforms, while taking into account  the domestic economic situation, he said.    Ichiro Ozawa, Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] co-leader and  the coalition's chief strategist, in a commercial television  program aired Saturday, said the new tax is important for the  graying Japanese society.    He said the welfare tax concept has gone through a  democratic  process, because it has been discussed by representatives of all  the ruling parties since last year.    Yohei Kono, president of the main opposition Liberal  Democratic Party, said Hosokawa and other responsible officials  have to be blamed for the controversy.    "Remarks by the top political leader of a country bear heavy  responsibility. To our great regret, Mr. Hosokawa showed a lack  of principle," Kono said at a news conference in Otsu.    Kono urged the ruling coalition to make public the course of  developments that led to Hosokawa's news conference to announce  the imposition of the new indirect tax. He also said those who  were involved in the developments must shoulder the blame.</p>

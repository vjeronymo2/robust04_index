			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Car makers seen leading aluminium demand surge Growth in demand for aluminium to the year 2,000 will be substantially faster than in the past seven years, driven particularly by consumption in Asia and by the automotive industry, according to Mr Jacques Bougie, president of Alcan, the world's second-largest aluminium producer. However, demand growth for primary, or new, aluminium is forecast by Alcan to rise only at the same rate as in the years 1986-93. 'Recycling, particularly of beverage cans and cars, will play an increasingly important part in metal sourcing to meet demand in future,' Mr Bougie predicts. 'Star performers' in future, the Alcan analysis suggests, will be the Asia region, including a Japan recovering from recession, where annual aluminium consumption growth is expected to be twice as fast as in the maturing North American market. Growth in Europe and South America is also predicted to outpace that in North America. But North America will remain the biggest individual market for some years to come. Alcan is forecasting that demand for aluminium in cars will grow at an annual 6.5 per cent until the year 2000. Mr Bougie says much of that growth will come from the increased use of castings which already constitute 70 to 80 per cent of the weight of aluminium in the average car. 'Further significant growth may come after the year 2000 when aluminium body structures are adopted for mass-produced cars,' he suggests. Mr Bougie says that at present it is not possible to include the former Eastern European markets in the forecasts because data are not reliably available. But Alcan believes Russia's domestic consumption of aluminium in 1993 was only about 800,000 to 900,000 tonnes, with the 1.9m tonnes balance of its production being exported to the west.  -----------------------------------------------          AVERAGE ANNUAL DEMAND GROWTH                   (PER CENT)  -----------------------------------------------                              1993-     1986-                              2000      1993  ----------------------------------------------- By Region  ----------------------------------------------- North America                 1.9       1.4 South America                 5.8       2.1 Asia                          5.3       6.5 Europe                        4.0       2.5  ----------------------------------------------- Western World Total                         3.9       2.9 Primary                       2.6       2.6  ----------------------------------------------- By End-Use Building                      2.7       2.5 Cans                          3.6       4.3 Transport                     4.5       3.9  ----------------------------------------------- Source: Alcan  -----------------------------------------------</p>

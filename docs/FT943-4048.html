			<p>940910 FT  10 SEP 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: When life is a lottery I have several thousand pounds worth of National Savings premium bonds as well as a few hundred pounds worth of prize bonds issued by the Prize Bond company of Dublin. I like the idea of having a cash deposit linked to a regular, lottery-like chance of winning large cash prizes - and tax-free at that. Are there are any other countries with reliable economies and currencies (such as Germany, the US, Canada, Australia and Switzerland) that issue similar 'lottery bonds'? As far as we are aware, the National Savings premium bonds in the UK and the prize bonds issued by the Republic of Ireland are the only type of deposit schemes which link you to a regular possibility of receiving tax-free cash prizes. Of course, simple lotteries are well established in many countries and, indeed, one is soon to begin in the United Kingdom. They depend, however, on buying tickets and your stake is lost rather than deposited. (Answer by Murray Johnstone Personal Asset Management).

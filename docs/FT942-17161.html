			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / International Company News: Net income falls 4% at Indonesian cement maker Indocement Tunggal Prakarsa, Indonesia's largest cement producer, and its subsidiaries reported net income of Rp312.38bn (Dollars 145m) for 1993, 4.6 per cent down on the previous year's Rp327.39bn, writes Our Financial Staff. Net revenues of Rp2,900bn were 32 per cent higher than the Rp2,200bn a year earlier. The net income fell short of several analysts' expectations of about Rp340bn, in part due to debt repayment. In 1992 Indocement, which is owned by the Liem Sioe Liong group and the Indonesian government, acquired noodle maker Indofood, the Bogasari flour mill, and Wisma Indocement, for a total of about Rp1,700bn rupiah. That significantly increased the cost of interest charges for Indocement for the full year 1993, up 45 per cent to Rp274.29bn, from Rp189.51bn the year earlier. As Indonesia's largest cement producer, Indocement produces about 9.8m tons annually and controls about 50 per cent of the domestic cement market.</p>

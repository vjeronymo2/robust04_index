			<p><P> June 1, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAIL'S AMBIENCE KEEPS INMATES IN LINE  </P> <P> If you gotta do time, this is the place.  </P> <P> The Rose Valley Work Camp, a minimum-security jail that opened May 1, is  nestled in a picturesque glen at the foot of the Topa Topa Mountains, ruggedly  beautiful terrain about half an hour north of Ojai.  </P> <P> Only a six-foot-high chain-link fence, topped with a few strands of barbed  wire, separates the camp from the outside world. The small Quonset huts that  serve as bunkhouses don't even have locks. And inmates, most of whom are there  for drug- or alcohol-related offenses, are given time to watch TV, play  Ping-Pong, shoot pool, lift weights or toss horseshoes on the 10-acre grounds.  </P> <P> "So far, I haven't wanted to leave," said Doug Webb, 24, who is about halfway  through a nine-month sentence for being under the influence of cocaine and for  possession of the drug. "You get to be outside. You can get a tan. It's like a  summer vacation camp."  </P> <P> The Ventura County Sheriff's Department, however, makes sure that nobody's stay  gets too cushy.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Bold Experiment  </P> <P> In what officials describe as a bold experiment in rehabilitation, the relaxed  security at Rose Valley is balanced by character-building, boot camp-style  training.  </P> <P> It's rise and shine at 5:50 a.m., followed by a brisk jog and calisthenics.  Beds must be made tight enough for a quarter to bounce. Work boots are buffed  every day to a shine. And everyone puts in a full eight hours of work, which  for now mostly entails readying the camp to handle the 160 inmates who will  eventually be housed there.  </P> <P> "Self-esteem is the key up here," Assistant Sheriff Richard S. Bryce told a  group of reporters touring the facility last week. "We want to help them  realize they're viable people, that they're worth something. . . . It's not a  country club. It's hard work."  </P> <P> It's also a fairly inexpensive way to ease pressure on the county's badly  overcrowded jail system, which has been at the center of often-rancorous debate  lately. The main Ventura facility, which was designed to hold 400 inmates,  houses about 1,100. And county officials are at odds over where a new prison  should be built.  </P> <P> The Rose Valley camp, which cost $311,000, siphons off inmates from the Honor  Farm branch jail in Ojai, the county's only other minimum-security facility.  There, about 400 men and women serve sentences while growing crops, doing  carpentry and raising about 1,000 hogs for slaughter.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Nonviolent Backgrounds  </P> <P> In selecting inmates for Rose Valley, deputies say they look for people with  the least violent backgrounds and the least criminal sophistication, whose main  problem has been an addiction to drugs or alcohol.  </P> <P> As part of their stay at the work camp, inmates, whose sentences range from 30  days to about a year, must submit to random drug testing and are encouraged to  attend drug and alcohol education classes.  </P> <P> "They have to be willing to cooperate," Sheriff John V. Gillespie said. "If  they screw up, they're sent back. They know there's no second chance."  </P> <P> The camp's congenial atmosphere probably wasn't what White House drug czar  William J. Bennett had in mind when he endorsed federal boot camps for drug  offenders last month.  </P> <P> "The recidivism is very, very low because it is so grueling and so unpleasant,  people don't want to go back to it," Bennett told reporters on "Face the  Nation," the Sunday morning news program.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Constructive Experience  </P> <P> Gillespie, while advocating tough discipline at the camp, said he wants Rose  Valley to be a constructive experience.  </P> <P> The camp, for instance, has a wood shop called "Santa's Workshop," where  inmates use scrap lumber to make hobbyhorses and trains for needy children. In  the cafeteria, inmates are allowed to serve themselves and may return for  seconds. Visits from relatives may last three hours and can include a "simple  kiss and hug," according to posted rules, "but definitely not more avid  contact."  </P> <P> Most of all, Gillespie said, the inmates can take satisfaction in having spent  40,000 hours since August renovating the facility, which until 1972 was a U.S.  Navy training base for Seabees. Framed color photos posted in front of the  barracks show the mess that was cleared by the inmates, whose work was  estimated to have saved the county $2 million to $3 million.  </P> <P> "I'm proud of you," Gillespie told about a dozen inmates who were standing at  military attention the other day.  </P> <P> "Thank you, sir," one of them barked.  </P> <P> Add neatly mowed lawns, flower beds, welcome mats in front of the bunk houses  and hundreds of swallows darting back and forth in the soft breeze and, well,  if you gotta do time. . . .  </P> <P> "This is the place," said Mike Holmes, 23, of Port Hueneme, who completes his  sentence in two weeks. "They expect a little more out of you, but you can't  beat the view."  </P></p>

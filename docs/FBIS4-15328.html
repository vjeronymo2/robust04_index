			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Anatol Awcharenka] </F>   [Excerpts] My visit to Minsk was extremely positive. This  is how UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali assessed his  meetings, negotiations, and talks [in Belarus], speaking at a  conference with journalists at the National Press Center on 7  April. In the course of a three-day visit, seven concrete  issues were discussed at different levels with a Foreign  Ministry delegation, at the Council of Ministers, and the  Supreme Soviet. All of these issues are very important and  urgent for Belarus, but the primary one is the problem stemming  from the Chernobyl catastrophe. Mr. Butrus-Ghali arrived in our  country to see what Chernobyl is, in reality. It is no secret  that some countries are displaying weariness and losing interest  in Chernobyl's problems. I am sure that the Belarusian side  managed to provide the secretary general with convincing data  contained in both the national report on Chernobyl and a special  memorandum. These documents provide the most recent figures,  the most current information. [passage omitted]    In the course of talks, both sides discussed measures to be  taken to prevent the world community from reducing its  involvement in alleviating the consequences of the Chernobyl  accident. However, as was underlined at a news conference held  by Belarusian Foreign Minister Pyotr Krawchanka, it will be  impossible to fully eliminate the aftermath of the accident in  this century.    The Belarusian side can also consider the general  secretary's  visit a success because it was attended by the director of the  Economic Commission for European Affairs. His participation in  the negotiations was not coincidental. In my opinion, his  arrival in Belarus demonstrated to our government that the  United Nations is ready to help Belarus survive its transitional  phase and integrate into the world, or at least the European  economy. Mr. Butrus-Ghali suggested that our Republic take part  in peacekeeping operations in various regions of the world. The  general secretary said: We would be very grateful to you if  Belarus could provide at least a small contingent of blue  helmets. He was told that under current legislation, only the  Supreme Soviet can decree Belarusian servicemen's participation  in operations outside the Republic. If the situation were to  change, we could assist the United Nations in keeping peace  around the world.    The UN and Belarusian delegations also discussed the  situation of Belarusian ethnic minorities in Latvia and Estonia.  Mr. Butrus-Ghali treats this problem very seriously, and that  is why the two sides agreed that the Laotian envoy, who is the  UN Supreme Commissary, will come to Minsk and receive data on  this complex problem, which is persistently plaguing us. The  envoy will then visit the Baltic states to contribute to  resolving the problem of national minorities, including  Belarusians, in Latvia and Estonia.

			<p><P> February 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FUTURE STOCK;  </P> <P> UCLA FRESHMAN DARRICK MARTIN WILL LEAD CHANGING OF THE GUARD  </P> <P> Bemoaning a starting lineup that includes two rookies, UCLA basketball Coach  Jim Harrick told a Seattle reporter last week: "You can hide one freshman, but  you can't hide two."  </P> <P> What's to hide?  </P> <P> Don MacLean, UCLA's leading scorer and No. 2 rebounder, has been one of the  Bruins' most consistent players.  </P> <P> And, in the month since he replaced Kevin Williams in the starting lineup,  Darrick Martin has emerged as a star of the future.  </P> <P> Though he was held scoreless and without a shot last week at Washington State,  the elusive Martin averaged 11.5 points, 4 assists, 2 rebounds and 2 steals  last month while making 62.5% of his shots and 71.4% of his free throws.  </P> <P> Last Saturday at Washington, in the best of his 8 games as a starter, he made 9  of 10 shots and scored a season-high 22 points in a 93-74 Bruin victory.  </P> <P> "We don't have a lot of guys like that in the league," Washington Coach Andy  Russo said of the 5-foot-11, 160-pound Martin. "He's real small and quick and  can really get to the basket. He reminds me a lot of Nate Archibald."  </P> <P> And destined to be even better, Russo said.  </P> <P> "I don't know if UCLA will benefit from Pooh Richardson's graduation, but I can  promise you Darrick Martin will benefit from it because he'll be able to play  his true position," Russo said.  </P> <P> "He's the consummate point guard in that it will be impossible to press UCLA.  Second of all, he's quick enough to defend and he's a very smart player who  will make sure they run their offense.  </P> <P> "He's a guy they'll be able to hang their hat on for 3 more years and not have  to worry about many of the things a lot of us have to worry about in terms of  leadership and floor generalship."  </P> <P> Truth be known, Harrick is delighted to have Martin.  </P> <P> "I kind of think that he's going to win a lot of games for us before he's  through," Harrick said.  </P> <P> Harrick calls him "incredibly poised for a freshman."  </P> <P> Martin, who skipped the seventh grade at New Life Baptist School in Lynwood and  won't be 18 until the week before the Pacific 10 Conference tournament next  month, almost didn't make it to UCLA.  </P> <P> A high school All-American at St. Anthony High in Long Beach, he signed a  letter of intent with the Bruins in the fall of 1987, turning down offers from  Nevada Las Vegas, Arizona and Duke. Martin was enamored of Duke, but chose to  stay close to his family, which lives in Compton.  </P> <P> He is especially close to the older of his two brothers, Andre, 16, who is  learning disabled with autistic traits.  </P> <P> "He's the main reason Darrick stayed (in Los Angeles)," Martin's father, Jesse,  said of Andre. "Darrick feels a very strong commitment to his brother -- to  allow him to share and participate in the things he has an opportunity to  (experience)."  </P> <P> Coincidentally, the day after Martin signed, his father, who works for IBM, was  offered a job in Charlotte, N.C., which is about a 3-hour drive from the Duke  campus at Durham, N.C.  </P> <P> "I didn't even have the heart to tell Coach K.," Martin said of Duke Coach Mike  Krzyzewski. "If it would have happened a little earlier, I might have ended up  at Duke."  </P> <P> Then, upset about learning of UCLA's firing of former Coach Walt Hazzard from a  televised news report, Martin attempted to have his letter of intent  invalidated.  </P> <P> Before he signed, Martin said, he was told by Athletic Director Pete Dalis that  Hazzard would not be fired.  </P> <P> Rebuffed in his effort to have his letter of intent invalidated, Martin  considered attending a junior college for a year, or sitting out this season at  another major college. Ultimately, though, he decided to abide by his letter  after he and his father had met with Harrick, Dalis, Chancellor Charles Young  and Vice Chancellor Elwin Svenson.  </P> <P> He's glad that he did.  </P> <P> "I'm very comfortable with my situation," Martin said. "I enjoy going to school  here, I enjoy the social life and I enjoy basketball."  </P> <P> Not everything has gone strictly according to plan, though.  </P> <P> Three days before the start of the season, his right foot was run over by a car  driven by Chanel Landreaux, a junior at UCLA and daughter of UCLA assistant  coach Paul Landreaux. Fortunately, the accident resulted only in a bruise.  </P> <P> Still, Martin started the season as UCLA's third guard. He blossomed as a  starter -- "I'm playing more relaxed," he said -- but then came the forgettable  game at Washington State. Afterward, he phoned his mother, Pam, who told him:  "You never played like that, even when you were little."  </P> <P> Mostly, though, Martin has proven to be a productive partner for senior guard  Pooh Richardson.  </P> <P> "It's beginning to be just like high school for me," he said.  </P> <P> Martin is a charismatic figure on the court, smiling and prodding the crowd by  throwing his fists into the air. Martin has the ability to develop into one of  the country's best point guards, Harrick said.  </P> <P> "I haven't seen many guys that can handle him," Harrick said. "Nobody's been  able to press him. I don't remember anybody stealing the ball from him."  </P> <P> Last month, when Richardson got into foul trouble in an 84-75 loss at Stanford,  Martin took control of the offense, contributing 15 points and a season-high 6  assists and scoring on several acrobatic drives.  </P> <P> "He went to the hole on them about four times -- just blew by," Harrick said.  "In fact, he invented a play. The forward came across like he's supposed to and  he just waved at him. 'Get out of the way.' He juked (Terry) Taylor and went to  the basket and got fouled.  </P> <P> "He came over to the bench and said, 'They can't stop me.' "  </P> <P> Even if he is a freshman.  </P> <P> Bruin Notes  </P> <P> A blood test Wednesday showed that Don MacLean does not have mononucleosis,  according to his mother, Pat. MacLean lost more than 10 pounds last month as  UCLA played six of eight games on the road. Results of two other blood tests  will be known today, she said. . . . UCLA, which is 12-5 overall and 7-2 in the  Pacific 10 Conference, will play Oregon (7-11, 2-6) at 7:30 tonight at Pauley  Pavilion. UCLA beat Oregon last month at Eugene, Ore., 97-66. . . . Coach Jim  Harrick, contrasting UCLA's 2 victories in the Northwest last week: "When you  watched us at Washington, you saw a clinic. But when you watched us at  Washington State, you laughed." Or cried.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Maroni: `I Am the Only Candidate'"] </F>   [Text] Rome -- "The basic problem is: `Do you trust the  League or not?" This is how [Northern League lower house floor  leader] Roberto Maroni put the matter: handing over the  Viminale [Interior Ministry] to the Bandwagon [League nickname]  was a question of trust. He then added: "I am the only  candidate for the Interior Ministry. No other name was ever  mentioned during the discussions. And there are no objections  from the Quirinale [office of the president]"    The League is therefore insisting on having the "qualified  ministries." Maroni explained why: "If we had wanted to raise  the price, we would have already concluded the negotiations, and  we would have been given six or seven ministries." The League  has really turned the Viminale into its Piave line [World War I  defense line]: "Given that no other name has been mentioned,  they must explain to us why they are refusing to give us this  political presence. The League will convene its group tomorrow  (today -- LA REPUBBLICA editor's note) and will make a decision."    The bandwagon's number two said that the allies had offered  the League the Labor Ministry -- an offer which was apparently  declined: "We would have been open to the objection that a  representative of ours in this ministry might have furthered the  North's interests, rather than those of the bridge over the  [Messina] Straight." According to Maroni, apart from the  Viminale, the Bandwagon is aiming for the Treasury, Industry,  and Budget ministries. This, however, is not because it is  power-thirsty: "We are not interested," Maroni further  explained, "in so many ministries or in obtaining as much power  as possible. We are interested in ensuring that the League's  presence in the government is such as to enable us to fulfill an  effective political role on the issues around which the League  was created and for which the League has fought for the past 15  years."    For his part, League Senate floor leader Francesco Speroni  was sarcastic about the League's ally: "Seeing how Mandela  treats De Klerk, I think it is easier to talk to Mandela than to  Berlusconi."    As regards the difficulties involved in the negotiations, it  was Maroni who concluded: "A government will be formed in any  case. As far as we are concerned, this parliament will result  in a government. We are committed to this."</p>

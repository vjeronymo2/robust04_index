			<p><P> August 5, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RECLAIMING CARTS FROM THE HOMELESS  </P> <P> I read your article on Viva Mart's reclaiming of its shopping carts with  concern and confusion.  </P> <P> I understand that the homeless have a need.  </P> <P> At least the homeless who are victims of circumstance and not homeless by  choice.  </P> <P> However, the shopping carts represent a financial investment on the part of the  supermarket. They are purchased for use by the customers of that market.  </P> <P> Once removed from the property of the market without their permission, the cart  is stolen property. When did it become illegal to reclaim stolen property?  </P> <P> If a homeless person puts their possessions in my car, does that make the car  theirs? Am I subject to a lawsuit by Legal Aid if I remove their belongings and  reclaim my car?  </P> <P> Some good will came out of the situation because the market will be working  with the homeless. Good by virtue of blackmail, however, is not what this  country is supposed to be all about. They had no right to the carts, and by  threatening a lawsuit and the attending publicity, Legal Aid blackmailed the  market into cooperation.  </P> <P> K.A. GRIMES  </P> <P> Westminster  </P></p>

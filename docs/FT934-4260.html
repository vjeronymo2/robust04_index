			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / International Company News: BCE pays Dollars 275m for stake in US cable TV BCE, Canada's biggest company, has finally sold its financial services and property interests and is investing in US cable TV in preparation for the multi-media age. BCE will now be solely a telecommunications group with large international interests in the Americas, Europe and Asia. It controls 54 per cent of Northern Telecom, the international equipment make. 'Our policy is to pursue leadership in telecommunications,' said Mr Lynton Wilson, chairman. The group is paying USDollars 275m for 30 per cent of Jones Intercable, a Colorado-based cable TV operator with a subscriber base of 1.3m homes in 24 states and cable investment in the UK and Spain. BCE has an option to take 51 per cent of Jones and will invest in its expansion. BCE said the move gives it a major presence in the US home entertainment market without making a 'blockbuster investment of the kind that some US telephone companies have made'. It already has cable TV investments in the UK. In addition BCE has sold its fully-owned loss-making financial services unit, Montreal Trustco, Canada's fourth biggest trust company, to the Bank of Novia Scotia for nearly CDollars 300m in the bank's stock. The deal includes all MT assets and liabilities except CDollars 100m of office buildings. BCE is expected to sell the bank shares and the office buildings. It paid CDollars 1bn for MT in 1989 as a diversification, including a recent capital infusion. It will take a CDollars 400m write-down to cover its losses on the deal. BCE is disposing of its remaining property interests to Carena, a Hees-Edper holding company, for a nominal sum. This will require a CDollars 350m write-down. BCE's total write-offs for 1993, including CDollars 940m for its share of Northern Telecom special charges, will total almost CDollars 1.7bn.</p>

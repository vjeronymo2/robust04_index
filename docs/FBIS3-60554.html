			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] President Robinson yesterday called for more  straight talking about AIDS to ensure that young people know how  to protect themselves against it.    She expressed concern that young people from the West of  Ireland who are thinking of emigrating do not have adequate  information about the disease.    Latest figures show that AIDS has claimed the lives of 162  Irish people, while more than 1,400 have tested HIV-positive.    On a visit to AIDS Health West in Galway, a voluntary  organisation of which she is a patron, President Robinson said  too many young people were leaving Mayo, Galway, Donegal and  Sligo ``at risk of their lives'' because of ignorance.</p>

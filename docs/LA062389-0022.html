			<p><P> June 23, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> FNN FANS WOULD RATHER FIGHT THAN SWITCH TO NEW NETWORK;  </P> <P> LOYAL VIEWERS GET OFF THEIR SOFAS TO PROTEST WHEN BUSINESS NEWS SERVICE AXED  </P> <P> On paper, it seemed like the switch from Financial News Network to the Consumer  News and Broadcast Channel was a great move for cable operators.  </P> <P> CNBC, a 24-hour-a-day service which debuted nationwide April 17, was, as its  name implies, the product of no less a TV powerhouse than NBC. It featured  seasoned hosts such as Dick Cavett, a huge bankroll -- reportedly $65 million  -- to see it through a building period and the kind of market research  projections that programmers dreams about.  </P> <P> Unlike FNN, an 8-year-old service specializing in hard-core stock market and  commodities coverage, CNBC was created to appeal to the everyday consumer  seeking guidance in making major purchases as well as dabbling in the sport of  the 1980s -- investments.  </P> <P> "They had surveys and research, done by an independent researcher, that showed  that even the viewers who watched FNN regularly would prefer CNBC," said Tom  Belcher, general manager of West Valley Cablevision, a system serving 75,000  homes in the San Fernando Valley.  </P> <P> The researchers, however, never spoke to Geri Pearlman. All the demographic  studies and the graphs and charts meant nothing to her on that morning that  West Valley Cablevision switched, unannounced, to CNBC. She let them know,  loudly and often, that she wanted her FNN.  </P> <P> "I'm just a homemaker," said Pearlman, who lives with her husband in West  Hills, "but when I turned on the TV that morning and my FNN was gone, I got  hysterical. . . . It turned me from a couch potato who used to watch the  markets with my poodle in my lap, into a wild-eyed activist."  </P> <P> Officials at West Valley Cablevision said their decision to switch from FNN to  CNBC was made neither to save money nor because the company had any vested  interests in the new service. "If fact, we had to pay CNBC twice as much, per  subscriber, than we had to pay FNN," Belcher said. Cablevision officials would  not disclose figures, but according to FNN President David Meister, his service  charges cable operators 3 1/2 cents per subscriber while CNBC charges 7 cents.  </P> <P> Belcher said that rumors about West Valley Cablevision owning a piece of CNBC  arose because of a confusion over names. There is a system also called  Cablevision on Long Island, N.Y., that has a vested interest in CNBC, but it  has no connection to Cablevision Industries, the industry giant that has about  950,000 subscribers nationwide on 85 different systems, including West Valley  Cablevision.  </P> <P> "We were very impressed with what we saw of CNBC before they launched," said  David Testa, a Cablevision Industries vice president, speaking from the home  office in Liberty, N.Y. "That was the sole reason we wanted it. It's a very  good service and we think it will have broad appeal for our subscribers."  </P> <P> Locally, Belcher said he believed CNBC would garner a lot of attention and help  attract new subscribers in the West Valley, where the system has signed up just  over 40% of the potential customers in its area.  </P> <P> It turned out to be the old subscribers they had to worry about. On CNBC's  launch day, all the Cablevision Industries systems made the switch without  warning to their customers. "We usually announce any change at least 30 days in  advance," Belcher said, "but we were afraid if we disclosed our plans FNN might  quit us right away and our subscribers would be left without a cable financial  channel until CNBC started up."  </P> <P> Pearlman, the faithful FNN watcher, reacted immediately. "I started calling  everyone I could think of," she said. One of the people she reached was  Belcher. "The calls started coming in that very first day," he said, shaking  his head and smiling. "Lots of calls."  </P> <P> FNN, with headquarters in Los Angeles and New York, had built up a great deal  of loyalty in its eight years of coverage centering on stock exchanges and  other money markets. According to Pearlman, one stock trader in the West Valley  felt the service was so crucial to his livelihood that he bought a satellite  dish to pull in FNN.  </P> <P> The protest was not confined to money market professionals, however. "I can't  say I really play the market," Pearlman said, "but my husband has some  retirement income that we worry about and we have the ability to move it  around. We based a lot of our decisions on the things I would hear about on  FNN."  </P> <P> Indeed, Pearlman, who leaves FNN on during the day even when she is just  puttering around the house, said she made one of her most crucial financial  decisions of her life based on what she heard on the channel.  </P> <P> "You know the market crash on October 19, 1987, on a Monday?," she asked.  "Well, on the Friday before that I was watching the ticker on FNN and listening  to the things the people on the station and the guests talked about. It wasn't  anything they said directly, but I just got a feeling. I pulled my money out of  the stock market, all of it.  </P> <P> "When the market crashed on Monday we were out."  </P> <P> Belcher asked those who wrote or called to be patient, to give CNBC a chance.  CNBC, feeling the heat of protests from different parts of the country,  modified their morning programming.  </P> <P> One significant addition was a second on-screen ticker to give constant updates  on the American and regional stock exchange prices. (The existing ticker gave  prices on the New York Stock Exchange.) CNBC also added twice-an-hour updates  on money market indexes. Both the second feature and the updates had been on  FNN for years.  </P> <P> "We are a brand-new service and we are still evolving," said Jim Boyle,  spokesman for CNBC, headquartered in Fort Lee, N.J. "Our mandate is to be a  much broader service than FNN, but we wanted to provide information to keep FNN  watchers comfortable with us. Once they take a look at us we think they will be  very happy with the service."  </P> <P> In the meantime, Pearlman had organized two meetings of a group she called  Subscribers Allied for Viewing Excellence, or SAVE. They had two meetings, each  of which was attended by 50 Cablevision subscribers, she said. SAVE members  acknowledged that there had been changes at CNBC, but they still longed for  FNN.  </P> <P> "You get used to the on-air people," Pearlman said. "That's the main thing. You  get so that you know them, trust them."  </P> <P> "That is the one thing we could not change," said Belcher, who had high praise  for Pearlman and the other protesters. "They had what they felt was a  legitimate concern and they went about it the right way. They are intelligent,  eloquent people who were willing to listen to our side of the story. It was  truly a grass-roots movement."  </P> <P> On June 8, after conferring with his home office, Belcher called Pearlman to  tell her that West Valley Cablevision was keeping CNBC, but that it was also  going to put FNN back on a separate channel from midnight to 4:30 p.m., long  enough for full stock exchange coverage. In return, he asked her to call off  planned picketing of the West Valley Cablevision offices. Pearlman readily  agreed.  </P> <P> FNN rejoined the West Valley Cablevision lineup on June 12 and FNN officials  were, of course, delighted. Meister said several other cable operators have  restored FNN, including ones in Las Vegas; Springfield, Mo.; Westchester  County, N.Y.; and Oakland County, Mich.  </P> <P> Officials at CNBC said they were not at all dismayed with the decision. They  said they are glad to be on Cablevision Industries systems and are sure, with  time, that their operation will prove popular to a wider audience than FNN's.  </P> <P> The only partial loser in the battle is West Valley Cablevision. "We have a  limited amount of channel space, so we don't like to duplicate services,"  Belcher said. "Now I have two cable financial channels and I am paying three  times what I was before."  </P> <P> But all the time he was saying this, Belcher was smiling.  </P> <P> "The important thing is that the customers are happy and I think that  eventually having CNBC will help us. But if I had to do this all over again, I  don't think we would have made the switch."  </P></p>

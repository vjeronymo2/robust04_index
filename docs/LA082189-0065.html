			<p><P> August 21, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 2 BADLY BURNED IN PLANE CRASH;  </P> <P> AIRCRAFT SLAMS INTO FIELD, ERUPTS IN FLAMES JUST AFTER TAKEOFF  </P> <P> Two Orange County residents were critically burned Sunday when their small  plane crashed just after takeoff from Long Beach Municipal Airport and was  engulfed by flames.  </P> <P> Pilot Angelo Calderone, 65, of Los Alamitos and his passenger, Delores Hartley,  44, of Costa Mesa, were taken to Memorial Hospital of Long Beach in "extremely  critical condition" with second- and third-degree burns over most of their  bodies, hospital officials said.  </P> <P> Calderone suffered burns over 60% of his body.  </P> <P> Hartley, who later Sunday was transferred to the burn unit at UCI Medical  Center in Orange, suffered burns over 90% of her body.  </P> <P> Investigators from the Federal Aviation Administration were looking into the  cause of the crash Sunday, and officials from the National Transportation  Safety Board were expected to join the inquiry today.  </P> <P> But a Long Beach Fire Department official who was at the scene said their  investigators believe Calderone's single-engine plane, a Piper Tomahawk, was  hit by a strong gust of wind just after he took off from Runway 25L.  </P> <P> As the plane's stall buzzer sounded, Calderone reacted properly, bringing the  nose of the airplane down, Fire Department spokesman Bob Caldon said. But then  Calderone apparently lost control of the plane and, at 1:27 p.m. Sunday, it  slammed nose first into a field near the runway.  </P> <P> Immediately after the crash, flames shot out of the engine compartment, raced  into the cockpit and burned onto the right wing, Caldon said.  </P> <P> Twenty-five firefighters responded from a station one-eighth of a mile from the  airport. They sprayed foam on the flames, "popping the door" on Calderone's  side and dragging him out of the plane, Caldon said. But Hartley was trapped  inside as the plane continued to burn.  </P> <P> Finally, using a Jaws of Life hydraulic prying device, firefighters were able  to cut Hartley out of airplane, Caldon said.  </P> <P> Calderone was taken by Lifeflight helicopter to Memorial, where he was admitted  to the intensive-care unit. Hartley was transported by ambulance to Memorial,  then transferred to UCI Medical Center.  </P> <P> "She'll get better care there," Memorial spokesman Ron Yukelson said. "We don't  have a burn-specific unit."  </P> <P> Caldon said controllers in the Long Beach airport's observation tower watched  the plane crash Sunday.  </P> <P> Both he and an FAA spokesman said they did not know where the small plane was  going or how much experience Calderone has as a pilot.  </P> <P> Neither Calderone nor Hartley was able to explain what led to the crash, but on  the way to the hospital, Caldon said, Hartley talked a little, mentioning to  paramedics that "she heard the (stall) buzzer sounding just before the  accident."  </P></p>

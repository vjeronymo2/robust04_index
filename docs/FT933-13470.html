			<p>930719 FT  19 JUL 93 / Leading Article: Japanese confusion THE JAPANESE election result contains no big surprises, at least for those who have followed recent opinion polls. The Liberal Democratic party which has governed the country since 1955 has lost its overall majority, but remains easily the largest party. In fact its relative dominance has been increased by the collapse of the Social Democratic party, hitherto the main opposition. The three new parties advocating political reform have done well  -especially Mr Tsutomu Hata's Japan Renewal party - but their success has been gained more at the SDP's expense than at the government's. Clearly the SDP's themes and style, essentially those of the old left, no longer seem relevant to those Japanese voters who are keenest for political change. The short-term outcome will almost certainly be a coalition led by the LDP and including one or more of the new parties. But it may take weeks to emerge, as there is bound to be intense bargaining over both policies and cabinet posts. Meanwhile Japan has reported a big increase in its trade surplus during the first half of this year. A period of political uncertainty at this point will be irritating to its trading partners, since Japan will presumably lack a government with the authority either to make new trade agreements or to pre-empt foreign pressure with measures to boost domestic demand such as cuts in income tax and in interest rates - which would be far preferable to agreements on specific imports. Balance of power But even that consequence is not certain. During the election campaign the outgoing Miyazawa government, generally perceived as a discredited lame duck, defied conventional wisdom by reaching both multi- and bi-lateral trade agreements. One of the biggest problems for outsiders dealing with Japan is, precisely, to discern where power really lies. The present system neither reflects the real relationship between different centres of power, nor gives effective voice to the changing balance of sentiments and aspirations among the population. The election campaign, including that of the reformers, illustrated all too clearly how opaque and idiosyncratic Japan's political style remains. Consequently one of the main hopes from any reform must be that it will bring greater transparency, as well as greater decisiveness. A more transparently run Japan would be easier to understand and to do business with. A more decisively run Japan would be better equipped to deal with the structural blemishes on its economy, and to confront the external challenges the country now faces: the changing relationship with a US which may not be so committed to holding the security ring in Asia for ever; the evolving foreign and defence policy challenges in Asia itself; and the pressure for Japan to match its economic power with a stronger international role. Political division The question is what bearing the election result has on all this. The heavy socialist losses and the success of the new pro-reform parties do at least suggest that the old left-right divide in politics is being replaced by a new fault line between conservatives and modernisers. But that will not quickly, or perhaps ever, be reflected in a clear-cut division between political parties. Not all the conservatives are in the LDP, and by no means all the reformers are in the new parties. Indeed, perhaps the greatest danger to the interests of reform lies in the possibility that the LDP's electoral performance - in all the circumstances a remarkably resilient one  -might strengthen the hand of conservatives within the party. And a resumption of faster growth could easily boost support for the LDP again, thus leaving in place the cosy bureaucracy/business condominium which has ruled Japan since the 1950s. One effect of this would probably be further defections from the LDP, in the midst of a bitter argument about electoral reform. The parallel with recent events in Italy is obvious, and not necessarily encouraging. Indeed, in one respect Japan has moved closer to the pre-reform Italian situation: its dominant party will now be racked not only by internal faction-fights but also by constant wrangling with coalition partners. At best, Japan will gradually conjure from this confusion a more efficient and more genuinely representative political system. But it will hardly do so quickly, and maybe not at all.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone report by correspondent Joao Ligio in Lusaka] </F>   [Text] The proceedings at the Lusaka peace talks this week  is seen as one of the most difficult stages in the second round  of the talks. For the first time, National Union for the Total  Independence of Angola [UNITA] has complied with its promise to  present its response to the first proposal, which sought to  narrow differences concerning the specific principles that will  govern the national reconciliation process. In practice, it  turned a blind eye to the protocols and understandings that have  already been reached.    UNITA wants three of the government's six key ministries; it  wants provincial governments to have autonomous powers and their  own police forces; it wants participation in all strategic  companies, including the National Angolan Fuel Company,  Sonangol, and the Angola National Diamond Enterprise, Endiama,  which are viewed as preferred targets. It wants public  competition for a new symbol of the Republic and a new national  anthem. It wants immunity for its men and diplomatic passports,  and it wants its property returned.    The government team to the talks was called this afternoon  to  respond to UNITA's position. It admitted that it might make  some concessions, but it described the document as contradicting  the principles that have already been signed.</p>

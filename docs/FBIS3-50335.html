It seems that these organizations have  serious disagreements. This is what we learned from one of the  activists -- interviewed by our correspondents -- of the  Hungarian National Front [Magyar Nemzeti Arcvonal, MNA], which  has already been announced as a movement. Istvan Gyorkos, whose  Nazi activities were noted by the authorities and who was  sentenced by the court to suspended imprisonment for incitement  against the community in 1993, is the "national commander" of  the MNA. We interviewed the leader of the MNA's youth group in  Budapest. His name is known to our editorial staff but he  wished to preserve his anonomity in the interview in which he  spoke about the extreme right-wing movements in Hungary, their  connections and operation.    On 21 November 1993, Istvan Gyorkos officially announced the  Hungarian National Front Movement at the court. As they do not  yet wish to function as a party, they do not need court  registration for their operation. As opposed to the VNP led by  Albert Szabo, the MNA considers itself to be the true Hungarist  [Hungarian Nazi] movement.    The Budapest party leader spoke about Gyorkos as the  successor of former Arrow Cross leader Ferenc Szalasi with legal  continuity. It is alleged that the former leader of the old  Arrow Cross Party who was living in Australia instructed Gyorkos  to organize and lead the new Hungarist movement. The MNA is a  nationwide organization. As its activist stated, the Hungarist  movement has regional leaders and it is led by a so-called  leading core. "We do not have any membership, we only have  supporters in all large cities of the country. We also have  influence on a number of social organizations, for example the  National Guard Federation [Nemzetor Szovetseg], the scout  troops, and the National Federation of Political Prisoners  [POFOSZ]," he said. The MNA is mainly supported by the younger  and older skinheads and it already has a propaganda group.    In Hungary, the skinhead group called Szalasi Guard is also  based on Arrow Cross traditions. Its leader, just as our  interviewee, was one of the accused in the court case of  skinheads relating to the incident at Dobrentei square. Our  interviewee knows them but he distances himself from them  because, as he says, the Szalasi Guard is too aggressive and  simple: "All they do is keep drawing arrow crosses on walls."    His views on the VNP are even more bleak. He knows Albert  Szabo, its leader, because after his return from Australia,  Szabo got in touch with Gyorkos. He is supposed to have been  instructed by the Australian Arrow Cross membership to help the  MNA's party building work. However, instead, Szabo started to  "build his own career on separate ways." Szabo deceives the  unsuspecting young people, the skinheads. Istvan Gyorkos is  accepted throughout the world but even the Australian Arrow  Cross membership has distanced itself from Szabo, our  interviewee claimed.    According to our interviewee, Albert Szabo has often  received  cash from the editor of the NAPKELET journal. He also asked for  financial help from Australia but he was refused. Gyorkos's  group did not support him financially, although, according to  the activist, it could have. The MNA receives money from the  Australian Arrow Cross membership, from its wealthier members.  In fact, they even have enterprises: They want to publish and  sell books, bumper stickers, and T-shirts.    They also have foreign connections. They know the American  and West European neo-Nazis. "They think in terms of  international national socialism, but the MNA first has to  become strong in Hungary. We no longer distribute the militant  national socialist bulletin called NEW ORDER which is made in  the United States," our interviewee said. We also have links  with extreme right-wingers in Russia, namely with the Pamyat  radical nationalist organization.    According to reports, at the meetings of the VNP, Szabo  denied the Holocaust and the destruction of Jews in the Second  World War. The MNA's youth leader also accepts this view and  treats it as a historic fact. However, he does not deal with  this issue because "Hungarian issues are more important for the  MNA."</p>

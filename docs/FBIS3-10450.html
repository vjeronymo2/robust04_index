			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Daniel Ortega, Sandinist National Liberation </F> Front, FSLN, Secretary General, by Maite Rico in Madrid; date  not given; first paragraph is EL PAIS introduction]    [Text] Madrid--Daniel Ortega, 49, is dressed in severe  black, an austerity broken only by a crimson scarf. The  commander appears to have retired those thick glasses that used  to cover his oriental eyes. He arrived in Spain last week on an  invitation from the University of Castellon, and he has taken  the opportunity to meet with Spanish Foreign Minister Javier  Solana and various opposition leaders.    [Rico] In the past year, Nicaragua has undergone an  escalation of actions by armed groups leading to political  tensions. Is the country becoming polarized again?    [Ortega] Politically speaking, despite the confrontations,  the polarization that led to the war has gradually subsided.  There is better understanding than there has been in years.  Nevertheless, we are going through a period of radicalization as  a result of the economic policy, unemployment (we have a 60  percent jobless rate), poverty, pressure on the productive  sectors.... In the past four years, the neoliberalism of Violeta  Chamorro's government has aggravated the recession.    [Rico] What alternatives does the Sandinist National  Liberation Front (FSLN) propose?    [Ortega] We would have to begin with a national gathering of  all political, business, and labor organizations at which the  government would present the preliminary agreements it has  entered into with the World Bank and the International Monetary  Fund, so that the various sectors can express their opinions.  What is being negotiated with these agencies are structural  adjustments that will be binding on the country in future years.    [Rico] The honeymoon between the Chamorro government and the  Sandinist Front has been eclipsed in recent months. Has the  "cohabitation" arrangement that emerged after the 1990 elections  been abandoned?    [Ortega] The situation has not been so linear; there have  been ups and downs. The Sandinist Front has engaged in an  opposition of constructive criticism, of coming down hard on the  government when it proposes destabilizing measures and  supporting it when we agree with its proposals. Right now, for  example, we agree on the need to make common cause vis-a-vis the  international organizations and on promoting constitutional  reforms.    [Rico] Yet Violeta Chamorro has accused you of destabilizing  the country: She has even said that you went through a  "psychosis" because you could not accept your electoral defeat.    [Ortega] (Ortega smiles.) She said I was crazy. And she has  said that several times. You have to understand that Mrs.  Chamorro is not involved in the internal affairs of the country.  She is a symbolic figure, the widow of Pedro Joaquin. It is the  members of her cabinet who are in charge, and they are in the  best position to assess what we Sandinists have done. We have  cooperated when they have not asked us to.    [Rico] The game of alliances among political groups in  Nicaragua has evolved since 1990: The pact between the  Sandinists and the government has given rise to recent contacts  between you and the National Opposition Union (UNO), leaving the  government out. Everyone talks of the need for a general accord  for the good of the country, but in fact it looks more like a  dance for the distribution of power.    [Ortega] You have to look at the results. We have in fact  been in contact with the UNO, not secretly, but in the open. And  in November we began discussing constitutional reform with them.  That step laid the groundwork for UNO deputies to rejoin the  National Assembly. The results have been positive.    [Rico] Some groups of former combatants (Sandinists and  Contras) are still active. Has the policy of reintegration  failed?    [Ortega] These outbreaks are linked to the economic-social  crisis. These people are ex-soldiers and demoralized peasants.  The government signed agreements with them for land grants and  aid, and it has reneged. The only way to solve this problem is  to fulfill these commitments.    [Rico] One of the issues that has raised the most hackles in  your country is the government's desire to remove the Army from  the Sandinist orbit, which entails forcing your brother, General  Humberto Ortega, to step down as defense minister.    [Ortega] That is a matter that has already reached the point  of inflection, because we are pushing it through legislative  channels so that it will not be influenced by external pressure.  A bill to amend the law on the Army has already been sent to the  executive branch, which will determine the time frame for  changes in the Armed Forces. I estimate they will begin early  next year.    [Rico] Will they accept this law?    [Ortega] Yes. No one denies that the comrades who are in the  Army and the police are Sandinist comrades and revolutionaries,  but they subordinate their actions to the Constitution and the  government.    [Rico] Nicaragua will hold elections in 1996. Could Somozism  reemerge as positions become radicalized?    [Ortega] The Somozists in fact already have something going  in the form of the Constitutionalist Liberal Party, led by  Arnaldo Guzman, which is very powerful. The Somozists were in  power for more than 40 years; they established a social base and  grew out of a historic party, the Liberal Party. And now they  are reemerging under the banner of liberalism. They are  Sandinism's principal adversaries. That is why we feel we must  promote a very broad policy of alliances, a program of national  unity.    [Rico] Would this alliance include the moderate sectors of  the UNO?    [Ortega] Yes. It would include all sectors who are willing  to  strengthen the continuity of the revolutionary program, with the  necessary adjustments, but always with a view to democratizing  the country.    [Rico] Given what has happened over the last four years, is  a  pact of this nature possible when the presidency of the country  is up for grabs?    [Ortega] Nicaragua has to come first, and any personal  interests have to come second, or last.    [Rico] Is that possible, then?    [Ortega] Sure it is possible.</p>

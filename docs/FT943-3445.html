			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / Business and the Environment: A case of green gains - David Lascelles on the savings to be made through efficiency If being green were good for business, it would presumably happen of its own accord. So why is there not more of it? The Institute of Business Ethics believes that the best way to get the message across is by citing case studies of companies which have gained by being green. A new publication* this week, Benefiting Business and the Environment, describes 70 environmental initiatives taken by 43 companies in the UK. Some of the companies are multinationals, such as Esso and National Westestminster Bank. Others are tiny enterprises. The total annual savings represented by the studies are more than Pounds 10m with an average payback of 18 months. 'Thus,' say the authors, 'the potential for savings in the UK as a whole is vast.' Many of the savings came through energy efficiency. Forte, the hotel group, saved Pounds 180,000 in 1993 by installing combined heat and power systems in 60 hotels. A more ambitious scheme came at Blue Circle, the cement maker, which used several of its disused quarries for landfill and built electricity generation plants at four of them to make use of the landfill gas they create. The plants generate enough electricity to serve a town the size of Salisbury, but require a government subsidy to make them economic. Spring Grove Services, which washes 34,000 washroom roller towels a week, plans to capture waste heat from the drying process to warm the factory. The installation cost Pounds 57,000 and Spring Grove hopes to save Pounds 12,000 a year on energy costs. Water saving is another theme. Arjo Wiggins Fine Papers in Dover has reduced water consumption and waste by nearly 50 per cent with savings of Pounds 270,000 on effluent charges and raw material costs over the last three years. Several case studies show how companies have saved money by identifying waste. Some go a stage further and turn it to advantage by recycling it. Triplex Safety Glass used to send all waste glass to landfill. Now it separates untreated glass for re-use to make patterned or wired glass products, while other glass which has been toughened or printed on is used as aggregate in cement and as reflective material in road-marking paint. The savings are put at Pounds 274,000 a year. Boots the Chemist carried out an audit which showed that it handles 70,000 tonnes of packaging a year. A saving exercise has cut out 70 tonnes of paper and board and 180 tonnes of plastic, and 27 tonnes of virgin pulp have been replaced by recycled fibre. At Procter &amp; Gamble, the switch to refill containers for detergents has cut out more than 11,000 tonnes of packaging over four years. Transport is a big cost for business. TNT Express has set a target of 12 to 17 per cent reductions in fuel use by applying the fruits of research into vehicle design and wider use of aerodynamic devices. Skippingdale Paper Products, which makes paper nappies, estimates it saves Pounds 195,000 a year in transportation costs by making a neater nappy. What is not clear from the report is what prompted these companies to go for such savings. Was it environmental concern, or more ordinary business motives? Many of the savings are in the area of fuel, water and landfill, all of which have risen sharply in cost in the last few years as a result of increased taxation or government regulation. It may be misleading, therefore, to infer that these savings have led to higher profitability: they may only have offset higher costs. Julie Hill, one of the authors of the report, says that she and her colleagues were not concerned about why the companies acted the way they did. What was important was the outcome: companies that operated less wastefully. *Benefiting business and the environment. Pounds 24. Institute of Business Ethics, 12 Palace Street, London SW1E 5JA.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tianjin, June 1 (XINHUA) -- China's third biggest  city Tianjin will be built into a commercial and trade center in  northern China through a 20-year effort, Gao Dezhan, secretary  of the municipal committee of the Communist Party of China,  recently told XINHUA.    Once known as the country's second biggest business and  banking center next to Shanghai, Tianjin is now taking a number  of forceful steps in an overall development strategy to restore  its prestige, the official said.    In the coming two years, Gao said, Tianjin will focus its  effort on building 10 more influential markets for banking,  labor, technology and information, real estate and enterprise  property transference.    So far it has built and put into operation some 28 national  and regional markets for various commodities and means of  production.    Tianjin will also boost the development of township  enterprises and overseas-funded joint ventures, he said, adding  that the pace of state-owned enterprise restructuring will be  quickened as well.    In addition, the city will accelerate the building of some  major projects such as the auto industrial company with an  annual output of 150,000 autos and the 140,000-ton ethylene and  200,000-ton polyester production plants. The construction of  the Tianjin seaside development area will also be accelerated.    Gao, past governor of northeast China's Jilin Province and  forestry minister, said Tianjin now has four major industries of  machinery, electronics, chemicals and metallurgy with an output  value accounting for 70 percent of the city's industrial total.    And by the year 1996, he said, the city's profit and tax are  expected to double the amount of last year, to exceed 11 billion  yuan.    In the development of China's Bohai Bay economic rim and the  Beijing-Tianjin economic ring, Tianjin will play an important  role, the official said.</p>

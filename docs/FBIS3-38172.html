			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Ankara--The two deputy chiefs of Turkey's National  Intelligence Organization (MIT) were reassigned on Monday [24  January] and will be serving this intelligence body abroad as of  now. Sources said no new appointments had yet taken place to  fill the seats of deputy MIT undersecretaries Emre Taner and  Ertugrul Guven. Guven was reassigned to a major European  country whereas Taner will be serving in the Mediterranean  region. Their new positions cannot be identified for security  reasons. TDN [TURKISH DAILY NEWS] sources said the reshuffle  would continue and two of the organization's most senior  department chiefs will soon be reappointed as well.    Intelligence sources said there was no change in the  position  of MIT undersecretary Sonmez Koksal. Koksal was appointed to  his position last year after serving his country for years as a  veteran diplomat, and there has been speculation since Prime  Minister Tansu Ciller took office that he would be removed under  pressure from hardliners from the military.    Koksal, Turkey's permanent representative at the Council of  Europe and former ambassador to Baghdad, was the first civilian  to be appointed as undersecretary of the MIT.    Last June, there were reports that hardline officials in the  organization had arranged to undermine his position on the  grounds that he represented moderation.    There was speculation that Ciller was prepared to start her  reshuffle in MIT by replacing Koksal with an army officer. Many  of the MIT's former employees are accustomed to strict military  discipline. The organization's headquarters in the Yenimahalle  District in Ankara is the second facility in the world where all  intelligence operatives live together. The first such example  was in the former Soviet Union, where the State Security Service  (KGB) literally controlled the entire daily life of its  operatives.    The compound is surrounded by high walls and guarded closely  by civilian and military officials armed with machine guns. One  of the problems for Koksal since the day of his appointment has  been the past role of the organization which he heads in the  buildups to military coups.    Despite a law which says the MIT chief is attached to the  prime minister and that the organization has no jurisdiction and  is authorized only to gather intelligence and/or prevent others  from doing the same on Turkey, this has not worked out in the  past.    Coming from within the ranks of the military, previous MIT  chiefs have always known where their priorities lay. Never has  any of them informed the civilian management of military  preparations to take over the country. The files of all of  their personnel have always been kept at the Chief of General  Staff's office instead of the civilian administration. It is  these files that affected their promotions and future  appointments. But sources have said that, with Koksal,  everything has started to change. Being a career diplomat, he  spoke more freely. He always distanced himself from the  mainframe military mentality. And, with his highly  sophisticated behavior, he managed to work in full harmony with  the civilian management.</p>

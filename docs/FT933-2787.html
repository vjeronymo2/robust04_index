			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / Danes cut discount rate by half point THE Danish central bank yesterday cut its discount rate half a point to 8.75 per cent, AP-DJ reports from Copenhagen. The krone remained steady at DKr4.11 to the D-Mark even after the rate cut. 'This cut in the discount rate is a visible signal to the rest of the world that the central bank is willing to lower rates,' said a senior banker. 'But it is a cosmetic positive signal because it is the repo (repurchase) rate which has more practical significance,' he added. The central bank said the related folio (deposit) rate would be lowered with immediate effect to 8.75 per cent. According to the central bank the rate cuts are 'a step towards continuation of the normalisation of interest rate levels'. One Copenhagen broker forecast a repo rate cut next week. Local analysts say that the rate cuts should have a neutral to good affect on the krone.</p>

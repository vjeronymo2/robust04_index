			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / Spain to speed up telecoms deregulation Spain has given a clear signal that it wants to keep abreast of the European Union's richer economies by waiving a five- year transition phase for the deregulation of its telecommunications sector and announcing that Telefonica's monopoly as a national operator will end on January 1 1998, as laid down by the European Commission's fast route timetable for the industry. Hailed as a 'leap forward of historic dimensions' by Mr Felipe Gonzalez, prime minister, the deregulation package drawn up by the government has Spain tracking the telecommunications sectors in France and in Germany and rejecting the slower liberalisation route mapped out for weaker EU economies such as Portugal and Greece which allow state-controlled monopoly operators until 2003 to adjust to the open market. The development opens the door to large telecommunications investment in Spain - in the short term large sums are likely to be routed towards the cable television business - but it is also a political indicator of the government's ambitions to catch up with the core of Europe and, in so doing, to decouple from the EU's poorer peripheral members. The measures, which were announced after a Friday cabinet meeting, are nevertheless weighted towards a continued dominance of Telefonica in the domestic market and they also favour Spanish telecommunications companies. Telefonica, which is 32 per cent government-owned, will have one of the two future cable television licences in order to protect its telephone business. This reflects an earlier ruling which reserves one of the two new mobile telephone licences to be awarded later this year for the monopoly operator and invites the private sector to bid for the second licence. A main plank of the deregulation initiative is to assist the development of domestic telecommunications groups. The government therefore said it would favour a primarily Spanish consortium as the second basic telephony operator in 1998. In addition, the authority which will regulate the future cable and local television networks and oversee the deregulation process is to be a department of the transport and telecommunications ministry whose present incumbent, Mr Jose Borrell, has long been viewed as a determined protector of Telefonica's monopoly privileges.</p>

			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / International Company News: French state bank may lift Spanish presence CREDIT Lyonnais, the French state-controlled bank, is on the brink of nearly doubling its presence in Spain by taking control of Banco Jover, a unit of Spain's Banco Santander. The French bank has carried out an ambitious programme of acquisitions in Europe, including the purchase less than a year ago of Banco Comercial Espanol (BCE), which is another subsidiary of Santander. Mr Jean-Yves Haberer, Credit Lyonnais's chairman, said that Banco Jover, with 98 branches and 750 employees, would strengthen his group's presence in Catalonia, especially. Overall, it would now rank as the sixteenth largest bank in Spain with a market share of 1.5 per cent. Mr Haberer, who has set about acquiring significant all-round banking operations in all significant European markets, said that Credit Lyonnais had now reached an adequate size in Spain, Portugal, Italy, the Netherlands and Belgium. In the UK, he said, it ranked as the largest continental European bank, while its entry into Germany involves a long-discussed but much-delayed share exchange with Commerzbank. French bankers said, however, that Credit Lyonnais appeared to be looking for further acquisitions in Italy, where it recently took the majority of Credito Bergamasco. No price was disclosed for the acquisition of Banco Jover, and estimates have ranged as high as FFr3.3bn (Dollars 559.3m), this figure would represent more than 13 times 1990 earnings. Cariplo, the Italian banking group, had originally taken a stake in Banco Jover, but decided that it was not worth spending the additional money required to take control, even at a much lower price than the price that had been paid by Credit Lyonnais.</p>

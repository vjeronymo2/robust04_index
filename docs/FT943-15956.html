			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / Brussels clears first of three airline aid cases A big injection of government capital into TAP-Air Portugal, the state-owned carrier, will not contravene European rules on state aid provided the airline restructures itself, the European Commission ruled yesterday. The decision has cleared the way for the beleaguered Portuguese airline to benefit from up to Es180bn (Pounds 711m) in borrowing guarantees and tax exemption which will finance a 'genuine' restructuring of the company. Yesterday's news comes as a foretaste of the much more controversial decision on state aid to Air France to be taken at the end of this month. The French case will be more closely examined by competitors who argue that government assistance to the French carrier discriminates against them. Many in the Commission believe that the end of July deadline for the decision on Air France is too ambitious. Brussels will be exceptionally cautious in what it demands of the French for fear that competitors, such as British Airways, will take the case to the European Court once a decision has been made. The decision on TAP also raises the prospect that the Commission will find in favour of Greek government aid to Olympic Airlines, in another impending state-aid case. The Greek aid package amounts to Ecu2bn (Pounds 1.54bn), to be split into two parts, with Ecu1.1bn absorbing Olympic's previous debts and Ecu9m earmarked for future capital projects. The conditions attached to the decision on TAP stipulate that the tax exemption in favour of the airline be abolished by the end of the restructuring period; TAP will also not be allowed to increase its European market share; and the Portuguese government will have to submit an annual report on the restructuring to Brussels four weeks before the date of the aid payments. Furthermore, TAP will not be allowed to acquire additional shareholdings in other carriers and no more aid can now be granted. This last condition is understood to have been insisted on by commissioners Sir Leon Brittan and Mr Karel Van Miert. Portugal told the Commission earlier this year of its plans to increase TAP's capital. It said it intended to take over part of the company's debts and guarantee loans made to the airline, as part of an overall package to reduce its workforce and cut most of its transatlantic routes. The Commission added yesterday that aid used to plug the deficits run up by TAP in flying to the islands of the Azores and Madeira were compatible with European rules. The remoteness of the islands meant the government had to find some way of meeting its public service obligations.</p>

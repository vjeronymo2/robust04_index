			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / Bank forecasts low G7 growth ECONOMIC developments among Britain's leading trading partners offer 'little encouragement' to UK policy makers, the Bank of England says. It points out that growth in the US, Japan, Germany, France, Italy and Canada is likely to average only 1 per cent this year. While the Bank's quarterly bulletin sees little prospect of recovery stalling in the US, it warns that there are few signs of an upturn in Germany or Japan.</p>

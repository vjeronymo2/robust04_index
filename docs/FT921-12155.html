			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / Fears grow of German steel strike GLOOM gathered over the Ger-man steel industry yesterday as unions said that workers were voting heavily in favour of a strike, in spite of further warnings of job losses. The IG Metall union said yesterday that the ballot, which began on Sunday and runs until Friday, had so far produced a 90 per cent 'yes' vote for strike action. Its figures were based on unofficial estimates by local union officials. The voters' motives were mixed. While some claimed the employers would now have to pay dearly for their refusal to offer more than a 5.5 per cent pay rise, others said they were prepared for action only because they were unwilling to 'let the union down'. Voting coincided with a report from the RWI economic research institute in Essen which forecast stagnant steel output this year and the loss of 6,000 jobs from the industry's 135,000 workforce in western Germany. The DAG white collar union, meanwhile, voted to hold a strike ballot this week among banking workers who have claimed a 10.5 per cent pay increase and been offered 4.5 per cent. IG Bau, the 1m-strong construction industry union, is expected to announce a 9.5 per cent claim tomorrow. Trade union solidarity is emerging as the main issue in the 1992 pay round. With claims averaging 9.5 per cent and government, employers and the Bundesbank united in resisting any advances beyond 6 per cent, tension is increasingly rapidly. Implicit support for resistance to union demands from the meeting of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations in New York at the weekend brought protests yesterday from the DGB trade union federation. Mr Michael Geuenich, a DGB board member, said internal wage negotiations were a matter for unions and employers and had no place in international discussions. Results of the steel ballot are expected on Saturday when, provided a 75 per cent majority votes in favour of action, the IG Metall board is expected to announce the first stoppages. An immediate all-out strike is unlikely, and tactical stoppages are expected as the union attempts to extract an improved offer from employers. Meanwhile the rise in west German inflation appeared to slow down in January according to provisional figures from several states. The state of Hesse yesterday reported a 0.4 per cent increase over December ' largely due to higher rents ' which translated into a 4.1 per cent year-on-year rise. This compares with a figure of 3.8 per cent in Baden-Wurttemberg and 3.9 per cent in North Rhine Westphalia, home state to the bulk of the country's steel industry.</p>

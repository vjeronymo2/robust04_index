			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Tax officer's misconduct The combined total of my retirement and occupational pensions are below the amount necessary to absorb my personal allowance. I am, therefore, entitled to a refund of tax on my investment income. Due to an admitted oversight in the local tax office, I did not receive a refund for 1992/93 until January this year. In the Revenue's letter of apology, it was written: 'I have arranged for a tax return to be issued to you shortly after Easter this year. 'When completed, you should forward your dividend vouchers with the return so that any refund due to you for the current year can be settled quickly and avoid the problems that have arisen to date.' My return was duly received just after Easter and submitted - together with a claim for repayment of tax, my dividend counterfoils and March pay slip - on April 11. But I was advised by the county council, my previous employer, that it would not be issuing P60 forms until mid-May, although I am not aware of any information on the P60 which was not on the March pay slip. I am now told by the Revenue that it is their practice to accept form P60 and that no repayment of tax can be made to me until the form is received. Is there any statutory authority by which the Revenue is entitled to withhold repayment of tax, or is it simply an arbitrary decision? No, the tax officer who refused to process your claim in April acted unlawfully and will doubtless be severely reprimanded by the district inspector. Write a formal letter of complaint to the district inspector (whose name should be printed on the letterhead of the tax office), marking both your letter and the envelope 'For the attention of the district inspector.' As you have been the victim of maladministration for two consecutive years, the inspector undoubtedly will add at least Pounds 100 to your delayed 1993-94 refund by way of token compensation for the persistent misconduct of his staff. At the same time, you could ask the inspector for a copy of the free leaflet IR 120 (You and the Inland Revenue), and also ask him to arrange for you to receive refunds by instalments during 1994-95 and future years so that you do not have to wait until after the end of each tax year before you get any money back. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

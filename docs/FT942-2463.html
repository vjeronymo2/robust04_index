			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / Nordic parties to decide on EU A big step forward in persuading the people of Finland, Norway and Sweden to support membership of the European Union should be taken this weekend when three key political parties hold special conferences to decide official policy on the issue. The Centre party of Prime Minister Esko Aho in Finland, Mrs Gro Harlem Brundtland's ruling Labour party in Norway and the powerful Swedish Social Democratic party will all make a formal decision on whether to back membership in their respective referendums to be held in October and November. All three parties harbour strong anti-EU factions, but in each case the pro-membership stance of the party leaderships is expected to prevail, allowing the leaders to throw their party machines behind the Yes campaign. The sharpest debate is likely in Finland, where Mr Aho has tied his future as party leader and the future of his coalition to a Yes decision. Mr Aho was unsettled earlier this week when a number of his MPs abstained in a failed parliamentary vote of no-confidence because of their objection to his pro-EU policy. But he has produced a FM4bn (Pounds 480m) package of aid to help farmers over the adjustment to EU prices and should win the showdown vote today. Mrs Brundtland and Mr Ingvar Carlsson, leader of the Swedish Social Democrats, are meanwhile confident of a safe pro-EU majority in their respective party meetings. Last Sunday's decisive vote in favour of EU membership in fellow applicant Austria has given the Yes camp in the Nordic countries a boost. A poll this week in Finland, which will vote next on October 16, put support for the EU at 47 per cent, with 32 per cent against and 21 per cent undecided. But the No side remains firmly in the lead in Sweden, which votes on November 13, and in Norway, which votes on November 28.</p>

			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / Bayer in Dollars 200m drive to expand Chinese presence Bayer, the German chemicals and pharmaceuticals group, is to invest Dollars 200m (Pounds 134m) in six Chinese enterprises as part of a drive to establish a comprehensive presence in China. An umbrella agreement was signed at the weekend in Beijing with the Chinese Ministry of Chemical Industry and subsidiary agreements with prospective partners. Ventures include plastics manufacturing, the production of tanning agents and dyes, and the packaging of photographic film. Mr Dieter Becher, a Bayer board member responsible for Asia, announced the establishment of a holding company in Beijing to oversee Bayer's business in China, one of the first such foreign holding companies on the mainland. Mr Becher said: 'Bringing our best technologies here is the best way a company like Bayer can contribute to the development of an advanced chemical industry in this country.' Bayer's announcement follows a visit to China earlier this month by Chancellor Helmut Kohl aimed at boosting the German business presence. Agreements signed during the Kohl visit totalled more than Dollars 2bn and included the sale of six Airbus A340's and a contract for the construction of an 18-kilometre underground link in Guangzhou. Bayer's decision to establish a presence in China also reflects growing competition among chemicals and pharmaceutical companies for a share of a booming market. Mr Becher said Bayer's exports to China totalled DM520m (Pounds 206m) in 1992, but 'it would be difficult to increase this on the basis of imports alone'. Bayer's umbrella agreement with the Chemical Industry Ministry covers co-operation in planning and construction of chemical plant, and in engineering and technology transfer. The German company will also manufacture Baygon, its well-known insecticide, under licence with the Huabao Group in Guangdong province. Marketing starts next year. Projects under consideration include production of pharmaceuticals, and animal health and crop protection products.</p>

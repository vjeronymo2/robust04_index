			<p>BFN     [Text] In Cabo Delgado today President of the Republic  Joaquim Chissano inaugurated the graphite plant in Ancuabe  District, 100 km from the provincial capital, Pemba. Our  reporter Remigio Membe reports from the area:    There are now two factories for processing mining products.  The marble factory was inaugurated in 1993 by the head of  state. The graphite plant belongs to a South African  businessman, and the study for locating the minerals was carried  out by a Bulgarian company which specializes in mining  exploration.    The president of the Republic, who began his visit to Cabo  Delgado yesterday, addressed a mass rally in the Chiure District  capital after concluding his visit to Nampula Province. In  Chiure Chissano said he is visiting the countryside to acquaint  himself with the people's problems and to reassure them that the  war is over in Mozambique.    He urged the population to end hatred and concentrate on  national reconstruction. Answering a question from the head of  state, the Chiure residents said that the economy and social  infrastructures were destroyed by the Mozambique National  Resistance [Renamo], adding that all citizens and the government  need to be involved in national reconstruction.    President Chissano also appealed to the Chiure residents to  prepare to vote in October for the candidate which they believe  promises a better future for Mozambique. He said the elections  must be fair and democratic.    Before leaving Chiure District, Chissano visited the local  health center, noting the shortages of beds, mattresses, an  ambulance, as well as technical and medical personnel.    Besides inaugurating the graphite plant, the president of  the  Republic might currently be addressing a mass rally in the same  area. At about 1630 today the Mozambican head of state is  scheduled to be in Pemba, after an hour and a half journey from  Ancuabe.</p>

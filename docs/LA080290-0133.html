			<p><P> August 2, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> L.B. COUNCIL REFUSES TO PUT ETHICS PACKAGE ON BALLOT  </P> <P> The City Council this week rejected a ballot proposal to create a local ethics  commission to investigate allegations of improprieties against elected  officials and other city employees.  </P> <P> The measure would also have established public funding for political campaigns  and given the five-member ethics panel the power to raise the pay of local  officials.  </P> <P> In a heated meeting Tuesday that was marked by confusion and sideline  negotiations, the council voted against sending the proposal to the voters in  November. Council members, meeting as the Charter Amendment Committee, voted 7  to 2 to refer the ethics package to the council's Legislative Committee for  further work.  </P> <P> "In effect, that killed it," said Councilman Evan Anderson Braude, who  supported the proposal. "The deadline to get it on the November ballot is Aug.  10."  </P> <P> Braude said after the council meeting: "Obviously, I'm disappointed. When will  we deal with the concerns of our citizens about campaign reform?"  </P> <P> Activist Bob Roxby chided the council, urging members to "stop acting like a  bunch of politicians trying to keep your jobs."  </P> <P> Roxby said residents are "mad enough" to approve a ballot initiative on the  issue.  </P> <P> But Councilman Les Robbins echoed the concerns of opponents when he said,  "We're sitting here with a proposal that no one knows how much it will cost."  </P> <P> City officials estimated that the proposal would cost the city about $500,000  annually. But Robbins and others predicted that outside attorneys would have to  be hired -- at $150 an hour -- raising the costs significantly.  </P> <P> Councilman Warren Harwood said: "A tax-poor community that can't afford to put  cops on the street can't afford this. We're not anti-ethics. We're practical  people who have to deal with the problems of this city."  </P> <P> Harwood also described the proposal as a back-door attempt to give the council  a pay raise. Last June, voters rejected a proposal to double salaries for the  part-time council to about $35,000 a year.  </P> <P> Opponents also questioned whether the measure's public-financing provision  could withstand a court challenge.  </P> <P> On the same day that the council debated the issue, Los Angeles City Councilman  Ernani Bernardi and others sued to block implementation of the finance  provisions of a recently adopted ethics package in Los Angeles. They argued  that public financing of campaigns is prohibited under 1988's Proposition 73  campaign measure.  </P> <P> The Long Beach measure rejected Tuesday was partly modeled after Proposition H,  the ethics package that Los Angeles voters approved in June.  </P> <P> The Long Beach ethics package would have created an ethics committee with  subpoena powers and the authority to enforce conflict-of-interest and campaign  regulations. It would also have limited individual contributions to $750 per  candidate during each election and allowed for public campaign funding,  although it did not specify amounts.  </P> <P> The measure's fate seemed unsure throughout most of the meeting, where it  became apparent that council members Braude, Wallace Edgerton, Tom Clark and  Clarence Smith supported it, while council members Harwood, Robbins, Doug  Drummond and Jeff Kellogg opposed it.  </P> <P> Councilman Ray Grabinski held the key swing vote. During a series of straw  polls, which are rare during council meetings, Grabinski indicated that he  supported the measure. But as the meeting continued and it became clear that  his vote was not firm, council members continually left their seats to argue  among themselves, sometimes angrily.  </P> <P> After one five-minute recess, Braude suggested delaying action for a week to  discuss the measure with the city's unions, because the proposal would affect  all employees.  </P> <P> Edgerton objected, saying: "I will not be here on Monday. . . . We're playing  games. Everybody knows where they're coming from."  </P> <P> Grabinski, telling why he finally decided to oppose the measure, told his  colleagues: "I didn't think it was a great idea for us to snap because Los  Angeles has or presumes it has (an ethics) problem."  </P> <P> During the meeting, Mayor Ernie Kell also suggested that his veto power be  strengthened as part of the ethics package. Several council members said that  Kell had been lobbying for stronger veto power.  </P> <P> "Everybody had an agenda," Robbins said Wednesday. "Evan wanted his ethics  commission. Tom wanted his public financing. Wally wanted a pay raise, and  Ernie wanted a veto."  </P></p>

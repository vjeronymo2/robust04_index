			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / Enlargement of EU strains Franco-German axis: Anxiety in Paris over the future of the Union has led to criticism of 'heavy-handed' tactics by Bonn The close diplomatic and political ties between Paris and Bonn, traditionally regarded as the principal motor of European integration, have come under new strain because of French concerns at the whole process of enlargement of the European Union, according to senior government officials. Criticism of Germany's allegedly heavy-handed tactics in forcing the pace of the enlargement negotiations in Brussels emerged in Bonn yesterday, causing anger and alarm in the office of Chancellor Helmut Kohl. 'We are urgently trying to contain the damage,' one German official said yesterday. The French concerns over EU enlargement include a worry about the inclusion of a strong free trade lobby with the new northern members, and fear that community institutions will be made both weaker and more cumbersome with rapid enlargement to eastern Europe. Publication of a long and detailed critique of German foreign policy in the prestigious Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, quoting French sources in the German capital, has clearly come at an acutely embarrassing time for the German chancellor, who has just launched a highly personalised campaign for re-election. Mr Kohl is basing his appeal to German voters, both in the forthcoming European elections, and in the general election in October, on his record as a staunch proponent of European integration, and the guarantor of good relations with major powers like France, Britain, the US and Russia. Any suggestion that his closest ally, France, is dissatisfied with the relationship is seen by senior German officials as extremely unhelpful. The article is the latest in a series of diplomatic upsets, including uncertainty over whether the German leader should be invited to the 50th anniversary celebrations of the D-Day landings in Normandy, and cancellation of the Allied military parades planned to mark withdrawal of British, French and American forces from Berlin. According to well-placed officials, the article was based on an interview with Mr Francois Scheer, the French ambassador in Bonn, by Mr Claus Gennrich, the respected diplomatic correspondent of the German newspaper. In it, he suggests that the Normandy and Berlin incidents were only minor upsets, but should be seen against the background of a general mistrust of German foreign policy in Paris. 'A more fundamental dialogue is needed to create greater clarity between Bonn and Paris over the definition of foreign policy in a united Germany, but it is not taking place,' the newspaper said, citing the French sources. The Frankfurter Allgemeine said the French were calling for German clarity on its attitude towards eastern Europe, and the move of the seat of government from Bonn to Berlin. They were seeking a 'clear restatement' of Germany's commitment to western Europe, particularly if Bonn wished to reinforce its relations with Russia. The French officials are said to be worried by German statements from Mr Klaus Kinkel, the foreign minister, suggesting that enlargement will 'shift the balance' of the Community. David Buchan adds from Paris: Mr Jean-Marie Girault, the mayor of Caen in Normandy, yesterday weighed into the delicate diplomatic dilemma over possible German presence at this summer's commemoration of the D-Day landings by saying he hoped Mr Kohl would attend 'a peace ceremony' in his city. The Caen mayor, who is also a French senator, said he would invite the German chancellor to a peace ceremony near the Caen war memorial on June 6. 'It is not easy to imagine Helmut Kohl on Omaha Beach where 3,000 American soldiers died,' he said, 'but the ceremony on the evening of June 6 will try to transcend military events and be an event for peace and reconciliation among peoples,' Mr Girault said. The French government has so far held back from inviting Mr Kohl to any part of the 50th anniversary of the D-Day landings,but an opinion poll this week showed that 57 per cent of French believed that Germany should be presented at the Normandy celebrations.</p>

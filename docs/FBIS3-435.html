			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by Interior and National Security Minister </F> Jean-Claude Dobanga Boti in Bangui on 6 March--recorded]    [Text] Ladies and gentlemen, dear fellow citizens. The  Central African Republic has installed political democracy. It  has become a state where there is the rule of law. Since his  investiture, the elected president of the Republic has always  preached dialogue with all the social and political groups of  the nation. He has made social justice and dialogue the  watchwords of his national policy. Unfortunately, this political  will for reconciliation and national reconstruction is not  accepted by a good number of Central Africans.    As the minister of interior and national security, and to  support the head of state's policy, I have continued to receive  in my office some lost sons of the country who deliberately take  pleasure in acts of social agitation and socio-political  upheavals. Despite my appeals for order and national unity, I  have observed and recorded facts of partisan dissentions and  disorders, marked by (?obscene) and irresponsible demonstrations  organized by small groups still pining for an era fresh in the  minds; an ear which supported the very people who caused its  fall [words indistinct] arms. Some people have organized  hotbeds in some areas in the capital with the sole aim of  disturbing public peace and disrupting the smooth running of our  democratic and republican institutions. These hotbeds are  marked by acts of aggression against strangers and French  technical assistants. These are innocent targets who are faced  with armed attacks in their homes.    All these purely barbaric acts only aim at destabilizing the  democratically elected and recently installed government.  Considering the manifest dishonesty insincerity of these [word  indistinct] agitators (?sponsored and trained) by [words  indistinct] which mistake democracy with anarchy, I make it my  duty, as the minister in charge of our country's internal  security and guarantor of public order and (?peace), to make a  public appeal to the national and international community. I  appeal to the organizations for the defense of human rights to  witness this situation. I cannot continue to tolerate such acts  of political agitation, social upheavals, and public disorder in  a state where there is the rule of law.    As the minister of interior and national security, I have  the  duty to install state authority in order to guarantee the  regalia of a democratic state. So, beginning with this warning,  I am giving firm instructions to the competent police to ask  them to ensure, in the implementation of the country's laws,  that all the (?enemies) of democracy are exposed. Thank you.</p>

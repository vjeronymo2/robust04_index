			<p>Language: <F P=105> Cambodian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The puppets of the Vietnamese communists gathered  their troops from here and there, along with the troops left  over along National Route 6 in Siem Reap Province, and deployed  them at Spean Koul Village, Krapoe Commune on the border of  Stoung District in Kompong Thom Province and Chikreng District  in Siem Reap Province from 15 to 18 January.    The attacking troops of the Vietnamese communists' puppets  started their drive against the people and Democratic Kampuchea  on 19 January. However, the people -- who are boiling with rage  against the Vietnamese communists and have been robbed and  ruined by these bandits -- joined the National Army of  Democratic Kampuchea [NADK] and closely collaborated with the  latter in the counterattackg to protect the people's property  and lives.    At that time, a number of soldiers of the Vietnamese  communists' puppets and of the Paras [troops of the Khmer  People's National Liberation Front] -- who have deserted to live  with their parents and due to their anger, lack of money, and  hunger because their salary was robbed from them by their  superiors -- joined the NADK and the people and chased away and  swept the attacking troops of Vietnam's puppets along Route 6 in  Siem Reap Province.    One part of the force chased the attacking troops from Spean  Koul to Pralay and Stoung. Another part of the force swept the  enemy from Spean Koul, Lveng Russei, to Kompong Kdei. The  attacking troops of the Vietnamese communists' puppets were  routed; many were killed or wounded by mines, booby traps, and  other [words indistinct].    This is a counter attack to protect the property and lives  of  the people, who have been constant victims of the enemy's  plunder, burning, and oppression for the past more than 15  years. This clearly shows that the Cambodian nation and people  will not let troops of the Vietnamese communists' puppets do  what they want at will. People have to fight to defend their  villages, property, and lives. They want peace and national  reconciliation instead of fighting for the Vietnamese communists  and Western powers.    If these soldiers' leaders want to remain servants of the  Vietnamese communists and the Western powers in order to have  rank, honors, and money, let them fight themselves.</p>

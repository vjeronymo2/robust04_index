			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Address by Chan Youran, leader of the Democratic Kampuchea </F> [DK] delegation at the roundtable meeting in Phnom Penh on 15  June -- read by announcer]    [Text] With respect to the samdech [title of Nhoek  Chulong, Sihanouk's representative at the meeting] royal  representative:    I. Our Democratic Kampuchea delegation attends this meeting  of the roundtable commission -- which was born of the roundtable  meeting under the lofty chairmanship of His Majesty [H.M.] King  Norodom Sihanouk in Pyongyang on 27 May -- with a profound will  to continue the process and efforts to achieve national  reconciliation, national union, and genuine peace in Cambodia.    The roundtable is the inspiration of the king, who initiated  this with a resolute desire to see the Cambodian motherland  achieve national reconciliation, national union, and permanent  peace so that all his children can live and earn a living  normally.    II. The Party of Democratic Kampuchea [PDK] fully assists  and supports the king's astute initiative because national  reconciliation and national concord to unite all national forces  and genuine and permanent peace in Cambodia are the sacred and  profound aspirations of our entire nation and people at home and  abroad. The Cambodian nation and people [words indistinct] do  not need war. The war of more than a decade has made our nation  and people go through great suffering and destruction.  Therefore, whatever is making the war continue does not  correspond to the interests of our nation and people. All kinds  of problems, national and social, which are already serious,  will worsen. War brings outside interference and allows  foreigners an opportunity to split the nation and fuel the war  even more. These are great dangers directly affecting the  suvival of our Cambodian nation, people, and race.    As the king has reminded us, war will lead Cambodia to  death,  peace and national reconciliation will lead us to national  survival. The king has shown that the way to save the nation and  prevent it from extinction has only one magic formula: national  reconciliation and union. As long as there are meetings and  discussions, gradual results, be they small or large, will be  achieved.    The samdech royal representative:    III. Our PDK delegation is happy with this meeting of the  roundtable commission. We agree with the two items on the  agenda set up by H.M. King Norodom Sihanouk on 5 June. These  are:    1. Discussion of the unconditional, immediate, and permanent  cease-fire throughout the country;    2. Discussion of the minimal policy program for national  reconciliation and peace.    The two items are due for discussion at this meeting and at  subsequent meetings of our roundtable commission because they  are topical issues that have to be discussed.    IV. Concerning the item on the cease-fire, H.M. King Norodom  Sihanouk has asked for a yes or no reply. Therefore, we would  like to express our view on this matter in accordance with the  king's question.    We, the PDK, are happy to have a cease-fire. We are happy  for a cease-fire, now, we have been in the past, and we will be  in the future because the PDK, like the rest of the nation and  people, has been the victim. The PDK does not want to wage war  and fight. The Cambodian nation and people do not want fighting  and war. We want the war to end quickly and we want to achieve  national reconciliation and peace quickly. We hold that it is  necessary to establish a genuine and permanent cease-fire  throughout the nation with proper and adequate control over the  commission or technical group to be set up for this purpose.    V. On the minimal policy program, our view is that to  achieve national reconciliation in accordance with the profound  will and aspiration of our nation and people, all parties ought  to compromise and make mutual concessions. We hold that to  achieve national reconciliation and national union, all of us  ought to have an acceptable basis on which to work together. On  this basis, we will discuss together what the PDK should give to  the two-prime ministers government and what the latter should  give to the PDK.    The samdech royal representative:    VI. We hold that in the past, now, and in the future, all of  us should put national reconciliation and national concord above  everything else and strive to meet to discuss and gradually  achieve results until we reach full achievement.    In this spirit, we would like to propose that our roundtable  commission meet once or twice a month from now on.    Finally, we wish for good results from the meeting of our  roundtable commission, chaired by the samdech royal  representative, to move toward achieving national reconciliation  and to rally all Cambodian national forces so that Cambodia has  peace and that every Cambodian can live and earn a living  peacefully forever.</p>

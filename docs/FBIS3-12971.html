The newspaper AL-MUSTAQBAL, mouthpiece of the Yemeni  Socialist Party, today reported that the committee, which also  includes Jordanian and Omani military officers, had to leave  al-Bayda' Governorate without ending the tension there.    The troops, which the committee failed to return to their  original positions, were brought into al-Bayda' Governorate from  various Yemeni towns following the military friction that has  been going on since 20 February between southern units loyal to  the Yemeni Socialist Party and northern units. They include the  56th Armored Brigade and two other brigades, as well as units  from the Central Security Forces and a Republican Guard  battalion.    The paper notes that the military committee's failure in  al-Bayda' Governorate heralds other failures in other areas.</p>

			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: Tighter tax rules for immigrants - A look at the implications for would-be settlers, and those in the UK already Changes to UK immigration rules, announced earlier this year, are implemented today and will have a significant effect on those wanting to move to the UK. When the changes (see box at right) were announced, the government was accused by some critics of 'selling the right to live here'. Its response was to claim it was simply encouraging investment. But one side-effect of the changes has become apparent already - the significant tax consequences for many of the people the government says it is trying to attract. As well as affecting those planning to come to the UK, the changes could affect those already in the country. Many people have to renew their residence visas from time to time. And where the renewal is treated as a new application, the approach taken by the immigration authorities could change. The best way to demonstrate the practical effect of the changes is by way of example: Hassan, a man of independent means Imagine a successful businessman from the Middle East, Hassan, who has interests in various countries. Having built up his business over a period of 30 years, he decides at age-51 that he wants to retire early and move to the UK with his wife and young family. In the past, he would have applied to go to the UK as a man of independent means. He would have had to show that he had some connection there - perhaps a house, or regular holidays and business connections - together with assets of more than Pounds 200,000. In all probability, he would have been given the right to live there on condition he did not work. From today, that is no longer the case - because of his age. Only people over 60 will be able to go to the UK under the new independent means rules. One of the advantages of the independent means rules was that there was no obligation to take any fixed amount to the UK. Had Hassan made the application before today, he could have organised his tax and financial affairs to ensure he kept his UK tax to a absolute minimum - perhaps even to zero. Hassan, the investor Since he is too young to move to the UK as a man of independent means, Hassan might investigate the possibility of going as an 'investor'. If he can show that he has Pounds 1m, and is prepared to invest Pounds 750,000 of it in government bonds or shares, he should be all right. Suddenly, though, Hassan finds he needs two sets of advice - first, on how to make the immigration application and, second, on the tax consequences of the promises he is making. For instance: He will have to be careful about how he takes his money into the UK - it is possible the Inland Revenue could treat him as being resident because of past visits. It would be unfortunate if he was taxed because of this. Once the money is in the UK, he will have to invest it. The income from this will be taxed in the same way it would be for anyone else. He will need to submit tax returns (although, as a man of independent means, he could avoid this if he arranged his affairs carefully). The tax authorities will want to see if the income from his UK investments is enough to support Hassan and his family in the style to which they have become accustomed. If the Revenue is not convinced that the investment income is enough for this purpose, and Hassan continues with an up-market life-style, he might need to prove where he is getting the extra resources to do so. But with care, and by following the rules, he should pay tax only on UK-generated income. What is clear is that Hassan's life in the UK is going to be rather more complicated than it would have been as a man of independent means. The Revenue will be in contact with him or his accountants every year when his tax return is completed. The new rules are not good for Hassan, and he will have to decide if he wants to wait until he reaches 60 before applying to go to the UK as a man of independent means, or accept the restrictions that will be imposed upon him as an investor. Omar, a sole representative Having been successful in his business abroad, Omar might be asked by his company to be its sole representative in the UK. Under the old immigration rules, he would have had to pay tax on his salary like anyone else, but the company would have been outside the UK tax net. From today, Omar's company must register a branch or subsidiary if he is to be its representative. It will then have a UK tax profile - which it might not want. Hassan, the businessman Hassan might decide he does not wish to be a man of independent means and wants to carry on working. So, he could consider setting up a business in the UK. The rules about this have not changed significantly; the minimum amount of money required to be invested in a business remains only Pounds 200,000, which must be held in the name of the person moving to the UK rather than, say, in trust or in another company. The disadvantage for Hassan is that, if he dies prematurely, it will be taxed under UK inheritance tax rules. The subtle changes to the immigration rules undoubtedly will make the arrangements for would-be immigrants more complicated. Never before has immigration and tax planning become so inter-linked. Still, with careful planning, the many tax advantages available to people from abroad will remain.

			<p>930104 FT  04 JAN 93 / Foreign Exchange and Money Markets: Watching the franc FOREIGN EXCHANGE and money market dealing will pick up today after the Christmas and New Year break, and many dealers are wondering whether the much-heralded speculative attack on the Irish punt and French franc will take place, writes James Blitz. The pressure on both currencies comes mainly from the D-Mark's high short-term interest rates. Compounding this are fears that both currencies must be devalued if French and Irish exporters are not to lose out from the competitive devaluations last year of sterling, the lira, the peseta and escudo. Political difficulties in both Paris and Dublin add to the pressures. However, over the Christmas period, the slide of both currencies inside the Exchange Rate Mechanism was checked, because of renewed expectations that the Bundesbank might cut interest rates soon. The franc has spent much of the last 10 days above the FFr3.40 level against the D-Mark. Cash rates in the Irish punt market dropped down to around 14 per cent on New Year's eve, although the currency remained near the bottom of its ERM band against the Belgian franc. The market's main focus this week will therefore be on the Bundesbank's weekly securities repurchase tender on Wednesday, and the council meeting the following day. Miss Alison Cottrell, an economist at Midland Global Markets in London, believes that any expectations of an easing in money market or official rates this week are sure to be dashed. German call money ended the year well above the 8.75 percent repo rate, making an easing unlikely there. She also believes that the Bundesbank will await the outcome of the German public sector wage talks in which public sector employers will aim to keep wage rises to between 3.0 and 3.25 per cent. Miss Cottrell believes that the Bundesbank meeting of February 18th is the one to watch.</p>

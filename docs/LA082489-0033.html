			<p><P> August 24, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. AMATEUR GOLF CHAMPIONSHIP;  </P> <P> O'CONNELL IS MEDALIST BY ONE STROKE  </P> <P> Irishman Eoghan O'Connell shot a one-under-par 69 Wednesday to lead a field of  64 qualifiers into four days of match play for the U.S. Amateur Golf  Championship.  </P> <P> The 21-year-old senior at Wake Forest won medal honors for the 36-hole  qualifying with a 68-69 -- 137, four under par, edging Phil Mickelson, the 1989  National Collegiate Athletic Assn. champion from Arizona State and San Diego,  who shot 70-68 -- 138.  </P> <P> Three were tied at 142: John (Tripp) Isenhour (69-73), a Georgia Tech junior;  Jim Pemberton (73-69), a sophomore at USC, and Chris Patton (71-71), a junior  from Clemson.  </P> <P> Doug Martin of Van Buren, Ohio; John Grace, owner of a real estate company in  Ft. Worth, and Duke Delcher, a former Philadelphia champion, were next at 143.  </P> <P> The 64 survivors from a field of 312 start match play today with 18 holes at  historic Merion Golf Club and continue with 36 holes Friday, Saturday and  Sunday.  </P> <P> The cut came at 149 and a playoff was held to whittle the field to 64.  </P> <P> "It's a lot of prestige," O'Connell said. "There were 312 players here and I  beat 'em all. That should keep me happy for a month."  </P> <P> This was O'Connell's first look of the 6,523-yard Merion course.  </P> <P> "The back nine is superb," he said. "Sixteen, 17 and 18 are as good a finish as  you'll get. It's not a very long course, but it has character."  </P></p>

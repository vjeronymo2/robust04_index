			<p><P> November 27, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> ONE MORE TIME: Encouraged by the overwhelming "yes" vote in Laguna Niguel,  backers of cityhood for Laguna Hills are about to try again. . . . Their first  attempt on the June ballot failed by less than 1% because of a strong no vote  from Leisure World. . . . Backers say they will not include Leisure World in  their next incorporation attempt. . . . Had they done that in June,  incorporation would have passed by more than 8 to 1.

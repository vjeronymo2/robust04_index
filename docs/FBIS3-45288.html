This overseas-related economic court is the first of its  kind  founded in Sichuan Province.    Along with the expanding of reform and opening, more and  more  economic disputes have surfaced involving foreign-funded  enterprises and Sino-foreign joint ventures as well as investors  from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan.    By the end of last year, the city had 1,300 overseas-funded  businesses.    Early in 1977, China's first economic court was set up in  Chongqing. The Sichuan intermediate court began to prepare for  the foundation of an economic court to handle disputes involving  overseas clients April last year.    During the preparatory period, the court took up 19 economic  cases, involving 37 million yuan and 2.3 million U.S. dollars.</p>

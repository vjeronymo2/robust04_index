Mayor Huang Ju met little opposition when  he informed Beijing of the decision last week, a senior Shanghai  government official said yesterday on condition of anonymity.    Although the controversial tax was to be levied from January  1 this year, Shanghai will delay implementation until 1995 at  the earliest, the official said. Meanwhile, the city  government, which is counting on receiving ample foreign  property investment for green-field sites in the new Pudong area  and for inner-city redevelopment, will exempt all primary  land-development projects from the tax. "Even if the central  government decides to include these projects, we will give them  a permanent tax holiday," the official said.    The news will come as a blow to the State Taxation  Administration in Beijing, which has asserted all along that the  tax must be levied this year in line with the State Council's  edict last month. Beijing's grip on the matter is expected to  fall apart in the next few weeks as other cities and provinces  announce their own delays and exemptions.    Hong Kong businessmen have voiced strong concern about the  tax, saying it would scare away property investments. Some have  made plans to lobby officials in Beijing and current projects  are believed to be on hold.</p>

			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / Arts: American influences - Concerts in London The billing for Wednesday's concert by Music Projects/London was 'American Counterpoints', but this really applied only to Steve Reich's ingenious Vermont Counterpoint for one live flute and ten more on tape; and maybe, to Colin Matthews' Hidden Variables, which is in part a mischievous send-up (British) of American minimalism and post-minimalism. Still, what's in a name? In this case, the official but purely notional tie-in with the American Art show at the Royal Academy. (There may have been people there who came expressly to match their impressions of American abstract painting against aural Reich and John Cage, but how would one know?) Forget the label: this was a concert full of lively imagination, from the planning to the execution - bright, inquiring, funny and exhilarating. Music Projects/London was set up by the conductor Richard Bernas a good while ago. Their distinguished seniors, the London Sinfonietta, have enjoyed more continuity of personnel; but the MP/L's track record must by now make them the leading young challengers. In the Queen Elizabeth Hall on Wednesday, it seemed to me - I may be wrong - that there were many more under-25s than the norm for the pricier Sinfonietta concerts. Yet that was not because the MP/L programme was hot-off-the-stove stuff. On the contrary, it treated us to ancient, scatty Charles Ives, and John Cage in his least-known period (a 1947 ballet score for Merce Cunningham, The Seasons), along with the more recent Reich and Matthews. The ten minutes of Reich's fresh, extremely clever multi-flute exercise were entirely justified by Nancy Ruffer's solo playing. The Cage score finds him somewhere between tranquil, mock-naive formalism and an active urge to scrap Western musical paraphernalia altogether: fascinatingly dull, not just dull. MP/L is distinguished above all for its cutting edge and its verve. In Ives's three 'Theatre Orchestra Sets' - the fullest versions that I've heard, carefully traced back to the first drafts - everyone in the ensemble leapt to their opportunities, with full prompting from Bernas. Almost every piece in these ragbag collections has a different instrumentation, anything from a woozy wind-band to sighing strings, and each strikes sparks off some unheard-of idea. That cornucopia of random inspirations, whether radical or just gleefully silly, was wonderfully bracing to hear. (Some FT readers might like to know that Ives was all his life a professional insurance man, apparently with great actuarial breakthroughs to his credit.) Matthews' beady-eared diatribe, which features scathing parodies of John Adams in particular and other trendy Americans wholesale, has its own musical sense and weight too, as the ML/P team made clear. We were hearing the new 'chamber' version of Hidden Variables, most obviously in its reduced strings. Aptly tacky, I thought: the budget forces focused the implausibility of what Adams gets away with on Hollywood-scale strings. ***** In the Barbican Hall meanwhile, Itzhak Perlman and the London Symphony Orchestra under Andre Previn were purveying an older, milder brand of American music: Samuel Barber's Violin Concerto of 1940. This expert piece of musical craftsmanship, with its curvaceous Richard-Strauss-goes-to-New-England first movement, gently moody middle and dashing finale, is today more liable to elicit under-praise than encourage over-estimation. It offers no challenge to the listener, no adventure, no threat of uncharted emotional experience; but within their self-ordained limits its musicianly qualities remain effortlessly graceful and delightfully fresh. Perhaps a grander style of musical address, a riper rhetorical character was intended by Barber than Perlman essayed in the solo-writing, or than Previn charged from the orchestral accompaniment; but for shining sweetness and purity of style this violinist has no equals today. This was altogether a fine, civilised performance, and after the interval Previn and the LSO matched it with an Elgar Second Symphony of easy flow and sustainment of symphonic argument. Again, certain Elgarians in the audience might have found their cravings for passionate engagement with the score's melodic shapes unsatisfied (from Elgar's own recording of the work with the LSO we know how high a value he set on full-bodied portamento string-phrasing). But in its truthful, uninflated authority, Previn's command of the symphony is now solidly impressive from first note to last.

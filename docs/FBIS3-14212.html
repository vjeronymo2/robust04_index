The shaykh expressed  surprise and astonishment at the statement, which coincides with  efforts to resume negotiations on the occupied territories,  including Jerusalem.    Shaykh Jad-al-Haqq said: If the American President really  made the statement attributed to him, then this shows that the  American position is not steady. Such statements harm current  efforts to resume talks between the Palestinians and the  Israelis and talks between Israel and the other Arab cordon  states, namely, Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan.    The al-Azhar shaykh called on officials to take a position  if  the U.S. President is proved to have made such a statement.</p>

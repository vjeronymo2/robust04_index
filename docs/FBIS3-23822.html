			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Roundtable discussion with Boris Fedorov, former deputy </F> prime minister and minister of finance of the Russian  Federation, recorded by Grigoriy Tsitrinyak under the rubric  "Club 206," at the LITERATURNAYA GAZETA editorial office; date  not given: "Boris Fedorov: `No More Programs Are Needed--Ever!'"]    [Text] A. Udaltsov, LITERATURNAYA GAZETA editor in  chief. Boris Grigoryevich, my first question is associated  with the current array of political forces. Well, it is  understandable that your opponents criticize you. However, here  is Kozyrev stating that to him, Chernomyrdin is a reformer just  like Gaydar, Popov stating that Gaydar's course was too  pro-Western, Luzhkov stating that the last two "years of Gaydar"  were an economic failure, Shokhin....    B. Fedorov. There already is complete clarity as  far as he is concerned....    A. Udaltsov. So, what is happening?  <H5>  "Red Economic Managers" </H5>   B. Fedorov. Everything is far from unambiguous.  They talk about the "Gaydar government." However, Gaydar was not  a member of the government between 12 December 1992 and 16  September 1993. After 16 September he did not actually take any  action. It is just that for some reason everybody got the  impression that he was prime minister all that time, and that  Chernomyrdin in a way had no part of it. What policy did the  government pursue, and what is reform?    So, if you back 10 ministers against the wall somewhere and  ask them to name at least five points which are characteristic  of the reforms, I assure you that some might not answer at all,  while others will merely repeat "reform! reform! reform!" This  is why I would answer this way: Many of the people who were and  still are members of the government had nothing to do with  either the reforms or the policy pursued.    Aleksandr Nikolayevich Shokhin is the most vivid case in  point. He was a member of Silayev's government in its time, and  later successively deputy chairman for social issues, deputy  chairman for foreign economic relations, and now minister of the  economy; he is fighting to have the Ministry of Foreign Economic  Relations also subordinated to him. The Federal Service on  Hydrometeorology and Environmental Control or the Ministry of  Education may be next up, and I would not be surprised because  he has no clear-cut course, to say nothing about reformism.    I have known Kozyrev for quite a long time: I came to the  Silayev government just before him. My impression is: He  believes that foreign policy can be separated from domestic  policy. I am absolutely convinced that the opposite is true. If  a turnaround begins in the country, considerable changes will  occur in foreign policy, too. Of course, it is possible that he  will turn out to be so flexible as to consider any change normal.    There are a great number of purely functional specialists in  the government--on transportation, etc. Naturally, they also  never had anything to do with the reforms. When Gaydar came in  1991 he began, having secured the support of the president, to  follow, essentially alone, a certain course which turned out to  be short-lived because in the middle of 1992 it became different.    I had only one task: A hard ruble was needed, and there was  no escaping that fact. Financial discipline was needed. Prices  had to be free, and the exchange rate had to be determined by  demand and supply on the market. One did not have to be a  prominent economist in that instance. The main point was to  pursue a certain policy consistently. As long as Chernomyrdin  was in a state of bewilderment over what economic policy in a  market economy is, this was successful.    However, in the summer of 1993 Gerashchenko pushed through  monetary reform. He did it professionally: He put us off guard  by statements that the currency would be exchanged until the end  of the year, I went away on leave, and he struck a blow. It then  became clear that adherence to reforms proclaimed by  Chernomyrdin was a disguise, that he never considered broadly  interpreted reforms his own.    At present, "Red economic managers" play the leading role in  the government; the prime minister himself has said today that  he is proud of being a "Red director." The problem is that while  they are experienced politicians, they do not know about the  economy. To them, it is a different life. They do not understand  it.    I assure you that had it not been for the September events,  the things that happened this January might have happened in  September and October, because even then plans existed to  squeeze certain people out of the government, to reduce their  status, and to regroup forces. Individuals such as Shakhray and  Shokhin, all their desire to display loyalty to the prime  minister notwithstanding, will always remain outsiders in the  government no matter what: they are not "Red directors."  Shokhin, with his cozy thick glasses, will forever give the  impression of an intellectual who is meddling in someone else's  business. There will be more verbal glitter.    So, I was in Davos in conjunction with the prime minister,  who swore everywhere that he would combat inflation. However,  given that on 20 January he said that his target for the end of  the year was 8-9 percent, and on 25 January that the target  already was 15-18 percent, the common man is compelled to ask:  When did he speak the truth? And what kind of policy is being  pursued?    Look at just one problem--the savings of the population; not  one of the "Red economic managers" discusses it at all.  Meanwhile, this is the most important indicator of the health of  a country. A state is doomed if the population has nothing and  cannot save up. If there are savings that grow in real terms,  the country has a future because there is a foundation for  investment, for the extension of long-term credit, and for the  expansion of production. In our country savings had been  declining for two years, but began to grow in real terms in  November and December. To be sure, the trend has now changed.    So that I finish my soliloquy, after all: At present,  everyone is tired of everything. How many times can we  restructure? How many times can promises be made? Many people  have begun to talk about unity and accord: Let us come to an  agreement, they say, and it will be better for all. Or let us  unite with Belarus--and prosperity will come about right away....    O. Moroz, member of the LITERATURNAYA GAZETA editorial  board. For Belarus, that is....    B. Fedorov. Maybe for Belarus. The events that  happened in January do not allow even the relative success that  has been achieved to be built on. In January the rate of  inflation was not supposed to exceed 15 percent, whereas it was  at 22 percent. This is just the beginning: Judging by the latest  reports from the government, the Ukrainian scenario is drawing  ever closer to us. Another two or three unifications of monetary  systems--with Georgia, Tajikistan.... I think that Kazakhstan  and Uzbekistan will not be far behind--everyone wants to get at  least something....  <H5>  Mr. Gerashchenko's Scalp </H5>   Yu. Kulikov, LITERATURNAYA GAZETA deputy editor in  chief. In the State Duma you were elected chairman of the  subcommittee that will oversee credit and monetary policy. You  will get to draw a lot of Gerashchenko's blood....    B. Fedorov. You see, I am a fatalist in the sense  that I believe the progress of history cannot be stopped, and  Mr. Gerashchenko's scalp will one day hang on the wall and adorn  my house. Carthage must be destroyed. There is no doubt that he  is a talented man. He is neither a central banker, because he  does not understand what he is supposed to do, nor an economist,  because he does not know elementary things about monetary  circulation in a market economy. He is a man who managed to live  abroad for 15 years and failed to understand how the economy  works there. Incidentally, he did not manage to learn the  language properly, either. However, he is talented in terms of  his bureaucratic conditioning; he has already survived several  regimes, and he always has a paper with the right endorsement.    I think that my position will be very simple: We will begin  to hold hearings in a fundamentally different way from that of  the former Supreme Soviet, conventionally speaking, the way they  do in England. We will word 300 or 500 questions and demand  answers in writing. Thereafter officials from the Central Bank  will answer questions, this time before the subcommittee--just  as in the U.S. Congress, very quietly and amicably. After all,  we are a legislative organ, and we cannot determine the policy  of the executive authorities. However, we have a duty to know  what goes on in the Central Bank.    Naturally, I am extremely interested in the balance sheet.  The bank was actually created in December 1990, but no one has  seen the results so far. In the existing report there are a few  lines about the balance sheet at the very end, on one page.  However, when an international auditor writes in his statement  that he does not understand many things about the Central Bank,  and that he does not assume responsibility for saying that  everything in the bank is correct, these are very sophisticated  words to the effect that a lot is incorrect there.    A. Udaltsov. Now that we have you here, could you  sketch the "banking landscape" for us and name the most  respectable banks?    G. Tsitrinyak, LITERATURNAYA GAZETA commentator.  Such advertisement is expensive....    A. Udaltsov. Those with integrity will pay later.  (Laughter).    B. Fedorov. In terms of the level of development,  the banking system is ahead of many economic sectors. Previously  it did not exist, there was a niche. People came there who for  the most part had not been bankers in their earlier lives.  Gusinskiy of the Most was a director; Khodorkovskiy of the  Menatep was a chemist; Petya Korotkov, with the Russian National  Bank, worked with us at the DENGI I KREDIT magazine; I remember  taking an article to him. Certain others.... People came in who  did not have any dogmas and managed to get the system going  astoundingly fast: At present Russia already has about 2,000  banks with 4,000 branches.    I think that the banks will begin to play a quite  conspicuous  role. All of them, especially the large banks, take an interest  in politics. All of them already have something to lose if we  recall that some balance sheets already exceed $100 million, and  the opening of each branch, for example in Moscow, costs $1  million at minimum.    As I see it, there are not that many truly powerful banks  that one can work with--between 30 and 50. During the past year  the Ministry of Finance worked with 15-20 banks, and among them  were the Most, Stolichnyy, Inkombank, and Menatep. There were  also smaller banks--the Tveruniversalbank, the Russian National  Bank, and a number of banks such as the Tokobank. These banks,  whether one likes them or not, are quite reliable; they will not  disappear soon. I also like the Tekhnobank headed by Garegin  Tosunyan very much; it impresses me because it tries to think  about the entire country instead of being wrapped up solely in  its own problems.    Yu. Kulikov. As you see it, why are bankers being  killed?    B. Fedorov. Not just bankers--if you have a lot of  money and this becomes common knowledge.... However, there is  one nuance in this instance: There are quite a few people in the  banking community who are entangled in affairs that are hard to  call legitimate.    O. Moroz. You are seconding the dangerous point of  view of the Ministry of Internal Affairs--that only those  involved in criminal pursuits are being killed, they say.    B. Fedorov. No, I am not seconding it. I merely  said that this is also a fact. A large enough number of banks  which were tied to groups of a particular kind have recently  closed--this is also a fact. It is another matter that the law  enforcement organs operate so inefficiently.... Here is an  example: Everybody agrees that corruption is on the rise.  However, who has been put behind bars in the last three years?  Name them--it is just that I am interested to know.... Or taxes:  It is clear that the revenue is small, that profits are being  concealed. I called in the tax police and asked them when we  would hold at least a few well-known individuals accountable....    S. Oganyan, LITERATURNAYA GAZETA commentator. Did  you name names?    B. Fedorov. I hinted. (Laughter). So  what? Nothing happened.  <H5>  An Interesting Detail </H5>   G. Tsitrinyak. Effective 1 January, the  circulation of foreign exchange in parallel with the ruble was  discontinued. At the former foreign exchange stores they now put  prices on the merchandise in dollars, take payment in rubles,  and set their own exchange rates. Here is an official summary  report for 7 February from the newspaper SEGODNYA: The  ruble-dollar exchange rate at the "Shop No. 1" store--1,880, and  at the "NBM"--1,555. For reference: On the same day the exchange  rate of 1,560 rubles [R] to the dollar was fixed at the trading  session on the Moscow Interbank Currency Exchange. What is all  this about? Did they fail to envision that the exchange rate at  foreign exchange stores may differ from the rate at the trading  session by more than a few percentage points? Did they  officially authorize robbery?    B. Fedorov. As early as 1991 I told Gaydar's guys  that elementary rules should have been introduced at first when  currency exchange bureaus opened in a country lacking culture in  certain operations, in a country that had monopolies. Say, the  selling rate of foreign exchange in exchange bureaus or shops  should not have exceeded that on the exchange by more than 5  percent. We proposed this, but it was not accepted. However, the  Central Bank may introduce this within three seconds without a  problem.    G. Tsitrinyak. Then why has the Central Bank not  introduced it so far? After all, shoes can wait, but when one  needs drugs....    B. Fedorov. I would undertake to put this question  to Gerashchenko.    O. Moroz. What do you think about the nonpayments  crisis, and what way out do you see?    B. Fedorov. One should not promise more than one  has. In this instance, no knowledge of monetarism is required.  The unpaid sums are a myth which is associated with one point:  If the president and the prime minister of a state consider it  possible to spend as much as they want and for whatever purposes  they want, apart from the approved budget and its items of  expenditure, the budget will certainly be busted.    I even tried to explain to the government: "If you go  shopping you cannot spend more than you have in your wallet...."  Meanwhile, the state considers it possible to live any which  way. Agrarian lobbyists forced through the grain price, plus  repairs to the White House, plus 250 billion for the elections,  and so on, and so forth. The Ministry of Finance had not built  all of that into the budget. Naturally, there was no spare  money; it was taken away from someone.    Besides, to a considerable degree, legislation made it  possible not to pay; there was no mechanism for bankruptcy, nor  were there bankruptcies. Not a single director was relieved.    In general, the lack of an industrial policy was the  greatest  mistake of the year 1993, just as it is now. There were many  industrialists in the government, but there was no industrial  policy because everybody wanted to work on finance and ask for  subsidies. In essence, those who are received by the president  and the prime minister are the directors of the largest bankrupt  enterprises: Peskov from the Rosselmash or Gulko from the  Metrovagonmash.    Here is an episode: The director of a bankrupt enterprise  came in and narrated publicly that he had consulted with the  president in the company of those as bankrupt as he was, and  communicated to me confidentially: "In general, we will have you  removed, but we have not found another candidate yet. And we  will demote Chubays...." For some reason they do not consult  with the Uralmash--private capital has come along there.    O. Moroz. Therefore, do you think that the clamor  in the press on account of nonpayments is not commensurate with  the situation?    B. Fedorov. Of course. To a considerable degree  the clamor is a continuation of corporate behavior and lobbying  efforts.    D. Molchanov, LITERATURNAYA GAZETA commentator.  Some time ago Gerashchenko's deputy Solovov stated that the  Central Bank issued R11 billion in cash to the government on the  night of 3 October. What money was it and where did it go?    B. Fedorov. They did not issue anything to us.  Chernomyrdin had a question: Everything could have dragged  out--fighting was underway, banks were closed; people had to be  fed, but nobody gave anything for free. It would have been good  for the government to have a certain reserve of, specifically,  cash. It turned out that the government and the Ministry of  Finance did not have a thing. Than we decided to officially  withdraw from our account--that of the Ministry of Finance at  the Central Bank--a certain amount of cash. Of course, that  night nobody was there at the Central Bank. Commercial banks in  which we had accounts helped: After a single telephone call they  brought 10 billion. We held this money until the end of  December, when I decided thus: Why would it sit here and bear no  interest--and we returned it.    I. Rishina, LITERATURNAYA GAZETA department  editor. Today's MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI carries an interview  with Shakhray, and these words of his are made into the  headline: "...As far as the prospects for Gaydar and Fedorov, I  think that they are gone from the government for a long time,  most likely for good...." What does he mean? That you are gone,  and that the era of Shatalin plus Abalkin, who it seemed to me  could have never united, has come?    B. Fedorov. Serezha Shakhray was a good guy....  Personally, I am truly pained by the strange behavior of Mr.  Shakhray, whom I always considered to be one of the sober-minded  individuals. His alliances with certain people, his bowing down  to the policy against which he had come out.... My impression is  that he has lost his bearings, and is now grasping this fact  with difficulty.    Those who have seen the academicians' program know that it  does not have a single specific proposal. I have not yet read  Glazyev's program--the hearings are tomorrow. I have just met  the author and said: "Greetings, ideological enemy!"  (Laughter).    L. Velikanova, LITERATURNAYA GAZETA commentator.  Is there hope that the current situation may end in some  civilized way, or does a civil war or a military coup await us,  as many people predict?    B. Fedorov. I do not believe in a military coup.  However, it is unavoidable that the situation will worsen. I  think that yet another experiment will be conducted--reform "Red  economic manager"-style. Many programs will appear, although no  more programs are needed--ever! After all, the entire program  may fit on three pages: What are your priorities? What tasks do  you set with regard to savings, the exchange rate, the interest  rate, the growth of the money supply, and labor productivity?  With regard to the real income of the population and the  consumption of foodstuffs? That is all! I do not need anything  else: We will proceed from this in solving the problems of  unemployment and other problems.    Yu. Solomonov, LITERATURNAYA GAZETA deputy editor in  chief. I do not believe that Gerashchenko's scalp can be  your final objective. In this case, in the name of what do you  work?    B. Fedorov. I want major changes in the economy to  occur in my country. If only we had overcome inflation and begun  to develop quietly.... I think that after everything had been  set right it would no longer have been interesting for me, and I  would have left for an investment bank--to make money.    O. Moroz. At some point will you raise the issue  of confidence in our glorious government in the Duma after all?    B. Fedorov. There should be weighty grounds for  this, for example, the psychological barrier when inflation  reaches 30 percent. You will see that the attitude in society  will change then.    A. Udaltsov. Should we perhaps finish on this  note? Thank you for making it here, to us. It is even more  interesting for you to come "out of office," because "in office"  you need to restrain yourself somewhat on occasion.    B. Fedorov. Of course, in that case I would have  gone easier on certain names. (Laughter). However,  here is yet another interesting detail in conclusion. I quit the  State Bank, and the chairman was removed. I quit the Central  Committee--the secretary for economics was removed. I quit the  Silayev government--Silayev was removed one year later. I quit  the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development--Jacques  Attali was removed. I have now quit the government....  (Laughter).</p>

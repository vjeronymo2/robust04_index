			<p>BFN     [Text] Jeddah, May 26, SPA -- An official source has told  SPA that in completion of the statement made on Monday [23 May]  by an official source at the Ministry of Health containing  initial statistics prepared by Red Crescent and general  hospitals in Mecca and the holy places and submitted to the  minister of health, and to correct the exaggerations and  incorrect information published by some mass media, and after  reviewing figures prepared by the Mecca region and the Ministry  of Health which were completed on Thursday, we explain the  following:    Firstly, the number of deaths reported from the 1st of  Thilhijja [month of Haj -- beginning 12 May] until the end of  the 12th of Thilhijja were as reported previously 829 detailed  as follows: A -- the number of general deaths in the Mecca and  holy places areas during the first 12 days of the month of  Thilhijja were 559 including 62 cases of old age, 180 cases of  sun stroke, 136 cases of heart diseases, 22 cases of brain  vessels failure, 8 cases of malignant tumors, 14 cases of high  blood pressure, 27 cases of chest diseases, 23 cases of  accidents and 47 cases who died of other causes.    The number of deaths resulting from overcrowding at the  Jamarat on Monday afternoon reached 270 cases including 6  Saudis, 11 Egyptians, 2 Sudanese, one Yemeni, 6 Algerians, one  Jordanian, 7 Moroccans, 5 Turks, 8 Nigerians, 18 Indians, 6  Bangladeshis, 44 Pakistanis, 6 Indonesians, one Iranian, one  Ghanian, one Afghan, one Dutch, one Mauritious, one Denmark and  143 of unknown nationalities until this date.    The names of the dead persons which were found out until  Thursday have been communicated to the Saudi Press Agency to  carry them through the media both inside and outside the  Kingdom, the source said.    The source said hundreds of thousands of people headed for  Jamarat on Monday afternoon thereby neglecting the instructions  given to them by Mutawifs and broadcast by the mass media over  the previous ten days.    He added that most pilgrims raced to the Jamarat to finish  this final ritual early even before noon and many of them were  carrying their luggage on their backs which led to the  overcrowding, the falling of some and tripping of others in  addition to the haste by all.    Despite the existence of huge bridges built by the state to  facilitate the movement and despite continuous expansion work on  the roads leading to the three Jamarat, the large number of  security personnel around the area and early warnings announced  on loud speakers in various languages, terrible overcrowding  occurs at each Jamrah and lives are lost.    The source stressed that if we count the deaths of a city  with two-million population in 15 days under normal  circumstances, we will find more deaths than the cases which  occurred during this Haj season in Mecca and the holy places.    And if we take into consideration the number of pilgrims who  performed pilgrimage this year, which is more than 1.5 million  people, we will find that the percentage of deaths during this  season was a mere 0.05 percent which is a normal one.    The source wondered what is with those who race to defame  and  doubt everything that the Saudi Government has offered and still  offers to pilgrims every year when the Kingdom has spent  billions and exerted intensive efforts to provide comfort for  pilgrims.    The source said the motives of those who exaggerate the  facts  and figures and wrongly insult the Kingdom because of their  hatred and sickness of the heart which reappears for the  slightest of reasons, were known and so are the sides which  recruit those hired persons in various arenas who will be sad to  hear that the Haj season has succeeded to a great extent, thanks  to Allah, and the Moslems who came to perform Haj have done so  and returned home safely.    The source concluded that for those whose lives were taken  by  God while they were performing rituals to him obediently, we ask  Allah to have mercy on them, send them to heaven and count them  among the pious martyrs.</p>

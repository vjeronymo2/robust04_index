			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 15 Jun (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--It is  learned from the national conference on registration and  administration of foreign-funded enterprises held in Beijing  several days ago that the State Administration for Industry and  Commerce will take a series of measures to strengthen  registration and administration of foreign-funded enterprises.  The specific measures are as follows.    Strengthening and improving registration and examination of  the setting up of foreign-funded enterprises, examining the  investment they have made, investigating and prosecuting cases  involving their violations of laws and regulations, and carrying  out annual examination of their operations.    A Chinese-foreign joint-venture enterprise to which the  Chinese side only contributes its existing assets is required to  produce the Chinese side's assets assessment report confirmed by  the department in charge of administering state-owned  enterprises when it registers with the proper authorities.    For a Chinese-foreign joint-venture enterprise to which the  foreign side contributes equipment and goods, the actual prices  of the equipment and goods must be clearly stated in the  contract and confirmed by a notary office acceptable to both  sides.    If the articles of association or the contract submitted by  the Chinese-foreign joint venture violates the principle of both  sides sharing profits and risks or fails to state that both  sides will provide guarantees for their investment in loans [tou  zi dai kuan dan bao 2121 6327 6313 2949 2137 0202] in proportion  to their investment or that the Chinese side will guarantee the  rate of return on foreign investment with loans, bonds, or the  like, the relevant authority has the right to require both sides  to amend their contract; if they refuse to do so, they shall not  register.    Strengthening inspection of the supply of capital by  investors of foreign-funded enterprises. The investors must  supply the capital in full within six months of the date of  issue of their licenses if their registered capital amounts to  $2 million or less; within one year for registered capital  between $2 million and $5 million; two years for registered  capital between $5 million and $10 million; three years for  registered capital between $10 million and $30 million; and  longer for registered capital of more than $30 million subject  to the approval of the relevant authority. If the investors  fail to do so, their licenses shall be revoked.    If the Chinese side of a foreign-funded enterprise supplies  the registered capital on behalf of the foreign side, it is  unacceptable and the foreign side shall be prosecuted for  failing to supply the registered capital. If the Chinese side  obtains a license by using the name of a foreign businessman or  materials supplied by him and gives him free shares as a reward,  the license shall be revoked and the offender punished once the  offense is confirmed.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The presidents of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania have  urged the Russian president, Boris Yeltsin, to state personally  and publicly that Latvia's inclusion into the countries where  Russia intends to establish military bases is a mistake, and to  confirm his previous obligations to withdraw speedily and  completely the army from Estonia and Latvia.    The Baltic presidents also appeal to the international  community not to stand aside at a time when Russia is hardening  its policy toward these states.    The statement by the Baltic presidents was prepared  yesterday  and made public this morning. The three presidents welcome  reports from Russia that the leaders of that country's  government acknowledged that a mistake was made in the Boris  Yeltsin edict of 5 April by including Latvia among the countries  where Moscow intends to establish military bases. In welcoming  this news, we notice with concern the consequences of such  incidents to our countries, our relations with the Russian  Federation and, on the whole, to the possibilities of all  countries to work with Moscow's government, the document states.    The presidents note that such actions, such as the 5 April  edict and the Moscow decision on the same day at the  negotiations with Estonia and Latvia to repudiate matters  already agreed upon have consequences which reach much further  than the negotiations between our countries and Russia.    Such actions obviously intimidate our nations and, in  addition, they increase tension in Europe, raising the question  of the reliability of the Russian Government as a partner in  negotiations. The Baltic countries have always negotiated with  the Russian Federation benevolently, and will continue to do so.  In addition, our governments will do everything in their power  to reduce the consequences of these ill-fated incidents. But  our efforts have obvious limits, and therefore we apply to all  interested countries to help us in our efforts, the statement by  the Estonian, Latvian and Lithuanian presidents notes.</p>

			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / International Company News: Microsoft faces claim for Dollars 4.36bn MICROSOFT, the leading software supplier, said Apple Computer was seeking potentially crippling damages of Dollars 4.36bn in the long-running software copyright infringement dispute between the US companies. The outcome of the legal battle could have a profound impact upon the personal computer industry in which Microsoft is the leading software supplier. Microsoft charged Apple's claim was 'insupportable and speculative'. The company denied infringing Apple copyrights and noted the court had yet to rule on infringement. Apple filed its suit against Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard, the computer systems group, in 1988. It claimed an early version of Microsoft's Windows program produces computer screen displays copied from Apple Macintosh displays. Microsoft has since sold over 9m copies of the latest version of Windows, introduced 10 months ago, which provides IBM-compatible personal computers with ease-of-use graphical interface features, previously unique to Apple Macintosh personal computers. On Friday, Microsoft will file a motion for summary judgment, asking the court to dismiss Apple's remaining claims. It will also ask the court to apply its earlier rulings to the latest version of Windows. Apple, however, said it was 'increasingly confident' its infringement claims will be upheld and said it expected the case to go to a jury trial this summer. Hewlett-Packard, also named in the suit, has had only limited success with its NewWave program and Apple's claims against the company are expected to be much smaller. It also denies infringement.</p>

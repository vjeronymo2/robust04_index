			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] It was learned that Ho Chong, deputy chief of the  DPRK's UN mission, who was the contact for the North Korean side  in U.S.-North Korea contacts, will be replaced around 24  February. A diplomatic source in New York confirmed this on 17  February, and said that Kim Chong-su, deputy chief of the UN  mission will take his place. Since the measure to replace  Deputy Chief Ho Chong came right after North Korea announced  that it would accept full-scope nuclear inspection, it is being  presumed that this is the first step in changes in North Korea's  policy toward the United States.</p>

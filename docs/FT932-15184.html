			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / Russian and the G7: Coup defendants protest at trial THE trial of 12 former Soviet and Communist party leaders charged with high treason for organising the unsuccessful coup in August 1991 began yesterday. It opened with a flurry of claims by the defendants that they were being tried in a non-existent country by the wrong people on a punishing schedule. One of the defendants, Mr Alexander Tizyakov, 67, was taken ill half an hour before the end of the afternoon session. Mr Tizyakov, a less prominent member of the 'State Committee for the Extraordinary Situation', as the plotters called themselves, was head of the state industrialists' association. Mr Anatoly Lukyanov, former speaker of the Soviet parliament and an intimate of former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, argued that the prosecutors, drawn from the military department of the Russian Supreme Court, were biased. He noted that they would be under the command of General Pavel Grachev, the defence minister, who will be one of the witnesses. Gen Grachev came out against the plotters during the coup. Major General Anatoly Ukolov, the presiding judge, dismissed the claim, as he did an earlier plea that the case be dismissed as the court had no jurisdiction over alleged crimes committed in the Soviet Union. The defendants also argued unsuccessfully that the court's schedule be relaxed to reflect the age of the defendants - many in their sixties - and the fact that they had spent a year in prison. The trial of the plotters promises to be long and at times rivetting - as several of them, including Mr Lukyanov and Mr Valentin Pavlov, the former Soviet prime minister, have made clear that they will point the finger at Mr Gorbachev as having been at least a passive accomplice in developing the coup. Mr Pavlov said in a recent interview that the former Soviet president had indicated that he would return from his vacation villa - where he was under house arrest - to lead the country if the plot succeeded.</p>

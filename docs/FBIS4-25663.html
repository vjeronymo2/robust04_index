			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 14 (XINHUA) -- The Democratic  People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) announced here Monday [13  June] that it would immediately withdraw from the International  Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and reject any inspections of its  nuclear facilities, local newspaper "NODONG SINMUN" reported  today.    The DPRK strongly accused the IAEA of committing an act of  grave encroachment on the dignity and sovereignty of the DPRK,  saying that it is a prelude to U.N. "sanctions".    On June 10, the IAEA adopted a resolution urging the DPRK to  open its "military facilities" and suspend the agency's  assistance to the DPRK.    In response to the IAEA's resolution, the DPRK Foreign  Ministry was authorized to declare as follows:    Firstly, we will immediately withdraw from the IAEA. We will  consider invalid all the unreasonable "resolutions" adopted by  the agency with regard to our issue and will not be bound to any  rules or resolutions of the agency hereafter.    Without the agency we can develop our independent nuclear  power industry and expand international cooperation in the realm  of nuclear activities.    Secondly, we declare that inspections for the continuity of  safeguards which we have accepted in our unique status will no  longer be allowed.    No unreasonable inspection can be allowed until a decision  has been made for us to return to the nuclear Nonproliferation  Treaty or to completely withdraw from it.    Hence, the agency's inspectors will have nothing to do any  more in our country.    Thirdly, we strongly reaffirm our position that U.N.  "sanctions" will be regarded immediately as a declaration of war.    The statement said that the DPRK's position will never  change  until the nuclear issue has been solved fairly through dialogue  and negotiation.</p>

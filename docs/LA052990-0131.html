			<p><P> May 29, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> HARVARD PRESIDENT BOK RESIGNS AFTER 20 YEARS;  </P> <P> EDUCATION: HE BROADENED THE UNIVERSITY'S REPUTATION AND ENDOWMENT DURING STORMY  YEARS OF PROTEST.  </P> <P> Harvard University President Derek C. Bok, who during two tumultous decades  broadened both the reputation and endowment at the nation's oldest university,  today announced his resignation.  </P> <P> "I haven't yet had time to think about what to do next," Bok said in a  statement.  </P> <P> Bok, who became president in 1971, said that "it is time for me to step down  and allow a new president to provide fresh energy and continuity of leadership  through the next decade."  </P> <P> Peter Costa, a spokesman for the university, said he could not elaborate on  Bok's reasons for the resignation, which will take effect at the end of the  1990-91 academic year.  </P> <P> Bok, a Stanford University graduate, earned a law degree from Harvard in 1954.  He joined the Harvard Law School faculty in 1958 and became dean of the school  in 1968.  </P> <P> Bok, 60, is a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and author  of several books, including one on labor law that he wrote with Watergate  prosecutor Archibald Cox.  </P> <P> During his tenure as Harvard's president, Bok established both the John F.  Kennedy School of Government and revived an undergraduate core curriculum based  on the study of classics.  </P> <P> Bok often made headlines with his conservative views on education and business,  including a controversial stand against a movement for total divestment of the  university's holdings in stocks of companies doing business in South Africa.  </P> <P> Among his challenges, he headed the school during sometimes violent  anti-Vietnam War demonstrations, and negotiated over the years with black  students and professors arguing for better minority representation.  </P> <P> But most of Bok's efforts were low-key as he worked behind the scenes to  maintain traditions at Harvard, which celebrated its 350th anniversary in 1986  and has one of the nation's richest endowments.  </P> <P> There had been wide speculation in academic circles that Bok would step down  following the celebration marking the Cambridge institution's founding.  </P> <P> Bok is the son of a Pennsylvania Supreme Court judge, and his grandmother was  the daughter of H. K. Curtis, founder of Curtis Publishing Co., which published  the Saturday Evening Post.  </P> <P> He married Sissela Myrdal, the daughter of Swedish sociologist Gunnar Myrdal,  in 1955. He and his wife, who has a doctorate in philosophy from Harvard and  teaches at Brandeis University, have three children.  </P></p>

			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / International Company News: Thomson likely to shelve bid for LTV missiles side THOMSON-CSF, the state-owned French defence group, is reportedly close to withdrawing its Dollars 300m bid for the missile operations of US steel group LTV in a last-ditch attempt to prevent the US government from blocking the deal. The French group is expected to shelve its bid temporarily to give itself more time to find a US partner willing to run the missile company on its behalf. Thomson hopes that such an arrangement, which would leave it as only a passive investor in the missile operation, will assuage US fears that foreign ownership of a key US arms contractor compromises national security. Three US companies - Northrop, Loral and Raytheon - have been approached as possible partners for Thomson, but none have so far agreed to join the acquisition. Thomson has had to move quickly because a high-level US government committee set up to review the deal is believed ready to recommend to President George Bush on Monday that the acquisition be blocked on security grounds. The committee met for the final time earlier this week, and sources in Washington said yesterday that it was highly unlikely that Thomson would be able to clinch a deal with a US partner in time to persuade the committee to reverse its recommendation. Congressmen and US defence chiefs have let the committee know their concern about allowing LTV's missiles operations to fall into the hands of a company controlled by a foreign government. Thomson is 58 per cent owned by the French state. The committee has also looked into allegations that the French group broke US and French export laws when selling arms to Iraq during the 1980s. Only yesterday, the US Customs confirmed it was investigating whether export laws were violated in a 1985 sale of Thomson lasers to Iraq. Thomson denies ever breaking US or French export laws. Although Thomson's withdrawal of its bid would only be temporary, the latest development has cast a shadow over LTV's attempts to sell its assets and emerge from six years of bankruptcy proceedings. Two months ago, a New York bankruptcy court gave Thomson the right to buy LTV's missiles unit over a rival, but higher, joint bid by Martin Marietta and Lockheed. Unions representing 14,000 steel workers employed by LTV yesterday rejected demands for cuts in wages and benefits and voted to authorise a strike if the company rejects its labour contract. LTV broke off negotiations with the unions two weeks ago and asked permission from a US bankruptcy court to terminate its labour and pensions agreements with the union. A court hearing on the company's request is set for July 13. If LTV recieves court approval, and goes on to reject the contract, the unions say they will go out on strike. The steelworkers are prohibited by law from striking until LTV breaks the contract.</p>

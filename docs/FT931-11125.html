			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / Yugo importer in receivership THE UK importer of Serbian-built Yugo cars has gone into administrative receivership. Zastava (GB), based at Reading in Berkshire, which was controlled by the Serbian export/import agent BSE Genex and traded as Yugo Cars, has seen its supply of cars and replacement parts dry up since the United Nations imposed sanctions on Serbia in May. The receiver, Mr Keith Selley of Robson Taylor, the Bristol and Bath based accountants, said he expected to complete a sale, possibly today, of Zastava's assets - mainly spare parts and a few vehicles.</p>

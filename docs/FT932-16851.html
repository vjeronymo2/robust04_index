			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / Leading Article: The lure of bonds Domestic investors were out in force at the Bank of England's Pounds 3bn auction of 20-year gilt-edged stock on Wednesday. But so, too, were the foreigners; and that suggests that there is at least one respect in which the chancellor's Budget strategy has started to work. There is nothing that bond investors and currency markets like more than the sound of a domestic electorate wailing about tax increases and spending cuts. Hence the stability of sterling over the past 10 days and the success of an auction that was regarded by analysts as far from a foregone conclusion. Having established a floor under sterling the authorities will now be hoping that this was a mere down payment - the start of a great tidal flow of foreign capital into gilts. For those British investors who have been brought up to regard gilt-edged stock as one of the more effective ways of blowing an inheritance, this is all a little baffling. But in a global market there will always be investors for whom someone else's government's bonds, however suspect to the native eye, will appear more attractive than their own. This is particularly true when viewed from the perspective of the world's biggest creditor country, Japan. While the Japanese equity market was suffering from a collapse as severe as the Wall Street crash of 1929, yen bond prices were rising at an astonishing rate. Investors who bought at the bottom in autumn 1990 had nearly doubled their money by February of this year. But then the party came to an end, just as the equity market started to recover. With government bond yields back around the 4 1/4 -4 1/2 per cent range, compared with just under 4 per cent a month ago, the case for investing in British gilts at 8 1/2 per cent looks more compelling, especially for insurance companies that are permitted to pay bonuses out of income, but not out of capital. Much the same argument applies elsewhere. With the US economy recovering, the dollar weakening further against the yen and the post-election bond market boomlet at an end, recession-hit Europe is the obvious place for the Japanese to go. All they have to do is to convince themselves of the credibility of a given currency parity, and the extra income over and above the yield on Japanese bonds becomes attractive. French bonds An obvious case in point is France, now that the elections are out of the way. It is clear that French real rates of interest are too high, because of the commitment to the franc fort policy. It is also clear that D-Mark rates, to which French rates are tied via the Exchange Rate Mechanism, will come down in the course of the year, since output in the German economy has been contracting sharply. If the French manage to stay within the ERM, short-term interest rates will fall closer to German rates, reflecting a reduction in the risk premium - the compensation required by the market for not being in more stable D-Marks. And this in turn will exert a gravitational pull on long bond rates, which now stand at around 7 1/4 per cent, compared with an underlying inflation rate of around 2 per cent. Increased credibility Certainly the credibility of the franc appears to have increased over the past month. Three month Euro franc interest rates have come down from 12 to 10 per cent since late February - far more than the comparable decline in D-Mark rates from 8.25 to 7.88 per cent. So the risk premium is narrowing. The new French government, meantime, is helping the process by tightening fiscal policy and promising independence for the Bank of France by August. But before jumping to the conclusion that the market in European integration is making a comeback, it is important to recognise that international investors can have short time horizons. Today they are impressed by the anti-inflationary credentials of Mr Edouard Balladur, who heads the new centre-right government. But if strains develop in Franco-German relations and rising unemployment causes political ructions, the market will suddenly remember that it was Mr Balladur, who as minister of finance in the incoming Chirac government in 1986, responded to over-high real rates of interest by prompting an immediate devaluation of the franc within the ERM. Nor are the wider tensions within the ERM resolved. The Danish referendum in May provides another hurdle for the system. With the peseta looking vulnerable on fundamentals, a far bigger hurdle may be presented by the Spanish elections in the autumn. The currency markets are still willing to test the weaker members of the system. If the result is realignment, then the franc could come back into the firing line. For the British government, the currency markets are no longer such a daunting obstacle. But with a Pounds 50bn public sector borrowing requirement, their verdict remains important because it holds the key to future funding. The authorities will be put to the test monthly, in each new gilt auction. It may not always be so comfortable.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Furayh Abu-Middayn, member of the </F> Palestinian National Authority, by As'ad 'Attar in Gaza; date  not given -- recorded]    [Text] [Abu-Middayn] There is an agreement in place. We  are not negotiating new terms. We are implementing the Cairo  agreement. However, the Palestinian police are coming up  against obstacles not of their own making, but that originate in  the donor nations that made decisions and signed pacts with the  Palestinians calling for the police force to be outfitted with  all the necessary materiel -- cars, communications equipment,  and transport. We have yet to take delivery of all the promised  cars. Some of the cars that have to be sent to certain  locations have no radios. We cannot send a soldier on an  assignment without communications. We cannot send a civilian  instead of a military vehicle. The donor nations have yet to  honor the commitments they have given to the Palestinians. It  is the major stumbling block to the Palestinian movement and  deployment in the Gaza strip. We are not negotiating new terms.  We will implement the agreement in place.    ['Attar] But the police have already started their duties.    [Abu-Middayn] Today, joint patrols were in action. The  Palestinians maintain a presence in all designated road  junctions, where the settlers are allowed to travel under  Israeli military escort. The Palestinians are present in all  the localities indicated on the maps that were signed in Cairo.    ['Attar] Have security checkpoints been set up close to the  Erez roadblock?    [Abu-Middayn] There is a Palestinian security checkpoint  there. There is one in the Military Police area and on the Gaza  coast near Netzarim. The checkpoints shown on the map are now  all in place.    ['Attar] And what about disarming civilians who still  possess firearms?    [Abu-Middayn] It would be more to the point to talk about  controlling the use of weapons rather than disarming civilians.  Civilians need to apply for a license before they can carry  firearms. The acquisition of weapons should be barred if no  reasonable, plausible grounds can be advanced by applicants,  especially since a considerable number of weapons have found  their way into the hands of criminals, who used them in hold-ups  and robberies. We are addressing this issue, which we do not  take lightly. It is an issue that must be controlled. We will  institute a ban on firing in the air as is customary on happy  and festive occasions. The security authorities will take care  of that. This issue figures high on the list of our priorities.  This is because weapons have been alarmingly readily available  in the past year.    ['Attar] The Israeli-Palestinian committees convened today.  Have new security arrangements been worked out?    [Abu-Middayn] Every day brings new developments. But I have  not left my office today. God willing, I will have the details  this afternoon.    ['Attar] Thank you, Attorney Furayh Abu-Middayn.    [Abu-Middayn] Thank you.</p>

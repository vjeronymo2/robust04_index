			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Ridiculous Utterances of Nuclear Criminal" -- KCNA </F> headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, May 25 (KCNA) -- Secretary General of the  Japan Renewal Party (Shinseito) Ozawa, a backstage manipulator  of Japan's nuclear armament and moves to become a military  power, reportedly said in his recent speech that North Korea's  "nuclear arms development program" might drive the situation on  the Korean peninsula to a "grave crisis".    This balderdash of Ozawa is a sheer distortion of the  reality. It is a despicable jargon meant to do harm to the DPRK  and justify their criminal nuclear ambition on any account.    We cannot but be on our guard against the extreme moves  hostile to Korea of Ozawa who let out a provocative remark again  this time.    It is an undeniable stark reality that the basic factor of  the critical phase being created in the situation of the Korean  peninsula is the reckless war manoeuvres of the U.S. and  Japanese reactionaries and the South Korean puppet clique to  contain the DPRK militarily.    We cannot but take a serious view of the fact that the  Japanese reactionaries are stepping up their nuclear armament  and moves for the conversion of Japan into a military power with  the aim of staging a comeback to Korea and establishing  domination over Asia.    Today Japan is totally branded as an unpardonable nuclear  criminal and has to sit in the dock before the international  community.    The recent outburst of Ozawa revealed his extremely  insidious  attempt to lay the blame at other's door, avoid sitting in the  dock before the international community and realize their  criminal nuclear ambition at any cost.    The Japanese authorities, instead of trying to do harm to  the  DPRK over its fictitious "nuclear issue", must declare the total  amount of plutonium kept in hiding, apologize for the criminal  act and no longer resort to moves for nuclear armament.</p>

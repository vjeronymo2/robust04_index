			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / Observer: Perennial bloomer For some odd reason the Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society, one of the more hardy of its species, wants to be loved by gardeners. It's paying Pounds 400,000 to sponsor Classic FM's answer to BBC Radio 4's Gardeners' Question Time. Having pruned back its range of financial products, C&amp;G is now diversifying into sweatshirts, watering cans and gardening gloves. The thinking seems to be that since many C&amp;G customers like gardening, they will come to love the C&amp;G. Maybe so, but the weeding out of the society's unprofitable members arouses a suspicion; is C&amp;G uprooting itself from the building society movement and preparing to blossom into a greedy plc?</p>

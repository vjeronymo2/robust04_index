			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Employer proposes, over a period of two (2) years, to purchase annually a portion of such Assets at a price each year of $341,692. This amount is one half of the book value of the Assets, as of June 30, 1993. It has been represented that immediately following the execution of the first sale of the Assets to the Employer, the book value of the Assets remaining in the Plan will constitute no more than 22.06% of the assets held at that time by the Plan, without taking into consideration in determining the value of the Plan's assets either projected contributions by the Employer or by its employees or anticipated income to the Plan from other assets. The Employer has agreed to pay the costs of the exemption application, including providing notice to all interested persons. Further, it is represented that the Plan will incur no fees, commissions, or expenses as a result of the sales of the Assets to the Employer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. In an appraisal, dated September 7, 1993, Cyril Ann Mandelbaum, CPA (Ms. Mandelbaum) estimated the fair market value of the Assets which are the subject of this proposed exemption. Ms. Mandelbaum represents that she is qualified to appraise the Assets in that she is a certified public accountant and a member of the American Society of Appraisers. Further, Ms. Mandelbaum represents her independence in that she does not have any present or contemplated future interest in the Assets or any other interest which might tend to prevent her from making a fair and unbiased appraisal of such Assets. According to Ms. Mandelbaum, the estimated value of the Preferred Stock and the Common Stock is $1.19 and $1.18 per share, respectively. Taking into consideration a 28% discount for the minority interest held by the Plan in the Preferred Stock and the Common Stock and a discount of 35% for the lack of marketability of such stock, Ms. Mandelbaum reached a value for the Plan's interest in both the Preferred Stock and the Common Stock at between zero and $.53 per share. With respect to the value of the Secured Note I Fund, Ms. Mandelbaum indicates that there is little likelihood of Notes issued by the Secured Note I Fund ever being paid. Accordingly, in the opinion of Ms. Mandelbaum the Plan's interest in the Secured Note I Fund is assumed to be worthless.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9. In summary, the applicant, represents that the proposed transactions meet the statutory criteria for an exemption under section 408(a) of the Act because:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) The Plan will be able to invest the proceeds from such sales in more profitable assets;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) The Plan will receive no less than fair market value of such Assets on the date of each sale and in the aggregate the Plan will receive no less than $683,384 for the sale of all of the Assets to the Employer;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Each of the sales will be a one time transaction for cash;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) The Plan will incur no costs, fees, commissions, or other expenses as a result of the sales of the Assets to the Employer; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

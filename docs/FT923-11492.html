			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / International Company News: Buffett buys 15% of US group GENERAL Dynamics, the US defence group which is slimming down, yesterday received a powerful endorsement of its strategy when Berkshire Hathaway, the investment group led by Mr Warren Buffett, announced the acquisition of a 15 per cent stake in the business. Mr Buffett is one of the most highly regarded investors in the US and tends to take large stakes in companies for the long term. His acquisition of 4.35m shares in General Dynamics will have cost about Dollars 300m. The company's share price rose Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 75 1/4 yesterday morning on the New York stock exchange. General Dynamics recently carried out a Dutch auction tender offer to buy back 13.2m of its shares at a price of Dollars 72.25 a share under its commitment to return to investors much of the excess cash the business is throwing off. Most of this cash is coming from a programme to dispose of peripheral businesses and concentrate on four core sectors of the defence business. Mr William Anders, chairman and architect of the new strategy, said yesterday he was pleased with Berkshire Hathaway's expression of confidence in the company and its new management team. Members and trusts of Chicago's Crown and Goodman families, which have long held a large stake in General Dynamics, reduced this from 22 per cent to about 14.4 per cent under the Dutch auction.</p>

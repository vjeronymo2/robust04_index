			<p>940228 FT  28 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Scottish Power in talks over Clydesdale deal Scottish Power is negotiating to extend its network of retail stores into England by buying part of the Clydesdale Group, the Glasgow-based electrical retailer which went into receivership last month. It is thought to be interested primarily in Clydesdale's 30 out-of-town superstores south of the border. However, the deal is believed to include the 12 superstores in Scotland, where Scottish Power already has about 30 per cent of the white goods market, as well as the group's rental business. Scottish Power's offer has led to the abandonment of a Pounds 46m bid for the entire group from Clydesdale managers. This group is not interested in buying Clydesdale's high street shops without its Scottish superstores and the rental operation. But it hopes Scottish Power may be forced by the Office of Fair Trading to shed the Scottish superstores as soon as a deal is concluded, which might enable it to revive the bid.</p>

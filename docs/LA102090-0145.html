			<p><P> October 20, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DANCE AND MUSIC REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> SOUTHWEST SOCIETY OPENS 4TH SEASON  </P> <P> In today's conservative musical world of brand names and recycled repertory,  the presenter with the courage to offer unhackneyed music is usually new to the  game or about to lose it.  </P> <P> Not so the Southwest Chamber Music Society, which survives, and opened its  fourth season Thursday night in Salmon Hall at Chapman College. Southwest, to  call it by its first name, specializes in the unusual and neglected, and seems  to draw an enthusiastic audience also friendly to discovery.  </P> <P> At the same time, the society's players -- a flexible ensemble of 11 members,  plus guests -- appear to operate several notches above the mainstream of  ad-hoc, temporary groups often producing in this musical neighborhood: At its  best, the organization makes music in a serious and polished way.  </P> <P> The performances given at Chapman on Thursday -- and scheduled to be repeated  Friday night in Pasadena -- lived up to that standard.  </P> <P> Led by violinist Peter Marsh, the quintet playing Brahms' Opus 111 and the  United States premiere of Anthony Payne's "Consort Music" -- violinist Lawrence  Sonderling, violists Jan Karlin and Robin Ross, and cellist Richard Treat --  did so with passion, deep detailing and a projected sense of style.  </P> <P> There were areas of unfinished preparation in the wondrous G-major Quintet --  some overplaying here, misgauging of balances there, momentary lapses of  intonation. But they did not harm the overall sweep of the piece, a work of  valedictory statements despite its heroic stance.  </P> <P> Payne's haunting but active quarter-hour essay on introversion/extroversion  turned out a strong contrast to Brahms' less reserved musical oratory. Atonal  in dialect, emotionally dichotomous "Consort Music" leaves the listener feeling  spent but optimistic. Nothing seemed tentative.  </P> <P> This program began with piano. In memory of Leonard Bernstein, Albert Dominguez  played "Five Anniversaries" (1954) with all its cherishable Americanisms  intact: wit, directness, sentiment, sassiness and vulnerability.  </P> <P> Then, to open the program proper, Marsh and Dominguez gave a reading of Elgar's  Second Sonata that reminded us again of the grandeur of much of the British  composer's output. An elegant duo, Marsh-Dominguez produced a comprehensive and  full-throated aural view of this handsome, deeply felt, aristocratic and  sometimes self-mocking score. Why do we not hear it more often?

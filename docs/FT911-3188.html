			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / World Stock Markets (America): Lockheed team rise after record order for fighters Wall Street SPORADIC buying of blue chips and weaker bond rates helped the Dow Jones Industrial Average to move higher yesterday, although the broader market remained subdued, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. The Dow closed 19.06 up at 2,949.51. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index, regarded as a better measure of overall market performance, improved only 1.00 to 382.76. The Nasdaq composite of over-the-counter stocks continued its recent recovery, rising 2.37 to 498.45. New York SE turnover was again modest, amounting to 167m shares, while advancing issues narrowly outpaced declines by 842 to 727. Analysts expect the market to trade in a narrow range either side of its present levels, with 2,920 the likely floor on the Dow and 3,000 the ceiling. Although prices were helped yesterday by a fall in yields on government bonds, some analysts are worried that the number of market bulls  -investors who expect prices to continue rising - remains high. This is often a sign that prices have peaked and sentiment is about to turn. Defence shares were in the limelight after the US Air Force awarded the largest contract ever in the defence industry's history to a team led by Lockheed, to build a new generation of fighter aircraft. The Pentagon is expected to order 650 fighters to be built, valued at a total of Dollars 95bn. Lockheed's partners are Boeing, General Dynamics and United Technologies. The news lifted Lockheed Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 42 7/8 on turnover of 2.5m, Boeing Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 47 3/4 , United Technologies Dollars 1 to Dollars 46 1/8 and General Dynamics Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 37 1/2 . Shares in the two companies which lost in the five-year competition for the fighter contract fell sharply. Northrop dropped Dollars 3 1/4 to Dollars 23 3/4 and McDonnell Douglas Dollars 3 5/8 to Dollars 46 3/4 . Goodyear put on Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 21 3/8 in spite of reporting a 7.2 per cent decline in worldwide sales in the first quarter and a net loss of Dollars 90m, mostly due to a Dollars 65m charge against earnings. The shares rose because the bad news had been discounted. Fleet/Norstar, the Maine-based bank, continued to benefit from news of its takeover of the failed Bank of New England, adding Dollars 1 1/2 at Dollars 23 1/8 . Procter &amp; Gamble unveiled a meagre 1.8 per cent rise in earnings per share for the first quarter, news which pushed the consumer product group's stock Dollars  7/8 lower to Dollars 84. NCR moved Dollars 1 1/2 higher to Dollars 103 3/8 on hopes that the computer group would shortly reach an agreement with AT&amp;T, the telecommunications giant, ending a five-month long takeover battle. AT&amp;T rose Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 37 1/8 . On the Nasdaq, the ADRs of Reuters, the UK information group, weakened Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars 42 on turnover of 2.2m shares after a Merrill Lynch analyst in London cut his investment rating on the stock ahead of the group's annual meeting to be held tomorrow. Canada TORONTO stocks closed mixed after trading in a thin range throughout the session. The composite index inched up 1.7 to 3,504.1, although falls held an edge over rises by 284 to 271. Volume was a light 21.5m shares. Canada's leading banks cut their prime rates, but investors are still waiting for a monetary policy switch by the US Federal Reserve. Some investors are worried about the Ontario budget to be unveiled on Monday, the first by the province's socialist government.</p>

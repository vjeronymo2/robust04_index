Grace opts for a steady domesticity  that is simultaneously reassuring and confining, while Caroline pursues  romance, risking security for more intense passion. Hazzard's intriguing  characters move like the clockwork components of an orerry through a series of  surprising yet logical revelations.  </P></p>

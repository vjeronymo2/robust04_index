			<p><P> September 23, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UNITED JOINS OTHER AIRLINES IN BOOSTING DISCOUNT TICKET PRICES  </P> <P> United Airlines, the second-largest U.S. air carrier, Friday joined the  industry's move to higher discount fares, virtually assuring that the fares  will not be rolled back.  </P> <P> Eastern Airlines also raised prices Friday to the level set Wednesday by  American Airlines, the No. 1 U.S. carrier, and joined Thursday by Delta Air  Lines, Continental Airlines, Pan American World Airways and Trans World  Airlines.  </P> <P> USAir and Northwest Airlines were still holding out against the fare increases  late Friday but were considered certain to match the industry's new price  level.  </P> <P> United said it had raised its prices on nonrefundable 14-day advance purchase  tickets by an average of 5%.  </P> <P> Steeper increases were imposed on the seven-day advance purchase ticket  category, and penalties for canceling them were doubled.  </P> <P> When one airline raises or lowers fares, competitors usually decide quickly  whether to match the new price structure. If they decide not to change, the  competitive pressure often forces the leader to pull back.  </P> <P> But this time, with most of the major airlines having said their fares will  rise next Friday, it will be up to the traveling public to determine whether  the higher fares remain in force.  </P> <P> "The big boys are all on board now (and) . . . it appears that the higher fares  will stick," said Hans J. Plickert, an airline analyst with the Transportation  Group, an affiliate of New York-based Paine Webber investment firm.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Makes Economic Sense'  </P> <P> "But it now all depends on how the airlines read the tea leaves. It depends on  what kind of reservation patterns they see for the next couple of weeks,"  Plickert said. "Who knows? In two or three weeks they might institute some new  promotional fares or rescind the hikes."  </P> <P> Eastern spokesman Robin Matell said, "It appears that the adjustment makes  economic sense at this time." Eastern has been in Chapter 11 bankruptcy  proceedings since March 9, and its pilots, flight attendants and machinists  have been on strike since March 4.  </P> <P> Northwest and USAir both said that they would continue to study their options  until next week.  </P></p>

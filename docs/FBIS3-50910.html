			<p>Language: <F P=105> Creole </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Leontes Dorzilme] </F>   [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] In less than four hours, the  parliamentarians of the 45th legislature will be returning to  the Parliament in order to see if they can untangle the  political crisis. Today will mark the opening of the seventh  session of the 45th legislature. After more than three months  of vacation, extended by the chronic absenteeism of some  parliamentarians, there is more suspense and doubt about whether  today's session will succeed. The stakes are considerable  because the session, which should be held today, 10 January, is  aimed at meeting a constitutional requirement, according to the  latest statements by National Assembly President Firmin  Jean-Louis. However, since September 1991 the unforeseeable has  become the rule of the game; everything, including the concerns  of the 18 January 1993 parliamentarians, has become a series of  situations outside the 1987 Constitution.    During a news conference held on 7 January, Senator Firmin  Jean-Louis asked those who were elected on 18 January 1993 not  to execute their threats to return to Parliament. He added that  the return of the 18 January representatives will have a lot of  incalculable consequences on the good functioning of the  parliamentary institution.    Contacted by our station, Sen. Dejean Belizaire, leader of  the controversial parliamentarians, said that he maintains his  stand. He told Signal Radio that all the 18 January  parliamentarians would participate in the reopening of the  parliamentary work that will take place today. [passage omitted]  Sen. Belizaire concluded that the Parliament has never been  more abnormal than during the time when the 18 January  parliamentarians decided to temporarily stand aloof. [passage  omitted]</p>

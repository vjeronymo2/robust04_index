			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Ministry of International Trade and Industry  [MITI], on 22 February, started work verifying that past trade  agreements with the United States have yielded results, to  refute the U.S. claim that "trade pacts concluded with Japan so  far have not produced any results."    MITI plans to classify agreements into three categories,  according to subject, such as those related to deregulation or  improved transparency in procedures. It will then determine  what specific action has been taken since the agreements became  effective, using as evaluation criteria market share figures and  the rate of growth of purchases. MITI wants to then explain the  results of this evaluation to the Untied States, even though it  is far from certain how much understanding the United States  will show.    The United States expressed doubt at the economic framework  talks that any results have been achieved by the bilateral trade  accords reached so far. U.S. President Bill Clinton said at a  news conference held after the Japan-U.S. summit: "Over 30  agreements have been concluded with Japan since 1980. But its  market is still more closed than that of any of the seven  industrialized nations where imports are concerned."    Given this situation, MITI has decided to reevaluate the  achievements of accords concluded so far to create a favorable  atmosphere for the reopening of talks. A senior MITI official  explained: "The failure of the past accords is the basis for  U.S. arguments on setting numerical targets in the future. All  that means is that even if the framework talks resumed now, it  would only lead to a repetition of the same kind of  confrontation."    Specifically, the evaluation will be carried out on 22  agreements between Japan and the United States, plus a further  five concluded by NTT [Nippon Telegraph and Telephone  Corporation].    To decide how effective those accords have been, MITI will  use quantitative results. For example, NTT's procurement of  foreign products has increased by 46 percent since 1980; imports  of beef almost doubled from 1988 to 1992; the number of foreign  lawyers in Japan, which was only 31 in 1988, has increased to  81. The ministry wants to present these as a concrete basis for  refuting U.S. claims.    Even on the issue of cellular phones, over which the United  States is now considering taking sanctions, MITI will ask for  U.S. understanding by explaining that the number of the base  stations for Motorola-type phones, which was zero when the  cellular phone accord was concluded in 1989, will reach 189 by  April this year.    Some admit that, in terms of numbers, results are scarce for  private sector accords, such as those on glass sheets and forest  products. But MITI wants to seek U.S. understanding, saying:  "Great results have been produced in areas like government  procurement where the Japanese and U.S. Governments are  involved."</p>

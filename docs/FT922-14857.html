			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / International Company News: General Motors puts gas turbine unit up for sale GENERAL MOTORS, the US automotive manufacturer in the throes of a large restructuring, yesterday announced that it was looking for a buyer for its Allison Gas Turbine Division. Allison, which employs some 6,300 people, designs and makes turbine engines for the aerospace, industrial and marine industries. GM bought the business in 1929. It has manufacturing and research facilities in Indianapolis, Indiana. Mr William Hoglund, GM's executive vice-president in charge of Allison, said the sale was consistent with the company's strategy of focusing its energy on improving the competitive position of its core businesses. Last December GM announced plans for more than 70,000 jobs losses and the closure of 21 plants over the next few years to return its heavily loss-making US automotive operations to profit. In recent years the group has spun off several large peripheral activities, notably Detroit Diesel, which under new management turned from a loss-maker into a profitable, entrepreneurial business. Mr Blake Wallace, general manager of Allison, yesterday sought to reassure customers - many of them foreign governments - that it would keep its operations stable during the transition from GM ownership.</p>

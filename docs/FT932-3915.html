			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Freed to seek the rights for recovery - Why Wimpey is making its first large share issue since 1963 GEORGE WIMPEY, having been released from the shackles imposed by its late founder Sir Godfrey Mitchell, has moved swiftly to raise the funds it urgently requires if it is to continue its recuperation. The former west London stone mason which grew to dominate the UK construction industry in the 1950s and 1960s before falling on harder times, will use the cash to buy housing land and re-equip its UK and US quarrying businesses. It is the largest but not the first housebuilder to make a cash call on shareholders this spring on the grounds that the housing market is at last recovering. Share issues have recently been announced by Berkeley Group and Bellway, among others. Two years ago there was an even bigger spurt of rights issues as companies took advantage of the short-lived euphoria which followed the end of the Gulf war. Much of this money was used to repair badly damaged balance sheets rather than the expansion which was promised shareholders. Wimpey has previously been discouraged from issuing shares by the existence of Grove Charity Management, established by Sir Godfrey in 1955, and which until March this year owned 34 per cent of Wimpey making it the company's largest shareholder. Grove's charitable obligations would have made it very difficult for it to support a rights issue, particularly in a business which last year incurred a Pounds 112.4m pre-tax loss and cut dividend payments to shareholders to 5.25p compared with 10.5p in 1991. The trust's sale 11 weeks ago of a 29 per cent stake raised more than Pounds 110m and freed the company to make its first large share issue since it was floated in 1963. Only four times in the past 15 years has Wimpey exceeded the Pounds 57.2m pre-tax profit made in 1978. Last year's loss, after an exceptional provision of Pounds 113.8m, was the worst in the company's 110-year history. These figures, however, belie the improvement which has been made in the company's financial position. Net debt as a proportion of shareholders' funds has fallen from almost 60 per cent in 1991 to 30 per cent at the end of last year - the lowest level of gearing for a decade. The reduction in debt has been achieved largely through the disposal of commercial property and 'peripheral' businesses which have raised more than Pounds 300m since Mr Joe Dwyer was promoted to chief executive in 1991. The decision by Sir Clifford Chetwood, who previously combined the role of chairman and chief executive, to stand down permitted Mr Dwyer to take decisions which might have been more difficult for a long-standing chief executive faced with unwinding previous business decisions and personal loyalties to staff and colleagues. The early decision to dispose of satellite businesses such as offshore engineering and waste disposal meant that the company was able to achieve better prices than if it had waited a further 18 months, by which time some of these industries were also flagging. Tarmac has still to announce the sale of its waste disposal operations 20 months after Wimpey sold its waste business for Pounds 105m. Wimpey, having refocused around the three core activities of housebuilding, construction and minerals, has now reached the point when it needs to raise more cash if it is to take advantage of a recovery in UK housebuilding. Investment in new plant and equipment for UK and US quarries, delayed for at least two years while the balance sheet was repaired, also cannot be postponed much longer. Further sales of UK commercial property investments and housing land in the US would help pay for this but are unlikely says Wimpey because of 'the continued depressed conditions in these markets.' Dwyer says that Wimpey will be disappointed if it does not sell a minimum of 7,000 homes in the UK this year, compared with 5,600 in 1992. The company needs to increase its land holdings from 14,850 plots with planning permission to more than 20,000 plots if sales are to rise to 9,000 a year by the mid 1990s. Proceeds from the rights issue will also be used to expand and modernise the group's quarrying operations in the US and UK. Mr Dwyer says demand for aggregates has shown signs of improving in eastern US while prices have begun to firm in the UK. 'The work we have done over the past two years means that we are excellently placed to take advantage of a recovery which I believe is underway. 'Land prices have bottomed and in one or two instances have started to rise. By next year we expect prices to be generally higher. Purchasing land now will enable the group to achieve attractive margins on sales next year and 1995,' said Mr Dwyer. His success may be judged more on how wisely he spends the proceeds from the company's first rights rather than on the success in reducing the company's borrowings. 'The job is only half done,' was the verdict from analysts yesterday as Wimpey shares slipped 3p to 184p.</p>

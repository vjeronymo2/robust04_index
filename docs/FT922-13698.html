			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Shrinking right out of sight THE RACE to miniaturise never seems to end. Photocopiers, image scanners and facsimile machines are getting even smaller and lighter as a result of a development by Toshiba, the Japanese electronics group. Toshiba said it will introduce a new series of linear image sensor modules that are half the size and weight of the conventional sensors based on charge coupled devices (CCDs) which lie at the heart of equipment used to scan and transfer optical data. The new sensor unit has a simpler structure than traditional CCD-based sensors but can still attain high resolution. Toshiba: Japan, 03 3457 2104/5.</p>

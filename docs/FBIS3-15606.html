The Russian delegation at the past, 17th round of talks with  Estonia said Russia won't sign the agreement on troop  withdrawal, the document that also sets the deadlines for the  process, before Estonia ensures what Russia defines as social  guarantees for its retired military in Estonia, and fulfills  certain other conditions.    Officials at the British Embassy in Tallinn told BNS that  the  British Government was worried about such a statement from  Russia.    "According to the final act of the CSCE Helsinki meeting of  1992, Russia must withdraw its troops from Estonia quickly, in  an orderly manner, and completely, and must not tie it to other  issues. Also the international community has repeatedly  underscored that the withdrawal of troops must take place  without any additional conditions. Therefore, the Russian  troops must be pulled out by Aug. 31 this year, as was earlier  announced," the statement by the British Government says.    It also says that good relations between Estonia and Russia  are essential to ensuring stability in whole Europe and that the  withdrawal of Russian troops is a vital part of this process.</p>

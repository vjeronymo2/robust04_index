			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: A dash of cold water For those of a bearish disposition, the fact that the London equity market fell this week is evidence that the election rally has finally run out of steam. More sanguine observers might conclude that in a week which saw the collapse of Olympia &amp; York, a string of gloomy company results and unsettling news on wage inflation, a 43-point fall was not bad going. In truth, UK investors had been rather spoilt of late: not only by the election result itself, but by a surprisingly early cut in base rates and a degree of premature confidence about economic recovery. If the latest dose of realism makes for a spell of reflection, it may be no bad thing. This is not to say that the travails of O&amp;Y can quite be dismissed. At the domestic level, UK bank and property shares scarcely suffered yesterday, since the event was largely discounted. At the global level, the sum of Pounds 7bn is not big enough seriously to damage the structure of world banking. But O&amp;Y could still serve in a small way to hamper economic recovery, particularly in Europe. The traditional way to ease the effects of such a collapse on borrowers and lenders is through asset inflation, lower interest rates or both. The former is not on offer anywhere in the developed world. The latter is not available in the D-Mark zone, including the UK. At the margin, the result must be lower property prices and less willingness by bankers to help recovery by lending. At the same time, this week's 7.5 per cent rise in UK wages is in gruesome contrast to the levels being fought over in Germany. If nothing else, this suggests caution about the recently popular thesis that UK interest rates can be cut below Germany's. There is no reason yet to suppose that the gains made by the equity market since the election are under threat. It may be a dull start to the summer just the same.</p>

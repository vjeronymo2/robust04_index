			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / Where companies own the mines, but the union owns the towns: Laurie Morse visits America's strike-ridden coal country ABOUT 60 miles southeast of St Louis, Missouri, just after county highway 13 splits off on its own and crosses the Kaskaskia river, the first hand-lettered sign appears on the roadside: 'This is UMWA Country.' As the road travels south and east the signs get thicker and more insistent. Tiny towns appear every five miles or so, linked by country roads trimmed with ditches overgrown with sweet clover, orange lilies and cheat. 'Peabody guilty of unfair labour practices,' neat white signs on the lawns of modest midwestern houses declare. Peabody, a subsidiary of Hanson of the UK, owns the coal fields, but the United Mineworkers Union of America owns the towns. The coal mines that run beneath most of this rural acreage and feed the area's families and economy are fallow, shut down by a selective strike begun by the UMWA on May 10. The UMWA has been without a contract with the nation's biggest coal companies, represented by the Bituminous Coal Operators Association, since February 1. At issue is job security, with union miners seeking a contract guarantee to receive jobs at any new mines BCOA companies or their subsidiaries open. The union has escalated the strike gradually, until about 14,000 of its 60,000 miners are on the picket lines and all the BCOA companies have been targeted. The union proposes to add to the strike until the BCOA gives in. The BCOA contends union miners are less productive than non-union colliers. In a press conference on Wednesday, Mr B R 'Bobby' Brown, president of Consol Energy and chief negotiator for the BCOA was firm: 'The BCOA will not give every new job to the UMWA. The BCOA will not structure the contract to aid union organising.' Mr Richard Trumka, UMWA president, says BCOA companies have circumvented the 1988 labour agreement by opening new mines under subsidiaries they claim are not bound to the union. Both sides are finding excuses not to return to the bargaining table. Marissa, Illinois sits in coal country, a region known geologically as the Illinois basin, a bowl-shaped lump of coal touching five states where reserves are enormous, barely tapped, and sufficient to power the US for hundreds of years. Peabody mines here, with Arch Minerals, and Consolidated Coal Company, which is partly owned by the German company Rheinbraun AG. Unlike Arch and Consol, Peabody is not yet operating non-union mines, but may join the trend with a subsidiary, Premier. As the power companies pay more to clean up their emissions to meet clean air regulations, they compensate by paying less for the 'dirty' coal. Some utilities have turned away from coal altogether, and use alternative fuels. Illinois coal prices have dropped to Dollars 22 a ton in the 1990s from more than Dollars 60 during the 1970s coal boom. The resulting slump has led to a rash of mine sales and consolidations. Mr George 'Sam' Shiflett, president of Peabody coal and chairman of the BCOA, says to remain competitive coal companies need more flexibility than the union contract allows. The strike, he says, risks losing the company's utility contracts, and could shut the mines permanently. With about 10,000 union miners in Illinois already unemployed, the strike could seriously damage the union and its members. However, Mr John Cox, regional director of the UMWA and a veteran organiser, insists that job security at stake in the strike are all the more vital because of the economic climate. He cites union demographics. The average age of a UMWA miner is 46, up from 26 in 1973. Too young to retire and too old to start a second career, they want security, not higher wages and benefits. Near strike headquarters in Marissa, Peabody's Baldwin mine is tapped out and slated to close in three months, strike or no strike. If Peabody opens a new hole nearby under the Premier name, miners such as Mr Steve Hodges, a fourth generation UMWA miner who has worked for Peabody for 20 of his 38 years, are not likely to be hired. Mr Hodges' only means of keeping his family's generous health benefits, vacations, and a Dollars 20-per-hour wage is to be successful in the strike. Otherwise, he says, he will be on the street, looking for work at Dollars 5 per hour. Peabody made millions of dollars from its mines last year, he says, and should want his experienced labour.</p>

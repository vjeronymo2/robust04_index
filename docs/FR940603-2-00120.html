Savannah <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  to the James River Reserve Fleet (JRRF), (2) change responsibility for the performance of radiological health physics coverage, surveillance and response to the U.S. Army Center for Public Works, Humphries Engineering Center, (3) change the composition of the Review and Audit Committee to be consistent with the deletion of PPDA as a co-licensee, and (4) make other minor changes and discontinue public access to the facility. PPDA has decided to discontinue use of the ship as a museum exhibit and return the ship to MARAD, which has retained ownership. The ship was removed from the PPDA pier on May 24, 1994, under the existing license. The ship will be towed to Baltimore, Maryland, for drydock repairs, also under the existing license. The ship will then be relocated to the JRRF, near Fort Eustis, Virginia for long term storage. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Need for Proposed Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed action is needed in order to remove the PPDA as co-licensee, to relocate the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> N.S. Savannah <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  to the JRRF, near Fort Eustis, Virginia, for long term storage following repairs in drydock, and to change Technical Specifications consistent with these changes in licensee and location. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Environmental Impact of the Proposed Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The potential environmental impact associated with this action is the relocation of the ship to the JRRF for long term storage. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With regard to potential radiological impacts, twenty two years ago, the reactor was defueled, the control rods were disengaged from their mechanisms, primary system pump rotors were removed from the pumps and other physical changes were performed to make the reactor permanently inoperable. Core internals and primary system piping and components are entombed within the heavily shielded containment vessel which is sealed. No additional radioactivity will be produced, and the existing residual radioactivity will continue to decrease by radioactive decay. From 1981 until 1993, the ship was open to the public as a museum with no measurable radiation exposure to any member of the public. To prevent public access to potential contaminated or radiation areas in the ship, these areas will continue to be sealed and security for the ship will be maintained at the JRRF effectively similar to that in place at the PPDA pier. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the unlikely event that radioactive waste is produced on the ship, all waste will be removed, packaged, and shipped offsite, or released in accordance with radiological control procedures that are in place and implemented to ensure that releases of radioactive wastes from the facility are within the limits of 10 CFR part 20 and are as low as reasonably achievable (ALARA). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on the review of the proposed activities associated with the license amendment for the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> N.S. Savannah <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , the staff has determined that there will be no significant increase in the amounts of effluents that may be released offsite, and no significant increase in individual or cumulative occupational or population radiation exposure. Accordingly, the Commission concludes that the proposed action would result in no significant radiological environmental impact. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With regard to potential non-radiological impacts, after leaving drydock, the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> N.S. Savannah <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  will be towed to the JRRF using established navigation channels. It will be located within the existing boundary of the Reserve Fleet in the James River. No extensive preparation to the site will be required for the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> N.S. Savannah <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . It is intended to moor the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> N.S. Savannah <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  alongside the decommissioned U.S. Army Corps of Engineers MH&hyph;1A Floating Nuclear Power Barge Sturgis. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The staff has determined that the proposed activities will not result in any significant impacts on air, water, land, or biota in the area or have any other significant non-radiological environmental impact. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on the above, the Commission concludes that there are no significant environmental impacts associated with the proposed amendment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Alternatives to the Proposed Actions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Since the Commission concluded that there are no significant environmental impacts that would result from the proposed action, any alternative with equal or greater environmental impacts need not be evaluated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The principal alternative to the proposed amendment request would be to deny the request. This denial would force the PPDA to remain as a co-licensee and the ship to be returned to the PPDA pier. However, the PPDA returned the ship to the MARAD in accordance with the charter agreement and the authorizing legislation (Pub. L. 96&hyph;311, August 28, 1980). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Alternative Use of Resources <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> No alternatives appear that will have different or lesser effect on the use of available resources. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Agencies and Persons Consulted <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NRC staff consulted the U.S. Coast Guard, and the States of South Carolina and Virginia in reviewing the request from the licensees. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Finding Of No Significant Impact <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental impact statement for the proposed action based upon the foregoing environmental assessment.

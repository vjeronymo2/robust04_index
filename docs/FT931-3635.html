			<p>930315 FT  15 MAR 93 / Construction Contracts: Office development plan in Zimbabwe A joint venture between COSTAIN (AFRICA) and JOHN SISK &amp; SON (PVT) has been awarded a contract by Old Mutual Properties for a major office development in Harare, worth Pounds 24m. The project, which is believed to be the largest of its kind in Zimbabwe, includes 26,000 sq metres of office space in two identical blocks, separated by an eight-storey atrium, which will provide an American-style indoor shopping mall, with more than 50 shops. The development includes an unusual passive ventilation system, which will provide comfortable conditions within the building, without resorting to air conditioning. The scheme, developed by the architect, Pearce Partnership and engineers Ove Arup &amp; Partners, uses the concrete structure of the building to produce cool air. The Costain-Sisk joint venture has reduced the anticipated construction programme by offering an alternative design for the substructure works. This allows the two-storey basement car park to be constructed using a bored pile perimeter retaining wall, which will be geonailed back to the surrounding soil to give temporary lateral support whilst the permanent construction is under way. Work on the development is scheduled for completion in 34 months time.</p>

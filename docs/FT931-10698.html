			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / Fashion: Designer dweeb names the guilty - The cynicism of shop assistants stops Michael Thompson-Noel looking lean and virile THOMAS Mann said: dress like a bourgeois, think like a revolutionary. My trouble is that I dress like a dweeb, which tends to have a numbing effect on most of the cerebral cortex. Fashionwise - or even merely clotheswise - I am dead from the neck down. How did this come about? It is not that I do not care, for I cringe with embarrassment every time I see a reflection of myself scuttling past shop windows or find myself, in restaurants, steered towards the table by the door. It is not that I lack imagination. In my mind's eye I see myself as tall and lean and virile - just like Zoltan Solymosi, a dancer with the Royal Ballet, who featured, with Darcey Bussell, in a recent issue of Vanity Fair. In one of the photographs Solymosi wore a Daks dinner suit with a black polo-neck sweater. I could wear them easily. I could even wear the tartan sequinned evening jacket and black lycra bodysuit that Darcey Bussell was modelling. It is not that I lack the money. I am not awash in funds: 45.6 per cent of my net salary goes in mortgage payments to the chairman of Abbey National, to keep him sleek and plump. But I could afford some stylish clothes if I would only visit the stores. It is not that I lack taste. Nor that I do not travel, or stay in posh hotels. Nor - as you mention it - am I as thick as two short planks and somehow unaware that women look more kindly on men like Zoltan Solymosi, with his nice shoes and waistcoats and expensively-kept hair, than they do on men like me. Some of the soup stains on my ties have soup stains of their own. Neither of my suits fits. I take refuge in blazers. Most of my sweaters are gross. My shoes pinch. Whom do I blame for the state of my wardrobe? Answer: the retailers. Reason: their cynicism and shortsightedness in employing shop assistants who have sold me, over the years, clothes that neither fit nor suit me. Is stupidity a job requirement for people who work in retailing? I counted my clothes this week. I only own two suits (one from Gieves &amp; Hawkes, bought in a sale, which needs major surgery and should never have been sold to me); two blazers; one sports jacket; 10 peculiar pairs of trousers; one French-made blouson (the only decent thing I own); one hideous linen safari jacket (Simpson of Piccadilly: they should have refused to let me near it, let alone take it home); one tatty raincoat; no overcoat at all; one dinner suit; 20 shirts (only two from Jermyn Street); an idiot's collection of ties; three pairs of shoes; seven mothy sweaters and a disreputable collection of T-shirts and Bermuda shorts. I hate shopping for clothes. In my experience, shop assistants are either sneeringly superior or too bored or lazy to offer appropriate help or advice. It has to be dragged out of them. They think that their role is to flog me duff clothes with minimum expenditure of time or energy. I blame their bosses. (I blame myself a bit, but not as much as the bosses). The only time I was sent packing was by an Austin Reed salesman. It was winter. I needed some shoes in a hurry. The salesman studied my feet, then rolled his eyes despairingly. He said: 'You have extremely narrow feet, Sir. I couldn't begin to help. There is nothing in the store - nor at any of our branches - that could fit such narrow feet. You need specialist advice, Sir. I expect I could find an address, but it may not be in London. You may have to make a rail journey.' He was off his head, of course. I do not have narrow feet. He probably had a hangover - just wanted to get rid of me. But if more sales assistants were more honest more often, I would accumulate fewer unsuitable clothes. I would not hate shopping. As a result, I would shop more frequently and spend the money necessary to keep my wardrobe up-to-date. Because they do not train their staff properly, clothes retailers must be cheating themselves of millions in lost turnover. If they raised their game, I might even become interested in fashion. Roll over Zoltan Solymosi; hello Darcey Bussell.</p>

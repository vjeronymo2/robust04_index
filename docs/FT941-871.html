			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Oasis has designs on spring float with Pounds 60m valuation Michael and Maurice Bennett, the brothers who teamed up with designer Jeff Banks in the 1970s to create the Warehouse high street chain, are planning to bring their latest retail success to the market with the flotation this spring of Oasis. A medium priced women's wear retailer, Oasis is likely to have a market value of more than Pounds 60m following the placing and public offer of about half the share capital. The two brothers and a third board member, Mr Vivian Scott, are expected to retain most of their shares, currently totalling 60 per cent of the group. Oasis intends to use the market to expand, although it will receive only about Pounds 2m of the flotation proceeds. It currently runs 55 shops and expects to double this number within the next three to four years. The company is also aiming to prepare for possible acquisitions. Mr Michael Bennett, chairman, is keen to expand the Oasis concept to other fashion retailers, as well as tap into the lucrative brand licensing market around the world. Oasis is targeted at women between the ages of 18 and 35 who prefer natural fibres and comfortable clothes. The group was set up in the early 1980s by a husband and wife team to sell ethnic clothing, but collapsed under crippling rents and a disastrous foray into the property market. In 1991, the receivers were called in. The Bennett brothers, who had taken a stake in 1988 and begun to reposition the group, bought Oasis for Pounds 1.6m. Since then, profits have jumped from Pounds 1.12m for the 47 weeks ended January 25 1992 to Pounds 5.57m last year, with margins weakening only slightly from 55.9 per cent to 55.7 per cent. Sales have risen in the same period from Pounds 9.6m to Pounds 29m. The group has no bank debt and cash of Pounds 4.9m. Sponsors to the float are Robert Fleming, the merchant bank. The broker is Panmure Gordon.</p>

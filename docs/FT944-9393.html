			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / Import boom spurs fall in Japan's trade surplus Japan's trade surplus fell faster than expected for the third month in a row in October, thanks to an import boom. Economists greeted this as fresh evidence of change in the country's economic structure. The politically contentious trade balance shrank by 15.2 per cent compared with the same month last year to Dollars 9.28bn (Pounds 5.65bn). That is well below the lowest forecast by Tokyo economists, and likely to strengthen Japan's position in trade talks this week with the US and, separately, the European Union. This brings the three-month moving average for the surplus to Dollars 8.47bn, the lowest since May 1992. A finance ministry official said the surplus was now at a turning point. Imports surged ahead in October by 24 per cent to Dollars 25.34bn, more than twice as fast as exports, up by 10.4 per cent to Dollars 34.62bn according to preliminary finance ministry figures. Sales of foreign goods in Japan have risen in dollar terms every month this year. Import penetration of the domestic market may be growing, said economists. The yen's rise against the dollar has made many imports cheaper in the Japanese currency. There has also been an increase in imports from the growing number of Japanese factories which flee high-cost Japan for cheaper overseas locations. Japan's domestic market is also gradually growing again and hence sucking in imports. The rise in domestic demand was underlined yesterday by separate official reports of a 0.7 per cent rise in private sector machinery orders in the year to September and a 9.8 per cent rise in steel output in October, to reach a three-year high. Previous rises in imports on this scale, in the mid 1980s, have been led by European luxury goods. The latest increases have been more broadly based, geographically and by sector. Imports have grown across all nine industrial sectors measured by the finance ministry, from food to machines, as well as from all Japan's seven main trade regions. The surplus with the US fell for the first time in eight months, by 6.8 per cent to Dollars 4.79bn, helped by a 26.4 per cent rise in imports. October was the fourth consecutive month in which Japan's purchases from the US grew faster than its sales to the US. Imports from the European Union rose even faster, by 33.6 per cent, while the rest of Asia sold 21.7 per cent more to Japan than it did a year ago.</p>

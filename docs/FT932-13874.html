			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Fuelling Russia's drive for reform - Andrew Gowers talks to Moscow's newly-appointed energy minister MR YURI Shafranik does not look like a man carrying the future prospects of Russian President Boris Yeltsin's economic reforms on his shoulders. Yet assuming that Mr Yeltsin survives this Sunday's constitutional referendum, the job Mr Shafranik has just inherited - that of minister for fuel and energy - will be as important as any other in the Russian government in determining whether Russia's shattered economy stands a chance of recovery. The new minister, appointed in January after a six-month hiatus following the sacking of his predecessor, knows perfectly well what is at stake. In an interview yesterday, he agreed that reform was inseparable from the task of turning round the troubled energy sector, still Russia's most important industry and its largest source of hard currency earnings. 'Oil', he said, 'is the guarantee of reforms and of the resurrection of Russia. The poor situation in the industry is a big problem for reforms. Everyone understands this, including people in the west' - possibly an oblique reference to President Bill Clinton, who singled out energy projects for special assistance in the aid package he presented at his Vancouver summit with Mr Yeltsin. To describe the industry's performance as poor is an understatement, as Mr Shafranik also has reason to know from his previous job as governor of Russia's main oil-producing region, Tyumen in Siberia. Although Russia remains the world's largest oil producer, output has been falling for more than three years; the oilfields are starved of investment and machinery; waste and neglect are endemic. Nor is there any prospect of a rapid improvement. The minister expects output, which plunged by 61m tonnes in 1992, to continue falling more slowly this year (to 350m tonnes) and next before touching bottom in 1995 - when he warns Russia will be in danger of being unable to fulfil all its own energy needs. Overseeing that turnround is only one of the challenges crowding Mr Shafranik's in-tray. Others include continuing the reorganisation of the oil industry into large joint-stock companies in preparation for eventual partial privatisation and addressing the chronic inefficiency of energy use, which has risen by 38 per cent per unit of industrial production in the last three years. Yet another, hardly less intractable, challenge is to generate sorely needed foreign investment in the industry - whether in rehabilitating delapidated oilfields or exploring and exploiting new ones. Attractive as Russia ought to be to western oil majors, they have hardly begun to invest there on the necessary scale. One reason is the omnipresent political uncertainty. But as important a deterrent is the punitive tax regime with which the authorities have encumbered the industry over the past year. Energy experts in Moscow reckon that export taxes, royalties and other assorted levies add up to a tax take of 55 per cent on oil export revenue - before operating and transport costs. That is enough to wipe out any prospect of a return on investment in many cases. The minister is refreshingly candid on the tax problem - and on his ability to solve it at a time of severe government budget deficits and spiralling demands for funds at national and local level. 'You have to understand we are in a period of transition, when everything is changing,' he says. 'Certainly I am not satisfied with the tax policy we are pursuing. I try to influence it on my level.' Mr Shafranik says he is working on producing tax breaks for the industry and points to a decree issued in March providing incentives for opening new oil, coal and gas fields and repairing existing ones. More breaks should follow for refining and machinery manufacture. This last is a priority area, since the collapse of the Soviet Union - in whose rulers' wisdom, 80 per cent of the country's oilfield equipment capacity was located in the now independent republic of Azerbaijan - deprived Russia of a vital industry. Mr Shafranik says the real need now is for investment in local manufacturing. 'Foreign companies which want to sell machines to us but are not keen on joint production here in Russia will definitely lose,' he warns. 'If oil production goes down, we run short of hard currency and will not long be able to pay for machines. So companies which would not like to create manufacturing sites here will lose.' If that sounds ominously dirigiste, it is out of character. The energy minister is as ardent a marketeer as any member of Mr Yeltsin's cabinet. As governor of Tyumen, he lobbied vigorously for a liberalisation of Russian domestic energy prices on the argument that the region needed a fair rent for its resources. His views have not changed, although he now adds a note of caution. Cheap fuel, he says, is a drug, and Russia will take time to kick the habit - just as Russia now accepts that Ukraine, with which it was bitterly at odds over oil prices until a few weeks ago, will have to be allowed time to adjust to the free market. Fuel prices are probably Mr Shafranik's hottest political potato. A close second, however, comes Russia's ailing coal mining sector, and here too he does not duck the issues. Yesterday he repeated his blunt warning that many mines in the Kuzbass region of Siberia, whose militant miners played a part in the ousting of Mikhail Gorbachev and could yet cause trouble for Mr Yelstin, were inefficient and would have to close. He coupled it, however, with an invitation to foreign investors. 'Pits which have worked out their resources will be closed. And we will create the conditions for foreign investors to open new pits.' If only it - and the rest of Russia's struggle for reform - were so simple.</p>

			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / US inflation rate bonus for Clinton THE Clinton administration will inherit the best inflation outlook for a generation, according to figures released yesterday. Data on production and exports, however, confirm that the pace of recovery from recession is likely to remain subdued by the standards of previous upturns. The Labour Department said consumer prices rose 0.1 per cent last month and by 2.9 per cent in the year to December. With the exception of a temporary dip in inflation below 2 per cent in 1986, reflecting the halving of oil prices that year, this was the lowest annual increase since the mid-1960s. The fall in inflation from an underlying rate of about 5 per cent in the late 1980s reflects a long period of economic stagnation and the conservative monetary policies of the Federal Reserve, the US central bank, which lowered interest rates only gradually during the recession. Some analysts, however, fear that if the recovery gains momentum, inflationary pressures will re-emerge later this year or in 1994. The outlook for production remains modestly encouraging. The Fed yesterday reported a 0.3 per cent rise in industrial output last month, taking the annual increase to 2.9 per cent. This followed a 0.4 per cent rise in November and a revised increase of 0.7 per cent in October. The improvement was uneven, with much of last month's gain reflecting a 5 per cent surge in the output of motor vehicles and parts. Production of information processing and industrial equipment was also strong. However, excluding cars, overall output of consumer goods was flat last month. The rate of capacity utilisation in industry inched higher to 79.3 per cent against 79.2 per cent in November. Separately the Commerce Department reported an increase in the merchandise trade deficit to Dollars 7.6bn in November against Dollars 7.2bn in October. This reflected a 2.8 per cent decline in exports which was only partially offset by a smaller percentage decline in imports. The trade deficit deteriorated sharply in the second half of last year as the US domestic recovery coincided with a downturn in many overseas markets, including Europe and Japan. The deficit for the first 11 months of last year was Dollars 75.5bn against Dollars 59.2bn in the same period of 1991. Most analysts are projecting a further deterioration this year as higher demand in an expanding US economy sucks in more imports.</p>

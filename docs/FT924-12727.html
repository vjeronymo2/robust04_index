			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / Survey of World Car Industry (19): Sudden death of a golden age - The year when Japan's domestic cars market forgot to grow IF THERE was one thing Japan's automobile companies could always count on, it was being able to sell cars to the Japanese public in steadily rising numbers. This happy situation at home provided an enormous source of strength for the industry - yielding ever increasing cash flow and profits that supported the industry's enormous international expansion of the past decade. This golden era has come to an abrupt end. Indeed, the prolonged weakness in domestic demand, coming at the tail end of an investment boom, has left the industry with vast overcapacity - with the ability to make nearly 13m passenger cars a year stacked against current production of just over 9m. The question facing the industry is no longer when growth will resume; it is when and how severely the domestic industry may have to shrink. This is a question that no Japanese car company is yet willing to face squarely. Cutting capacity runs against the basic ethic of Japanese-style management. Yet the pressure on the industry has become enormous. In the 10 years to 1990 domestic vehicle sales in all categories measured by registration grew in every year by an average of 4.5 per cent. In the three years to 1990, with domestic demand stoked by historically low interest rates, passenger car sales roared ahead by 16 per cent a year. From 1987 to 1990, domestic car sales grew by 56 per cent to 5.1m units, including both minicars and the rapidly-growing luxury sector. These were heady days. The low interest rates, combined with a booming stock market, reduced the cost of raising capital for the car companies to one per cent and less. As a result the companies had money and they spent it to expand capacity aimed at meeting demand that appeared to grow insatiably, with the public buying ever larger and more exotic cars. Yet suddenly, just as Toyota, Nissan, and Mazda are opening new assembly plants at home, demand has collapsed. 1990 itself was a bad year. Car sales dropped by 4.6 per cent to 4.87m vehicles. This year sales have fallen steadily, and are likely to finish the year roughly 5 per cent down from 1991. While this is bad enough in itself, the prospects for a recovery in sales look extremely dim. Mr Richard Ko, automobile analyst in Tokyo at Barclays de Zoete Wedd Securities, taking into account factors such as household income, passenger car vehicle stock, and household assets, has projected that 1993 will see no growth in vehicles sales. In 1994 he estimates sales will grow by only 1.7 per cent, and by just 3 per cent in 1995. This will be insufficient to return sales to the record level set in 1990. Japan's per capita car ownership is the lowest among industrial countries, with 286 cars per thousand population in 1990 compared to 400 in the UK and 667 in the USA. Yet with Japan's population ageing rapidly, and with road congestion a severe problem everywhere in the country, there is little hope that the Japanese market will ever again be a source of sustained, rapid growth. The impact of the downturn in the domestic market has been severe. Parent company operating profits at Japan's five biggest automobile companies were off by an unweighted average of 44 per cent in fiscal 1992. Properly weighted the average would be much worse, with Toyota, which supplies 40 per cent of the domestic market, down by 63.1 per cent, and Nissan, number two, off 72 per cent. The outlook for this year has grown steadily worse. Nissan said in late August that it would post a parent-company after-tax loss of Y20bn, and would suspended its interim dividend payment. Mazda said its net profits would plunge by 62 per cent, and the company has decided to cut dividend payments by 20 per cent this year. In spite of the forecast, many analysts believe Mazda will stay in the black only with difficulty. The response to this severe decline, so far, has been relatively muted, as the car companies have selected items from the thumb-worn menu of Japanese management practices. Nissan, perhaps most severely affected, has decided to reduce hiring so as to shrink the company's workforce by 4,000, or 6 per cent, in the next three years by attrition. Part-time employment throughout the industry has been chopped back, although this is impossible to measure with any precision. Overtime has also been cut, along with executive salaries. Most companies are operating plants on single shifts, but this decline in output has not yet been fast enough to move bulging inventories of unsold cars off the lots. There has been much talk in the industry of saving costs by means of more clever and economical engineering. All companies are making efforts to reduce the variety of parts that go into a single car, thereby restricting consumer choice. Efforts are also being made to use more common parts in different vehicle models. Toyota, however, has questioned whether this effort can result in significant savings. A senior executive at Mitsubishi Motors says the cost to consumers could actually rise, if this strategy is adopted, since parts specifications would have to be standardised to meet the highest tolerance in a class of vehicles. Every company but Toyota talks about wanting to lengthen model cycles and charge higher prices for cars. But if Toyota does not lead the way, which now looks unlikely, no other car company could withstand the pressure of trying to go it alone. The years ahead, therefore, look very much like a survival of the fittest. Unless the market returns to health more quickly than envisioned, financially weaker players, such as Nissan or Mazda, may have to take more drastic measures to stay in the running.</p>

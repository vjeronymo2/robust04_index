			<p>BFN     [Text] President Hafiz al-Asad received U.S. Secretary of  State Warren Christopher in the People's Palace at 1130 today.  The meeting was attended by Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' and  Dennis Ross, the U.S. Middle East peace coordinator.    Christopher conveyed to the president a message from U.S.  President Bill Clinton in which he emphasizes the U.S. desire to  continue its efforts to realize substantive progress in the  peace process.    President Hafiz al-Asad expressed his appreciation for the  U.S. efforts and stressed Syria's desire to continue the peace  process to realize a just and comprehensive solution for the  Arab-Israeli dispute in accordance with international  resolutions and the land-for-peace principle. Mr. Christopher  briefed the president on the results of his talks in Israel  which demonstrated that the differences are wide and great  because of the large distance between the Israeli stand and the  pillars of peace which were established at the Madrid  conference. In this regard, the president reaffirmed Syria's  stand and its adherence to the bases of the peace process based  on UN Security Council resolutions which commit Israel to full  withdrawal to the 4 June 1967 borders in order to realize just  and comprehensive peace in the region.</p>

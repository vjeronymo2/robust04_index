			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / SDR initiative to help poor Joint UK-US plans to end a long dispute halting issue of new reserve assets by the International Monetary Fund will be designed to help poor developing nations as well as Russia and other former communist countries, Mr Kenneth Clarke, UK chancellor, said. Mr Clarke, giving the first official confirmation of last Monday's Financial Times report of a UK-US initiative to allow the IMF to boost the official reserves of its member countries, said London and Washington would put forward plans for an 'equity' allocation of special drawing rights (SDRs) at next week's IMF annual meeting in Madrid. This proposal, designed to strengthen the finances of 37 IMF members which have joined the fund since the last SDR issue in 1981, would be of particular benefit to Russia and many other former eastern bloc states. The chancellor said Britain also wanted the poorest developing countries to benefit from the package. He said the US and UK did not agree with proposals from Mr Michel Camdessus, IMF managing director, for a general allocation of SDRs to all IMF members but they were prepared to suggest a 'pro rata' allocation alongside an equity issue of SDRs. This, it is hoped, would help secure the necessary 85 per cent support of the IMF membership for a change in the fund articles that would allow an equity allocation. The pro rata allocation would give 'reasonable allocations to some of the poorest countries', Mr Clarke said. It would lift IMF members' SDR holdings to 'an agreed benchmark level, subject to every IMF member receiving a prescribed minimum allocation' as a percentage of the individual country's quota or shareholding in the fund. The plans will be discussed by Group of Seven finance ministers on Saturday, where Germany, long an opponent of new SDRs, can be expected to give them an especially critical scrutiny.</p>

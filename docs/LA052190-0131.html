			<p><P> May 21, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> RANCH PAINTS ITS CADILLACS PINK  </P> <P> The legendary Cadillac Ranch outside Amarillo has been refurbished.  </P> <P> The 10 Cadillacs -- planted in the ground radiator first along Interstate 10 as  an artistic statement -- were painted flat gray in January as part of a  commercial for Lincoln Town Cars.  </P> <P> But the ranch's caretaker, Stanley Marsh 3 (he prefers "3" to "III"), didn't  like the new color. "The cars are supposed to be cheery and they looked dull,  like it was an undercoat," Marsh said.  </P> <P> So he had them painted bright pink. "It had nothing to do with any of those  rock 'n' roll songs about pink Cadillacs," Marsh told Texas Monthly magazine.  "I did it for my wife on Valentine's Day." Marsh says he preferred the battered  and bashed condition the cars were in before they were cleaned up for the  commercial. "All that graffiti and vandalism gave them a real patina, like  those Chinese vases that increase in value with each crack," he said. "It shows  people love their monuments."  </P></p>

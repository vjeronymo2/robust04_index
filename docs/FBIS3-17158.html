He was speaking at the end of talks with  his German counterpart Klaus Kinkel.    Kozyrev said he and Kinkel held two hours of talks to  discuss  how to clear the ground for Yeltsin's visit as well as "over a  score of other problems and some international issues." He  spoke of German support to Moscow's approaches for cooperation  with the G7 nations, the European Union and the Council of  Europe.    Kinkel in turn pledged his country's commitment to getting a  Russian-EU deal signed as soon as possible. He said Germany  would take over the EU presidency from July 1 which would give  it more leverage to influence the situation. "We are aware that  Russia is in a hard position and it needs support," Kinkel said.  He also spoke of receiving Kozyrev's assurances that Moscow  would sign the NATO-sponsored Partnership for Peace deal.    Kinkel does not hold with widespread speculations of signs  of  rift between Russia and the West. "Both bilaterally and  multilaterally, Russia remains Germany's reliable partner," he  said. "We can say the same about Germany," Kozyrev remarked.    Kozyrev described Tuesday's talks between Croatia and Serb  Kraina at the Russian embassy in Zagreb as a good sign and a  step in the right direction. In his view, the Washington  accords between Bosnian Muslims and Croats must be made part of  a comprehensive settlement. Kozyrev called for compromise  between the three warring Bosnian communities on the issue of  the country's integrity.    For his part, Kinkel praised Moscow's efforts to help open  Tuzla airport and create "a better environment in and around  Sarajevo."    Kinkel also spoke of wanting to take part in the first  session by a joint commission on the return of cultural  treasures, an issue which would feature on the summit agenda  though not centrally.</p>

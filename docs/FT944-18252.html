			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / Survey of New Broadcast and Communication Media (11): Testing ground gets busy - The Polish media market Large forces are again massing to divide up Poland. This time, however, the opposing sides are some of the biggest media companies in Europe. Poland is itself a considerable prize, already being the third-largest market, after Germany and the UK, with at least 1.5m dish television homes. Another million are connected to cable. It is also seen as a testing ground for how well other central and eastern European countries will respond to new media offerings. The passage this year of copyright legislation, which will help distributors and programmers fight the endemic piracy, is another attraction. The M-Net/Richemont pay-television operator FilmNet and the distributor MultiChoice Poland, a joint venture between Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Datacom and Nethold, are launching services there this month as a prelude to entering neighbouring states. MultiChoice, which has the rights to distribute News Datacom's VideoCrypt II decoder system, is offering Polish homes a package comprising the Children's Channel, the Adult Channel, Country Music Television, the home shopping service QVC, and FilmNet, a premium film channel with a small amount of sports and music. However, Poland's National Radio and Television Council intends to regulate foreign operators beaming into Poland by seeking legislation this autumn to let it license decoder distribution. It wants foreign channels to adhere to at least some of its media regulations, such as carrying a certain amount of Polish programming or respecting the 33 per cent limit on foreign ownership of channels. The council could stop the channels being carried on cable. The package will, any way, face stiff competition. The unlicensed terrestrial broadcaster Polonia 1 launched an advertising-supported, unencrypted channel last month on Eutelsat. The channel's 12 regional stations (six of which were closed by the authorities in August) had built a substantial following, with its soaps and films attracting a 25 per cent viewing share. Another possible satellite competitor could be a Compagnie Luxembourgeoise de Telediffusion RTL-7 channel. However, plans for the unencrypted entertainment service ran into difficulties in July after potential partners Reuters and Polish investors rejected the CLT's business plan. Licences have been granted this year for the first national terrestrial commercial station and three regional commercial networks. Almost every leading media operator made a bid for the national licence. It went to the all-Polish Polsat, which started out as a Eutelsat channel. Mr Murdoch had hoped to take a stake in the company, but so far it remains completely Polish. But viewers have not been impressed and it typically gains a lower viewing share than Polonia 1. Some of the disappointed bidders joined the second round of licensing. Canal Plus won licences to run a pay channel in the big cities and plans to offer the film-based service available in France. It will cost Dollars 60m to Dollars 100m to launch and will charge subscribers Dollars 12 a month. The NTP Plus consortium, backed by Central European Media Enterprises, won licences for north and central Poland, while Wisla, backed by Kinnevik, won licences for the south. The FilmNet and MultiChoice channels will be launched in November in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Slovenia and possibly Croatia. Russia, Romania, Bulgaria and the Ukraine may follow. MultiChoice is negotiating to add MTV, VH-1, Nickelodeon and the Family Channel to its package. In the Czech Republic, it will face substantial western competitors. The US-backed Central European Media Enterprises holds a licence for a satellite channel. United International Holdings of the US, which is merging its European cable networks with those of the Dutch company Philips, plans to roll out a 16-channel microwave multipoint distribution system network in Prague, Brno and Tabor in the autumn as a prelude to laying a cable system. It will also start three channels this autumn, a premium film channel and two basic tier services, one for children and the other combining general entertainment with documentaries. It may also launch a basic tier film channel, showing popular films from the 1960s to 1980s. The channels would be offered to other Czech cable operators and could also be distributed in Slovakia, where UIH has set up a joint venture with the Slovak National Cable Television Company to acquire multi- channel television systems. So far, it has 44,000 subscribers. UIH is in the process of expanding elsewhere in central Europe. It is pursuing franchises covering 1.4m of the 2.6m television homes in Bulgaria and plans to expand its stake in the Hungarian Kabelkom cable operator, which has 212,800 subscribers. It has set up a joint venture with the Romanian state-owned electrical installation company Imsat, which has cable TV projects covering 44,000 homes and is seeking licences for a further 100,000. For the region as a whole, an encouraging development is that the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development, which took a Pounds 2.6m 14.8 per cent stake in UIH's Prague Kabel Net company, is looking at cable proposals in Estonia, Slovakia and Poland. The EBRD can take a maximum one-third stake in a company. The writer is on the staff of New Media Markets, an FT newsletter</p>

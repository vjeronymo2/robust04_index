			<p><P> March 17, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EARNINGS  </P> <P> National Semiconductor Corp.: The Santa Clara, Calif.-based computer chip  maker, which has shed one division, agreed to sell another and laid off 2,000  workers to stem losses, said it had a net loss of $44.6 million in the third  quarter, contrasted with a $15.2-million profit a year before. Revenue rose 3%  to $589 million from a year earlier. The company said its chip business was  hurt by a decline in bookings in late 1988 caused by a buildup of inventory, a  slowdown in computer sales and seasonal factors.  </P></p>

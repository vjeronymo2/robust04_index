			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Janusz B.Grochowski: "Struggling With the </F> Constitution"]    [Excerpts] Professor Janina Zakrzewska says that it  is easier to say "no" than to answer a question on "how." That  is probably the main reason the Third Polish Republic continues  not to have a constitution.    Five years ago, many issues seemed much simpler. Everybody  knew what society was protesting against. The June elections to  the contract Sejm became a plebiscite putting the screws to the  authorities of the authoritarian state. Even the communists  themselves, or at least some of them, spoke against the  so-called real socialism, and that made it possible to get down  to evolutionary changes.  <H5>  "At Last in Our Own Home" </H5>   There were no major problems with making the ideological  cosmetic changes to the basic law. The eagle was crowned again,  and the adjective "socialist" was deleted. The idea of a  lifelong friendship and military alliance with the Soviet Union  was abandoned, which was made easier by the fact that the Soviet  Union was just beginning to collapse. The Army was told to be  apolitical, while "God, Honor, Motherland" was inscribed on its  flags.    So adopting a new constitution of the Third Republic seemed  like the easiest thing under the sun to do. It should be  adopted as soon as one can write a fundamental law that would  suit Polish needs and aspirations. But 3 May 1991 is the  absolutely final deadline that cannot be violated, Professor  Bronislaw Geremek used to say four years ago.    But, generally speaking, the task turned out to be much more  difficult. When it came time to give some substance to concepts  like "democracy," "state based on law," or "social justice"  (which are favored by everybody, with virtually no exceptions),  then everybody began to understand the concepts in his own way.  And the longer the debate continues, the bigger the  discrepancies that are emerging. [passage omitted]  <H5>  President or Parliament </H5>   [Presidential Aide] Professor Lech Falandysz argues that, in  the transitional period in which Poland is right now, beyond  doubt the country needs a president with quite substantial  powers. For the period of the crisis, the country needs a  system in which a relatively strong and stabilized executive  authority will be acting alongside parliament, which, however,  will not have an advantage over the executive authority. By the  way, that would be just a natural consequence of the decision  made by the Sejm, to the effect that the head of state is  elected not by the National Assembly but by citizens in popular  elections.    The proposal to subordinate the chief of the Polish Army  General Staff directly to the commander in chief of the Armed  Forces (the president) is an attempt at imposing precisely that  kind of model. Efforts to grant decisionmaking powers to the  National Security Council [RBN], which up to now was only an  advisory organ to the head of state, are also in the same tone.  As a result, the RBN would become a supergovernment whose  orders would be binding on other authorities, including the  Council of Ministers.    It is an echo of Lech Walesa's "buffer theory." The prime  minister, being responsible in front of parliament, to some  degree protects the president, who reserves only the most  important powers for himself, including the right to dismiss the  prime minister, explains Professor Falandysz.    But the problem is that practically no major political  party,  including the extraparliamentary ones, is willing to agree to  such a concept. Both the right wing and the left wing, both  post-"Solidarity" and postcommunist parties, are in favor of a  parliamentary-cabinet type of system, under which it is the Sejm  that has the upper hand in issues that are most important for  the state, with the government implementing the day-to-day  running of the country.

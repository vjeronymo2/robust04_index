			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: Lamont's sterling effort There can be no doubt, from last night's speech to the European Policy Forum, about the chancellor's determination to stick with current exchange rate policy. The alternatives were dismissed with such determined precision that he would have to resign rather than switch course. That awareness may go some way towards stifling the devaluation talk that has helped cut 3 pfennigs off sterling's value since the authorities' botched intervention in the money markets a week ago. Still, sterling is not necessarily in for an easy ride. Admittedly, part of the trouble is simply that sterling is caught in the crossfire between a weak dollar and rising D-Mark. Yesterday's UK consumer price figures may help as they show a steep drop in underlying inflation. But the rate is still well above that of France, where an ability to control inflation over the long term commands the respect of the financial community. International investors, who have been grudging buyers of gilts since the election, piled into a FFr3bn, 31-year bond for French railways last week. Even with this trust, France has not been able to undercut short-term German interest rates. Whatever Mr Lamont says, the exchange market is unlikely quickly to forget last week's money market confusion. The implicit pressure for lower interest rates suggests a measure of desperation about the economy somewhere in the government machine. Lady Thatcher's reported warning of a 'financial accident' hardly helps. Nor does continuing Maastricht uncertainty, or a possible Bundesbank decision to tighten policy after next week's review of Germany's wildly overshooting money supply. Sterling may thus spend much of the summer close to its wide-band floor within the ERM. It was there before the election, of course, but not without periodic worries about the ERM commitment possibly requiring higher interest rates. That is scant comfort for the equity market, but by now much of the new economic pessimism must already be in the price.</p>

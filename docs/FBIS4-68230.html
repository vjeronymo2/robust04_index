			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed news item: "Center Founded"] </F>   [Text] The governments of Canada, Sweden, Ukraine, and the  United States signed an agreement to establish a  scientific-technical center in Ukraine. The center's program  will focus on the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons, as well  as the consideration, approval, and financing of projects that  will employ scientists who previously worked in the armaments  sector in peaceful, civilian scientific-technical fields.    The founding parties are planning to submit their proposals  to the executive council in the very near future. All the  countries that signed the agreement on founding this  scientific-technical center have pledged substantial sums in  U.S. dollars to help finance the center: the U.S.--10 million,  Sweden--1.5 million, and Canada--2 million dollars. Ukraine has  pledged to do everything necessary to prepare the center,  allocate a building and equipment, and provide services.</p>

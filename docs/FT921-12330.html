			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / Commission opposes move to trade airport landing slots AIRLINES SHOULD be allowed to buy and sell the rights to land at European airports, according to an advisory report prepared for the European Commission. Its suggestions conflict with the views of the Commission, which favours a more interventionist approach to prevent large airlines dominating airport landing slots. The way in which landing slots are allocated is a central part of proposals for EC airline liberalisation. It is of pressing importance because several European airports, including London's Heathrow, Frankfurt and Milan, cannot satisfy the demands of airlines wanting to land there. Such under-capacity shuts out newcomers to the industry. In the interests of competition, the UK government last year forced the transfer of slots from British Airways to a much smaller competitor, Virgin Atlantic, on the lucrative London-to-Tokyo route. So-called slot trading, as recommended in the report, could replace a system of allocations based on scheduling committees and biannual meetings of international carriers under the auspices of the International Air Transport Association (Iata). The report argues that slot trading at four of the busiest airports in the US 'has had a beneficial effect in securing a more efficient use of limited airport capacity'. It quotes airlines as saying that the system had helped them 'fine tune' their schedules, but adds that 'slot trading needs to be part of a strong pro-competition policy'. It recommends that independent brokers should be set up to trade slots. 'This would prevent the manipulation of the slots in an anti-competitive way,' said Mr David Starkie, author of the report, yesterday. 'An airline would not know who it was selling to and so would not be able to stop a sale to a particular operator.' His views have the support, in principle, of British Airways. 'The current procedure should be amended to allow airlines to buy and sell existing . . . slots,' says the airline. However Mr Bruno Julien of the EC's Transport Commission said: 'We do not favour such a system. The strongest would always be able to get the best slots. This would not help liberalisation of the market.' The EC wants, instead, to encourage airports to increase slot capacity and proposes that under-used slots are re-allocated to other airlines every six months. It is not alone in its scepticism about a free market in slots. US airport operators protest that slot trading might divert attention from other ways of dealing with under-capacity such as more efficient air traffic control. The cost of buying slots might also be passed on to passengers through higher fares. Proponents of a free market are also likely to face opposition from EC member states and companies. Last month, the UK parliamentary transport committee concluded that existing mechanisms were 'a workable, if imperfect method of allocating slots'. It said that changes would be evolutionary, suggesting that unused slots could be 'returned to the scheduling committee for reallocation'. 'The EC proposals have not yet been fully debated,' conceded the Transport Commission. Advocates for both sides are due to get their chance when the matter comes up for consideration by the Council of Ministers. This should happen before the end of the Portuguese presidency of the Commission in July, the Transport Commission said. *Slot Trading at United States Airports, a report for the Director General for Transport of the Commission of the European Communities.

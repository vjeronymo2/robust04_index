			<p><P> June 29, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CIF RULES 'RECRUITED' ATHLETES NOT ELIGIBLE AT CHRISTIAN  </P> <P> Christian High School has been placed on a one-year probation for recruiting  violations involving several of the county's top basketball players.  </P> <P> The probation handed down by Kendall Webb, CIF commissioner of the San Diego  Section, does not affect the private school's ability to compete but only rules  ineligible to play for Christian any student the school has "solicited directly  or by contact of his parents," according to a press release from Webb's office.  </P> <P> The ruling came after an investigation by Webb into complaints from coaches and  parents concerning a May 15 dinner attended by Ed Giles, Christian High  principal; Gary Jenkins, a school booster, and six top basketball prospects,  notably Valhalla's Tony Clark, who led the section in scoring last year with a  29.5-point average.  </P> <P> Others in attendance were Monte Vista center Joe McNaull, Crawford guard Tracy  Halton, Southwest center Adalberto Silva and University City forward-centers  Ray Hooper and Greg Ballard. All will be seniors next season except Hooper and  Ballard, who will be juniors.  </P> <P> That the dinner took place was the basis of Webb's decision.  </P> <P> "I found that there was recruiting activity and attempts to influence students  to attend Christian High," Webb said from Florida, where he is attending the  National Federation Conference. "Considering that any student who was present  or represented at the meeting would be ineligible if he transfered seems to be  appropriate action at this time. It also places Christian High School on alert  to evaluate the activity of people operating on their behalf."  </P> <P> After the dinner and before Webb's ruling, only Clark had announced an  intention to transfer to Christian. Clark could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> Giles, who was exonerated by Webb, said he went to the meeting under the  impression that several parents interested in having their children transfer to  Christian made arrangements for the dinner.  </P> <P> "I do PR for our private school," Giles said of the meeting. "I walked into it  thinking the parents had made first contact."  </P> <P> But Giles said he later learned that Jenkins, who serves on a committee that  aids students coming to Christian, had been talking to the parents.  </P> <P> Giles said Jenkins came into contact with the parents through Art Clark, Tony's  father, who is the coach of the San Diego Slam-N-Jam basketball team that  included the players invited to the dinner. Jenkins and Clark coach Little  League baseball together.  </P></p>

			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / LVMH surges 19% and sees strong growth LVMH, the French luxury goods group, yesterday announced net profits of FFr3.57bn (Pounds 400m) for 1993, a 19 per cent increase over the previous year, and forecast strong earnings growth this year. Mr Bernard Arnault, chairman, said encouraging developments had emerged since the final quarter of 1993. He cited economic recovery in the US and the UK, improved champagne sales, lower financial charges and a strengthening of the Japanese cognac market. The improvement was reflected in sales figures for the first two months which, he said, rose by 28 per cent compared with the same period in 1993. The group said net profits should rise by more than 20 per cent this year if the progress experienced in the past few months continued. The share price climbed by nearly 5 per cent to FFr4,389. Last year's profits were boosted by exceptional gains, largely resulting from the sale of the group's RoC cosmetics business. Without these FFr602m gains, the company would have recorded profits of FFr2.97bn, a slight fall on 1992 but still at the top end of expectations. Sales grew 10 per cent to FFr23.8bn. The performance of the cognac and champagne businesses contrasted with luggage and perfumes. Operating profits from cognac and spirits fell from FFr2.29bn to FFr1.91bn due to depressed demand, while champagne produced a flat contribution of FFr780m despite a 7 per cent rise in turnover. In luggage and leather goods, operating profits grew from FFr1.87bn to FFr2.32bn, while perfumes and beauty products advanced from FFr809m to FFr852m. Earnings growth this year is expected to be supported by reduced financial charges resulting from the reorganisation of its shareholdings with Guinness of the UK. The January reorganisation, in which Guinness swapped its indirect 24 per cent stake in LVMH for a direct stake in the French group's champagne activities, brought proceeds of about FFr11bn for LVMH. Industry observers expect LVMH to take full control of Guerlain, one of France's most famous fragrance houses in which it has a 15 per cent stake. A dividend of FFr15 per share, an increase of 10 per cent, is proposed. Lex, Page 20</p>

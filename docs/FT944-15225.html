			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / International Company News: Repola and Kymmene return to black - Finnish groups' results confirm this year's recovery in Nordic forestry industry Repola and Kymmene, two of Finland's big four forestry groups, yesterday reported large swings back to profit in the first eight months of the year after losses in the same period last year. The recovery followed sharply reduced financial charges. Both reported high capacity utilisation - 94 per cent in the case of Kymmene's paper mills - and said demand in Europe for forestry products and paper was likely to remain strong. The results were in line with resurgent profitability in the Nordic forestry industry this year. They covered a period during which Repola and Kymmene came close to agreeing a merger between Kymmene and United Paper Mills, the forestry group and main component of Repola. Talks broke down in June. Repola reported pre-tax profits in the first eight months of FM1.17bn (Dollars 252m), a turnround from a restated loss of FM119m in the same period last year. Repola and Kymmene restated 1993 figures to conform with European Union accounting principles. Turnover rose to FM18.36bn from FM17.77bn and operating profit grew to FM2.11bn from FM1.67bn. Financial expenses fell FM792m due to lower interest rates and a reduction in group debts. Operating profits at UPM rose to FM1.8bn from FM1.48bn on turnover up at FM12.56bn from FM11.74bn. Repola said the increase in turnover was due to marked growth in its paper and mechanical wood processing businesses. Repola's engineering division, Rauma, saw sales increase to FM5.18bn from FM5.03bn. But operating profits doubled to FM247m from FM124m. At Kymmene, there was a swing to a FM545m profit in the first eight months from a FM337m (restated) loss. Sales rose to FM12.11bn from FM10.98bn, thanks mainly to higher sales of fine papers, panels and sawn timber. Value of sales fell FM700m as the markka appreciated. Operating profit rose to FM1.32bn from FM944bn. Net financial charges tumbled to FM846m from FM1.2bn.</p>

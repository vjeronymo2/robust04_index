			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / Tehran's vendetta hits the Kurds hard: The war with the guerrillas is worsening, writes Gareth Smyth, recently in Baneh region, western Iran ASHAD Rashidi is 23, newly married and frightened. A shell recently exploded across the isolated, rocky valley in western Iran where he and his five brothers farm. The boom of artillery fire echoes almost daily around the area. 'I know of more than 20 people who have been killed,' he says. Within the mud-baked walls of his house hang pictures of President Hashemi Rafsanjani as well as Ayatollah Khameini, Iran's spiritual leader, and the late Ayatollah Khomeini. 'When the pasdaran (revolutionary guards) see these pictures, they will not harm us,' Mr Rashidi explains. The shelling is one sign of the intensifying conflict between Tehran's Islamic regime and the peshmerga guerrillas of the Kurdistan Democratic party of Iran (KDPI). Yet a news blackout operated by Iran ensures the trouble goes largely unreported in the outside world. It is a bitter, large-scale conflict. Iran is said to have stationed around 200,000 troops, mainly pasdaran, in its Kurdish region since Ayatollah Khomenei declared a jihad (holy war) against the mainly Sunni Kurds in 1980. The peshmerga claim the pasdaran have lost the will to fight. 'They used to hang pictures of the Ayatollah on their chests and wear headbands as a symbol of (the seventh century Shia martyr) Hussein, but only a few do that now,' said Mr Sa'ed Brayhim, KDPI commander for the Baneh region. Rather than engage in hand-to-hand fighting, the pasdaran, who have bases in all the local towns and many villages, resort to the imprecise use of artillery and mortars against peshmerga who move largely at night and receive food and moral support from Kurdish villagers. The hamlet of Bagy Kazy, some 20 miles south-west of Baneh, was abandoned by residents terrified of shelling, KDPI peshmerga claim. Recent signs of habitation (hay in cattle pens, abandoned pots) were testimony to the villagers' rapid departure. In escalating its campaign, the KDPI draws strength from bases across the border in northern Iraq made possible since the emergence in late 1991 on Iraqi soil of a 'free Kurdistan' with de facto independence from Baghdad. The government of 3m Iraqi Kurds, who elected their own unofficial 'parliament' last year, has fanned the nationalist aspirations of the estimated 5m-8m Iranian Kurds denied any autonomy and compelled to use the Farsi language on formal occasions, including in education. Relations between Tehran and the Iraqi Kurdish authorities have worsened throughout the year, and threaten a new twist to the complex politics of the region. Iran issues frequent warnings about the 'godless and morally corrupt situation' in Iraqi Kurdistan, and its troops held a security zone inside Kurdish Iraq between April and August, prompting protests from Baghdad. Among the Iranian bugbears is the Kurdish radio and TV now beamed into Iran from Iraqi Kurdistan and offering a mixture of news, views and music. One aged villager near Baneh, whose son was recently arrested for grazing his sheep too close to an Iranian military position, tunes in to the station: 'I don't like Tehran radio, I want a programme in my own language,' he says. Ordinary Kurds in the Baneh region say life is worse than under the Shah, overthrown by the Islamic Revolution in 1979. The poor state of the Iranian economy, with high inflation and unemployment after the devaluation of the rial in March, has hit the Kurdish regions hard, compounding the sense of discrimination in one of the poorest parts of Iran. The KDPI has a long-established policy of eschewing terrorism which has survived the assassination of its past two leaders, Mr Abdolrahman Qassemlou in Vienna in 1989 and Mr Sadiq Sherefkindi in Berlin last year. 'I want to talk to people with my tongue, not with my Kalashnikov,' says Mr Ali Azizi, a peshmarga commander. The KDPI moved its headquarters in August from Bollay to Koisanjaq, some 45 miles from the border and beyond the range of Iranian artillery. Casualty figures are hard to come by. Tehran says nothing. The KDPI is anxious to play down the importance of its bases inside Iraqi Kurdistan and insists its primary work in Iran is organisational rather than military. Mr Mustapha Hijri, KDPI general secretary, says 'more than 50' pasdaran have been killed since April, but a cursory listen to KDPI radio and conversations with peshmerga suggest the real figure is higher. Mr Hijri is convinced the struggle is tilting in the Kurds' favour. 'We will carry out more attacks. I believe we will win'. His fear is that the Iraqi Kurds, beleaguered by President Saddam Hussein and desperate for friends in the region, will yield to Tehran's pressure and insist the KDPI leave. 'I have not thought where we would go then,' he says.</p>

			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / Survey of Republic of Cyprus (8): Nibbling at the edges - Ecology and the environment THE entrance to the Avagas gorge, at the base of the Akamas peninsula in western Cyprus, used to look like an early traveller's engraving: a quiet pasture dotted with juniper and wild olive trees. But last month, the bulldozers moved in, churning up the ground for cultivation. The Akamas is a 155 sq km wilderness with an unusual variety of bird and plant life, some of it unique to Cyprus. There are sandy beaches where the rare green turtle lays its eggs, an aromatic pine forest and dramatic cliff walks. Increasingly, it is becoming a refuge from the concrete agglomerations of hotels and holiday apartments lining much of the coast. It has escaped development so far because of its remoteness. One area is used as a firing range by British forces from the two sovereign bases on the island. Until recently the only other visitors were hunters and botanists. But mass tourism has now spread to western Cyprus. Paphos, the resort closest to the peninsula, has an international airport. Land prices have rocketed, much to the relief of villagers who feared being left out of the property boom elsewhere on the island. Although the Akamas was declared a national park in 1989 in response to pressure from a vociferous local environmental movement, little has been done since them to ensure its protection. 'The park is being nibbled away at the edges, a banana grove here, a summer house there. In places like the Avagas gorge it doesn't take much to upset the ecological balance,' says Mr David Pearlman of Exalt, a Paphos travel agency that takes small groups to explore the Akamas. The government is under pressure from would-be developers with landholdings in the Akamas, among them the Orthodox church and some prominent Cypriot businessmen, to grant permits for building several luxury hotels. The environmentalist lobby wants existing zoning regulations to be more strictly enforced until legislation is prepared to protect the area and a park management plan approved. They also want the British military to stop using the Akamas for training with live ammunition. The environmentalists have found little support around Paphos. They are criticised by clergymen and threatened by villagers opposed to plans for agro-tourism projects, small-scale development in traditional surroundings, in a buffer zone at the edge of the park. However, the European Community is backing an agro-tourism scheme which has begun in a group of villages further inland which are unlikely to attract mass tourism. The Laona project was launched with an Ecu100,000 (Dollars 125,000) grant plus private sector contributions. Twenty old houses are being restored or converted for tourists looking for a taste of traditional village life. The success of a project to protect the green turtle, a threatened species, testifies to what can be achieved if the Akamas is properly looked after. Tourists are banned from Lara beach at night, the time when turtles crawl out of the sea, dig nests in the sand and lay clutches of eggs. After 15 years of surveillance during the summer nesting season and selective raising of hatchlings by a turtle monitoring group, the numbers have started to increase. 'More young females are coming back to lay at Lara. It's an encouraging sign,' says Mr Andreas Demetropoulos of the fisheries department. A park management study for the Akamas is to be carried out next year by the Mediterranean Technical Assistance Programme (Metap), which is supported by the UN and the World Wildlife Fund. Afterwards, Cyprus would be eligible for World Bank funding for implementing it. Environmentalists worry whether it will be possible to hold off the developers for a few more years.</p>

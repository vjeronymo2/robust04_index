			<p><P> May 12, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> D.A. SAYS SHOOTING BY POLICE IN AUTO-THEFT CASE WAS JUSTIFIED  </P> <P> The non-fatal shooting in December of an armed auto-theft suspect by a San  Diego police officer was ruled justified by the district attorney's office. The  decision was made public Friday by the San Diego Police Department.  </P> <P> The shooting of Javier Camacho came after he and his brother, Raul Camacho,  lead a San Diego police officer on a high-speed chase on southbound Interstate  5. National City police officer Mark Blaha and a Border Patrol agent later  joined a foot chase of Javier Camacho. It was during the foot chase that Javier  Camacho was shot once in the buttocks. Each of the three officers fired at  Javier Camacho, and each had a different type of gun. But, because the bullet  was not removed from Camacho's buttocks, the district attorney could not  determine which officer actually hit him.  </P> <P> According to a letter to San Diego Police Chief Bob Burgreen from Michael R.  Pent, deputy district attorney: On Dec. 7, the Camacho brothers were in a car  that had been stolen the night before when they were spotted by a San Diego  police officer on a downtown street. The men were chased by Police Officer  Enrique Jemmott when they entered the freeway.  </P> <P> During the chase, Raul Camacho fired about three shots at the Jemmott's car.  The car drove off the freeway and stopped at an embankment. Javier Camacho ran  from the car with a revolver in his hand. He was chased by the three officers.  When he reached a chain-link fence, he ducked behind a tree. The officers  opened fire and Javier Camacho was shot in the buttocks.  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 30, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ROSE BOWL NOTEBOOK;  </P> <P> IF USC CAN'T TRIPP HIM, IT MUST FIND A WAY TO STOP WELBORNE  </P> <P> Sullivan Anthony Welborne III, better known as Tripp, for triple, is one of the  nation's premier defensive backs.  </P> <P> Yet, the Michigan strong safety insists that basketball is his first love.  </P> <P> In fact, the ever-smiling, personable Welborne likes to tell the story about  being recruited by Bo Schembechler.  </P> <P> The Michigan coach watched Welborne play for his high school basketball team in  Greensboro, N.C.  </P> <P> "My heart belongs to Michigan, but basketball is my favorite sport. I used to  shoot a lot. No shot is a bad shot. If you're off, you got to shoot until  you're on. If you're on, you got to keep shooting because you're on," Welborne  reasoned.  </P> <P> After a non-stop shooting spree, Welborne recalled that Schembechler told him  he'd have to ice his elbow.  </P> <P> "I said, 'I always shoot like that.' He said, 'You shot it every time.' "  </P> <P> Now, Welborne, a junior All-American, is shooting down quarterbacks as  Michigan's designated blitzer.  </P> <P> In this year's 22-14 Rose Bowl victory over USC he made 10 tackles, intercepted  a pass and forced a fumble.  </P> <P> He was also prominent in his team's come-from-behind, 24-23 win over UCLA  earlier this season with a 63-yard punt return.  </P> <P> That was the turning-point game for Michigan, Welborne said, after a  season-opening loss to Notre Dame.  </P> <P> "We showed our character, showed we could come back, and I think UCLA played  the best game it played all year," Welborne said. "We didn't play our best  game, but to come out with a win showed that we hung together. We never thought  we were going to lose. It showed we can come back from adversity. The lesson  is, never quit."  </P> <P> The Rose Bowl game will showcase two of the nation's best defensive backs --  Welborne and USC's Mark Carrier, a finalist for the Jim Thorpe award.  </P> <P> Welborne and Carrier were roommates in a hotel during the taping of the Bob  Hope television show, featuring 1989 All-American players.  </P> <P> "We talked about everything," Welborne said. "We talked about the practices we  had. Our practices are so similar. He told us what they did, and I said,  'That's the same thing we do.' So it's going to be a battle of the titans,  everything is equal. The team with the fewest mistakes will win."  </P> <P> As for Carrier, Welborne said: "I've seen him on film, and he's a great, great  player who makes big plays when you need them."  </P> <P> Welborne has also been impressed by USC quarterback Todd Marinovich.  </P> <P> "It's not that he can't play the game because he's young. He can throw the ball  and do the things necessary to win. He has proved it during the season.  </P> <P> "So we have to go out and play as if he's a veteran, and in our minds, he is.  He is one of the toughest quarterbacks I've seen outside of our own (Michael  Taylor). He throws passes and gets hit in the chest, and he'll get right back  up. That's the mark of a true competitor."  </P> <P> "But, hopefully, he'll make some mistakes in the game and give us a break."  </P> <P> The ongoing theme of the 76th Rose Bowl game is Schembechler's retirement. He  said he's enjoying his last week of coaching and will be more cognizant of his  health when he retires  </P> <P> Schembechler had a heart attack before the 1970 Rose Bowl game with USC and has  had two bypass operations.  </P> <P> "I'm not into my new life yet," he said. "But as soon as this is over I'm going  to the treadmill, watch what I eat and lose weight. I figure this is my last  fling."  </P> <P> Schembechler has been accommodating and seemingly relaxed during news  conferences at his team's hotel in Newport Beach.  </P> <P> He didn't even get irritated when someone suggested that there would be a hole  in his career if he doesn't win a national championship.  </P> <P> "It's not a hole in my career, as far as I'm concerned," he said. "It may be  for other people. There's nothing I would have done any differently in my  coaching career. I won some games, won some (Big Ten) championships, made a lot  of friends, what the hell else do you want?"  </P> <P> Schembechler also discounts the emotional factor of his team trying to win one  final game for their coach. "We don't need that. We're playing in the Rose  Bowl. We don't need any added incentive."  </P> <P> Fritz Crisler was the last Michigan lame-duck coach to bring a team to the Rose  Bowl. The Wolverines responded, beating USC, 49-0, in 1948.  </P> <P> USC Coach Larry Smith is in favor of sudden-death overtime in college football  games as a tiebreaking procedure.  </P> <P> He doesn't believe that teams should battle for 60 minutes just to end up in a  tie.  </P> <P> Perhaps that season-ending 10-10 tie with UCLA is still frustrating.  </P> <P> Rose Bowl Notes  </P> <P> USC defensive tackle Dan Owens has started every game in his four years at the  school, and the Rose Bowl will be his 48th in a row. . . . Marinovich, who was  named freshman of the year by UPI and the Sporting News, is already seventh on  USC's career passing list.  </P></p>

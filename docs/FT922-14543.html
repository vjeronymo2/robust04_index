			<p>920406 FT  06 APR 92 / Brussels clears big audit firms of being anti-competitive LEADING international networks of accountancy firms have been cleared by a European Commission study of any suggestion of anti-competitive practices. The study, conducted by a London-based consultancy for the EC competition directorate, concludes that harmonisation of standards and mutual recognition of qualifications have 'some way to go' to remove the 'substantial barriers' restricting trade in audit and consulting services between EC member states. It warns that any further mergers between the six largest firms in Europe would demand 'close scrutiny'. It says anxieties about the independence of auditors are raised by their practice of providing other services, such as tax advice and management consultancy, to clients. The report, produced early last year and long awaited by the accountancy profession, was commissioned in 1989 to investigate whether the largest firms held monopoly power in the Community. The directorate said yesterday: 'Accountancy is not a perfect market but it is not presenting a burning problem to us and there are other priorities at the moment.' The news appears to damp fears that the EC might act to prevent mergers between the big firms, reduce their expansion across member states or bar them from providing additional services to their audit clients. Mr Dermot Glynn, managing director of National Economic Research Associates, which carried out the study, said: 'This is a clean-ish bill of health for the firms.' The study shows that the audits of large European companies are heavily dominated by the international networks of 'big six' firms, and argues that competitors are excluded because they have fewer resources and are perceived to offer lower quality. But it suggests these networks - a resource-sharing mechanism between different national firms - are limited by laws and professional restrictions which insulate accounting in each EC member state. The directorate appears to have no intention of breaking up the mergers which took place in the late 1980s and which reduced the number of very large firms from eight to six.

			<p><P> April 15, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> STUCKY, BRAHMS OCCUPY PHILHARMONIC WEEK  </P> <P> In the performed arts, substance and seriousness are not enough, as listeners  at the Thursday night subscription concert by the Los Angeles Philharmonic in  the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion of the Music Center found out, again.  </P> <P> With Debussy's languid but demanding "Prelude a l'apres-midi d'un faune" as the  curtain-raiser, two large-scale works -- contrasting concertos, actually --  dominated Andre Previn's latest Philharmonic program (repeated Friday night and  Sunday afternoon). Before intermission, the subscribers heard the local  premiere of Steven Stucky's recent Concerto for Orchestra; after, Brahms'  Second Piano Concerto, with Horacio Gutierrez the soloist.  </P> <P> Previn and Gutierrez appear to be sensitive and equal musical partners, and  their joint efforts on behalf of Brahms' massive B-flat Concerto proved  admirable in many ways. But this performance never caught fire.  </P> <P> Not surprisingly, the Cuban-born musician showed all the musical and technical  wherewithal for this challenge; his comprehensive technique easily encompassed  all the hurdles, complexities and knotty passages in the huge canvas. Yet, his  reading emerged uninspired, and lacked any compelling sense of motion.  </P> <P> Gutierrez certainly surveyed the lyric moments thoroughly and with loving  hands; a veteran listener felt he was hearing certain passages clearly for the  first time. And together, pianist and conductor, aided most carefully by the  orchestra, probed and caressed every little part of Brahms' big score.  </P> <P> But no amount of collegiality seemed able to get this performance off the  ground. It moved, if not slowly, then in stately dignity, from beginning to  end. And the lack of fire cannot be blamed on the composer.  </P> <P> Stucky's Concerto for Orchestra turned out to be colorful but undramatic,  short-seeming but actually 28 minutes in length. Something Oriental -- nothing  overt or analyzable -- flavors its three contrasting movements. In his  fascinating program note, the 39-year-old composer acknowledges that his method  of organizing this piece created compositional modules rather than a genuine  continuity. That is both the charm and the weakness of the piece.  </P> <P> Fascinating sounds from a number of inner orchestral ensembles keep the  listener engaged, and the piece ends before one's interest wanes. But any sense  of arrival, or of direction or climax, seems never to appear. At the final  plop, one feels only that the wandering is over -- not completed.  </P> <P> What makes the work a concerto is that it is showy, outgoing, concerned with  display, and that it exists, as the astrologists say, "above the horizon."  Also, it never rests, or seems to stop strutting its stuff. Tonality and  atonality co-habitate its space comfortably; Stucky's musical language emerges  attractive, if not always pretty, yet he is clearly capable of creating  feelings of Angst, frustration and conflict through purely tonal means.  </P> <P> The orchestra, under Previn's confident guidance, gave an interested and  thoroughgoing reading. Oddly, the Thursday night audience, which usually makes  up its mind quickly about a new work, responded only tepidly to this one.  </P> <P> Debussy's familiar Prelude opened the program appropriately, in a lush, rich  and immaculate rendering which showed the Philharmonic at its most balanced.  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by JINGJI RIBAO reporter Li Zhengping (2621 3630 </F> 1627): "Number of Domestic-Funded Enterprises Increasing Rapidly  -- a Trend Shown by Latest Statistics From State Administration  of Industry and Commerce"]    [Text] Even more eye-catching than the rapid increase of  the number of enterprises with foreign investments in the year  of 1993 which had just passed was the vigorous growth of various  types of domestic-funded enterprises in China. The latest  statistics compiled by the State Administration of Industry and  Commerce shows that as of the end of 1993, the number of  registered domestic-funded enterprises in China reached 7.287  million, an increase of 1.465 million over 1992. The number of  employees working for such enterprises in 1993 totaled 252.5  million, a growth of 40 million over 1992. The registered  capital of such enterprises in 1993 totaled 4,235.85 billion  yuan, a net increase of 1,456.28 billion yuan over 1992. This  was another year of rapid growth for various types of  enterprises after 1992.    According to an analysis conducted by authoritative sources,  domestic-funded enterprises showed the following characteristics  in their development during 1993:    -- The number of new enterprises continued to grow, while  the  number of enterprises which canceled their registration was also  on the rise. During 1993, the number of newly opened and  registered enterprises in China totaled 1.834 million, an  increase of 581,000 or 46.4 percent over 1992. Sichuan was the  province which witnessed the greatest number of such enterprises  -- 655,000. The number of such enterprises which canceled their  registration was on the rise since the sharp drop in 1992. The  number of such enterprises which canceled their registration  reached 341,000 in 1993, an increase of 83,000 or 32.2 percent  over 1992. Most of the enterprises which canceled their  registration were in the fields of industry, commerce, banking  and insurance. The increase in the number of enterprises which  canceled their registration reflected sharp market competition.    -- The rate of growth for enterprises under joint management  and those of other economic groupings remained high, while that  for collectively owned enterprises in various townships was  dropping. The rate of growth for state-owned and collectively  owned enterprises was not rapid. The rate of growth for  collectively owned township enterprises in 1993 dropped by 1.8  percent, while that for enterprises under joint management and  those of other economic groupings rose by 21 percent as compared  with 1992.    -- All three major industries grew in general with the  growth of the tertiary industry ahead of the other two. In the  tertiary industry, scientific research and overall technical  services saw the fastest growth of 84.9 percent. Growth in  transportation and communications, post and telecommunication,  banking and insurance was less remarkable.    -- As far as the ownership system is concerned, collectively  own companies, those in joint operations and those of other  economic groupings developed rapidly. The growth of state-owned  companies was relatively slow. The number of state-owned  companies totaled 383,000 in 1993, an increase of 78.1 percent  over 1992. The number of collectively owned companies totaled  602,000 and that of companies under joint operation and those of  other economic groupings totaled 54,000, marking increases of  139.8 percent and 157.6 percent respectively. If we view the  share of these companies in all enterprises, these companies  accounted for 19.6 percent of the total number of state-owned  enterprises. They accounted for 11.7 percent of the total number  of collectively owned enterprises, while they accounted for 30  percent of the total number of enterprises under joint operation  and those of other economic groupings.</p>

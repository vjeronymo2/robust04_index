			<p>920106 FT  06 JAN 92 / France to pull troops from Chad FRANCE is to withdraw its troops from Chad now that government forces have crushed a rebellion by troops loyal to deposed president Hissene Habre, foreign minister Roland Dumas said yesterday, Reuter reports from Paris. France sent 450 paratroopers to Chad from bases in France and nearby African states to boost its 1,200-man permanent garrison in Chad, and protect the 3,000 French nationals there, because of a rebel offensive against the capital N'Djamena last week. Saying the Chad government had the situation under control, Mr Dumas told Radio France-Info: 'The presence of the reinforcements we sent will no longer be justified if the situation is confirmed. It is a question of a few days or of a few weeks.' The Chad government said on Saturday its forces had crushed the rebellion by Habre forces, killing 425 rebels including six of his top aides. An official communique on state radio said government troops suffered 25 dead and 70 wounded in fierce fighting to recapture four garrison towns in the Lake Chad area west of N'Djamena.</p>

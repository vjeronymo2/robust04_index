			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / France's Socialist party asks election candidates to favour ecologists France's Socialist party has asked its election candidates to stand aside in favour of ecologists in individual constituencies if greens win more votes than them in the first round of the general election on Sunday, writes William Dawkins in Paris. The move is in line with former Socialist prime minister Michel Rocard's recent appeal for a 'big bang' in French politics, leading to a grouping of centre-left, human rights and ecology movements. Candidates winning more than half their constituencies' votes will be elected automatically on Sunday. But the rest go through to a simple majority run-off a week later, provided they win more than 12.5 per cent of the popular vote in the first round.</p>

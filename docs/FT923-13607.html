			<p>920713 FT  13 JUL 92 / UN escorts aid convoy into Dobrinja AID WORKERS escorted by UN armoured vehicles took a convoy of relief supplies to the most devastated area of Sarajevo yesterday for the first time since a 71-day siege of the district began, Reuter reports from Sarajevo. But elswehere in Bosnia-Hercegovina, Serb forces tightened a ring of steel around the eastern town of Gorazde, seized key roads in the northeast and fought fierce battles in the north and southwest. In a breakthrough for international relief efforts, 12 lorries flanked by eight white UN armoured vehicles delivered 120 tonnes of supplies in the Dobrinja district. To subdued applause from hungry residents who flocked onto the streets, they unloaded the food and other supplies at two distribution centres before a three-hour local truce ran out and sniper fire resumed. 'This is what the United Nations and the UNHCR (the UN High Commissioner for Refugees) has been aiming for after getting aid to more accessible places,' said Mr Peter Kessler, spokesman for UNHCR in Sarajevo. 'There has been very heavy fighting, shooting and shelling there all the time. People there have been living on grass - ordinary grass,' he said. Over 7,500 people have been killed in Bosnia since the Serbs rose up against independence from Yugoslavia and won control of more than 60 per cent of Bosnian territory from the majority Moslems and Croats. The UNHCR estimates 380,000 people are trapped in Sarajevo with little food, water or power. More than 1,000 tonnes of aid have been flown to the capital by an international airlift but hardly any had reached Dobrinja and other embattled districts. Dobrinja, a community of apartment blocks used as the media village in the Sarajevo Winter Olympics in 1984, bore the marks of a 71-day siege by Serb irregular forces. From 30,000 to 45,000 people are estimated to be trapped there. 'Seventy people have been killed in the siege here and 1,500 have been wounded,' a doctor at a makeshift hospital told reporters who visited Dobrinja with the convoy. Street battles broke out in Gorazde at the weekend and people were trapped with little food. Amputations and other surgery were being carried out without anaesthetic, according to amateur radio operators.</p>

			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Breaking down Euro-barriers - Diane Summers looks at a Brussels questionnaire on advertising Any day now, thousands of businesses across Europe will be receiving a fat envelope containing a questionnaire from the European Commission on 'commercial communications'. The combination of the words 'Commission' and 'questionnaire' on the missive would probably be enough on their own to make some people reach for the waste paper basket. Compounding matters is the unfamiliar notion of 'commercial communications'. In rough translation, this means advertising, but also includes sales promotion and direct marketing material, as well as aspects of packaging and labelling. The Commission is trying to find out what barriers would prevent a company conducting, for example, a pan-European press advertising campaign or marketing its products in another member state. In the UK, the Advertising Association would see the French Loi Evin, which placed severe restrictions on alcohol advertising from January 1993, as the latest example of such a barrier. The survey is also intended to help Brussels to get a grip on its policy making and establish a single point of contact on marketing issues. Currently, proposals affecting advertising and marketing spring from every directorate and there is a widespread view that these areas have largely been forgotten in the discussion about completion of the internal market. The association has compiled a list of such draft legislation currently on the books. It includes: a proposal for a total ban on tobacco advertising throughout the EU (stalled at the final stages); draft rules on 'distance selling' through direct response advertisements and mail order (in a council working group and awaiting a second reading by the European Parliament); proposals on comparative advertising (awaiting Commission redraft); and rules on claims in food advertising (awaiting a Commission proposal). To file the Euro-questionnaire in the bin too hastily would be a mistake, according to Lionel Stanbrook, the association's expert on Europe. In his view, the Commission is providing a 'make or break chance' for businesses to press for freedom to advertise their goods and services across member states. The questionnaire is the start of a year-long consultation by the Commission on advertising and the European internal market, intended to lead to the publication of a green paper later this year and the formulation of a policy during 1995. This policy, says Stanbrook, 'could mean heavy restrictive legislation; it could mean a green light for effective self-regulation; it might mean a confirmation of the status quo'. If the Commission receives powerful evidence from respondents of the questionnaire that the single market in commercial communications is not working, Stanbrook even believes it could 'propose a European deregulation initiative of spectacular consequences'. He believes the questionnaire forms part of a 'genuine consultation with a genuinely uncertain outcome' and that the Commission officials concerned 'have a good knowledge of the economic importance of marketing communications in a free market'. At the same time, however, he acknowledges that the Commission is not starting from a clean sheet and Maastricht Treaty amendments bring two further elements to the discussion: subsidiarity, and an obligation to establish as a priority a high level of consumer protection throughout the EU. It is here, he fears, that the genuinely free market in communications could come unstuck. Stanbrook says: 'The Commission itself is starting to include 'minimal clauses' in draft legislation on consumer protection, allowing member states to set higher standards and rules than those set out in the draft legislation. This trend is unlikely to establish a single market without internal barriers. In this sense, subsidiarity could prove to be the fatal catch-all excuse for the maintenance of national trade protection'.</p>

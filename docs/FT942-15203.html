			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / Ashdown urges free information on uses of taxation Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, yesterday called for full hypothecation, or earmarking, of tax revenues to help overcome public distrust of politicians. Delivering the Williamson memorial lecture at Stirling University, Mr Ashdown said that only a 'fundamental change' in the way politics was conducted could restore public trust in government. 'Finding ways to recreate a sense of value for taxation must be a central element in rebuilding confidence in, and reconnecting people with, the political process,' he said. 'There is no reason why the government, on its tax demands, should not follow the directive it has given to town halls to set out where individual taxpayers' money goes. 'Then we could go further, with public spending generally aspiring to the clarity and symmetry of a road toll  - a specific charge levied to maintain a specific facility.' Mr Ashdown said the aim should be 'that taxpayers see themselves as the nation's shareholders  - required to come to a consensus decision, not on how much money to contribute to a pool from which random sums are later drawn, but on whether to set aside particular sums for clearly defined purposes'. Mr Ashdown's comments represent the clearest commitment by any of the main political parties to hypothecation. They also mark a significant advance on the Liberal Democrats 1992 general election manifesto, which limited the party's commitment to earmarking to education spending. The government remains strongly opposed to hypothecation, mainly because of strong opposition from the Treasury, which fears that earmarking would reduce the flexibility of economic policy and make public spending cuts harder to achieve. Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, has indicated sympathy for limited hypothecation, but the Labour party is unlikely to commit itself before the conclusion of its policy reviews.</p>

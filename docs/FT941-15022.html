			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / Government takes over Banco Latino: Big losses feared at Venezuelan bank The Venezuelan government yesterday appointed Mr Roger Urbina, the superintendent of banks, to take full control of the failed Banco Latino, the country's second largest commercial bank. The announcement followed a government decision late on Sunday night to intervene in the troubled institution, an official admission of the bank's failure. Banco Latino was suspended from the national cheque clearing system by the central bank last Thursday. The superintendent and a new government-appointed board will take full control of the bank, carry out a 90-day study of its financial situation, and later try to sell it, Mr Urbina said. This means the cash-strapped government, which has provided financial support for the bank since last month, will have to pour more money into the institution to pay off depositors and try to meet other obligations. Mr Urbina said the bank, which did not open for business on Friday, would re-open next week and would give priority to claims by holders of small savings accounts (the equivalent of Dollars 9,345 or less). There are no public estimates by officials on how high the bank's losses in Venezuela could go, but they are expected to be substantial and could have a serious impact on other banks. Aside from affecting tens of thousands of individual account-holders, the bank's failure has hurt a wide range of businesses, including private corporations, part of the national oil company and other government-owned concerns. According to banking sources, Latino may also have considerable assets at its offshore bank in Curacao. The government delayed its decision to take over Latino while it took an initial look at the books and discussed different options with the bank's main stockholders and representatives of other big commercial banks. It rejected options such as leaving the bank in the hands of its former owners and establishing a pool of funds from other commercial banks to re-float the institution. Government officials also said they were looking into possible criminal violations by Banco Latino's board members.</p>

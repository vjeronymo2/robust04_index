			<p><P> March 18, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> INCONSISTENT NORTHRIDGE SWEPT IN VOLLEYBALL MATCH  </P> <P> The Cal State Northridge men's volleyball team has been struggling to find the  winning combination.  </P> <P> Friday night at the CSUN gym it was more of the same. The Matadors played well,  but not well enough, and were swept by Long Beach State, 15-11, 15-8, 17-15, in  a Western Intercollegiate Volleyball Assn. match.  </P> <P> Fifth-ranked Long Beach State (16-5, 7-4 in conference play) sailed through the  first game, helped by CSUN's eight service faults.  </P> <P> The 49ers also controlled the second game before CSUN awoke to make a match of  it in the final game.  </P> <P> Setter Tom Ribarich paced the Matadors (7-15, 2-11) with 47 assists and 15  digs. Outside hitter Bob Samuelson added 22 kills and three assists and Neil  Coffman had 17 kills. PAUL OLSON  </P></p>

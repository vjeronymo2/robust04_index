Located in east China's Jiangsu Province, which faces the  newly-rising Pudong area zone in Shanghai, Lusi received 50  groups of foreign investors last year.    After feasibility studies, Chinese and foreign experts  agreed  that the port is a natural link on the marine lines from Dalian  in the northeast to Ningbo in the east and to Hong Kong in the  south.    It is suitable for building at least 100 berths to  accommodate ships of 10,000-dwt and 20 deepwater berths for  100,000-dwt ships.    The port is listed in the national port planning and  construction program, and will be developed into an  international port soon.</p>

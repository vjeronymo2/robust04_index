			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Great Feats of WPK in Achieving its Steel-like Unity and </F> Cohesion" -- KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, June 11 (KCNA) -- The 30 years since the  dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il assumed leadership over the  party work is a brilliant history of an illustrious leader who  has performed immortal feats in the efforts to increase the  might of the singlehearted unity of the Workers' Party of Korea  [WPK] in every way, says NODONG SINMUN in a signed article today  on the lapse of 30 years since the dear leader began to lead the  party.    It quotes the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il as saying:    "Our party achieved solid unity and cohesion a long time  ago.  Not resting content with this, however, it has continued to work  hard to strengthen the single-hearted unity of the whole party  around the leader, so that it maintains unbreakable unity and  cohesion, without any vacillation even in the present complex  situation."    Referring to immortal feats performed by the dear leader in  the struggle to strengthen the unity and cohesion of the WPK in  every way, the article notes:    Of primary importance in his great leadership feats is that  he has made it possible to firmly defend the tradition of the  proud singlehearted unity and glorify it through generations.    From the first days of his leadership over the chuche cause  of building the party he has subordinated all the party work and  activities entirely to the work for firmly defending and  exalting the tradition of singlehearted unity established by the  great leader Comrade Kim Il-song when he started the Korean  revolution.    Today when many parties of the world which had boasted of  their long history have collapsed, not defending the tradition  of unity, the WPK is firmly defending the tradition of  singlehearted unity established in the initial period of the  revolution. Herein lies the distinguished greatness and wise  leadership of the dear leader.    What holds an important place in his great leadership feats  is that he put forward the slogan of modelling the whole party  on the chuche idea and has victoriously organized and led the  struggle for its realisation, thus turning the WPK into an  unbreakable integrated whole of one ideology and purpose. Thus,  the organisational and ideological might of the WPK has  increased immensely and a new change has taken place in the  ideological and moral traits of the party members.    Today the entire party members think and act in accordance  with the party's ideology and purpose at any time and in any  place with the firm stand and view that they know nothing but  the chuche idea, the revolutionary idea of the party.    What holds a brilliant place in his immortal leadership  feats  is also that he has made the whole party an entity of loyalty  and filial piety, which is pervaded by unfailing loyalty to the  party and the leader, with his great benevolent politics.    Regarding the idea of "believing in the people as in heaven"  as his maxim from his early years, he always firmly believes in  his revolutionary soldiers and people and spares nothing for  them.    What holds a brilliant place also in his great leadership  feats is that he has made sure that the work for strengthening  the unity and cohesion of the party was conducted in close  combination with the struggle to effect a great upswing in all  domains of the revolution and construction and, thus, its  indestructible vitality was demonstrated powerfully in practice.    In particular, the dear leader has seen to it that the whole  party and the entire people vigorously conducted mass movements.  This is a great contribution made by him to further  strengthening the might of unity and cohesion of the party and  effecting revolutionary changes in socialist construction.    The immortal feats of the dear leader who has exalted the  might of singlehearted unity of the WPK on the highest level  with his extraordinary intelligence, tested leadership and  popular politics of warm love and trust in only 30 years which  can be regarded a moment in the long history of the  revolutionary movement, will shine forever with the victorious  advance of the Korean-style socialism.</p>

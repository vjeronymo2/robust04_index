			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / Investor watchdog to enlarge board THE FORMATION committee of the Personal Investment Authority, the proposed watchdog for retail financial services, is expected to accept in a consultative document published tomorrow that it has no means of forcing companies to be regulated by it. The new authority is designed to replace Lautro - the self-regulatory body for life assurance and unit trusts - as well as Fimbra - the regulator for financial advisers - and the retail operations of Imro, the fund managers' regulator. But the formation committee, headed by Sir Brian Hayes, has come under increasing pressure from the big four high street banks and insurance companies. Their absence from the new body would undermine the objective of creating a one-stop watchdog for retail financial services. The committee's main attempt to meet those objections will be to increase the size of the board so that it can include more bank and life-company members. The organisation's board will now have 30 seats rather than 25 as originally proposed. If the latest proposals are accepted, product providers will hold a total of 12 seats on the board, consisting of seven life offices, three unit trust and investment management companies, one bank and one friendly society. The remaining seats will be filled by 12 independent financial advisers, 10 consumer representatives and one independent chairman appointed from outside the industry. The planned timetable for the new regulatory body will include completion of the consultation process by late autumn, publication of firm proposals in January next year and a launch in July.</p>

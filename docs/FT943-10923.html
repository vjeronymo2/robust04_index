			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / International Bonds: GrandMet launches further Dollars 200m issue The traditional August lull, exaggerated by a holiday in Switzerland, started yesterday, with only a few new issues launched in a generally subdued market. Grand Metropolitan, the UK food and drinks group, added a Dollars 200m tranche to its Dollars 400m offering of five-year bonds launched in May. The proceeds of the new issue will be used to repay existing short-term debt, consisting mainly of commercial paper. 'We wanted to strengthen our balance sheet by further pushing out the maturity profile of our debt,' according to a GrandMet treasury official. The Dollars 400m deal launched in May, the company's debut in the eurodollar bond market, was also designed to improve the group's name recognition among European bond investors. GrandMet had previous launched several Yankee bonds in the US market. The Dollars 400m issue of eurobonds launched in May at a yield spread of 53 basis points over the comparable Treasury had tightened to around 50 basis points, where the new tranche was priced. Lead manager Lehman Brothers reported a mixture of retail and institutional placement. In Asia's dragon bond market, the Republic of Argentina launched a Dollars 100m three-year issue of floating-rate notes, arranged by Lehman Brothers and JP Morgan. The notes were priced to offer a discounted margin of 190 basis points over Libor. The deal, promoted by a roadshow, was designed to gain access for the borrower to new accounts in Asia. However, most central banks do not have approval to buy sub-investment grade bonds. The US Commodity Futures Trading Commission has approved the FT-SE Mid 250 index futures contract traded on the London International Financial Futures &amp; Options Exchange for sale to US customers. The contract has traded an average daily volume of 200 contracts since its introduction in February.</p>

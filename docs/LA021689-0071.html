			<p><P> February 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: PASADENA;  </P> <P> MALL ORDERED TO EASE RULES  </P> <P> A Los Angeles Superior Court judge has declared her intention to issue a  preliminary injunction requiring Plaza Pasadena to ease restrictions on  political activities in the mall.  </P> <P> Judge Miriam Vogel agreed with several objections to Plaza Pasadena rules  raised by attorney Dale Gronemeier, who represents the Democratic Party of the  San Gabriel Valley and a citizens group that campaigned in 1986 for a special  election in Pasadena to establish a strong-mayor form of government. The  Democrats and the citizens group claim they were illegally restricted from  circulating petitions and conducting political activities in the mall.  </P> <P> The case, which began three years ago, has produced a series of court decisions  that have upheld some restrictions on political activities and have struck down  others.  </P> <P> Last week, attorneys for the plaintiffs and for the Hahn Co., which operates  the mall, returned to court to argue over the mall's latest rules on political  activities. Vogel said some of Plaza Pasadena's new regulations were too  restrictive. For example, although Plaza Pasadena might be justified in banning  political activities during some shopping periods, she said, a ban from  Thanksgiving to New Year's Day is not justified.  </P> <P> Vogel instructed Gronemeier to prepare a preliminary injunction based on her  rulings. Attorney Thomas Leanse, who represents the Hahn Co., said he cannot  advise his client whether to appeal the decision until the preliminary  injunction is written and issued. In the meantime, he said, Plaza Pasadena will  continue to enforce its existing rules. In addition to ruling against Plaza  Pasadena on most of the contested regulations, Vogel ordered the Hahn Co. to  pay Gronemeier's law firm $110,000 as an interim award for legal work on the  case.  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 2, 1989, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: RAIL RIGHT OF WAY MAY BE SOLD  </P> <P> Southern Pacific Transportation Co. has confirmed that it is negotiating to  sell the former railroad right-of-way that runs for 14 blocks along Normandie  Avenue in the Harbor Gateway area.  </P> <P> A spokesman for the San Francisco-based company, Gerald Pera, said the  discussions began "very recently" and it is "much too early" to name the  potential buyer or disclose a possible sale price.  </P> <P> The narrow strip of land runs from Torrance Avenue to 223rd Street and has been  vacant since it was discontinued as a train route in 1982. Zoning would permit  single-family housing, light manufacturing or commercial development.  </P> <P> Several residents say motorcyclists occasionally use the strip for a raceway,  though Harbor Division police report that it receives few complaints about  problems there.  </P> <P> Harbor Gateway community activist Rochelle Bollock said Wednesday that she  plans to call a meeting of residents who will urge the city to buy the land for  a park. Niki Tennant, aide to Councilwoman Joan Mike Flores, who represents the  Harbor Gateway area, says the office has received no comments on the strip in  at least 18 months.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] There is grumbling within the National Front for  Change and Democracy [FNCD] following the decision to  temporarily suspend the National Congress of Democratic  Movements [CONACOM] from the FNCD. Senator Turneb explains that  this suspension was decided in an assembly. Interviewed by our  colleague Leontes [Dorzilme], Delpe recalled that it is a  temporary suspension, not an expulsion. Let us listen to the  report of Dorzilme's report:    [Begin Dorzilme recording, in Creole] The pot of division is  boiling within the FNCD following the front's latest decision  temporarily suspending CONACOM. However, if we are to believe a  note dated 10 May, many FNCD member parties say there is no  breakup within the FNCD, and that the decision that the member  organizations made as regards CONACOM is only an administrative  one.    This matter developed on 13 May, when we received a note  signed by Jude Marie Jacinthe, Isaac Garcon, and Mitrany Victor  as officials of the FNCD parliamentary bloc within the Chamber  of Deputies. Those people asked that [FNCD spokesmen] Evans Paul  and Turneb Delpe go back on their decision [temporarily  suspending CONACOM from FNCD] within 48 hours. They threatened  to no longer recognize the spokesmen if they failed to do so.    The resolution suspending CONACOM from FNCD was voted by a  minority, according to the note from Jude Marie Jacinthe, who  shares a position with Dunois Eric Cantave, the person in charge  of political affairs within CONACOM.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Fukuoka, March 1 KYODO -- The Fukuoka prefectural  office of the Food Agency has halted consignments of its entire  stock of imported Chinese rice after a Fukuoka rice wholesaler  reported finding some of it was discolored, officials said  Tuesday [1 March].    The officials said they had stopped distribution of the rice  because they have not yet finished inspecting it.    As a result, wholesalers in the area have suffered a  shortage  of Chinese rice to include in a special standard-priced blend  that was to be made available Tuesday.    Some wholesalers have begun including the higher-priced  United States rice in the blend, bearing the additional cost  themselves.    The Chinese rice was imported in January and forms part of  the 700 tons allotted to Fukuoka Prefecture in western Japan.  The discoloring was found in mid-February.    The standard-priced rice in Fukuoka was to have contained 60  percent U.S. rice, 20 percent Chinese rice and 20 percent Thai  rice, and sell at 3,191 yen per 10 kilograms.</p>

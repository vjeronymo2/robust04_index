RCRA section 4005(c)(1)(C) requires the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to determine whether States have adequate ``permit'' programs for MSWLFs, but does not mandate issuance of a rule for such determinations. EPA has drafted and is in the process of proposing a State/Tribal Implementation Rule (STIR) that will provide procedures by which EPA will approve, or partially approve, State/Tribal landfill permit programs. The Agency intends to approve adequate State/Tribal MSWLF permit programs as applications are submitted. Thus, these approvals are not dependent on final promulgation of the STIR. Prior to promulgation of the STIR, adequacy determinations will be made based on the statutory authorities and requirements. In addition, States/Tribes may use the draft STIR as an aid in interpreting these requirements. The Agency believes that early approvals have an important benefit. Approved State/Tribal permit programs provide for interaction between the State/Tribe and the owner/operator regarding site-specific permit conditions. Only those owners/operators located in States/Tribes with approved permit programs can use the site-specific flexibility provided by part 258 to the extent the State/Tribal permit program allows such flexibility. EPA notes that regardless of the approval status of a State/Tribe and the permit status of any facility, the federal landfill criteria will apply to all permitted and unpermitted MSWLF facilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Florida has applied for a determination of adequacy under section 4005 of RCRA. EPA Region IV has reviewed Florida's MSWLF application and has made a tentative determination that Florida's MSWLF permit program meets the requirements for full program approval and ensures compliance with the revised MSWLF Criteria (40 CFR part 258).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Florida's application for program adequacy determination is available from EPA Region IV and the State for public review and comment. Although, RCRA does not require EPA to hold a public hearing on a determination to approve a State's/Tribe's MSWLF program, Region IV has scheduled a public hearing on this determination. The date, location and time of the hearing is discussed below in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> DATES <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  section.

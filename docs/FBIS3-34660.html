			<p>Language: <F P=105>Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Palestinian People's Party [PPP], formerly the  Communist Party in the territories, announced tonight that it is  rejecting the Cairo agreement and is demanding that the PLO  Executive Committee be convened to reject the agreements reached  by Peres and 'Arafat. Ghassan al-Khatib, one of the party  leaders, told our correspondent Linda Sherzer that he did not  believe 'Arafat would be able to muster a majority for the  agreement in the Executive Committee.    The PPP contends that the Cairo agreement is based on the  Israeli demands, and the arrangements stipulated in it are  liable to last long after the interim period. The party, which  supported the Oslo agreement, is particularly opposed to the  arrangements at the border terminals and the security roads  leading to the Gaza Strip settlements.</p>

			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / Arts: Hollow laughter - Television Anyone who has ever worked for The Times or Punch has had to grow used to the comment 'Ah, yes, a great institution, but not what it was, of course'. The same is often said of British television comedy and the right response is the one that was first coined for The Times as long ago as the 19th century: 'True, but then it never was'. The thought is prompted by the appearance of two new situation comedies  - Side By Side and Don't Tell Father  - in a week that also brought repeat episodes of George And The Dragon (1966), Please Sir] (1968) and On The Buses (1970). Those last three date from the period which is often identified as the golden age of British television comedy, but this seems to owe more to rose tinted spectacles than to reality. There are probably three reasons for the period's inflated reputation. First, at almost all times there has been one outstanding comedy on British television (Blackadder Goes Forth, Fawlty Towers, The Good Life, Dad's Army and so on) but during the 1960s there were two: Steptoe And Son and Till Death Us Do Part, and somehow two seemed much more than twice as many as one. Secondly, there was much less television in those days and far fewer sitcoms around, a dozen perhaps. Two as a proportion of 12 is much more impressive than two would be today as a proportion of 40 or 50. Thirdly, both series were sold under format deals to the Americans and became highly successful in the US. This more than anything has caused those in the industry to shake their heads ruefully and tell stories to newcomers of what it was like in the good old days when British comedy was top. Yet judging from George And The Dragon, Please Sir] and On The Buses they must have felt like the bad old days much of the time to any moderately intelligent viewer. In George And The Dragon Sid James played a butler (old fashioned, surely, even 30 years ago) and Peggy Mount a housekeeper, working for an old buffer played by John le Mesurier. Unfortunately he appeared very little in the episode shown in the penultimate edition of Channel 4's fascinating TV Heaven season, and the dialogue and business between James and Mount was dire. She said things like 'Would you like to see my credentials?' at which he did a slow double-take and said 'Eh?' before asking ''Ow are yer dumplings?' All this was inundated, of course, with gallons of canned laughter. The long, slow pilot episode of Please Sir] shown in the ultimate edition of TV Heaven was, if anything, even worse, with a boyish John Alderton as the newly arrived naive school teacher being asked 'Hedges, what would you say to tapioca four times on the trot?' and mispronouncing the name of his Greek pupil. At least On The Buses had a bit of physical farce with Stan (Reg Varney) trying to sell an old motorcycle combination to Stephen Lewis's bus inspector and getting him jammed inside the sidecar. Yet this served chiefly as a reminder of the memorable Harpo/Groucho sidecar sequence which was so much funnier. The lines in On The Buses were as feeble as those in the other two. When Stan drafts a small ad for Arthur to sell the motorbike and writes 'Must sell, owner going abroad' Arthur says 'But I'm not going abroad' to which the punchline is 'If you sell this you might have to'. No self-respecting American comedy producer would accept such a puny gag, but in Britain it is shoved in and garnished with the usual dollop of artificial laughter in the hope of making us think it is funny. So if it was not such a golden age, if the small quantity of truly funny sitcoms was even at that period outweighed by a much larger amount of dull dross, are we perhaps more fortunate today than we realise, given that there are now so many more comedies on offer? The answer, surely, is no. However many we may have to choose from, the standard is uniformly low and, what is worse, there is now not even one series which is generally recognised as being outstanding. Some would argue that Drop The Dead Donkey should be allowed into the pantheon, and I would go some way towards agreeing, but  - having recently watched the repeat series  - would need to see more evidence of staying power before being sure. At least this series has the sort of joke frequency which we expect from the Americans, and jokes and character development go hand in hand as in Cheers and The Golden Girls. It is a little early to be certain, but it does not look as though it will be possible to say the same of either Don't Tell Father (Sundays BBC1) or Side By Side (Mondays BBC1). After watching these it scarcely seems any wonder that the rest of the world continues to believe  - despite the rigid pecking order in Arab states, despite the position of blacks in the US, despite the caste system in India  - that class consciousness is somehow peculiarly English. Both series seem obsessed with the minutiae of class distinction. The title Side By Side is a reference to the semi-detached proximity of middle class Gilly Bell who went to art school, drives a scarlet Citroen 2CV, and has been condemned to genteel poverty by widowhood, and Vince Tulley, a cockney plumber with loadsamoney but no taste who wants to build an extension, my dear, with Greek columns. Script sample: 'I sat at Swami Boojar's feet for five years'  - 'That must have been uncomfortable'  - riotous canned laughter. Don't Tell Father, which stars Tony Britton as a rich thespian paterfamilias on his fifth wife (Susan Hampshire, who gets few lines, but the same bit of business each week where she drags on a cigarette and then frantically sprays mouth and room with breath freshener) inhabits an even more old-fashioned world not far removed from that of Lord Snooty And His Pals. In tones which recall Dame Edith Evans saying 'A handbag?' Britton has to say things such as 'How is it going to look if my daughter marries a manipulator of motor vehicles?' The central idea of the grand actor is based upon popular assumptions which were going out of date at about the time Donald Wolfit was moving up from juvenile leads, and although the plot has so far concentrated on the desire of the fat daughter to marry a driving instructor called Marvin Whipple (canned laughter) instead of a member of the county set, there is on the reserve bench a Marxist-Leninist daughter (black leather, blonde and gorgeous) who talks only of the downtrodden workers, and a hippy son who is forever tripping out and practising transcendental meditation. Perhaps Roy Clarke delivered the script in 1962 and the BBC has only just found it. At this juncture, if I were in charge of situation comedy for a British television company, I would continue with the traditional British 'fragile genius' system: high quality comedy from fragile geniuses left alone in their garrets (or later their penthouses) to produce polished masterpieces in glorious isolation, a fact established for all time by Fawlty Towers  - just so long as they proved they were geniuses. Otherwise I would start experimenting with the American joke-or-door team system: more jokes in the places I say or you leave by that door. Something certainly needs to be done if British television comedy is to avoid going the way of Punch (hollow canned laughter).</p>

			<p><P> March 4, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAPAN REPORTEDLY WON'T FINANCE CONTROVERSIAL AMAZON PROJECT  </P> <P> Japan will not fund construction of the final segment of a controversial  highway through the Amazon rain forest in Brazil, according to a senior  Republican senator.  </P> <P> Sen. Bob Kasten of Wisconsin said Japan's ambassador to the United States,  Nobuo Matsunaga, "assured me the Japanese are not considering any proposal to  fund this highway."  </P> <P> Many environmentalists oppose the project, known as BR-364, because they fear  it will hurt the rain forest. It would link remote regions of the jungle in  Peru and Brazil to bustling Pacific ports on the other side of the Andes,  permitting raw materials such as lumber from the forest to be easily shipped  abroad.  </P> <P> </P> <P> U.S. Pressure Cited  </P> <P> Kasten said he believes that pressure from the United States helped persuade  Japan not to fund the road.  </P> <P> "I assured them that we will watch this project very closely because we intend  to ensure that basic environmental safeguards are followed if an arrangement  between the Brazilians and the Japanese develops," Kasten added in a statement  released Thursday.  </P> <P> Kasten is senior Republican on the Foreign Operations subcommittee, which has  jurisdiction over U.S. funds to multilateral development banks. He said Japan,  as a leading source of development funds, has a responsibility to make sure  that projects are environmentally safe.  </P> <P> On Feb. 3, a team of senators pledged to try to block the jungle road after  spotting evidence of it while touring the Amazon basin. They said construction  equipment was already in place, awaiting the end of the rainy season in April.  </P> <P> The huge Amazon rain forest is regarded as vital to the global environment.  Scientists have warned that its destruction could deprive the world of an  important source of oxygen and alter its weather patterns. Plants release  oxygen during photosynthesis.  </P></p>

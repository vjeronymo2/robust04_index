			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / International Company News: Shaky debut for Nasdaq International THE DEBUT of Nasdaq International, the early-morning market for US-listed stocks run by the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD), got off to a shaky start yesterday when two US broking firms withdrew from making markets in New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks because of regulatory restrictions on short sales. First Boston and Castle Securities had planned to make markets in 17 leading NYSE stocks - including IBM and AT&amp;T - during the system's first early-morning session of 3.30am to 9.30am New York time. The two firms pulled out at the last minute, however, when they realised that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had not changed its ruling banning short sales of Big Board stocks that did not trade above their prior-day NYSE closing price. Short selling is a standard trading strategy which involves dealers or investors selling borrowed stock in the hope of profiting from a fall in the stock by buying it back later at a lower price. Dealing firms are uncomfortable with the SEC's strict ruling on short selling of NYSE stocks on Nasdaq International because they regularly use short sales as a hedge against a falling market. The two firms, however, did join a handful of other London and New York dealers in making markets in over-the-counter stocks on Nasdaq International. When the session closed, 106,000 shares had changed hands, a figure which did not disappoint NASD officials, who had expected a light trading start.</p>

			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Hill Samuel to halve stake in Macquarie Bank HILL SAMUEL the UK mer-chant bank owned by TSB Group, will halve its stake in Macquarie Bank, the Australian financial services group, to 15 per cent in a deal worth almost ADollars 53m (Pounds 24m). The sell down, in line with an undertaking to the Australian government in 1985 when Macquarie was granted a banking licence, would involve 16.3m shares at ADollars 3.25 each. Macquarie plans to buy back 7.7m of the shares with the remaining 8.6m going to Australian institutions. The proposal is subject to approval by Macquarie shareholders but has already been given the go-ahead by the Reserve Bank. Macquarie said Hill Samuel had confirmed its intention to retain a 15 per cent shareholding 'for the foreseeable future subject to price.' A Hill Samuel representative will join the Macquarie board.</p>

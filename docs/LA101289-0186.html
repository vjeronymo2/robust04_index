			<p><P> October 12, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BUENA PARK;  </P> <P> SILVERADO DAYS EVENT KEYS ON DRUG FIGHT  </P> <P> A salute to "Drug Abuse Resistance Education" will be the theme for this year's  Silverado Days, an annual Buena Park event sponsored by the Noon Lions Club.  The festivities will start at 3 p.m today at Peak Park, with carnival rides,  games and food.  </P> <P> Highlights of this year's four-day celebration include a canine beauty contest,  youth parade, special bicycle raffle, boxing match and pie-eating contest.  </P> <P> In 1932, members of the Buena Park business community organized the first event  to promote their town. It was called "Home Town Days" until 1957, when downtown  merchants, worried about the trend toward newer, more convenient shopping  centers, decided to spruce up the festival and attach more of a Western theme.  </P> <P> The event is not a fund-raiser for the Lions Club; profits will go directly to  local groups.  </P> <P> Peak Park is bounded by Knott Avenue and El Monte and El Dorado drives near La  Palma Avenue. For more information, call (714) 826-5666.  </P></p>

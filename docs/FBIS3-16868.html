			<p>Language: <F P=105>Armenian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Zhirair Liparityan, Armenian first deputy foreign  minister, made a statement to reporters today in connection with  the [Iranian] plane crash. Mr. Liparityan said:    [Begin Liparityan recording] You might have already heard  that last night an Iranian C-130 aircraft flying from Moscow to  Tehran deviated by some 100 km from its established path for  unknown reasons after crossing Georgian airspace. It did not  enter the Armenian zone. It appears that it entered Azerbaijani  airspace and then was involved in an accident 14 km from  Stepanakert. It is not clear what happened. The only thing we  know is that at around 2200 Tbilisi informed our air traffic  controllers that the plane would enter Armenian airspace at  2208. But, in fact it did not. A search started after that.  The accident involving the Iranian aircraft took place at  around 2230. Even this is not clear. In addition to the crew,  civilians were also on board. The exact number is not clear.  There should have been 13 crewmen. There were also others.  [words indistinct] Probably some 30, 31 people.    We had no direct involvement with this incident because the  plane was not in contact with us. But we are already providing  every assistance to the Iranian Embassy and Government to  facilitate the solution of the problems arising from this  incident. I can only add that there is clear information that  plane was experiencing technical difficulties; defects,  technical defects.    This is all we know. And no one can say anything more  definite than this.    Sorry, I will not reply to your questions today. Everything  we know for certain I conveyed to you. Thank you. [end  recording]</p>

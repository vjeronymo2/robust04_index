			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Fausto Guzman] </F>   [Text] We are now in Pasaquina, La Union Department, where  disturbances have been reported. At 1245 a ballot box was  invalidated. We now have a statement by alternate deputy for  the department of [three-second break in reception] for Radio  Cadena YSKL.    [Begin unidentified alternate deputy recording] Thank you.  First I would like to thank YSKL for the opportunity to address  the Salvadoran people to state my [four-second break in  reception] of the city of Pasaquina at 1245 today. The members  of the Democratic Convergence-Farabundo Marti National  Liberation Front [CD-FMLN] coalition withdrew from all 23  polling stations without any explanation.    Their only pretext was that they had discovered that a man  --  who they claim was Honduran -- had already voted and was  carrying an electoral card. They said they were going to  withdraw from all the polling stations for that reason. The  president of the Municipal Electoral Board, who is also the  coalition's representative, also withdrew. However, because of  pressure from the Supreme Electoral Tribunal, from Onusal [UN  Observer Mission for El Salvador], and from the secretary of the  Municipal Electoral Board, a dialogue was held two hours after  these gentlemen withdrew. The gentlemen from the Municipal  Electoral Board were unable to reach an agreement because they  claim that there had been fraud.    They have criticized the installation of the orientation  center of the Nationalist Republic Alliance, ARENA, in front of  the central park in this city. They claim that votes were being  bought and sold at this orientation center and that fraud was  being committed, which is not true. When we saw that they were  trying to accuse our party, ARENA, we invited Onusal and other  observers from the United States and other countries to see for  themselves that the orientation center was being used to help  illiterate people vote. We all know that the percentage of  illiterate people in our country is high. All we were doing at  the orientation center was asking people for their  identification cards, looking for their names on the electoral  lists, and then telling them where they were supposed to vote  and where their voting table was. The people of Pasaquina came  out to vote. They showed that they wanted to participate. Only  they know which candidate they are electing for the presidency  and the vice presidency.

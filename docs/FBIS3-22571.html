			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Health Minister Jaime Freundt-Thurne announced that  precautions have been taken to prevent propagation from a case  of hemorrhagic (or type II) dengue, a disease that has occurred  in the country for the first time. He claimed that it could  prove lethal if the necessary measures are not adopted.    He explained that classic dengue (type I), caused by the  bite  of the anopheles mosquito that transmits the disease, is common,  primarily in the jungle and in certain northern zones. No cases  of the "hemorrhagic" type or of type III, which are extremely  serious diseases, had ever been reported. He noted that orders  have been issued to fumigate the habitats and to send medicines  for treatment.    Those stricken with hemorrhagic dengue show not only bodily  illness and high fever, symptoms of the so-called "classic"  type, but also hemorrhages of various origins. Hence, as he  explained, treatment based on consumption of liquids and blood  transfusions is necessary.  <H5>  Dengue Arrived in 1953 </H5>   If a chronology is made, it may be claimed that epidemics of  simple dengue were first reported in the country during 1953 and  1958. Later, in 1990, there were isolated outbreaks in the  cities of Iquitos, Tarapoto, and Pucallpa.    During 1991, new cases were reported in the locality of  Pachanaqui (Junin); and in 1992, in Zorritos (Lambayeque).    During 1993, 80 cases were recorded in Sullana; 270 in  Tarapoto alone; 34 in Junin; 34 in the Grau region; 177 in  Loreto; 37 in San Martin; and 27 in Ucayali. During the week of  5-11 December, four cases were reported in Tarapoto.  <H5>  Tuberculosis and Cholera </H5>   The health minister made these statements before signing an  agreement with the minister of the Presidency, Manuel Vara  Ochoa; the director of Foncodes [National Compensation and  Social Development Fund], Arturo Woodman; and the representative  of the Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO), Luis Loyola. Its  purpose is to carry out a program of prevention, control, and  treatment for tuberculosis patients among populations at risk in  Lima and Callao.    He asserted that the incidence of TB has declined, and that,  if this continues, it would mean that progress has been made in  early diagnosis and public treatment with basic medications.  <H5>  Statistics in Lima and Callao </H5>   The official statistics show that, in Lima and Callao, there  were 26,200 cases in 1992 and 24,800 in 1993. Last year, 55,500  patients were reported throughout the country; and this year,  the figure was 54,000.    It was indicated that the treatment program, costing  2,799,852 soles, will benefit 12,500 TB patients, who will be  admitted to the Health Ministry's 568 establishments during 1994.</p>

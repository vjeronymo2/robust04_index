			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / British Coal faces clash with watchdog British Coal ceased pumping operations yesterday at the disused Horden pit in County Durham, saving Pounds 1m a year and ending water pumping at the county's former coastal pits, Chris Tighe writes. British Coal said it intended a gradual shutdown of most remaining pumping stations in County Durham - a policy which could put it on a collision course with the National Rivers Authority, the pollution watchdog. British Coal said it envisaged a gradual cut in the number of stations without any environmental consequences. The NRA warned only last month that minewater pumping in the central Durham coalfield must continue to prevent a serious pollution threat to the river Wear. Yesterday it repeated it would not agree to more pumping reductions unless British Coal could satisfy it that there would be no increased risk of pollution. Workers at the Tursdale mine service centre in County Durham voted yesterday to accept closure. Tursdale and Bestwood in Nottinghamshire, British Coal's last two mine workshops, will close on Friday with a loss of 467 jobs.</p>

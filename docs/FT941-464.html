			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / People: Non-executive directors London Clubs International, the casino group, has stepped up its preparations for a flotation later this year by announcing the appointment of Robert Wood as a non-executive director. The appointment of Wood, deputy chairman of John Laing, the construction company, brings the number of London Clubs' non-executives to five out of a board of nine. In 1992, the group secured new licences for its London casinos, putting behind it the troubles which arose from a raid on its premises the previous year. Since then, the company has acquired a new non-executive chairman in Sir Gordon Booth, a former senior diplomat and ex-director of Hanson. Alan Goodenough, a veteran leisure operator, joined as chief executive last year. Sir Gordon says the group particularly wants to tap Wood's property expertise in the run-up to its listing.</p>

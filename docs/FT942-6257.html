			<p>940531 FT  31 MAY 94 / International Company News: Poland plans to maintain tough licensing policy for new banks The National Bank of Poland (NBP), the central bank, intends to maintain its tough licensing policy for new domestic and foreign banks, Mr Witold Kozinski, the bank's deputy chairman, said. His comments mean that foreign banks such as Chase Manhattan and Deutsche Bank, which have applications pending for the establishment of wholly-owned subsidiaries in Poland, are unlikely to be accepted in the near future. An exception is the joint application by Dresdner Bank and the Banque Nationale de Paris, which is in its final stages. 'Everything points to a successful conclusion (to this application),' Mr Kozinski said. 'We are waiting for them to clarify some points in their business plan,' he added. The green light for Dresdner signifies recognition of the bank's role as chair of the London Club creditors' steering committee, which negotiated a 45 per cent reduction in Poland's Dollars 13bn commercial bank debt last march. However, the NBP will continue to invite the remaining applicants to take stakes in the dozen or so newly formed local private banks. These are struggling under the weight of poor loan portfolios or are unable to raise new funds to avoid failure. 'We would also consider investments by foreign banks in some of our healthy banks,' Mr Kozinski said, adding that the NBP was ready to grant tax breaks and make capital injections in cases where foreign banks decided to take over an ailing local bank. The NBP is aiming to consolidate the private banking sector. This comprises 62 banks of which about one-fifth face the prospect of bankruptcy. These banks were established in 1990 and 1991 and have suffered from inexperienced management which allowed bad loans to accumulate without building adequate reserves. The NBP then issued licences to 10 foreign banks, including Citibank and the International Bank in Poland (whose shareholders include Credit Lyonnais and the Banca Commerciale Italiana). These have earned large profits by concentrating on cash management services and foreign exchange dealing, and have pursued conservative lending policies. The locally owned private banks account for about 20 per cent of the banking system's capital base. The majority is still in the hands of state sector banks which were recapitalised last year and present less cause for concern.</p>

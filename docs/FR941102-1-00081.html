			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The witness also testified that the effect of somatic cell  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> levels on fluid milk products is reflected in higher acid degree  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> values that indicate rancidity and off flavors, resulting in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shorter shelf life.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The expert witness testified that routine testing for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> somatic cells is conducted using a Foss-O-Matic infrared  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analyzer. The reference method for testing is the direct  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> microscope somatic cell count in which the sample is stained and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the somatic cells are counted using a microscope. The witness  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> explained that if the electronic instruments are calibrated to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the same reference samples the resulting test values and standard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deviations should be in close agreement. The witness concluded  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that on a relative basis the results should be close to what  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be obtained using other analytical tests.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The notice of hearing contained a proposal by CMPC to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> include an adjustment for somatic cells. However at the hearing,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a witness for CMPC explained that CMPC had decided neither to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> support nor oppose the inclusion of a somatic cell adjuster in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the amended orders. The CMPC witness testified that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individual members of CMPC were free to support or oppose any of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the somatic cell proposals as they saw fit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As originally proposed by CMPC, the somatic cell adjustment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be computed by multiplying the National Cheese Exchange  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> barrel price times .0005. The resulting quantity would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> multiplied by 500 minus the somatic cell count of the milk, in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> thousands. The resulting value would be applied on a per  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hundredweight basis. As explained by a witness for CMPC, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed somatic cell adjuster would apply to all producer milk,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> including that purchased by Class I handlers. The witness went  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on to explain that the effect of somatic cells on the value of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> producer milk and milk used in Class II and Class III would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> included in the computation of the producer price differential.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A somatic cell adjustment on Class I milk would not be included  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the pool, and therefore would not affect Class I handlers'  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cost of milk.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A witness for WCMA quoted extensively from the MCP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recommended decisions for the Indiana, Ohio Valley, and Eastern  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ohio-Western Pennsylvania milk marketing orders, and for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Michigan milk order, supporting the inclusion of an adjustment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for somatic cells in Federal orders. The witness supported the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CMPC proposal, but suggested that the somatic cell adjustment be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applied to all milk; that is, Class I milk would not be exempted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from a somatic cell adjustment. In addition, he proposed that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the somatic cell adjustment be applied to the protein price  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rather than on a hundredweight basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A witness for TAPP and FUMMC expressed support for including  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a somatic cell adjustment in the amended orders. The TAPP&hyph;FUMMC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> brief also supported such a provision. The witness stated that a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> somatic cell adjustment would benefit producers, handlers, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consumers by increasing the volume of milk marketed, improving  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> yield, and supplying consumers with more nutritious, better  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quality dairy products. The TAPP/FUMMC witness explained that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their proposal would have a neutral range of 301,000 to 400,000  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> somatic cells with a one-cent positive adjustment for each 50,000  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> somatic cell count below the neutral range up to a maximum of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> six cents as the somatic cell count declined, and a one cent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> negative adjustment for each 50,000 somatic cell count above the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> neutral range up to a maximum of ten cents as the somatic cell  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> count increased. The TAPP/FUMMC witness testified that under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their proposal the somatic cell adjustment would apply to all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> producer milk, milk used in Class III, and, if the plan is to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> revenue neutral, also to milk used in Class II.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A witness for Swiss Valley Farms Company (Swiss Valley)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> testified in support of including additions and subtractions for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> somatic cells in the amended order.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Swiss Valley witness  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> explained that somatic cells add proteolytic and lipolytic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enzymes to the milk, as well as a plasmin enzyme that is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> extremely heat stable, such that it is not deactivated during  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pasteurization. Therefore, the enzyme continues to degrade the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> milk during storage. The witness added that low SCC milk is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> important to the Swiss Valley bottling operations because it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> results in fluid milk products of improved flavor, and to their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cheese-making operations because of the resulting higher casein  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and lower whey protein content of the milk, which increases  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturing returns.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

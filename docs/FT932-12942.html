			<p>930426 FT  26 APR 93 / Leading Article: The bombing of the City LONDONERS picking their way back to work today through a litter of broken glass should spare a moment's thought for the cities of Northern Ireland, devastated over the past quarter-century on a scale that defies comparison with Saturday's damage in the City. If the Northern Ireland policy supported by all Britain's political parties is correct, it would be quite wrong to waver in it now merely because the buildings being damaged are in Bishopsgate not Belfast. In discovering the vulnerability of London's financial district to large, primitive bombs, the IRA has put its hands on a fresh, powerful weapon. That does not of itself change the nature of the political problem - it merely adds to its urgency. These are the issues of principle. But many people, in the City and elsewhere, will find one practical issue more pressing. How great a threat do two huge explosions in a year pose to London's position as a financial centre? The initial responses of some of the companies most affected by the two giant bomb attacks are reported elsewhere in this issue. On this sort of occasion, however, second thoughts are the ones that count. They will be influenced by a number of factors. First will be the adequacy of the insurance arrangements, underpinned by government guarantee, which were set in place after last year's explosion. The scheme is in its infancy; its enabling legislation has yet to pass through parliament. The government would be right to avoid legalism in its approach to this issue. The important thing is to make sure that the scheme works, and that the state provides the backing necessary for it to do so. Escape route A second factor is the way in which changing modern business practices reduce the impact of this sort of disaster. These days, a large business has its files, its intellectual capital, its soul, stored in its computers. That sounds like an added risk, but in fact it is an escape-route. Providing the computer operators have been taking routine security measures - backing up the files daily, storing copies safely off-site, and so on - the entire system can be rapidly re-created elsewhere. The third factor is less encouraging. The risk is that the bombing will be one more reason to view London as different, risky, a place at the margin, subject to its own unpredictable influences. There are enough of such forces already at work: the EMS debacle, the Taurus collapse, the City's well-known transport problems, the local authority swaps fiasco - even the perennial nuisance of passing through immigration controls at Heathrow. City's advantages Until now, these have been far outweighed by London's countervailing advantages: an open, innovative atmosphere, skilled labour and support services, welcoming authorities, and a cosmopolitan financial tradition. Two bombs are unlikely to tilt the balance. But it is the future risks that matter; and even with extra security precautions, they will clearly be much greater than they seemed 13 months ago. Britain's big financial houses are tied to London; so are the handful of leading international ones. It is the smaller, more footloose institutions - the ones that give the London markets their unique breadth and depth - which can choose to vote with their feet. Ensuring that their decisions come down in London's favour will require tighter security precautions, keener intelligence and better use of police resources. But as important will be a renewed determination to focus on the other aspects of the City's competitiveness. The speed with which the City has coped with the two big disasters of the past year is a tribute to the professionalism of its support staff and the flexibility and commitment of its workforce. Those are among the reasons why London has remained the leading international financial centre. Its chances of retaining that title were high before Saturday's bomb. They remain high now - as long as the government, the City authorities and the leading financial houses display a commitment not just to London's physical security, but also to its future competitive advantage.</p>

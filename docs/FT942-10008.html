			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / Government Bonds: Bundesbank rate cuts spark rallies across Europe The Bundesbank cut its key interest rates by a generous 50 basis points, prompting a wave of interest rate cuts across the continent by other European central banks and triggering rallies in the European government bond markets. The German central bank lowered its discount rate, which provides the effective floor for money market rates, to 4.5 per cent from 5.0 per cent while the Lombard rate was cut from 6.5 per cent to 6.0 per cent. The central banks of France, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, Austria and Denmark all eased interest rates during the day, sparking gains particularly among shorter-dated issues with the result that many of the European yield curves steepened. But while bond markets rallied initially, profit-taking later eradicated some of the gains, and towards the end of the session, dealers noted that European markets were once again focusing on the US Treasury bond market, awaiting a move by the US Federal Reserve. German government bonds ended the day mixed with the short and ultra-long dated issues closing higher on the day, while 10-year bonds were either unchanged or slightly lower. The bund market rallied ahead of the Bundesbank council meeting, then dropped back on profit-taking before recovering again in the afternoon. The Liffe June bund future contract ended down 0.04 at 95.02 while the DTB's June medium-dated Bobl future ended up 0.17 at 100.50. The Bank of France cut its intervention rate by 10 basis points to 5.5 per cent first thing yesterday morning, following Tuesday's cut in the German repo rate and pre-empting the Bundesbank's discount and Lombard cuts. French government bonds rallied, and dealers said the market could now expect to see a further snip in the intervention rate early next week. The Matif's notional bond futures contract settled up 0.50 at 120.20. Italian government bonds opened on a firm note, pleased with the announcement of the new cabinet on Tuesday evening and more significantly with yesterday's half-point cut in the discount rate from 7.5 per cent to 7.0 per cent. Short-dated issues showed the strongest gains while the Liffe BTP future ended down 0.20 at 111.85 after profit-taking by traders and investors. Of all the European markets, Spain continued to under-perform as political worries and scandals dogged the bond market. The bond futures contract ended half a point lower, and analysts predicted that the shake-out was likely to be prolonged. The gilt market closed firmer as the market kicked off on a strong note, and then made further gains on the back of the interest rate cuts in Europe. As on the continent, the short-dated issues were the main beneficiaries, gaining  3/8 of a point on the day. Japanese government bond prices rallied as money market interest rates declined further and the bond market saw strong domestic demand. The overnight call rate fell to a historic low of 2 1/16 per cent, encouraging talk in the market of an official discount rate cut. The JGB futures contract opened at 112.60 and reached a high of 113.06, ending Tokyo trading at 112.95 and trading at 113.00 in London. US Treasuries continued their rollercoaster ride, falling sharply following a disappointing 10-year note auction. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down 1 7/32 at 84 3/32 , to yield 7.607 per cent. Prices were also weaker at the short end of the market, where the two-year note was down  1/8 at 98 23/32 , yielding 6.184 per cent. At the opening of trading, the market was temporarily lifted by a higher dollar, which rose after the Bundesbank cut German interest rates by 50 basis points. Prices at the long end eased later in the morning, however, as traders and investors struggled to digest the implications of the Bundesbank's action. Some analysts said the cut, designed to aid the struggling German economy, would take the pressure off the need for the Federal Reserve to raise US interest rates to support the ailing dollar, while others argued that a rate increase from the Fed was still likely because of the need to slow the US economy. Later in the day, prices began to drop quickly after the sale of Dollars 12bn in new 10-year notes was poorly received in the market.</p>

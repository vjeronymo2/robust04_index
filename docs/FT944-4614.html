			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / Survey of Zimbabwe (7): Grassroots are bare - How drought hit a village For the economy of Zimbabwe, the drought of 1992, the worst in living memory, was a disaster. Gross domestic product fell by about 8 per cent as agricultural production was cut by a quarter. Forty per cent of the population required food aid when production of maize, the staple crop, plunged to a quarter of its usual level. Higher imports and lower export earnings pushed the current account deficit up sharply and sent inflation spiralling to a peak of 48 per cent. For the villagers of Chichevo, in the parched south-eastern district of Chibi, the drought was a catastrophe from which they have yet to recover. They watched as their crops wilted and their oxen died, leaving them with nothing but their bare hands to hoe the unyielding soil. Reviving Chichevo, and thousands of other smallholdings in the poorest areas of Zimbabwe - Natural Regions 4 and 5 - where 70 per cent of the population lives, will be crucial to the recovery of the whole economy. Agriculture, though accounting for only 14 per cent of GDP, employs nearly three-quarters of the population and contributes up to 45 per cent of exports. For donor countries, getting aid to smallholders in these vulnerable areas, and making it work effectively, will be one of the biggest challenges they have yet faced. Chibi district, in the province of Masvingo, is one of the driest areas of the country. Average rainfall is between 30cm and 50cm a year. Smallholders farm just one hectare of land on average, and 53 per cent of the 157,000 farmers are women, the men having sought work in the towns. The drought of 1992 wiped out 70 per cent of the cattle in Chibi, leaving people with nothing to sell to pay school fees and no animals for ploughing. The village of Chichevo lies about 4km from the main road along a rough track through dry bush. Mrs Pauline Chaumba, 45, suffered a fate typical of the villagers during the drought - all 20 of her cattle died. But because her husband works as a plumber in the town of Mashava, 120km away, she was not entitled to food aid. Mrs Chaumba tries to produce enough food for her mother, herself and her seven children from three hectares. Last year, as usual, she did not have any surplus maize to sell, and her only outside income was ZDollars 120 for four tins of peanut butter which she ground from the nuts she grew. After the drought, Mrs Chaumba burned the cattle shelters for firewood, since she had no further use for them. Yet the village has not given up hope. Under the expert guidance of Mrs Loveness Chari, their local agricultural officer, the 68-strong group of farmers built a 1.5km dam by hand to irrigate their maize and to grow vegetables to supplement their basic diet. They have laid pipes to carry the water and stocked the lake with fish, with the help of the government agricultural service. All they need is an engine to pump the water to the crops. But it costs too much. Whether they, and thousands of other smallholders, realise their hopes depends on the government and donor agencies. Such grassroots initiatives are exactly what the United Nations International Fund for Agricultural Development (Ifad) is anxious to encourage and finance in two new projects covering the dry, low-lying southern regions of Zimbabwe. The fund's mandate is to help the poorest rural smallholders become self-sufficient by supporting projects they have chosen. But donor agencies face many obstacles. The dry areas have become a government priority only since the drought. The emphasis on economic growth in the 1980s put resources into the more profitable agricultural sectors, and research and training was geared to areas with higher rainfall. The structural adjustment programme, which coincided painfully with the drought, has cut civil service jobs, and there is only one agricultural extension officer for every 700-800 smallholders. About 70 per cent of the extension service's budget goes on wages, rather than direct help for farmers. Officially, the government strongly backs Ifad's objectives. 'Grassroots involvement is the starting point,' says Mr Kumbirai Kangai, the agriculture minister. 'You let people tell you how you can assist them.' In practice, encouraged by some donor nations, the government has concentrated on high-profile, large-scale dams which are often costly to maintain and fail to serve smallholders' needs. Mr David Hasluck, director of the mainly white Commercial Farmers' Union, is sceptical about the success of efforts to devolve power. 'Don't believe the government thinks the people know what's good for them. The government knows what's good for them. It believed that in 1980, and it hasn't changed.' Whether aid gets through can depend heavily on political connections. The government's free distribution of seed and fertiliser, a vote-catcher in the run-up to next year's elections, threatens to conflict with donor attempts to generate self-sufficiency. Given such constraints, it might seem optimistic for the UN fund to predict that its south-east dry areas project, due to be approved by its board early next year, will generate increases in maize yields of 50-133 per cent. Mr Edward Heinemann, project controller, admits there are many uncertainties. 'But 20 years of experience with these sorts of projects has shown that only by being flexible and involving communities at every step is there any chance of sustainability,' he says.</p>

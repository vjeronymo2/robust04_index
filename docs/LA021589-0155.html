			<p><P> February 15, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BUSH'S PLAN TO HELP S&amp;LS INADEQUATE, NADER WARNS  </P> <P> President Bush's plan to bail out ailing savings and loans does not provide  enough money or reforms to rescue the thrift industry, consumer advocate Ralph  Nader said today.  </P> <P> At a news conference to disclose his proposals for fixing the S&amp;L crisis,  Nader said he was glad that Bush, in outlining the Administration's proposed  solution last week, has recognized a $100-billion problem exists.  </P> <P> But Nader said that the Bush plan sharply underestimates the amount of money  needed to bail out the insolvent thrifts and that taxpayers will be forced in  future years to make up the difference.  </P> <P> "It does not follow that the Bush government has to place the burden of the  FSLIC (Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp.) bailout on the backs of those  taxpayers who are the least able to pay," Nader said.  </P> <P> "Instead, the burden . . . should fall primarily on those most able to pay or  engaged in financial activities providing only limited or arguable productive  benefit to society," he added.  </P> <P> The Bush plan includes $40 billion in taxpayers' money, $50 billion in bonds to  be repaid by the thrift industry, a federal takeover of about 300 insolvent  institutions and new regulatory oversight by the Treasury Department and the  Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which previously insured commercial banks but  not thrifts.  </P> <P> More than 500 of the nation's 3,100 thrifts are now broke or near to  insolvency. The Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., which insures  deposits up to $100,000 in thrifts, cannot deal with the problem because it,  too, is technically insolvent.  </P> <P> The Bush plan inadequately addresses the problem of bank managers using  depositors' money to make risky or bad loans or, as happened so often in recent  years, engaging in fraud, Nader said.  </P></p>

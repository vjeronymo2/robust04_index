			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: Thatcher backs Patten over China BARONESS THATCHER, the former prime minister, last night used a Lords debate on Hong Kong and China to make a spirited defence of Mr Chris Patten, the colony's governor. Other speakers - including two former governors - expressed regret and alarm at the possible consequences of the row between Britain and China but Lady Thatcher praised her former cabinet colleague for his 'great sensitivity and skill'. She described the controversial October speech in which Mr Patten outlined proposals to extend the scope of democracy in Hong Kong as splendid and magnificently constructed. The governor had not proposed anything that conflicted with the 1984 Sino-British joint declaration. In common with other speakers, Lady Thatcher emphasised that Mr Patten's proposals were 'only a basis for discussion' and expressed 'great disappointment' that China had so far declined to make its contribution to the debate. But while sincerely wishing it will prove possible to 'proceed along with' China, 'this cannot be at the expense of what we believe to be right,' she warned. 'In the last resort, it is Britain that has responsibility for governing Hong Kong up to 1997.' Lady Thatcher also used the occasion to broadcast a message to the incoming Clinton administration in the United States that it would be 'profoundly misguided' to put pressure on China over human rights by restricting trade. President George Bush had been 'excellently right' to resist using that blunt weapon, she said. In his maiden speech in the Lords, Lord Wilson of Tillyorn, Mr Patten's predecessor as governor, commended the way his successor had endeared himself to the people of Hong Kong but expressed alarm at the intensity and implications of the dispute. He hoped other proposals would indeed be put forward 'so there may be a chance to find a structure for the 1995 elections which will be satisfactory to the people of Hong Kong'. The continuity which had been one of the chief aims and achievements of the joint declaration was a very important objective for Hong Kong. Lord Maclehose of Beoch, another former governor, said the violence with which the Chinese had responded to the proposals had produced what was approaching a crisis with progress apparently blocked. He said the Chinese appeared to have a point that the spirit if not the letter of the 1990 agreement has been breached. If passed into law, Mr Patten's proposals would operate only from 1995 until 1997. Mr Patten 'may have been misdirected over these proposals, but I am sure he has the political experience, flexibility and indeed charisma to lead Hong Kong back into a working political relationship with China.' Baroness Dunn, a senior member of Hong Kong's executive council, said Britain bore a share of the blame for the current predicament. Was it really surprising, after a history of deals 'cut behind closed doors' that the Chinese government should find the new British openness of approach difficult to comprehend, she asked. Baroness Chalker, foreign office minister, accused China of 'increasingly strident propaganda attacks.'</p>

			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / Survey of Using Computers in Business (29): Large-scale development project - Case study Large-scale software development projects need especially rigorous project management. When N. V. Nederlandse Gasunie, the Dutch gas distribution utility, decided to update its operational control systems in the mid-1980s, it recognised that it would need expert help. 'The project was about 170 man years and had over 100 people working together to build the new system,' says Mr Theo Bakker, a principal consultant at Gasunie. 'Although it is not the most complex system it was a very big project and needed tight management.' Gasunie buys and distributes gas throughout the Netherlands and exports it to other European countries such as Germany and Italy. It uses automated equipment to monitor and control operations on the national distribution network. The monitoring equipment records the temperature, pressure and flow of gas through the pipelines and passes it to a computer network, controlled from a central computer in Groningen. The data is passed to a Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system which keeps track of the gas network and issues commands to alter its state. The new system had to replace both of these systems and bring them together with two others: a system to monitor and administrate export contracts and one to simulate the gas network for modelling purposes. Gasunie turned to software company Logica to help construct the new system and to use its experience of managing large-scale projects. 'Logica has a good record in project management and this was one of the main reasons for taking them on. We split the responsibility for the project with Logica taking about 70 per cent of the load,' says Mr Bakker. He praises Logica's skills highly: 'They have a very structured approach with good quality assurance procedures and controls. They have very good reporting mechanisms and always kept us up to date and showed they know how to manage complex projects with a technically-high standard. But most of all they have good discipline. I have worked with many software companies that have the methods and the tools but they don't have the discipline.' The new system took over three years to build and was finally commissioned in December 1992 to the satisfaction of the user. Mr Bakker says the system is easy to maintain and very flexible: 'We decided to take on the maintenance ourselves. We had four people on the development project team specifically to build up knowledge of the system and do maintenance. Logica did it for the first year and now we do it all ourselves.' Despite the undoubted success of the Gasunie project, it was not perfect, however. Mr Bakker notes: 'Logica failed to deliver it in the specified time  - there was a delay of seven or eight months'. Mr Martin Ashton, the project leader from Logica, points out that the delay was at the beginning of the project and that it was known about well in advance: 'It is such a big system and, although we new the design integration would require a lot of work, we underestimated how long it would take. We managed to compensate by delivering some parts of the system earlier than scheduled,' he says.</p>

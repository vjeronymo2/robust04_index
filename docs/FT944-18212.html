			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / Berlusconi urged to release report on Fininvest Opposition politicians are pressing Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian prime minister, to publish a report which he commissioned to resolve the conflict of interest with his ownership of Fininvest, the country's second largest private business group. The report, commissioned by Mr Berlusconi when he took office in May, was handed over to the prime minister on Thursday. Mr Berlusconi has so far refused to comment on its contents, fuelling suggestions that he does not accept the conclusions. Mr Cesare Salvi, head of the Progressive grouping of senators, the main opposition in the upper house, has called for urgent distribution of the report to parliament. Other politicians have urged action from President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, who encouraged the idea of a special commission. The conflict of interest issue has come increasingly to the fore as the right-wing coalition extends its control over the Rai, the state broadcasting organisation, while Mr Berlusconi still retains ownership of Fininvest that dominates 80 per cent of commercial television with its three national channels. When Mr Berlusconi entered politics in January, he merely distanced himself from daily management of Fininvest. The company recorded a L11,600bn (Pounds 4.72bn) turnover in 1993, with debts of L3,900bn. Since becoming prime minister he had been made fully aware of the problems but appears reluctant to lose the ownership or see Fininvest broken up. At first he sought to involve President Scalfaro as a special guarantor to monitor potential conflicts of interests. But the president ruled this out as unconstitutional. Mr Berlusconi then opted for a three-man commission of legal experts with an open brief. Having personally selected the three members, it will not be easy to reject their conclusions. The commission is composed of legal experts, including Mr Agostino Gambino, a law professor who has done work for Fininvest. Those close to the commission argue it is almost impossible to employ the US model of a blind trust to Fininvest. Such a trust functions where assets have already been sold and then invested by trustees with the owner being 'blind' to the nature of the fiduciary investments. Suggestions that Fininvest ownership be placed in trust in the names of his five children have not found favour with Mr Berlusconi because of tax problems the children might incur. Opposition politicians are wary of this solution because they believe he would not be sufficiently distanced from his empire - which he has every intention of returning to once his political venture ends. The once clear-cut solution - a quick disposal of Fininvest assets - is virtually impossible. This would call into question the entire nature of television ownership in Italy, raise anti-trust issues in publishing and open a debate on foreign investment in the media. But until a solution is found, Mr Berlusconi risks constant conflicts of interest, the most serious being over the government's control of the Rai. Others are more insidious. Last week for instance, in announcing the budget, he encouraged people to switch to private pension funds - Fininvest's Mediolanum financial services are promoting private pension funds. Yesterday it emerged his authority was used to curb the sexual content of American television serials shown on Fininvest channels. His wife, Veronica, had apparently urged action after being contacted by a pro-Vatican journalist. The Fininvest programmes showing what the Italian press has dubbed 'soap erotica' are now being sanitised or shown at different hours.</p>

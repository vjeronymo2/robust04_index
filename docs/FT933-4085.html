			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / Survey of Dutch Banking and Investment (4): Guilder remains resilient - Economic Outlook / The Netherlands has so far been able to avoid the worst effects of recession in Germany, its biggest trading partner ONE positive result of last month's dramatic disintegration of the European Monetary System - for the Netherlands, at any rate - is that it has underlined the resilience and strength of the Dutch guilder. Of all the EC currencies in the mechanism, only the guilder was able to hold on to its 2.5 per cent band with the German mark. All the others retreated to 15 per cent bands, effectively leaving only the guilder and the D-Mark to carry on the old-style EMS. In the short term, the decline in value of other European currencies will put pressure on the Netherlands' export-led economy and its export-dependent companies. But in the long term, the guilder's ability to maintain its link to the D-Mark means the Netherlands can expect to reap the benefits of low inflation. Indeed, the outcome of the currency turmoil can be seen a back-handed compliment to the Netherlands' unswerving commitment over the past 10 years to pegging the guilder to the D-Mark. Over the years, this policy has often encountered domestic criticism, particularly in times of rising interest rates such as in the immediate aftermath of German reunification. But the fall-out from the recent EMS crisis appears to have vindicated the 'strong guilder' efforts of the past. 'I think people will now stop seeing the Dutch central bank as merely a slave to the Bundesbank,' one bank economist says. 'It's clearly in our interests to be linked to the D-Mark. The Nederlandsche Bank, the Dutch central bank, says it was partly this link that enabled the country to get its structural, or underlying, inflation rate down to around 3 per cent in the 1990s from an average of 6.6 per cent in the 1960s and 1970s. The day after the EMS debacle, the Dutch finance ministry also noted, 'the coupling of the guilder to the D-Mark has made a strong contribution to the fact that the level of Dutch short and long-term interest rates is among the lowest in Europe.' Several times in 1993, the Dutch central bank was able to cut interest rates independently of the Bundesbank. This demonstrated that, in many ways, the Dutch economy is actually putting in a stronger performance than that of its powerful eastern neighbour. For example, Dutch inflation is considerably lower than that of Germany, as is growth in unit wage costs. Most importantly, the Netherlands has not yet followed Germany into deep recession, though Dutch growth rates are clearly faltering. Growth in gross national product, which peaked at 4.7 per cent in 1989, fell to just 1.4 per cent last year and could slow to 0.5 per cent or less in 1993, economists predict. Although consumer spending is holding up relatively well, unemployment is rising quickly, in line with the trend in other parts of Europe. Opinions are divided on whether the Netherlands is already in a full-blown recession. For this reason, some economists prefer to describe the situation as one of 'recessionary growth' or even a 'velvet recession." According to strict economic definitions, the country dipped into recession in early 1993. In the fourth quarter of 1992, the economy contracted by 0.1 per cent compared with the third quarter, and this was followed by a further 0.4 per cent drop in the first three months of 1993. Nevertheless, the figures are not entirely conclusive because the declines were so slight. At the same time, provisional figures for the second-quarter gross domestic product show that growth was flat in the spring, meaning that the recession has bottomed out. In any case, it is clear that, so far, the Netherlands has been able to avoid the worst effects of recession in Germany, its biggest trading partner, which is projected to suffer a 2 per cent decline in economic growth this year. Even though 30 per cent share of Dutch exports go to Germany, the pain of German recession has been eased by the fact that the Netherlands' foreign sales are heavily weighted in favour of less cyclical sectors such as agriculture and energy. A quarter of Dutch goods sold in Germany are foodstuffs or food-related. This was particularly beneficial in the early days of German re-unification, when Dutch horticulturists moved quickly to satisfy pent-up demand for fresh vegetables in the former East Germany. Another reason why the Netherlands has been able to absorb Germany's economic downturn is that wage rises were kept low throughout the 1980s and are still well below Germany's increases, accounting partly for continued Dutch competitiveness. For this reason, industry's traditional calls for wage restraint have intensified in the past few months, particularly since the breakdown down of the EMS. If other European currencies drop sharply against the D-Mark and the guilder, Dutch companies will inevitably be forced to choose between reducing profit margins to retain their share of export markets or accepting a loss of European market share to protect overall profitability.</p>

			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / International Company News: KNP BT recovery continues KNP BT, the Dutch paper and packaging group, swung into a profit of Fl 74m (Dollars 42.3m) in the second quarter of 1994 from a loss of Fl 3m a year ago, extending the recovery that emerged earlier this year. The results, which follow a similar return to profit in the first quarter, take first-half results to Fl 124m, a reversal of the previous year's Fl 16m loss. The company said it was moderately optimistic but cautioned that it could see temporary pressure on margins as a result of further increases in raw material prices. It said volume was up substantially in most markets. Turnover rose by 12.4 per cent to Fl 3.2bn in the second quarter and by 13.1 per cent to Fl 6.3bn in the first half. Of the group's four main businesses, paper merchanting, graphic systems and paper production all posted strong increases in results in the second quarter. The exception was packaging, where operating profit slipped to Fl 86m from Fl 90m. KNP BT attributed the decline to rises in raw material prices, particularly for waste paper. KNP BT also announced yesterday that it may merge the US arm of its office products division with Ivan Allen of Atlanta, Georgia, which it described as the largest office products distributor in the south-east of the US. A letter of intent has been signed but talks on a definitive deal are continuing. The Dutch company, which gave no financial details, has made a string of small office-product acquisitions in the US and Germany so far this year.</p>

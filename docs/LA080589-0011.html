			<p><P> August 5, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. RESPONSE TO MIDEAST TERRORISM  </P> <P> We are all outraged and frustrated over the latest barbaric act committed by an  Iranian-controlled fundamentalist terrorist group in Lebanon.  </P> <P> The apparent tragic, brutal execution of Higgins and the obscene threats to  murder additional innocent Western hostages once again underscore the real  obstacles to progress and peace in the Middle East.  </P> <P> As Americans we are affected only occasionally by acts of barbarism and  terrorism; the people of Israel live in the very midst of a culture of violence  and war and endure it on a daily basis.  </P> <P> As a nation that is regularly subjected to acts of terrorism, Israel has the  right to defend itself. It would be a great injustice indeed if, in our  frustration over our current inability to deal directly with the barbaric  behavior of the Hezbollah, we were to strike out at our closest ally or remain  silent while certain of our leaders unjustly criticize its actions.  </P> <P> DOUGLAS E. MIRELL  </P> <P> President, American Jewish Congress  </P> <P> Pacific Southwest Region  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] A group which includes a number of trade unionists  has asked Nigerians not to do anything that would disrupt the  Constitutional Conference election, scheduled for Monday [23  May]. In a two-page statement, the group, which includes:  Comrades Yomi Olusanya, Adetola Oseni, Chief Dayo Abata, Mrs.  M.I. Akpankpa, Dr. David Ogunsede, and Chief Tayo Soyode, said  it would be strategically unwise and politically suicidal for  any ethnic group to boycott the proposed national constitutional  conference.    The group recalled the experience of the nation in calling  for a similar boycott order, by those it described as  progressives in the 1964 federal elections, and declared that it  would be wiser to use the constitutional conference platform to  build a genuine national consensus for a fresh re-examination of  the aborted democratic march, than to boycott it. According to  the group, a boycott of the conference will turn the gathering  into a conspiracy theater, and will not be in the long-term  interest of any ethnic group.</p>

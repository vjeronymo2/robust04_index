			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Juan Ramon Rojas] </F>   [Text] San Jose, 9 Mar (ACAN-EFE) -- Strengthening  relations with the United States, a greater rapprochement with  Central and South American countries, and a vigorous effort to  incorporate Costa Rica into world commerce will guide foreign  policy during the new social democratic government to be  inaugurated on 8 May.    Foreign Minister-designate Fernando Narajo has said Costa  Rican foreign policy will play a more dynamic and expedient role  in promoting trade and attracting investments, as well as in  seeking to overcome the differences that have marked ties with  Washington during the current government.    "We want our officials to play a very important role abroad,  and to that effect we are proposing every mission have a  specific work program we will evaluate periodically," Naranjo  told ACAN-EFE shortly after his appointment was announced.    Naranjo, a 51-year-old economist, former finance minister,  and adviser of several regional countries, said with this work  "one is not trying to supplant" his foreign commerce colleague,  Jose Rossi, "rather, to get our missions to do a good commercial  work."    The future foreign minister has said he will seek to further  ties with Central America, as he is convinced a small country  such as Costa Rica "can only have an impact on economic  relations if it works closely with the other regional  countries." In addition to Central America, Naranjo has said  he will also pay special attention to relations with Chile,  Colombia, and Venezuelan, nations with which Costa Rica "has  many commercial possibilities" in view of the increase in  exchange that has been registered in the past years.    Naranjo has said his country's incorporation into the North  American Free Trade Agreement, signed by Canada, the United  States, and Mexico, "will be vital," which is why "we need good  representations in Washington, Ottawa, and Mexico City."    After three years of negotiations, Costa Rica and Mexico  agreed to sign a free trade agreement that will become effective  in January of next year and will allow, according to  projections, a rapid increase of commercial exchange and  investments between the two countries. Along these lines, he  said the other aspect on which he will focus his attention is  the delegation to be named in Geneva (Switzerland, GATT  headquarters).    "We are going to place a great deal of stress on all of  this," Naranjo has said. He flew to Chile today to accompany  President-elect Jose Maria Figueres to attend the inauguration  of Eduardo Frei. This is Figueres' first trip outside the  country since he won the elections on 6 February.    The future foreign minister also said "it is no secret"  relations with Washington have cooled over demands by U.S. labor  unions and lawsuits filed regarding expropriations made in the  past 20 years.    "The United States has been complaining we are not paying  attention to a series of problems that are not major, although,  as a whole, they cause problems," and he admitted that during  Figueres' visit to Washington in April they hope to have "very  frank" conversations to agree on what "we must do to improve  those relations."    "What is true is in today's world of strategic alliances we  cannot fight with our friends," the economist has warned.    Naranjo has said Costa Rica has had a "longstanding"  friendship with Washington, and it is not fair that "minor  problems should be causing major differences."    The future foreign minister, who will replace Bernd Niehaus  on 8 May, said another area of action will be promoting human  rights, the democratic system, and civilian rule, as "Costa Rica  has traditionally been doing."    In this respect, he announced creation of the Foreign  Cooperation Agency for Human Development [Agencia de Cooperacion  Exterior para el Desarrollo Humano], which will have the double  function of coordinating the assistance Costa Rica receives and  funneling this country's cooperation to other nations.    "Costa Rica can play a very different role in the future of  many Central American nations and the Caribbean with this  cooperation agency," for which it hopes to also have the support  of "friendly countries," Naranjo has said.</p>

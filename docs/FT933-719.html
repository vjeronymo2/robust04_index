			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / Falklands 'voice' for Scott evidence MR IAN McDONALD, the distinctive voice of the government during the Falklands war in 1982, is to appear before the Scott arms-for-Iraq inquiry. The former acting chief of public relations at the Ministry of Defence, responsible for disseminating information to the media, is to be questioned on October 6 about his subsequent role in vetting sensitive defence exports to Iraq during the 1980s. As the head of the ministry's Defence Export Services Secretariat, he is expected to shed some light on why colleagues ignored warnings about the export of machine tools by British companies contributing to a build-up of Iraq's defence capability.</p>

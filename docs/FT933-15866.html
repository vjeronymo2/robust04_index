			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / Airports to reduce night flights NEW night-flying restrictions designed to cut noise at Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted airports are to start in October, David Owen writes. The government announced yesterday that a new quota system based on the noise of different types of aircraft would be introduced, replacing the current regime based on the number of aircraft movements. Under the new system, the louder the aircraft, the more its use at night will use up an airport's quota. Separate regulations will ensure that louder aircraft, such as the BAC 1-11, will be phased out within a decade. The new system is to operate for five years.</p>

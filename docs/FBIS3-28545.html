			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Kyong Yong-won: "`ROK-U.S. Joint Operations </F> Plan' Set Up in 1992"]    [Text] It has been disclosed that the ROK and the United  States, in their joint operations plan worked out in 1992 in  preparation for a North Korean southward invasion, introduced  the new concept of active defense aimed at destroying the North  Korean regime and reunifying the country under the ROK  initiative instead of the old concept of negative defensive  operations. The disclosure of this plan draws our attention.    The relevant officials of the Ministry of National Defense  [MND] say that this change was not made abruptly at that time  but because the ROK and the United States felt the shortcomings  of the negative operational concept in the sixties and seventies  for the North Korean southward invasion, they gradually  introduced the offensive operational concept of air-raid on and  advance to the North Korean rear areas. The MND officials say  that this has nothing to do with the present North Korean  nuclear issue.    Until the mid-seventies, the ROK and the United States had a  negative operational concept against the North Korean southward  invasion of abandoning Seoul, if unavoidable, and retreating to  the area south of Seoul, and, taking step-by-step counter-attack  actions when the U.S. reinforcement arrives and repelling the  enemy to the area north of the truce line.    The ROK side strongly suggested to the U.S. side on several  occasions that Seoul not be abandoned. Accordingly, the  operations plan changed in the mid-seventies to the effect that  the North Korean advance should be checked in the area north of  Seoul.    In the early eighties, the old concept came under criticism  calling for stronger punishment for war provokers, and the  ROK-U.S. operations plan took on a more offensive nature  incorporating the U.S. Air-Land Battle [as published] concept.  The concept was that if North Korea wages a preemptive attack,  the ROK-U.S. Combined Forces would attack major facilities in  the North Korean area with Air Force planes and special forces.  As soon as large-scale reinforcement forces arrive from the  U.S. mainland, the ROK-U.S. forces would make offensive  operations, landing large-scale landing forces in the North  Korean rear areas, thus dealing North Korea a serious blow.    This strategy was developed from the mid-eighties to the  early nineties, but the ROK and the United States could not  establish a precise target as to what extent we should strike  North Korea.    The issue of "target" began to be discussed in 1990 when  General RisCassi assumed the post of commander of the ROK-U.S.  Combined Forces and began a fundamental review of the ROK-U.S.  operations plan. In the discussion of this subject, the ROK and  the United States differed in their views at one time.    The ROK and the United States finally agreed in 1992 that  they would occupy or isolate Pyongyang, decide on advancement  north of Pyongyang in stages according to the situation, and  proceed to attack North Korea just enough to demolish its regime  and for the ROK to gain the initiative in reunification.    According to this "new operational plan 5027," the ROK and  the United States have established a 5-step scenario against  possible southward invasion by North Korea.    First, they will prevent war by deploying U.S. rapid  deployment deterrent forces (FDO) [expansion unknown] on the  Korean peninsula.    Second, if a war takes place, they will deter North  Korea's southward invasion north of Seoul and destroy strategic  facilities at North Korea's rear.    Third, they will annihilate North Korea's major combat  capabilities and conduct large-scale landing operations while  breaking through battle lines to advance northward.    Fourth, they will isolate Pyongyang and place occupied  areas of North Korea under their military rule.    Fifth, they will achieve reunification of the Korean  peninsula upon the ROK's initiative.    Military officials say that these changes in the ROK-U.S.  joint operations plan, both in name and reality, enables  preparedness against a possible North Korean southward invasion,  and if necessary, guarantees the destruction of the North Korean  regime and reunification according to the ROK's initiative.    The details of the changes which have only now been  disclosed, are reported by the U.S. media as though a U.S. idea  being realized based on its current hard line policy on the  North Korean nuclear issue. The Defense Ministry officials  regard the U.S. media's recent reports on this and policies to  reinforce the ROK-based U.S. Forces, such as the deployment of  Patriot missiles and Apache helicopters, as a series of U.S.  moves aimed at creating tension on the Korean peninsula, and  they are keeping careful watch over the behavior of the U.S.  Government and media.</p>

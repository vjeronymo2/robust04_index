			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / 3i shares jump 20 1/2 p on first day The flotation of 3i, one of the largest of this year's share offers, provided a pleasant surprise for subscribers yesterday when its shares jumped 20 1/2 p to 292 1/2 p on their first day of trading. The shares had been marketed as a quality institutional shareholding rather than a stagging opportunity, and the public offer was only 1.1 times subscribed. In contrast, Exco, the moneybroker which starts trading today, was seen as a better target for stags because of its relatively cheaper price. Its offer was 3.2 times subscribed and a healthy premium is expected today above its 175p offer price. Analysts attributed 3i's strong performance to instutitional buying in the market after their allocations had been scaled down. The institutional offer, valued at Pounds 533.6m, had been 1.7 times subscribed. 'I am pleasantly surprised,' said Mr Hamish Buchan, director of equities at NatWest Securities. 'But people should bear in mind that small companies have been weak since March 31, and they have not participated in the latest stock market rally.' The FT-SE Small Cap index has fallen 5.9 per cent since 3i's assets - investments in small companies - were valued on March 31. Analysts suggested 3i's assets would have fallen in value by a similar degree. At the issue price, 3i shares were valued at a 13 per cent discount to their March asset value. The company offered 45 per cent of its shares (261.6m in total), of which three quarters went to institutions. The institutional portion was well supported, but only a small proportion of the 385,000 private investors who registered for a prospectus actually applied for shares.</p>

			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Signs of OFT approval for Granada bid There were growing signs last night that the Office of Fair Trading has cleared the Granada bid for LWT, subject to the condition that the advertising sales houses involved really do operate on an arms length basis. The OFT decision on the bid, has, it is believed, now gone to Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary. The intention was to make an announcement today, but it is not clear whether this will be possible because of Mr Heseltine's other commitments. The Independent Television Commission has made it clear that it is prepared to accept a system of Chinese Walls between sales houses for the time being, as long as there are no shared directors or business contacts between the two houses involved. The ITC is reviewing the rules on advertising sales.</p>

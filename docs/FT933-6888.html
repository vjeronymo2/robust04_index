			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / Letters to the Editor: Price theory cannot apply to environment Sir, Your leader describes as 'absurd' the resistance of many non-conformists to the notion that everything - including rainforests and whales - has a price ('Valuing the environment', August 19). What is equally absurd is the conviction of economists that everything does have a price, even if it is only a price estimated (by economists) using one of a number of valuation techniques. The logical outcome of this position is that the last whale should be killed or the last acre of open countryside paved over if the economic benefits outweigh both economic and (fully internalised) environmental costs. Even if the shortcomings of present modes of economics can be overcome, which is questionable, there remains the critical moral issue of whether the current generation has the right to damage irreversibly the environment that will be inherited by our descendants, even if we are willing to 'pay' for the damage. Daly (a World Bank economist) and Cobb argue in relation to carbon dioxide emissions in their book, For the Common Good: 'Instead of beginning with the impossible task of calculating full-cost prices and then letting the market determine the right quantities on the basis of these prices, we could begin with the 'right' quantities and let the market calculate the corresponding prices.' This principle applies across the board, with the 'right quantities' of environmental costs being those that allow society to function within the quantitative and qualitative capacity of the environment. Defining those quantities will inevitably be fraught with uncertainty and controversy. It may prove to be more useful and acceptable than waiting for economists to find the 'price' of environmentally sustainable economic activity.

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Commentary by Manuel Esquivel Acevedo] </F>   [Text] I feel compelled to disagree totally with the  opinion expressed by Attorney Juan A. Munguia, president of the  National Development Bank. There are at least five factors that  the government should be aware of before it reaches the  conclusion that there are not enough funds in the National  Development Bank for cotton production.    1. Is Mr. Munguia out of touch with reality?    Anyone who lives in Leon or Chinandega knows how serious the  crisis is in this western region. The level of unemployment in  areas where peasants are out of work is shocking, and 100,000  manzanas of land lies fallow, out of production thanks to  bureaucrats like this one.    2. The current neo-agricultural policy of the Development  Bank:    This financial institution was founded to deal with sectors  like cotton that have an impact on the country's economy. There  are three factors that the governments' Economic and Productive  Committee should be aware of:    a. Cotton is a crop that farmers are familiar with, and they  have mastered the techniques of growing it.    b. According to German Technical Aid (GTZ), cotton is grown  today with superior technology and at reasonable production  costs.    c. The price of $76.60 per gold quintal, given current  costs,  makes this a profitable activity that would bring in substantial  amounts of foreign exchange for the country.    3. The possibility of shoring up the cotton loan portfolio:    Cotton is a financial activity that is loaded down with  balances and restructuring. Yet the international price could  turn cotton into a profitable activity again and help cotton  producers with their debts. It used to be said that "a cotton  debt can only be paid with cotton."    4. The generation of employment in the western region:    The cultivation of cotton generates much direct and indirect  employment, so there is an urgent need to create profitable  initiatives that will create jobs. Besides, did not the current  government promise the people prosperity? Is not the role of  government to create jobs to benefit the poorest and neediest  segments of society? This is an opportunity to make up for the  negative consequences of the neoliberal financial policies that  are so dehumanizing.    5. Set up a consultation with cotton experts:    The economic importance of this crop and the foreign  currency  that it can bring into the country mean that we need a more  prudent consideration of the matter than an attorney can  provide. I suggest that we consult with people who know the  field and who can also help arrive at a more comprehensive,  professional, and prudent decision based on consensus, rather  than the decision made by Attorney Munguia, which I consider to  be dogmatic and irresponsible. It should be noted that one  swallow does not make a summer, and, on the other hand, the  suggestion "Cobbler, stick to your last" comes to mind.    In conclusion:     -  I suggest that we pay more attention to the real plight of  our people, who are jobless, hungry, poor, etc. This will only  lead to social instability, and in short, a minimal private and  foreign investment.    -  We need to orient our resources toward  profitable initiatives that producers are familiar with and that  can contribute to the improvement of the bank's cotton loan  portfolio.    -  Unemployment in the western region and banking and  financial reforms should not be handled in a dogmatic manner, or  without consideration for the people's socioeconomic interests;  the socioeconomic interests of everyone are one thing, and  lending the bank's money to serve the interests of a single  group is quite another.    -  Be open to the different options for  financing cotton production, because peasant unemployment and  idle land are not conducive to social stability; on the  contrary, all social tension or social tranquility begins in the  countryside.</p>

			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / Letter: An effective way to relieve fuel VAT burden Sir, There seems to be a kind of death wish in the way in which the government has handled the issue of VAT on domestic fuel. The Treasury and the Bank of England have both made the case for the unpalatable necessity for increasing taxes; and the most effective way to raise the substantial sums involved must of necessity be by extending the scope of VAT. The extension of VAT to domestic fuel is one of the more palatable options. The need with this option must be to protect those on low incomes. The method chosen of promising adjustments in benefits paid to compensate for the imposition of VAT on domestic fuel has had all the predictable reactions and has been shown to be politically inept. A simple but effective way to overcome the problem would be to institute a de minimus rule for all fuel bills so that if the total quarterly bill were below a figure of, say, Pounds 50 no VAT would be charged and, if above, full VAT would be chargeable. In effect, the relief is at the point of sale and as such is the most effective and cheap way of providing relief. Stewart Cohen, 24 Carlton House Terrace, London SW1Y 5AP</p>

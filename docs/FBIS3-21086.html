			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The duration of the commission that is currently  governing the Italian Space Agency has been extended. While it  is under this commission that the agency is being restructured  to enable it to soon operate with a new leadership, the  principle guidelines for its activities will be decided by the  government. The fact that the finance bill did provide  sufficient funding to allow the ASI [Italian Space Agency] to  respect all its obligations has meant that some international  agreements have had to be rediscussed. This anyway comes within  the general modification of the situation following Russia's  entry into the space station program. The CIRA, [Italian  Aerospace Research Center] that was "completely disorganized,"  has also been reorganized and it has been possible to release  600 billion lire for its operation. However, its role has been  completely redefined as far as programs are concerned, changing  its direction toward aeronautical topics with programs that  decisively favor national industry in the sector to help it  "participate in new international programs with dignity."  <H5>  CIRA Funding Released </H5>   At a press conference held on 11 January, University and  Scientifical and Technological Research Minister Umberto Colombo  described those aspects of the document, which he presented to  the cabinet meeting on 27 December, on "Research for  Development: Government Lines of Action on Research and  Innovation Policy," that directly affect aerospace research. As  well as giving suggestions for the future, the document  describes the results of the actions that were taken to balance  the accounts almost a year ago now.    The availability of the funds for the CIRA that have finally  been released is one example of the actions taken by MURST  [Ministry of Universities and Scientific and Technological  Research] to compensate for the inadequacy of the resources that  the country makes available for research, recuperating  efficiency wherever possible. Colombo stated that: "Through  improvements obtained by eliminating areas of inefficiency or  bad management it has been possible to recuperate about 3.3  trillion lire, this being about 15 percent of the annual funding  for public research, which in 1993 totaled 23 trillion lire. In  this way, that is, substantially by demobilizing a mass of  passive outstanding amounts that are mainly the results of  burdensome bureaucratic procedures, we have managed to more than  balance the reduction of 4.5 percent that the finance bill made  on the budgets for research bodies in 1994. As well as  providing for the above-mentioned Aerospace Research Center this  release of funds includes 390 billion lire under Law No. 46 on  industrial research, 1.5 trillion lire for programs inherited  from the former Cassa del Mezzogiorno [Extraordinary  Intervention Fund for Southern Italy], 300 billion lire for  science and technology parks, and 600 billion lire for national  research programs into the environment, remote controlled  medicine, biotechnology, electronic machine tools,  neurosciences, pharmacy, building and the textile industry.  <H5>  A Warning From The Minister </H5>   Colombo warned that although the situation has been remedied  in this way this year, it will not be possible to do any more.  Italy must inevitably dedicate greater resources to innovation  from now on. "It will shortly be necessary to increase the  resources that are available because the gap separating us from  the other industrialized countries has now reached an  intolerable width."    It is also necessary to take some action, particularly  within  the small and medium-sized industries, to assist the culture of  technological innovation that is traditionally lacking in Italy  despite the diffused cult for "noble" science. We are risking  isolation, not from the most prestigious goals of science, but  from the benefits that this and leading-edge technologies bring  to a nation's productive system, and therefore to its economy  and employment.    Colombo placed particular emphasis on this latter point,  insisting on the basic change in national research policy that  the document proposes. Strategies should be defined in advance,  instead of allowing the researchers themselves to indicate the  goals that should be aimed at generally without any reference to  the overall interest of the country, as has happened up to now.    It is necessary to focus on promoting innovation and its  rapid application in the productive sectors of the leading  industrial areas and on promoting advanced technologies that  have a strong capacity for diffusion. It is also necessary to  reinforce R&amp;D activities relating to the modernization of the  infrastructure networks (computer science "but verifying where  it is really needed," telecommunications, and transport).  Generally speaking, the sprinkling of interventions that  Colombo recognizes the validity of for basic research, as far as  "targeted" research is concerned, should leave the way clear for  consistent support to be given to the sectors that have an  assured potential for economic development while an effective  control of expenditure and results must be guaranteed.    Research should be organized to avoid wasting efforts, even  in sectors of research that have already been widely explored by  other nations and sectors that have little in common with our  sectors of "excellence" -- in which manufacturing fields that  only apparently have little connection with technological  innovation, such as clothing and food production, must be  renewed -- and in keeping with the European R&amp;D program,  which  was recently approved thanks to Italy's decisive contribution,  Colombo recalled.</p>

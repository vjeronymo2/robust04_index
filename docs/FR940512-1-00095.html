			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) *&blank;*&blank;* This section does not apply to projects for the elderly or handicapped (except for units housing children less than six years of age) or projects subject to an application for insurance under sections 231, 232, 241, or 242 of the National Housing Act. *&blank;*&blank;*  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Defective paint surfaces.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the case of a residential structure constructed before 1978, the HUD or coinsurer's architect and the sponsor's architect shall inspect the property for defective paint surfaces before the issuance of a commitment. If defective paint surfaces are found, testing and abatement as required by &sect;35.24(b) of this title shall be completed before final endorsement as a condition of the firm commitment. If defective paint surfaces are tested, a random sample of dwelling units shall be tested as required by paragraph (e) of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Chewable surfaces <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> _(1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Random sample.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the case of a residential structure constructed before 1978, a random sample of dwelling units shall be tested for lead-based paint on chewable surfaces as required by paragraph (e) of this section, including a sample of common areas and exterior chewable surfaces. Common areas included in the sample should include nondwelling facilities commonly used by children less than six years of age, such as child care centers. All chewable surfaces in selected units shall be tested. If none of the tested units, common areas or exterior chewable surfaces contain lead-based paint, the project may be considered free of lead-based paint, and no further testing or abatement action will be required. If lead-based paint is found in any unit in the sample, all units in the project are required to be tested. If lead-based paint is found in any common area, all common areas in the project are required to be tested. If lead-based paint is found in any exterior chewable surface, all exterior chewable surfaces in the project are required to be tested.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Testing requirements.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Testing shall be performed using an X-ray fluorescence analyzer (XRF) or by laboratory analysis of paint samples. Test readings of 1 mg/cm2 or higher using an XRF shall be considered positive for presence of lead based paint. If the laboratory reports the test results in percent by weight the standard shall be 0.5 percent or 5000 parts per million (ppm). Testing of chewable surfaces shall be performed by a State or local health or housing agency or by an inspector certified or regulated by the State or local health or housing agency. The testing entity shall certify to the results of the test. The mortgagor shall be responsible for obtaining these testing services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) *&blank;*&blank;* Treatment shall consist of covering or removal of the paint surface in accordance with &sect;35.24(b)(4) in this title. *&blank;*&blank;*  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Abatement without testing.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In lieu of the procedures set forth in paragraphs (c)(1), (2) and (3) of this section, in the case of a residential structure constructed before 1978, the developer may forego testing and abatement and abate all chewable surfaces in accordance with the methods set out in &sect;35.24(b)(4) of this title before final endorsement. HUD or the coinsuring lender will reinspect all units after repair and before final endorsement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> EBL child.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the case of a residential structure constructed before 1978, if the developer is presented with test results that indicate a child less than six years of age living in a unit has an EBL, the developer must test defective paint surfaces and chewable surfaces in the unit occupied by the child. If such test is positive for lead-based paint, the developer either:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Must abate the unit surfaces in accordance with the methods set out at &sect;35.24(b) of this title; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) If the developer chooses not to test, the developer must abate all unit surfaces.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Random sampling of units.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Random sampling of housing units for testing of chewable and defective paint surfaces shall be based on the following table:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

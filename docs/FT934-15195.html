			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / A fool's wise words: Mitterrand and Havel have taken different roles on the European stage There was more than a whiff of history about last weekend's summit of the Council of Europe in Vienna. Parallels were drawn between the 'concert of Europe' established at the 1815 Congress of Vienna to keep the post-Napoleonic peace, and this Council of Europe whose 32 members were meeting to try to define a post-cold war European order. At least, that's what the more visionary among them thought they should be doing. Others may have had a more limited view of what it was all about. The council can hardly claim to be one of the main centres of power in today's world, or even today's Europe. It does not deal with military or economic matters, and neither the US nor Russia is a member (though Russia has applied to join). Their representatives were cleared from the room, along with other riff-raff such as the presidents of Albania and Croatia, not to mention myself, after the opening speeches and before the 'working session' began. Officially, the summit had serious work to do. It had to streamline the control machinery of the European Convention on Human Rights, and to agree on ways of protecting national minorities. In reality all that had been done before it started, in months of negotiation among officials. The summit itself was a series of set-piece speeches, most of which were distributed to the press. Two speeches made a particular impression on those who were privileged to hear them - both made by presidents who have been central figures on the European stage but no longer enjoy the reality of power in their own countries. The summit, an occasion for sounding alarms and setting guidelines rather than detailed horsetrading, might have been tailor-made for them. Indeed, it was tailor-made by one of them, for the summit had been Francois Mitterrand's idea. The French president's speech - 35 minutes without a text  -seemed to some of those who heard it like the final homily of a patriarch to his wayward children. As paraphrased by the well-briefed reporters of Le Monde, the French president 'described the tormented, incomplete landscape of the greater Europe - with fragmentation, dislocation, war on one side, and on the other a multiplicity of institutions with only a partial vocation, none of them capable of giving structure to the whole'. The EC, he pointed out, has a very high entrance fee, and 'cannot, in the foreseeable future, open its doors to all'. As for the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, it is 'everyone and no one', said Mr Mitterrand. 'Who has ever seen their security protected by it?' Apparently he did not mention Nato, but he hardly needed to. Delegates had only to return to their hotel rooms and switch on CNN, to see President Bill Clinton struggling to extricate the US from Somalia while reporters quoted White House officials as saying the chances of the US committing troops to keep the peace in Bosnia were now greatly reduced. So, in Mr Mitterrand's view, there is a need for some new structure to fill the vacuum. Could not the Council of Europe become its 'embryo'? Mr Vaclav Havel spoke next. His speech had been translated, printed and distributed hours before, but it was a devastating riposte - not only to Mr Mitterrand but to all the west European leaders present. He denounced 'the erroneous belief that the great European task before us is a purely technical, a purely administrative, or a purely systemic matter, and that all we need to do, therefore, is come up with ingenious structures, new institutions and new legal norms and regulations . . . without the negotiating partners ever attempting to change anything in themselves and in the habitual motives and stereotypes of their behaviour. 'Twice in the 20th century,' the Czech president went on, 'the whole of Europe has paid a tragic price for the narrow-mindedness and lack of imagination of its democracies' - first when they retreated before Nazism and second when they 'allowed Stalin to swallow up one half of our continent'. And now, he warned, 'I am afraid a third such failure is threatening us. I am not only thinking of the caution and indecision that mark the attitudes of the developed part of western Europe towards the post-communist countries. I am thinking as well, and above all, of how they have behaved so far in relation to what is going on in Bosnia and Hercegovina, and in the whole of the former Yugoslavia . . . 'If various western states cannot rid themselves of their subconscious drive for a dominant position in their own sphere of interests, if they don't rid themselves of their self-centred protectionism and stop trying to outwit history by reducing the idea of Europe to a noble backdrop against which they continue to defend their own petty interests, and if the post-communist states do not make radical efforts to come to terms with the ghosts their newly won freedom has turned loose, then . . . ' Then what? A presidential speechwriter must have intervened, for Mr Havel concluded rather weakly: 'then Europe will only with great difficulty be able to respond to the challenge of the present and fulfil the opportunities that lie before it'. I would bet you anything his first draft said 'we shall all go to hell', or words to that effect. Mr Havel, of course, is a playwright, not a politician. And the part he has written himself, in the latest act of Europe's long-running tragedy, is that of the fool. One diplomat compared his Vienna speech to 'farting in church'. But in Shakespeare, and perhaps in other playwrights too, the fool often proves the wisest member of the cast.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [First part of Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet's speech at the </F> conclusion of Ninth National Assembly's Fifth Session in Hanoi  on 23 June -- announcer read]    [Text] First, on behalf of the government, I welcome the  results of this National Assembly session with the passing of  important laws that will have great significance and influence  on our renovation undertaking.    For its part, the government will closely coordinate with  the  related sectors under the National Assembly Standing Committee's  supervision to quickly promulgate the bylaws so that the newly  adopted laws can become effective early. Together with its main  duty, that is legislative work, the National Assembly also  devoted time to discussing the government report on the  implementation of socioeconomic duties in the first six months  of 1994 and on measures to accomplish all the socioeconomic  duties in 1994.    Authorized by the party and state, I recently led our  government delegation for an official working visit to the  Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and the Russian Federation. Therefore, I  could not attend the National Assembly debate directly.  However, since my return, I have received briefings on the  debate.    All National Assembly deputies expressed their interest in  the government report evaluating the socioeconomic development  in the first six months and on major issues that need particular  management attention in the last six months. The government is  really taking the opinions contributed by the deputies into  account. It considers these opinions a foundation for its  guidelines and operations in the last six months. Now, I would  like to further present and emphasize some issues so as to  complete the duties for 1994 and to prepare for the following  year:    1. The duty to concentrate all efforts on achieving all the  socioeconomic targets set forth for 1994.    As the government has reported earlier to the National  Assembly, 1994 plays an especially important role. This is the  year when a new period of socioeconomic development begins in  our country. While continuing to take care of our economic,  social, and political stabilization, in 1994 we now enjoy the  necessary conditions to accelerate socioeconomic development and  settle social issues, thus creating foundation for the  socioeconomic consolidation and the strengthening of our  national defense and security. This can help our country  extricate itself from the socioeconomic crisis and enter into a  period of stabilized and firm development.    The tasks for the last six months of the year are very  great.  The report presented by Deputy Prime Minister Phan Van Khai at  the opening session of the National Assembly pointed out six  types of difficult problems where concentrated efforts are  needed for a resolution.    I would like to further emphasize that apart from attaining  the various requirements for 1994, the implementation of various  tasks in the last six months of this year will also have a great  effect on the following year. The implementation of these tasks  requires great effort by the various sectors and echelons from  the central down to grass-roots levels. In the period ahead,  the government will hold meetings with various provincial and  city people's committees of all the three regions -- namely, the  south, the central highlands, and the north -- to review the  problems encountered by various regions. This is to determine  more substantive measures with which to resolve the difficult  issues now encountered by each region. The government will  strive to promptly promulgate various bylaws to provide guidance  for the enforcement of the laws already passed by the National  Assembly at this session. At the same time, we will also  reexamine and continue to supplement and perfect the current  system, structure and policies. This will involve a large  amount of difficult work. Now, I would like to move on to  concrete issues.    2. The state budget, credit sources for infrastructure  construction, and inflation.    Currently, the state budget, credit, and investment  situation  is severe.    A. State budget.    The balancing of the state budget is a pressing issue at  present. We must execute following measures:    -- We must use all measures to increase state revenue. These  measures must be based on the development of our economy. All  policies on revenue collection must be fully implemented. We  must fight against revenue loss and smuggling. The prices of  some goods must be adjusted. Especially, revenues collected  from the transfer of the rights on land usage, house sale, and  renting of government housing must be channeled to the state  budget.    -- To conform with the National Assembly resolution, the  government has carried out the frugality plan. Now, nearly 50  ministries and central organs and 20 provinces and cities have  registered to practice thrift in a common effort to save 2,000  billion dong. The government requests the remaining sectors and  localities to quickly establish their long overdue frugality  plan.    However, it is necessary to stress that the entire revenue  and savings from all sectors and localities must be used to  compensate overspending in the budget which had already been  approved by the National Assembly. The money must not be used  for other purposes. Therefore, the current mechanism for the  handling of the state budget must be adjusted. All ministries  and localities are only allowed to spend according to their  approved plans. New expenditure on national defense, security,  village and subward cadres, and on people who have rendered  meritorious service to the nation must be kept within the  reservation limits in their budget plans.    B. Infrastructure investment.    We need more investment to obtain a high level of economic  development, better economic structures, and gradually carry out  national industrialization and modernization. It is predicted  that investment nationwide will reach about 40,000 billion dong  in 1994. Direct foreign investment and private investment may  reach the estimated levels, but state investment through the  state budget and banking credit is still too little. Therefore,  it is necessary to reexamine all infrastructure construction  projects. If they have not completed all the building  requirements and not ready for the construction, they should be  canceled. For projects that are under construction, if it is  possible, their investment should be reduced and their work  slowed down. New projects, if possible, will also need to be  delayed.    The procedure for construction, verification, payment, and  finalization must be closely controlled. The prime minister has  issued Decision No. 92 on the restoration of order in  infrastructure construction and on the practice of thrift. He  will continue to amend and perfect more documents on  construction. It is suggested that the National Assembly  deputies, depending on their work areas, organize, motivate, and  check the execution of those instructions.    Business enterprises will be allowed to issue credit notes  and shares and obtain foreign loans according to government  regulations to maximize capital resources for construction,  especially for the renewal of equipment and technology. The  approval of the Law on the Promotion of Domestic Investment will  certainly encourage all economic sectors to engage in more  business and production investment from 1995.    C. Fight against inflation.    Despite no major price fluctuations in months, prices in the  first five months of 1994 increased by six percent compared to  the end of 1993. It is going to be difficult to keep price  increases to less than 10 percent for the whole year as we do  not allow the price of agricultural products to be decreased to  avoid affecting a majority of the peasants. It is necessary to  adjust the prices of some materials reasonably and improve the  supply and demand relationship. Some commodities suffering from  unbalanced supply and demand such as cement, sugar, and cotton  will have sudden price changes if they are not handled correctly.    The unbalanced state budget and lack of credit sources, if  not correctly settled, will cause inflation. Therefore, it is  necessary to improve goods production and circulation. At the  same time, we must be vigilant in regulating monetary  circulation. We must balance supply and demand to keep  inflation in single digits and avoid sudden changes to the  prices of goods, services, gold, and U.S. dollar exchange rates.</p>

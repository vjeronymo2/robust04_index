			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / The Coal White Paper: Electricity users may avoid pool RELIEF was expressed in the gas, electricity and nuclear industries after the government confirmed it had rejected radical solutions suggested by some contributors to the coal review. Mr Michael Heseltine refused to restrict the growth of gas-fired power generation to increase the market for coal, although he has provided a subsidy for coal to compete with world prices. He confirmed the timetable for increasing competition into the electricity market from 1994 to achieve a fully open market by 1998. There will be no restriction on sales of electricity from France. Mr Heseltine did say he was considering allowing large energy users, such as British Steel and ICI, to bypass the electricity pool or wholesale market, striking direct contracts with generators and avoiding the fluctuations in pool prices. In addition, the pool authorities are considering whether to give large users a cost incentive to shift their electricity demands to off-peak periods. There was also relief for the Nuclear Industry. The government said it saw no reason to force Nuclear Electric to close its Magnox stations, but is bringing the nuclear review forward by a year. Gas-fired generators say gas can compete with subsidised coal. 'It's the best we could have expected, given that there is a need for transitional arrangements for coal,' said Mr David Lewis, director of Enron Europe, the UK arm of the large US gas company. Enron will now press ahead with talks on building two additional gas-fired power stations at an investment of Pounds 800m. The company is bringing its 1,800MW station at Teesside on stream by the end of March.</p>

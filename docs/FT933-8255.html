			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / Arts: Saints and sinners / Review of the Holbeins at the Scottish National Gallery - The Edinburgh Festival The visual arts have always lived on the margin of the Edinburgh Festival. There have been memorable exhibitions at festival time over the years, but successive directors have seldom put much effort, let alone money, into their preparation and promotion, taking the view that any curator worth his salt would fill his gallery with something special to tempt the visitor. This year, however, all that has changed. The Festival's new director, Mr Brian McMaster, would clearly have none of it and, for the first time has banished the Scottish National Galleries and Museums, and pretty well everyone else for that matter, to the outer darkness so far as the Festival is concerned, where I hear there has been much wailing and gnashing of teeth. A solitary serious exhibition makes it into the official festival brochure - 'The Waking Dream' at the City Art Gallery, a splendid show, it must be said, of a prime selection of historic photographs in the Gilman Paper Company's collection, brought over by the Metropolitan Museum of New York. But this one exception, however splendid, serves only to make the broader omission the more perverse. Together the galleries in Edinburgh this year hold as strong a hand as for any recent festival. It is all very well for the new director to turn his back on all things visual, but the Festival's literature goes round the world, and who is to know how many potential punters might just have been persuaded to make the trip by the knowledge that the Queen's Holbeins (at the Scottish National Gallery), two centuries' worth of Scottish drawings and watercolours (at the Royal Scottish Academy), and an important show (at the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art) of early Russian avant-garde painting from Russian museums, and so much else besides, was there in Edinburgh to be enjoyed as well. Whether or not Mr McMaster has cloth ears I leave to my music-critic colleagues to judge, but that he should so arbitrarily visit upon his public the consequences of his having cloth eyes I do feel is hardly clever. The Holbein exhibition alone is a major event, major enough to be the centre-piece of the entire Festival. It is very small, nothing more than 29 drawings and five miniature paintings that barely fill the smallest of the Gallery's showing spaces, but what it lacks in size is more than made up in its visual impact. There are some 80 drawings in the royal collection, of which these are the principal and most famous examples and, in their strange and peculiar way, they are truly shocking things. Their capacity to shock is nothing to do with content or subject-matter. Here are simply Tudor lords, ladies or gentlemen as may be, registered in a consistent half-length format that celebrates directly neither their opulence nor power, though all are evidently comfortable. Rather they are presented with a most disarming and intimate naturalism, at it is precisely this quality of naturalism that makes them so shocking. It is a shock of recognition still potent across the centuries, a frisson of shared experience and common humanity. There these people are, young or old, beautiful or ugly, as fresh on the page as the day Holbein sat down to draw them, his friends and acquaintances, in such conversational ease. And with this naturalism, too, we catch perhaps that first shift of sensibility, which marks the cusp between the medieval and the modern. Perhaps it is that which is so shocking. Holbein made two extended visits to England, the first in 1526 as a young artist in his late twenties, when he came from his home at Basle to work very much under the wing of the King's new Lord Chancellor, in which office he had succeeded the disgraced Cardinal Wolsey, Sir Thomas More and his family. He went home again in 1528, returning to London in 1532 when he began to work rather more in the orbit of the Court itself. This second visit, behind which we sense rather more the looming presence of the King, saw not only the death of More, but the rise and fall of many if his new sitters, these heads, ambitious and wistful by turns, that we know all too well were so soon to roll. And it is by no means fanciful to detect, between the two groups into which the drawings naturally fall, a marked if subtle difference of mood and feeling. It is not so much that the intimacy is any the less, but is there is even so an emotional distance in the late works that was not there before. At ease he might be with the young Earl of Surrey or Sir Thomas Wyatt, and even friends, but yet the engagement is something more of a professional objectivity. With More and his family we cannot but feel that the artist felt himself entirely at home, and in such delicate images as those of More's ward, the youthful Anne Cresacre, or of Cicely Heron, his daughter, we have drawings of an immediacy and tenderness as any in the entire canon of western art. Technically the drawings are no less astonishing, worked as they are with an extraordinary economy of line and a quality of modelling through the form that leaves as much described by inference as actual statement. Many of the drawings of the later period are heavily reinforced in the outline in black ink. This was long thought to be an effort at restoration by a later, heavier hand, and the question is still controversial. But these are the working studies of a portrait painter, and it does seem that Holbein shifted from his earlier pin-prick method of transfer to one of actual tracing over a prepared ground. The key lies perhaps in the quality still evident for the most part in that tracing hand, the line still lively and effective in its inflection. Holbein is still there.

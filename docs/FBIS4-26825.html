			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Roundup"] </F>   [Text] Beijing, June 27 (XINHUA) -- A fanfare resounds this  afternoon once again in the front of the Great Hall of the  People.    Chinese President Jiang Zemin is hosting a ceremony to  welcome Mauritian President Cassam Uteem and accompanying him in  a review of a guard of honor of the three services of the  Chinese People's Liberation Army.    This is the sixth time this month that foreign heads of  state  and government have reviewed the Chinese honor guard, which, in  the past six months, has received foreign dignitaries from 26  countries, including the French prime minister and Egyptian  president.    The frequent appearance of the honor guard of the three  services in front of the Great Hall of the People reveals one  aspect the busy scenario of this year's Beijing diplomatic  activities.    In the meantime, Chinese leaders have toured the five  continents. The forthcoming official visit to Austria, Germany  and Romania by Premier Li Peng starting June 29 will be the  sixth major trip abroad by a senior Chinese leader.    For China, a country busily engaged in a modernization  drive,  a peaceful international environment constitutes a major  external condition, and the absorption of foreign capital,  technologies and advanced expertise is a crucial part of opening  up to the outside world.    Developing ties with other countries in the diplomatic,  economy and trade, scientific and technological, and cultural  fields is in line with China's present and future interests.    Consolidation and expansion of good-neighborly ties of  friendship with other countries remains atop China's diplomatic  agenda. Now, a stable and good-neighborly environment has come  into being and China's ties with its neighbors have entered the  best period in history.    In the past few months China has received the Azerbaijani  president and the Russian prime minister. During Premier Li  Peng's tour of four central Asian countries and Mongolia, China  signed a historic border agreement with Kazakhstan and a  friendship and co- operation treaty with Mongolia.    Frequent high-level exchanges are featured in this year's  Sino- Europe relations. In the first half of the year, China  played host to Romanian and Estonian presidents as well as prime  ministers from Slovakia, Finland, France and Portugal.    Meanwhile, chairman Qiao Shi of the Standing Committee of  the  National People's Congress and Chairman Li Ruihuan of the  National Committee of the Chinese People's Political  Consultative Conference called on eight European nations.    The good political links have lent an impetus to the  mutually  beneficial co-operation in economy and trade, and science and  technology. As a result, the economic and trade co-operation  between China and western Europe has maintained strong growth,  while that between China and eastern Europe has been  reinvigorated following a period of stagnation.    The past six months have also witnessed new growth in ties  between China and the American countries. A Chinese Communist  Party (CPC) group headed by Hu Jintao, member of the Standing  Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee,  travelled to Uruguay, Argentina and Brazil, and the presidents  of Ecuador, Surinam and Peru have been to China.    The trip to Beijing by Canadian Governor General Hnatyshyn  marked the normalization of all-round ties between the two  countries. The Canadian prime minister is also expected to be  here later this year.    Sino-U.S. ties have maintained the trend toward improvement  and development. U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen and  Secretary of State Warren Christopher have visited Beijing this  year, while Chinese Vice-Premier Zou Jiahua, State Councillor  Song Jian and Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic  Co-operation Wu Yi have been invited to visit the U.S. In  addition, the three joint commissions on economy, commerce and  trade, and science and technology have been reopened.    At the end of last May U.S. President Bill Clinton decided  to  extend China's most-favored-nation (MFN) status and to delink  future annual MFN reviews from human rights issues. The  decision creates favorable conditions for the further  strengthening and expansion of trade and economic co-operation  between the two sides and for the improvement and growth of the  overall relations between the two countries.    Meanwhile, during the past six months China has continued to  consolidate its unity and co-operation with African countries.  Earlier this year, it resumed diplomatic ties with Lesotho. And  the defunct apartheid system and the birth of a new South Africa  has created favorable conditions for the establishment and  development of friendly ties of co-operation between China and  South Africa.    Apart from all this, China has been actively involved in  multilateral diplomacy and has strengthened its co-operation  with other countries within the United Nations and other  international organizations.    At the 50th session of the UN Commission on Human Rights  last  March China frustrated, with the support of other  justice-upholding countries, an attempt to interfere in China's  internal affairs under the pretext of human rights. This once  again demonstrated the degree of unity and co-operation between  China and other developing countries.    At present, Beijing is vigorously making preparations for  the  Fourth World Conference on Women, to be held here next year.    In addition, after signing the Uruguay Round accords, China  is girding itself to become a founding member of the World Trade  Organization.</p>

			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / International Company News: Kerkorian expresses concern over Iacocca's leadership at Chrysler MR KIRK Kerkorian, the septuagenarian US investor, is finally rattling his sabre at Chrysler by indicating that he is no longer content to remain a passive investor. This move comes nearly two years after Mr Kerkorian baffled Wall Street by paying Dollars 270m for a 9.8 per cent stake in the third biggest US car maker. In a letter attached to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Mr Kerkorian said recent events 'have made me concerned about Mr Iacocca's continued leadership role in the company and led me to question whether the interests of the shareholders now require strengthened representation on the board of directors. I have reluctantly concluded they do'. Mr Lee Iacocca, the company's high-profile chairman, recently announced his intention to step down at the end of this year. Mr Kerkorian said he had made his investment after being assured that Mr Iacocca would remain as chairman through 1994. Mr Kerkorian has called for a prompt meeting between his representatives and a group of board members to 'resolve these important issues'. Mr Iacocca yesterday said a meeting between Mr Kerkorian's representatives and Chryler would be held shortly, but he added that his plans to step down at the end of the year were unchanged. 'I have complete confidence in the management team at Chrysler, and Mr Kerkorian told me that he shares that confidence,' he said. When Mr Kerkorian made his unsolicited investment in December 1990, Chrysler fortified its 'poison pill' anti-takeover defences by reducing the proportion of Chrysler shares one party has to buy to trigger its poison pill to 10 per cent from 20 per cent. Shareholders, other than the 10 per cent holder, also have the right to buy Chrysler stock at half price. Mr Kerkorian's options at Chrysler are limited. The poison pill prevents him from launching a bid, but he could press for some form of board representation and he could also embark on a proxy fight. Certainly, Chrysler's financial picture has improved substantially since Mr Kerkorian made his investment. The company recently reported surprisingly strong second-quarter results. Fur thermore, it is introducing several new models this year crucial to its future. On Wall Street, shares in Chrysler slipped Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 20 5/8 . The stock was trading at around Dollars 12 when Mr Kerkorian took his stake.</p>

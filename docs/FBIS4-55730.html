			<p>BFN     [Text] Skopje, 19 May (TANJUG) -- "My visit to Macedonia,  in the company of French General de Laprsle, UNPROFOR [UN  Protection Forces] commander for former Yugoslavia, is aimed at  gaining a first-hand insight into the country's internal and  external stability," head of UNPROFOR's mission in former  Yugoslavia, Japanese diplomat Yasushi Akashi, said this  afternoon.    We had a very fruitful discussion with President Kiro  Gligorov and Defense Minister Vlado Popovski. We wished to hear  their opinions, which will also help the United Nations  determine future moves -- especially as regards the stability of  borders and the improvement of economic and political stability,  Akashi said.    I discovered, unfortunately, that Macedonia was in an  unenviable economic situation due to its strict adherence to the  economic sanctions against Yugoslavia, and because of the  embargo imposed by Greece against Macedonia. I will convey  President Gligorov's message to UN Secretary-General Butrus  Butrus-Ghali. President Gligorov has suggested that the  Greek-Macedonian dispute be examined by the UN Security Council.  Akashi particularly stressed that the talks provided an  opportunity for a thorough analysis of the situation along  Macedonia's borders -- especially the sections monitored by  UNPROFOR.    Akashi also met UNPROFOR representatives in Macedonia in the  course of his one-day visit.</p>

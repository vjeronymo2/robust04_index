			<p><P> June 30, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES: WILSHIRE CENTER  </P> <P> Prints from Roy Lichtenstein's "Brushstroke Figure Series" are Pop art  renderings of Abstract Expressionist paint swipes that wind up being faintly  representational. They are fun loving, art-smart prints that toy with the  language of mechanical Cubism, Surrealism and the comic strip while pushing  hard on the technical end too. Each is a composite of lithograph, woodcut,  screen print and encaustic. The multiple media give Lichtenstein's trademark  screen print dots and cartoony brush strokes a genuine richness of surface that  further stretches the work into a self parody about what looks smart and what  looks like art. (Glenn-Dash Gallery, 962 N. La Brea Ave., to July 15.) SUVAN  GEER  </P></p>

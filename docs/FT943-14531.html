			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / Blair outlines fresh approach to welfare state Mr Tony Blair yesterday signalled his determination to give fresh direction to Labour's approach to the welfare state by emphasising its role as a 'springboard to success' rather than an instrument of dependency. In a speech which addressed also the growing insecurity of the nation's middle classes, Mr Blair signalled that the private sector as well as the public sector should be given a role in modernising the welfare system. He said the country's 'anxious majority' needed the security of modern welfare as much as the poor and the disadvantaged. Instead of debating the level of benefit spending, Labour would concentrate on making welfare more effective in getting people back to work and financially independent. The state should be offering services  - such as training and the provision of childcare - as well as cash. Anticipating the conclusions this autumn of Labour's Commission for Social Justice, Mr Blair said that the welfare state created by the post-war Labour government had to be adapted to the demands of a rapidly changing world. He told an audience at the Southampton Institute: 'The world has changed since 1945, there is no going back. Welfare must be harnessed to manage that change and create the opportunities and most importantly the security for people who are finding it hard to succeed.' In a deliberate attempt to discard the party's image as one of easy welfare handouts, Mr Blair accused the Conservatives of doubling 'benefit dependency' since 1979. Labour's objective would be to create a 'nation at work not on benefit'. Setting out a series of principles for reform Mr Blair said Labour must reduce dependency by removing disincentives to taking paid work. It must address the concerns of the 'insecure majority' by providing bridges between employment. Citing the 'absurd situation' of a woman being forced to give up a part-time job because her husband had become unemployed, Mr Blair said the party needed to reduce discrimination against women in the welfare system. Labour would also develop plans for 'lifelong learning' and make provision of re-skilling a vital complement to benefits. Welfare payments also needed to be more flexible to provide recipients with greater choice and opportunity. Mr Blair made no specific mention of his approach to the universality of payments such as child benefit but attacked the Conservative party's plans to extend the means-testing of benefits.</p>

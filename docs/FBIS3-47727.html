			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] THE Government has refused to sell some 200,000  tons of 100 percent white rice to Iran and has asked Iranian  representatives to contract with the private sector instead,  according to Commerce Minister Uthai Phimchaichon.    Mr Uthai made the comment yesterday after meeting with the  chairman of Iran's Government Trading Cooperative, Mahmoud  Ardakani.    Iran proposed to buy the rice on credit from the Thai  Government with delivery scheduled for March but Mr Uthai said  the authority to do that now rests with the Rice Policy  Committee chaired by Deputy Prime Minister Amnuai Wirawan.    Mr Uthai said does not want to intervene in the  private-sector rice market. He said the Government has not  entirely ruled out government-to-government sales but he  believes the private sector should have the first opportunity to  make deals. [passage omitted]</p>

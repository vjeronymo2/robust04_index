			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Beirut (DPA) -- On Tuesday [26 April] the  family of Lebanese Muhamad Ali Hamadi, who is in prison in  Germany, denied press reports that terrorist Ali 'Abbas Hamadi,  who was deported from Germany last year, has returned to Germany  to free his brother. On 21 April, Bonn security circles reported  that corresponding clues are being investigated. [passage  omitted]    On Tuesday the Arab daily AL HAYAH, which is published in  London, carried a statement of the Hamadi clan, which is very  influential in Lebanon. The statement says that reports  "according to which 'Abbas Hamadi is currently in Germany and is  secretly preparing his brother's escape from prison" are  "completely wrong." 'Abbas Hamadi is still in Lebanon and  receives medical treatment because of "the suffering he was  subjected to in German prisons."</p>

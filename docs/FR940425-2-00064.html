For example, rates of carotid endarterectomy have been found to vary widely and inexplicably across regions and States. The proposed mean assigned weight is 2.8.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. ``The economic burden posed by the prevention, diagnosis, treatment and clinical management of the health condition *&blank;*&blank;*'' is defined as the total direct and induced cost per case per year of management of a clinical condition, such as stage II breast cancer. The proposed mean assigned weight is 2.7.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. ``Aggregate cost of the use of the technology *&blank;*&blank;*'' is defined as the total direct and induced cost of the technology in question; for example, the cost of prostate specific antigen screening in males over 50 years of age, including cost of the test itself and the required followup such as transrectal ultrasound studies and transrectal needle biopsies. The proposed mean assigned weight is 2.7.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. ``The prevalence of the health condition *&blank;*&blank;*'' is defined as the number of persons with the clinical condition per 1,000 persons in the general U.S. population. The proposed mean assigned weight is 2.6.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. ``The ability of the assessment to inform ethical, social or legal issues'' is defined as the potential that the assessment has for influencing such matters. For example, AHCPR's 1990 assessment of liver transplantation demonstrated that one year survival rates following retransplant were significantly lower than for primary transplant. This information could have a bearing upon public concerns about the ethics of providing additional liver transplants to some patients, and thereby effectively denying first transplants to others on the waiting list. The proposed mean weight assigned is 1.8.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The AHCPR is not including as a criterion the availability of sufficient data. The AHCPR agrees with the IOM that data will always be inadequate in some sense, and the presence or absence of information does not affect whether, but how a technology assessment should be done; for example, a full assessment or a more limited technology review.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The AHCPR will use this proposed methodology for establishing priorities for conducting assessments pending receipt of comments and adoption of a final methodology.

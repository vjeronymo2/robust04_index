			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Lead hits two-year LME high of Dollars 625 a tonne Lead prices reached a new two-year peak on the London Metal Exchange yesterday. Its price has gone up by more than 70 per cent from the bottom of the trough in October last year,rising from USDollars 357 a tonne to Dollars 625 at one point yesterday. Lead is already the best-performing LME metal since world economic recovery began. However, buyers yesterday backed away when LME copper prices began to slide and lead for delivery in three months ended Dollars 2.50 down from Monday's close at Dollars 619. Mr Wiktor Bielski, analyst at Bain &amp; Co., pointed out that seasonal demand from the battery producers, who account for more than 70 per cent of lead demand, was helping tighten the market, as was a fall in exports from China, Russia and Kazakhstan. Mr Nick Moore, at Ord Minnett, suggested lead was on course for a 25 per cent rise from last year's average price of Dollars 529 a tonne to an average of Dollars 661 in 1994. He said: 'The fundamentals of the market continue to point to an exciting price future for lead.'  ------------------------------------------ LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS (As at Monday's close) tonnes  ------------------------------------------ Aluminium         -6,025 to 2,430,400 Aluminium alloy      -60 to    2,5860 Copper              +450 to   367,800 Lead                 +50 to   364,725 Nickel              +990 to   140,034 Zinc              +3,600 to 1,132,575 Tin                 -180 to    31,870  ------------------------------------------</p>

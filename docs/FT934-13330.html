			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / Car output growth defies forecasts CAR PRODUCTION continued to expand in September, confounding industry warnings that growth would be halted by the decline in sales of new cars in continental Europe. Although production of cars for export fell sharply, by 23.12 per cent to 46,777 compared with 60,841 last September, the total still rose last month by a further 11.89 per cent, on a year-on-year basis, to 116,046 from 103,716. Statistics issued jointly by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders and the Central Statistical Office show that production for the first three quarters of the year reached 1,043,769, up 8.48 per cent on the 962,133 for the same period last year. Output in the final quarter would have to fall well below last year's levels if industry warnings that this year's output will not exceed last year's 1,291,231 are to prove justified. While crowds flocked to the opening day of the London Motor Show yesterday, the society remained pessimistic. Mr Roger King, the society's public-affairs director, said: 'The figures might appear encouraging but the downturn within the EC and the hesitancy of the UK marketplace suggest that immediate prospects for the industry must be regarded with caution.' Production for the UK market jumped by 61.6 per cent last month to 69,269 units - attributed to a rebuilding of stocks after the annual August sales boom and to a further build-up of production by Nissan, Toyota and Honda, the Japanese carmakers. The opening of the London show has been marked by clashes between manufacturers and franchised dealers over the extent to which the seemingly buoyant market for new cars has been inflated by 'phantom' sales. The society's more gloomy view is reinforced by commercial vehicle production. This was 7.17 per cent lower last month, at 17,919, and 27.39 per cent lower for the first three quarters of the year, at 141,400.</p>

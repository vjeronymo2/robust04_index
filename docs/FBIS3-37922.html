Volskiy's  preliminary remarks have thus added weight to the professor's  private assessments.    Yevgeniy Yasin pointed to two extreme views of the two-year  experience of economic reform. The first, set forth in the  well-known report drawn up by academicians, is that Gaydar's  policy was a failure. The second, monetarist one, is that there  is a natural process under way, but the government lacks  sufficient stick-to-itiveness in pursuing a tight monetary  policy; that the state should learn to live within its means  without covering budget gaps by creating extra money.    In Yasin's view, there has been no failure of the reform  policy. The critics, Yasin said, do however fail to see  important achievements, such as the stabilization of the ruble,  which was achieved without any administrative intervention, the  Central Bank's positive refinancing rate, and the partial  redressing of price imbalances as a result of price  liberalization. The crisis cannot be overcome only by skills in  tinkering with macroeconomic indicators, he continued. The main  problem of 1994 is the reduction in inflation rates. "The  struggle against inflation is a necessary measure for any  responsible government," Yevgeniy Yasin said. Attempts to manage  the inflationary process with a monthly inflation rate standing  at 20 percent will be doomed to failure.    Among priority measures to adjust economic reform Yasin  mentioned the tightening of taxation discipline and the  government's efforts to boost private investment in the  production sector.    "We need to carry our a strategic maneuver, something Zhukov  did in the battle of Moscow -- not to squander money to patch up  holes, but to create reserves for a decisive offensive," was how  Yasin summed up his address. When asked by a director whom he  sees as suited for the role of Zhukov, he said without  hesitation: "Viktor Chernomyrdin is quite capable of lifting  the economy out of the crisis."</p>

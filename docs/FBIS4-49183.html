			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Roundup" by Wang Genbao, Chen Yong: "Syria, U.S. Discuss </F> Israeli Proposals on Peace With Syria"]    [Text] Damascus, May 1 (XINHUA) -- American Secretary of  State Warren Christopher, carrying Israeli proposals on peace  with Syria, is now in Syria trying to revive stalled  Israeli-Syrian peace talks, and is expected back in Israel with  a Syrian response tonight.    Christopher and the U.S. delegation accompanying him held  lengthy talks with Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad here Saturday  [30 April].    They also had talks Saturday with Syrian Foreign Minister  Faruq al-Shar' on ways of pushing forward the Middle East peace  process and getting the Arab-Israeli peace negotiations resumed  as well as on Israel's proposals and ideas about the peace  process.    According to diplomatic sources in the Syrian capital, the  American secretary of state conveyed to Syrian President al-Asad  a collection of Israeli ideas and proposals aimed at pushing  forward the Syrian-Israeli track of the Middle East peace  process, which started at the Madrid Conference held in October  1991.    The sources pointed out that Christopher, who had previously  met with Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and Foreign  Minister Shim'on Peres, assured the Syrian president that the  new Israeli proposals and ideas were considered serious, and  that these proposals and ideas could be developed through  bilateral negotiations between the two parties, which should be  resumed as soon as possible.    The sources revealed that the new Israeli peace plan mainly  includes the following points:    -- Withdrawing Israeli forces from the occupied Syrian Golan  Heights at three stages over eight years;    -- Establishing full diplomatic relations;    -- Setting up joint borders;    -- Establishing economic ties between the two countries  during the first stage of Israeli troops withdrawal;    -- Concluding an agreement on a set of security  arrangements that include setting up demilitarized zones on both  sides of the join borders, on condition that the one extending  to the Syrian side will be deeper than that to the Israeli side;  and    -- Stationing some U.S. troops and early-warning devices  in the occupied Syrian Golan Heights, with the aim of ensuring  the security of both countries.    The new Israeli peace plan does also include eliminating the  Israeli settlements set up on the Golan Heights.    This requires that the bilateral negotiations should be  expanded and joint military committees formed to determine the  security arrangements, and that joint economic committees should  be set up to study the question of sharing water resources in  the Golan Heights.    The sources said that the Israeli proposals and ideas are  not  only concerning the future of the Golan Heights occupied by  Israeli forces in the 1967 Middle East War and annexed to Israel  in 1981, but also include the issue of South Lebanon, whose  solution would contribute to achieving progress on both the  Syrian-Israeli and the Lebanese-Israeli tracks of the Middle  East peace process.    It was learned that Christopher showed Washington's  readiness  to dispatch a military force to ensure the security of both  parties, pointing out that the Israeli ideas could be modified  so as to fulfill the interests of both Syria and Israel.    The sources said that Syria showed readiness to get the  peace negotiations resumed in Washington, making some  reservations about the Israeli proposals and ideas, particularly  on the lack of Israel's readiness to withdraw completely from  the occupied Golan Heights.    Syria also made a reservation about the proposed Israeli  withdrawal from the Golan Heights over eight years, suggesting  that this withdrawal should be accomplished over three years at  the most, and that Israel officially announce its recognition of  Syria's complete sovereignty over the Golan Heights.    As far as the normalization of ties is concerned, Syria  prefers that a complete peace should be established and ties  should be normalized after the complete and final withdrawal of  Israeli forces from the Golan Heights.    Syria agrees to the setting up of a demilitarized zone on  the  joint borders, on condition that such areas on both sides should  be equal in size.    Syria prefers that the joint border areas should be  monitored  by UN observers, but it has no objection to American troops  operating on the joint borders within a UN peace-keeping force.    On the situation in South Lebanon, the Israeli plan includes  the following demands:    -- South Lebanon should be demilitarized;    -- The militias in South Lebanon, particularly that of the  Hezbollah (Party of God) organization, should be disarmed;    -- Israel's rights to the South Lebanon water resources  should be guaranteed;    -- The security of Jewish settlements in northern Israel  should be guaranteed;    -- Some Lebanese Army units should be stationed side by  side with a UN peace-keeping force in South Lebanon; and    -- Lebanon should sign a peace agreement with Israel in  return for the withdrawal of Israeli forces from South Lebanon.    It was learned that Syrian officials demanded that Israeli  forces withdraw completely and unconditionally from South  Lebanon in accordance with UN Security Council Resolution 425.    As regards the type of relations and normalization, Syria  prefers that this should be accomplished with a general  Arab-Israeli accord, and that what applies to Syria should apply  to Lebanon.    Christopher will leave here for Israel tonight, carrying  with  him a number of Syrian ideas and questions about the Israeli  peace plan.    These questions are believed to include how far Israeli  forces will withdraw, whether Israel is ready to withdraw  completely from the Golan Heights, whether it is ready to  shorten the period proposed by it for the withdrawal of its  forces from the Golan Heights, what guarantees will be given for  the implementation of an Israeli withdrawal within a period to  be agreed upon, and how far Israel will accept the idea of  setting up two equal demilitarized zones on the joint borders.    Although he emphasizes that the U.S. Administration is  interested in achieving peace in the Middle East, Christopher  argues that Syrian-Israeli channels should be opened and that  the peace negotiations should be resumed with the aim of  reaching a solution to fulfill the interests of both Syria and  Israel.</p>

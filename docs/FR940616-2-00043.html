You should focus on the potential environmental effects of the proposal, alternatives to the proposal (including alternative routes), and measures to avoid or lessen environmental impact. The more specific your comments, the more useful they will be.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Please follow the instructions below to ensure that your comments are received and properly recorded:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Address your letter to: Lois Cashell, Secretary, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol St. NE., Washington, DC 20426;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Reference Docket No. CP94&hyph;292&hyph;000;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Send a copy of your letter to: Mr. Steven G.

Among other things, intervenors have the right to receive copies of case-related Commission documents and filings by other intervenors. Likewise, each intervenor must provide copies of its filings to all other parties. If you want to become an intervenor you must file a Motion to Intervene according to Rule 214 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214) attached as appendix 2.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The date for filing timely motions to intervene in this proceeding has passed. Therefore, parties now seeking to file late interventions must show good cause, as required by Section 385.214(b)(3), why this time limitation should be waived. Environmental issues have been viewed as good cause for late intervention. You do not need intervenor status to have your scoping comments considered.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Additional Questions?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Additional information about the proposed project is available from Mr. Steven G.

			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / Italian coalition to back vote Italy's right-wing coalition government last night looked set to remain together in voting on a self-imposed confidence motion on part of the 1995 budget. The confidence motion had been introduced in the chamber of deputies where the coalition has a majority of 120 to ensure that the populist Northern League of Mr Umberto Bossi did not defect from the government's ranks. But as the debate began, a League spokesman told the chamber his party would back its partners even though it disliked the imposition of the confidence motion. The government's move related to the introduction of a pardon on buildings built without proper planning permission. The pardon is expected to lead to a huge influx of new property registration fees to the tune of L7,000bn (Pounds 2.76bn). But members of the government coalition, mostly the League, proposed almost 200 amendments. The opposition also proposed others to limit the scope and prevent a blanket approval for illicit construction over the past five years. Government business managers argued that only by a confidence motion could discussion be speeded up.</p>

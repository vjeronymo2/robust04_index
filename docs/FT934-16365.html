			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Oils slide A feeling that last week's advance in the oil sector following a production agreement at OPEC's had been over done, together with general profit-taking, brought a retreat for many oil stocks. The biggest decline was in BP which gave up 7 1/2 to 321p, with 5.2m shares traded. Enterprise Oil fell 8 to 468p, and Shell Transport shed 2 1/2 to 679p. In their monthly note on the sector, researchers at Strauss Turnbull said the Opec agreement was, 'a fudged compromise and not a strong agreement anyway. At best prices could hold at these levels but could easily show further weakness.' Hopes of a cut in UK base rates boosted several financial stocks. These included Gerrard &amp; National 7 up at 515p, Abbey National 10 ahead at 431p. There was switching out of Scottish Power and into National Power after SG Warburg advised clients to take profits in the former. The broker said that dividend and earnings growth at National Power were superior and recommended switching as, at yesterday's opening share prices, yields on the two shares were almost identical. Scottish, which hit its all-time high on Monday, slipped 6 1/2 to 388p in turnover of 6.3m, while National Power added 1 1/2 to 398p. Shares in British Airways gained 9 1/2 to 368 1/2 p, after traffic data for September revealed a 14.3 per cent year-on-year increase in passenger traffic. Some 6.6m shares had been dealt by the close. International mining group RTZ relinquished 7 to 675p after NatWest Securities was reported to have downgraded profit expectations. A strong drinks sector, boosted as one broker highlighted its continuing recovery potential, saw widespread gains. Bass rose 7 to 475p, Whitbread 7 to 534p and Allied Lyons 8 to 576p. Hotel-related stocks, hit last Thursday by dull results from Forte, recovered their losses. Greenalls climbed 10 to 378p, Vaux Group 6 to 248p and Forte itself 6 to 232p. Airtours gained 6 to 412p. Smith New Court upgraded the holiday group, attributed to strong late bookings for summer 1993. The broker, which remains a strong buyer, is looking for Pounds 45m profits for this year, an increase of Pounds 3m on its previous estimate. Ladbroke shook off the remnants of negative press comment and rumours to close 3 ahead at 181p. Manchester United continued to reflect its good football league form, the shares jumping 26 to 557p. Food retail shares continued their good run following further positive noises from BZW and UBS. Argyll gained 5 to 303 1/2 p, Kwik Save 11 to 679p, J Sainsbury 9 1/2 to 438p and Tesco 8 to 208p. Food manufacturer Unilever began a week of meetings with analysts, with Strauss Turnbull reiterating its buy recommendation. The shares put on 5 to 1063p. Stores stocks were generally dull, although some of the second liners took time to do some catching up. Among these, Signet, the former Ratners group, climbed 1 1/2 to 29 1/4 p, Pentos 2 to 45p and Argos 6 to 347p. Boots and WH Smith exacted further mileage from reports that they are about to impose swingeing cuts on their loss-making Do It All home improvements division. Boots added 4 to 485p and Smith 6 to 448p. Construction group Raine slipped 6 to 84p after announcing full-year profits of Pounds 10.8m against Pounds 10m, and a dividend halved to 3p. Analysts had expected profits of around Pounds 11.5m and a dividend of 4p. However, many believe that the group still has good recovery potential via the reviving housing market. RMC Group climbed 7 to 833p and Redland 9 to 565p as news of Russian stability calmed German markets where both have a vested interest. Spring Ram gained 2 to 63p on renewed speculation of a possible takeover from the US. Motors group Bostrom gained 8 to 182p. Analysts suggested a buyer had purchased a large quantityof stock since the weekend. T&amp;N bounced back 4 1/2 to 188p after conveying confidence over the outcome of its legal battle in the US. But motors specialists expect the stock to remain volatile until after the broadcasting of a BBC documentary film which is expected to repeat allegations of property related asbestos claims later this month. The poor fortunes of Wellcome puzzled many market watchers as the stock climbed 10 and then fell sharply back to close 11 down at 699p. The thin volume of 1.6m gave creedence to the belief that one sale was responsible for the decline. Also weak was Fisons which gave up 2 to 161p. Pharmaceutical analysts pinned the blame on a weak launch of its drug Tilade in the US. However, Glaxo benefited from a buy note from Hoare Govett amid generally positive sentiment surrounding the stock. It moved up 10 to 649p in a turnover of 4.1m. Hoare's Mr Nigel Barnes said that the expected aggressive dividend growth and the dispelling of some clouds over the outlook for the company meant a significant strengthening of its sentiment. The announcement that SG Warburg owns 10 per cent of the ordinary shares of Zeneca came as the stock climbed 8 to 737p.</p>

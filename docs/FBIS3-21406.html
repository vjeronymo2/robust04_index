			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Hayim Fiqarsh] </F>   [Text] The violent riots that broke out among Israeli Arabs  in the wake of the shocking massacre at the Cave of the  Patriarchs in Hebron have revealed the true face of Israel's  Arabs. When they took to the streets, they did so not merely to  express the aching grief they felt from the murder of their  brothers but also to throw stones, assault Jews, and inflict  heavy losses--by setting fire to houses, parking lots, and cars.  Some acted with loud calls for "Death to the Jews," which, for  some odd reason, were "overlooked" by Israel's state-run media.    Security forces, including police and border patrol troops,  spent long hours battling mobs of rioting Arabs even as Israeli  leftists attempted to rationalize them as "a display of  emotions" while openly stating their approval of what happened.  The Arabs of Israel, residents of the state of Israel, have  never expressed anger at or disapproval of the murder of Jews.  That may be their right. But they were obliged to restrain  themselves this time and not riot so wildly that it is almost  impossible to remember anything like it since the founding of  the state. That applies especially to the Arabs of Jaffe, who  led the disturbances, spurned calls from the police commanders  and the mayor, Roni Milo, and ran amok; they even threw tear-gas  canisters at police officers, not to mention rocks and other  dangerous objects. These are the same Arabs to whom the Jewish  community in Philadelphia, USA, has donated large sums for the  restoration of their youth clubs and renovation of their homes  as part of Project "Neighborhood Renewal." Their brothers in  Arab nations did not do that.    Like them, the Arabs of Nazareth and Ramalla, Tira and  Taibe,  like the entire Arab area of the Galilee, in the Triangle and in  Wadi 'Ara, many would have rejoiced at killing Jews if they had  not been contained by the Israeli Police, whose members, as in  Jaffe, for example, did not always display the necessary degree  of force.    It has always been necessary to deal with the Arabs of  Israel  with a policy of "respect but beware them." Some have argued  that they constitute Israel's "soft underbelly." Others complain  about the presence of a "fifth column" among a portion of  Israel's Arabs. The recent riots have strengthened that  suspicion to some extent. Indeed, people have long suspected  stores of arms and secret "firing practices" usually conducted  at night, in dry river beds and hidden caves, as preparation for  the "appointed day."    Are we gathering information about these secret  organizations? Has anyone, for example, looked into the  complaints made by residents of "Mi 'Ami," a settlement in Wadi  'Ara, about bullets whizzing past their homes and shots fired at  night, frequently outside the nearby town of Um al-Fahm? Are we  waiting for the day when these Arabs will go out not only to  exhibit their rage but also to attack Jews out of obviously  nationalist motivations? And how, as a general matter, would the  Arab-Israeli street view a future possible war?    Such a tragic event as occurred in the Cave of the  Patriarchs  was exploited by the Arabs of Israel in an extreme, dangerous,  and outrageous way. That now requires a thorough and fundamental  examination of how to treat the Arabs of Israel.</p>

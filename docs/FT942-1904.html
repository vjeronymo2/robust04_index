			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / Network plan to inform public Information 'superhighways' - advanced communications networks capable of carrying text and moving video images - are being considered as a means of disseminating official information to the public. The government yesterday published a consultation document and said it was reviewing the possibilities presented by superhighways. The report was prepared by the government's Central Computers and Telecommunications Agency for Mr William Waldegrave, the public service minister. The world's leading telecommunications and computer companies have made dramatic advances in the development of information highways. In the US, research to increase the availability and reduce the costs of the technology for government information purposes is continuing. Among the possibilities are access to government reports and statistics, access to job vacancies and checks on citizens' rights.

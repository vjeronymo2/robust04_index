			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / The Labour Party at Blackpool: Passionless divisions written in sub-clauses - Little flag-waving over Europe THERE is an old Labour tradition that party conferences should begin with a blazing row. But compared to the heroic scale of past displays of disunity, Mr Bryan Gould's resignation over Maastricht has proved but a nostalgic encore. A trawl of conference opinion in the listless atmosphere of Blackpool yesterday revealed more about how Labour has changed than about its largely passionless internal European debate. Undoubtedly, opinions on Maastricht and the leadership's approach to parliamentary Euro-tactics are divided. But they are split so diversely  - pro-Maastricht, pro-Maastricht but insistent on UK inclusion in the social chapter clauses, pro-referendum, anti-Maastricht - that the divisions appear not written in blood, but in sub-clauses. There is precious little of the flag-waving and fire and brimstone that the issues provoke among the Conservatives. An intimation of that was given by Mr Gould himself in his Sunday night address to the Labour Common Market Safeguards Committee - the tiny rump grouping, aptly anachronistic in name, that represents the party's diehard anti-Community rump. Bemoaning the 'gag and straitjacket' imposed on debate behind the closed doors of the shadow cabinet, he predicted: 'I have no illusions about how rapidly I will be disowned and marginalised about my decision to speak my mind.' Yesterday, the disowning and marginalising was already under way with many Gould sympathisers expressing ill-disguised irritation with the timing and lack of consultation behind his decision. Mr Peter Hain MP, secretary of the pro-Europe but anti-Maastricht Tribune group, suggested that outright anger was a more appropriate description of many MPs' reactions. 'Bryan acted unilaterally. He did not consult any of the people who backed him for the leadership. He's alienated a lot of people,' Mr Hain said, adding that the manner of his going had turned the debate into a discussion of the importance of unity. Even seasoned leftwingers like Mrs Maria Fyfe MP, now a Scottish spokeswoman, acknowledged that the days of conference bloodletting appear to have gone forever. 'It is not so much the party drifting to the right, it is that principles without power aren't very useful,' she said. 'Ten years ago there would have been mayhem. The party has changed.' Indeed, so much so that it can even joke about the past. Mr Robin Cook got the biggest laugh at a fringe meeting when he suggested tongue-in-cheek that, perhaps, Labour should have a referendum after all. 'It will be six months arguing amongst ourselves . . . we are good at that,' he said. If truth be told, one lasting legacy of the Kinnock years is that Labour has lost the habit. Delegates and MPs alike differed on whether Mr Ken Livingstone was right in his claim that 100 Labour MPs will oppose the Maastricht bill when it returns to the House. Many accepted that it would be more than the 59 who defied the party whip in May. But even among those ready to defy the leadership, there is little acrimony. Mr Brian Sedgemore, a one-time EC opponent, now a pro-Maastricht federalist, concluded that Mr Gould had hoped to create a wave of resistance to the party line but had signally failed to do so. 'There is no stomach for a fight over Maastricht, either in the parliamentary party, the constituencies and certainly not the trade unions,' he said. Confirmatory evidence followed soon after in the conference European debate where even Mr Tony Benn failed to stir any real inkling of a populist reaction. Although Mr Smith would still have preferred that Mr Gould's sense of timing were more tactful, some of the consequences of his coup de theatre are encouraging for the leadership. With the leading opponent of the policy gone, the shadow cabinet will now toe the line yet more rigorously than before and may yet adopt a less cautiously pro-treaty stance. The possibility of putting more space between Labour and the hesitant Conservative leadership has emerged. Within six months, the prospect of promoting Labour as the fast-lane Europeans and the Tories as the party that let Britain slip behind the leaders offers an attractive prospect. But that will require a gamble on a more explicitly pro-exchange rate mechanism stance than the Smith-Brown axis has thus far advocated. Furthermore, yesterday's crushing conference-floor defeats of those advocating a referendum will serve as powerful ammunition should the parliamentary party again attempt to persuade the shadow cabinet to pursue that route. In the end, whatever the size of the MPs rebellion in the Commons, Labour - just as Mr Smith wants - will not join the Tory right to defeat the ratification process. Undoubtedly the Conservatives will do their best to project Labour as hideously split on the European issues. But yesterday proved that the charge carries little real weight. The real disputes are about tactics. Much more worrying for the party leadership, however, is the lacklustre, downbeat mood that suffused the first day of conference. It is that air of defeatism, not the European questions, which Mr Smith must reverse when he rises to address the party today.</p>

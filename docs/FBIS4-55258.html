			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>   [Text] After a brief lull, Karadzic's media have recently  again launched an action of dismissing fear among its  subordinates. They are primarily boasting of the powerful arms  that they possess, claiming at the same time that the Muslims  have nothing, and therefore, not a chance of resisting them.  They illustrated all this with a reportage about the 2d Armored  Brigade. They showed a self-propelled howitzer, a multiple  rocket launcher, a self- propelled antiaircraft gun [words  indistinct]. The engineer boasted that they have laid thousands  of mines, a gift to their enemies, as he said. Then they showed  parts of the 27th Motorized Brigade in Derventa. The commander  boasted that the Brigade is motorized in the true sense of the  word, equipped with the most modern hardware and arms. An  inevitable question arises: Where has Karadzic got all this  from when we know that the majority of the (?500,000) residents  of the so-called Srpska republic are illiterate and that their  industry is literally at a standstill while their economy is in  tatters? Where did such modern arms, such a quantity of  ammunition, spare parts, and fuel come from? Not even many of  the more-developed countries can afford this. The answer is  clear -- [words indistinct] from Serbia.    This is not all. Analyst Karlo Jeger, on the pages of Zagreb  GLOBUS [words indistinct] the forces of the Serbian aggressor  that attacked Gorazde. Of a total of five brigades, two had  arrived from Serbia [words indistinct]. A special police  battalion from Serbia and the units of the antiaircraft defense  with the most modern rocket systems that Serbia possesses were  also there. It is clear, therefore, that there will be no end  to the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina before the borders with Serbia  and Montenegro are hermetically sealed.    Karadzic's Serbs would behave entirely differently had they  known that the potential of the former Yugoslav Peoples' Army,  [words indistinct] $200 billion, and the armed forces from  Serbia and Montenegro are no longer behind them. Many of them  would not fight a day longer, therefore, the West, if it wants  to stop the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina, must [words indistinct]  the Serbs behind the negotiating table. Participation at such  talks must also be secured for those Serbs who stayed on the  free territories or have abandoned the temporarily occupied  territories. One must not forget that they represent 60 percent  of the total number of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Serbs. Only in  this way can a just solution for all be found, that is, by  blocking the borders on the Drina and Sava Rivers and nothing  more.</p>

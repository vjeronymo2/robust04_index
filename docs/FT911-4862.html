			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / British Rail exceeds budget target by 60% THE EXTENT of British Rail's deepening financial crisis was highlighted yesterday when it emerged that BR's call on government grants and borrowings had soared beyond Pounds 1bn in the year to March 1991. BR began the financial year with a target call on government funds of Pounds 635m. That was revised in July last year to Pounds 700m, but the final figure announced yesterday was Pounds 1.016bn - exactly 60 per cent over the original budget. The figures were given by Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the transport secretary, in answer to a written parliamentary question. Mr Rifkind did not give an explanation for the overshoot, but the main factors are understood to be a downturn in passenger and freight revenues caused by the recession, a shortfall in anticipated revenues from property sales and lettings, and an upsurge in spending on safety measures. BR's call on government funds - known as the external financing limit, or EFL - is the amount it receives from the government each year to cover the gap between income and spending. Part of the EFL consists of the subsidies BR receives for operating loss-making regional railways and Network SouthEast services. The rest consists of loans from the National Loans Fund to help fund investment in the railway infrastructure. Over the last few years, a combination of buoyant property and fares income, together with a progressive reduction in subsidies for loss-making services, has resulted in a gra-dual reduction of the EFL. In the year just started, however, the EFL is set to rise still higher than last year's figure because a sharp upturn in investment spending is coinciding with a continuing downturn in revenues. BR forecasts that on current trends it will overshoot the 1991-92 EFL target of Pounds 1.122bn by Pounds 650m, and it is negotiating with the government for an increase in the figure. The government, however, is unlikely to agree to the whole of the increase sought by BR. The result is that BR will have to postpone investment and embark on a round of painful cost-cutting at a time when it is trying to improve services. The higher-than-expected EFL figure also depresses prospects for the privatisation of BR. It implies that, after three years in the late 1980s during which the corporation's non-property activities returned to profit, the losses of Pounds 46.6m on ordinary operations reported for the financial year to March 1990 are to become still worse. The InterCity operation, a prime candidate for privatisation because it made profits in 1988-89 and 1989-90, is in danger of having returned to loss in 1990-91; and the figures suggest that Network SouthEast's dependency on state subsidies is likely to continue until much later than the planned deadline of 1992-93. BR's cash shortfall is also putting the corporation at loggerheads with the rail unions because the management is using it as a justification for its refusal to meet the unions' demands in the annual pay round.</p>

			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / Money Markets: Rates little changed THERE WAS little change in London interest rates yesterday, following a firmer period earlier this week resulting from poor economic news. An improvement in the day-to-day liquidity position, after shortages in excess of Pounds 1bn on Monday and Tuesday, led to a slightly softer tone at the short end of the market. Three-month sterling interbank was unchanged at 11 7/8 -11 3/4 per cent, while 12-month money was steady at 11 7/16 -11 5/16 per cent. Short sterling futures traded in a narrow range on Liffe, as June delivery flirted with a strong technical resistance level of 88.57. Dealers warned that if this is decisively broken, then a fall to 88.35 is indicated by chart movements. The June contract opened unchanged at 88.59 and closed at 88.56. The Bank of England initially forecast a day-to-day credit shortage of Pounds 700m on the cash market, but revised this to Pounds 650m at noon and back to Pounds 700m in the afternoon. Total help of Pounds 729m was provided. Before lunch the authorities bought Pounds 312m bills outright, by way of Pounds 150m bank bills in band 1 at 11 7/8 per cent and Pounds 162m bank bills in band 2 at 11 13/16 per cent. In the afternoon another Pounds 327m bank bills were purchased in band 1 at 11 7/8 per cent. Late assistance of around Pounds 90m was also provided. Bills maturing in official hands, repayment of late assistance and a take-up of Treasury bills drained Pounds 161m, with exchequer transactions absorbing Pounds 550m and a rise in the note circulation Pounds 70m. These outweighed bank balances above target of Pounds 80m. In Frankfurt call money eased to 8.80 from 8.85 per cent after the Bundesbank injected a net DM1.5bn into the banking system at this week's securities repurchase agreement tender. The central bank accepted bids of DM12.3bn for 28-day money at a fixed rate of 8.60 per cent. This exceeded an expiring facility of DM10.8bn. In Brussels the National Bank left its seven-day advances rate unchanged at 8.80 per cent at yesterday's tender for liquidity against government paper and commercial bills. This followed a cut of 10 basis points in the rate at Monday's tender. At that time the central bank said it was eliminating a differential in short-term rates with Germany. It was regarded as a move to slow the Belgian franc's advance against the D-Mark in the European exchange rate mechanism.</p>

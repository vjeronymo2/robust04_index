			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The General Expects"] </F>   [Text] Any country, basking in the reflected glory of a  celebrated general making an outstanding success of an  international military operation, might find it difficult to  turn a deaf ear to his request for help.    Britain is rightly proud of Lieutenant-General Sir Michael  Rose, the man who has led the move from resolution to strength,  from ceasefire into separation of forces. Yet John Major  yesterday answered General Rose's plea for urgent reinforcements  with a promise of no more than 60 mortar-locating experts.    This is hardly the whole-hearted commitment to the NATO  strategy of threatening force to halt the bombardment of  Sarajevo which Mr Major was enjoining on President Yeltsin,  although the Russians appeared to have reduced the tension last  night. The Prime Minister insisted that Britain was meeting its  obligations by redeploying two units from Vitez to Sarajevo.  Britain already had over 2,300 troops in Bosnia, he said; it  was now the turn of other nations to provide reinforcements to  monitor the surrender of weapons.    It is true that Britain responded quickly to the United  Nations request for troops to protect the humanitarian convoys,  and has the second largest contingent in Bosnia after the  French. But Britain has also been consistent in its opposition  to battlefield intervention and in its refusal to sanction  either air strikes or a change in the role of UN troops.    Last week Britain lost the argument in NATO, and agreed both  to the threat of force and the de facto change in the terms of  the UN mission from peace keeping to peace enforcement. Partly  to cover its embarrassment and to demonstrate a resolution  wholly lacking in its niggardly attitude to the new NATO  strategy, the Government trumpeted its refusal to contemplate  fresh contingents for Bosnia.    General Rose wants British troops in Sarajevo because they  have proved to be among the best in Bosnia. The attempt to  secure Serb and Bosnian Government guns is the most ambitious  military task yet undertaken by UNPROFOR [UN Protective Forces],  the UN forces, demanding tact, resolution and courage as  tensions and tempers rise.    Largely because of Northern Ireland, British soldiers are  more experienced than others in dealing with terrorist warlords  and suspicious civilians; consequently they have proved  themselves outstandingly capable in Central Bosnia. Commanders  have brushed aside bureaucracy and rescued civilians. They have  broken blockades on the convoy routes. They have remained  impartial and uncorrupted.    Redeployment from Vitez will leave a gap in an area as  fought  over as Sarajevo, where aid is as short and atrocities as  common. Mr Major clearly believes that this gap should be filled  by someone else -- Belgians perhaps, or non-European countries  that might prove as effective as the Jordanians have been.    This misses the point. Countries such as Jordan cannot send  more troops because the UN is incapable of paying them. Britain  can afford to wait for reimbursement. The latest opinion poll  shows that the British public is far readier to accept air  strikes than the Government appears to be.    The American refusal to respond to the UN call confirms the  confusion and double-standards that have marked out the Clinton  Administration policy on Bosnia. The Russian decision to send  troops may be helpful in persuading the Serbs to give up their  weapons -- or it may encourage their resistance.    Britain has long prided itself as "punching above its  weight". All-round capability and a highly professional army  mean that the country remains a formidable military power, one  that has used this strength to reinforce Western values and UN  resolutions. Mr Major's refusal to respond to a call for more  troops just when their presence is most critical is yet another  demonstration of half-heartedness over the NATO decision. It is  a fudge that satisfies no one, least of all General Rose.</p>

			<p>920526 FT  26 MAY 92 / Ian Davidson on Europe: The battles are not over In the immediate aftermath of the Maastricht summit last December, there was a palpable sense of anti-climax. A great battle had been won, the new Treaty of European Union was decided, and all excitement had evaporated. Half a year on, this sense of anti-climax looks decidedly premature. Yes, the Maastricht treaty sets out an extraordinarily ambitious programme for the future development of European integration; but no, the battles are not over, the last word has not been spoken, the European Community has not reached a consensual resting place. The next phase in the never-ending struggle is just about to begin. This never-ending struggle is about the nature of the Community. This is not mainly a battle between federalists and anti-federalists, but over the competences of the Community. Is it an arrangement between free states for the purpose of organising their market economy, with occasional political forays as an optional after-thought? Or is it essentially a political association, which just happened to start out with an economic agenda for reasons of caution and commodity? The Maastricht phase of this struggle pronounced a contradictory compromise. Through Economic and Monetary Union (Emu), the Community will become increasingly federal, and thus essentially political; but its overt political agenda, of foreign and security policy, though rhetorically ambitious, is imprisoned in inter-governmental procedures which will make common action inherently difficult and infrequent. This contradiction is too lame to last. If Emu reaches its term, the participating states will have abandoned all pretension to the independent macro-management of their economies. If a single European currency is created, on a basis of monetary stability and budgetary restraint, it can hardly fail to displace the dollar as the world's pivotal currency. Is there anyone who seriously supposes that such a Community should remain hobbled and impotent in the field of foreign and security policy? Well, yes, there is such a person, and his name is Mr Malcolm Rifkind, Britain's new defence minister. In a recent speech on Europe's security policy, Mr Rifkind made clear that he does not hold with the idea. European security is Nato, the whole of Nato, and nothing but Nato; the Europeans may activate their long-dormant Western European Union (WEU) defence grouping if they like, but only as an adjunct to Nato. In all circumstances, the Europeans must first ask Nato; what Mr Rifkind means, of course, is that the Europeans must first ask the Americans. You think I exaggerate? Try this. 'The approach which the UK advocates is to sustain the clear assignment of allies' forces to Nato, while at the same time providing an ability to employ them for WEU purposes when that seems necessary. A decision to do so would require prior consultation within Nato, of course.' I just love 'of course'. The problem for the nostalgics is that Nato's treaty tasks are increasingly irrelevant to the security threats of the new world, and relevance is not improved by dreaming up new peace-keeping tasks not provided for in the treaty. Mr Rifkind implies that Nato (ie the US) should have a veto on European military action outside the Nato area and outside the responsibility of the Atlantic treaty. Yet he does not claim that Europe should have a veto next time America wants to bomb Libya or land troops in Lebanon. It is most curious. The question whether Europe should have its own foreign and security policy will not be decided by Nato, however, let alone by Mr Rifkind. But it may be critically influenced by the Community's forthcoming debate over the admission of new members. And the question will be answered by the relative balance between those countries which want a foreign and security policy, and those which do not. Not surprisingly, it is those countries which used to have a national foreign and security policy, which now want a foreign and security policy for Europe; they tend to be the large countries. The small countries long ago gave up any such thing for themselves, and are less interested in creating it for Europe. The present Community has five large countries, and seven small. Last week President Francoise Mitterrand and Chancellor Helmut Kohl strongly endorsed the membership applications of Austria, Sweden and Finland; presumably they will also endorse that of Switzerland when it is formalised. All these countries are small, and they are also, in different ways, neutral. If they are admitted, the Community will still have only five large member states; but out of 16 members, 11 will be small and five will be neutral. If this should be the future membership of the Community, there are only two possibilities. The first is that it will never acquire a European foreign and security policy, whatever the words in the Maastricht treaty. The second is that those big countries which want a foreign and security policy will have to form an inner political core or directory. In the end, even Britain will prefer the second option.</p>

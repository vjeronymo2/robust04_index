			<p>941201 FT  01 DEC 94 / Job adverts seen to exclude young Young people are excluded from applying for work in more than 40 per cent of jobs, according to a national survey of job advertisements. The independent Labour Research Department found that employers sought older employees in 8.5 per cent of 5,368 advertisements in regional newspapers across the country. A further 35 per cent of posts said that 'experience' was either required or preferred, including for jobs such as cleaning work and kitchen help.</p>

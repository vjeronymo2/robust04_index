			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / US industrial output grows Industrial production in the US rose 0.5 per cent between May and June - but the increase mostly reflected greater use of electricity with unseasonably hot weather. Excluding utilities, production rose 0.1 per cent from May, the Federal Reserve said. Overall production was 5.8 per cent higher than in June last year, having risen for 13 consecutive months. But the pace of growth has ebbed in recent months. Industrial output grew at an annual rate of 4.4 per cent during the second quarter as a whole, against 8.3 per cent in the first quarter. This mainly reflected a slowing down in car production, partly caused by capacity constraints. There were wide variations in the performance of different sectors. Production of business equipment rose 0.6 per cent from May, but output of construction supplies rose only 0.2 per cent. Mining output fell 0.5 per cent. The overall industrial operating rate rose 0.3 percentage points to 83.9 per cent last month, its highest level in five years.</p>

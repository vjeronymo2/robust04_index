			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / Only third of students find jobs ONLY a third of students funded by Lancashire County Council who left university or college last year have found jobs related to the subjects they studied, and one in eight was still unemployed after nearly a year, Ian Hamilton Fazey writes. Most who found jobs went into large public-sector organisations, East Lancashire Training and Enterprise Council's survey of people who received grants from Lancashire and sat final examinations in 1991 and 1992 has found. Unemployment was 7.5 per cent among those who qualified in 1991. Holders of Higher National Diplomas were almost twice as likely to be unemployed as those with bachelor degrees. A quarter of final-year students in 1992 went back to full-time study. Those who took medicine, science, law and business found work fastest. Unemployment was highest among graduates of art, design, mass communications and construction.</p>

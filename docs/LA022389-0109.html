			<p><P> February 23, 1989, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> REPORT SEEKS CHANGES IN TEACHING OF SCIENCE, MATH  </P> <P> There has been a chorus of warnings that the United States suffers from poor  math and science teaching. Now America's largest scientific organization has  come forward with a plan for reform.  </P> <P> Declaring that "America has no more urgent priority," the American Assn. for  the Advancement of Science envisions "sweeping changes" in the way Americans  learn science and mathematics.  </P> <P> A report, "Science for All Americans," to be released today in Washington, is  the first phase of that effort. Prepared by the National Council on Science and  Technology, which is sponsored by the science association, it lays out the kind  of education Americans will need, at minimum, to live and work effectively in  the 21st Century. Three other recent reports have already highlighted the  education deficit.  </P> <P> </P> <P> U.S. Rated Lowest  </P> <P> "A World of Differences" by the Educational Testing Service assessed 24,000  13-year-olds in six nations. It showed South Koreans leading in math skills,  followed in order by Ireland, England, Canada and Spain, with the United States  trailing. A University of Michigan survey of first- and fifth-graders in  Chicago and Beijing found Americans doing significantly worse in math than  Chinese students.  </P> <P> The National Research Council, representing the National Academies of Science  and Engineering, assessed American math education and found it seriously  wanting. Its "Everybody Counts" report warned starkly: "Wake up, America! Your  children are at risk."  </P> <P> The National Council on Science and Technology said, "It will take a shared  national vision of what Americans want their schools to achieve" to remedy this  situation.  </P> <P> That is what this new report is all about. In it, the 26 members of the  National Council recommend a common education core on which to base curriculums  from kindergarten through high school. They start by defining their educational  goal of scientific literacy. It includes:  </P> <P> * "Being familiar with the natural world and recognizing both its diversity and  its unity.  </P> <P> * "Understanding key concepts and principles of science.  </P> <P> * "Being aware of some of the important ways in which science, mathematics and  technology depend upon one another.  </P> <P> * "Knowing that science, mathematics and technology are human enterprises and  knowing what that implies about their strengths and limitations.  </P> <P> * "Having a capacity for scientific ways of thinking.  </P> <P> * "Using scientific knowledge and ways of thinking for individual and social  purposes."  </P> <P> The council wants schools to teach old subjects in new ways that emphasize the  connections rather than the boundaries between different areas of knowledge.  </P> <P> "Transformations of energy, for example, occur in physical, biological and  technological systems, and evolutionary change appears in stars, organisms and  societies," the report notes.  </P> <P> It says science education should emphasize ideas and thinking skills at the  expense of specialized vocabulary and memorized procedures. This echoes the  National Research Council's views on math education. The National Research  Council also gives priority to thinking skills and to grasping mathematical  concepts that transcend computation, which is done mostly by machines.  </P> <P> The new goal-defining report is the first phase of a long-term program called  Project 2061. That's the year Halley's comet returns. The science association  organized its National Council on Science and Technology in 1985, when the  comet last appeared, and named the program in its honor.  </P> <P> The program's second phase will develop experimental curriculums in selected  school districts over the next few years. Project director F. James Rutherford  said that San Antonio, San Diego and San Francisco districts have already  agreed to participate.  </P> <P> The final phase will be an effort extended over a decade or more to spread the  new science and math education throughout the United States.  </P> <P> The American Assn. for the Advancement of Science is an umbrella group to which  most American scientific and science education societies belong. Its  geographically and professionally diverse membership is expected to help  implement this program nationwide.  </P></p>

			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / International Company News: Lower prices push Inco into fourth-quarter deficit INCO, the world's largest nickel producer, suffered a fourth-quarter loss and an 81 per cent drop in earnings for 1991 as a whole. The setback was due mainly to lower nickel and other metal prices, and to higher production costs. But the company also spent USDollars 31m in after-tax severance costs last year. Earnings for the year as a whole were Dollars 82.6m, or 74 cents, down from Dollars 441.2m, or Dollars 4.18, in 1990. Revenues fell to Dollars 3.05bn from Dollars 3.34bn. The fourth-quarter loss was Dollars 5.8m, compared with earnings of Dollars 72.6m a year earlier. Sales and other revenues dipped to Dollars 710.3m from Dollars 870.3m. A tax benefit of Dollars 31m was recorded in the fourth quarter from the transfer of a 30 per cent interest in its subsidiary in Guatemala to the Guatemalan government. The primary metals division suffered a Dollars 5m operating loss in the fourth quarter, compared with income of Dollars 156m a year earlier. The company ascribed the loss to lower nickel, copper and precious metal prices, higher production costs, and the severance programme. Inco's unit costs rose sharply last year to an average of Dollars 2.43 per lb of nickel, from Dollars 2.15 per lb in 1990. Production costs for copper climbed to Dollars 1.58 per lb from Dollars 1.36 per lb. The company is understood to have budgeted for a much smaller increase in costs this year. Fourth-quarter nickel deliveries was almost unchanged at 125m lb, but the average realised price tumbled to Dollars 3.55 per lb from Dollars 4.31 per lb.</p>

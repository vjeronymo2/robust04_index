			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / Letter: Beware of the zappers Sir, Christopher Dunkley (Arts, June 23) does well to complain about the compilation tape beginning Wimbledon on BBC. These people seem to think we have time to waste. In Paris we watch the BBC World Service. I was horrified the other day to hear the man reading the news say: 'After the break, we will have. . .' After the break] We suffer this continually on CNN, but it has the excuse of having to fit in some advertisements. But does the BBC think we have a limited attention span? Or does the news reader get tired? We also suffer from endless compilations, complete with ineffable music, telling how good the news service is, what fine documentaries are available and what can be bought from the BBC shop. They are repeated again and again. If I see Hancock again saying: 'What do you mean May Day? This is June', I shall explode. Tell them, please, Mr Dunkley, that we are busy people; modern life is rushed; and we have zappers and will run away if they are not careful. Ken Mackenzie, 66 rue de Levis, 75017, Paris, France</p>

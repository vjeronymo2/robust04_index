			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei gains ground on late buying of blue chips AFTERNOON buying of blue chip electronics stocks boosted activity, and share prices gained ground in an otherwise quiet market, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei 225 average closed up 100.29 at 20,691.70, after a low of 20,561.59 and a high of 20,823.91 in the afternoon. The index closed off its high on arbitrage unwinding just before the close. Volume rose to 434m shares, against 382m. Gainers led losers by 578 to 427 with 174 unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks advanced 8.21 to 1,645.46 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 3.92 to 1251.73. Technical analysts said that the index saw support at the level of the five week moving average, around 20,400. A fund manager at Nippon Life, the country's largest life insurer, said that it had bought shares below the 18,000 level, and saw current prices as expensive when taking fundamentals, such as corporate earnings into consideration. US pension funds were seen buying electricals, pushing the sector up by 1.8 per cent to lead the day's winners. NEC, the most active issue of the day, rose Y30 to Y1,060 and Fujitsu gained Y35 to Y800. Mining, however, was the biggest loser, falling 1.5 per cent on lower gold prices. Mitsui Mining and Smelting fell Y12 to Y571, while Sumitomo Metal Mining fell Y30 to Y1,100. Toagosei Chemical jumped Y60 to Y700 on reports that it had developed a non-toxic pesticide, which also fertilises crops. Speculative issues gained ground on buying by short term dealers. Nippon Carbon rose Y11 to Y699. However, Nissan Motor, which was recently purchased on speculative interest, lost Y21 to Y736. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone rose Y7,000 to Y972,000, while large capital issues were mixed with Nippon Steel retreating Y1 to Y400 and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries advancing Y4 to Y716. In Osaka, the OSE average gained 128.65 to 23,063.96 in volume of 21.7m shares. Investors bought high-technology issues, while constructions and financials were also higher. Roundup THE region saw a mixture of performances yesterday driven mainly by domestic issues. HONG KONG fell back on news that China had decided not to support its currency on some of its semi-official swap markets. The news affected companies with a significant exposure to China as the yuan declined sharply. The Hang Seng index lost 53.58 to 7,322.23 in turnover of HKDollars 3.7bn against Tuesday's HKDollars 3.9bn. Stocks such as Henderson Land, New World Development and Hutchison Whampoa bore the brunt of the day's declines, due to their heavy commitment to Chinese projects. Both the SHENZHEN and SHANGHAI B share indices eased , the latter by nearly 6 per cent. SINGAPORE was led lower by declines in Cycle and Carriage. The Straits Times Industrial index fell 4.13 to 1,890.31 with Cycle and Carriage down 30 cents to SDollars 6.95. The stock has been active since last Friday's announcement that Jardine Matheson had raised its stake to 24 per cent. SEOUL was strong in pharmaceuticals on expectations that the government might provide financial support. Dong-A Pharmaceutical registered the daily limit high of Won800 to Won20,000 and Il-Yang Pharmaceutical rose Won1,000 to Won25,300. The composite index advanced 7.84 to 758.81 in turnover of Won984.9bn.

The composite index shed 7.7 to 1,572.56 in turnover of 192.2m pesos.

The composite index edged up 1.21 to 741.27 as volume slipped to 337m shares against Tuesday's 391m. JAKARTA also hit a second consecutive peak, banks rising as the JKSE index closed 4.14 higher at 345.99 in active trade. AUSTRALIA was lifted by a strong industrial sector and a recovery in the futures market. The All Ordinaries index gained 8.0 to 1,741.9. Turnover was ADollars 290.4m. The gold index fell 71.1 to 1,868.9 as the price of the commodity fell both locally and overseas.

			<p>930722 FT  22 JUL 93 / UN defends right to use force in Somalia THE United Nations will continue to use force, as necessary, to disarm the Somalia militias but recognises that the time has come for some 'fine tuning' of the operation, a UN official said last night. Responding to strong criticisms of UN tactics, particularly by Italy and Germany, Mr Kofi Annan, under-secretary general for peacekeeping worldwide, reaffirmed that the UN force 'has not detracted from its original mandate to become a military operation.' Disarmament of the Somali factions that have caused heavy UN casualties would be pursued 'forcibly' in order to create a secure environment for humanitarian aid and help rehabilitate Somalia. Mr Annan addressed delegates in New York after another official complained in Geneva about the disparity between spending on 'military protection' and humanitarian relief. Mr Jan Eliasson, UN under-secretary general for humanitarian affairs, estimated that the international community would be spending Dollars 10 on military operations in a budget of Dollars 1.5bn over 12 months for every dollar spent on relief. He said there was a risk that military actions in Mogadishu could marginalise the UN's humanitarian role. However, Mr Annan said that, for the first time, the Security Council had approved enforcement measures to achieve humanitarian goals. Only the Council could change the force mandate in response to what he termed 'the Aideed distraction' - the attacks on the UN by General Mohammed Farah Aideed's militias.</p>

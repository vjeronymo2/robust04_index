			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Croatian President Franjo Tudjman this evening  received a film personality of world acclaim -- Branko Lustig,  the producer of "Schindler's List" -- and awarded him with the  Order of Prince Trpimir. [passage omitted]    Tudjman said: As president of today's democratic state of  Croatia, I take this opportunity to apologize to you and all  members of the Jewish community on behalf of those who took part  in the Holocaust and enforced the Nazi-fascist racist laws in  the NDH [the Independent State of Croatia, a World War II Nazi  puppet-state]. At the same time, it is with pleasure that I  stress the historical truth that the large majority of the  Croatian nation condemned all types of that criminal policy, and  many Croats took an active part in the antifascist struggle,  including myself, who, as a young man fought for four years. It  is probably not a coincidence that it is a man like myself -- a  man from the ranks of the Croatian antifascist movement -- who  is leading the modern democratic Croatian state, but neither is  the fact that your hometown Osijek came under threat in our  time, and its surroundings suffered the crime of ethnic  cleansing.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Wolfgang Schaeuble, chairman of the CDU/CSU </F> Bundestag group by Paul Lersch and Klaus Wirtgen in Gengenbach;  date not given: "Strong or Weak State?"]    [Text] [DER SPIEGEL] Mr. Schaeuble, be honest: Your  senseless proposal to permit the use of the Bundeswehr for  missions at home by changing the Basic Law was intended to take  the attention from the most important issue: unemployment and  social security.    [Schaeuble] No, honestly, that is not true. The first time  I came across this issue was during the 1985 world economic  summit in Bonn. There were rumors of a possible air attack.  Only the Bundeswehr would have been able to prevent such a  strike. Yet due to the strict regulations under the Basic Law,  the Bundeswehr is not allowed to get involved in such a case.    [DER SPIEGEL] Even friends from your own party fail to  understand what made you bring up this preposterous subject in  the peaceful time before Christmas? Was it intended to sharpen  the CDU's profile?    [Schaeuble] No, I am concerned about the matter itself.    [DER SPIEGEL] You certainly knew that the necessary Basic  Law amendment would not achieve a two-thirds majority in the  parliament.    [Schaeuble] Well, I think that in the foreseeable future we  will get a decision on the framework of the Basic Law for  Bundeswehr missions. It will be a good opportunity to continue  this debate. The first reaction by the Social Democratic Party  of Germany [SPD] somewhat reminded me of the Pavlovian reflex:  When you show the dog the sausage it begins to salivate.    [DER SPIEGEL] The name of the sausage was: With this  subject Schaeuble wanted to impress friends on the right fringe.    [Schaeuble] No, not at all. There is a broad common  agreement -- this includes the SPD -- that we have to do more  for internal security, which is why I thought it important to  broach this subject in view of the beginning of a new year.    [DER SPIEGEL] Let us come back to your example of the world  economic summit. Nobody can prevent terrorists from firing  missiles at Bonn from some place -- neither the Bundeswehr, nor  the police nor the Federal Border Police.    [Schaeuble] I felt very uncomfortable at the time. Let us  take an example that is technologically less ambitious, a model  aircraft carrying explosives. Of course one could do something  against it, namely shoot down such a flying object; yet, the  Bundeswehr is not permitted to do that.    [DER SPIEGEL] Why do you not ask: How could one improve the  equipment of the Federal Border Police to enable it to deal with  such threats? You are looking for a subject that creates  controversy.    [Schaeuble] I do not see it as such. If the result of the  discussion was that more is done for the Federal Border Police  it would be a good consequence. The ridiculous thing about the  debate is that people in Germany act as if my proposal were an  axe looming over the roots of democracy.    [DER SPIEGEL] There are historical sensibilities.    [Schaeuble] One must not rule everything out from the very  beginning or regard it as taboo by pointing to special  experience from our history. I certainly do not underestimate  this objection. However, I am asking myself - particularly  regarding the Germans' historical experience -- whether it is  good to do everything differently from other countries.  Sometimes we could really adopt something from traditional  democracies. From France to America and New Zealand -- it is  possible to use military forces everywhere for missions at home  also.    [DER SPIEGEL] You have yourself mentioned an example from  the United States, namely the attack against the World Trade  Center, which was blamed on Islamic fundamentalists. The  Americans did not resort to the Army.    [Schaeuble] What is certain is that the borderline between  internal and external security can no longer be defined as  clearly as in the past. Therefore, it must be possible to  resort to the Bundeswehr as a kind of security reserve. It is  stupid to conclude from this that one should shoot at  demonstrators .    [DER SPIEGEL] During the debate on emergency laws in the era  of Christian Democratic Union [CDU] Chancellor Kiesinger the  idea was discussed to use the Bundeswehr also against  demonstrators and strikers.    [Schaeuble] I fear that the liberal democracy is threatened  once people get increasingly worried about the state no longer  being able to sufficiently guarantee their protection.    [DER SPIEGEL] Do you think that the state is too weak?    [Schaeuble] Of course one can say that the history of  Western democracies is the history of the limitation of state  powers to guarantee the freedom of the individual. That is  undoubtedly true. Yet, today I am worried that the people regard  the state as too weak and that this might constitute a danger to  freedom.    [DER SPIEGEL] So you are in favor of a strong state.    [Schaeuble] I would like to see the state as strong enough  to prevent people from thinking that they have to turn to some  kind of radical forces for shelter.    [DER SPIEGEL] None of the examples that you mentioned, not  even that of "international migratory movements," requires the  use of the Bundeswehr for missions at home.    [Schaeuble] This is a case that I took over from Polish  President Lech Walesa. He said that he would open his country's  borders in the east and west so that refugees from Russia could  travel on to the FRG. Still, I do not want to press for a  discussion on individual examples because I might then be  accused of trying to scare people.    [DER SPIEGEL] Your colleague Gerster mentioned as a first  example the "import of organized crime." Should the Bundeswehr  perhaps be used to fight crime in the future?    [Schaeuble] I think that Johannes Gerster's considerations  were correct: We must be able to respond to any conceivable  situation. And I have explicitly invited everybody to discuss  this.    [DER SPIEGEL] You have yourself said that taboos have to be  broken: using the Bundeswehr for missions at home now that  missions outside the NATO area are being tried out. The  existing consensus is thus being smashed in decisive points. Do  you want a different republic?    [Schaeuble] Certainly not.    [DER SPIEGEL] Other profound changes such as limiting the  right to asylum or bugging apartments show how the course is set  for a new direction.    [Schaeuble] I do not consider those to be profound changes.  All I want is to guarantee security for the citizens at home and  toward the outside. I think that my worries -- namely that our  efforts in this connection are rather too lax than too great --  are shared by the majority of the people.    [DER SPIEGEL] Why do you not frankly say what you want?  Maybe your demand for a strong state and your appeal to  national feelings will help you to gain the necessary support  for continuing the coalition between the CDU/Christian Social  Union [CSU] and the Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP].    [Schaeuble] You are constantly suggesting that I want a  different republic. No, I want to preserve this republic.    [DER SPIEGEL] Recent surveys do not indicate that the  citizens are impressed with your ideas: According to Emnid,  support for the CDU/CSU was 27 percent in December, which means  that is was only 4 percentage points ahead of the group of those  who said they would abstain in the election.    [Schaeuble] I can fully understand that the people are  confused; constant controversies and negotiations on every new  issue. Many Basic Law amendments are required; in the Bundesrat  there is a different majority, which is doing some awful things.  Since people are unable to see the exact difference they blame  it on the government. We must now focus on the main subjects:  the economy, the labor market, and internal and external  security.    [DER SPIEGEL] The policy you offer in these areas only  appeals to the conservative, loyal segment in your party, maybe  30 percent of the electorate. Have you stopped competing on the  SPD for the votes left of center?    [Schaeuble] I do not think very highly of a race intended to  show who is able to promise more. After all, this is not what  the great majority of people expects. The people feel that in  this difficult time we are unable to preserve all our  well-acquired rights and that they have to put up with greater  changes than those to which they have been accustomed so far.    [DER SPIEGEL] Your address to the party congress in Berlin  was clearly directed to such faithful conservative voters. You  criticized the social system and called for more patriotism and  national feeling. Is the era of a party with a broad base,  which used to range from Strauss to Bluem, over?    [Schaeuble] Do you really think that Norbert Bluem does not  share my opinion in issues such as patriotism and national  solidarity?    [DER SPIEGEL] We are thinking of the social system. This  has become obvious in the controversy over nursing-care  insurance.    [Schaeuble] Come on: We have been trying hard for years to  create the basis for nursing-care insurance at a time the  framework conditions for a further increase in labor cost do not  exist. This is what Bluem has quite rightly described as  "rebuilding." This is a much nicer word for something related  to compensation -- that is to say compensation for higher costs  on the part of the employer. Bluem's, Geissler's, and my  priority is to get nursing-care insurance now by accepting cuts  in other spheres of our social security system.    [DER SPIEGEL] Mr. Schaeuble, you are covering up the  problems of this debate. Together with the chairman of the FDP  Bundestag group, Solms, and the employers' associations you led  to a culmination of the controversy over one or two public  holidays of compensation, which almost led to the resignation of  the labor minister. Just as with the SPD, Bluem considers one  day to be enough.    [Schaeuble] What is true is that we had to make concessions  to the SPD whether we liked it or not, even though Bluem and I  were of a different opinion: We had to drop our proposal of  making people bear part of the risks themselves for continued  wage payments in case of sickness. This would have been the  correct compensation.    [DER SPIEGEL] Are you intending to foil nursing-care  insurance because of a difference of one public holiday?    [Schaeuble] Considering our weak economy the compensatory  effect of abolished public holidays regarding the cost of labor  is problematic. We opted for this path only to win the SPD's  support for nursing-care insurance. But, two days are the  absolute minimum. Besides, this does not mean that bearing parts  of the risk of continued wage payments may not be discussed  again in the next legislative term.    [DER SPIEGEL] Kurt Biedenkopf has now repeated his old  thesis and you supported him: As of the year 2020, pensions  will no longer be safe. Are you planning to bring up the  pension issue in the election campaign?    [Schaeuble] No. Bluem as well as myself are saying that the  pensions for the current generation of pensioners and those who  are near retirement age are safe. Still, politics is never made  for eternity. Considering the foreseeable demographic  developments -- more and more pensioners, fewer and fewer  working people -- we now have to think of how pensions can  remain secure and how they can be financed in a more distant  future, too. On this issue I cannot contradict Biedenkopf. Why  should one not discuss difficult and long-term problems also in  an election year?    [DER SPIEGEL] Do you agree with your colleague Volker  Ruehe who has linked the fate of this government to the way in  which it will fill the gaps in the federal budget?    [Schaeuble] If I remember correctly the 1994 budget already  passed the Bundestag.    [DER SPIEGEL] Correct. Yet, the various ministries still  have to effect 7.5 billion German marks [DM] in cuts. The  chairman of the Budget Committee, Rudi Walther, even estimates  that the gap will be DM15-20 billion. FDP officials Solms and  Lambsdorff have called for a supplementary budget and a budget  safeguarding law.    [Schaeuble] I was a Cabinet member for longer than most  current government members, which is why I know that strict  implementation of the budget can save much more than many people  will admit today.    [DER SPIEGEL] Lambsdorff has described people who make such  proposals as "fools."    [Schaeuble] I suppose that Mr. Lambsdorff just approved of  the budget. Look at the dramatic developments in the labor  market: When we devised the 1993 budget we thought that we could  do without subsidies to the Federal Labor Office. Now we need  some DM20 billion. Considering these huge amounts it does not  make any sense to use such militant arguments as Mr. Lambsdorff  likes to apply at times.    [DER SPIEGEL] The Kohl government will have to enter the  election campaign with the burden of a very large number of  unemployed.    [Schaeuble] This is why we are considering possibilities to  introduce work contracts with a time limit on a permanent basis.  We also want to break up the Federal Labor Office's monopoly in  the labor exchange in the entire FRG. What we will certainly  have to do is to examine crucial points in our transfer system:  Those who have a regular job -- even if it is only on a  temporary or seasonal basis -- must have higher incomes than an  unemployed person. This has nothing to do with social coldness,  of which I have been accused, but with the concern that the  unemployed people will accept the jobs they are offered in  Germany.    [DER SPIEGEL] Could a government reshuffle polish up the  government's image before the election?    [Schaeuble] No, not as far as I am concerned.    [DER SPIEGEL] Is it necessary to have a new face at the top?    [Schaeuble] Are you referring to the federal president when  you say "at the top?"    [DER SPIEGEL] No, we were thinking of the cabinet head.    [Schaeuble] You are familiar with my opinion: In this time,  which has become so insecure through the many changes, it is a  great asset for our country to have such an experienced,  reputable federal chancellor, who is also a strong leader.    [DER SPIEGEL] Could it not be that, in comparison to the  United States, the feeling that "it's time for a change" begins  to spread in Germany, too?    [Schaeuble] If I were in the opposition I would also bring  forth such an argument.    [DER SPIEGEL] Do you regard it as necessary that the person  who is chancellor is also party chairman?    [Schaeuble] Absolutely. In a parliamentary system in which,  for the duration of one legislative term, the government is  nothing else but the organized majority in the parliament, the  government's and the government head's leadership power is based  on the solidarity in his or her own political camp. Helmut  Schmidt today regards it as his biggest mistake not to have been  chairman of the major government partner when he became  chancellor.    [DER SPIEGEL] In your capacity as Bundestag group chairman  do you regard it as your duty to advise the chancellor to step  down if you think that this is the only way to maintain your  party's chances in the election and to save the coalition?    [Schaeuble] There is a difference between  practical-political and academic discussions. You can say a lot  about the abstract duties of Bundestag group chairmen.    [DER SPIEGEL] SPD Chairman Rudolf Scharping has said what  many other people, including CDU Bundestag deputies, think:  Schaeuble has become tougher and more embittered.    [Schaeuble] I do not see that. This was meant to hint at  the change in my living circumstances. There can be no doubt  that such an event changes one's pattern of behavior. One  begins to see many things with a greater distance. However, I  have the feeling that I have become more open for many things of  which I did not know the first before. This not only applies to  the concerns of handicapped people. I have also learned that  affection and human coexistence are much more important than  other things.    It has upset me that leading SPD officials -- Mr. Vogel was  the first one to do so in your magazine; Mr. Scharping has been  the last one thus far -- have tried to label me with a cliche.    [DER SPIEGEL] What cliche?    [Schaeuble] That a disability must embitter a person. This  is how unjustifiedly prejudice against the handicapped is being  used for political purposes. This would not only hurt me but  also run counter to my cause, namely to prove that handicapped  people can be as active in all spheres of human life and with  the same rights, responsibilities, chances, and opportunities as  people who are not disabled.    [DER SPIEGEL] Do you not have to welcome the fact that as a  handicapped person you are able to demonstrate your efficiency  in the election campaign under even more difficult conditions?    [Schaeuble] Actually, I do not have to prove anything. I am  grateful that I can make a contribution to politics with what I  am able to do.    [DER SPIEGEL] Mr. Schaeuble, thank you very much for the  interview.</p>

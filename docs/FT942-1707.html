			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / Music industry set to be cleared on CD prices The Monopolies and Mergers Commission is expected today to clear the music industry of over-charging consumers for compact discs. The commission is also expected to say that although a small group of retailers accounts for a substantial share of the market, this does not operate against the public interest. The commission report will be the second important victory for the music industry this week. On Tuesday the High Court rejected an attempt by pop star George Michael to have his recording contract with Sony declared unenforceable. The music industry feared that if George Michael had won other artists would have tried to have their contracts changed. The commission's decision on CD prices was widely expected, but retailers were uncertain whether action would be recommended against them. A finding that retailers are acting properly in selling CDs will come as a relief to the companies concerned. A report last year from the Commons national heritage committee said WH Smith, Our Price, Virgin, Woolworth, and HMV together controlled 54 per cent of music stores. In March, WH Smith, which owns Our Price, said it was merging the chain with Virgin Retail, with which it had previously had a joint venture. The commission's inquiry, launched last year, is expected to find that CD prices in the UK are the lowest in Europe. Although CDs cost more in the UK than in the US, the commission is expected to conclude that this is in line with differences in the price of other consumer goods. The commission's findings are expected to contradict a report by the Commons national heritage committee last year. The committee, under the chairmanship of Mr Gerald Kaufman, the Labour MP for Manchester Gorton, severely criticised both record companies and retailers for charging excessively high prices for CDs. The committee said that while it had 'found no evidence of formal or overt collusion, it considered that the major record companies and the retailers are effectively cartels, and indeed partly interlocking cartels'. Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, referred the music industry to the commission last May, shortly after the committee published its report. Sir Bryan said he had not been satisfied with the industry's explanations for what he saw as the high price of CDs. Sir Gordon Borrie, Sir Bryan's predecessor, had said in 1992 that CD prices reflected what consumers were prepared to pay.</p>

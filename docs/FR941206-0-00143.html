			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The total nationwide capital investment cost to TSDF owners and operators to implement the subpart CC standards is estimated by the EPA to be approximately $290 million. The total nationwide annual cost for these standards is estimated to be approximately $110 million per year. The total nationwide capital costs to hazardous waste generators of installing the required air emission controls on 90-day tanks and containers is estimated by the EPA to be approximately $23 million. Total nationwide annual cost for the 90-day tank and container controls is estimated to be approximately $7 million. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EPA concludes that the rule promulgated today will not have a significant economic impact on hazardous waste generators or TSDF owners and operators. Prices for commercial hazardous waste management services are estimated by the EPA to increase by less than 1 percent on a nationwide annualized basis. The quantity of hazardous waste handled by commercial hazardous waste management companies is projected to be reduced by less than 1 percent on a nationwide annualized basis. Few, if any, facility closures are anticipated. Job losses in the hazardous waste industry are estimated to be less than 1.5 percent. Furthermore, this impact on employment does not reflect positive employment effects on industries producing the air emission control equipment that will be used to comply with the rule. No significant impacts are expected on small businesses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Implementation of RCRA Section 3004(n) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 added section 3004(n) to RCRA. Section 3004(n) directs the EPA to promulgate regulations for the monitoring and control of air emissions from TSDF as may be necessary to protect human health and the environment. The EPA completed the first phase of its regulatory development program to implement this Congressional directive with the promulgation of RCRA air standards that control organic emissions vented from certain hazardous waste treatment processes (i.e., distillation, fractionation, thin-film evaporation, solvent extraction, steam stripping, and air stripping) as well as from leaks in certain ancillary equipment used for hazardous waste management processes (55 FR 25454, June 21, 1990). Today's action completes the second phase of the EPA's regulatory development program with the promulgation of RCRA air standards for tanks, surface impoundments, containers, and miscellaneous units operated at TSDF. This rulemaking also adds air emission control requirements for certain hazardous waste generators accumulating waste on-site in RCRA permit-exempt tanks and containers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> June 4, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ON VIEW: CHILDREN'S BENEFITS CHOOSE 'PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' THEME  </P> <P> Every seat from the orchestra to the balcony was paid for and filled for  Childrens Hospital of Los Angeles' Phantom Gala -- weeks ahead. Because the  committee held costs to $19 per person, the net will be a hefty $287,000.  </P> <P> From the beginning it was to be an all-heart, no-glitz evening, a family night  at the Music Center. And there were families by the droves. William and Onnalee  Doheny and Will and Libby Doheny organized 48 seats for a triple-generation  celebration. Stephen and Louise Griffith flew in their offspring from New York  because they hadn't been able to get "Phantom of the Opera" tickets there.  Eleanor Griffin came with her grandson, Warren Techentin. Dody and Otis Booth  brought her daughter, Ashley Brittingham. Jeff and Isabel Arnett led a troop.  </P> <P> At intermission it was like an old-time ice cream social -- no ice cream, but  plenty of strawberries, Phantom-masked in white and dark chocolate, almond  truffles and pecan cookies served on silver trays by waiters -- all planned by  Bonnie McClure, Susan Miller and Jan Shortz.  </P> <P> Not that anyone was hungry. Pre-performance there were dozens of groups at the  California Club. Childrens Hospital chairman Dr. Richard Call and his wife,  Nancy, were surrounded by Kate and Joe Regan, Nancy and Ray McCullough and  Leslie and Jim Thompson. Elsewhere in the Fireside Room, Anne Wilson and Camron  Cooper hosted friends.  </P> <P> In Toluca Lake, hospital board member Sid Petersen and Nancy invited three  tables of guests for dinner before the show and trimmed up the house with some  of the 1,900 black masks that were mailed last December to CHLA ticket buyers.  Over at Engine Company 28 on Figueroa, Pam and Peter Mullin were the happy  hosts.  </P> <P> Mostly it was a cheery evening. Nancy Burrows, a theater lover, however, was  overcome by the performance, a situation that did little for her mascara.  </P> <P> CHIPPING IN: A night earlier, the CHIPS (Colleague Helpers in Philanthropic  Service) asked Betsy Bloomingdale to be honorary chairman for their "Phantom"  benefit. Easily, they produced a $125,000 night to benefit Children's Institute  International which serves abused children.  </P> <P> Marcia Wilson Hobbs, there with her mother and father, William and Betty  Wilson, takes over the CHIPS presidency. She was getting congratulations from  president Isabel Leahey; benefit chairs Lisa Bloomingdale Bell and Nancy  Wibblesman; and Mary Emmons, executive director of the Childrens Institute  International. More in the crowd were Beverly Morsey, Jane and Craig Gosden,  Marjorie Miller, Barbara and Marvin Davis and Natalie and Gwynn Robinson.  </P> <P> JOIN THE THRONG: Amie Karen Cancer Fund has announced the founding of Rainbow  II, a group of professionals to generate new community interest and to assist  the Rainbow Women's Guild in fund-raising for Camp Rainbow and the Amie Karen  Center for Treatment of Children with Cancer at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center.  </P> <P> SUCCESS: "We dedicate this evening to you," Pepperdine University president  David Davenport told Pepperdine Associates after campaign co-chairman Leonard  Straus announced at the Beverly Hilton that the $100 million "Wave of  Excellence" campaign had exceeded its goal with $134.5 million.  </P> <P> ESCALATION: Anne and Kirk Douglas were saluted with the Jacoby Award from the  UCLA International Student Center at a dinner at the Beverly Wilshire . . .  </P> <P> Honorary chairs Sybil Brand, Cindy Chapman, Tanna Havlick, Susan Hook,  Christine Huenergardt, Ellie Hustedt and Pat O'Connell were honored at tea --  fanfare before the sixth annual Celebrity Fashion Show to benefit cystic  fibrosis Saturday at the Sheraton Universal.  </P> <P> KUDOS: To the Friends of the Visiting Nurse Foundation of Los Angeles,  observing a 50th anniversary of home health care today at the home of USC  president James and Marilyn Zumberge in San Marino . . .  </P> <P> To Donald T. Sterling, Los Angeles Clippers owner, hosting champagne and caviar  at his Beverly Hills estate for 500 sports/civic leaders, including Sherry  Lansing, United Way president Leo Cornelius and MCA Music president Irving  Azoff . . .  </P> <P> To the Streisand Foundation, granting $250,000 to the Environmental Defense  Fund to endow the Barbra Streisand Global Atmospheric Change Chair; it will  support the work of Michael Oppenheimer, Ph.D., director of the EDF Global  Atmosphere Program . . .  </P> <P> PAST PERFECT: Pearl Bailey, special adviser to the U.S. mission to the United  Nations, philosophized -- "Some times are gonna be sweet and some times are  gonna be sour, but you just gotta learn to swallow" -- as she compared her ups  and downs to those of Israel, and after she received the Hebrew University  Golda Meir Fellowship Award in an emotional ceremony at the Hebrew University  Women's Committee Builders of Scopus dinner at Chasen's.  </P></p>

			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / Slaughters heads takeover league Slaughter and May has been the leading law firm advising in public takeovers in the first half of this year, it emerged yesterday. The firm advised companies or financial advisers in five deals worth Pounds 1.63bn, according to Acquisitions Monthly magazine, which ranks law firms by the value of the takeovers in which they have acted as advisers. Among the deals which enabled Slaughters to top the league table was the Granada Group's Pounds 766m takeover of London Weekend Television, when the law firm acted for LWT. Slaughter's also represented Westland in its acquisition by GKN. Ashurst Morris Crisp took second place in the table, having worked on three deals worth Pounds 1.1bn. These included acting for MAI in its takeover of Anglia Television. The firm has worked closely with the banking world and two deals worth Pounds 780m pushed it to the top of the table of legal advisers acting for financial advisers. The statistics again show the continued domination of the leading national law firms. The strength of regional firms is demonstrated by Birmingham-based Wragge &amp; Co appearing in the table for the first time, ranked tenth. The firm participated in two deals worth Pounds 92m. Slaughters was also the leading adviser on private takeovers in the January to June period. It acted in 24 deals worth Pounds 2.87bn. Among these were the Pounds 1.5bn sale of the Rover Group to BMW. Linklaters &amp; Paines was second in the private takeovers table, advising in 16 bids which were worth Pounds 2.1bn. Norton Rose was third with six deals totalling Pounds 1.6bn. According to the magazine most lawyers in the mergers and acquisitions market are quietly confident that the level of business will be sustained for the rest of the year.  ------------------------------------------- Advisors Top Ten  ------------------------------------------- Law Firm                    No of     Value                             deals (Pounds m)  ------------------------------------------- 1  Slaughter and May           5      1,636 2  Ashurst Morris Crisp        3      1,063 3  Lovell White Durrant        2        768 4  Clifford Chance             5        757 5  Freshfields                 3        608 6  Linklaters &amp; Paines         6        383 7  Macfarlanes                 3        199 8  Norton Rose                 2        153 9  Travers Smith Braithwaite   2        130 10 Wragge                      2         92  ------------------------------------------- Ranked by value of transactions based on completed aand failed offers for UK public companies and including only those advisors involved in two or more transactions  ------------------------------------------- Source: Acquisitions Monthly  -------------------------------------------</p>

			<p><P> January 24, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO;  </P> <P> 5 NAMED TO GROUP FOR OPEN SPACE BOND  </P> <P> A former mayor and four city commissioners have been named to a residents'  committee lobbying to preserve open space through a general obligation bond  scheduled for the April ballot.  </P> <P> Roy Byrnes, who served as mayor from 1973-75, will head fund raising for San  Juan Citizens for Open Space.  </P> <P> Joining Byrnes on a steering committee for the group are Planning Commissioners  Gil Jones and Wyatt Hart, and Parks and Recreation Commissioners Terry Dorse  and Pauline Leonard. Also serving on the committee are community activists Al  Aarps, Wilson Buckner, Mike Darnold, local Little League president Vickee  Donoho, Stan Holditch and Gail Prothero. Capistrano Unified School District  Trustee Marlene Draper is chairwoman of the grass-roots organization.  </P> <P> The $21-million general obligation bond would be used to buy 120 acres of  farmland in the north end of the city. Officials envision the land as a public  recreation area that would include orange groves, a community center, bicycle  trails and playing fields.  </P> <P> The referendum, which will cost the city $23,000, is scheduled for the April 10  ballot. The measure needs a two-thirds vote to pass. WENDY PAULSON  </P></p>

			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / Lord Ridley: Firebrand champion and defender of the Thatcherite faith - Obituary LORD RIDLEY of Liddesdale, the zealous promoter of Thatcherism who died yesterday, was lauded by Baroness Thatcher, former prime minister, as 'a great Englishman'. He would have been equally honoured, perhaps privately, to have been called a bad European. The former secretary of state for transport, environment, and trade and industry as well as intellectual confidant of Mrs Margaret Thatcher - as she was then - was a nationalist, bogey man of Brussels and scourge of socialism. His vision was of a wider, looser free-market Europe. He was an unrepentant opponent of Maastricht who staggered into the House of Lords on his 64th birthday two weeks ago for a last denouncement of the treaty and European integration. A heavy smoker, he had been ill for some months. As Mr Nicholas Ridley, his ministerial career ended in 1990 when he dubbed the European Community 'a German racket designed to take over the whole of Europe'. The loss is greatest for the defenders of the Thatcherite legacy. His stamp is indelible. But in his unbridled enthusiasm he also sowed some of the seeds of its eventual destruction. There was an academic rigour but, unlike Mrs Thatcher, he had less of an appreciation of the need to bow or bend sometimes according to prevailing political practicalities. Lord Ridley introduced the poll tax, attacking its detractors by saying: 'Why should a duke pay more than a dustman?' He arrived at the Department of Trade and Industry to ask: 'What is this department for?' Prior to Mrs Thatcher's election as prime minister in 1979 he plotted ways of taking on the coal-miners. He steered through the privatisation of British Airways and the water industry. He represented the constituency of Cirencester and Tewkesbury for more than 30 years until he retired at the April 1992 election. For Mr John Major he was no close friend. When both were in the cabinet  - the prime minister was then chancellor - Mr Ridley waged a relentless, but ultimately unsuccessful, battle against British membership of the exchange rate mechanism. In typical maverick form Lord Ridley used a last article for The Times on Wednesday to suggest a higher 50p rate of income tax and the abolition of the ceiling on National Insurance contributions - strikingly close to Labour party policies at the last election. It was magnanimous of the prime minister to describe Lord Ridley yesterday as inspiring 'great affection among those who worked closely with him'. Sir Norman Fowler, Conservative party chairman whose views on Europe are strictly Majorite, described him as 'one of the big characters in British politics'. Lord Ridley was a more complex character than the brash image he appeared to cultivate. He could be personally unpleasant - particularly to journalists. He had an arrogance perhaps borne of long experience. On the Tory benches there were admirers more than friends. He was a bruiser  -albeit with more grace than Lord Tebbit, the former party chairman who has also joined the anti-Maastricht crusade. But in private there was a different character. Civil servants liked his wit, decisiveness and ability to delegate. He was a tall, gaunt character with a sense of propriety. He regarded it as his duty in the Commons to take the flak - as he did in generous quantities over, say, his refusal to act against the Fayed brothers after a damning DTI report on their takeover of Harrods. An amateur artist, Lord Ridley liked to paint in bright colours. In the world of politics he was similarly bold, sometimes betraying a naive understanding of political correctness. His comments on Germany and the European Community, in a Spectator magazine interview, were only the most blatant example. He missed life in political office, and pined for the Thatcher years, but could at least claim that he went down fighting.</p>

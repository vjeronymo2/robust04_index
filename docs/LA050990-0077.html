			<p><P> May 9, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> DAWSON PUTS CUBS BACK IN SWING  </P> <P> The tendency at Wrigley Field, especially when the wind is blowing out, is to  overswing.  </P> <P> Andre Dawson, who has a chronic back problem, can't afford that.  </P> <P> So the Cubs' 35-year-old right fielder resisted temptation Tuesday afternoon  with gusts of 25-m.p.h. blowing out.  </P> <P> The result was Dawson's home run into the center-field seats to tie the score  in the ninth inning, then a two-run blast in almost the same place with one out  in the 11th to help give the Cubs a 10-8 victory over the Atlanta Braves.  </P> <P> "I tried not to pull the ball and just hit it right down the middle," Dawson  told the Associated Press. "I had to remember to stay back on the ball. They  have been throwing me a lot of off-speed pitches, and I've been fouling them  back."  </P> <P> The Cubs were in a mood to celebrate after ending a three-game losing streak  with only their fourth win in 12 home games. After blowing a four-run lead and  losing Monday night, they wasted a 5-0 margin before storming back in this one.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the Braves hit three home runs, and the wind turned some routine fly  balls into adventures.  </P> <P> The luck of Tom Glavine, the top left-hander of the Braves, continued to be  poor. An error by right fielder Dale Murphy helped the Cubs score five unearned  runs in the first inning.  </P> <P> But the Braves, who scored only 12 runs in his previous five starts, fought  back to take a 7-6 lead in the eighth. Then the bullpen couldn't hold it.  </P> <P> "The way we've been struggling lately, I thought we were in the seventh game of  the World Series when Andre hit the one in the 11th," Cub Manager Don Zimmer  said.  </P> <P> Pittsburgh 10, San Diego 2 -- After taking over first place during a recent  13-game trip, the Pirates finally are playing better at home.  </P> <P> Mike LaValliere and Andy Van Slyke each hit a home run and drove in three runs  when the Pirates defeated the Padres for their fourth victory in a row at  Pittsburgh.  </P> <P> Walt Terrell, signed as a free agent last winter, gave up two runs in the  first, but the Pirates' 16-hit attack and four double plays gave him his first  victory as a Pirate.  </P> <P> Eric Show (0-4) failed to make it through the second inning, giving up four  runs and five hits.  </P> <P> Barry Bonds, a .600 hitter against the Padres, singled in two runs to tie it in  the first. Van Slyke is batting .563 against the Padres.  </P> <P> The Pirates, with an 18-8 record, lead the Eastern Division by 3 1/2 games over  Montreal.  </P> <P> New York 4, San Francisco 1 -- The Giants, desperate for effective pitching,  started Rick Reuschel, who will be 41 next week, at New York with only three  days' rest.  </P> <P> The veteran right-hander was doing very well until, with two out in the seventh  inning, he walked Kevin McReynolds with the bases loaded to break a 1-1 tie.  </P> <P> The Mets scored two more in the eighth to win their fourth in a row. The Mets  are beginning to play good ball, but they aren't gaining on the surprising  Pirates.  </P> <P> Kevin Mitchell hit a 430-foot home run in the fourth inning for the Giants'  run. It was the seventh home run for Mitchell, who led the majors in home runs  last season with 47. Saturday in Montreal, he hit a 462-foot home run.  </P> <P> Sid Fernandez (2-3) gave up only three hits other than Mitchell's homer in  seven innings, and John Franco picked up his seventh save.  </P> <P> Houston 3, Philadelphia 2 -- Rafael Ramirez doubled home the winning run in the  10th inning at Houston.  </P> <P> Eric Yelding opened the extra inning with a single to right and stole second.  Ramirez lined the ball over the head of left fielder Randy Ready and Yelding  scored without a play.  </P> <P> The Phillies missed several opportunities to win it. In the seventh, Astro  right fielder Glenn Wilson threw out Curt Ford at the plate to end the inning.  </P> <P> In the 10th, Ready tried to score the go-ahead run but missed home plate and  was tagged out.

			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / Survey of Global Custody (7): Braced for radical changes - Settlement The City of London's stock lenders and borrowers are braced for a series of significant changes to their business over the next 18 months, as the London Stock Exchange moves to modernise the share dealing mechanism. Under the present system, UK market makers - who quote prices to buy and sell shares on the London market - have two weeks to settle their accounts and deliver the stock to clients. If they have a deficiency of stock to fulfil an order, they will normally borrow the balance from one of eight Bank of England-authorised money broking houses. These in turn borrow the stock from institutions, such as a pension fund or insurance company, which are recognised by the Inland Revenue. Both the institution and money broker charge a fee for their services, the size of which is dependent on the size and value of the trade, and the duration of the loan. However, in a series of radical changes, the settlement system moves to a 10-day rolling account period next July. By January 1995, the plan is to move to five-day settlement. A year later the Crest paperless settlement system will be introduced. The impact on the three participants of the stock lending process - market maker, money broker and institution - of these changes are still being debated, both by the Bank of England working party preparing the way for the new system, and by the dozens of City firms and institutions involved in the Pounds 2bn-a-day business. The most important change will be the increase in the number of transactions. Instead of settling their books every two weeks, as now, under the new rolling system market makers will settle on a daily basis. For their part, money brokers will have to borrow from the institutions and lend to market makers more frequently. 'Every day will be account day from July,' says Mr Luby Sparber, head of settlements, at Smith New Court. 'Market makers will have to run their positions more tightly and for shorter durations. If they don't it will increase the carrying costs.' Just how much more business will be created under the new rolling system is the subject of much speculation in market circles. An internal study by one stockbroking firm estimated that the amount of stock lending could increase between five and six times. The Bank of England, which has had access to the dozens of internal broker and institutional studies, suggests a doubling of the number of transactions more likely. Most observers say the need for more stock should not be a problem at these forecast levels. Mr Dick Vesy, at Lloyds Global Custody, says: 'I believe that in absolute terms there is enough stock to satisfy a large increase in requirements, even by a factor of four or five, but only if the demand is allowed to draw out the price sufficiently to attract more suppliers. Some of the institutions may not come in without more money.' The level of increase in transactions will be crucial to the degree to which fees harden. One money broker executive admits: 'The margins for both brokers and institutions have gone down in the last two or three years because there's been too many lenders. Fees will go up, and any increase after rolling settlement will help redress the balance.' Typically, a money broker will calculate the fee for a trade with a marketmaker as follows: the size of the loan (ie the number of shares) multiplied by the share price, mulitplied by the basis rate (usually around 50 points) and divided by 36,500. This gives a daily rate and is then mulitplied by the duration of the loan. The institution will be paid a fee by the money broker of just under half of that received from the market maker. The likelihood of greater volumes in stock lending have also given rise to fears over the extra amount of paperwork that will be generated and the present system's ability to cope prior to the Crest paperless system taking over. One solution that may develop is for market makers to help each other to balance their books at the end of each day's trading. This would only apply to smaller trades, but would considerably reduce the amount of paperwork from the rolling settlement system. The Bank of England has also commissioned a sophisticated computer model of the stock lending process in an attempt to identify potential bottlenecks. Various areas for improvement are being examined, including introducing a code of practice for the registrars, and reducing the movement of share certificates, particularly where the value of the loan is considerably less than the certificates' face value. 'There is a lot of slack to be taken up,' says Mr Iain Saville, who heads the Crest project at the Bank. 'We are confident that savings can be made to make the system operate more efficiently.' There has been some pressure to make more radical changes to the system, mostly from the market-making side. One leading market maker says: 'The proposed changes simply bring us into line with other countries' systems. But the mechanism's still too restrictive. It inhibits arbitrage and puts obstacles in people's way. There's a huge pool of outside investors who see the UK market as overvalued and who'd like the opportunity to short it. There's a groundswell of opinion that London should get in step with the rest of the world's markets.' Supporters of the changes say that the uniqueness of the quote-driven system underpins the success of the stock lending business. The Bank of England believes that 'the planned changes for stock lending in London will facilitate marketmakers in providing an excellent quote-driven system with liquidity. This will be extremely good not only in the absolute but also by international standards.'</p>

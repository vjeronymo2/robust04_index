			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / Arts: Return of the 'Screw' Since it was seen first at the English National Opera 13 years ago, Jonathan Miller's staging of Britten's Henry James opera has always commanded admiration. In this latest revival by David Ritch, nothing seems second-hand or dated. The current fascination with child abuse prompts new frissons, perhaps, as no doubt does the popular 'revelation' of the composer's shy faiblesse for boys with unbroken voices. But the production here makes no sticky capital of those; in its (partly new) cast, it has all the capital it needs. In David Hersey's lighting (reproduced by Neville Currier), the designs by Patrick Robertson and Rosemary Vercoe still look faultlessly apt: shadowy projections of country-house views upon a quasi-Japanese structure of pale screens, casting disoriented perspectives beyond them. In the pit James Holmes conducts his first-rate small ensemble to searching, vigorous purpose. There is no longueur. As the haunted children Miles and Flora, 12-year-old Samuel Burkey again offers tight little smiles that suggest inner stresses, and Megan Davis - new to the cast, but much older - captures sinister pubescent mischief with uncanny success. Like their elders, they play with a subtlety rare on a big stage like the ENO's, and they sing in consistent character. Christine Bunning repeats her vampirish Miss Jessel, a delectable study in ruined allure. Philip Langridge returns as the abuser from beyond the grave, Peter Quint, imperious and ambiguous, with a copper-coloured mane and trenchant, transparent diction. That latter virtue also makes his new doubling as Narrator a superb prologue to the piece, every word steeped in unspoken forebodings. This will be no surprise to regular opera-goers, who are well aware that Langridge is now at the remarkable peak of his operatic prime. There is a fine new Mrs Grose from Mary Lloyd Davies, who projects conviction and looks utterly to the manor born, a model of trim, homely decency. Toward the end, after her sleepless night hearing Flora's ghastly dream-confessions, I thought she looked under-harrowed - but the style of this Turn of the Screw does not accommodate raw scarification. Neither did Valerie Masterson's new Governess reel much at the final catastrophe, which left her 'Malo' lullaby with less wrenching Affekt than it wants. This well-loved soprano wields such tremulous, nerve-end poise, however, and such vulnerable beauty and frailty, as to make her already unforgettable in the role. It is her first operatic entry into Britten, and a perfect choice. On the first night, the ensembles were not yet in perfect focus; when they are, and Miss Masterson can bestride them with full dramatic authority, she will be more memorable still. Coliseum: Saturday, then February 2 and 4</p>

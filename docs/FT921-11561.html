			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / National Savings wins praise THE NATIONAL Audit Office has given the Department of National Savings a virtually clean bill of health in its latest report to the Committee of Public Accounts. The NAO said that the department's arrangements for staff planning and work measurement were recognised to be generally good, but further improvements in information systems would help managers to control resources. National Savings products are sold through the Post Office network and the NAO that there was no independent way to determine whether the fee paid by the National Savings Department for the service - Pounds 50.77m in 1990-91 - was fair and reasonable. The NAO believes that periodic independent consumer surveys could help in planning the development of National Savings products. National Audit office, report by the Comptroller and Auditor General. To be published as House of Commons paper 187. HMSO. Pounds 7.80.</p>

			<p><P> July 1, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TOUCHED BY THE 'BOSS'  </P> <P> I was deeply touched by the March 13 episode of "Who's the Boss?," especially  the scene in which Mona is in the hospital and her deceased husband appears,  telling her of his love. I recently lost my husband of 42 years, and those were  his last words to me before passing away. My compliments to the writers for  such sensitivity and to Katherine Helmond for her warm portrayal.  </P> <P> Rose Canevari, Temecula  </P></p>

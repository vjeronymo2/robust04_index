			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / Ford extends Christmas shutdown Thousands of workers at the Ford Motor Company are being forced to start their Christmas holiday earlier than usual because of falling demand for its products in continental Europe. Today will be the last production day for Ford assembly workers at the Dagenham works in east London except for those working in the engine plant. This will mean a loss of 13 shifts over seven days. Production will not restart at Dagenham until January 5. The company said yesterday that the early shutdown was partly caused by plans to carry out changes to the production lines to improve the safety of Fiesta vehicles. Workers at the company's Halewood plant on Merseyside will not work tomorrow or on Friday, in line with the three-day working that started last month. At Southampton and Bridgend workers are also being compelled to take more shifts off this week in addition to their Christmas break. Although the workers will be paid basic rates during the break they will lose shift premiums and bonuses during the extra six days off work. It is estimated this will mean a cut of 10 per cent in pre-Christmas earnings for many of Ford's manual workers. Mr Jimmy Airlie, chief Ford negotiator for the AEEU engineering and electrical union, said: 'Ford's action reflects economic realities. Britain is still deep in recession.' At Vauxhall's Luton plant the production line will stop for an extra four days after the December 22 to January 4 break, restarting on January 10. The company's Ellesmere Port plant will return to operation on January 4. The Rover Group and Peugeot Talbot said yesterday that they would be taking a normal Christmas holiday - from Christmas Eve until January 3. Sales of Rolls-Royce and Bentley cars are unlikely to exceed 1,500 a year - compared with a peak of 3,333 in 1990 - 'for the foreseeable future', Mr Michael Donovan, commercial managing director of the Vickers-owned carmaker, said. But with the company's break-even output, including big provision for research and development, down to 1,300, it is viable, he said. Mr Donovan said that the prediction made in the summer by Sir Colin Chandler, Vickers' chief executive, that Rolls-Royce would return to profitability this year - after running up total pre-tax losses of Pounds 110m in 1991 and 1992 - was being borne out by the level of year-end sales. He said Rolls-Royce's financial performance was being boosted strongly by the unexpected success of the Pounds 170,000 Bentley Continental coupe model. Sir Colin has said that in the long term Rolls-Royce would need to find some form of partnership to develop a new generation of models.</p>

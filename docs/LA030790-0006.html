			<p><P> March 7, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> FAKE OIL SPILL TO TEST RESPONSE  </P> <P> In the wake of the Long Beach oil spill, Coast Guard officials have decided to  stage a 5-hour drill Thursday in San Diego waters to test the local response to  a similar event.  </P> <P> For the drill, scheduled to begin at 9 a.m. near the entrance to San Diego Bay,  the Coast Guard will team with the Navy and an industry-supported spill  clean-up group called Clean Coastal Waters.  </P> <P> The groups will deploy oil containment booms and skimming equipment in response  to a simulated spill of fuel oil spewing from an imaginary boat grounded near  the Zuniga jetty.  </P> <P> Officials will evaluate the groups' response, how effectively they communicate  with one another, and how efficiently they use the equipment.  </P> <P> "We will test the people and the equipment to see how well the response  community will be able to work in case there were a spill here," said Coast  Guard Lt. Stephen LaLonde.  </P></p>

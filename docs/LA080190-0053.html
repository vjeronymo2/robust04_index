			<p><P> August 1, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> ORIOLES' BIG GUY IS HELPING IN BIG MOVE  </P> <P> The Baltimore Orioles are making an impressive effort to assure a three-team  battle for the pennant in the American League East.  </P> <P> They might have just the man to lead them in 6-foot-7 right-hander Ben  McDonald.  </P> <P> At a time when big pitchers are the vogue, McDonald is the newest sensation.  </P> <P> McDonald, in his third major league start, turned in his third sharp  performance Tuesday night at Baltimore in a 6-4 victory over Toronto.  </P> <P> McDonald went seven innings, giving up seven hits, but only two of the runs  were earned. The loss dropped the Blue Jays into a tie with Boston for first  place. The Orioles are four games behind.  </P> <P> Cal Ripken hit a three-run home run in the first inning and gave the Orioles  the lead for good.  </P> <P> It was not all that long ago that there was a place for 5-6 Bobby Shantz and  5-8 Elroy Face. Those days are long gone. Scouts are looking for pitchers 6-4  or taller.  </P> <P> Bill Utterback of the Pittsburgh Press reported that there more than 20  pitchers 6-4 in the majors this season who are showing winning form.  Collectively they were posting a percentage of better than .700. That was  before McDonald.  </P> <P> In his second start last Friday McDonald beat the Kansas City Royals. He drew  lavish praise from George Brett, a foremost authority on pitchers.  </P> <P> "That's the best stuff I've seen all year," Brett said after facing the big  youngster. "I hope that was exceptional stuff for him and not so-so stuff. If  that was an average night for him, a lot of hitters in this league are in  trouble. He's already proven he's good by shutting out the White Sox. They're a  good hitting team."  </P> <P> The Orioles have the best record in the league since the All-Star break. They  finished July with a 17-11 record.  </P> <P> Boston 7, Chicago 2 -- Manager Joe Morgan tried just about everything to get  his hitters out of a slump. For the most part nothing worked and the Red Sox  fell out of first place in the East.  </P> <P> At last, he seems to have found a solution. He moved Wade Boggs, often derided  for lack of run-producing despite a high average, to the No. 3 spot in the  order.  </P> <P> In the last three games Boggs has delivered one key hit after another. The Red  Sox have won three in a row and Boggs is eight for 14. He has driven in six  runs and scored three.  </P> <P> He was three for five with an RBI in this game at Boston.  </P> <P> Tom Brunansky and Tony Pena, came out of prolonged slumps in a four-run second  inning that put the Red Sox in command.  </P> <P> Brunansky was zero for 34 before he got the first of three singles, while Pena  was one for 23 before he singled.  </P> <P> Dana Kiecker (4-1) allowed only one baserunner until one was out in the sixth,  then was chased without retiring another batter.  </P> <P> Seattle 7, Oakland 2 -- Bill Swift blanked the Athletics for eight innings at  Oakland to win his third start in a row.  </P> <P> Despite the defeat the A's remained three games ahead of Chicago in the West.  </P> <P> Mike Moore (9-10), the former Mariner, is 0-2 with an ERA of 8.41 in four  starts against Seattle. He didn't make it through the fifth inning.  </P> <P> Kansas City 8, Cleveland 4 -- The Royals lost the hot-hitting Brett for a few  days, but welcomed back another hitter, Danny Tartabull, at Cleveland.  </P> <P> Tartabull, just off the disabled list, hit two of the Royals' five doubles and  drove in three runs to help young Kevin Appier improve his record to 6-4.  </P> <P> Brett suffered a bruised collarbone in a collision at first base in Monday's  game. He was knocked flat by the Indians' Mitch Webster while catching a toss  from pitcher Jeff Montgomery. Webster was out, but Brett was hurt.  </P> <P> New York 10, Detroit 4 -- Mark Leiter, whose brother Al was a prize prospect  for the Yankees a few years ago, won his first major league start in this game  at New York. Leiter, 27, gave up eight hits in 7 1/3 innings in just his third  major league game.  </P> <P> Hot-hitting Roberto Kelly drove in two runs and scored two runs. Kelly also was  the hitting star Sunday when the Yankees swept a doubleheader. DAN HAFNER  </P></p>

If an oral evidentiary hearing is to be held, the appellant may appear at the hearing in person or by counsel. If either party fails to appear at the hearing, the presiding officer shall receive the evidence of the party appearing and render a decision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;953.8  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Location of hearing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Unless otherwise ordered by the presiding officer, the hearing shall be held at Postal Service headquarters, 475 L'Enfant Plaza, SW., Washington, DC, on the date set in the notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;953.9  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Change of place of hearing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Not later than the date fixed for the filing of the reply, a party may file a motion that the scheduled hearing be held at a place other than that designated in the notice.

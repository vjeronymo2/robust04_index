			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / International Company News: Exercise in reassurance at Nippon Credit - The bank hopes that its new president will restore its image MR HIROSHI Kubota, the new president of Nippon Credit Bank, has an impeccable reputation as a senior bureaucrat. The bank clearly hopes that his presence will lend credibility to claims that the worst of NCB's bad-loan problems are over. Mr Kubota makes it clear that he was not parachuted in by a finance ministry fearful that the bank was collapsing. He says he took the decision himself after an approach from NCB, one of Japan's three long-term credit banks. Through the reassuring Mr Kubota, the bank has begun a campaign to convince the outside world that reports of its problems are exaggerated, and to suggest that one reason for unwanted attention is that it has been forthcoming in dealing with non-performing loans. NCB estimates that its own problem loans are around Y592bn (Dollars 5.86bn), while links to ailing housing loan corporations and to three finance company affiliates have created another Y500bn in non-performing loans. At Y1,100bn, non-performing loans amount to around 10 per cent of the parent bank's total loans, but the narrow definition of problem loans in Japan has given rise to suspicions that the burden is far heavier. One sign of financial institutions' concerns is that the interest rate in the secondary market for five-year debentures issued by NCB has crept about 0.3 per cent above that of the Industrial Bank of Japan. The two banks issued the debentures at the same rate, but NCB's much-publicised problems have created, by Japanese standards, an unusual and embarrassing distinction between the two institutions. Bridging that interest rate gap would be a sign of the effectiveness of Mr Kubota, who aims to reduce NCB's problem loans to zero within the next three to four years - an ambitious goal given the deterioration of the Japanese property market, the source of many of the bank's ills. Clearing away the financial debris from the bubble era of the late 1980s - when NCB, along with many other Japanese banks, funded speculative property developments - is only part of Mr Kubota's brief. He also must restore the reputation of a bank that confesses to having a 'bad image'. After joining the finance ministry in 1954, Mr Kubota spent time as an inspector in the banking bureau and rose to become director-general of the National Tax Administration Agency. That background means that he knows a bank balance sheet, and his positive judgment of NCB's difficulties has had a calming influence, although it has not yet cleared away all concerns. Instead of emphasising the bad-loan figures, NCB points to a 68 per cent rise in core banking profits, to Y90.8bn, for the year ended March, due to a fall in official interest rates which created a favourable spread. Net profit fell 58 per cent to Y13.3bn after Y70bn in provisions and write-offs, which the bank said showed its determination to deal with its loan portfolio. Mr Kubota admits that the interest rate spreads may not be as favourable this year, but says the bank will generate profits through increased business in east Asia, which he recently toured: 'It is easier to generate new business in Asia than in a place like New York. Of course, New York is still very large and important, but Japanese companies are very interested in Asia now.' The new president also sees longer-term profits in domestic property, which he thinks will be stimulated by the need for urban redevelopment. The future emphasis, he says, will not just be on lending but in providing 'value-added services' in development, which would take advantage of the bank's traditional expertise. In the shorter term, the property market could continue to be a source of worry for the bank. Property loans account for 21.5 per cent of lending, and Tokyo Shoko Research, a private credit research company, estimates that NCB's total property-related exposure is 23.8 per cent, the second-highest of leading Japanese banks. The high level of exposure partly reflects the bank's past. From 1957 to 1977, NCB was known as the Nippon Fudosan Bank, or the Japan Property Bank. It was originally the Bank of Chosen, the central bank of Japanese-occupied Korea from 1909 to 1945, and was in charge of issuing bank notes in Manchuria, northern China. Japan's residential property market is showing signs of recovery, with demand for new apartments on the rise, but commercial property prices have fallen about 20 per cent in the past year, and appear set to fall further as large projects commissioned during the late 1980s are progressively completed. One sign of the continuing troubles in the property market is the inability of the Co-operative Credit Purchasing Company to sell property collateral. The CCPC was established by NCB and other Japanese banks in January to buy their non-performing property-related loans, and to put a floor under property prices by announcing details of collateral sales. In the period from January to July, the CCPC bought Y502.58bn in loan credits from banks, but recovered only Y920m in collateral.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] At the recent 19th conference of the Ho Chi Minh  City People's Committee, the City Anti-Corruption Steering  Committee reported on its work in 1993 and the first quarter of  1994.    The report said that various major corruption cases were  investigated and concluded, including those of the Saigon Auto  and LEGAMEX companies. The city communications and transport  office has also concluded seven cases with losses to state worth  90,141,000 dong and 100 cubic meter of timber. The city has  recovered state properties worth 1.35 billion dong.    Regarding the investigation of other cases, the city has  arrested several offenders involved in the illegal trade and use  of electricity as well as irregularities at the city  refrigerating company.    The City People's Court has tried many major cases of public  interest, including those of the Luc Quoc Hotel, the COXIVINA  Company, the Anh Hong Enterprise, and the Cai Be Tourism and  Cultural Service Corporation.    In the days ahead, the committee will integrate efforts to  investigate major corruption cases that cause serious losses to  state properties while urging the City People's Court to  urgently try various cases that have been sufficiently  investigated.</p>

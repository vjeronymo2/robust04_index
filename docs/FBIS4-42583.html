			<p>BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin has said that there  is no difference of opinion between Turkey and the UN Security  Council members about eliminating the losses incurred from the  oil sitting in the Karkuk-Yumurtalik pipeline for the past four  years. He stressed, however, that it appears that the operation  to rescue the pipeline cannot be carried out without regard for  the embargo on Iraq or by ignoring the United Nations.    Cetin was replying to questions at Ankara's Esenboga Airport  after seeing off the Thai foreign minister. Cetin pointed out  that the problem does not concern the United Nations alone and  that the Iraqi side should not be ignored. He added: This must  be done on common ground with Iraq. As far as we understand,  Iraq will not export the oil and no resources will be  transferred to Iraq. Consequently, we are continuing to explain  that this is a special operation. After our contacts with the  United Nations, we will contact Iraq once again if necessary and  try to reach a solution for the issue.    Replying to a question, Cetin said that no conclusion has  been reached during the talks in New York about whether Iraq's  share of the revenues from the oil in the pipeline will be  placed in the UN compensation account. He said: In light of  these negotiations, we will either say that an agreement has  been reached and act accordingly, or we will say that the  differences of opinion will be discussed again. In other words,  the process is under way. I believe that it will continue.  Turkey is right. I do not believe there is a way back from  here.</p>

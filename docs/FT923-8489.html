			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / Sharp fall in demand for credit as consumers repay more DEMAND for credit fell sharply in June as consumers paid back more than they borrowed on credit agreements excluding mortgages. The news, indicating that consumers are reluctant to spend, came as the latest consensus of forecasts from the City and economic think tanks shows output falling by 0.5 per cent this year. Forecasters have revised expectations for growth sharply downwards since the middle of the year when it became clear that a post-election surge in confidence had not turned into sustainable growth. This week a string of indicators is expected to show that the economy remains stuck in recession although inflation continues to fall. In June consumers repaid a net Pounds 55m on credit agreements with finance houses, building societies and bank credit cards that are part of the Visa or Mastercard system. This compares with net borrowing of Pounds 68m in May. According to the new series of figures from the Central Statistical Office, this was the first time since December that consumers paid back more than they borrowed. In the first five months of the year they borrowed but more slowly than in the equivalent period a year ago. The previous CSO credit business series distorted the net lending figure downwards by treating debts written off by banks as repayments. Consumers were wrongly believed to have been making the repayment of debts a priority in five of the first six months of the year. In fact, they added to their debts in every month except June. The seasonally adjusted figures, which do not include mortgages and account for about 15 per cent of total private-sector debt, showed that demand for credit shrank in the second quarter compared with the first quarter. Net lending grew by only Pounds 39m in the three months to June compared with Pounds 120m in the previous three months. The amount of new credit advanced in June was Pounds 4.2bn compared with Pounds 3.8bn in May. It grew by 1.7 per cent in the second quarter compared with the previous quarter. A broader measure of net lending to consumers, including bank overdrafts and loans from insurance companies and retailers, shows that consumers borrowed a net Pounds 54m in the second quarter compared with Pounds 93m in the first quarter.

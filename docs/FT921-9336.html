			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / Gatt urges 'rainforest payments' INDUSTRIAL countries should pay nations such as Brazil and Indonesia for the 'carbon absorption services' provided by their rainforests, a report published today argues. The report on trade and the environment from the Geneva-based General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade says that this would be more effective in curbing deforestation than attempts to ban trade in logs. The proposal illustrates a broader concern that trade measures - whether tariff walls, export bans or duties - are ineffective in tackling environmental problems. Mr Arthur Dunkel, Gatt director general, warned yesterday against the environment issue 'being kidnapped by trade protectionist interests'. The report is published four months ahead of the Rio 'earth summit', and is intended to provide a focus for what is expected to be a heated debate on trade and the environment. It says rainforest states are 'effectively exporting, free of charge, carbon absorption services to the rest of the world'. Gatt says an export ban on timber would not halt deforestation. These exports account for less than 1 per cent of trees felled in developing countries, whereas 80 per cent are felled as fuel for people unable to afford other fuels. It calls for international agreement on plans to halt deforestation which would include compensation to countries with large rainforests, employment promotion policies in these countries and improved access to industrial markets for their exports.

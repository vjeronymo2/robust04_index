			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Diplomats are desperately looking for a way out [on  Bosnia], desperately, in the literal sense of the word. The  American secretary of state, Warren Christopher, was in Paris  today. Stephane Manier reports:    [Manier] Warren Christopher was not expecting this. He was  not expecting the French to bring up for discussion the Bosnian  issue with so much insistence, including with President  Mitterrand this evening. It was also the case one hour earlier  with Prime Minister Edouard Balladur. The French repeated what  Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said this morning.    [Begin Juppe recording] However precious humanitarian aid  may  be, it is not sufficient to settle the problem, of course. A  political settlement is the only way out. [end recording]    It is obvious that the French did not want the Americans to  say only that they were ready to bomb Serbian artillery at any  time, but that they would become involved on the ground.  However, the Americans have not changed their position since  the NATO summit in Brussels.    [Begin Christopher recording in English with superimposed  French translation] The United States is not ready to have  ground troops in Bosnia to impose a solution in this conflict.  [end recording]    So the Americans have appeared really annoyed by the French  insistence, and Christopher's entourage speculated this evening:  aren't the French trying to make us take the blame for their  future withdrawal next spring? It is indeed difficult for the  Western side to speak with one voice. As for him, Warren  Christopher preferred to get into his limousine quickly.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mino Fuccillo: "Italians, Vote for Me"] </F>   [Excerpts] Rome -- Sunday [12 June] will see the first  referendum on the government, called by [Prime Minister] Silvio  Berlusconi. This is how he put it: "I expect many votes for  myself, for my party, and for the majority. The vote is for  Europe, but in the elections the Italian people will be telling  me: We like your government; carry on; we are with you. Or  not, in which case they will vote against the government." As  his mouth voiced this wager, the prime minister's eyes showed  that he was wagering on a virtual certainty, as he clung to  Forza Italia's good-luck charm -- the latest, inevitable,  promising opinion poll.    So next weekend will be the time for a referendum or,  rather,  a plebiscite, which is for what the prime minister is calling.  With regard to the recent past, he judged it unnecessarily full  of "bugbears" and "windmills." This is the substance of the  anxieties about the neofascist ministers, the suspicions and  hostility expressed abroad; so said Silvio Berlusconi, who  offered his personal loyalty to democratic principles as an  "absolute guarantee." As he repeated for the umpteenth time  that there is no Fascism and no problem, his smile grew  strained: These things irritate him, to the extent that he let  slip a half-insult to [French President] Mitterrand: "There are  abroad some old politicians who have been in power too long and  who are seeking electioneering arguments...."    At last a ready-made referendum, albeit an informal one: on  whether or not the Italians like a prime minister who is also  owner of Fininvest and many other things besides. Berlusconi  announced its result: "I have consulted the people. The  situation is already clear now; the guarantees are there; what  more do people want?" But perhaps Berlusconi will do something  more; perhaps he will sell: "I have thought about relinquishing  my companies to my five children." He let it be known that he  has not yet decided whether to go so far, but certainly any  future sale will not take place outside his family. It is  unnecessary, he repeated, but this, he made it understand, is  the last sacrifice that he is prepared to make: "My company no  longer belongs to me; I own shares and I do not rule out selling  them in the future." So tomorrow Fininvest could be owned not  by one Berlusconi but by five Berlusconis. [passage omitted]    Prime Minister, there are some anxieties.... "They have no  reason to exist. There is a complete democracy in Italy. And  if there are any dangers, they do not stem from the Right and  the center-Right. There is nothing to worry about; the fact is  that abroad, in France, in Greece, people are tilting at  windmills." Prime Minister, there are the fascists.... "I  testify to the complete adherence to democracy of the people in  my government. The Israeli under secretary merely expressed a  personal opinion. Clinton has understood that there was no  democratic alternative to this majority in Italy. People are  brandishing bugbears. But I have worked as a publisher, out in  the open. There are not many people of whom it can be said, as  it can of me, that they have made a profession of democracy.  And this is the absolute guarantee."    Prime Minister, the European elections.... "I am standing as  a candidate, even though I cannot be a member of the European  Parliament. It was important, essential, for me to lead the  movement. These elections will serve the government and have a  domestic significance. They must grant the government greater  authority than it has now." Prime Minister, are you referring  to the League? The prime minister elegantly evaded the question  and preferred to stress "Italy's need for a government that will  not change after a short space of time. A tragic legacy cannot  be changed in 100 days. Furthermore, please be patient; we are  not yet acquainted with the state machinery." There must be no  public disputes between the allies, and the government must be a  "long" one. Bossi and voters, please take note.    Prime Minister, your companies.... "I am light years away  from them. I have asked the people. Should I sell? And if so,  to whom? This somebody does not exist. The real guarantee is my  conscience. I am a man of government." The last question  concerned the celebrations and the emphasis that the Right  placed on the anniversary of 24 May 1918, but Berlusconi  misunderstood, thinking that it was a return to the dispute  about Fascism, and replied by asserting his loyalty to the  principles of the Republic and his aversion to dictatorship:  "Let us concentrate on the future, on the real problems, not on  dangers that do not exist."

Jose Cresencio Diaz, a 54-year old Salvadoran who worked as  a  security guard for U.S. Major Ismael Lopez, was killed on 21  January and Lopez was involved in the crime.    Melara Granillo said the U.S. diplomatic mission hid the  weapons reportedly used by Lopez, who, according to reports from  the prosecutor's office, was transferred to one of the U.S.  bases in Panama.    The U.S. Embassy argued Lopez had diplomatic immunity in  order to refuse delivering the evidence to Salvadoran  authorities, and therefore he was transferred from the country  without having to go through the legal Salvadoran immigration  procedures.    The attorney general noted: "The right thing to do would  have  been for the embassy to notify local authorities of this and to  have held him in custody according to the law."    Meanwhile, National Civilian Police Director Jose Maria  Monterrey said the diplomats want to misconstrue immunity with  impunity.    Salvadoran authorities did not rule out the possibility of  requesting the U.S. military officer's extradition through the  Salvadoran Foreign Ministry.</p>

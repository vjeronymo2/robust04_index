			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 31 Mar (MENA)--Arab League Secretary General  Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid met today with French Ambassador to  Cairo Patrick LeClercq, British Ambassador Christopher Long, and  U.S. Charge d'Affaires David Hill.    Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid briefed the three envoys on the Arab  League  Council resolution from its recent meeting to support the Libyan  stand in the Western-Libyan Lockerbie crisis and the Council's  adoption of a proposal to try the two suspected Libyan nationals  before the International Court of Justice in The Hague.    Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid said after the meeting that Libya took a  flexible stand when it agreed to the trial of its suspected  citizens before a neutral body. He said that the proposal  adopted by the Arab League Council at its recent meeting calls  for the travel of a Scottish court and judges to The Hague  because the U.S. plane crashed over the Scottish town of  Lockerbie and the law to apply in such a case is that of the  country where the incident happened.    The Arab League chief said that Scottish law is more  flexible  than English law, which only stipulates two outcomes of a trial:  either guilty or not guilty.    He added that he proposed at the meeting to have the  Security  Council issue a resolution transferring the Scottish court to  The Hague in order to begin the trial of the Libyans suspected  of involvement in the Lockerbie case.    He stressed that Libya is responsive and eager not to  escalate the Libyan-Western crisis since such an escalation will  have grave consequences for Libya, the neighboring countries,  the Mediterranean Sea countries, and even the European  countries, which will not be happy with the imposition of an  embargo on the export of Libyan oil.</p>

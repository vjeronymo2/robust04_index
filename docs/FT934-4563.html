			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / Local Government Commission in 'untenable position' The Local Government Commission, which is reviewing council structures in England, is in 'an untenable position', the European Policy Forum says in a report today. Mr Steve Leach, lecturer at Birmingham University's Institute of Local Government Studies and author of the report, predicted that local authorities would have 'strong grounds for challenging its recommendations in the courts because of inconsistency in its approach'. He said the impetus for reform had disappeared in a 'classic example of policy drift' (the survival of a policy initiative beyond the time when there is any real political commitment to it), and claimed that the exercise had already diverted large amounts of the organisational resources and energies of local government into an exercise of 'questionable value'. But Mr David Curry, the local government minister, denied that the review would place extra strains on councils already trying to accommodate radical changes in their budgets following yesterday's review of grants.

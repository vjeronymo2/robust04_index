			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / Slump in sales drives Porsche down market PORSCHE, the German sports car manufacturer whose vehicles have become symbolic of conspicuous consumption, is going down market to cope with the economic squeeze. A series of cheaper cars, selling below the current Porsche price range, is to be introduced in an attempt to break into a more modest customer market, the company announced last night. At the same time the Stuttgart-based manufacturer is to put 4,000 workers on short time, following a slump in 1991 sales to 26,200 - 4,000 fewer than in 1990, and little more than half the 50,000 vehicles sold in its golden year of 1986. Porsche said its alternative plan to introduce a 'two-plus-two' larger sports car to complement its two-seater range was being put on ice until the market picked up. 'This change in direction of model policy is a reaction to the changed consumer behaviour in the highest price and market sectors,' a sober company statement said. 'Sharper competition has forced Porsche to examine its work structure with the aim of making lasting economies.' On Wednesday, Mr Arno Bohn, chief executive of Porsche, revealed a drop in net profits to DM17.1m (Pounds 5.9m) to the end of July, from DM57m in the previous year. He forecast production this year would fall to 25,000 cars, with no improvement in profits. The real collapse in the Porsche market has been in the US, where five years ago 68 per cent of its output was sold. That is now running at just 4,400 cars a year, or 23 per cent of production, with the situation aggravated by the dollar's weakness against the D-Mark. Porsche gave no clue last night how its new model would look. But the official statement said that it would be 'on a technically different basis' to the present models. As for the substantial research and development work done on the originally intended 'two-plus-two', the whole series will benefit from the innovations, Porsche said. The suffering of the luxury sports car company coincides with figures revealing 1991 as the all-time boom year for the German motor industry, thanks to demand from what was East Germany. Sales of new cars hit 4.16m for the whole of united Germany, registering a 12.8 per cent increase in the west alone to 3.43m, a record for the second successive year. Lotus, General Motors' troubled UK sports car subsidiary, is to shed a further 70 jobs, bringing the total lost since the middle of last year to 370, or more than 40 per cent of the workforce. Lotus said Lotus Engineering and Millbrook Proving ground, its research and development and consultancy engineering subsidiaries, were unaffected. Nissan Micra unveiled: Picture, Page 7</p>

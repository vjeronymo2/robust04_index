			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: Portillo tries to tug at the reins of a few favourites - Philip Stephens looks at the gloomy prospects that will surround the coming season of public-spending negotiations WHEN Mr Michael Portillo explains to cabinet colleagues how serious he is about restraining public spending, he begins with a disarming reflection on his own recent career. He begins by conceding that for each of them, the loss of a cherished project or cuts in a priority programme in this year's negotiations will cause painful political embarrassment. Then the chief secretary to the Treasury reminds his colleagues that he knows more than most about such embarrassment. As local-government minister under Mrs Margaret Thatcher he had been a public and committed champion of the poll tax, he recalls. Re-appointed by Mr John Major, he was charged - against his better judgment and at considerable personal cost - with its abolition. The message is clear. Mr Portillo will not be impressed by pleading that the scrapping of a planned roads scheme or the shelving of a new training programme would cause his colleagues undue discomfort in the House of Commons. So far, no blood has actually been spilt in the negotiating skirmishes, although there has been the usual trickle of leaks about the Treasury's prime targets - the defence, unemployment benefit, housing, roads and Home Office budgets among them. Looking over his shoulder at an economy still mired in recession and a borrowing requirement heading for Pounds 35bn, Mr Major will deliver a stern lecture on the need for prudence when he chairs a decidedly downbeat cabinet discussion on the economic outlook later this month. The real battles will then be fought in September and October. No one is in any doubt that they will be tough. In spite of a pre-election spree, Whitehall officials acknowledge that on present trends the Treasury will miss its Pounds 226.6bn spending target for the current 1992-93 financial year. Some Pounds 450m has already been taken from the Pounds 4bn contingency reserve to pay for the teachers' pay award, for increased income support for pensioners and for health-service wage settlements. That figure does not include the huge cost of higher unemployment. The number out of work is already more than 300,000 above the 2.4m allowed for in the present spending plans. It is still rising and, on a conservative estimate, the higher jobless total will cost an extra Pounds 2bn this year and Pounds 3bn next. It will further cloud a bleak medium-term outlook. In the five years from 1985-86 to 1989-90 the Treasury's planning total  - the departmental allocations that provide the main instrument of expenditure control - remained flat in real terms. For the subsequent five years - from 1990-91 to 1994-95 - the Treasury's plans already assume an increase after inflation of 20 per cent. That figure assumes heroically that Mr Portillo will not add a penny to the targets, but if the Treasury cannot win in the first spending round after a general election, it never will. A large part of the prospective increase - perhaps half - can be attributed to the recession. The rest reflects a conscious loosening of the reins in the approach to the general election. It will not be easy to re-tighten them. Mr Portillo's starting point is a planning total for 1993-94 of Pounds 244.5bn and for 1994-95 of Pounds 258bn. He must also pencil in a figure for 1995-96. In theory the totals, which include sizeable reserves, allow for ample growth in Whitehall spending - an average in real terms of 3.5 per cent in each of the next two years. That follows a planned increase of 5.75 per cent in the current year. In practice, most of the additional money will be absorbed by the higher benefit payments to the unemployed and by the additions to local-authority budgets needed to smooth the introduction next April of the council tax. Transitional relief schemes to ease the impact of the council tax in the recession-hit south-east might well cost Pounds 1.25bn next year. Local authorities will need another Pounds 1bn to allow even a small real increase in spending. So Mr Portillo cannot afford to allow other Whitehall departments any increase in the 'baseline' figures agreed last year. Some of those budgets - including for employment, housing, defence, transport, agriculture, and trade and industry - already point to real cuts in spending. But to meet the overall target, further reductions will be needed to pay for unavoidable increases elsewhere. The Treasury has already earmarked a number of 'soft' targets. It wants drastic cuts in the Department of Transport's roads programme to pay for increased financial support for British Rail and London Regional Transport. It is casting a close eye over the Department of Education's capital spending and at the Home Office's ambitious prison-building programme. The Department of the Environment's housing budget - a beneficiary in recent years of Mr Major's caring Conservatism - is another prime candidate. Smaller reductions are expected from the DoE's green budget and that for employment training. Defence remains a cherished target because it has successfully resisted the large savings that might have flowed from the collapse of communism. But even if - as the Treasury expects - the European Fighter Aircraft is never built, the peace dividend will take some years to materialise. The Department of Social Security is under pressure to deliver reductions in other benefits - including unemployment benefit - to help finance income support and housing benefit payments for the jobless. The health budget already includes a 2.75 per cent real increase in spending. The Treasury would like some back to finance the care in the community programme. Senior ministers believe substantial cuts across Whitehall are possible. But the chief secretary is as strong or weak as his prime minister; and to the chagrin of his predecessor, the author of the Citizen's Charter has so far proved himself more willing to spend than save.</p>

			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / International Company News: Sharp rise seen for Delhaize DELHAIZE 'Le Lion', the Belgian retail group, expects to announce a 'sharp increase' in consolidated net profit for 1992, boosted by exceptional profits from the sale of treasury stock and operations in Portugal. Delhaize said yesterday consolidated sales had risen by 5 per cent in 1992 to BFr326bn (Dollars 10bn) from BFr310bn, in spite of a 7 per cent decline in the value of the dollar. Food Lion itself lifted sales 11.8 per cent to Dollars 7.2bn, and Delhaize said the US stores' sales in the last five weeks of 1992 rose by 28 per cent. Belgian operations had sales of BFr91.2bn, up 6.4 per cent. For 1991, Delhaize announced net consolidated profits of BFr4.37bn, and a dividend of BFr87 a share.</p>

			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / Arts: Osud - Semper Opera, Dresden One's heart goes out to Dresden. With blackened stone ruins still peering out of the rubble in parts of the city centre and socialist architecture dominating the rest, the people now face another form of reconstruction - their economy, their livelihood, their self-esteem. With industry at a standstill, tens of thousands out of work and a growing disillusionment with the promises made at reunification, what priority does music have in people's lives? The city's two main music institutions - the Semper Opera and the Dresden Philharmonic Orchestra  - will survive, but much of the cultural substructure will not. The first night of Osud was less than three-quarters full. That says less about the Dresdeners' lack of curiosity (or about ticket prices, which are still extremely low), than that they have other preoccupations in these hard times. Osud marks the end of an era: it is Joachim Herz's last production in Dresden. He has worked there in comparative obscurity for the past ten years, but his production style and cantankerous personality have made him superfluous to the incoming artistic team led by Christoph Albrecht. Herz's decision to take the Saxon state government to court over the ending of his contract makes a sad spectacle. Osud illustrated two classic traits in postwar German opera production - a natural animation of the stage, releasing the inner impetus of the music, which is Herz's inheritance from Walter Felsenstein; and a congenital tendency to over-interpret. Act one was beautiful. Reinhart Zimmermann's permanent set consisted of a gently stepped wooden platform, which together with Eleonore Kleiber's costumes preserved the period charm of Janacek's setting. Behind lay a wall of large slanted mirrors, reflecting the stations in Zivny's relationship with Mila - the first rapture of eyes meeting, the exchange of roses after one of Zivny's concerts. But the chief distinction lay in Herz's choreography of the spa scenes - the sedate bourgeoisie, the carefree couples, the brood of schoolgirls - so that everyone on stage was an individual, without a trace of the artificial movement that has become synonymous with Herz's successors at the Komische Oper. The domestic setting of Act two was suggested by little more than a settee, a kitchen dresser and a precipitous flight of stairs. Here Herz depicted the interlocking pressures on Zivny - mother-in-law, creative crisis, marriage strains, alcohol problem - through a series of equally convincing vignettes. Having respected Janacek's awkward but viable dramatic outline thus far, Herz then made a complete mess of the final act. Zivny's tortured solos were transposed to the beginning, as he wrestled with skeletons of the past (bombed-out buildings, machine-gunfire and the usual German militaristic cliches) in an attempt to reactivate his creative inspiration. After a shortened conservatoire scene, with Mila reincarnated as the impressionable student Souckova, Zivny ended up in a mental clinic. For anyone who saw the ENO and Dusseldorf stagings in the mid-1980s, both of which were faithful to Janacek's original, Herz's solution was nothing more than a piece of interpretative hack-work. No such reservations about the musical performance, which was consistently inspired. The rhythmic buoyancy and clean, light-fingered articulation of the orchestral playing under Hans Zimmer showed that the Staatskapelle can be as idiomatic in Janacek as they are in Richard Strauss. Zivny was sung by Michael Rabsilber, whose pointed Germanic high tenor and sensitive acting made him a near-ideal interpreter. In spite of being handicapped by dark glasses and a spooky white cape, Kerstin Witt as Mila's mother acted the disintegrating old harridan to the hilt. But the chief glory of the performance lay in Vlatka Orsanic's Mila, a vibrant, radiant soprano who phrased her soaring lines with moving eloquence.</p>

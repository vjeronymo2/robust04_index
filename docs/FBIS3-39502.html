Surveying 1,700  companies, the Chambers of Industry and Commerce in Bochum,  Dortmund, Duisburg, Essen, and Muenster discovered that every  second firm is thinking of reducing its staff this year.    In industry, two out of three companies want to cut jobs. In  1993, more than 37,000 people in the Rhein and Ruhr areas lost  their jobs; 13,000 of them had been employed in the mining  industry. Since a large number of jobs have been destroyed by  the escalating costs and structural changes, there will be no  success stories from the labor market in the foreseeable future,  the president of the Duisburg Chamber of Industry and Commerce,  Hans Georg Willers, said.    In the Ruhr area, 155,000 jobs have been created in the  service sector over the past 15 years -- yet the same number was  lost in manufacturing industry.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature by diplomatic </F> correspondents Igor Porshnev, Vitaliy Trubetskoy and others]    [Text] The development of cooperation with Argentina is a  "very important element of Russia's relations with Latin America  as a whole, said the head of Russian diplomacy, Andrey Kozyrev,  after a meeting with the Argentinian Minister of Foreign Affairs  and International Trade, Guido Di Tella.    As he said, relations between the two countries "entered the  phase of close cooperation." "Considering Argentina's weight  and influence in Latin America, cooperation with it is very  important to us," Kozyrev said.    Upon conclusion of their talks the two men signed a protocol  on consultations between their ministries and an  intergovernmental agreement on visa-free travel for the holders  of diplomatic and service passports; they also initialled a  basic political document on the fundamentals of relations  between the Russian Federation and Argentina. "The documents we  signed are the basis and at the same time only the tip of the  iceberg of our close cooperation," Kozyrev said.    According to him, relations between Moscow and Buenos Aires  develop not only on bilateral foundations, but also on the  "global level." "Argentina is a key state in Latin America, and  at the moment we are engaged in active work on that continent,  establishing cooperation with the Organization of American  States and with regional economic structures," Kozyrev said.    As he said, Russia is interested in promoting interaction  with Buenos Aires also in the framework of the U.N., since at  present Argentina is a non-permanent member of the U.N. Security  Council.    For his part Guido Di Tella pointed out that Argentina views  Russia as a great world power. We closely follow what happens  in Russia, and we believe that your reforms deserve great  respect, he said.    According to him, the two countries' stands on many  international issues approximate or coincide. When discussing  the problems of world security and the future world structure,  we speak in one language of cooperation and mutual respect, he  concluded.    As the political adviser to the head of Russian diplomacy,  Galina Sidorova, told journalists, during the talks with his  Argentinian counterpart Kozyrev drew his attention to the  incident involving the Russian fishing ship Orel detained by the  Argentinian authorities since February, 1993.    "Our ship was detained on the pretext that it was engaged in  fishing in the Argentinian economic zone. We view this pretext  as far-fetched, and hope that an acceptable solution to this  issue will be found after all," Sidorova said.</p>

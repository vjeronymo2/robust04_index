			<p><P> October 17, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SOVIET HARVEST BOUNTIFUL -- BUT SO ARE LOSSES  </P> <P> The Soviet Union, facing widespread public unrest due to serious food  shortages, had a record grain crop this year but tremendous losses occurred  during harvesting, government estimates released today showed.  </P> <P> An official at the State Statistics Committee put the harvest at 240 million  metric tons, about 3 million more than the previous record in 1978.  </P> <P> The harvest was achieved despite bad weather and shortages of labor and  transportation. Officials called out students, factory workers and even KGB  forces to help bring in the grain.  </P> <P> But losses still occurred. A senior Soviet agriculture official, speaking on  television last month, said there was about 300 million metric tons of grain in  the fields at the start of the harvest.  </P> <P> The Soviet Union, the world's biggest grain importer, has been counting on a  big crop to reduce its purchases on the world market. Initially officials hoped  for 260 million metric tons.  </P> <P> Last month, as bread shortages hit Moscow, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev  accused farmers of holding back grain and ordered urgent action to make them  hand it over.  </P> <P> This year, purchases as well as harvesting were crippled by the general  disintegration of the old controlled economic system, with many farmers hoping  to sell grain on fledgling private markets or keeping more for themselves  against future food shortages.  </P></p>

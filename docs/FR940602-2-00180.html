			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 41.23d_In-Lieu Lots. Pursuant to FSM 2347.1, paragraph 6, in-lieu lots may be offered to holders who have received notice that their permits are being revoked for reasons other than noncompliance or that a new permit will not be issued following expiration of their existing permits because the lot is needed for an alternative public use. Identify and offer in-lieu lots in accordance with FSM 2347.1, paragraph 6 and FSM 2721.23f and follow these procedures: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. When available, offer in-lieu lots to holders at the time that notice is given that the lot will be converted to an alternative public use and a new permit will not be issued. If lots do not become available until later, offer them then. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Give first priority to identifying and offering in-lieu lots in the same tract or an expansion of that tract, where feasible. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Arrange a joint inspection of the in-lieu lot with the holder. Allow the holders 90 days from the date of the joint inspection of the in-lieu lot or 90 days from the final disposition of any appeals of the decision to convert the lot to an alternative public use, whichever is later, to accept or reject the offer. The 90-day period shall occur while access to the lot is possible. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. When holders accept such offers, issue a new permit and reserve the offered lots. Do not charge a fee until the holder begins construction of improvements on the lot. A partial waiver of fees for the in-lieu lot may be appropriate until the improvements are actually occupied. The lot reservation will expire upon holder's failure to begin construction on the in-lieu lot on a mutually-agreed upon schedule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Allow holders accepting offers to continue use of their current lots until the expiration date. Inform the holders that they should be prepared to move to the in-lieu lot during the 24 months prior to permit expiration, provided the supplemental review of the decision to convert the present lot to an alternative public use has been completed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. The opportunity to develop an in-lieu lot, if accepted by the previous owner, shall be extended to the new owner, if eligible, when there is a change in ownership of authorized improvements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. Do not offer in-lieu lots for revocation actions stemming from noncompliance with special use permit terms. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Forest Service Handbook 2709.11_Special Uses  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Chapter 50_Terms and Conditions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 54_Special Use Authorizations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 54.1_Term Special Use Permit for Recreation Residences.

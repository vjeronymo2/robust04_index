			<p>BFN     [Text] Deputy Prime Minister Roman Kovac regards the  deputies' proposal to express no confidence in himself as a kind  of lesson. In an interview granted to the TASR news agency, he  said that he learned from circles close to the Movement for a  Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] that proposals similar to this one  are being prepared to be raised at the next meeting of  parliament.    Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik said the debate on no  confidence in Roman Kovac documented the poverty of the  political culture of certain sections of deputies and political  groups. At the same time, he did not rule out that similar  proposals on no confidence will appear in the future, too. He  said, however, that he is convinced that these moves do not at  all affect the stability of the present government.</p>

			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Court rules on poll tax computer loophole THE HIGH COURT yesterday refused to close the loophole holding up poll tax prosecutions, ruling that liability orders based on computer print-outs were illegal. Declaring computer evidence 'hearsay', the court upheld an earlier ruling by magistrates in Coventry. The ruling could affect thousands of pending debt-collection cases. The bill introducing the council tax, currently before the Lords, will make such evidence admissible for the future, but councils are unlikely to proceed with liability orders affected by the ruling until the bill becomes law early next month. Mr Michael Portillo, local government minister, said the bill had been amended 'precisely to make clear that in future computer evidence will not be regarded as hearsay'. The Conservative-led Association of District Councils said the ruling was a 'disastrous setback to collection', which could jeopardise all liability orders issued in the past three months.</p>

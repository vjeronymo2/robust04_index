			<p><P> October 31, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH;  </P> <P> VOTERS WILL DECIDE ON LEASE EXTENSION  </P> <P> Voters next week will decide whether Newport Beach should extend the lease on  property at Pacific Coast Highway and Newport Boulevard to encourage private  redevelopment of the site.  </P> <P> Measure R on the Nov. 7 ballot would authorize the city to extend the lease of  the property, which now expires in 2008, for 10 years. An extension would  provide incentive for a real estate firm to improve the property, according to  Barry Permenter, who manages real estate for the county.  </P> <P> "People can expect a full redevelopment of a property that's been an eyesore  for a number of years, and it won't cost them anything in terms of tax  dollars," Permenter said.  </P> <P> The land and a five-story building on it are owned by Newport Beach and the  county. Haseko-LSW, a Los Angeles-based firm, now leases the building.  </P> <P> Within a few years, the renovation could increase the minimum rent charged from  $200,000 to about $350,000, he said. Plus, when the lease expires, all  improvements to the land revert to the city and county, he added.  </P> <P> Even if Measure R passes, the lease extension is not automatic, Permenter said.  The county will renegotiate the lease with input from Newport Beach. JON NALICK  </P></p>

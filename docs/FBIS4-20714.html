			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article signed S.A.M.: "Bizerte Development; Agriculture: </F> Deficits and Records"--first two paragraphs are LA PRESSE DE  TUNISIE introduction]    [Text] Since early last fall, all weather data pointed to a  difficult year for agriculture, so much so that waiting for rain  became the major concern of all Tunisians. Even children were  talking about it, asking questions, and welcoming the first  drops of the showers that belatedly restored the hopes of many  people.    Today, right at mid-season, now that the die is cast and the  major crop campaign is well under way, how are things,  especially in the Bizerte area, one of the country's granaries?  Based on current data, was there enough rain, shall we have a  good grain harvest and enough fodder?  <H5>  Rain Deficit </H5>   According to agriculture experts, the rainfall recorded in  the Bizerte area from the beginning of the season until the end  of last January reached the 244.4-mm mark; this represents a  36.6-percent deficit of 167.6 mm, because 418.45 mm of rain fell  over the area during the season 1992-93.    On the other hand, the number of rainy days decreased rather  appreciably: 39 days compared with an average of 62 days for the  period in question.    In addition, on 21-23 January, the Bizerte area was far more  affected than the rest of the country by violent winds exceeding  95 km per hour, an unusual rise in the maximum temperature  (estimated at 5.3 degrees), and an estimated 98.4-percent  increase of the water evaporation rate.  <H5>  Input and Seed: A Small But Real Gap </H5>   The chemical fertilizer needs of the Bizerte area are  estimated at 220,000 quintals of Ammonitre [ammonium nitrate  fertilizer on plaster], 111,000 quintals of 45-percent  phosphate, and 75,000 quintals of DAP [diammonium phosphate].    However, until 31 January, the quantities available were  much  below the above requirements, amounting to only 110,000 quintals  of Ammonitre, 63,000 quintals of phosphate, and 59,000 quintals  of DAP for the area--not including, of course, the stocks of the  Tunisian Chemical Fertilizer Company, estimated at 9,200  quintals of Ammonitre and phosphate.    As for the quantities of high-grade seed offered by  distribution centers, as of 31 January 1994 they amounted to  18,947 quintals, whereas the program prepared by the general  directorate of vegetable production mentioned a total of 26,000  quintals; the realization rate, therefore, is 72.9 percent.    Note in addition that 17,521 quintals of choice seed had  been  distributed by 25 January 1994.    All these data (bad weather and irregular supplies of  agricultural input and choice seed) slightly affected the  season's good progress for major crops, truck crops, and tree  growers, eventually leaving unaffected only the potato  crop--which actually benefitted from the balmy weather of  December and January--and the bulk of truck crops.  <H5>  Major Crops: Wait and Hope </H5>   During the 1993-94 season, an estimated 156,000 hectares  [ha]  were cultivated, compared with a projected 185,000 ha, hence an  overall 84.6-percent realization rate.    A little over one-half of this area (i.e., 88,265 ha) was  devoted to grain (soft and hard wheat, barley, and triticale),  i.e., 1,195 ha less than during the previous season; this,  experts agree, is insignificant compared to the effect of late  and inadequate rainfall.    Concerning fodder, we can also say that the deficit is very  small because about 48,500 ha in the area were planted in fodder  crops this year (compared with projections of 55,500 ha and last  season's figure of 50,470 ha), and since the State was able to  make up for it by guaranteeing adequate barley and bran supplies  to livestock breeders.    On the other hand, legumes and industrial crops seem to have  been most severely affected and set back by the inadequate  rainfall: only 17,235 ha could be planted with legumes (compared  with 29,890 ha in 1992-93), and 476 ha with industrial crops  (compared with 2,705 ha last year).    Similarly, tree growing programs were also affected by the  weather, resulting in a relatively late start of the season; as  of 31 January 1994, 120 ha had been planted in the area's common  tree varieties (almond, apple, pear, plum, peach, pomegranate,  and olive trees), whereas the 1993-94 program provided for 700  ha being planted with fruit trees.  <H5>  Potatoes: Record Results </H5>   The potato crop, for its part, largely exceeded all previous  averages, with 1,020 ha planted in late season, and early  potatoes.    This appreciable increase is due mostly to the latter  variety, which takes up 420 ha this year, compared with a  previous average of 280 ha. This is because of the higher  temperatures that prevailed last December and January and  because of profitable sales of main season's potatoes and the  arrival of fall potatoes on the market.    As far as the former variety is concerned, we should note  that the acreage under cultivation amounts to 600 ha. Projected  production amounts to 8,100 tons, or 15 tons per hectare with  irrigation and 8 tons without; 85 percent of the crop was  harvested and harvesting operations still go on.    For the other early greenhouse vegetables, programs continue  at a steady rate and 15.5 ha were already planted with peppers,  tomatoes, strawberries, and cucumbers.    We should also note that 2,800 ha were planted with various  vegetables (including 690 ha just for artichokes) despite the  relative lack of rainfall.    However, agricultural departments estimate that this leaves  a  deficit of 32 percent for garlic, 46 percent for broad beans,  and 33 percent for green onions.    This being said, if all these figures seem somewhat  pessimistic, we should still not jump to conclusions; just  consider the considerable rainfall of the first two weeks of  February and the rain that cannot fail to fall over the area and  over the country (we fervently wish it will) next March, which  will be worth its weight in gold for all agricultural varieties.    At this stage in the season, the only possible conclusion is  that, although it may not break records, the year will not be as  bad as we might be inclined to believe. Isn't greenery already  covering our land?</p>

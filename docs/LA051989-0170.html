			<p><P> May 19, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NEW YORK POST TO SCALE BACK ITS SUNDAY GAMBLE  </P> <P> The New York Post's Sunday editions, which first appeared on newsstands just 11  weeks ago, will be cut in size and price next month because of a lack of  advertising revenue, executives of the newspaper announced.  </P> <P> The Post will reduce the Sunday edition's price from $1 to 40 cents, the price  of the daily paper, and will abandon several supplemental sections beginning  June 4, the newspaper's president, Valerie Salembier, said.  </P> <P> "The advertising support wasn't there for a million different reasons,"  Salembier said.  </P> <P> No employees will be laid off despite the cuts, she said.  </P> <P> The Sunday edition made its debut March 5. At the time, media analysts called  the venture a high-risk gamble that could determine the future of the  188-year-old tabloid in the highly competitive metropolitan news market.  </P> <P> The Post spent $25 million to launch the Sunday edition and undertook an  aggressive campaign to attract more affluent readers and advertisers.  </P> <P> The Sunday edition's circulation hovered, however, at just over 300,000 after  peaking at about 450,000 when it first hit newsstands, Salembier said.  </P> <P> The revamped Sunday Post will cost the same and look similar to the paper's  daily editions, she said, adding that the 40-cent price is expected to boost  circulation "a couple hundred thousand, for sure."  </P> <P> The lack of advertising support for the pull-out sections -- especially the  absence of supermarket coupon supplements -- caused executives to reconsider  their strategy for the Sunday edition, Salembier said.  </P></p>

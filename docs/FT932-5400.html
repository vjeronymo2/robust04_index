			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / Setback for Major as poll rating slumps A SLUMP in Mr John Major's popularity to the lowest recorded by any prime minister since the second world war delivered another blow last night to his embattled government. A Gallup opinion poll, which showed support for the government sliding to 25 per cent and for Mr Major personally to just 21 per cent, underlined the threat of a Conservative defeat in the forthcoming Christchurch by-election. It compares with the lowest satisfaction rating of 23 per cent recorded by the then Mrs Margaret Thatcher in spring 1990. Six months later she was toppled as party leader. The findings by Gallup, which began polling in 1938, coincided with a fresh outbreak of recriminations in the Conservative party over Mr Major's decision to sack Mr Norman Lamont as chancellor in last week's cabinet reshuffle. With friends of the former chancellor suggesting he is still 'stunned' by his dismissal, some Tory Euro-sceptics are urging him to pin on Mr Major the blame for sterling's ignominious exit from the exchange rate mechanism. The Gallup survey, published in today's issue of The Daily Telegraph, shows that only 21 per cent of the electorate is satisfied with Mr Major's performance. The poll indicates that the Conservatives can now claim the support of only 25 per cent of voters, down from 30 last month. The government's support is fractionally above the 23 per cent backing for the Liberal Democrats (up from 17.5 per cent last month). Labour's support rose to 49 per cent, up from the previous figure of 47 per cent - giving the opposition a 24-point lead, the second-highest yet recorded by Gallup. Most of the fieldwork for the poll was conducted after the reshuffle. Mr Major is expected to use his speech today to the annual conference of Conservative women to appeal for party unity after the turmoil since the defeats last month in the Newbury by-election and the county council elections. There were suggestions that he would include a suitable tribute to Mr Lamont in the hope of damping the former chancellor's appetite for revenge. But the growing disarray in the Conservative party was underlined by a renewed attack on Mr Major's style of government by Mr Edward Leigh, a right-wing Tory sacked as a junior minister last week. The depths of the government's unpopularity has also been brought home personally to ministers and Tory MPs by visits during this week's Whitsun recess to their constituencies. Mr Major also faces the prospect next week of a new onslaught on the Maastricht treaty by Lady Thatcher and Lord Tebbit. The bill moves to the House of Lords on Monday and Lady Thatcher may use the debate for a more general attack on her successor's policies. Conservative support in Scotland remains at 16 per cent, according to a System Three poll for The Herald newspaper in Glasgow. The figure is their lowest rating since March 1986.

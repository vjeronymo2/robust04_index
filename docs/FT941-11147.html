			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / Markets: The global interest rate winds blow - London Ken Clarke, exhibiting powers of command and control beyond the dreams of John Major, pushed a button in London on Tuesday. Seconds later, on an oil platform 211 miles offshore of Aberdeen, curtains rolled back on a plaque inaugurating BP's Bruce Field. If only the chancellor could so deftly deal with the offshore pressures afflicting London markets. In the US, Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, told congress that US interest rates would have to rise. In Germany, the Bundesbank, disturbed by a surge in money supply, postponed hopes of a German interest rate cut. Throughout the week, London equity and gilts marketsswung in these global interest rate winds. Monday and Wednesday UK rate cuts were on the agenda and stocks rose sharply. Tuesday, Thursday and yesterday cuts were off and stocks dropped. Few other, if any, factors seemed to animate investors and dealers. The FT-SE 100 closed a net 28 points up on the week at 3475.4, reaching a milestone along the way. Monday's close was the first time the Footsie, on an inflation- adjusted basis, bettered its record set on the eve of the 1987 market crash. As the chart shows, equities have handsomely outperformedgilts, inflation-adjusted, over the same period. Inflation is dormant atleast, if not actually dead as politicians and some economists would have us believe. Yet, a small cloud of inflationary chaff blew through the markets late inthe week. Deploying its 'pushing-on-a-wet-noodle' style of command and control, the cabinet waved through a wage settlement for 1.5m public sector employees. The increase, some 50 per cent higher than the current rate of inflation, will cost the government Pounds 1bn. A smack of firmer guidance came, however, fromEddie George, governor of the Bank of England. Prospects for sustained growth and gradual reduction in unemployment were 'better than at any time' in his career, he told banquetting bankers. Do not expect a rate cut, was the subtext his audience, not to mention a wider market public, inferred. But with due respect to UK authorities, it is the thoughts and imminent actions of the Fed which are preying on the markets. Normally the Fed does not tip its hand to the market for some time after its once-every-six-weeks policy setting meetings. Yesterday, 24 hours after its latest meeting, it did break the pattern with a highly unusual statement. It said it had decided to tighten monetary policy via a 'smallincrease in short-term money market interest rates.' London and Wall Street stocks retreated instantly but moderately on the news. What, though, will be the considered response? The overwhelming fear has been that US investors, particularly retail rather than institutional, would rapidly shift their perceptions and portfolios when the upturn in interest rates came. The torrent of money flowing out of cash into equities, particularly foreign ones, would be reversed. 'It is commonly argued that the current global bull market will be brought to an end when US interest rates begin to rise because US retail investors will start to sell equities. We regard this scenario as relatively unlikely,' argue Sushil Wadhwani and Mushtaq Shah, two London-based strategists of Goldman, Sachs. Looking at the previous three troughs in US interest rates, they found that individual investors continued to increase their ownership of equities for some time after interest rates began to rise. Typically, six months after the turn, investors have still only made some 10 per cent of the portfolio shift they eventually make. In other words, it takes them a while to switch their investment mantras from 'cash is trash' to 'cash is king'. In such an upturn, equities will continue to outperform bonds thanks, in part, to strong growth in corporate earnings which is kicking in at this stage in the economic cycle. Moreover, European equity markets would gain protection from their domestic flow of funds and from the more cautious reactions of European investors. The desire to pile into equities appeared to be borne out by the remarkable UK investor response this week to two European privatisation investment trusts launched by Mercury Asset Management and Kleinwort Benson. Together, the funds are seekingsome Pounds 1.075bn. So far they have attracted Pounds 645m from institutions plus Pounds 880mand rising from individuals. Cautious, slow responses were hardly the hallmarks of the main corporate story of the week: BAe's decision to sell its 80 per cent holding in the Rover car group to BMW for Pounds 800m of cash and Pounds 900m of debt relief. With speed and agility worthy of the cars they build, BMW executives slapped an offer on the table. BAe, with equally impressive speed, headed for the motor industry exit ramp. Honda, Rover's partner, saviour and 20 percent shareholder, was left gasping in BAe's dusty slipstream. The story appears to be far from over yet. Honda, with an impressively stout leash on Rover through product and technology licensing agreements, could extract a high price from BMW for its continuing co-operaton. BAe, liberated from mundane terrestrial transport, has great new freedom to develop its aerospace and defence interests. The City, thrilled by BAe's prospects, sharply re-rated its stock. The shares closed up 131p on the week at 575p. Others were sucked along in its slipstream. Car part makers such as GKN, BAA and T &amp; N, for example, could gain newbusiness from BMW's new British connection. But the emotional fallout was heavy. With one push of the deal button, ownership of the last British volumecar maker slipped offshore.</p>

			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / Finance and the Family: Risk and reward in recovery funds - They buy recession-hit shares cheaply, then wait for the upswing RECOVERY funds are beginning to live up to their name. These are inherently riskier than most, the idea being to invest in companies which have got into difficulties, causing a slump in their share price. The theory is that a point is reached where these difficulties are over-estimated; at that stage, the cheapness of the shares allows for large gains once the company 'recovers.' The theory does badly in recessions, something shown clearly by the table of recovery funds in the unit trust sector. 'We've had three miserable years,' says Richard Hughes, fund manager of M &amp; G's Recovery unit trust, the largest recovery fund in the UK growth sector. 'Companies which are struggling do not find it easy to solve their problems when sales are falling.' As the figures show, however, recovery funds displayed a marked improvement in performance in the year to February. Fidelity's fund, ranked 131 in the UK growth sector in the three years to February, is now top. Recovery funds are not a sector in themselves, and definitions of what distinguishes them from a general UK growth or a special situations fund are debatable. Graham Clapp, manager of Fidelity's fund, says: 'When a company has problems and the share price falls significantly, I buy the shares if I think something will happen to reverse that - usually a change in management - or if I anticipate a change in the industry.' He bought into Burton Group, the largest holding in his fund, early last year after a change in management. The ailing Midland bank also was seen as recovery stock in mid-1991 when Clapp invested in it. As he explains: 'We anticipated a change in the banking industry in terms of the profitability of the UK banking business, and there had been a change in management.' Fidelity's fund holds a maximum of 10 to 15 per cent in Footsie stock, but the strongest concentration is in smaller companies. Similarly, M &amp; G's Hughes chooses companies with a weak balance sheet, bad management or a troublesome subsidiary. 'I wouldn't go off and buy Glaxo just because the share price is low,' he says. A maximum of about 30 per cent is invested in FT-SE 100 stock. Like recovery stocks, special situations' stock often is undervalued, but the reason for this is different. Clapp cites the example of Racal. 'When it was starting off Vodaphone, you could not class it as being in a recovery-type situation.' While the recession has provided few chances for investors to make money, it has given fund managers opportunities to buy. Patrick Evershed, hired from Framlington by Brown Shipley to revive its recovery trust, which was languishing at the bottom of the league tables, has taken a more 'purist' view of recovery stock. He has been buying into highly depressed sectors in the past 18 months including estate agents (such as Savills), car dealers, house-builders, and retailers. 'Recovery stocks have got to be companies which are badly hit because of management problems or the recession,' he says. 'I'll buy anything which is depressed and which I think will rise sharply.' There lies the risk for the recovery style of investment. 'If it is run as a genuine recovery fund, it either does very well or very poorly,' says Simon Atherton, of Barclays Unicorn. 'But the main attraction of these funds is the speed with which they deliver capital performance once there is a change in the economy.' The spur to improved performance figures in the year to February was the UK's exit from the exchange rate mechanism. In the past, cyclical stocks have benefited from the devaluation of sterling as the UK comes out of recession - a process unlikely to have been repeated while the UK remained within the ERM. 'Coming out was the best thing to have happened to recovery stocks for a long while,' says Hughes. 'Stocks which were struggling suddenly became more attractive.' Can it last? Recovery stocks should do well if there is a sustained recovery in the economy. For the first five months of last year, they showed a brief upswing, only to fall back in the summer as the government affirmed its commitment to the ERM. But if the economy is emerging from the latest recession, they should perform strongly over a substantial period. 'Companies which had problems before the recession, but have managed to last this long, are likely to see their fortunes get dramatically better,' says Clapp. Hughes adds: 'The upswing may not have started now but, when it does, I would expect it to last for three to four years.' Recovery funds are likely to appeal only to those with strong nerves, though. 'They are suitable for long-term investors who are willing to sweat out the dips,' says Hughes. In theory, smart investors buy into them as the economy begins to recover and sell as it enters the next recession. But, as Hughes points out: 'The problem is that no one spots the bottom.' Long-term investors should be rewarded, however. 'Recovery funds should outperform the index in the long-term to justify their existence,' says Hugo Tudor, manager of Schroder's institutional recovery fund. The table shows that six of the eight recovery funds in the 10 years to February outperformed the FT Ordinary share index, while half beat the average for the UK growth sector over the same period.</p>

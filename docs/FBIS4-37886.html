			<p>BFN     [Text] Tehran, June 25 (AFP) -- A Russian special  presidential envoy discussed the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict with  Iranian officials here Saturday [25 June], Russian sources said.    Vladimir Kazimirov, who heads Russia's efforts to mediate  between Azerbaijan and Armenia, met Morteza Bank, an Iranian  foreign ministry expert on the Caucasus region, and was  "satisfied" with Iran's response to a peace plan proposed by  Russia last month, the sources said.    Armenia has accepted the plan to end the six-year conflict,  but Azerbaijan has rejected it.    Iran, which made several unsuccessful attempts to broker an  end to the conflict in the past, said it would work with Russia  to restore peace in Nagorno-Karabakh.    Nearly 20,000 people have died in fighting since the  Christian Armenian majority in the enclave declared secession  from Moslem Azerbaijan in 1988.    Azerbaijani President Geydar Aliyev is due to visit Iran on  Wednesday [29 June].    Tehran and Moscow were likely to continue talks on the  conflict in Moscow, the Russian sources said.</p>

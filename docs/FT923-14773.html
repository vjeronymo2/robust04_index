			<p>920706 FT  06 JUL 92 / Thailand scraps deal to build elevated railway THE THAI authorities have cancelled an agreement with a consortium led by SNC-Lavalin of Canada to build a Dollars 2.6bn (Pounds 1.4bn) elevated railway system known as Skytrain, one of a series of mass transit projects designed to alleviate traffic congestion in Bangkok. In Montreal at the weekend, the SNC group confirmed that the Expressway and Rapid Transit Authority of Thailand (ETA) had declared void an agreement signed in February to build the Skytrain, but it said SNC-Lavalin would continue negotiations with the ETA in an attempt to reach satisfactory terms. The Skytrain is the oldest of three planned elevated railway systems for Bangkok and the idea dates back 17 years. Construction for the other two projects - a Dollars 3.2bn combination of property development, roads and rail lines being undertaken by Hopewell of Hong Kong, and a Dollars 700m elevated rail system proposed by local property developer Tanayong - is expected to begin soon, according to the heads of the two companies. ETA officials in Bangkok said the SNC-Lavalin consortium had failed to meet a June 22 deadline for the various proposed Skytrain investors to sign an agreement on subscriptions to the project's Dollars 400m equity. They also complained that SNC-Lavalin wanted to renegotiate the February contract to include new guarantees for the investors. Members of the SNC-Lavalin consortium in Bangkok declined to comment directly on the ETA's decision, but one executive suggested that opponents of Skytrain were claiming that the system would not have enough capacity to meet demand. 'It's the perception of people on what light rail is and what heavy rail is,' he said. 'The vehicles are light but the capacity is heavy.' SNC-Lavalin apparently faces more fundamental problems, however, including the difficulty of raising loans for the project after the political violence in Thailand in May, and the reluctance of some members of the consortium to subscribe to their proposed equity shares. Thai newspapers said at the weekend that the government of Mr Anand Panyarachun, the interim prime minister, was likely to make a final decision on the matter at a cabinet meeting tomorrow . The government could call for new bids on the Skytrain project.</p>

			<p>931029 FT  29 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Identity cards to be welcomed Sir, You report, 'Benefit fraud costs Pounds 5bn a year, say officials' (October 26), that the government is considering the introduction of identity cards for benefit claimants to reduce fraudulent claims. Such a measure could have much wider advantages in industry, particularly if it is the first step to the introduction of a universal identity card. As an industry with many thousands of employees and a turnover of more than Pounds 1.5bn, members of this association would welcome such an initiative. Our member companies, which have to abide by a code of practice as a condition of membership, work under increasing burdens to ensure the propriety of their employees. They have long been frustrated by the lack of adequate means of checking the credentials of potential employees, particularly in regard to the status of foreign nationals, National Insurance and tax. Any initiative which makes such checks easier and more effective, reducing administrative burdens while improving the accuracy of checks on potential employees, should be widely welcomed throughout industry. Michael B Heath, director general, Cleaning and Support Services Association, Suite 73/74, The Hop Exchange, 24 Southwark Street, London SE1 1TY</p>

			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / Company car tax changes proposed MORE THAN 200,000 UK executives driving high-specification company cars face steep increases in their income tax bills under proposals announced by the Inland Revenue yesterday. They face a 40 per cent rise in the tax payable on the private benefit of their cars, under the proposals for a system based mainly on 12 price bands. But the Revenue claims that 1.2m out of a total of 1.9m company car drivers would benefit from a revised structure for company car taxation set out in a consultative document. Their tax bills could fall by up to 25 per cent under the review, foreshadowed by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, in his 1992 Budget. The Revenue is aiming to create a fairer company car taxation structure while encouraging businesses to use more fuel-efficient vehicles. It is partly a response to persistent claims by business that the current system, based on a combination of only five price and engine size bands, discriminates against essential company car users in favour of low-mileage 'perk' cars. The existing system has also been criticised by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission for distorting the new car market by causing bunching of models just below the price and engine size breakpoints. At the heart of the Revenue's proposed system are a dozen new bands, based wholly on price and stretching up to Pounds 60,000. Apart from engine capacity bands, the current system, described as outdated and crude by the Revenue, has only two price thresholds, at Pounds 19,250 and Pounds 29,000, above which the assessed tax benefit to the user rises sharply. Launching the document, Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, said the current system 'to some extent fails the fairness test'. At its most extreme, it meant that the driver of a basic 1.8 litre Ford Fiesta diesel paid the same tax as that of a Mercedes 190. While the Revenue stressed that the proposals form only the basis of a consultation process, the essentials of the plan are likely to remain largely intact when the final scheme is announced by Mr Lamont in his Budget speech in the spring. It is expected that the revised system will not be introduced before the spring of 1994, to avoid creating further uncertainty in this year's already severely depressed UK new car market. The size of the increase entailed for many 'perk' users is expected to encounter growing resistance when companies begin seriously to digest the Revenue's proposals today.

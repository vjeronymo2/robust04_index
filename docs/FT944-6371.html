			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Customs faces 'big staff losses' Customs and Excise is to shed more than 4,000 jobs, unions said last night. The cuts form part of a 24,000 reduction in civil service jobs announced by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, in his Budget speech yesterday. Mr Clarke said civil service jobs would fall below 500,000 during the next four years, to their lowest level since the second world war. According to CPSA and NUCPS, the two main civil service unions, value added tax inspectors, anti-smuggling officers and support staff throughout the UK will be affected by the job losses. Customs refused to comment last night in advance of an announcement to staff today. The unions say the department plans to shed some 16 per cent of its 25,500 workers. It is understood that the jobs will go during a period of about six years, most of them eliminated by natural wastage, retirement, and non-recruitment. Mr Geoff Lewtas, CPSA's national officer for Customs, said the cuts would make it more difficult for workers to stop bulk drug imports. 'These jobs cuts will do serious damage,' he said. Last week the Commons Treasury committee recommended that the Customs service should deploy 'substantially increased' staff to try to stem the illegal import of alcohol and tobacco. Unions said the measures would affect 2,215 VAT staff, 755 support staff, 600 frontline officers, 355 EU revenue staff and 148 employees who compile trade statistics. NUCPS called the cuts 'short-sighted'. Mr John Sheldon, general secretary, said: 'The government prefers to run down our services, sack the staff, and sell off the profitable parts to their friends in the private sector.' The union said cuts in spending announced meant a freeze on pay for the next four years. Mr Lewtas said: 'We will now travel around the country seeking the views of our members, but as far as I am concerned, industrial action is on our agenda.' Staff plan protest rallies in London today.</p>

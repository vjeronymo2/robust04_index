			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with General Tadeusz Wilecki, head of the General </F> Staff of the Polish Army, by Miroslaw Cielemecki; place and date  not given: "The Army Practically Has No Commander Today;  Maneuvers"]    [Text] [Cielemecki] After meetings between Polish and  Western military commanders information is often leaked to the  press that the West will gladly admit Poland to NATO. Later it  turns out that no specific decisions are made after those  announcements are made. What exactly is going on?    [Wilecki] All declarations should be evaluated wisely,  without unnecessary emotions. Military officers and politicians  differ their way of evaluating certain phenomena. Western  commanders are pragmatic; they really are supporters of fast  integration of Poland with the NATO structures. Politicians,  however, act in the context of current configurations and  political situations. I am an optimist. Contrary to the views  expressed by some people, the "Partnership for Peace" program is  not a subterfuge of the West. It has drawn us closer to NATO.    [Cielemecki] Perhaps politicians are looking at the problem  of extending NATO to Poland as some kind of a stick against  Russia?    [Wilecki] I do not think so. Compared to Russia, Poland is  too small and weak to be used as a stick, as a bargaining chip.  I do not think that NATO politicians had such intentions.  Placing Poland opposite Russia would not serve stabilization in  our part of Europe -- either on the political or on the military  platform.    [Cielemecki] Janusz Onyszkiewicz evaluates that the changes  recently taking place in the Army management structures, which  limit civilian control over it, will prolong the Polish road to  NATO.    [Wilecki] I am able to understand the reaction of Deputy  Onyszkiewicz. Right now he is a politician of an oppositional  party. He is also the author of organizational changes which he  introduced when he was the defense minister. I must admit that  in many areas they were justified and rational. However, one  must also understand the needs of the Armed Forces, which must  be allowed a certain autonomy in its activities. In Western  systems these issues are not explained unequivocally as well.  Generally, I am a supporter of civilian control over the Army.  However, not only control, but also duties toward it. Civilian  politicians may display their skills and capabilities, among  other things, by constructing a broadly-understood defense  system.    [Cielemecki] What are the limits of the Army's autonomy, do  you think?    [Wilecki] They must allow it to be efficiently steered and  managed. Control over the Army must not mean tying its hands  and prolonging the decisionmaking process.    [Cielemecki] However, oppositional politicians voice the  opinion that Minister Kolodziejczyk has broadened this autonomy  too much, that he simply subordinated the Ministry of National  Defense [MON] to the General Staff. Is it true that the future  general inspector of the Armed Forces will be beyond any control?    [Wilecki] The Polish Army needs a commander for peace time  as well. Right now it practically does not have a commander --  the commander is neither a minister nor a head of the General  Staff. Such a function might be fulfilled by the general  inspector of the Armed Forces. At this point I would like to  explain one thing: I really am not "dying" to fill that post, as  some people think. The recent changes do not mean MON's  capitulation. Please note that the previous civilian minister  wielded enormous power over the Army; he took advantage of the  old legal regulations, in line with which this function was  fulfilled by the top-ranking general. Now, can a civilian  politician, who often does not even have the elementary military  education, command the Army? I do not think that we should  lament over the recently-imposed limitations of the role of the  so-called civilian section. They do not mean that the Army is  getting out of control. MON is managing, steering, and  exercising political supervision over the Army. Besides, there  is also the parliament, the president, as well as the Supreme  Control Chamber and the spokesman for civil rights. The area of  civilian power over the Army is still vast. One must say,  however, that this supervision is not always sufficiently  coherent.    [Cielemecki] What, then, should it look like?    [Wilecki] A debate on the defense system is being prepared  in the Sejm. If it is a substantive and constructive debate, if  all the problems related to the defense system are noticed, then  it will certainly be possible to agree on a coherent control  system. Its shape should be decided by politicians; they should  bear in mind the broadly-understood political and state interest.    [Cielemecki] Still, you and Minister Kolodziejczyk probably  do not think very highly of the competence of the Sejm deputies  who decide defense issues?    [Wilecki] Let us not generalize things. In the Sejm, in the  Defense Committee, there are many parliamentarians who know a  lot about the problems of the Army. There are also others --  for example those who have not done their stint in the Army and  their contacts with the defense system have been next to none.    [Cielemecki] When the fight for the budget money is going  on, the military men warn that the Army has found itself in a  critical situation, that it is simply dying. However, when the  context of the discussion changes -- when the subject of the  discussion is our rapid integration with NATO, which does not  need weaklings, it turns out that the situation of the Polish  Army is not all that bad at all. General, what is your  evaluation of the force and combat efficiency of the Polish Army?    [Wilecki] I am embittered that the civilian  decisionmakers, who should take good care of the financial  condition of the Army, are not fulfilling their tasks. We heard  promises that as soon as a civilian ministry was established, it  would be a guarantee of greater funds for the defense system.  This is not what actually happened. A modern army cannot be  built without money.    [Cielemecki] However, you have not answered my question  fully.    [Wilecki] It is not possible to make an unequivocal,  synthesized evaluation. The Army has not only good segments,  but it also has many weaknesses. Generally, it possesses modern  combat technology; however, there is too much old equipment. An  additional problem is that even though the limitations of Cocom  [Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls] have  been abolished, our arms industry is not able to immediately  manufacture equipment that would meet world standards. We also  cannot afford to import much armament. Such a situation --  before the industry adjusts itself to new requirements -- will  last several years. NATO has armies with great potential; we  cannot match them. However, there are also weaker and smaller  armies. I believe that our Army might already today be placed  among the medium-sized armies of the organization, perhaps even  a little higher.    [Cielemecki] Integration with NATO means first of all  convergent standards, technical compatibility, uniform command  systems, similar norms, and so on and so forth. However, it  also entails "compatibility" of a different kind -- of the  people, first of all of the generals and high-ranking  commanders. Most of them come from a different epoch, they are  saturated with different models of thinking, they cherish  different values.    [Wilecki] I agree that not all the people in our Army are  top-flight aces. However, the same is true of the West; in the  West there are weaknesses as well. I can assure you that we  have no reason to be ashamed of our command cadres. Now, as for  their mentality and habits, the art of war is the same both here  and there. Already now in many areas of a general nature our  Army is compatible with the Western Armies.    [Cielemecki] During exercises, on staff maps our own troops  and the troops of our allies are marked red and those of the  enemy are marked blue. As recently as a few years ago NATO  Armies were blue on our maps. Who is now playing the role of  "the blue"?    [Wilecki] Now we do not define our enemy that specifically.  During exercises, our own units fight against each other; they  are assigned appropriate roles. This is the best way to resolve  political dilemmas: Who is the ally and who the enemy.    [Cielemecki] However, any armed conflict has a defined,  political undercurrent. Is it not an oversimplification of the  art of war to eliminate this factor in exercises?    [Wilecki] The best art of war consists of the following:  Being strong, well-organized, and literally prepared for  everything. We adhere to this principle in building and  organizing our Armed Forces. We do not do this with a concrete  enemy in mind. We are rather interested in certain canons which  are binding in a given period.    [Cielemecki] President Walesa has often pointed at the  concentration of the Russian troops in the Kaliningrad Oblast  and called it a threat to Poland. How do you -- as a military  officer -- evaluate this threat?    [Wilecki] In line with the recently-concluded international  resolutions, Central Europe should be a zone without excessively  concentrated military units. The situation in the Kaliningrad  Oblast is really disconcerting and it should be thought over.  One cannot help asking the question: Does such a far-flung  military point serve only the military interests of Russia?  Well, but this is a dilemma not for the military, but for  politicians. In my opinion, there should not be such highly  militarized areas in the new Europe.    [Cielemecki] Two years ago a document called the "Polish  martial doctrine" was drawn up. Today it is mentioned  increasingly more seldom; its shortcomings are stressed. What,  do you think, the main defects of our doctrine are?    [Wilecki] It has partially lost its political validity. In  the substantive section, however, it is still valid and we are  taking advantage of it in the transformation of our Armed Forces.    [Cielemecki] Both Polish and Western commanders --  especially Americans -- have already several times said that  joint military exercises would be organized. Next there came a  rumble from Russia and the issue of joint military undertakings  was always moved to an indefinite future. Will they ever be  held?    [Wilecki] This moment is drawing near very quickly.  Appropriate decisions have already been made. This year joint  exercises will be held -- for the time being at lower levels.  These will be maneuvers with German, Danish, and French units.  The idea of joint exercises of aircraft and naval formations is  being entertained. I would not like to list any dates and the  scale of these undertakings, because detailed agreements are  still being discussed. It looks like we are also going to  participate in joint Polish-American exercises. We are  conducting an exchange at the staff level with the most  important ally armies. It is the requirement of the nature of  military cooperation that before the units of Poland and NATO  stand side by side on a training field, all factors be thought  over, including the training factors.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Unseemly Act of Puppet" -- KCNA headline] </F>   [Text] Pyongyang, May 28 (KCNA) -- The South Korean puppet  foreign minister, Han Sung-chu, recently flew to a Southeast  Asian country and entreated it to play "the role of a mediator  between the United States and the DPRK in the solution of the  nuclear issue of the North", according to a report.    Lurking behind it is a sinister attempt of the puppets to  create complexity by inveigling "a mediator" into the DPRK-U.S.  talks for the solution of the nuclear issue on the Korean  peninsula.    The DPRK-U.S. talks has not made a smooth progress because  the United States reversed the New York agreement and  deliberately laid obstacles to the solution of the nuclear issue.    There is no doubt that a bright prospect will open before  the talks, if the United States stop the international campaign  for pressure on the DPRK and sincerely approach the DPRK-U.S.  talks, though belatedly, and the South Korean puppets do not try  to thrust its nose into it and obstruct it. Hence, it is as  clear as noonday that no "mediator" is needed between the DPRK  and the United States in solving the nuclear issue on the Korean  peninsula.    Han Sung-chu, however, brought forward the question of  "mediator" who is not needed at all in the solution of the  question during his foreign trip. This shows well how  persistently the puppets are trying to put a spoke in the wheel  of the DPRK-U.S. talks again.    Facts clearly prove that the Kim Yong-sam group is, indeed,  a  group of traitors who are working round the clock to encumber  the DPRK-U.S. talks for the solution of the nuclear issue on the  Korean peninsula, roaming aimlessly.    The South Korean puppet clique must stop the anachronistic  act, squarely facing the trend of the times.</p>

			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / Books: Here's a how-de-doo] GILBERT AND SULLIVAN by Michael Ffinch Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson Pounds 20, 294 pages PENDING the archival biography of WS Gilbert himself on which an American theatre historian has been busying herself for a decade, here is yet another of those general books which from time to time re-scrutinise the Victorian collaboration. Smoothly written, Michael Ffinch's text incorporates a re-telling of the stories of the operettas and lengthy quotation from their verses. He is in no doubt that the dramatist was 'a far greater man in every way' than the composer. Such a judgment, however, assumes a musical competence not evident in an author who asserts that the title of Ruddigore 'is now often confused with Verdi's Rigoletto'. The profusion of superscript figures and footnotes (or rather back-notes) is, alas, a facade. With no scholarly evaluation of his sources, Mr Ffinch reinstates a discredited anecdote on one page, yet cites in another context the later work which did the discrediting. The fictional stories that Sullivan's grandfather rose to the army rank of sergeant and guarded Napoleon's heart on St Helena, and that Arthur Sullivan himself as a boy chorister sang at the christening of the Duke of Albany (Queen Victoria's youngest son) should have been nailed up for ever. On the other hand, the author has failed to catch up with recent discoveries about Thespis, Gilbert and Sullivan's first, 'lost' joint work. Repeatedly misnaming a character in The Grand Duke as 'Drummkopf' instead of 'Dummkopf', Mr Ffinch fails to perceive Gilbert's German joke. The misnaming of one of Sullivan's non-Gilbert operettas as Hadden (for Haddon) Hall and the misquotation from Trial by Jury likewise betray an uncertain foothold on the terrain. The nineteen photo-illustrations are well chosen.</p>

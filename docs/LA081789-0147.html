			<p><P> August 17, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: ALHAMBRA;  </P> <P> COUNCIL BACKS LIGHT RAIL  </P> <P> The Alhambra City Council has endorsed a Los Angeles County proposal to build a  mass-transit rail line in the San Gabriel Valley.  </P> <P> Council members hope such a line will help reduce air pollution and ease  freeway congestion.  </P> <P> The proposed rail system would consist of a light rail, or trolley-type  service, from Los Angeles to Pasadena, and a commuter rail service running  between Pasadena and San Bernardino. The transit system is required under the  South Coast Air Quality Management District's air quality management plan.  </P> <P> The system, which would cost an estimated $900 million, is awaiting approval by  the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission, said Susan Rosales, senior  rail development planner for the commission.  </P> <P> The commission will decide in March which of two light-rail routes through the  San Gabriel Valley should be approved, Rosales said. One route, which follows  the Santa Fe tracks through Highland Park, is favored by South Pasadena. A  second route, which runs along Main Street in Los Angeles before winding  through El Sereno, is favored by Alhambra.  </P> <P> The planned transit project is backed by the San Gabriel Valley Assn. of  Cities. In addition to Alhambra, Pasadena, Rosemead and Duarte have adopted  resolutions supporting the project.  </P></p>

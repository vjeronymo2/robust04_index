			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Zider to apple lager - country smocks to urban image / A look at the forthcoming market flotation of Taunton Cider TIME WAS when cider conjured up images of the rural English idyll; felt-capped yokels leaning on five-bar gates, straw between teeth and scrumpy at hand. More prosaically it was gentlemen of the road, or students, sliding comatose from their seats after availing of one of the most cost-effective ways of getting drunk. Neither image is exactly what the large commercial cider makers want. Over the past decade, HP Bulmer and Taunton Cider, the UK's two largest producers, have spent large amounts advertising an altogether different  - they say contemporary - image. Among their greatest challenges has been to make a cider that can be drunk in 'sessionable quantities', a piece of exquisite marketing-speak referring to the search for a cider whose taste will not stop drinkers in their tracks after a few pints - even if its strength will. While cider's image is far from reconstructed, the repositioning of the product appears to have been remarkably successful. Last year, when the UK drinks market shrank 5 per cent, cider sales volume rose by 3 per cent in spite of the bad summer and the recession. From a position of 2.5 per cent market share 20 years ago, one in every 20 pints drunk in the UK today is cider. It is into this background that Taunton Cider, the west country company founded 90 years ago, is to come to the stock market early next month. The flotation is likely to put a valuation of Pounds 130m-Pounds 150m on the company which its management bought from a consortium of brewers, including Bass, Courage and Scottish &amp; Newcastle, in May last year for Pounds 72.5m. Such a rapid transition, and at such a premium, might suggest that the buy-out team bought Taunton for a song. But Mr Peter Adams, chief executive and managing director since 1987 and one of the team that with employees put up 15 per cent of the Pounds 3.3m initial capital, insists this was not the case. 'At the time of the buy-out there was great uncertainty,' he says. 'We had broken free from our previous partners and there was concern over how well we could perform.' At the same time the EC was contemplating applying much higher wine excise duties to cider - a move Brussels has now decided not to make - and the Gulf war was in full swing. In any case, Schroders, the merchant bank, oversaw the trade sale to ensure the management team had no advantage. While the uncertainty may have been there, foundations were in place for impressive growth. operating profit rose from Pounds 5m in 1987 to Pounds 12.5m last year and James Capel, the company's brokers, expect operating profit of Pounds 16m for the year to last April. 'The sea change in the cider market came in the late 1970s when draft cider became widely available in bars,' says Mr Adams. Taunton's Dry Blackthorn and Bulmer's Strongbow began to grow rapidly, with Taunton increasing its market share from 18.7 per cent in 1975 to 33.4 per cent in 1991, compared to Bulmer's 45 per cent share. Then in 1986, Taunton launched Diamond White, designed to compete with premium lagers such as Holsten Pils and Becks, but with a significantly bigger kick. This was followed in 1989 with the launch of Red Rock, backed by an advertising campaign featuring actor Leslie Nielson, star of the US Police Squad series, that is as expensive as it is eccentric. Red Rock is aimed at the lager drinker and, Mr Adams says, lacks the bitter-sweet edge of Dry Blackthorn that tends to sate the palate too quickly for the sake of healthy sales. Cider's transformation to something the style-conscious drinker felt good being seen with is reflected in the premium ciders' share of Taunton's sales. Growing 20 per cent year on year, premium ciders now account for 25 per cent of Taunton's sales volume and 40 per cent of sales. These developments were taking place as the brewers' stranglehold on distribution was being loosened by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. The March 1989 order that there should be more competition between brewers and a restriction of the tied system gave the buy-out team the opportunity to go independent, with the prospect of a freer market for their product. Mr Adams then put his own bid together, backed by Samuel Montagu and Morgan Grenfell Development Capital, at the same time as he was supplying Schroders with the information other bidders would need for a trade sale. Barely 14 months after the successful buy-out, Taunton is ready for the market and hoping to float at a rating somewhere between Bulmer and Guinness at a multiple of about 16. The flotation is likely to raise about Pounds 70m which will be used to repay all Pounds 41m loan stock and mezzanine debt and all but Pounds 10m of bank debt, leaving the company with pro-forma gearing of 44 per cent. It is almost guaranteed to lead to jollity in Taunton where all but eight of the company's 500 employees became shareholders, albeit on a modest scale, in the buy-out. A rather larger glass will be raised by Mr Adams' management team which will be retaining about 4 per cent of the company.</p>

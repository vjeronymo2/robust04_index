			<p><P> April 11, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> OIL SPILL SEAS CALM; KODIAK 'SEEMS SAVED'  </P> <P> Rough seas that helped stall and break up some of the giant oil spill from the  Exxon Valdez became calmer today, and winds shifted away from fish-rich Kodiak  Island, the Coast Guard said.  </P> <P> "Kodiak still seems to be saved," said Jim Hayden, the state of Alaska's  cleanup coordinator.  </P> <P> Coast Guard spokesman Ken Freeze said the spill appears to have stalled and is  breaking up into tar balls. "That's better than ooey-gooey oil," he said.  </P> <P> Equipment continued to pour into the area aboard military transports. About 67  tons of material, everything from containment booms to absorbent pads, was  arriving today.  </P> <P> A huge Soviet oil-skimming vessel, the Vay Dagursky, is expected to arrive  Saturday, state officials said. The ship can skim 200,000 gallons an hour and  store 2 million gallons of oil on board.  </P></p>

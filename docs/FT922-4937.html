			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / Foreign Affairs: How to pay for eco-virtue - Freer trade would help to finance the agenda of the Earth Summit, which opens today Seldom can a meeting have been so long or intensively prepared as the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, alias the Earth Summit, alias Eco 92, which opens today in Rio de Janeiro. Seldom can any conference have been set so momentous a task. And seldom can expectations have been so bleakly and ruthlessly lowered. One could almost say that, since everyone now expects to be disappointed, no-one will be. Mr George Bush, 'the environment president', has no doubt done most to lower expectations by negotiating the draft treaty on global warming down to meaninglessness, and by serving notice that he will not sign the one on biodiversity, which he considers 'seriously flawed'. Yet, in a different way, those with a genuine interest in a successful outcome have also played their part. Environmental groups have done their best to make the public aware of the enormous gap between what they believe needs to be done to 'save the planet' and what is likely to be agreed. Similarly, developing countries have tried to keep the focus on the gap between the dire needs of their populations and the meagre level of assistance that industrialised countries are likely to offer. Some developing countries, it seems, have also conspired with the Vatican to prevent the population issue from being given the central place on the agenda which both environmentalists and many development economists believe it should have. This point has attracted the special wrath of Mr Helmut Schmidt, the former German chancellor. Last week in Queretaro, Mexico, I heard him deliver a veritable philippic on the subject. The preparatory material for Rio, he said, 'pretends there could be sustainable development and environmental preservation without limitations of the population explosion', thereby making a mockery of the whole concept of sustainability. At the same time, the industrial countries, led by the US, were refusing to commit themselves to limit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions 'in concrete figures of a clearly defined period and in a mandatory language', while the draft document 'Agenda 21' suggested 'unrealistic levels of financial resources to implement various environment programmes'. The effect would be to turn the conference 'into a bargaining exercise between two partners who were sitting in the same sinking boat, and threatening each other to open up the leaks on their respective side of the boat even more widely if the other does not start to shut the leaks on his side first'. Mr Schmidt's audience included a galaxy of other former heads of state or government from all parts of the world. These people form a select club called the InterAction Council, under Mr Schmidt's chairmanship, which seeks to distill their collective elder statesmanly wisdom for the benefit of their successors and the world at large. Inevitably, much of last week's discussion focused on the Rio agenda. Not surprisingly, Mr Schmidt failed to enlist his Latin American colleagues in an all-out attack on the Vatican. Nor were there many takers for his proposal that official development aid (ODA) should be 'made conditional on dependable family planning programmes'. This was partly because it seemed impossible to draw up clear criteria, but more fundamentally because many people felt the issue had a chicken-and-egg quality: while population growth is undoubtedly holding back economic development in many countries, lack of economic development is probably keeping birthrates high. Mr Schmidt did get his colleagues to agree to a final statement which deplores that 'the overarching population issue is not given the place it deserves on the summit agenda', and states bluntly that 'each developing country must: ensure access to birth control, education and services and to voluntary methods of contraception; extend education of all young people to the age of 14-16; place greater emphasis on women's rights and their employment opportunities and improve basic health care services.' And, switching the aid conditionality into a positive mode, it adds that 'where developing countries give priority to family planning within their own budgetary resources, the industrialised countries for their part should provide substantial additional assistance'. But where is additional assistance going to come from? That question hangs not only over the population problem but over the entire Rio agenda. The Queretaro meeting had before it the report of a 'high-level group', also chaired by Mr Schmidt, which pointed out that industrialised countries face 'substantial new claims for enormous financial resources, in particular related to environmental protection, development assistance, eastern European reconstruction and decommissioning of nuclear weapons' at a time when, if anything, the savings ratio of those same countries is shrinking. 'It is,' the report adds drily, 'a matter of grave concern that the largest economy of the world (the US) has for several years engaged in a policy of dissaving financed by the rest of the world'. Thus the Queretaro meeting concluded that 'major industrialised countries should pursue policies to increase public savings dramatically. National political agendas have to be changed towards sustained growth plus higher rates of savings. . . . Germany must restore its status as a capital exporter. . . . The US must tackle its deficits and reverse its growing indebtedness.' The more one thinks about it, the clearer it is that the financial resources so badly needed are not going to be available unless there is rapid economic growth throughout the world, and that the only stimulus likely to accelerate world growth is expanding world trade. This point was made at Queretaro by Mr Andries van Agt, the former Dutch prime minister who represents the EC in Washington. He quoted a report recently published by the OECD Development Centre according to which a successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round would unleash some Dollars 200bn in annual world income, of which some Dollars 90bn would accrue to developing and former communist countries. 'Whereas,' he added, 'dismantling all trade barriers would raise world income by close to Dollars 500bn annually - about half the income of the less developed economies or, in other words, the income of 3bn people.' The trouble is that things are moving in the opposite direction. Twenty out of the 24 OECD countries, we were told, have become more protectionist in the last five to 10 years - including notably the US and the EC. And Mr van Agt, fresh from the latest round of EC-US negotiations, said the Uruguay Round 'is still in danger of collapsing'. None of these thoughts is exactly new, and the political difficulties of acting on them remain as formidable as ever. But it is boringly true that the fate of the world's ecology, and of the 1bn people who already live in absolute poverty, depend more on industrial countries dismantling trade barriers and stimulating savings than they do on any of the specific decisions they are being asked to take in Rio.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video; from the "NHK News" </F> program]    [Text] Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura  commented this morning at a news conference on U.S. Trade  Representative Michael Kantor's remark that the U.S. Government  is studying the possibility of reviving the Super 301 provision  of the 1988 Omnibus Trade Act.    The provision stipulates retaliation against trading nations  that refuse to liberalize their markets or discriminate against  U.S. exports.    Insisting that such action would go against the spirit of  Japan- U.S. economic consultations, Takemura said he would urge  prudence on part of the United States.    [Begin Takemura recording] Our agreement is that we should  maximize our efforts at dialogue. I think what they are  proposing would go against the spirit of dialogue. I would like  to ask that they be prudent as far as remarks on exercising the  Super 301 provision are concerned. [end recording]    Takemura's comments indicated the government would ask the  United States to be cautious about reviving the Super 301  provisions.</p>

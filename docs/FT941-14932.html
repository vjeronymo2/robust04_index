			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / Arts: Belated homage to a fallen star - William Packer pays tribute to the troubled genius of John Minton John Minton was always something of a star. His rackety Soho life through the 1940s and '50s, his heavy drinking and frustrated homosexuality, to say nothing of his final despairing act of suicide in 1957, have all combined to confer a certain tragic glamour upon him. He was only 40 at his death, yet by then his work was in all the collections and it has continued as a staple of the modern British market. It would be wrong to think of his reputation as having sunk into obscurity, in need of rescue and revival: re-assessment, yes indeed; restoration, no. The only real surprise is that we have had to wait so long for any proper retrospective study of his achievement. Why this should be the case, and why such a show was not put on long ago by the Tate perhaps, or the Arts Council, is another story, albeit the neatest paradigm of curatorial prejudice and received wisdom in 40 years. It is enough, for the moment, to be thankful for the initiative of the admirable Oriel 31 Davies Memorial Gallery of Newtown in mid-Wales in prompting this elegant, celebratory selection of paintings and graphic work made by Dr Frances Spalding, Minton's biographer, and showing at the Royal College of Art in London. The circumstances of the life are, for once, very much to the point, although the work must be trusted to speak for itself. His more mundane commitments, to teaching and to commissioned illustration and design, have their own story to tell. Here was an artist as conspicuously successful as any of his contemporaries, and with private means. The Royal College is the perfect place for this celebration of his life's work, for he taught in the painting school up to the time of his death. It would seem that he continued there by choice rather than the necessity that, historically, has forced so many British artists to teach for a living. Did he need the social community and reassurance of the college to keep him going, to tell him he was not a failure? The trouble is that after a time, for a true artist at least, teaching may come to fuel those very doubts and insecurities it once helped to assuage, deflecting him from that central activity to which he urges others on so persuasively, resolving his own ambition vicariously in youthful successes. Anything is better than settling down in the studio, alone, to resolve the impossible. Meanwhile his students seem set on the rejection of all he believes in. By the mid-1950s abstract expressionism was sweeping in from New York, setting Minton at the college in famous confrontation with the likes of Richard Smith and Robyn Denny. Students sometimes seem a ruthless and ungrateful lot. Minton's illustration, advertising and graphic work gave him his wider audience, and here again the effect upon him was similar, if not quite the same; a willed device to keep him from the work that was properly his own, the creature of someone else's deadline. His graphic facility was as impressive as it was distinctive, his decorative judgment impeccable, his imaginative illustration full of life and wit - the show's lower gallery is full of it. Yet to turn there to the handful of life drawings, that we might expect to be the purest, most basic demonstration of his gift, is to be disappointed. The accuracy of hand and eye is undoubted, and yet there is a quality to it not of easy command and engrossed observation, but of stylistic self-consciousness, mannered and inhibited. Upstairs with the paintings, the case is more varied but essentially the same. Just as with the draughtsman, we find a painter of manifest gifts, who at intervals produced works of idiosyncratic beauty and true authority. The design is always sound, the drawing strong, the painted surface always rich in substance and never dull. Here indeed is a substantial body of work, yet there is to it, for all its qualities, a sense of irresolution and distraction. A theme is taken up only to be left off, a manner adopted only to be abandoned. Brave gestures are made, none braver than the late essays in latterday history painting in the grand manner, the Death of Nelson and the Gamblers at the foot of the Cross. Failures they may be, but bravely so and better than many a lesser painter's masterpieces. It was Turner's lasting ambition, too, to be remembered as the greatest of History Painters. This is all most difficult, as though Minton is to be celebrated by the very quality of his failure. Should he have reconciled himself to a career as a graphic artist? Of course not. Should he have stuck to the darkly Chirico-esque neo-romanticism of the deserted wartime street-scapes by which he first became known, or his later, brighter, more-mannered Cornish harbours and Thames-side wharves? Well, an artist must grow. What about the portraits and full-length figures in the studio? Of their kind, that of the critic, Neville Wallis, is the most accomplished, that of Kevin Maybury, the most formally complex and psychologically intense he ever did. Would that there were more. Who can say he should have done less teaching, or that his work would have gone further without it? There are those who require conflict and frustration in their lives and work. The tension manifest in everything he did is what makes Minton the truest neo-romantic of them all. It is only his premature death that we should regret.

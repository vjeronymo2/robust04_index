			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Ljubljana, 30 Jan (TANJUG) -- Vladimir Zhirinovskiy,  president of the Russian Liberal Democratic Party, left Slovenia  for Budapest this morning. He will continue his journey to  Belgrade this afternoon.    "I would like to show the Serbs that there exists another  Russia, a new leading political party, a new Russian  parliament", said Zhirinovskiy in his statement for TANJUG.    He hinted at "Russia taking a new stand in order that the  war  in former Bosnia-Herzegovina may end as soon as possible", and  so that "no Serb and no Slav would ever have to die in the  Balkans. The Balkans will flourish" -- was the message of the  leader of the Russian Liberal Democrats.    In the course of his official and unofficial meetings in  Serbia and the Serb Republic [in Bosnia-Herzegovina],  Zhirinovskiy is expected to put forward his proposals for the  settlement of the Yugoslav crisis, and especially for an end to  the war in former Bosnia-Herzegovina. Fully supporting the  Serbian and Montenegrin people, whom he considers as brotherly,  he will strongly oppose the air strikes on Bosnian Serbs  persistently threatened by the United Nations and NATO.    "My party and the official Russian policy will keep  demanding  that the international community abolish the sanctions against  the FRY and allow its return back among the recognized European  countries", said Zhirinovskiy.</p>

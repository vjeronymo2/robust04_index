			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / Allies seek four-month ceasefire in Bosnia Russia, the US, the United Nations and the European Union are to seek a four-month ceasefire in Bosnia as part of a fresh effort to resolve the Bosnian crisis through negotiation. As part of the deal, the US will help to finance the full complement of 10,500 additional peace-keeping troops sought last month by General Sir Michael Rose, the United Nations commander in Bosnia. The release of US funds will increase the UN force by several thousand troops, easing the peacekeeping difficulties faced by General Rose. However, no US ground troops are likely to be involved. Mr Vitaly Churkin, Moscow's chief envoy to former Yugoslavia, announced the establishment of a 'contact group' on Bosnia involving his country as well as the US, the UN and EU. He was speaking after a meeting with Mr John Major, UK prime minister. The announcement followed a day of consultations over Bosnia in London involving Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, Mr Alain Juppe, French foreign minister, and Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary. The meetings were a sign of renewed emphasis on diplomatic, as opposed to military, approaches to settling the Bosnian dispute. Mr Churkin's original programme called only for meetings with British diplomats, and the fact that he was received by Mr Major was a gesture of reassurance to Russia that it will not be excluded from peace efforts. The contact group is expected to hold its first meeting in London this morning. The group's priority will be to negotiate a full cessation of hostilities for four months, during which negotiations on a comprehensive settlement would be held with Serb, Moslem and Croat leaders. Earlier Mr Hurd told the UK parliament that General Rose must retain a veto over the launching of air strikes against the Serbs. Britain's strong insistence on the veto was in contrast with the position of the US, where officials have expressed impatience with the UN's cautious attitude to the use of air power. Mr Hurd said that under current arrangements for co-operation between the UN and Nato, 'either can propose air strikes, both have to agree'. He said this 'dual key' was essential if commanders in the air were to work in harmony with ground forces. Mr Jack Cunningham, foreign affairs spokesman for the Labour opposition, complained of 'considerable confusion' between Nato and UN leaders and warned that 'indecision' would only help the Bosnian Serb 'aggressors'. Mr Hurd refused to lay blame on any one warring party and stressed that Britain 'was not involved in fighting on one side or the other'. He believed the Bosnian Serbs were withdrawing all their heavy weapons at least 20km from Gorazde by tonight. However, he repeated warnings that the alliance could still mount air strikes.</p>

			<p><P> March 30, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MY BEST RECIPE: . . . FROM POTLUCK TO PICNIC IN A CAKEWALK  </P> <P> "Some years ago when I was a member of a Christian Women's Group in the San  Fernando Valley, we enjoyed many potluck luncheons and suppers," Yvonne K. Link  writes. "I was given this recipe for a lovely moist cake that is great for  picnics and camping trips as it is easy to carry and can be eaten out of hand."  </P> <P> </P> <P> PICNIC CAKE  </P> <P> 1 cup chopped dates  </P> <P> 1 1/4 cups boiling water  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon baking soda  </P> <P> 3/4 cup shortening  </P> <P> 1 cup plus 1 teaspoon sugar  </P> <P> 2 eggs  </P> <P> 1 1/2 cups flour  </P> <P> 1/2 teaspoon salt  </P> <P> 1/2 cup semi sweet chocolate pieces  </P> <P> 1/2 cup chopped walnuts  </P> <P> Mix dates with boiling water and baking soda. Let stand until cool. Cream  shortening with 1 cup sugar until light. Beat in eggs until smooth. Add flour  and salt. Add date mixture to batter and beat until well mixed. Pour into  generously greased and floured 12x8-inch baking pan or angel food cake pan.  </P> <P> Sprinkle over chocolate pieces, walnuts and remaining 1 teaspoon sugar. Bake at  350 degrees 45 to 50 minutes or until top springs back when touched or wood  pick comes out clean when inserted.  </P> <P>  -- YVONNE K.

V. Kuznetsov; UDC 519.717:621.39:534.782.001] </F>   [Abstract] Pulse-code modulated and delta-modulated signals  are used to represent speech signals. The Fourier spectra of  pulse-code modulated signals were analyzed; Hartley spectra were  also considered. The spectra were divided into frequency ranges,  or spectral coefficients. Three spectra types were isolated:  those with almost all energy at low frequencies, mixed spectra,  and those with most energy in the high-frequency range. The  number of coefficients which can be transmitted in one frame is  determined. Methods of decreasing the initial number of  coefficients are described. A graph of the signal compression  algorithm is presented. An algorithm is developed to compress a  delta-modulated speech signal: an Adamar-ordering algorithm is  used to represent a delta-modulated signal in the form of  coefficients expanded into a system of orthogonal Walsh  functions. The minimum number of spectral coefficients is  determined for which analog signal quality is not worsened.  Vector quantization and orthogonal Fourier, Hartley, and Walsh  transforms were found to be effective in compressing  pulse-code-modulated and delta-modulated speech signals. The  algorithm used to determine the optimal code size is described,  and the results are discussed. Optimal transmission speeds are  found to be 2.3-2.5 kb/s for delta modulation and 4.6-4.8 kb/s  for pulse-code modulation. Figures 4; references 4 (Russian).</p>

			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / Budgens cuts shops trading on Sunday BUDGENS, the small food retailing chain, will decrease the number of its stores open for Sunday trading now that rival food retailers are offering seven-day shopping. The example of Budgens was cited when leading food chains such as Tesco and J. Sainsbury started Sunday trading last year. Now Budgens will concentrate Sunday opening on stores where it makes sense for its customers - mainly inner-city sites and in holiday areas. 'In most cases, Sunday trading does not make sense. People will not eat or drink more, so you are just spreading the same trade across seven days,' Budgens said. 'People will realise there is a big hidden financial cost to Sunday opening. It means you need a different management structure, have problems with shelf-filling and repairs must be done at night,' said Mr John von Spreckelsen, chief executive. About three-quarters of Budgens' 95 stores, which are in the south-east of England, have opened on Sundays in the last year. Mr von Spreckelsen said the decision on Sunday trading would be made store by store, but he did not expect it would have a big impact on the results of the group. Budgens, whose institutional shareholders installed new management last April, yesterday reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.2m in the six months to November 28, compared with a restated loss of Pounds 33,000 for the same period last year. Mr von Spreckelsen described the results as a 'significant first step on the road to recovery', and said his three-year plan to revitalise the group was on course. Institutions injected Pounds 21.7m into the group last summer, after forcing the resignation of Mr John Fletcher as chairman. Sales rose 9 per cent to Pounds 156.65m. The group said this growth reflected the benefits of improved service and product availability from its Wellingborough depot and a one-off effect from increased trading hours. Trading profits rose 40 per cent to Pounds 3.26m, with operating margins improving from 1.6 to 2.1 per cent. The pre-tax profit figure was lifted by an Pounds 842,000 exceptional gain from a disposal in 1990 to Betta Stores. Earnings per share were 1.46p, compared with a loss of 0.03p last time. There is no interim dividend, as flagged at the time of the refinancing. Background, Page 18</p>

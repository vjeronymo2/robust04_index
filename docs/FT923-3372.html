			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / UK Company News: US side cuts United Biscuits to Pounds 70m UNITED BISCUITS' share price rose 24p to close at 259p yesterday after the group announced actions to reverse a steep deterioration at Keebler, its US snacks and biscuits operation. The fall at Keebler was the main factor behind UB's 17 per cent fall in pre-tax profits during the six months to July 11. Profits of Pounds 70m compared with Pounds 84.4m, while sales fell by Pounds 3m to Pounds 1.53bn. Keebler's trading profit fell to Pounds 12.1m from Pounds 29.7m on sales of Pounds 508.8m (Pounds 512.5m). All the other divisions matched or slightly exceeded the previous interim results. UB said Keebler, the second largest US biscuit maker, had suffered from 'extremely unfavourable market conditions', particularly in the first quarter. As well as recession, it faced fierce price competition, the impact of rival brand launches and trading down by consumers to cheaper products. Concern about Keebler's problems have led to a sharp fall in UB's share price in recent months. UB said it was reviewing all Keebler's operations and taking measures which should improve the company's performance by next year, even if the US recession continued. The recent closure of a California bakery would result in a Dollars 20m extraordinary charge in the second half but yield annual savings of about Dollars 9m from next year. Keebler's headquarters staff was being trimmed, though no big management shake-up was planned. UB said Keebler was putting a high priority on regaining market share. Since the end of the first half, sales had increased 8 per cent on the comparable period though little margin improvement was expected in the second half because of higher marketing costs. Keebler planned to re-orient its product strategy and to place more emphasis on supplying private-label groceries to US retailers. Marketing, particularly price promotions, was being reviewed to try to ensure money was spent more effectively. Mr Eric Nicoli, UB's chief executive, said Keebler remained committed to all its main product lines and was not expected to undergo any fundamental shift in strategy or radical restructuring. Mr Robert Clarke, chairman, said the group's UK and continental European operations had performed well in difficult circumstances. He expected no real improvement in trading conditions in the second half, and margins would remain under pressure. In continental Europe, trading profit rose to Pounds 10.4m (Pounds 9m) on sales of Pounds 191.4m (Pounds 167m). The increase was due entirely to a strong performance by McVitie's whereas KP's profit in the region fell 9 per cent, due partly to investments in marketing and distribution in Spain and Portugal. UB's recent continental acquisitions had all performed well. In the UK, trading profit edged up to Pounds 64.7m (Pounds 64.4m) on sales of Pounds 808.3m (Pounds 834.4m). Sales by both McVitie's and KP fell in the face of declining biscuit and snack markets, though KP's market share edged up slightly. Terry's increased profit slightly to Pounds 3.2m (Pounds 3.1m) on sales ahead by 11 per cent to Pounds 68.9m despite a further weakening of the market for boxed chocolate assortments. Profit at the Ross Young's frozen foods business held steady at Pounds 14.2m (Pounds 14.1m) on lower turnover of Pounds 268.2m (Pounds 291.6p). Earnings per share were 9.6p (11.6p) fully diluted and 9.7p (12p) undiluted. An unchanged interim dividend of 5.5p has been declared. See Lex</p>

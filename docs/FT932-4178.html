			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Blick rises 19% to Pounds 4.4m on back of communications side PROFITS AT Blick, the communications systems and time products company, rose 19 per cent to Pounds 4.37m pre-tax in the six months to March 31. The rise from Pounds 3.67m was underscored by the performance of the communications division which lifted its pre-tax profits to Pounds 2.86m (Pounds 1.61m) on turnover up at Pounds 9.52m (Pounds 8.11m). Mr Michael Lee, finance director, ascribed this rise to organic growth and the GPT contracts, the portfolio for rental and maintenance of public address and other communications systems acquired from that company in April 1992 for Pounds 3.8m. Mr Ian Scott-Gall, group managing director, said that satellite television contracts covering some 52,000 homes had been added over the past eight months, though Mr Alan Elliot, chairman, pointed out that this was through only eight customers. Pre-tax profits in the time division, however, fell from Pounds 2.06m to Pounds 1.51m on turnover slightly ahead at Pounds 6.78m (Pounds 6.55m). Mr Scott-Gall said that the causes were: the recession, given that the division has many small customers; the high overhead structure; stiff price competition; a squeeze on margins - many products are sourced in Belgium; and that the rate of cancellations has reverted to the levels of 1989. Future rentals under contract - 'the bedrock' of the group - grew 27 per cent to Pounds 85.8m (Pounds 67.5m). Cash balances stood at Pounds 9.65m at the period-end and Mr Elliot said that any acquisitions were likely to come in the communications side. Group turnover rose to Pounds 16.3m (Pounds 14.7m). Acquisitions - Electrelay, the car park equipment maker based in Northern Ireland, the majority stake in Databip, the French radio pager distributor, and contracts from Cheshire Communications for Pounds 2.1m - contributed Pounds 796,000 and incurred operating losses of Pounds 5,000, from a total of Pounds 4.08m (Pounds 3.42m). The interim dividend of 3.3p - up 10 per cent - was payable from earnings of 12.79p (11.52p).</p>

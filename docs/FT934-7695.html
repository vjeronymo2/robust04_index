			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of China (32): It will get worse - Pollution BICYCLES have been banned from the Bund, the highway along Shanghai's colonial waterfront, so that cars can move more easily. The image of hordes of Chinese making their way to work on bicycles is giving way to that of day-long traffic jams, which pump out a choking smog into the city air. That is just one symbol of the pressures which China's economic development is putting on its environment. In the past, environmental concerns have been low among China's priorities. But in the past year, Chinese officials and the World Bank have both warned that pollution needs to be curbed urgently because it threatens future economic growth. Shortages of clean water have already cut agricultural yields on millions of hectares of cropland and are pushing up manufacturing costs. Environmental diseases are a growing burden on public health programmes; lung disease, partly blamed on air pollution, was the leading cause of death in China in recent years at 26 per cent of all deaths. Government statistics, though incomplete, indicate that Chinese cities are among the dirtiest in the world. More than two-thirds of household and industrial waste water is dumped untreated into rivers, lakes and the sea. In Beijing, where only 2 per cent of household waste is treated, the eastern suburbs reek of sewage, while Guangzhou's canals bubble with methane from rotting rubbish. In northern industrial cities, levels of particles in the air, which cause breathing problems, are up to nine times higher than World Health Organisation standards, the World Bank reported last year. In rural areas, only one in seven people has clean drinking water. These problems, while common to industrialising countries, have been exacerbated by the route that China has taken to development. The sharp rise in its population to the present total of 1.2bn followed Mao's endorsement of large families between 1950 and 1965. The economy is only gradually turning away from highly-polluting heavy industry, still nearly half of industrial output. Moreover, the low energy prices set by the state have left Chinese industry inefficient. Consumption of energy per unit of output is high even by developing country standards, according to the World Bank. Coal, the single biggest culprit behind China's air pollution, still supplies three-quarters of the country's energy. The Chinese government has made some attempts to curb pollution during the past 15 years. It is hard to think of another developing country with a comparable array of environmental regulations, permits, and levies at both national and local level. Professor Ye Rugiu, of China's National Environmental Protection Agency, claims that these schemes have been at least partly effective: pollution per unit of output has not increased since 1978, in a period when GNP has grown by some 160 per cent, he says. But the schemes attract scepticism among some Chinese intellectuals and western observers. They point out that the central government's budget for fighting pollution is tiny: only Y11.8bn last year. They are doubtful that without more funds, the government's current campaign to shame polluters into cleaning up will be effective. (In the summer it published a list of China's 3,000 worst polluting factories, and last month launched a nationwide nightly television programme to celebrate triumphs of pollution control.) Perhaps the greatest problem is that regional and district governments often fail to enforce Beijing's policy. In the view of one western diplomat: 'I think they (the central government) are sincere. The problem in China has always been the disconnection between the provinces and the centre.' For a start, fines are generally too low to be effective in deterring pollution or encouraging investment in cleaner technology. In Tianjin, a fast-growing industrial city 100km south east of Beijing, the district government can impose fines of only Y50,000 on factories, and the municipal government fines only up to Y100,000. Mr Liu Jin Sheng, senior engineer with the city's environment protection bureau, acknowledges that 'the fines are low and need revision'. But local officials cannot raise the fines without authorisation from central government. However, tougher penalties might jeopardise economic growth and jobs. Faced with that choice, both central and provincial officials tend to choose growth and jobs. That preference is reflected in the lack of environmental controls exerted over the mushrooming township and village enterprises. Often using outdated, inefficient technology, their sprawling sheds and belching chimneys are part of the new scenery of the Chinese countryside. Yet they underpin much of the new provincial prosperity, and also have a central role in state plans for soaking up surplus rural labour and discouraging peasants from migrating to the towns. Given the shortcomings of China's present system of pollution control, the immediate prospect is that much of China will get dirtier as the economy grows. Informal government estimates suggest that China will burn 1.4bn tonnes of coal by 2000, a 40 per cent rise on present levels. However, structural changes under way in the economy could bring about longer-term environmental improvements. If the attempts to free resource prices are carried through, particularly in the case of coal, industrial efficiency may rise. Development of hydroelectric and nuclear power will also help, although it brings other problems: China's 'Three Gorges' project to dam the upper Yangtze river has attracted international criticism for the ecological and social disruption it will cause. Decentralisation may also give the provinces more responsibility for pollution fines and permits. Chinese officials acknowledge that foreign funding and technology increase the chances of this transformation. In securing funds, China may be able to capitalise on international concern about global warming. It made clear at last year's Rio Earth Summit that if developed countries wanted it to curb emissions from coal burning, they would have to provide the cash. But until these structural changes take place, it is hard to see China becoming cleaner. As Professor Ye puts it: 'We must simply try to slow down the rate of increase of pollution as China develops - but we cannot stop the development.'</p>

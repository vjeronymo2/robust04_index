These documents will immediately follow the appropriate  administrative procedures through the Attorney General's Office,  according to each case.    The public sector's suspension of activities, and their  negative repercussions for the population with less economic  resources, was one of the leading issues reviewed during the  meeting, according to statements made by government officials  and presidency spokesman Felix Loarca Guzman.    Loarca Guzman said the Executive Branch is still  particularly  inclined toward a dialogue, which was the intention since the  beginning, and the documents which certify workers have  abandoned their jobs are simply part of the usual legal  proceedings.    Meanwhile, labor leaders like Luis Lara, of the Health  Workers' National Assembly [Asamblea Nacional de Trabajadores de  Salud], maintain their position concerning the legality of their  measures and the fairness of their requests; adding that the  Executive Branch has yet to fulfill their demands although they  participated in a dialogue.    Hector Luna Troccoli, secretary general of the presidency,  reported that in the case of labor stoppages decreed without  meeting the legal requirements, the Civil Service Law and Labor  Code are applicable -- the latter in a supplementary manner --  aside from a specific decree which regulates the workers' right  to go on strike.</p>

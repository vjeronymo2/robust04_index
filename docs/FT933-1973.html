			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Output cuts seen as nickel price hits crunch point NICKEL PRICES have dropped below Dollars 2 a lb for the first time in six years and traders suggest it will not be long before producers make more cuts in output. Further selling yesterday drove the three-month nickel price down another Dollars 81.50 on the London Metal Exchange where the price closed at Dollars 4,265 a tonne or Dollars 1.94 a lb. LME stocks are at a record 112,000 tonnes and equivalent to about 18 weeks of consumption, compared with the seven weeks which is the maximum level for comfort. Much of the metal originated in the Commonwealth of Independent States, from where exports increased sharply after a slump in domestic demand and an urgent need for hard currency since the collapse of the former Soviet Union. According to Mr Jim Lennon, analyst at the Commodities Research Unit consultancy group, the nickel industry is going through a structural change associated with the CIS imports, which totalled an estimated 160,000 to 170,000 tonnes last year in a western market that consumed 620,000 tonnes. He said CIS producers had cut output by about 20 per cent in 1993 so exports were likely to drop to 130,000 tonnes. At present western producers planned to cut back by 10,000 to 15,000 but this would still leave a supply surplus. Mr Lennon suggested big western producers such as Inco and Falconbridge in Canada were reluctant to cut output because they had pared costs to the bone by stopping maintenance and investment to get cash operating costs below Dollars 2 a lb. The strength of the US dollar against the Canadian and Australian dollars had also helped the producers. If they cut production they would lose cash flow, market share (because they have very low stocks) and unit costs would go up again. Also, some producers had signed contracts to collect prices above Dollars 3 a lb and some smaller producers had hedged most of their 1993 production. The obvious candidates for cuts were the high-cost ferro-nickel producers in Japan (50,000 tonnes a year collectively) and Larco in Greece (16,000 tonnes).</p>

			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / International Company News: Exxon and Mobil lifted by marketing activities Exxon and Mobil, the two biggest US energy groups, more than offset lower earnings from exploration and production in the first quarter with higher profits in their refining and marketing activities. Non-operating items, though, led Exxon to report a 2 per cent drop in net income from a year before, while Mobil reported a 9 per cent increase. Exxon's results were hampered by corporate and financing expenses of Dollars 270m, some Dollars 90m higher than a year before. The increase was due primarily to foreign exchange fluctuations, the company said. The depressed crude oil price, which was Dollars 4 below its level of a year before, led to a fall in upstream exploration and production income outside the US fell 12 per cent, to Dollars 590m. US upstream earnings, though, were buoyed by higher natural gas prices and lower operating costs, and rose 7 per cent, to Dollars 245m. The lower oil price supported margins in downstream refining and marketing businesses, leading to earnings in the US of Dollars 39m, up from Dollars 21m a year before, and overseas of Dollars 349m, up from Dollars 277m. Exxon's chemicals business reported improved results, thanks to higher volumes and better margins. Earnings were Dollars 149m, up 21 per cent. After the foreign exchange adjustments, though, Exxon reported net income for the period of Dollars 1.16bn, or 92 cents a share, down from Dollars 1.185bn, or 94 cents a share, the year before. Mobil, meanwhile, benefited from lower financing costs, which dropped Dollars 35m to Dollars 73m, and a Dollars 12m fall in corporate and other central expenses. These factors were largely behind the Dollars 45m rise in after-tax profits during the period, to Dollars 535m. Earnings per share rose 12 cents to Dollars 1.31. Earnings from Mobil's operations grew only slightly from a year before, with upstream income falling Dollars 98m, to Dollars 335m, and downstream earnings rising Dollars 102m, to Dollars 236m.</p>

			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / Book Review: Flops at the top of corporate Germany NIETEN IN NADELSTREIFEN Deutschlands Manager in Zwielicht By Gunter Ogger Droemer Knaur, DM38, 272 pages The typical west German senior manager is male, aged 40 to 65, ambitious, incapable of real teamwork, insecure to the point of paranoia, incompetent and probably corrupt. So, at least, argues Gunter Ogger in a book which seeks to prove with a wealth of anecdote that virtually all top German managers are Nieten - 'flops'. The title translates roughly 'Flops in pin-stripe suits: the twilight of Germany's managers.' It is managerial failure, Ogger claims, rather than broader macroeconomic trends, which lies at the root of Germany's current economic malaise. This irreverent argument challenges the self-esteem of German business leaders who, until the present downturn, basked in the belief that they, more than any other class in German society, were responsible for the prosperity of the federal republic. As that prosperity has started to look fragile, and Germany finds itself in its worst recession since the second world war, Ogger's book has captured the mood of the times. It has become a best seller, appealing to the German habit of self-excoriation and providing a 'rogues' gallery' of failed business leaders. His argument accords with the views expressed by a small but vociferous band of shareholder activists who have been trying to start in Germany the kind of debate over 'corporate governance' which has taken place in the UK and the US. Whereas the mechanism of the hostile takeover serves to punish UK and US managers if they are slow to deliver short-term financial performance, their German counterparts are insulated from stock-market pressure by networks of cross-holdings and other devices designed to remove the threat of unfriendly take-overs. Only very rarely do these protection mechanisms fail - such as last year when Hoesch found itself being taken over by the rival steel company Krupp. But most big companies enjoy shareholder 'stability' which leaves managers free to treat private and institutional shareholders as little more than an occasional fund-raising source. The system also leaves managers free to pursue ambitious expansion plans without taking into account such pedestrian short-term considerations as profitability. Ogger cites the example of Daimler-Benz, Germany's biggest industrial company, where annual sales have expanded to nearly DM100bn since Edzard Reuter took over as chief executive in 1987 - but profits have dwindled to an expected DM1bn this year. 'Until 1985, it was the most solid, most profitable and best managed company in the whole of the Federal Republic of Germany,' he writes, 'but now Daimler is battling with enormous structural problems and must lay off staff for the first time since the war.' Another example is Mannesmann, the engineering group, where annual turnover has doubled to DM24bn under chief executive Werner Dieter, but profits have fallen to less than half their former levels. Such companies provide classic examples of how German capitalism has worked. Managers are appointed and their performance monitored by supervisory boards. The two-tier board system - which divides responsibility between the management board, on one hand, and the supervisory board, on the other - is often cited as an important reason for Germany's post-war economic success, worthy of imitation in the UK and the US. But Ogger contends that the supervisory board system has degenerated into a clique of some 200 ageing men working together to perpetuate each others' power and perks - a 'you vote for me and I'll vote for you' influence cartel which has failed to prevent poor management decisions. One consequence is the misallocation of financial resources - one reason why the German economy is heavily weighted towards moribund sectors such as cars and capital goods. The successes which the German economy can claim, Ogger says, are due not to managers but to well-educated technicians, craftsmen and engineers who build good products in spite of management. Drawing almost exclusively on secondary sources, Ogger's analysis makes no pretence of being fair. It is an entertaining harangue which might have been balanced by greater attention to the failings of the Anglo-Saxon system - for example, the questionable efficiency of takeovers as a way of dealing with managerial ineptitude. It does not tackle the anomaly that, although the shareholders are not the first priority of management, the German system can still produce superb returns for them. Allianz, the giant insurance company, pursued a questionable expansion policy throughout the 1980s and, until recently, put little emphasis on explaining itself to institutional shareholders. Despite this strategy, it was the best-performing German share over the past decade. Nor does the book offer any compelling solutions to the management problems which it identifies, beyond citing a few truisms imported from US management gurus. It suggests, somewhat forlornly, that German companies should try to become leaner and fitter and German managers more honourable and less bureaucratic. Sheer commercial and economic pressure, however, is forcing German companies to find their own solutions. Rationalisation has become the order of the day, as witnessed by Ferdinand Piech's tough regime at Volkswagen. Daimler's recent decision to abandon the holding company structure which served as its chief anti-takeover device and seek a listing on the New York Stock Exchange shows that managers will have to come out from behind the barricades if they are to have access to the world's largest capital pool.</p>

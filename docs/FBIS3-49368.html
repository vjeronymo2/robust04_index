Her mission is connected with the program of  "Partnership for Peace" put forward by the United States.    Underscoring U.S. merits in building democracy in Europe,  President Walesa said that, in his view as a former soldier, one  has to use favorable moments and apply a "lead forward tactic."  "I am of the opinion that there is a chance today for a leap  ahead in Europe," the president said. He added that, while  recognizing U.S. responsibility for the world, "we do not want  to hinder great ideas, but we want to present our stand."    Among members of the U.S. delegation is General John  Shalikashvili, head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the U.S.  armed forces.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis announced  that the Foreign Ministry will make representations to the  British High Commission and U.S. Embassy regarding the  observation of National Guard work at Larnaca airport by British  military personnel and a U.S. citizen. For this reason, he  added, Foreign Ministry Director General Tasos Panayidhis called  the deputy British high commissioner and U.S. charge d'affairs  to the Foreign Ministry. The government spokesman confirmed the  fact that British military personnel, whose number he did not  reveal, were interrogated by police for their observation in  Larnaca airport of an area where projects related to the  National Guard were under way. In this case, he said, a U.S.  citizen who earlier had met with one of the British military  officials also became involved. The area, he said, is not  prohibited, and initially it was not confirmed that anything  wrongful had been done. He added that the issue is under  further examination by the Ministries of Justice and Public  Order and Foreign Affairs. The government spokesman clarified  that the British military officials work at the British bases in  Cyprus and that they traveled in a car with regular license  plates. The U.S. citizen, though, used a car with diplomatic  license plates, and he might work at the U.S. Embassy. Replying  to another question, the government spokesman said that the  persons interrogated have not been placed on the stop list and  that they are free to leave whenever they want to. Kasoulidhis  said that no cameras or binoculars were discovered in their  possession, as was written in the press. He also said that an  investigation is also under way to determine how the information  regarding the National Guard work at Larnaca airport was leaked.  According to the government spokesman, the version that the  British and U.S. nationals gave is that it is their habit to  observe airplanes landing and taking off. Asked whether the  Republic's authorities accept this version, the government  spokesman said no.    The report on the action of the British and U.S. nationals  was exclusively reported last night by CyBC [Cyprus Broadcasting  Corporation].</p>

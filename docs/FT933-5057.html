			<p>930906 FT  06 SEP 93 / Pits attract few private-sector bids PRIVATE-SECTOR mining companies have made bids for fewer than half of 19 pits shut or mothballed by British Coal in its closure programme. The deadline for the last five pits to be put out to tender is tonight, with the likelihood that only one will attract a bid that involves mining. The five are Coventry, Shirebrook in Nottinghamshire, Taff Merthyr in Mid Glamorgan, Parkside on Merseyside and Sharlston in West Yorkshire. As the final deadline approaches it is probable that only eight of the 19 stand a chance of reopening as mines. The others have either received no bids or are the subject of tenders that involve the use of surface assets only. The government will use the private sector's lack of enthusiasm in its argument for closing so many pits. However, the shortage of bids will reinforce fears that the privatisation of British Coal next year will prove difficult. Although eight of the 19 pits may in theory reopen after the bids, it is highly unlikely that the market is big enough to sustain all of them. Some bids may be withdrawn and others rejected. Of the final five pits to be put out to tender, Coventry is the only one likely to attract a mining bid. Mr Malcolm Edwards, former commercial director of British Coal, is thought to be considering an offer. If he made a bid it would be his fifth for a mine being offloaded by British Coal. The other main bidder has been RJB Mining. It is not interested in the five pits in the last tranche after bidding for five of the first 14 to be put out to tender. Of the 14 the most popular is Betws in south Wales. Because of its anthracite household coal it has attracted bids from Mr Edwards, Ryan International and a management buy-out team. Markham Main and Rossington, both in the Yorkshire region, have each attracted two bids, one from RJB, the other from Mr Edwards.</p>

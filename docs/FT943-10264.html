			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / Abiola rejects terms of release Nigeria's detained opposition leader Chief Moshood Abiola last night rejected the terms of the military government's offer to release him. In a move designed to ease the country's acute political and economic crisis, the authorities had sanctioned the intervention of a high court judge. The judge, in an emergency session in the capital, Abuja, granted bail to Chief Abiola on condition that he agreed not to address political rallies, kept the peace and did not travel out of the country without authority. Chief Abiola, held in Abuja on a treason charge, was the undeclared winner of last year's annulled presidential election. He was not present at the hearing, but a spokesman for him said he had refused to accept the terms. The government action followed a month of mounting pressure which saw Lagos, the biggest city, paralysed, and vital oil exports severely hit by a continuing industry strike. Unofficial estimates put the loss of crude oil production at over a quarter of the normal 2m barrels a day. Anglo-Dutch Shell, which produces half of Nigeria's oil, has cut its production by at least 400,000 barrels per day. On Friday it suspended supplies of its Bonny medium crude oil, produced in the Niger delta at onshore fields exposed to vio-lence and sabotage which have been either threatened or carried out against strike-breaking. Oil prices fell sharply on news of the release offer. The key September Brent futures contract on the International Petroleum Exchange fell to Dollars 17.85 in late afternoon trading in London, down 57 cents a barrel from the previous day's close. A national strike, which began last week but was called off on Thursday to allow behind the scenes negotiations on Chief Abiola's release, was due to resume on Monday. This now seems likely to go ahead, with Chief Abiola and his supporters pressing his claim to the presidency, adding to the country's economic difficulties and raising tensions. Although Chief Abiola enjoys considerable support in and around Lagos, heartland of the Yoruba tribe, there is powerful opposition to him from the Hausa Fulani north and within the army itself. Mr Adams Oshimole, deputy national president of the umbrella Nigeria Labour Congress, had told Reuters news agency he understood that by the next sitting of the high court, set for August 16, the government would drop the treason charges, but military officials made no further comment last night.

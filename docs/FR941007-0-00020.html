			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Persons who can meet all the requirements for adjustment of status under sections 245(a) and 245(c) of the Act will continue to pay only the standard filing fee (currently $130.00 or $100.00 if less than 14 years of age). Section 245(i) of the Act also exempts certain persons applying under the new provision from payment of the additional sum. An unmarried child who is less than 17 years of age when he or she applies for adjustment of status will be required to pay only the standard filing fee (currently $130.00, or $100.00 if less than 14 years of age). The spouse of a legalized alien or the unmarried child under 21 years of age of a legalized alien will also be required to pay only the standard filing fee (currently $130.00, or $100.00 if less than 14 years of age), if the spouse or child qualifies for and has applied for voluntary departure under the family unity program established by section 301(a) of the Immigration Act of 1990. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This additional sum is a penalty dictated by section 245(i) of the Act; therefore, payment of the additional sum will not be waived, except as directed in section 245(i) of the Act. Also, fee waivers may be granted under 8 CFR 103.7(c) only if the applicant substantiates his or her inability to pay the prescribed fee. Since a person applying for adjustment of status under section 245 of the Act is required to show financial resources or income establishing that he or she is not likely to become a public charge in the United States, a person who can establish a basis for waiving payment of the additional sum would be unlikely to be eligible for adjustment of status under section 245 of the Act. The few adjustment provisions that waive the public charge exclusion ground for a person seeking adjustment of status under section 245 of the Act also provide other waivers that eliminate any need for the applicant to seek the benefits of section 245(i) of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 --> Application <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Each person applying for adjustment of status under section 245 of the Act, including a child, must complete Form I&hyph;485. Each applicant must also compile the initial evidence required by that form's instructions. Supplement A to Form I&hyph;485 (Supplement A) may then be completed to determine whether the applicant must file under section 245(i) of the Act and whether the additional sum must be paid. This supplementary form asks several questions and provides instructions that allow the applicant to decide whether he or she must submit Supplement A and whether an additional sum must be paid. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Each person, including a child, whose eligibility for adjustment of status is based on the provisions of section 245(i) of the Act must file Supplement A. The Form I&hyph;485 with fee and the Supplement A with any required additional sum must be filed with the office having jurisdiction over the applicant's place of residence. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 --> Beginning of Application Period <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Section 506(c) of Pub. L. 103&hyph;317 states that ``(t)he provisions of these amendments to the Immigration and Nationality Act shall take effect on October 1, 1994.'' These amendments to the Act are not retroactive and cannot be applied to applications for adjustment of status filed before that date. They also cannot be applied to a motion to reopen or reconsider an adjustment of status application if the underlying adjustment application was filed before October 1, 1994. An intending immigrant is not, however, precluded from obtaining the benefits of the new law merely because he or she previously sought to adjust status. If the person meets the requirements for adjustment of status under the provisions of the new section 245(i) of the Act, he or she may file a new application for adjustment of status with fee, accompanied by Supplement A and any required additional sum. The applicant must show that he or she has an immigrant visa number immediately available and meets all other applicable requirements of section 245 of the Act on the date the new application is filed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

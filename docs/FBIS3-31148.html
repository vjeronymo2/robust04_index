			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From BTA press review] </F>   [Text] Sofia, February 10 (BTA) -- "MP's say that  according to number one spy Brigo Asparukhov the air strikes  against Bosnia are the greatest threat to Bulgaria's national  security in 50 years," the private 24 CHASA daily writes in an  extensive front-page article. Mr. Asparukhov, head of the  National Intelligence Service, reportedly said so at yesterday's  meeting of the Parliamentary National Security Committee, which  according to the parliamentary rules of procedures holds its  sittings behind closed doors. 24 CHASA quotes the committee's  chairman, Mr. Nikolay Slatinski, as saying: "If Turkey chooses  to get involved in the conflict, it will not be allowed to use  Bulgaria's territory." The daily reminds that on Monday  President Zhelyu Zhelev received a letter from Turkey's  President Demirel, asking him to back NATO's strike in Bosnia.  "Until late last night the president had not given an answer,"  the daily reports. "Why does President Zhelev pass over Brigo  Asparukhov's warning in silence?" the daily asks. In a signed  commentary the private KONTINENT daily writes that Bulgaria's  reaction must be swift and categorical, otherwise before long  its foreign policy will be dictated by Ankara. Under the  headline "Politicians Diverge on Yugo-Policy" the DUMA daily of  the Bulgarian Socialist Party writes that the members of the  Parliamentary National Security Committee were perplexed by the  statement of Deputy Minister of Defence Boyko Noev that limited  air strikes against Bosnia pose no immediate threat to  Bulgaria's national security.    All papers frontpage reports on NATO's decision to give the  Serbs a ten-day ultimatum to lift the siege of Sarajevo. "Thank  God the World Overcame the Threat of Another Bloody conflict,"  reads a headline in the independent OTECHESTVEN VESTNIK. "NATO  Decided To Strike Serbs in Bosnia," writes the trade-union daily  TRUD. "The moment has come for us to say whose side we are  going to take," the daily comments. "On the one hand, those who  claim to defend democracy insist that we back the strike,  threatening that otherwise we will be considered anti-democrats;  on the other hand, brother Slavs warn us against such a step,  describing it as a betrayal of kinship and  good-neighbourliness," reads the commentary. "If we take the  side of NATO, we shall be on the winner's side when the war  ends. The question is, which war -- in Bosnia, Kosovo and  Macedonia or in Bulgaria? For, when it comes to the crunch, the  Serbs will hardly hesitate to blast the Balkans," writes TRUD.  "And if we turn against NATO, we'll get a "hvala"  [Serbo-Croatian for "thank you"], that is, a "spasibo" [Russian  for "thank you"], but we will be reduced to pariahs in Europe  for years on end," reads the commentary.</p>

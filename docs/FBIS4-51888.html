			<p>BFN     [Text] Police yesterday denied a news report that they  plan to arrest a former drug adviser to former US President  Jimmy Carter, who reportedly became involved with Burmese opium  warlord Khun Sa.    A newspaper yesterday quoted Lt Col Suphachai Sirisap,  deputy  chief of the Foreign Affairs Division, as saying police will  arrest Peter Bourne when they see him.    He also was quoted as saying that Bourne, a former adviser  on  narcotics to the Carter administration, appeared to have crossed  into Burma illegally from Thailand.    Bourne, 60, was relieved of his job as presidential adviser  on narcotics after allegedly abusing his position, according to  the report.    Lt Col Suphachai said yesterday he had never been  interviewed  as reported by the newspaper.    "I don't know about the issue at all. The report has damaged  my reputation," he said.    Suphachai said he told reporters that any country wanting  Thailand to arrest a foreigner must first contact the Foreign  Ministry, which would then inform the Interior Ministry. The  Interior Ministry would consider whether to order the Police  Department to take legal action.</p>

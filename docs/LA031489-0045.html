			<p><P> March 14, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO INDUSTRY NOTES  </P> <P>  Satisfied with leasing progress at its 20-story office building under  construction on the block bounded by B, C, India and Columbia streets,  developer Cabot, Cabot &amp; Forbes has entered the design competition to  develop the property northwest of the site.  </P> <P> Cabot, Cabot &amp; Forbes spokesman Gary Toler said the firm will submit a  design proposal May 1 to the Center City Development Corp., San Diego's  redevelopment agency, for rights to develop the block bounded by Kettner  Boulevard, A, B and India streets. Toler said the firm is under contract to buy  a 20,000-square-foot chunk, or about a third of the block.  </P> <P> He said CC&amp;F's principal competition in obtaining development rights to the  block is Ohannes Beudjekian, who controls 20,000 square feet of the property.  Beudjekian was not available for comment Monday. The remaining 10,000 square  feet of the block is owned by San Diego Trust &amp; Savings as trustee, Toler  said.  </P> <P> The CCDC will make a recommendation to the City Council as to which contestant  should develop the block based on their designs and qualifications. CC&amp;F  will propose an 18- to 20-story high-rise of about 350,000 square feet, a  building roughly the same size as the one under construction. That building, to  be completed later this year, is 65% leased.  </P> <P> If, after the CCDC makes its recommendation, the competing interests do not  come to an agreement on disposition of the property, the city could exercise  its condemnation powers in favor of the recommended party, Toler said.  </P></p>

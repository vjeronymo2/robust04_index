			<p>920107 FT  07 JAN 92 / Manufacturers in dark mood after false dawns: From cars to carpets, there are few signs of recovery on the horizon MANUFACTURERS had a bad year in 1991, and they are braced for little better in 1992. Companies from a range of manufacturing industries expect output to be further down on 1991 levels. Those looking forward to growth this year expect it will come only in the second half, if at all. Exporters expect a tougher time with slower growth abroad and increasing competition as Far Eastern manufacturers turn to European markets to offset sluggish domestic demand. Selling prices remain under intense pressure and investment plans are being reviewed. That is the gloomy message the cars, chemicals and engineering industries will deliver in the next two days. UK car sales were 21 per cent down last year, following a 31 per cent fall in 1990, according to figures to be published today by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. Yet 1992 will be a tough year although some senior executives have spotted the first glimmers of recovery. Car manufacturers largely offset the decline in the UK market by boosting exports, which were 70 per cent up in the first 10 months of last year. But slower growth in continental Europe and intensifying competition from Japanese manufacturers will make life harder for exporters this year. The chemical industry is expecting output growth of at most 2.5 per cent this year, after a flat 1991, according to forecasts to be published by the Chemical Industries Association tomorrow. Even this modest growth will depend mainly on the strength of the pharmaceutical industry, which should mask further falls in output from bulk sectors such as fertilisers and industrial chemicals. Most worrying of all is that investment this year is expected to be at best flat after a worse than expected 15 per cent fall last year. The engineering industry is in sombre mood, whether one looks at traditional metal bashing industries or high-tech aerospace companies which are facing cuts in defence spending. The Engineering Employers Federation says engineering output continued to fall in the last three months of last year. It sees little reason to expect much growth this year. The EEF forecasts a 2.2 per cent increase in the fourth quarter of 1992, compared with 12 months earlier. There is little prospect of growth in mechanical engineering, which may have to wait until 1993 for an upturn. The UK machine-tool industry, where sales to some motor industry customers were down 40 per cent last year, and construction equipment manufacturers, see no signs of improvement this year. In electrical engineering a year-end survey by Hoare Govett, the securities house, found that 81 per cent of companies in four main sectors of ing products, industrial products, power equipment and rail equipment - thought the sector was still in recession. But 62 per cent were more optimistic about prospects than they had been three months previously. They expected UK demand for their products to rise by 7 per cent this year after a 4 per cent fall in 1991. The steel industry, which is suffering fierce price competition from cheap imports from the Continent, faces a further decline in output from 16.3m tonnes last year to about 16m tonnes this year, according to MEPS, the Sheffield-based steel consultancy. The commercial vehicle industry, still suffering its sharpest post-war sales fall, also has little cause for optimism. Its customers are not planning to expand - more than half the 240 member companies of the Freight Transport Association expect their fleet sizes to remain at 1991 levels. Registrations of trucks, vans and buses were down 30 per cent last year to about 190,000 after a 22 per cent fall in 1990. Exports, provided by large one-off contracts with Africa and the Middle East for some truck makers such as ERF and AWD, were buoyant. But that did not prevent truck, van and bus production falling to 172,577 in the first 10 months of last year, nearly 27 per cent below the comparable 1990 period and nearly 40 per cent below 1989. Most makers of trucks of more than 3.5 tonnes expect a small rise in sales next year to about 35,000, but warn that this will depend on whether a recovery takes hold in the first half of the year. The textile industry starts 1992 with only a glimmer of hope for recovery, after production fell 6 per cent last year, according to the British Textile Confederation. Sales were down 3 per cent. Even though textiles usually recover early in the economic cycle, particularly low-cost items such as lingerie, hopes that this autumn heralded an upturn have been dashed. Sales of high-priced items such as suits and coats remain depressed. The carpet market is also unlikely to show any sign of recovery until the housing market recovers. The construction industry is resigned to further decline this year. The only good news is that the decline will be slower than in 1991. The National Economic Development Council's construction sector group forecasts a lean year in 1992, with output likely to be about 5 per cent down this year after a 9.5 per cent decline in 1991. Industry spent most of last year apprehensively scanning the horizon for signs of recovery only to be rewarded with several false dawns. It is approaching this year in a mood of such sombre resignation that it will take a lot more than a glimmer of light on the horizon to lift its spirits.

			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / Drop in Youth Training uptake the government's main training scheme for young people - without qualifications and barely half go to jobs, according to the charity Youthaid. Latest government figures cover the eight months to December 1991 and show that the percentage of young people on YT fell from 38 per cent in 1990 to 33 per cent in 1991. The Department of Employment said it was difficult to compare 1991 with 1990, as measures of what constituted vocational qualifications altered in the period.</p>

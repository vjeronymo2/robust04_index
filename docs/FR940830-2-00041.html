In such filing, HIOS also included tariff sheets which eliminated its Interruptible Revenue Crediting Mechanism. On March 31, 1994, the Commission issued an order that, among other things, accepted HIOS' tariff sheets and suspended them for five months, or until September 1, 1994. As to the tariff sheets which eliminated HIOS' Interruptible Revenue Crediting Mechanism, the Commission provided in its March 31, 1994, suspension that they could go into effect on September 1, 1994, subject to refund and hearing. However, in its May 31, 1994, ``Order Clarifying Previous Order and Denying Rehearing'' the Commission clarified that the tariff sheets which eliminated the Interruptible Revenue Crediting Mechanism could go into effect on September 1, 1994, without refund condition and without being subject to a hearing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any person desiring to protest said filing should file a protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with Rule 211 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure 18 CFR 385.211. All such protests should be filed on or before August 31, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=3 --> Lois D.

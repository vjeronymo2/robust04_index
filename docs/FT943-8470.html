			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Bonds to balls and back again Sir, First Clement Crisp goes where no ballet critic has gone before. Now your erstwhile chief American commentator, fresh from reporting on the World Cup, becomes baseball correspondent ('Why the players complain it just ain't cricket', August 13). Brittan on badminton, Plender on parachuting are no doubt in galley proofs. Those hapless Italian treasury officials trying to flog 30-year Italian bonds will breathe easier with Barry Riley on white water rafting. Nigel Andrews escaped reviewing The Flintstones by a strategically placed holiday. Perhaps Arctic Dog-Sled Racing would be a suitable reward? That baffling acronym FT-SE is now explained - Financial Times Sporting Enquirer Adrian Jack, 2 Paper Buildings, London EC4Y 7ET</p>

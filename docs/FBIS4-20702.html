NICS first commenced operation in 1984, and thereafter had  both the types and volume of information it handled steadily  increased and its functions expanded to keep pace. However,  operability problems and the need to equip the system with the  latest technologies resulted in its complete reconstruction, and  NICS finally commenced full-scale operation in April of this  year. In addition to making full use of artificial intelligence  (AI) technology, the revised NICS features an integrated  database and unified operations.  <H5>  1. System Configuration </H5> <H5>  1.1 Hardware Configuration </H5>   Figure 1 shows NICS' hardware configuration. A mainframe  computer here at the Center serves as the host computer, and can  be accessed online via telecommunications lines from terminals  installed at nuclear power plants and the main offices of  Japanese power companies.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-019L-25A>      Figure 1. NICS' Hardware Configuration </FIG>     This host computer system is jointly utilized by users  outside the Center, but the system's magnetic disk storage  equipment, for reasons of security as well as maintenance and  management, are dedicated devices.    In addition to electronic workstations (EWS), NICS terminal  devices include printers for printing out textual data and  facsimile machines for reproducing graphs and other image data.  The telecommunications lines linking these terminal devices to  the host computer comprise ordinary 2400 bps telephone lines as  well as 9600 bps Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN)  lines (packet-switched telecommunications lines making up net 64  of the Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation's (NTT)  Information Network System (INS)). As of July 1993, there were a  total of 26 NICS terminal devices installed at nuclear power  plants and the main offices of all electric power companies in  Japan.  <H5>  1.2 Database Configuration and Information Retrieval Systems </H5>   Figure 2 shows the configuration of the NICS database. As  seen in the figure, the NICS database is comprised of  information retrieval systems and an analysis/evaluation system.  These retrieval systems extract information from the database  using terms and keywords designed for that purpose. Generally  speaking, the information retrieved via these systems is  unprocessed data stored in the database in the same format that  it was input. The analysis/evaluation system makes use of  operation/equipment/malfunction data to search for processed  data such as equipment/parts malfunction ratios, etc. In this  article, we will discuss the two new NICS database retrieval  systems put into operation in April 1993, G-NICS and ANIKA.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-019L-25B>      Figure 2. NICS Database Configuration </FIG>     Figure 3 shows the contents of the NICS database targeted by  these retrieval systems. The NICS database integrates eight  kinds of databases containing information on such things as  malfunctions at nuclear power plants inside and outside of  Japan. The following are brief summaries of these various types  of databases.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-019L-25C>      Figure 3. Contents of NICS Database </FIG>     Domestic Information: Four of the databases  contained in the integrated NICS database contain domestic  nuclear power-related information such as malfunction and other  such trouble information reported by the government, domestic  nuclear power facilities information and press releases put out  by the various electric power companies.    Overseas Information: The four remaining databases  integrated into the NICS database contain original language  reports and summarized flash reports, plus translated versions  of information from the Institute of Nuclear Power Operations  (INPO).    The Center has a well-established system for collecting  domestic information. Each of the power companies send  information on malfunctions or other trouble, plus operational  and maintenance data to the Center on a regular basis, as well  as each time an incident of some sort occurs. When it comes to  overseas information, the Center gathers that data from the INPO  information network system via international telecommunications  lines. And since the Center is also a member of the World  Association of Nuclear Operators (WANO), it collects information  from that organization as well.    Data input into the NICS integrated database is generally  done by hand, but English-language files received from INPO are  directly registered in the database via data collection  terminals.  <H5>  1.3 Information Advanced Application Functions (G-NICS) </H5>   The G-NICS retrieval system uses ordinary retrieval methods  to extract data via ``='', ``AND'' and ``OR'' operations.  G-NICS' special characteristics are its ability, based on the  integrated nature of the database, to unify screen operations  and to make cross-section use of the various databases contained  therein, and the fact that it possesses advanced diagram and  table preparation functions. The mouse is the primary means of  carrying out G-NICS retrieval operations, with keyboard input  being held to the absolute minimum. And to relieve the burden on  the host computer, G-NICS employs distributed processing  functions that divide up some of the processing workload among  terminals.  <H5>  (1) Retrieval Functions </H5>   G-NICS is capable of carrying out both ``keyword searches''  to retrieve data using keywords, and ``global searches'' to  retrieve desired character strings from descriptive texts. And  it is also equipped with a ``cross-section search'' function  that makes it possible to search for information in more than  one database at a time. For example, the cross-section search  function can be used to retrieve the translated version of an  overseas file from one database and the original data on which  that translated version was based from another database via the  same retrieval operation. Figure 4 provides examples of a  keyword search formula and data output.       -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Figure 4.

This  information can be output in either full text format or in the  form of selected items only.  <H5>  (3) Classified Total Function </H5>   G-NICS can use keywords to prepare classified total tables  based on vital data such as domestic malfunction/trouble reports  and translated versions of information received from overseas.  Then, based on this classified total table, this retrieval  system can prepare graphs and/or look at the original  information contained in the table.  <H5>  (4) Predefined Document Function </H5>   G-NICS uses previously calculated classified totals to  compile documents on domestic malfunction/trouble information,  and can display these as-is on the terminal screens, display the  information in graph form or output it to a printer for print  out.  <H5>  1.4 New Technology Application Retrieval Functions (ANIKA) </H5>   The ANIKA retrieval system makes full use of AI technology  to  simplify retrieval operations so that users can input  instructions in natural language. The user simply uses the  keyboard to input his inquiries in everyday conversational-type  phrases, and ANIKA decodes these phrases, automatically prepares  the required search formulas and extracts the desired data from  the database. Therefore, the ANIKA retrieval system puts AI  technology to work primarily in preparing the intended search  formulas based on analyses of the structure and semantics of the  conversational phrases input by users. This means that anyone  with a little knowledge of nuclear terminology can readily use  ANIKA to retrieve data from the NICS integrated database. And to  give the ANIKA retrieval system a ``personality'' to fit the  image of an outstanding information management librarian, the  developers of ANIKA gave considerable thought to the  psychological aspects of human-database interaction and equipped  the system with very ``soft'' and ``friendly'' greeting and  response statements designed to impart a sense of ``charm'' to  the otherwise dry, dull task of database retrieval.    ANIKA is equipped with search and original data output  functions, and is targeted at four of the eight NICS databases  discussed earlier, to include those containing domestic  malfunction/trouble information and translated versions of  overseas information. And ANIKA can both display retrieved data  on terminal screens as well as output it to facsimile machines.  Figure 5 provides an example of an ANIKA retrieval operation.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-019L-27A>      Figure 5. Example of ANIKA Retrieval Operation </FIG>     Right now, the NICS database system is using G-NICS as its  primary retrieval system, with ANIKA playing a supporting role,  so to speak. However, as ANIKA's sentence structure analysis  capabilities improve and its vocabulary increases, it is  expected to become even easier to use in future.  <H5>  2. Assignment of Keywords </H5>   The types of NICS data most often used by the electric power  companies are domestic malfunction/trouble information and  translated versions of overseas information. When it comes to  translating information received from abroad, the Center screens  all those English-language files received from INPO and has full  translations done of those files deemed important.    The Center has also formed a review committee that discusses  this information, and, based on those discussions, assigns  keywords to dozens of data elements. Assigning keywords to  information like this greatly increases the value added of the  original data, and, in addition to enhancing retrieval accuracy,  also enables the system to carry out various types of classified  total operations.    As for that information that is not assigned keywords by the  review committee, the system either assigns to the various data  keywords identifiable with each particular data element's  attributes, or automatically extracts and transcribes keywords  from descriptive items contained in the original information.  <H5>  3. State of Operation/Utilization </H5>   The Center was founded as an information center for the  electric power business, and therefore access to the NICS  database is limited to electric power companies only.    The hours of operation for the NICS database are from 8:00  AM  to 12:00 midnight on weekdays, and from 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM on  weekends. Operation is normally only halted on holidays, and the  one day each month set aside for database registration. However,  the NICS system is equipped with emergency start-up capabilities  to deal with emergencies that occur on down days, and an  emergency contact system is in place.    As for the recent state of utilization, G-NICS is being used  by all terminals combined an average of 130 or so times per  month, while ANIKA is being utilized to retrieve NICS data  between 20-60 times a month.  <H5>  Conclusions </H5>   Twenty some years have already passed since the first  nuclear  power plant commenced commercial operations here in Japan, and  the volume and types of information related to the operation,  troubles and maintenance of these plants has grown to enormous  proportions. It is extremely important that we put this  experiential data to effective use now and in the future to help  ensure safe, reliable operation of nuclear power plants and the  conduct of regular inspections with an eye toward economizing.    NICS has been supporting the operation of Japan's nuclear  power plants by accumulating data and using computers to make  high-level use of that data for almost 10 years now, and we  believe that our efforts have contributed in some small way to  preventing the reoccurrence of accidents and troubles of a  similar nature.    Everyday we strive to extract nuclear power generation data  more rapidly and accurately, and to incorporate the latest  technological advances into NICS, and if this article has  managed to communicate even a fraction of that effort to the  reader, then we will be very pleased.    In closing, we would like to take this opportunity to thank  Mr. N. Konishi (presently with the Japan Nuclear Fuel Co.) and  Mr. K. Sato (presently with the TechnoService Co.) for their  guidance in the development of these retrieval systems.</p>

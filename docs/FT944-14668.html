			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / International Company News: DDI rights issue to be largest since ban lifted DDI, a Japanese long-distance telecommunications operator, is planning a rights issue of around Y50bn (Dollars 514m) next month, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The issue will be the largest rights issue at market price since the Ministry of Finance lifted its ban at the end of last year. The ministry had restricted market-price public offerings since the market crashed in 1990. The company said it may offer around 60,000 new shares. Although the move will come after next week's listing of Japan Tobacco, analysts said the issue was unlikely to cause over-supply worries among stock market investors due to the small amount of funds involved. DDI plans to use the funds to invest in its personal hand-phone operations which are due to start next spring.</p>

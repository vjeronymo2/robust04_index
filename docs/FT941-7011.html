			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / Finance and the Family: Weak month for inflows into unit trusts - At a Glance January was a relatively weak month for inflows into unit trusts although they still retained their popularity with private investors. Net investment of Pounds 490m was almost half the Pounds 895m invested in December. Autif, the unit trust industry body, attributed the fall to heavy selling by institutions in the Far East for profit-taking after last year's strong performance in the region. Private investors accounted for a net Pounds 534m investment last month. The most popular retail funds were international growth and UK equity income funds.</p>

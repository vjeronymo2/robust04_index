			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / Finance and the Family: Recession puts a damper on M &amp; G's strategy - Recovery stocks are key to success, reports Philip Coggan / Doing the Splits THE M &amp; G Income investment trust was launched with considerable fanfare, including a TV advertising campaign, back in October 1991. The issue was an enormous success; the Pounds 246m it raised made it the biggest trust launch in history. Eighteen months later, investors may well be wondering if the fuss was worth it. The packaged shares, which were bought by around 59 per cent of investors, stand at just 103p - only 3 per cent above the offer price. Manager John Allard admits that, with hindsight, the fund was launched too early. 'We didn't think the recession was going to last as long as it did,' he says. M &amp; G's investment philosophy is built round the contrarian approach. Buy shares when they have a high yield, or their depressed prices make them recovery stocks, and eventually they will rebound to your profit. That theory has worked very well in the long run, but it is a high-risk strategy in the middle of a recession. At such times, corporate profits turn out to be worse than the market expects. The Income trust was a prime example of the M &amp; G philosophy in action. Aimed at giving investors a 6.6 per cent yield (tax-free when held in personal equity plan form), the trust needed a portfolio yield of 7.5 per cent-plus. That, inevitably, involved buying some high-risk stocks. What did not help is that, shortly after the trust's launch, the market decided recovery was not under way and, furthermore, feared a Labour election victory. Investors moved into the perceived safety of growth stocks, such as Glaxo and Wellcome, and away from the high-yielders. M &amp; G Income's portfolio suffered accordingly. But Black Wednesday, and the subsequent declines in interest rates, have helped. Before the pound's exit from the ERM, the trust's net asset value fell 17.8 per cent while the All-Share fell by 9.3 per cent. After devaluation, though, the trust's assets have risen 34.5 per cent while the All-Share has risen only 24.2 per cent. Investors have not seen the full benefit of this recent recovery since the price of the packaged units has recently dropped from a premium to net asset value to a discount. M&amp;G blames the Budget's effect on the popularity of its income shares for the switch. Allard says the yield on the portfolio is now down to 5.5 per cent and, during the year, he will be selling some of the successful low-yielding stocks and moving into the high-yield end of the market. The trust has a 6 per cent holding of gilts which helps to provide income. The 10 largest stocks in the portfolio are BAT, British Gas, General Accident, GEC, GKN, Standard Chartered, Scottish Power, Royal Bank of Scotland, Morgan Crucible and NatWest. Five different types of security are traded. The zero dividend preference shares receive no income but have the first claim on the assets of the trust. Shareholders will be entitled to be repaid at 102.46p in November 2001. Compared with the original net asset value of 34.5p, this is equivalent to a gross redemption yield of 11.5 per cent per annum. Philip Middleton, investment trust analyst at Smith New Court, says the zeros are among the riskier in the sector, since the assets of the trust are now only just enough to cover full repayment. The present gross redemption yield, at 50p, is around 8.7 per cent. The income shares are entitled to all the revenue of the trust, but will be repaid only at 0.1p per share on wind-up in 2001. They resemble an annuity in that investors receive a high income at the expense of capital loss. In the first year of the trust, the gross dividend was 6.55p, equal to the prospectus forecast. The trust has indicated it expects to be able to maintain the net dividend this year, helped by revenue reserves from last year. But the Budget change in advance corporation tax, which reduced the tax credit on dividends, means that the gross dividend will fall, to around 6.14p. On that basis, the shares, at 36p are on a flat yield of 17 per cent. Since their capital value dwindles to virtually zero by 2001, however, Middleton says the gross redemption yield is lower, at 9.8 per cent, assuming nil dividend growth. He feels that these shares are on the cheap side since they offer a good spread over the equivalent gilts, plus some protection against a renewal of inflation, which would lead to an increase in dividend income. The capital shares receive no income but can claim all the assets of the trust once the zero dividend and income shares have been repaid. Middleton says the trust's assets will need to grow at 1.5 per cent a year for investors to get back the present share price of 17p. If the assets grow at 5 per cent a year, the return to investors would be 15 per cent, although he points out the high portfolio yield will restrict the prospects for capital growth. He feels the capital shares are trading above their fair value. In addition to the three individual classes of share, the trust also created two combinations of securities. The packaged units consist of one zero dividend preference, one income and one capital share and, to most intents and purposes, are just like ordinary shares in a conventional investment trust. Those private investors who bought into the trust via the personal equity plan will have received packaged units. There are also geared ordinary units which consist of one income and one capital share. These accordingly receive a high level of income (the present yield is 11.6 per cent) but have the chance of capital growth. Middleton says it is important that investors do not get too caught up in the mathematical calculations. The key to the success of the trust is that recovery stocks continue their recent outperformance. Key facts The trust has assets of Pounds 263.5m and is due to be wound up in 2001. The manager's annual fee is 0.75 per cent of assets minus current liabilities; half this fee is charged to income and half to capital. Board The chairman is Paddy Linaker, deputy chairman and group managing director of M &amp; G. Other M &amp; G staff on the board are John Allard and Anthony Shearer. Outside directors are Bryan Hines, former general manager of ICI's insurance and investments group; Donald Macpherson, deputy chairman of County NatWest; and Neil Shaw, chairman of Tate &amp; Lyle. Savings plan and Pep details The Pep was designed specifically for the trust's launch and is no longer on offer, although investors could put trust shares into a self-select Pep. There is no savings scheme.</p>

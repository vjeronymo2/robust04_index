			<p>930510 FT  10 MAY 93 / Close contest in Paraguay election THE three leading candidates in yesterday's presidential and congressional elections in Paraguay were neck and neck as voting finished, and all parties were celebrating victory. According to one TV exit poll, the ruling Colorado party won 31 per cent of the vote for their candidate, Mr Juan Carlos Wasmosy, with Mr Domingo Laino of the Authentic Liberal Radical party gaining 29 per cent, and Mr Guillermo Caballero Vargas, of the newly formed, pro-business Encuentro Nacional, 28 per cent. The poll also suggests the Colorado party will continue to be the largest in Congress. Another poll, however, gave Mr Laino the lead with 35 per cent, Mr Wasmosy 34 and Mr Caballero Vargas 30. The differences in the showing of the three candidates are well within the margin of error of the polls. About 200 international observers are in Paraguay for the elections. Some irregularities were noted in the run-up to voting but were considered unlikely to affect the result. A close result could trigger a period of uncertainty in Paraguay. The Colorado party has ruled since 1947 in league with the army, and there have been doubts whether the military would allow power to pass to another party. During the dictatorship of General Alfredo Stroessner the army was used to mobilise voting in rigged elections. An organisation carrying out a parallel count of votes yesterday had its telephone lines cut, badly delaying the process. Although some fraud was regarded as inevitable in yesterday's election, opposition candidates might not accept the result should it be close.</p>

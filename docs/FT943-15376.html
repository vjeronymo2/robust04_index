			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Switching in banks continues Royal Bank of Scotland and NatWest Bank captured the top two places in the London market's list of active stocks with some dealers taking the view that the big seller of RBOS stock on Thursday had quickly pumped some of the money back into the market through NatWest purchases. The residue of the RBOS stock acquired by Smith New Court in a bought deal on Thursday was said to have been placed fairly quickly yesterday morning, with turnover of 26m in RBOS confirming the deal was completed. Smith was thought to have paid 408p for the stock. RBOS shares languished around the 409p mark for much of the morning before rallying to 414p and eventually settling a net 8 off at 410p. Rumours circulating yesterday suggested that Morgan Grenfell was the seller of the RBOS stock. One buyer then moved in to pick up 5m NatWest at 434p. At the close NatWest were unchanged at 435p. Turnover in the stock reached a hefty 16m shares, the heaviest single-day's business since February 23. Bargain-hunting for hotels group Forte saw the shares recover some ground from an early retreat, after NatWest Securities placed the stock on the sell list from its previous hold recommendation. This follows similar advice to investors from BZW earlier this week. Having fallen to 217p, cheap buyers helped the shares claw back some of the earlier losses to finish 2 1/2 down at 221 1/2 p. Turnover was an above-average 4.4m. NatWest said: 'The return on capital and prospects for asset price inflation point to an overvalued property base. Depreciation of a large portion of the assets must now be on the agenda with ominous implications for the earnings profile.' Giving an example, the securities house said: 'An annual two per cent straight line write-off would mean that 1995's forecast profits become Pounds 76m rather than the current Pounds 125m.' However, Forte did the rounds in the city yesterday afternoon saying it had no plans to alter its depreciation policy. The company also questioned the figures arrived at in the note.</p>

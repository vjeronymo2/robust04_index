			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 23 KYODO -- Money rates remained  unchanged in Tokyo on Thursday [23 June] as the Bank of Japan  took an almost neutral monetary stance.    In interbank trading, the unsecured overnight call rate was  traded at 2 2/32 to 2 3/32 percent.    On the open market, the rate on newly issued three-month  certificates of deposit was offered around 2.11-2.13 percent.    Considering the yen's recent gain against the dollar, the  central bank's supply of funds was rather smaller than expected,  said a dealer at a Japanese commercial bank.    Some expect the central bank to continue its monetary stance  to stabilize longer-term interest rates for some time.    A dealer at a long-term credit bank said, "It will be a long  time before the Bank of Japan tries to lead interest rates lower  to check the yen's appreciation."    The bank of Japan injected 300 billion yen into the market  by  purchasing one-week discount bills worth 200 billion yen and by  lending 100 billion yen to commercial banks, against the  projected shortage of 320 billion yen for the day.    As of Wednesday, reserves by commercial banks in the central  bank coffers were 300 billion yen over the required amount.</p>

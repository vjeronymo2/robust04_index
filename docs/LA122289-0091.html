			<p><P> December 22, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES: LA CIENEGA AREA  </P> <P> Known as the Zhou Brothers, Shan Zuo and Da Huang Zhoushi are young emigres  from the People's Republic of China, members of the first generation of their  countrymen to work in abstract styles based on Western models. They collaborate  on large and lumbering mixed-media paintings -- some in columnar formats --  that look dutifully schooled in the art of Miro and Dubuffet as well as the  prehistoric cliff paintings of Guangxi Province. Silhouettes of "primitive"  figures and beasts, thin red lines and small markings meander over lumpy  surfaces of buckling fabric. The artists' attempt at creating a weathered,  "ancient" effect is thwarted by a cacophony of special effects, including  metallic paints and passages that seem to have been textured with metal  screening.  </P> <P> The smaller paintings are somewhat more streamlined, though they still get  zapped by ludicrously inappropriate swaths of metallic paint. A horned animal  and a harp-like form hanging from the central tree in "Tree of Life" have a  sprightly, piquant aspect. With more pruning of extraneous elements, the  fanciful side of the Zhou Brothers' vision might have some room to breathe.  (Feingarten Galleries, 8380 Melrose Ave., to Feb. 24.)

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Liliya Kuznetsova] </F>   [Text] Moscow March 10 TASS -- The flood of immigrants from  third-world countries is growing like a snowball. Their number  increases by something like one hundred people a day, announced  on Thursday an official in the Russian Federal Migration Service.    "Russia will accept only those who qualify as refugees",  Yuriy Arkhipov, the head of the department on external  migration, declared in an article with ITAR-TASS. "No one will  be able to get that status automatically".    Arkhipov holds the opinion that Russia has ended up with a  crisis situation in the immigrant sphere because the law adopted  on refugees and the act on Russia's accession to the United  Nations 1951 convention "on the status of refugees" were not  very well thought out. At the same time, he noted, "the Western  countries quickly evaluated the situation and, as soon as Russia  signed the convention, made their entry laws much stricter".    At that time, a regional office representing the Department  of the UN High Commissioner for Refugee Affairs was formed in  Russia, with the goal of solving the problems of immigrants who  were already in the Russian Federation. Therefore, Arkhipov  said, "Russia, without being aware of it, became the country  which received the whole flood of migrants from the countries of  Asia, Africa, and the Middle East".    In order to solve the problems created by immigrants from  developing countries, it is necessary to, first of all,  "regulate the situation on the border through legislation and  international agreements", said the migration official. That  does not mean, he cautioned, that we "should erect an iron  curtain, but we cannot put up with the transparency of the  Russian borders any longer".    Arkhipov expressed his opinion that every country in the  Commonwealth of Independent States should take the  responsibility for the security of its borders upon itself.  Otherwise, "trying to limit the flow of immigrants is like  bailing water with a sieve".    Besides, Arkhipov said, Russia should let the world  community  know through the mass media that it "is not considering  establishing any aid programmes for massive waves of immigrants  from third-world countries".    Explaining the way the immigrants operate, the official said  the majority of them do not immediately apply for refugee status  as soon as they cross the border, as they should under the law,  but try to get to Moscow. "The country's capital is not a  reception point". The migration services, even after they grant  refugee status to somebody, "do not then settle the immigrant in  the Moscow region". Moscow already holds about 180 thousand  immigrants, who have created a whole mass of problems. "They do  not respect Russian citizens, ignore the laws of the country  sheltering them, and do not obey law enforcement  representatives", he claimed.    Arkhipov said the situation can be changed only by "the  creation of a clear mechanism for determining the legal status  of foreign citizens on Russian territory as a basis for adopting  the following appropriate decisions".</p>

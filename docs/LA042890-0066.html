			<p><P> April 28, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GNP GROWS; INFLATION UP TO 6.5%;  </P> <P> ECONOMY: AN EXPANSION IN BUSINESS INVESTMENT IS SIGNALED. BUT CONCERNS ARE  EXPRESSED OVER THE REPORT SHOWING INCREASE IN PRICE LEVELS.  </P> <P> The nation's economy rebounded to an annual growth rate of 2.1% in the first  quarter after nearly stalling out late last year, but a key measure of  inflation surged to a disturbingly high annual rate of 6.5%, the Commerce  Department reported Friday.  </P> <P> Economists said the factors influencing the recovery in economic growth --  continued trade improvement, a reduction in unsold inventories and expanded  business investment -- point to more expansion in the months ahead rather than  the recession that some had feared.  </P> <P> But they are concerned that the unexpectedly large increase in inflation, as  measured by an index tied to the gross national product, could prompt the  Federal Reserve Board to step on the brakes by maintaining or perhaps even  raising interest rates.  </P> <P> Economist Allen Sinai of the Boston Co. said that "the message is of solid  growth in an economy that is poised to keep growing," tempered by "negative and  worrisome" price increases that could force the Fed to dampen future growth.  </P> <P> Inflation, he said, "was entrenched and widespread . . . and that has to be  alarming from a policy-making point of view. For the Fed, the growth number is  acceptable, but the inflation number must be unacceptable. The question is, how  much slower must growth be for inflation to slow?"  </P> <P> "The inflation number," added Robert G. Dederick, chief economist of the  Northern Trust Co. in Chicago, "was absolutely ugly."  </P> <P> The resumed expansion of the gross national product was well above expectations  of only a few weeks ago, when most economists were predicting a sluggish  first-quarter GNP report similar to the 1.1% annual growth recorded during the  last three months of 1989.  </P> <P> Several components of the first-quarter gain were seen as portents of future  economic growth. Business inventories dropped at a yearly rate of $20.5  billion, while business investment gained $9.4 billion, or 7.6%. Both measures  reversed course from late 1989, when inventories grew and investment declined.  </P> <P> In addition, the nation's trade balance improved, and sales of U.S. goods and  services expanded both at home and abroad, the Commerce Department reported.  </P> <P> But the upbeat indicators were overshadowed by rising prices.  </P> <P> The 6.5% annual growth rate in the GNP price index, which measures actual price  changes for all goods and services that make up the gross national product, was  the highest quarterly reading since late 1981. It compares to an inflation rate  of 4.5% for all of 1989.  </P> <P> Commerce Department statisticians said that about half of the inflationary  acceleration was attributable to temporary energy and food price increases  caused by December's record cold weather. But even excluding the effect of  weather and a federal pay raise that went into effect in January, prices still  rose at an annual rate of 5.2% during the quarter.  </P> <P> J. Antonio Villamil, the Commerce Department's chief economist, acknowledged  that the inflation report was "disappointing news." But he said he expects  inflationary pressures to moderate later in the year.  </P> <P> The report revived concerns that the Fed would be forced to tighten its grip on  the nation's credit supply at a time when long-term interest rates already have  risen above 9% for the first time in a year.  </P> <P> Higher interest rates slow the economy by discouraging businesses and consumers  from borrowing money to finance purchases and investments. Interest-sensitive  industries such as housing and automobiles can be particularly hard hit.  </P> <P> "We have set ourselves up for a halfway decent first half of 1990," said Donald  Straszheim, chief economist for Merrill Lynch Capital Markets in New York. "But  by the end of the year, the economy will be slowing."  </P> <P> The financial markets were jarred by the inflation report and its potential  impact on interest rates. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 31.53 points  Friday to close at 2,645.05.  </P> <P> Analyst Giulio Martini at Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co. in New York said the  Fed will have little choice but to tighten soon because both the economy and  inflation are likely to keep rising.  </P> <P> "That's the reality the Fed has to contend with: a rate of inflation that's  higher than the Fed can tolerate," Martini said. "I believe the Fed will be  waiting to see if the strength we see in the economy here will be ratified  later on. If so, the Fed will be forced to act. We already know that 2% growth  isn't slow enough to bring inflation down."  </P> <P> In a separate report, Commerce Department statisticians said that corporate  profits fell by a revised amount of $9.3 billion in the fourth quarter of 1989,  a slight improvement from the $9.5 billion decline reported a month ago.  Profits fell $12.6 billion in the third quarter last year.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Hannes Reichmann report: "`Adolfovich's' Helpers"] </F>   [Text] The 15-square-meter office at 4  Hammer-Purgstall-Gasse in Vienna's Second District is dominated  by a collection of antique samovars from Macedonia and a whole  battalion of selected French brandies.    The approximately 60-year-old host gingerly picked up a  plastic covered sheet of paper that has made the owner very  happy in the past week. The document carries the headline  "Authorization." The authorized German translation beneath  reads: "I herewith confirm that Mr. Svetoslav Stoilov is my  first adviser on economic and entrepreneurial issues." The  document, dated 28 December 1993, carries the scrawly signature  "Vladimir Zhirinovskiy."    If one of the two gentlemen had not caused considerable stir  throughout Europe in the past two weeks with his strange ideas,  one might simply dismiss the verbal outcome of this friendship  between Stoilov and Zhirinovskiy as the mere twaddle of two odd  birds. Yet the Bulgarian-born Svetoslav Stoilov, who has been  living in Vienna with an Austrian passport for 30 years and  whose gold-colored calling card identifies him as a  "consultant," has unconditionally offered his services to a man  who is probably the most dangerous politician on the continent  -- Vladimir "Adolfovich" Zhirinovskiy, who as head of the  right-wing extremist "Liberal Democratic Party of Russia" (LDP),  was the surprise winner of the Russian parliamentary elections  and who will in the future lead the second strongest group of 70  parliamentarians after Yeltsin's reformers. He arrived on a  spectacular "private visit" to Austria on 22 December.  <H5>  The Program </H5>   During his four-day visit, Zhirinovskiy skillfully dealt all  sides radical nationalist verbal blows. The program of his  visit and the real purpose was determined exactly before he  arrived. His trip was based on solid entrepreneurial motives.  When the trained lawyer arrived on the evening of 22 December  in a Lauda Air plane from Munich (where he met with head of the  right-wing extremist "German People's Union," Gerhard Frey) at  Vienna's Schwechat Airport, the "Antiterrorism Task Force," the  elite Interior Ministry troop, was alerted. Half a dozen  officials did not leave the Russian's side from then on.    After landing in Klagenfurt, the police officers saw a  bizarre succession of events in the days that followed. While  the journalists, who had arrived from all over Europe,  concentrated on Zhirinovskiy and his Carinthian host, timber  merchant Edwin Neuwirth from Reichenfels, the advisers of the  Russian politician arranged numerous business meetings. Large  limousines with all kinds of license plates arrived at the  "Rainsberg" hotel. "We received businessmen from Austria,  Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, Italy, Slovenia, and Croatia  here," the 67-year-old Edwin Neuwirth boasted.    Neuwirth, an ethnic German from Transylvania, who  volunteered  for the Waffen-SS when he was 16 and who has been living in the  Lavanttal Valley since 1953, attracted the reporters' attention  with solid Nazi slogans. "I do not know of any gas chambers in  Germany," he stated in an interview with Austrian radio. As a  result, the public prosecutor in Klagenfurt initiated  investigations because of the suspicion of the violation of the  law banning Nazi activities. "I just think in national terms.  Zhirinovskiy is as national and liberal as Joerg Haider,"  Neuwirth complained.    In the meantime, the "advisers" of Neuwirth's visitor  Zhirinovskiy devoted themselves intensively to the businessmen  who had arrived. A police official, who was disguised as a  skier wearing a black bobble hat, took numerous pictures. The  state police and officials from the German Federal Intelligence  Service (BND), who arrived especially because of the  Zhirinovskiy visit, are now hectically evaluating these pictures.  <H5>  Ivanovic's Oweka </H5>   One of the entrepreneurs was Petar Ivanovic. The 57-year-old  businessman from Serbia has been living in Austria since 1968  and is carrying on trade with the East as the manager of the  Oweka trading company, located at 31 Praterstrasse in Vienna.  He primarily sells petrochemical products. In his best year --  in 1990 -- the turnover of the company involved 700 million  schillings. An "Oweca Petrol AG" in the small town of Glarus in  the Swiss canton of the same name is registered as the parent  company of the Vienna Oweka firm in the trade register.  Strangely enough, there is neither a postal address nor a  telephone number for this company in Glarus.    It is still unknown what Ivanovic and his aides Mirko Milic  and Goran Miletic discussed specifically with Zhirinovskiy's  clan in Carinthia. Nobody in Ivanovic's office answered the  phone up to the editorial deadline. However, there are signs  suggesting that Ivanovic has financial problems, and that he is  urgently looking for new business partners. In reply to a  credit inquiry, the "Credit Protection Association of 1870"  wrote: "The enterprise has a poor credit standing." The  forwarding agency Technokontrol, another of Ivanovic's  enterprises, filed a petition for bankruptcy as recently as in  December. A third company is not exactly thriving, either: The  Indiptrading Handels GmbB company, which Ivanovic operates in  Montenegro with partners from Titograd and whose deals are  violating the UN sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro.    An investigator believes Ivanovic came to Carinthia for the  following reasons: "There are hints that one of Zhirinovskiy's  financial advisers is establishing cover companies in Western  Europe and is looking for partners so he can fully participate  in oil trade." The name of this man is Alexej Wedenkin, and he  procures cash for the extremist from Moscow. "Mr. Wedenkin has  established 10 enterprises in Germany, Italy, the Netherlands,  and Switzerland," Zhirinovskiy's host Neuwirth pointed out.    Wedenkin boasted: "We have millions of dollars." A certain  Dimitriy Klinkov is also commuting between Klagenfurt and  Moscow. Klinkov, 23, uses the title of "trade director" of the  IBC GmbH company. The IBC registered in Klagenfurt belongs to  Josef Hambrusch and is carrying out trade with the East. Asked  about his links with Zhirinovskiy, Hambrusch replied: "No  comment. We do not want to see our names in the newspapers."    The Klagenfurt businessman confirmed, however, that he knew  two other visitors who had come to Carinthia: Werner Girke and  Werner Neumann from Berlin. The two men are responsible for  discreet trust transactions about which they did not want to  talk. Their Berlin Fiduciary Management and Organization GmbH  company (TVO) is considered a center of Zhirinovskiy's West  German investments. "Chief Executive" Girke only stated: "We  deal with property management. But we do not grant any  interviews."    Zhirinovskiy's most interesting interlocutor had to make the  longest journey: The Russian Anton Nenakov, 26, from Amsterdam,  where he is the head of the Global Money Management Trust  enterprise. At present, he is allegedly trying to obtain a  permit to establish an investment bank, and he provided funds  for Zhirinovskiy's election campaign in December.    From Belgium, a man arrived in Carinthia whose name is, in  all likelihood, Luc L. (the full name is known to the editors).  He is 65, and has for decades been operating a successful  enterprise in Antwerp that sells all kinds of weapons. L's  specialty is supplying rebel organizations in Black Africa with  military equipment. Zhirinovskiy is pleading for massive  investments in the ailing Russian defense industry. After all,  envoys of Fikret Abdic, the Muslim feudal entrepreneur and head  of the Agrokomerz concern which was involved in a scandal in  Bihac in western Bosnia, wanted to persuade Zhirinovskiy to pay  a short visit to his country. Zhirinovskiy, however, refused  because of the concerns of his security advisers.  <H5>  Stoilov's Show </H5>   When the Russian and his entourage left Vienna on 25  December  aboard a Balkan Air aircraft for Sofia, the show of  Zhirinovskiy's Vienna adviser Svetoslav Stoilov began.  Zhirinovskiy took up the invitation of the Bulgarian living in  Austria who was born in the Bulgarian part of Macedonia. They  visited Stoilov's home town of Sandanski. "We went to  Thessaloniki in Greece without a visa, and Vladimir swam in the  Aegean Sea," Stoilov stated enthusiastically. Bent over the book  "Alexander the Great and his Time," the ardent advocate of a  Macedonian nation stressed: "Zhirinovskiy said I would be the  better Bulgarian president. I told him: `Vladimir, you cannot  simply give me all that.'"    The eclat was perfect. President Zhelev ordered the  expulsion of the Russian because he babbled about "Thrace's  reunification." The long-planned visit to Berlin did not come  about either. This time, the Berlin enterprise TVO and Messrs.  Girke and Neumann were supposed to act as hosts. They had  invited Zhirinovskiy. Yet the government in Bonn denied him a  visa. As a result, Zhirinovskiy railed against Germany after  this return to Moscow and threatened, among other things, to  start a "third world war."    "I will take care of things in the future," Svetoslav  Stoilov  stated at his Vienna office, trying to calm things down. "I  will write most of his speeches, and I will exert a moderating  influence. We are talking on the telephone every day."  Consultant Stoilov, who claims to have initiated a number of  prestigious projects for renowned Austrian companies trading  with the East, referring to the career opportunities of Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy, "whom I met accidentally at the Bolshoi Theater in  Moscow five years ago," stated: "In four or five months at the  latest, he will have ousted Yeltsin and will be president. And  I will advocate an independent state for all Macedonians from  Greece, Yugoslavia, and Bulgaria. A roundtable should decide as  soon as possible on the return to Germany of the territories  occupied by Poland."    Once he had warmed up, the fanatic Stoilov explained with a  flaming red face how his adopted country Austria should profit  from his activities as an adviser: "South Tirol must be  returned to Austria as soon as possible."</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Straight Talk" program hosted by Osvaldo Rodriguez of </F> JUVENTUD REBELDE and featuring guest Maribel Acosta from NTV --  live]    [Text] [Rodriguez] Is Cuba a country of prostitutes?  [jineteras] Maribel, you are astonished by the question. I can  see that in your face. I believe many people are asking this  question today, a question we should try to answer today,  perhaps talking about the matter, talking about prostitution,  male prostitution as well....    [Acosta, interrupting] And child prostitution.    [Rodriguez] And child prostitution. I believe we must face  this matter with a great deal of realism. This is a phenomenom  new to the Revolution, but old to the world. Actually it was an  old phenomenom in Cuba before the Revolution.    Prostitution was a necessity, a necessity in order to  survive. Later it became a way of being able to live better than  the rest, in that recent period. Today, I believe the economic  situation is fostering a revival of this phenomenon, but I still  believe one should not have to sell one's body in order to solve  problems in a crisis situation. I do not know what you, yourself  think about this.    [Acosta] I think prostitution is obviously on the increase,  and I mean all types of prostitution -- whether of women, which  is is what basically attracts the most attention and, to put it  one way, is the most developed, but also of children, and of men  as well. It is something that one did not encounter frequently,  a few years ago.    What is most dangerous, however, is that it is beginning to  receive a certain amount of social tolerance, at least in the  city of Havana. I know this because I travel extensively  throughout the country. Situations like this also exist in other  parts of Cuba, although I think it is more open, more obvious  and overwhelming in Havana.    This situation is also tolerated by a particular group of  people in Havana. It is obvious that the economic situation in  Cuba is difficult, that is clear. But as far as I am concerned  -- I, who am living more or less the same way everyone else  lives -- it is not necessary to sell oneself at all. There is a  very curious phenomenom. For example, [pauses] of course there  are many ways of looking at things in life, and the very way  society sometimes looks at things contributes to different  things.    The other day I was walking by the Hotel Presidente on my  way  to the Casa de Las Americas, and on the hotel door leading to  the pool there was a sign reading: children's party -- cake,  soft drinks, pinatas and sweets during the last two Sundays of  the month: two dollars per child. That is what the sign said.  Well, we all know that having dollars is no longer penalized,  but we also know that pharmacies that were selling medicines in  dollars were deprived of those medicines for this very same  reason because these are things with which the people must not  be burdened.    [Rodriguez] We have said -- in the past, in Straight Talk --  that there were limits, to dollar income. But we cannot hurt the  population's feelings; and that sign you just mentioned surely  hurts and exasperates those who walk by knowing that their  children would like to be there but cannot because their parents  do not have the dollars to pay for them.    [Acosta] Does the Presidente Hotel need to be profitable at  the expense of children's parties? I do not think so. I do not  think it needs to do that, and it should not do it either, not  only from the ethical point of view but also from the economic  point of view because by no means should it base its  profitability on something like this. And besides, you are  walking with your child, a child who does not understand things  much because he is still small, and he says: I would like to go  to the swimming pool on Sunday. And you say: You cannot go there  because we have to pay in dollars to get there. Imagine! And who  has dollars?    [Rodriguez] Maribel, I perceived indignation in you as you  gave that concrete example. I do think this is not the only  example, however. I think we must also talk about the family. A  few hours ago, I was told an anecdote concerning a neighborhood  here in Havana -- specifically, the Vedado neighborhood -- where  a 14-year-old girl engages in prostitution with her family's  permission. She is only 14 years old. I think that is the child  prostitution matter you mentioned. She is not a full grown woman  yet, and does not know what she wants. She has no idea of what  love really is, nor does she know the significance of selling  her body.    In addition to society as a whole, I think the family is  also  responsible, for allowing this to happen. And of course, the  government can be held partially, although not fully,  responsible for this because people often want the government to  solve all police problems through repression. I think this is  just a matter of education. What do you think?    [Acosta] Look, of course the family has a tremendous  influence in this regard. And this has to do with what I was  telling you about the social tolerance of this phenomenon.  Tolerance means that people are looking at the phenomenon more  leniently, not worrying much about whether a young girl or boy  becomes a prostitute or not. This, then, becomes a growing  phenomenon, and of course the family is very much responsible.  There are people who claim -- and on this I agree with them --  that such behavior is normal in a time of crisis. I mean: A  human being's worst aspects usually emerge in times of crisis.  This is true. Therefore, we are facing a phenomenon for which  there is no explanation. It is good to be alert, however,  because we want to preserve the virtues we have preserved to  date.    And there is something that continues to bother me: Every  morming I walk around the Habana Libre Hotel, and there are many  children begging there, including children wearing uniforms,  asking the tourists for money. The way they ask tourists for  money, however, is not the way we see children in capitalist  countries or poor countries ask.    In a capitalist country when a child asks a tourist for  money, the tourists do not dare to do anything because they know  that if they try anything, they can be beaten or can be simply  murdered. Our children, accustomed to being loved by society,  children who are usually protected and often spoiled, do not  know anything about what happens in other countries. And I have  seen the way tourists are attacked and beaten up in other places.    Such an example gives you an idea of the wicked actions that  can occur, and I have often thought about this. Do you realize  the difference here, and do you realize the real need to do  these things? I mean: Do you see the difference between one  place and another?    The children who are begging for things in certain foreign  countries, as I have seen them in Latin America, are sad-looking  children. They are children who are fighting for survival, and  you can see that in their eyes. But our children beg for money  to buy candies.    [Rodriguez] Maribel, I believe the examples you are giving  us  regarding the children seem to be sporadic examples that can  perhaps be seen around the Habana Libre Hotel, as you said, or  maybe in other tourist centers in the interior of Cuba; and they  are being repressed effectively by the Pioneer organizations,  the Union of Young Communists [UJC], and educational  organizations, and I think families are also taking action. As  you said, however, the goals of those children are candies, but  sometimes they could also be attracted by signs like the one you  found on the door of a hotel. Parents often also need those  dollars, which cannot be obtained easily through legal means.  They need dollars to take their children to such places, and to  meet certain artificial needs that are often created.    [Acosta] Yes. This is something we can discuss further, to  tie what is happening in our society to the effects of the  measures adopted recently. Moreover, the discussions held among  the population, those Parliaments in the Workplace, seek to  explain these phenomena, which are beginning to undermine  society's values because work and the salaries of people who  depend on their work, who depend on their salaries and their  competency, are valued in society and are what give people their  true value.    The measures adopted recently, or measures outlined as  policies that will be implemented gradually, will surely create  the conditions in which people will be admired and respected  for, and their value will depend on, their personal efforts and  work, and not on immorality. This phenomenon, then, has to do  with all these things, and in a way we must try to harness it  socially; otherwise, social tolerance will emerge and the  problem will worsen.    [Rodriguez] I also think that we must...    [Acosta, interrupting] We must also recall that this year,  the crime committee discussed the idea of including within the  penal code some criminal actions such as prostitution,  procuring, etc. It was an idealistic mistake to exclude them,  that is, I think that things like these must also be repressed.    [Rodriguez] Yes. I also think, Maribel, that this type of  action has reached a peak due mainly to the economic crisis. But  there are other moral values that must be preserved. In addition  to solving its economic problems, society must also preserve  moral values because, as you said, these economic problems are  related to our moral and social problems. But above all, I think  we must recover the precept we have learned from our  forefathers, from our grandparents. They are poor but honest. I  think we must recover these principles because no crisis...    [Acosta, interrupting] These are also the principles of Jose  Marti. When we read Marti's ideas thoroughly, we realize that  one of the most common words in his writings is honesty.    [Rodriguez] Yes. No crisis can drag us to find dollars  through any illegal means. It is true that in our society having  dollars today means having solved some essential problems which  most Cubans cannot solve. This is a truth no one can deny. But  obtaining dollars by means of selling one's body is perhaps one  of the most despicable ways for a human being to obtain a  profit. And you who are a woman will probably know how to  explain better to our listeners what does it mean for a woman to  feel love for another person, to have a feeling, and not to be  sold like merchandise because I think all those women engaged in  prostitution are just merchandise. Don't you think?    [Acosta] Yes. But I think you are only revealing your  chauvinist position because I have to explain the situation not  only because I am a woman, but I am going to answer the question  anyhow because I guess I have no other alternative. Then, yes.  Of course, love is essential in all aspects of life to enjoy  life. This is our ultimate goal in life. As (Galiano) used to  say: It is much better to make a living and not to buy it ready  made. Then this is what it is, we have to gradually make our  life, fighting and loving. And this type of action will  ultimately generate love. No one can say that the lack of love  is necessary for living. I believe these social behaviors can  somehow be controlled or eradicated. I want Cuba to stop this  problem. This is further proof that Cuba will remain as the Cuba  we have always wanted and which we have hoped for.    [Rodriguez] Thank you very much, Maribel Acosta, from the  National Television Newscast, for discussing the problem of  prostitution with us.</p>

			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / International Company News: Toshiba venture with Ericsson ERICSSON of Sweden yesterday announced a link-up with Toshiba to install and service equipment for Japanese digital mobile telephone networks, in a joint venture which they said could lead to further areas of co-operation. The unit, Ericsson Toshiba Telecommunication Systems, will be 60 per cent owned by the Swedish company. It expects sales of Y32bn (Dollars 251.9m) in 1994, the year its prime customer, Digital Phone Group, is due to begin its service. Ericsson, which claims 40 per cent of the world market in cellular mobile telephone systems, was already under contract to Digital Phone to supply base stations and exchange systems to its first two operating areas in Tokyo and Osaka. Digital Phone, which has backers including the national Japan Railways, plans a countrywide service by the year 2000. By then, Toshiba expects some 10m sets to be in use in the recently deregulated sector with Digital Phone competing against Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, the semi-privatised domestic telecoms utility, and three or four others, not all of which would have a nationwide network. Digital Phone is to begin by serving Tokyo, Osaka and the Tokai area of central Japan. Manufacture of the systems, which will incorporate Toshiba parts, will stay in Sweden and outside the venture, although at a press conference in Tokyo yesterday the companies said this could be reviewed later. Toshiba's production of cellular handsets is excluded from the deal. Mr Shiro Matsuo, a Toshiba senior vice-president, said it would 'like to take this as the basis for exploring further possibilities together'. Mr Gunnar Eriksson, head of Ericsson's radio systems side, said it did 'not want to limit co-operation' to the one project. Both sides described Toshiba's 40 per cent minority stake in the venture as an 'appropriate' level.</p>

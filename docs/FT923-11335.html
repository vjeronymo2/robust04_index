			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Clock stopped over Kalon bid THE CLOCK on Kalon's hostile Pounds 89.5m bid for Manders (Holdings) has temporarily been stopped. The Takeover Panel yesterday issued a statement saying that the decision whether or not the paint maker's 8-for-3 share offer for the paint, ink and property company would be referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission had yet to be made, and that it was unlikely that the outcome would be announced by Wednesday July 29, day 39 of the progress of the bid. The panel has therefore ruled that day 39 will now be deemed the second day after the announcement of the decision. Kalon has argued that a successful takeover would only boost its market share from 16 to 23 per cent of the whole decorative paints market, while Manders has contended that the merged group would command some 75 per cent of the own-label paints market. The bid has attracted attention beyond strict financial and competition limits - a Commons motion has been signed by 64 MPs urging that the bid be referred on the grounds that both bidder and target are healthy, profitable companies and that there will be inevitable social damage in terms of job losses. The Office of Fair Trading, which recommends referral or non-referral to the trade and industry secretary, said yesterday that it was looking at the whole paints market, including the own-label sector, and that it was sounding opinions from interested third parties. Mr Roger Akers, Manders chief executive, said: 'It implies that it is not an obvious not-a-referral situation. We must see that as good news.' Mr Mike Hennessy, Kalon group managing director, said he was not surprised by the delay. 'The bid has created considerable interest and it's taking time to evaluate all the issues.'</p>

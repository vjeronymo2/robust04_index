			<p>920629 FT  29 JUN 92 / Mitterrand in Sarajevo: Croats 'undermining UN' CROATIA is undermining efforts by United Nations peace-keeping forces in that republic, and is destabilising chances of any ceasefire in Bosnia-Hercegovina, UN secretary-general Boutros Boutros Ghali told the security council in a report published in New York at the weekend. In the most damning criticism yet of Croatia's activities in both Croatia and Bosnia-Hercegovina, Mr Boutros Ghali appealed to Croatian President Franjo Tudjman to withdraw Croatian forces from Bosnia and refrain from attacking UN-protected areas in Croatia. 'Tudjman gave us no assurance whatsoever that he would meet our requests,' an EC official in Belgrade said this weekend. 'We warned Tudjman that Boutros Ghali was becoming increasingly impatient with Croatia's obstructive and dangerous activities,' a UN official in Belgrade said yesterday. In a memorandum to Mr Boutros Ghali by the UN officials who drew up the report - not yet a public document - he was told that Zagreb was using the international focus on Sarajevo as a smokescreen to pursue its own aims in Croatia and Bosnia-Hercegovina, that Croats were increasingly confident because they were now heavily armed, and that they sensed that the Yugoslav army and Serb irregulars were overstretching themselves. Croatia's aims include regaining all its territory seized by Serbs last year. But those regions are now under UN protection. Western diplomats said the Croatian government believed the presence of the UN was allowing the Serbs to hold on to the areas. 'In fact, the UN is trying to prevent Serbs and Croats from killing each other. That is one of the reasons why we are here,' a UN official said. In his report on Croatia, Mr Boutros Ghali said the Zagreb government was hindering the UN's work in several ways. The memorandum refers to a case in sector west, a UN protected region in central Croatia, where a bomb exploded in the house rented by UN officials on June 5. A local Serb, despite threats by the Croatian army, had rented the house to Canadian UN officials. 'The Croats do not want us there (UN-protected region in central Croatia) because they, like the Serbs in eastern Croatia, are involved in their own form of ethnic cleansing. They want to expel the local Serbs and regain control over the region. They do not want to let us see what is going on,' a UN official said. Of more concern for UN activities in the region, and reflected in Mr Boutros Ghali's report, the Croatian army last week launched an offensive in the Serb-inhabited region of Krajina, south-west Croatia - also a UN protectorate. 'The Croatian army attacked these areas last Sunday, and bombarded Knin (the capital of Krajina) last Monday,' said Mr Cedric Thornberry, head of the UN's civilian operations. The Serbs have since declared a state of mobilisation against the Croatian offensive. 'The UN forces are now right in the middle of the firing line. They can hardly defend themselves,' said a UN official. In Hercegovina, western Bosnia, UN officials have repeatedly asked local Croatian forces to allow them to visit the region: 'We were told by the Croats that they could not guarantee our safety,' an official said. He said Croatian forces had destroyed dozens of Serb - and Moslem - villages in the region and forced thousands of civilians to flee. During a meeting of the charges d'affaires of the five permanent members of the security council last week in Belgrade, a diplomat suggested that the west should consider sanctions on Croatia if it refused to withdraw its forces from Bosnia and stop hindering UN operations in Croatia. 'No one questions that Serbia is the aggressor. But like Serbia, Croatia is also creating its own Greater Croatia,' a UN official said.</p>

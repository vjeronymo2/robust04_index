			<p>BFN     [Text] Mmabatho public servants have decided on an  indefinite go-slow strike. The decision was taken in defiance  of a call by the North-West premier, Mr. Popo Molefe, for them  to act in a professional manner. The approximately 500 civil  servants also expressed their anger at Mr. Molefe for slamming  their demands for salary parity with white officials. A senior  official said that before the elections Mr. Molefe had termed  the demand as their right, now he referred to it as stupid.</p>

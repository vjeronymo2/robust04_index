			<p><P> August 5, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> BERNSON DESERVES CRITICISM  </P> <P> It is not surprising that people's trust in local politics is waning when faced  with conduct like Councilman Hal Bernson's.  </P> <P> His response to overwhelming opposition to his own pet project, Porter Ranch,  has ranged from disinterest to implied threats. His most recent remarks are  truly outrageous. In his reaction to news that the city of Simi Valley is  pursuing legal action against the Porter Ranch plan, Bernson says citizens  "hoodwinked" and "duped" a government.  </P> <P> There is no don for the Valley. Bernson acts like he wants to make offers that  people can't refuse. Let's get a grip and proceed in a democratic, responsible  way.  </P> <P> ROGER STRULL  </P> <P> Granada Hills  </P></p>

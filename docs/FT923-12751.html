			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / Reliable Scot resists hammer horror tactics A deceptively simple choice will lie before Mr John Smith when he becomes leader of the Labour party by acclamation tomorrow afternoon. Will he oppose the government, or will he support it? Silly question, you might say. The task of the leader of the opposition is to oppose. Yes, but there is opposition and opposition. There is skirmishing on the periphery of what the administration is doing and there is an att-empt to bring the entire ed-ifice crashing down in a single act of wild and glorious destructiveness. The temptation to have a go is strongly felt in some sections of the Labour party. If he were to succumb Mr Smith would need to pick up only one weapon, a sledgehammer labelled 'leave the exchange rate mechanism'. With that fearsome object held high above his head he might stand a chance of transforming himself from a plain Edinburgh brief into the Arnold Schwarzenegger of British politics. 'Withdraw]', he could snarl. 'Devalue - and end the recession.' In one or two swift but irresponsible phrases he could thus attack the foundations of the government's strategy for the management of the British polity over the next five to 10 years. A tacit alliance between the anti-Europeans on the Conservative back-benches and the principal opposition party might be unholy, but it would certainly frighten Mr John Major. The prime minister can relax. It would be contrary to what is known of Mr Smith's character for him to do any such thing. Before the election, when he was shadow chancellor, he was wont to remark that his determination not to devalue if Labour came to power was for him a matter of honour. His commitment to the principal proposition put forward by Mr Major - that Britain should be at the heart of European affairs - is absolute. The prime minister and the chancellor have pledged the most valuable assets they possess, their reputations, to the maintenance of Britain's position within the ERM at existing parities. This undertaking is closely bound up with their public support of the Maastricht agreement. It is a government package deal. If Mr Smith remains true to himself, it will enjoy the broad support of the opposition There is, however, a disputed ingredient. The prime minister appears to be willing to sit out a recession for as long as it takes to approach zero inflation. Mr Norman Lamont warned Conservatives of this on Wednesday. Take his warning seriously. He did not waver from his anti-inflationary hawkishness last year, when the election lay in the future. There is no reason to believe that he will be budged now, when the electorate need not be troubled for another four or five years. The implications of this are beginning to be understood as people awaken from the shock of discovering that the post-election stock exchange bubble has burst. Bottom lines continue to sink. Businesses continue to go bankrupt. Jobs remain difficult to get. Although the rate of increase in unemployment slowed last month, the total is still rising. Mr Major and Mr Lamont sit, arms folded, watching inflation fall. Mr Smith can hardly be seen to be conniving in a policy that says nothing about bringing unemployment down in double-quick time. No Labour leader could do that. He has therefore prepared an escape hatch. This is to argue, as he did when addressing Labour members of the European parliament in Strasbourg last month, that the ERM is 'a fixed, but adjustable, system' which does not preclude 'the possibility of a general realignment'. He appeared to favour an EC-led German revaluation, as does Mr Neil Kinnock, on the grounds that Bonn's reunification costs should not fall as a monetary surcharge on the rest of Europe. The payoff for a higher D-Mark, he believes, could be a general reduction in interest rates, and a reversal of the present deflationary bias of the ERM. The new Labour leader is aware that France is implacably opposed to this line, but he can reasonably hope that Paris will be more amenable after the Maastricht referendum in September. He may then float the notion that general realignment (ie a German revaluation) can be sold to the French as a part of the post-Maastricht convergence process and therefore as a step on the way to economic and monetary union. If the pieces fall into place he will be in a position to attack the government fairly vociferously in the autumn. Mr Lamont has already made a pre-emptive strike. Last Friday he said of a German realignment: 'No country in the ERM is looking in that direction. The issue is simply not on the agenda.' The reason was pure Lamont: 'The shock we are facing is not that of German reunification - it is the shock of trying to get an inflation rate comparable to that of Germany. Our other European partners recognise this.' I will not attempt to choose between Mr Lamont's economics and Mr Smith's. Economists in general are gradually being unmasked as doctors were before them: their reputations are built on what they get right, but they really know very little about what determines many of the key variables upon which they are so quick to pronounce. In political terms, there is the world of difference between supporting membership of the ERM while calling for a realignment and demanding a unilateral British devaluation within the ERM. The first is what a responsible, nay respectable, opposition leader would choose. It nicely bridges the gap between Labour's pro- and anti-Europeans, thus confirming Mr Smith's reputation as a man who can be relied upon to find the centre of gravity of his party and place himself there. The second might smash the government, but it would risk Mr Smith's reputation as the essence of reliability and leave Labour open to the charge that it had changed its mind again. None of this tells us anything about Labour's long-term prospects, which will doubtless be extensively analysed after tomorrow's leadership election ceremonies are over. The truth is that nobody can say where British politics will stand in 1996 or 1997. Mr Smith may succeed in seducing Mr Paddy Ashdown's Liberal Democrats over to Labour, or the two parties may conclude a pact, or they may continue to battle against one another and thus deny both of them the fruits of office. Or Mr Major and Mr Lamont may fail, and fall. Who can tell? With Mr Major's government still increasing in popularity, the matter seems of little moment. What does matter is that a credible Labour opposition will confront the government when parliament returns from its lengthy summer break in mid-October. It could launch a strong verbal onslaught on the Conservatives, whose majority is only 21. Mr Smith may not be ruthless or reckless enough to attempt to frustrate the government, but he should be able to get a few laughs in the Commons and perhaps influence public opinion. Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition will be back in business.</p>

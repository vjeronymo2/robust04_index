			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Increased funds to aid energy efficiency INCREASED funding for energy efficiency schemes is among the government's latest plans for meeting international targets on global warming. The government said that it would reinforce the newly created Energy Saving Trust, set up to help households identify energy-saving measures. It also planned to take energy use by central government to below 80 per cent of 1990 levels by the year 2000, and to curb transport emissions further. Britain committed itself at last year's Rio Earth Summit to bringing carbon dioxide emissions back to 1990 levels in the year 2000, a cut of 6 per cent on projected levels. In the spring ministers said that present plans would achieve two-thirds of the target. Combined heat and power systems in blocks of flats and offices, which use the spare heat from electricity generation, are now expected to contribute 5,000MW of power by the year 2000, compared with the government's previous target of 4,000MW. Mr Simon Roberts, of the pressure group Friends of the Earth, said: 'The government now describes its CO2 programme as 'complete' but it has not specified how it will curb traffic growth, nor how it will reach the new higher targets for combined heat and power and for the Energy Saving Trust.'</p>

			<p><P> July 1, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ASSEMBLY REJECTS BILL PREVENTING CLEAR-CUTTING OF ANCIENT REDWOODS  </P> <P> Under heavy lobbying from the timber industry, the Assembly rejected  legislation Friday aimed at preventing the clear-cutting of ancient stands of  redwood trees in Northern California.  </P> <P> Backed by environmentalists, the bill was directed particularly at the Pacific  Lumber Co., which has greatly increased its harvest of redwood trees since it  was taken over by the Maxxam Group with the financial assistance of junk bond  wizard Michael Milken.  </P> <P> Assemblyman Byron Sher (D-Palo Alto), the author of the bill, conceded defeat  after he was able to garner only 33 of the 54 votes needed for passage. He  criticized representatives of the timber industry for spreading false charges  that the bill would wreak havoc on the state's economy.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Small Army of Lobbyists'  </P> <P> "Those misconceptions emanate from the small army of lobbyists and public  relations specialists hired by the Pacific Lumber Co. and the timber industry  to convince you that what is really a very modest bill will destroy the economy  of timber regions of the state and halt the construction of homes in  California," Sher told his colleagues.  </P> <P> Dennis Carpenter, a prominent lobbyist and former Republican state senator  hired by Pacific Lumber, said the bill would not have had serious consequences  for the company because it has already "promised" not to do any clear-cutting  of redwoods.  </P> <P> But he said that he and other timber industry representatives lobbied heavily  against the measure because its passage would have given environmentalists an  opportunity to start imposing restrictions on clear-cutting operations.  </P> <P> "The timber industry has long felt that if you take one tool away, what's the  next thing they come after?" Carpenter said. "He (Sher) has got a  preservationist mentality that is inconsistent with trying to harvest these  private lands the way they're zoned to be harvested."  </P> <P> Carpenter pointed out that enormous stands of redwoods already have been  preserved in public parks. "This is an emotional issue," he said. "It isn't a  timber issue."  </P> <P> Assemblyman Dan Hauser (D-Arcata), who represents much of the timber region,  asserted that the old-growth redwoods were in fact being destroyed by wind,  highway construction crews and tourists who visit the area.  </P> <P> "It's the impact of people in the parks that kill redwoods," Hauser told his  colleagues.  </P> <P> Hauser succeeded in sabotaging the bill Thursday by winning passage of several  hostile amendments. One would have required anyone who files suit against a  timber company's harvesting plan to post a bond to reimburse the company if the  challenge is unsuccessful.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Expenditure Amendment  </P> <P> A second amendment would have allocated $50,000 to conduct a study of the  effects of the bill. While seemingly innocuous, this provision boosted the  number of votes required from 41 to 54 because all expenditures require a  two-thirds vote of the 80-member Assembly.  </P> <P> But Sher pledged to return next year with another measure aimed at halting what  he believes is the over-harvesting of old-growth redwoods -- trees that are as  much as 1,000 to 1,500 years old.  </P> <P> The assemblyman said some estimates indicate that all the old-growth redwood  trees now in private hands will be cut within three to six years. "There won't  be anything left to preserve," he said.  </P></p>

			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / Technology: Ultraviolet light shines on poisons - Worth Watching Scientists at PA Consulting Group's Cambridge laboratory have developed a fast, simple and cheap way of detecting poisons in water. The method, called MUVS sensor, can tell in less than 15 seconds whether even a minute quantity of toxic contamination is present. The MUVS sensor works by shining ultraviolet light on micro-organisms such as yeast. When the yeast are healthy they block most of the light, but if they become ill because of exposure to a toxin, they become more transparent. All that is needed to measure whether water is contaminated is yeast, a strong ultraviolet lamp and a light meter. The sensor can detect a wide range of potentially poisonous materials including toxic metal residues and PCBs. 'The most immediate application of this sort of technology is in water monitoring,' said William Bains, who developed the sensor. PA Consulting: UK, 0763 261222.</p>

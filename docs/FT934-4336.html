			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / Nigeria accused over Dollars 64m payment: Ex-minister claims oil storage plan was unnecessary The state-owned Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation paid out Dollars 64m for an unnecessary oil storage facility it commissioned and subsequently cancelled, according to Chief Philip Asiodu, the country's former oil minister. The scheme was 'a scandal of major proportions', Chief Asiodu said in an interview in London, in which he quoted extensively from copies of minutes and documents exchanged with NNPC and other officials. In August a confidential government report expressed concern about 'leakages' in the accounts of NNPC. Nigeria exports about 1.3m barrels of oil a day. Chief Asiodu, a respected former permanent secretary in the oil ministry in the 1970s who became a leading Lagos-based businessman, was appointed oil minister at the beginning of January. He declined a further term in office in August, when the country's interim cabinet was reshuffled and military rule extended. In December 1992, shortly before Chief Asiodu took office, the government approved a proposal to hire oil tankers which would be anchored off Lagos and hold up to 1m tons of petroleum products as a strategic reserve. In a series of minutes to NNPC officials and to President Ibrahim Babangida, who stepped down as Nigeria's military leader in August, Mr Asiodu called for the cancellation of the scheme which, had it been followed through, would have cost nearly Dollars 300m. Chief Asiodu told NNPC officials that they had used 'bogus economics' and argued that even if the project were to go ahead, it need not cost more than Dollars 45m. But he strongly recommended its cancellation, pointing out that it would not resolve Nigeria's fuel shortages. These, he said, were caused by internal distribution problems rather than supply shortages. In a minute dated May 21 and sent to Gen Babangida, Mr Asiodu wrote: 'The matter raises. . . serious doubts about rationality, integrity and honesty in the conduct of NNPC management.' Mr Asiodu sent a further detailed criticism of the project to the president, who in a minute dated June 10 agreed that it should be cancelled. On July 30, a senior NNPC official said that, although the contract had been terminated on July 9, NNPC was contractually committed to payments totalling Dollars 64m to the charter company providing the tankers and handling the project. This included charter charges of Dollars 25m for the period December 23, 1992 to July 9, 1993, 'damages' amounting to Dollars 33m and further obligations of Dollars 6m. On August 9, Chief Asiodu told NNPC officials that the legality of the contract was questionable, and warned: 'Please make it clear to all concerned that the top management of NNPC are dealing with a scandal of major proportions in this matter.' Further correspondence exchanged between NNPC and Mr Asiodu suggests that company officials ignored his directives, and had already authorised payments totalling Dollars 16.5m to the contractors in January and February 1993. Mr Asiodu left office on August 26. In the interview in London Mr Asiodu also re-jected criticism of decisions he had taken while minister on oil lifting contracts and the award of exploration licences. In both areas he was dealing with a backlog of claims and applications inherited from his predecessor, said Mr Asiodu. 'If I had any skeletons to hide in the ministry, I would have chosen to remain there,' he said.</p>

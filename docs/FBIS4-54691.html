			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina  Network in Serbo-Croatian at 0800 GMT on 4 May within its  regular 8-minute newscast carries several reports on the  situation in the republic.    Hamiz Deronjic reports that "artillery attacks on the  defense  lines of the free Brcko territory are becoming more and more  frequent and intensive. Thus, during last night, the Serbian  aggressor fired 82-mm mortars on the positions of the 108th  Motorized Brigade and the 108th Infantry Brigade, as well as  [word indistinct] units of the 2d Corps in Krajinovici,  Vitanovici, [name indistinct], the central section of the  battlefield, and the region of Modrica. The region of Vranovaca  was exposed to the most intensive fire from 82-mm and 120-mm  mortars. The aggressor has been incessantly regrouping his  forces on the Brcko battlefield. (?Major) movements of the  enemy's armored-mechanized equipment were observed on the  central sector of the Brcko battlefield last night."    A report by the Press Center of the 3d Corps read by an  unidentified correspondent says that "chetnik provocations on  the Teslic battlefield" have become too much and that  "yesterday, our forces carried out a strong counterattack  whereby they took (Veliki Karanovici) and pressed the enemy  deeply toward (Blato). Fierce fighting was waged on the  Zavidovici region around Mahovski Vrh and, as the final outcome,  the enemy was pushed back. Chetniks are continuing to shell the  zone covered by the 7th South Operations Group. A 90-mm  self-propelled gun [samohodka) at (Lovzije) shelled the village  of Miljkovac, [name indistinct] and Alibegovici. With 82-mm and  120-mm mortars, they showered the village of Lepenica where a  child was wounded. The fact that the chetniks are going to  continue such activities is shown by a column of five tanks that  is heading toward (?Putnikovo Brdo)."    Viktor Boban reports from the Bosna Operations Group Press  Center on "strong artillery fire by the aggressor on the  Mahovski Vrh defense lines yesterday. The chetniks followed the  artillery attack with a strong infantry assault trying to break  through this defense line of the free Zavidovici territory.  After heavy fighting, in the afternoon, the chetniks were  pushed back to their original positions." Further on, Boban  says that "following their defeat, the Chetniks have been fire  fiercely on all defense lines as well as on populated places.  Villages were occasionally shelled with 82-mm and 120-mm  mortars until late into the night. Infantry arms attacks were  launched on the stable defense lines of the 201st Chivalrous  Brigade in Maglaj. Karadzic's paramilitary formations are still  regrouping themselves, as well as bringing in new forces and  military hardware, so new attacks on the zone covered by the  Bosna Operations Group are to be expected."    Mirza Sadikovic reports on the situation in the Bihac region  saying that "[Fikret] Abdic's paramilitary was firing  antiaircraft weapons and heavy machine-guns all last night" and  that "the morning hours are passing as usual, with provocations  on almost all sections of the zone covered by the 5th Corps of  the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Main Headquarters of the  Croatian Defense Council [HVO] of the Bihac region."</p>

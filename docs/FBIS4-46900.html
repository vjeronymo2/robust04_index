			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ildar Tukmakov, deputy chairman of the National </F> Bank of Tatarstan: "Banks Continue To Grow"]    [Text] The continuing development of the banking  system has now been registered in the republic: New banks are  opening; chains of branches, including those outside Tatarstan,  are expanding; statutory funds of banks and their assets are  growing.    As of 1 April of this year 38 registered commercial banks  with 59 branches, of which 11 were outside the republic,  operated in the Republic of Tatarstan.    Compared to 1 January 1992, the number of commercial banks  registered in Tatarstan increased from 17 to 38, and  branches--from eight to 59. During the period in question, the  statutory fund of banks grew from R305.4 million to R28 billion.    In addition, the Tatagroprombank and 49 of its branches  which  mainly serve enterprises and organizations of the  agro-industrial complex and rural rayons of the Republic of  Tatarstan operate in the territory of the republic.    As far as the branches of out-of-town banks are concerned, a  branch of the Inkotransbank commercial bank (Nizhniy Novgorod)  has been opened in Kazan.    Of 38 commercial banks, six are public joint-stock companies  that offer their shares for unrestricted sale; 15 are privately  held joint-stock companies, that is, selling shares only to  their shareholders; 17 banks have been established on a  contributory basis.    At present, 14 commercial banks in the republic hold  licenses  to perform banking operations with foreign exchange which are  issued by the Central Bank of the Russian Federation after at  least one year of banking activities. These banks include the  Tatsotsbank, the Tatpromstroybank (Kazan), and the Kama  Industrial Bank (Naberezhnye Chelny). They hold general licenses  with the right to perform foreign exchange operations both in  the Russian Federation and outside it.    Four commercial banks have an expanded license with a  restricted right to foreign exchange operations with just six  foreign banks. Seven commercial banks have domestic licenses  granting the right to perform foreign exchange operations solely  through correspondent accounts at the banks holding general  licenses.    Based on the results of operations in 1993, commercial banks  contributed to the budget more than R23 billion in the form of  income-based payments, paid to their shareholders and partners  R13.9 billion in dividends, and transferred R8.7 billion to  centralized, insurance, reserve, and other mandatory funds.    Based on the results of operation in the first quarter of  this year, 13 commercial banks turned a loss in the amount of  R4.9 billion.    An analysis of the operation of banks indicates that the  commercial banks generated a loss because of the deterioration  of the repayment of credit and the interest on it by borrowers.    At the same time, almost all banks met their commitments to  pay interest on holdings and the deposits of the population, as  well as on interbank credit, which was reflected in the results  of their operations and the generation of a loss.    The development of the banking system necessitates the  further capitalization of the charters [as published] and assets  of banks, collateral, and guarantees of their reliability and  creditworthiness.    At present, 13 out of 38 commercial banks have statutory  capital amounting to or exceeding R1 billion, including only  seven with statutory capital of R2 billion or more: the  Tatpromstroybank, the Tatsotsbank, the Kaminbank (Naberezhnye  Chelny), the Interkamabank and the Idel-Ural (Nizhnekamsk), the  Selkhozbank (Mendeleyevsk), and the Akbarsbank (Kazan).    Attracting funds to accounts in the banks and subsequently  placing them in the form of credit extended to enterprises and  organizations with all forms of ownership, primarily for  measures associated with the development and support for the  economy of the republic, is one of the significant tasks of  commercial banks.    During the period 1 January of last year and 1 April of this  year, the volume of funds raised through bank accounts increased  from R147.1 billion to R1,061.1 billion, including those  attracted in the form of holdings--from R9.1 billion to R100.5  billion, and in the form of deposits of the population--from  R0.7 billion to R75 billion.    Efforts to attract interbank credit were stepped up,  including its attraction through a chain of branches in other  regions. As of 1 April of this year, interbank credit from other  regions exceeded R65 billion.    We should note in particular efforts to attract the deposits  of the population and pay to it guaranteed interest rates as  protection against systematic inflation and depreciation of the  currency. The efforts of banks in this area are not easy; they  entail credit risks and direct losses to individual banks.  Despite this, such efforts are made in the interests of the  entire population.    With a view to assisting their clients in overcoming the  payments crisis and facilitating the acceleration of settlements  with enterprises in other regions, the commercial banks of the  republic, in addition to expanding the chain of their branches,  are vigorously establishing correspondent relations by way of  opening correspondent accounts at other banks and effecting  out-of-town payments between relevant enterprises through them.    The Volga-Kama Joint-Stock Bank has an extensive network of  correspondent accounts which make it possible to perform direct  settlements, including in Moscow, St. Petersburg, Izhevsk,  Chelyabinsk, Perm, Kaliningrad, Rostov-on-Don, Novosibirsk,  Nizhniy Novgorod, Ulyanovsk, and Yaketerinburg.    Along with the Volga-Kama Bank, the Tatpromstroybank, the  Tatsotsbank, the Zarechye, the Kambiznesbank, the Kama  Industrial Bank, the Avtogradbank, and the MNB Continent  vigorously operate in this area.    Last year, 20 commercial banks floated 32 issues of  securities registered by the National Bank in the form of bank  shares. The banks placed the securities both among their  shareholders and by way of unrestricted sales to the population.    At the same time, despite the fact that six public  joint-stock banks, i.e. banks whose shares may be freely sold  and bought on the on the secondary market (exchanges), operate  in Tatarstan at present, only the shares of the Volga-Kama  Joint-Stock Banks are quoted on the Moscow Central Stock  Exchange. This indicates the poor activity of the banks in the  securities market both in the republic and outside of it.    In addition to shares, the National Bank has registered  conditions for the issuance of deposit and savings certificates  of commercial banks; last year, six banks issued their own bank  bills of exchange.    The aforementioned securities (certificates, bills of  exchange) are issued for the purpose of both raising funds in  bank accounts and effecting settlements with them without  withdrawing the corresponding ready cash from the banks.    The unstable economic situation causes changes in the  operation of commercial banks.    Despite the general growth of the resource base of  commercial  banks, a number of banks are experiencing a considerable  resource shortage. Within the structure of attracted funds, a  considerable growth of nontraditional sources of credit  resources has been registered, specifically, of credit received  from other banks, holdings, and deposits.    The extension of credit for periods of no more than three  months, and at individual banks for periods of no more than one  month, has developed extensively.    Complex economic policies necessitate adjustments in the  investment policy of commercial banks, too. At present, they  prefer to extend credit for operations involving tangible  merchandise while formalizing the collateral and insuring their  credit.    In generalizing the above, we should note yet again that the  banks of the republic are now vigorously mastering a broad array  of banking services on the basis of perfecting technical support  for them and improving the professionalism of the banks.</p>

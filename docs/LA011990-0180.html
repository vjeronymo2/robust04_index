			<p><P> January 19, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> AIR PASSENGER BODY CALLS FOR SECURITY LEVY: $1 PER TICKET  </P> <P> An organization that represents airline passengers today called for a $1 levy  on all air tickets to finance a $1-billion program to improve airline security  and fight terrorism.  </P> <P> Geoffrey Lipman, secretary-general of the International Foundation for Airline  Passengers, said such a fund would contribute toward research into more  sophisticated security technology and improved training of airline staff,  particularly in Third World countries.  </P> <P> He cited a survey by the foundation that showed that 80% of travelers  questioned would support such a charge on tickets. The proposed fund would  supplement existing security expenditures by governments and airlines, Lipman  added.  </P> <P> Some U.S. airlines, such as Pan Am and Trans World Airlines, add $5 to the cost  of a transatlantic ticket to cover security screening for international  flights.  </P></p>

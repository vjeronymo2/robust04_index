The series of preferential policies and deepening of the  internal reforms of the foreign trade system have effectively  helped expand the scope of business activities with foreign  enterprises and regions.    By the end of 1993, the number of foreign trade companies,  border barter-trade companies and export-oriented industrial  enterprises being granted the managerial rights in imports and  exports all over the 12 leagues and cities of Inner Mongolia  exceeded 90, an increase of about 30 percent over the previous  year.    Agency services of the 90-plus privileged economic entities  have channeled products of thousands of enterprises of Inner  Mongolia to international markets and introduced foreign  technology and products to domestic markets.    Last year, trade volume of imports and exports of the  autonomous region reached 1.2 billion U.S. dollars, increasing  by 28.2 percent over that of the previous year.    According to local foreign trade officials, more and more  foreign investors have recognized the growing importance of  Inner Mongolia, which set up economic ties with 82 countries and  regions of the world in the year 1993.    Foreign-funded enterprises have mushroomed in fields like  energy, transportation, machinery, electronics, building  materials and textiles with capital coming from 31 countries and  regions including the United States, Russia, Japan and the  Republic of Korea.    International economic and technological cooperation have  also been expanded. The region has signed contracts for 143  labor service and construction projects with foreign countries.

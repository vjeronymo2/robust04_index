			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / Survey of Emerging Markets (14): Foreign buyers cast a spell  -India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka Stock markets in India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka have all fallen under the spell of the foreign buyer in the past year. International fund managers, flush with money for emerging markets, have put money into all three countries, pushing equities to record levels in Karachi and Colombo and close to record levels in Bombay. The Karachi Stock Exchange's index rose by 74 per cent last year, the Colombo Stock Exchange index of leading stocks by 73 per cent and the Bombay Stock Exchange's index of 30 top shares by 29 per cent. Each country has its attractions for foreign investors. India is in the throes of its biggest economic reforms since independence; it has weathered many political shocks, including the assassinations of two prime ministers and last year's religious riots; its markets are potentially the largest in the world after China. Moreover, foreign portfolio investment has been permitted only since late 1992 - so international fund managers must build their holdings virtually from nothing. A single foreign investor may not hold more than 5 per cent of any Indian stock. Foreign investors as a whole are limited to a combined 24 per cent. Foreign investors enjoy special concessionary tax rates - tax on short-term capital gains is levied at 30 per cent on foreigners (51.75-57.75 per cent for Indian investors). Gains on stocks held for more than a year are taxed at just 10 per cent for foreign investors (46 per cent for most Indians.). The taxes are payable prior to repatriation of profits, which can then be freely converted into foreign exchange. India offers investors a large market with some 7,000 listed companies, quoted on 22 stock exchanges of which the biggest is the Bombay Stock Exchange, accounting for about two-thirds of total turnover. The BSE's total capitalisation exceeds USDollars 100bn. However, only about 2,000 shares are actively traded and only about 200 of these are traded in volumes large enough to attract foreign investors. The Bombay Stock Exchange is run largely by its member brokers, who have been repeatedly criticised for alleged insider trading, mis-pricing investors' transactions for their own benefit and ignoring accounting rules. Most recently, the parliamentary report into the 1992 Bombay securities market scandal dealt extensively with the BSE's alleged regulatory shortcomings. The Securities and Exchange Board, the markets watchdog established in 1992, has recently forced the BSE to raise its standards of service for investors. At the time of writing, it had ordered brokers to suspend an untransparent informal forward market, known as badla, in an effort to curb abuses. Internationally-minded brokers are pressing the BSE for reforms, including the planned introduction of computer-based trading, which should eventually speed transactions and settlements, reducing the scope for cheating. Today, settlement periods run to one week for the most actively-traded stocks and two weeks for others. The exchange has been hit by several brokers' strikes in the recent past, which cause delays and undermine confidence. Investment by foreigners is limited to institutions which have secured prior approval from SEBI. Non-resident Indians, treated as a special category under many Indian laws, may invest without prior authorisation. About 130 institutions have secured SEBI approval, but only around 15 of these are investing actively. The others are in the process of preparing and launching funds. Bombay has a long tradition of western-style commercial services, such as book-keeping and legal advice. Nevertheless, services geared to the needs of foreign portfolio investors are still in their infancy. There is, for example, a grave shortage of custodial services. Pakistan has been open to large-scale foreign portfolio investment since the early 1990s and foreigners now own an estimated 5-7 per cent of Pakistani equities. Pakistan has undertaken considerably more radical pro-market reforms than India, but its attraction for foreign investors is clouded by the disruption caused by power struggles in the ruling elite. Ms Benazir Bhutto's recent return to the prime ministership has prompted a sharp rally in equities, though doubts remain about her ability to bring long-term political stability. The Karachi Stock Exchange lists about 650 companies with a combined value of about USDollars 12bn. About one third of all companies are in textiles, Pakistan's biggest industry. Settlement takes place on Mondays, with at least seven days break between trading and settlement, a period which runs to a maximum of 13 days. The cumbersome trading and settlement procedures give rise to complaints of brokers mis-pricing trades and of insider trading. Foreign investors are free to buy up to 100 per cent of any stock. There is no tax on stock market capital gains and no restrictions on the repatriation of profits. Sri Lanka has been carrying out market-oriented reforms since the end of socialist-inspired policies in the mid-1970s. Thanks to its relatively small size, it has become by far the most internationally-oriented economy in south Asia, with exports accounting for about one third of GDP. Foreigners account for half the trading on the Colombo Stock Exchange. Shares rose rapidly last year in spite of the assassinations of an opposition leader and of former president Mr Ranasinghe Premadasa and an escalation in the civil war with Tamil separatists in the north. Investors are impressed that none of these events seemed to disturb the country's political stability. There are no limits on foreign shareholdings in Sri Lankan companies, with the exception of banks and a few other companies regarded as strategically-important. There is no capital gains tax on stock investment profits, but investors who make a business of buying and selling shares in Sri Lanka might be liable for income tax (if they are individuals) and corporate tax (if companies). There are no restrictions on repatriating profits. The Colombo Stock Exchange is fully computerised and a model of efficiency in south Asia. Settlement takes place in five days for buyers and seven days for sellers. There are 201 listed companies with a total market value of just under USDollars 3bn.

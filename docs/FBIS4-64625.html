			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Delcroix Wants To Increase Army </F> Budget"]    [Text] Belgian Defense Minister Leo Delcroix believes that  the military budget needs to be increased. Yesterday, the  minister was answering questions from reporters during the  "Joint Effort 1994" maneuver, a staff exercise in which a  complete division is deployed to impose and enforce peace on  behalf of the United Nations.    Minister Delcroix said "that a political consensus is  emerging in favor of once again increasing funding for the Army  in the following legislative session." He urges less rapid  participation in UN operations, but said that such participation  should be better prepared and equipped with more resources.    Under the leadership of Lieutenant General Francis  Briquemont, the former UN commander in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the  Army is holding a staff exercise through today in Leopoldsburg  [Belgium]. In such exercises, no units are deployed on the  ground but realistic procedures are followed. The goal of the  exercise is peace enforcement, restoring peace through the  potential deployment of all possible means.</p>

			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / Political patronage remains Sicilian Mafia's trump card: Robert Graham in Rome explains why Italy's post-war battle against organised crime has failed THE killing of Mr Paolo Borsellino, the leading anti-Mafia magistrate, on Sunday, highlights two fundamental failings in the state's post-war campaign against organised crime in Sicily and southern Italy - lack of co-ordination and the inability to clean up the links between politicians and the Mafia. Italy deploys over 250,000 carabinieri, police and financial police throughout the country with a high proportion in the south, and overall the country has the highest per capita ratio in uniform in the EC. But the different forces are beset by rivalries and lack central co-ordination of information and investigation. These jealousies and rivalries have delayed the introduction of a new central co-ordinating force, modelled on the American FBI, agreed last October. There have been delays also in the introduction of a 'super-magistrate', with special assistants in 26 regional offices, to co-ordinate the judicial side of anti-Mafia investigation at a national level. Magistrates have been locked in a heated controversy with the interior ministry for six months over fears that such a move would place too much power in the hands of politicians over the control of appointments. This controversy held back the appointment of Mr Giovanni Falcone - the anti-Mafia magistrate murdered in May - to the job for which the unfortunate Mr Borsellino then became next in line. Legislation has to pass through so many hurdles causing enormous delays in implementation. A set of laws designed to bolster measures to fight racketeering and extortion, one of the most pervasive aspects of organised crime, only became operative in June, nearly nine months after being approved by the cabinet. It is also a question of making laws work. Since 1982 no fewer than 113 laws and decrees have been issued to combat organised crime. But laws designed to counter money laundering have been enmeshed in disputes between the Treasury and the Interior Ministry; while the use of super-grass testimony - pioneered by Mr Falcone, and the most successful means of convicting the bosses, has yet to be properly defined and adequate protection given to those wishing to turn evidence. The judiciary itself is divided. While the vast majority are honest and dedicated, organised crime has the resources to suborn and intimidate. Recently a prominent clerk of the court in Rome processing all the sensitive Mafia files was discovered to have been in the Mafia's pay, deliberately ensuring key papers were lost or arrived late so that known criminals were released from bail. More disturbing is the capacity to intimidate demonstrated by the Falcone and Borsellino killings, and a string of earlier murders. After the Falcone assassination in May it was discovered that the court of Caltanissetta, due to investigate his death, lacked the requisite magistrates because too few wished to serve in such an exposed place. Volunteers had to be hastily drafted in. But the Sicilian Mafia's trump card continues to be the complicity it enjoys with important elements of society, notably the politicians. The issue of corrupt municipal administration is a national problem, but its infiltration by organised crime is a phenomenon of southern Italy which accounts for the majority of the 26 councils forcibly dissolved for abuse of office by the interior ministry in the past nine months. The Christian Democrats and Socialists bear a major part of the blame. They have sustained their dominating presence through patronage of public works contracts and sizeable development projects. It is no accident that 75 per cent of all contracts in Sicily are awarded by private tender. This element of patronage also explains in good measure the manner in which these two parties retained their vote in the April general elections in the south but lost on average 15 points of their vote in the north. A major figure in this shadowy world was Mr Salvatore Lima, the Christian Democrat Euro-deputy and the most powerful politician in Sicily, who was murdered for as yet unspecified motives at the beginning of the general election campaign in March. The party has observed total silence on his killing.</p>

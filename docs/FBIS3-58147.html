It is necessary to re-establish the truth and to see to it  that these slanders are not allowed to cast "absolutely  unjustified shadows" over the landscape at a time already fairly  harrowing for the nation's institutions, he said.    Renewed and immediately denied allegations by former Sisde  domestic secret service treasurer Maurizio Broccoletti,  interrogated after his extradition from Montecarlo this past  week, of money for government politicians and a top-level  cover-up, have also involved President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro and  two recent interior ministers, in addition to the present holder  of the interior portfolio.    All have firmly denied the allegations and, yesterday,  Mancino asked national police chief Vincenzo Parisi to stay in  his post despite reports that he, too, had been placed under  investigation by the magistrates handling the Sisde probe.    According to Assistant Prosecutor Michele Coiro, new  testimony from ex-Sisde officials naming Mancino would be sent  to the Ministers' Tribunal responsible for judging cases filed  against government ministers.    Interviewed for the TG1 [First News Brodcast] newscast on  the  RAI [Italian State Radio and Television] first channel, Coiro  said the testimony contained no new facts, but had to be passed  on so that the tribunal would enjoy "the fullness of  information." He added that the prosecutor's office is arguing  simply that Mancino has no case to answer. Legal sources also  pointed out that a prosecutor has an official duty to enter a  name on the list of those entering an enquiry, even if only  because they are subject to accusation in the testimony of  someone undergoing questioning. "It's a purely formal act,"  Coiro pointed out. "As the chief prosecutor has already  explained, in the very moment when a request was filed to shelve  the allegation, he decided it was pointless to enter Minister  Mancino on the register."    Earlier, Chief Prosecutor Vittorio Mele told reporters that  Broccoletti's allegations of top-level meetings to cover up the  misuse of Sisde funds concerned meetings or "separate  encounters," in any case not held at the Quirinale presidential  residence.    In his interview, Coiro said neither he nor his colleagues  could report Broccoletti's statements in detail, but he  confirmed that both Broccoletti and former Sisde director  Riccardo Malpica had mentioned the meetings.    As some MPs from the governing majority started voicing  fears  that the situation may be too obscure to allow President Oscar  Luigi Scalfaro to go ahead with calling elections, Coiro also  confirmed the existence of "facts" suggesting an attempt at  destabilising the institutions. In particular, he said most  media had carried the report of Broccoletti's alleged reference  to three cover-up meetings when this was in fact "an absolutely  false item of news." He also said a similar argument had been  applied to leaks that Police Chief Vincenzo Parisi was on the  list of those under investigation.    "A group of magistrates is investigating the question,  trying  to see if there is anything in this attack on the president's  prerogatives," he reported, "to try and understand who and why."    In a lengthy interview with ANSA, Mancino said of the Parisi  case that, whether or not the entry on the list of those who  have entered into an enquiry was secret or public, it allows  "no-one to throw even a shadow on the person in question."    Being entered on the register authorises no-one to "even  advance a suspicion against the chief-of-police or anyone else  in the same position," he said, although he admitted that the  situation would change if the person was moved from the list of  those entering an enquiry to those who have been notified they  are under investigation for a given crime. Someone can  naturally be re-examined, but a `new fact' would be needed,"  Mancino said, charging that he had "never known the truth" from  Malpica, who was director of Sisde from February 1987 to August  1991.    Mancino, who supported Malpica for his subsequent  appointment  as special government commissioner in Turin, added that the  ex-Sisde head "enjoyed the whole Interior Ministry's esteem."    "When we spoke of the question of Sisde's funds, he seemed  to me to be a third party extraneous to the appropriation of  public funds, but I was told there were secret service cover or  guarantee certificates (for the funds)," said Mancino of charges  that the accused secret service officials are withholding 14  billion lire in government money, but had claimed the existence  of certificates proving they held the money on the intelligence  services' behalf.    "...I had no interest in covering up operations for the  appropriation of public funds, nor did I have any interest in  covering up for Malpica, also because at the time, I was unaware  of any eventual responsibilities on his part."    The Interior Minister also claimed that he had "never known"  what secret service cover or guarantee certificates were before  his conversations with secret service officials on the 14  billion lire.    Adding that he was someone who found "great difficulty" in  reading his own bank account, Mancino commented: "I may be  regarded as being inexpert, but someone who is unaware of how  the mechanism of these cover certificates works can hardly be  called to account for a defensive line concerning them." But if  this is what Malpica is in fact arguing, Mancino added, "he is  lying, and knows he is."    Mancino was equally adamant about reported allegations that  he was one of the Interior Ministers who had received personal  bonus payments from the secret funds or had taken part in  cover-up meetings. Of the first, he said: "No-one ever  mentioned these support payments to me. No-one ever proposed  support payments to me, and I would in any case have turned them  down. No-one will ever be able to argue the contrary."    On the second, he said: "I have never taken part (in  meetings of this kind) at the Quirinale, the Interior Ministry,  or anywhere else. No-one will ever be able to show that I  brought together a few prefects in order to cover for persons  whom I didn't even know."    In addition, he denied ever having given advice to anyone on  the Sisde affair or agreed to a line of defence in it: "I have  always had bilateral meetings (with Interior Minister officials)  for duties inherent in my office...and I have always hoped that  the magistrates were informed of the issues discussed in the  same terms in which Prefect Finocchiaro and later Prefect  Malpica too explained them to me."    Admitting that some people purvey "incomplete or distorted"  information, Mancino agreed that the political situation was  "shot through with not always clear, probably turbid interests"  which, by putting his name in the headlines in connection with  facts about which he knew nothing, harm "my person, the  institutions, the general context..."    "Certainly, we are living through a transitional phase which  should be seconded within respect for the institutional rules.  This transition is encouraged by some, desired by others, and  opposed by still others. One should see, then if among the  latter, there aren't some interests being cultivated to weaken  the image of the state and the institutions, in order to weaken  the constitutional and institutional organs."    On his term at the Interior Ministry, Mancino said he put  "intellectual honesty, firmness and determination" into the job.  He also claimed not to have favoured the traditional policies,  citing in particular the fact that he had dissolved "over fifty"  city councils in order to break the link between elected  officials and organised crime.    He also claimed credit for motivating the police,  contributing to the capture of long-sought criminals, and  "firing point-blank" at "secret lodges and other deviations  against democratic order."    "In short," he asserted, "I can hardly deny that I have  delivered blows, and heavy ones at that."</p>

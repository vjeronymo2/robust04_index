			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / Observer: Sir Bryan gets the call One of the first big jobs of any new president of the CBI is to find his successor, so its Centre Point headquarters yesterday emitted a puff of white smoke signifying that former Post Office chairman Sir Bryan Nicholson is being groomed as the senior voice of British industry and commerce at home and abroad. It will be another 15 months before the current president, ex-Unilever boss Sir Michael Angus, steps down. But the CBI is rather like civil service departments in the matter of planning succession. Clearly, Sir Bryan has proved his mettle in its committees and is being prepared for permanent membership of the great and the good. Despite present unemployment levels, finding the right man for the job is less easy than it may sound. It's a two-year unpaid post, involving at least two days' work a week. True, it has perks such as a chance to hobnob with the prime minister and pontificate about what's wrong with Britain. But it's not a job suited to a chief executive who is trying to run a business full-time. Both Angus and his predecessor Sir Brian Corby of the Pru were at the end of their executive careers when they got the call, and Nicholson has just given up running the Post Office. He looks as good a choice as any, although the CBI won't say whether it tried to sign up others such as Guinness's Sir Anthony Tennant, or Shell's Sir Peter Holmes.</p>

Hot-work permits shall be issued to prohibit draining and flushing operations in the processing building during operations that may generate a source of ignition. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 16. Draining and flushing operations shall not take place in the processing building when a hot work permit is issued for repairs in that building. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 17. No ignitable waste shall be processed in uncontrolled areas and, during loading and unloading operations, transportation vehicles containing ignitable substances shall be secured to prevent movement and grounded to reduce the potential for static discharge. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 18. All pumps, hoses, valves, and connections shall be checked by system operators for leaks and ruptures prior to initiating each draining and flushing operation, and at least once daily by designated inspectors/supervisors during regular operating hours. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 19. Leaking drums shall be placed in overpack drums. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 20. Direct ventilation of the processing building shall be provided during the draining and flushing operations by a wall-mounted exhaust fan located adjacent to the processing area. This fan shall circulate air at 12,000 cubic feet per minute ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  18 air changes per hour), and shall be capable of operating under auxiliary electric power.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 21. The processing building shall be vented by roof-mounted turbine vents. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 22. The processing system shall be provided with a series of interlocks to prevent liquid spills. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 23. Inspectors/supervisors shall inspect the processing building and tank areas for spills on a daily basis. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 24. A detailed Contingency Plan for managing spills shall be available at the facility. This Plan shall consist of written procedures established to minimize, contain, mitigate, and expeditiously remove liquid spills (containing PCBs, ignitable liquids, and combinations thereof) that may occur in the facility. These written procedures shall be posted near areas where spills are likely to occur, and all employees are to receive documented training annually on these procedures. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 25. All spills shall be cleaned immediately. Small spills shall be removed by using designated sorbents and containers. Large spills shall be contained using diking materials if necessary. Work shall be performed in diked/curbed areas where the potential for spills is high. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 26. During spill removal, the following safety procedures shall be observed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. Contact with the spilled material shall be avoided; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b.

The area shall be ventilated; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> e. Personnel exposed in any manner to the spilled material shall be decontaminated thoroughly using eyewashes and bodywashes available in the processing area; this decontamination shall occur immediately following spill removal; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> f. Technical advice shall be obtained as necessary. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 27. Authorities shall be notified if the spilled material escapes downstream. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 28. All tanks containing ignitable waste shall meet American Society for Testing and Materials specifications for ignitables, and shall be grounded to prevent sparking and potential ignition. These tanks shall be fitted with discharge valves with fusible links that close in case of a fire emergency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 29. Storage tanks shall be adequately maintained; these tanks shall be checked prior to pumping ignitable liquids into the tanks to assure that there is ample space to accommodate the liquid, and that the proper tanks are being filled with flushed liquids. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Upon receipt of this order, Envirosafe Services, Inc. shall give affected employees notice of the terms contained herein using the same means required to inform them of the variance application. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This order shall become effective on June 7, 1994, and shall remain in effect until modified or revoked in accordance with section 6(d) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Signed at Washington, DC, this 23d day of May 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Joseph A.

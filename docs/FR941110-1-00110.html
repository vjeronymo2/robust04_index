			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (B) If EPA's records show that the convertor has insufficient  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unexpended Article 5 allowances to cover the conversion claim, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the convertor has failed to respond to one or more Agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requests to supply information needed to make a determination,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Administrator will issue a notice disallowing the conversion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Within 10 working days after receipt of notification, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> convertor may file a notice of appeal, with supporting reasons,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the Administrator. The Administrator may affirm or vacate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the disallowance. If no appeal is taken by the tenth working day  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> after notification, the disallowance shall be final on that day.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) In the event that the Administrator does not respond to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a conversion claim within the three working days specified in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, the convertor may proceed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the conversion. EPA will reduce the convertor's balance of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unexpended allowances by the amount to be converted. However, if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA ultimately finds that the convertor did not have sufficient  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unexpended allowances to cover the claims, the convertor will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> held liable for any violations of the regulations of this subpart  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that occur as a result of, or in conjunction with, the improper  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conversion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Effective January 1, 1996, any person (``convertor'') may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> convert destruction and/or transformation credits for one class I  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> controlled substance to the same type of credits for another  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> class I controlled substance within the same group of controlled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substances as the first as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) The convertor must submit to the Administrator a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conversion claim setting forth the following:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) The identity and address of the convertor;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) The name and telephone number of a contact person for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> convertor;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (C) The type of destruction and/or transformation credits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> being converted, including the names of the controlled substances  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for which credits are to be converted;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (D) The group of controlled substances to which the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> destruction and/or transformation credits being converted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pertains;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (E) The amount and type of credits to be converted;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (F) The amount of credits to be subtracted from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> convertor's unexpended credits for the first controlled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substance, to be equal to 101 percent of the amount of credits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> converted;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (G) The amount of destruction and/or transformation credits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to be added to the convertor's unexpended credits for the second  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> controlled substance, to be equal to the amount of credits for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the first controlled substance being converted multiplied by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quotient of the ozone depletion factor of the first controlled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substance divided by the ozone depletion factor of the second  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> controlled substance, as listed in Appendix A to this subpart.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (H) The control period(s) for which the destruction and/or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transformation credits are being converted; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (I) The amount of unexpended destruction and/or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transformation credits for the control period being converted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the convertor holds under authority of this subpart as of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the date the claim is submitted to EPA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The Administrator will determine whether the records  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maintained by EPA, taking into account any previous conversions,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any transfers, and any production, imports (not including  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transhipments, or used controlled substances), or exports (not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> including transhipments, exports for destruction or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transformation, or used controlled substances) of controlled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substances reported by the convertor, indicate that the convertor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> possesses, as of the date the conversion claim is processed,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unexpended destruction and/or transformation credits sufficient  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to cover the conversion claim (i.e., the amount to be converted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> plus one percent of that amount). Within three working days of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> receiving a complete conversion claim, the Administrator will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> take action to notify the convertor as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) If EPA's records show that the convertor has sufficient  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unexpended destruction and/or transformation credits to cover the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conversion claim the Administrator will issue a notice indicating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that EPA does not object to the conversion and will reduce the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> convertor's balance of unexpended credits by the amount to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> converted plus one percent of that amount. When EPA issues a no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> objection notice, the convertor may proceed with the conversion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, if EPA ultimately finds that the convertor did not have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sufficient unexpended destruction and/or transformation credits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to cover the claim, the convertor will be held liable for any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> violations of the regulations of this subpart that occur as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> result of, or in conjunction with, the improper conversion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) If EPA's records show that the convertor has insufficient  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unexpended destruction and/or transformation credits to cover the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conversion claim, or that the convertor has failed to respond to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> one or more Agency requests to supply information needed to make  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a determination, the Administrator will issue a notice  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disallowing the conversion. Within 10 working days after receipt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of notification, the convertor may file a notice of appeal, with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supporting reasons, with the Administrator. The Administrator may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> affirm or vacate the disallowance. If no appeal is taken by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tenth working day after notification, the disallowance shall be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> final on that day.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) In the event that the Administrator does not respond to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a conversion claim within the three working days specified in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the convertor may proceed with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the conversion. EPA will reduce the convertor's balance of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unexpended destruction and/or transformation credits by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amount to be converted plus one percent of that amount. However,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> if EPA ultimately finds that the convertor did not have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sufficient unexpended destruction and/or transformation credits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to cover the claims, the convertor will be held liable for any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> violations of the regulations of this subpart that occur as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> result of, or in conjunction with, the improper conversion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Effective January 1, 1995, and for every control period  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> thereafter, inter-pollutant trades will be permitted during the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 45 days after the end of a control period. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

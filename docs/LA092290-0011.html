			<p><P> September 22, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATIONALISTIC DREAMS OF UNITY IN MIDDLE EAST  </P> <P> This is regarding your editorial ("Don't Underrate Tehran's Cynicism," Sept.  14) in which you assume that "the enemy of my enemy is my friend" is  permissible in Islamic society. I want to point out that your assumption is  absolutely wrong because this game is strictly an invention of secular society  aimed at dividing the people, thereby producing different constituencies for  the purpose of exploitation.  </P> <P> Although everyone, including President Bush, seems to be perplexed by the  current Middle East crisis, there should be no doubt in anyone's mind that it  is this secular game which is primarily responsible for our dilemma. One would  hope it is still not too late to learn a lasting lesson from this unfortunate  experience.  </P> <P> Incidentally, in an Islamic society, friend of a friend is considered a friend.  </P> <P> M.

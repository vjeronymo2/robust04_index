			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / International Company News: SA group ahead as a result of shake-up Tongaat-Hulett, the South African food, industrial and consumer products group and the largest company in Natal province, reported a strong second half as a result of successful rationalisation and restructuring. After-tax profits for the year ended March rose 15.8 per cent to R159m (Dollars 32.1m) from R137.3m. The results were helped by a decline in net financing costs to R55.2m from R77.4m and a drop in taxation to R52.1m from R55.3m. The balance sheet was stronger as overall borrowings were down to R364.6m from R388.9m, while total net borrowings dropped to R25.3m, a reduction of R107.9m, largely due to proceeds from the sale of 50 per cent of the group's Consumer Foods operation to CPC International. Turnover increased 2.7 per cent to R3.97bn from R3.87bn and a final dividend of 58 cents was declared, making the full-year dividend 13.7 per cent up on last year, at 83 cents. Mr Cedric Savage, managing director, said the improvement held across all divisions and improved liquidity and cash-flows would allow the company to take advantage of expected infrastructural spending by the new government. He singled out the group's brickmaking and aluminium divisions as particularly well placed for growth. The sugar division, recovering from a two-year drought, is expected to benefit from deregulation later in the year. Tongaat has also continued with capital expenditure, spending R180m on various irrigation, glucose and aluminium projects. The group is also undertaking feasibility studies for a proposed R1.6bn hot rolling aluminium mill expansion. Mr Savage also said anticipated growth and higher liquidity left the company well placed for new investments, perhaps in foreign markets.</p>

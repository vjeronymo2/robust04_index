			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / Survey of the Restucturing of Eastern Germany (2): A slow climb from the abyss - The economy will need another five years of massive investment In two crucial ways, 1993 was a turning point for the east German economy. For the first time since German unification in October, 1990, and indeed since economic and monetary union on July 1 that year, production rose faster than overall demand in the former Communist territory. Up till then, stagnating output was steadily outstripped by a growth in demand fuelled by transfers from west Germany. Secondly, and possibly more significant still, investment per capita in the east for the first time exceeded the level in the west. Both indicators suggest that at last, after a period of free fall, followed by prolonged stagnation, the east German economy is just beginning the process of catching up on the wealthy west. The question is, can the process be sustained? And if it can, how long will it take? On the negative side, it is clear that east Germany is still far from generating the profits it needs to finance its own indigenous investment process: the so-called wage quota - the amount of national income devoted to wages and salaries - is more than 100 per cent. That means no profits are being generated, and all investment is in effect financed by transfers from the west. Those transfers held up remarkably well in 1993, but given the depth of the western recession, investment plans for 1994/95 are in some doubt. And just as east German industry is beginning to pick up, the recession is also squeezing consumer spending in its most important market. The divergence of the two German economies, east and west, was and is enormous. The collapse of the east German economy happened within weeks of monetary union. West German industry moved in rapidly to fill the vacuum. And the fear is that the former Communist state's entire industrial base has been wiped out in the process, leaving the so-called new federal states in danger of becoming an industrial and economic backwater, an eastern Mezzogiorno on the fringes of western Europe. The recovery of the eastern economy is still in the balance, but for the first time, positive signs of recovery are starting to multiply. Mr Udo Ludwig, chief economist at the economic research institute in Halle - the first eastern institute to be set up since unification  - sees the glass as half full. 'We are in the middle of a recovery process borne by private and public investment,' he says. 'They are installing modern productive capacity. It will amount to a real recovery when for the first time eastern products can supply most of eastern needs. And profits have to be big enough to provide for refinancing. The process will take a generation.' Mr Heiner Flassbeck, the chief economist at Berlin's economic research institute (DIW), tends to see the glass as half empty. 'The catching up process has started in 1993, but it will be very difficult for east Germany to have a higher growth rate than west Germany over a prolonged period,' he says. 'At the best, they can expect to grow at the same rate, which means the chance of catching up is called into question. 'It is much easier to make profits in the west than in the east.' The hard-headed managers at Deutsche Bank have a rule of thumb for the survival prospects of new businesses: they call it the seven year rule. 'Our investigations show that only after seven years can one say an enterprise is really established,' says Mr Udo Vorstius, a former manager in the western industrial heartland of the Ruhr, now transferred to run Deutsche Bank's operations in Halle, the east German equivalent. 'We are nowhere near that point here, especially as far as small businesses are concerned. It is clear that overall something is moving, but the nervous phase is far from over.' The evidence of catching up comes in the latest report by three independent economic research institutes* for the Economics Ministry, on the overall process of adjustment in eastern Germany. The index of manufacturing production slumped from a level of 100 in the second half of 1990 (already well below the level in the first half) to a low point of 61.8 by the second quarter of 1992. From the first quarter of 1991 to the same quarter of 1993, it stayed around the same level. Since then it has steadily recovered: to 67.7 in the second quarter of 1993, 72.7 by the third quarter, and 77.8 by the end of the year. In the same period, industrial orders have also picked up appreciably: by the last quarter of 1993 to 91.8 per cent of the level in the second half of 1990. The orders are coming overwhelmingly from the domestic economy, with much less buoyancy in export orders, where eastern enterprises were overwhelmingly dependent on the east European and former Soviet markets. On the downside, industrial production is still less than 40 per cent of its former level before unification, so the recovery is coming from a very low base. Unemployment stands officially at 1.26m, or 16.8 per cent of an already much reduced workforce, without taking into account several hundred thousand more on short-time working, job creation schemes and retraining. The overall number of economically active people has dropped over the period from nearly 10m to under 6m. The rest, many of them women, have simply left the labour market in despair. The process of German unification has virtually turned the east German economy on its head. Not only has traditional industrial production collapsed, but the structure of east German industry and employment has been transformed as well. The process was one which many now believe was inevitable, yet which still took most observers in government and industry, as well as the professional economists, by surprise when it happened. The initial collapse came immediately in the wake of monetary union: the exchange rate of one Ostmark for one D-Mark on July 1 meant an effective revaluation of more than 300 per cent for the currency relevant for the economic area of the GDR. At the same time, the open border with west Germany meant that eastern producers were faced with free competition from cheaper, higher quality western products. And eastern consumers showed an instant, and well-nigh blind preference for western products. At the same time, there was an end to measures supporting trade with the eastern bloc, in effect, a second revaluation shock. The net production index dropped by 40 per cent before November, and a further 30 per cent up to March, 1991: from then until 1993, it stagnated at about one third of its pre-monetary union level. The effect was compounded by a wage explosion. In 1989, the average monthly salary of an employee in east Germany was just under DM1,200, or roughly one third of western salaries. Already, in the first half of 1990, unions and enterprises agreed on wage increases of around 17 per cent. The first round of collective wage negotiations in 1991 saw increases in negotiated wage contracts of around 60 per cent. The result was a dramatic deterioration in east German unit wage costs in relation to the west: around 20 per cent higher than those in west Germany immediately after currency union, they rose in 1991 to about 170 per cent of the western level, because of the combined effects of the drop in production and the high wage increases. If the west German government and its eastern agent, the Treuhand privatisation agency, had hoped to preserve and privatise much of the supposedly efficient east German economy, the uncompetitiveness caused by those soaring unit wage costs put paid to it. A more total collapse was only prevented by truly massive transfers of cash from the west, in the form of straight subsidies, instant infrastructure spending programmes, and huge transfers of unemployment and social security benefits. Total financial transfers rose from DM132.1bn in 1991 to around DM170bn last year. The upheaval in east Germany has caused startling changes in its industrial structure in a very short time. The capital goods manufacturing sector has shrunk from about half overall industrial production to no more than two-fifths of the much lower output levels. Mechanical engineering, which in 1990 provided 23.6 per cent of manufacturing output, was down to barely 11 per cent by the end of 1992. Electrical engineering was down from 15.7 to 12.1 per cent, and other technologically leading sectors - such as precision and optical instruments, and data processing equipment - all saw their importance reduced sharply. In contrast, the growth sectors have been food and drinks (up from 12.6 to 18.1 per cent), anything to do with the construction industry, and services. Printing was the one industrial sector which was not affected by the initial collapse: the demand for information remained constant. 'The competitive structure of east German industry has still not crystallised,' says Mr Ludwig. 'It used to be dominated by capital goods. Now it is a manufacturing sector dominated by the food industry. That is not the structure of a developed country. But nor is it the final point. There is a lot of investment in vehicle manufacturing and electrical engineering. There are small signs that our export industry will recover.' There have also been huge changes in the structure of enterprise size: today the dominant size of enterprise is between 100 and 500 employees, in stark contrast to the huge kombinats which dominated communist industry. The greatest area of largely unknown and unmeasured activity is among the smallest enterprises, the indigenous small businesses with fewer than 20 employees. 'My guess is that they are already producing 15 to 20 per cent of what is produced in the measured sectors of industry,' says Mr Ludwig. Neither Mr Ludwig nor Mr Flassbeck believes that the future for east Germany is as a service industry economy. 'There are no special services east Germany can offer,' Mr Flassbeck says. 'Take banking, insurance and other financial services: they all depend on someone earning money from industry. 'We don't have the tourist attractions of a Switzerland. Our future depends on having a highly qualified labour force, and an outstanding infrastructure. 'Recovery depends on how long we will continue to be able to afford to pump in subsidies at the present rate. I think we need to keep up this high investment activity for another five or six years, at least. But that means a huge amount of money, which many in the west do not think they can afford.'  --------------------------------------------------------------------- The changing structure of production in the east German manufacturing                               sector*  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                                    1990 (2nd     1992 (2nd                                     half), %      half), %  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Manufacturing sector                     100           100 Oil refining                             2.2           4.4 Quarrying                                4.8           8.0 Iron and steel products                  2.6           2.4 Foundries                                1.6           0.9 Structural metal products                5.2          12.4 Mechanical engineering                  23.6          11.1 Road vehicles                            3.3           3.2 Electrical engineering                  15.7          12.1 Precision/optical instruments            2.4           1.5 Chemical products                        8.3           7.2 Office machinery                         1.3           0.3 Printing                                 1.6           3.5 Leather processing                       1.2           0.4 Clothing and textiles                    4.1           1.7 Food and beverages                      12.6          18.1  --------------------------------------------------------------------- *Selected sectors;

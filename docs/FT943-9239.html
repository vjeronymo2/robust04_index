			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / Property: Fillip for the young ones - Low prices are attracting first-time buyers While Japan's commercial property market is still in the trough of a four-year slump, the residential sector is enjoying a fillip. Developers, burdened with unsold residential properties, are flooding the market with low-cost flats. Sales are brisk. This uplift has provided relief for property developers, who have been severely affected by the first sustained fall in land prices since the second world war; and the government, which hopes a pick-up in housing sales will help lead the economy out of recession. The sharp rise in sales of flats has been helped by record low mortgage rates - currently 4.05 per cent, down from 5.5 per cent in 1990 - coupled with an expansion in the government's subsidised loan programme for house purchases. During the first six months of this year, a record 34,109 flats came onto the market; in July alone, the number of flats offered by developers jumped by 150 per cent on the same month in 1993, to 10,179, with 85 per cent of total supply sold. The slide in the market following the speculative bubble of the late 1980s has also led to a slump in the price of flats. An average three-room flat in the outskirts of Tokyo declined by 25 per cent from Y60m to Y40m between 1990 and 1993, making it affordable for many Japanese for the first time. Yet the recovery is fragile because prices continue to fall as domestic property sales increase. Despite this rise in sales, surplus supply and vacancy rates continue to shoot up. The rise in residential sales has also increased competition, with commercial property developers, facing a continued slump in office rents, lured back into the market. According to the research arm of Haseko, a leading residential-sector developer, annual demand for flats during the next five years is expected to rise to 45,000 units; but this year alone, 80,000 flats are expected to come onto the market and analysts believe this over-supply will persist for at least three years. Ms Keiko Ohtsuki, real estate analyst at Morgan Stanley, a US investment house, says that in spite of some price stabilisation in the six months to June, the general downward price trend is likely to continue in the medium-term. As a result, developers, enjoying improved revenues after several years of poor earnings, are likely to be forced to further cut their prices for flats, again squeezing their profit margins. The supply of new flats has had a significant impact on the prices of existing residential properties and on the rental markets. Buyers in Japan generally prefer to purchase new housing and low-interest loans have attracted first-time buyers from the rental market in significant numbers. In central Tokyo, housing rents are down by between 10 per cent and 20 per cent from their peak in 1990 and, with the market favouring the consumer, many landlords are willing to negotiate even larger discounts. As with residential prices, commercial property values have also yet to bottom out. Recession-induced corporate restructuring has depressed demand for office space, in particular for high-grade accommodation in central Tokyo. According to Ikoma Data Service, a property research company, vacancy rates in Tokyo have risen to 8.9 per cent from 5.9 per cent a year ago. Development projects started at the peak of the market in the late 1980s are now coming onto the market, exacerbating the glut in office space. Office rents have also fallen by between 30 per cent and 50 per cent from their peak in 1990. With office constructions in leading cities down 47 per cent last year compared with 1992, many in the industry, such as the Japan Real Estate Institute, a think-tank, say it will be another 18 months before the office glut eases. At the same time, market liquidity remains a problem, with developers still reluctant to off-load commercial real estate bought at the market peak in the late 1980s for fear of incurring losses. That is a chief reason why industry analysts believe the easing of the over-supply does not necessarily point to the recovery of the market overall. The stagnant commercial property market remains at the core of the problems at Japan's banks, as the vast bulk of their lending was extended against over-valued land. Banks remain burdened with bad debt write-offs follow-ing their disastrous foray into property lending in the 1980s. In response to their bad debts, banks last year set up the Co-operative Credit Purchasing Corporation. Under this scheme, banks sell their bad loans to CCPC at a discount, writing off the difference. When CCPC was set up in May last year, it bought the banks' bad debts at a 34 per cent discount based on the collateral value. More recently the CCPC has been buying banks' bad debts at a discount of 64.6 per cent. Some market observers say the prolonged downturn of the commercial property market and the increasing costs of maintaining land assets may induce investors to change their investment culture, by shifting their focus away from capital gains and towards a property's income-generating potential. But such a change is likely to come about slowly. Reluctant to sell their assets - owning land is an important status symbol to the Japanese - but at the same time forced to clear their balance-sheets, some investors are selling their holdings to affiliates or other enterprises within the same corporate grouping at artificially high prices. Nevertheless, many Japanese companies will eventually have to succumb to the cost pressures and to abandon their wait-and-see strategy. As Mr Akitoshi Takatsuki, a researcher at Sakura Bank, a leading commercial bank, puts it: 'Companies and investors are aware of the further downside risk of the market, but they are scared to change their ways. To do so would open a Pandora's Box of problems.'</p>

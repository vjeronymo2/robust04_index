			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / Labour calls for banks inquiry The Labour party yesterday called for the banking ombudsman to be made responsible for investigating charges levied by banks. Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, and Mr Alastair Darling, Labour's City spokesman, also called yesterday for the Office of Fair Trading to investigate banks' market shares in lending and providing other services to small businesses. The call for increased oversight of bank charges came after the six largest UK banks reported a 69 per cent rise in first-half profits. Labour said charges had risen sharply since the recession and loan margins remained high.</p>

The elderly Chinese, 60 to 70 years of age, were taken away  in police vehicles from in front of the Japanese Embassy in  Beijing's eastern diplomatic area, witnesses said.    It was not immediately known where the activists, some of  them walking with the aid of canes, were taken.    Although the contents of the letter are not known, the war  compensation activists were believed to be seeking an apology  from the Japanese prime minister who begins a visit to Beijing  on Saturday and to ask for war compensation for Japanese  aggression.    News of the demonstration began circulating Thursday  evening,  leading to speculation that the event was well planned.    One middle-aged man, holding a letter with "Hosokawa"  written  on it in large letters, arrived at the embassy at 10 A.M. and  was immediately taken away, witnesses said. Ten minutes later a  group of elderly men and one woman arrived by minibus and were  also questioned and taken away by police.    The detentions came a week after police rounded up several  political and labor activists before and during the visit of  U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher last weekend.    A Japanese Embassy spokesman said he was unaware of the  demonstration and knew nothing of the detentions.    The Chinese Government has been sensitive to demanding war  compensation for civilian casualties from Japan as it is afraid  it could damage the existing good governmental relations.    A group of delegates to the ongoing National People's  Congress, China's parliament, is presently preparing a motion  demanding war compensation from Japan, but it is not known  whether the central authorities will approve such a document.</p>

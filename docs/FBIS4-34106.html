			<p>BFN     [Text] Cartagena de Indias, 14 Jun (PL) -- Cuban President  Fidel Castro said here today that the time has come to demand  that the United States abide by the UN resolutions condemning  the U.S. blockade imposed on that Caribbean island.    He also demanded a withdrawal from the Navy Base at  Guantanamo, Cuba, from the Panama Canal, and other Latin  American countries in his speech before the Fourth  Ibero-American Summit meeting here.    The Cuban leader referred to the so-called hemispheric event  scheduled by the U.S. Government in Miami in December, and he  said it would provide an opportunity to demand an end to the  "criminal and unfair blockade against Cuba."    After referring to the summit agenda, he said that if those  topics are discussed, "Cuba wishes them success," but he noted  that everything could boil down to "an attempt to establish a  course in the hemisphere to isolate Cuba; to take control of  markets in Latin America and the Caribbean; and to check Europe,  Japan, and the rest of the world."    In that case, he added, one would have to paraphrase Jose  Marti, a Cuban national hero, when a similar event was held in  Washington 105 years ago: "The time has come for Spanish  America to declare its second independence."</p>

The Committee for the Defence of Human Rights (CDHR) said in  a statement that leaders of the two neighbouring nations "can  and should seek" an amicable solution to the conflict in order  to avoid imminent "war that now stares both countries in the  face" "We cannot at this time afford to go on a war whose  disastrous end no one can predict", the statement said. At a  time when Nigerians and Cameroonians were "wallowing in abject  poverty" and yearning for democracy, it was unfortunate that  leaders of the two nations are "warming up for war", it  continued. [passage omitted]    Wole Soyinka, the 1986 Nobel literature laureate, warned  earlier in the week that it would be senseless for the two West  African countries to go to war over a border dispute.

			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / Technology: A message about savings - The humble fax machine may be costing more than most companies think In the office, at home, in the car, in a briefcase, the facsimile machine has crept into everyday life. But few companies have any policy on the way fax machines are used, or even know how much they cost to use. 'The true bottom line of running a fax machine is never known. There is no centralised control whatsoever in many companies,' says Meredith Fischer, vice-president of marketing at Pitney Bowes' fax division. 'It's time to start setting fax policies,' she continues. If not, she warns, companies 'will continue to bleed money'. Companies which have set a fax policy have noted tremendous financial savings coupled with improved management control. CT Bowring, one of the UK's largest Lloyd's insurance and reinsurance brokers, installed a centralised fax switch from Comwave. Clement Lim, UK director of Marsh and McLennan Information Services, which owns CT Bowring, reports substantial savings - Pounds 500,000 over five years is a 'conservative' estimate, he says. Nor does that take into account the tremendous increase in the number of faxes sent - up from 1.2m pages a year to 2m. Although the boom years for fax equipment are over, the use of fax machines is spiralling upwards. A survey conducted by Gallup for Pitney-Bowes shows a remarkable surge over the past year. In 1991-92, Britain's top 1,000 companies reported sending an average 40 documents a day; this year, that figure was up to 93 documents. 'Unless something fundamentally changes in the way we use fax there is really no escaping that volumes will go up,' says Fischer. Fischer argues that companies are slow to calculate the accumulating costs of faxed documents. She advocates analysing for each machine the number of pages received and sent and the proportion of those received on thermal paper which are then photocopied. 'If you don't go through this process you don't know what you're spending. The numbers get so huge, everybody laughs at you.' At the most basic level, there is the decision about whether to swap cheaper thermal fax machines for machines which use photocopier paper. Recessionary times have forced down the price of plain paper faxes to around Pounds 2,000, scarcely more than thermal machines. Savings can be made by switching to plain paper ones 'in the right application', says Andrew James, consultant at BIS Strategic Decision - that is, where lots of faxes need to be photocopied if a thermal fax machine is used. Taking secretarial costs and paper into account, Fischer reckons that it costs 60p to copy each document. Steve Robinson, marketing manager for fax at Rank Xerox, believes that when the 1m thermal fax machines bought in the UK over the past four years are replaced, they will be ousted by plain paper machines. Such optimism is borne out by Dataquest, the IT research consultancy. 'The middle market of the high-end thermal machines has been killed off,' says industry analyst Jeffrey Goldberg. Whereas 1992 saw the predomination of laser fax machines, which use laser printers to print out the document, Goldberg believes 1993 will be the year for inkjet fax machines, where tiny dots of ink are squirted on to the paper. Inkjet technology is cheaper than laser equipment, but each sheet received works out to be more expensive. Other types of machines can produce greater savings, even if many of those are difficult to quantify. A fax card, fitted into the back of a PC, costs about Pounds 600 but enables the user to send a fax directly from the PC. There is no need to print out the document or hover over the fax machine to ensure it is sent. Offices with larger PC networks can give users access to fax technology at their desktop. Some systems need an operator to guide each incoming fax to the correct recipient but others attach a code to the fax number to identify the individual PC. One of the basic requirements for fax switch user CT Bowring was to have a centralised number for all faxes to prevent outsiders having to learn up to 60 different ones - for marine, aviation and so on. But many additional management controls have resulted. The fax switch logs and saves all messages for two weeks, so that if a fax is mislaid a copy can be made. After two weeks all messages are copied on to optical disc and stored for 10 years. 'We have installed everything from mainframes to complicated PABXs. But the thanks and praise we got for installing the fax switch were out of all proportion,' reports Lim. The quality of the final fax, he believes, is what really impresses CT Bowring employees. Other advantages accrue. 'Fax switches cut down maintenance costs dramatically and greatly reduce the cost of consumables (paper, toner),' reports Rank Xerox's Robinson. However, for many companies the stand-alone fax is still the only answer. 'I think we're a long way from the one PC per desk scenario, and until then there will still be a need for stand-alone faxes,' points out Graham MacIntyre, fax marketing manager at Canon. However, recognising that companies need centralised control of their fax machines in order to cut costs, manufacturers are looking at ways of controlling the desk-top machines centrally, says Keith Wright, national fax sales manager at Panasonic Business Systems. Within the next 18 months, electronic wizardry will be available to filter out all outgoing faxes to popular locations - from the London office of a big corporation to the New York office, for example. They will then be stored and sent at off-peak times. 'What happens at the moment is that these documents are sent at peak times and there's no one there to see them anyway,' says Wright. As well as using off-peak transmission times this service would cut down the length of the call because the 'handshake', which takes up valuable time at the beginning and the end of a call, would only be transmitted once. The calls could also be routed via cheaper data lines, or faxes could be sent via another office - from London to San Francisco via New York - if cheaper lines could be used. Such centralised systems would greatly reduce the need for training - for many companies training today is minimal. As Fischer puts it: 'Most of the time training is left to the person who sits nearest to the machine.'</p>

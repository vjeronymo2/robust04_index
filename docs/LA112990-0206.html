			<p><P> November 29, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WITH U.S. SALES SLUMPING, TOY MAKERS LOOK ABROAD  </P> <P> With an uncertain Christmas season under way, toy company executives said  Wednesday that they are looking for more business opportunities overseas to  offset the sluggish U.S. retail market.  </P> <P> "The outlook in international markets is brighter," John W. Amerman, chief  executive of El Segundo-based Mattel Inc., said at a toy industry conference  sponsored by the investment firm Bear, Stearns &amp; Co.  </P> <P> Executives generally agreed that their industry will feel pressure from the  sagging U.S. economy during the holiday season although strong products should  continue to sell well. Toy sales have slipped along with sales of other  merchandise as consumers, uncertain about the economy and the Middle East,  curtailed their spending in recent months.  </P> <P> "It's really a mixed question," said Alan Hassenfeld, chief executive of Hasbro  Inc.  </P> <P> While Pawtucket, R.I.-based Hasbro expects a healthy performance from its  Cabbage Patch dolls and Milton Bradley board games, "it might not be a buoyant  Christmas season," Hassenfeld said.  </P> <P> Overall, the U.S. toy industry has seen slow growth in recent years, rising  from a $12.4-billion market in 1986 to $13.4 billion last year, according to  estimates from the Toy Manufacturers of America, a trade group.  </P> <P> This year, the figure is expected to climb to $14 billion.  </P> <P> Those totals do not include video games, which were hot-selling items during  the 1980s. Nintendo of America Inc. projects that the company and its licensees  will sell about $4 billion worth of video game products this year.  </P> <P> But even Nintendo, which dominates the U.S. video game market, expects to see a  drop in sales of its hardware systems this year. The company does project  strong growth in its software game cartridges.  </P> <P> "Rumors of our demise continue to be premature," Peter T. Main, vice president  of marketing for Nintendo, said in prepared remarks at the conference.  </P> <P> Main said that as the market for his company's products matures, "software will  continue to be the critical ingredient."  </P> <P> Hassenfeld said a maturing video game market is a positive sign for makers of  board games, such as Milton Bradley.  </P> <P> Another encouraging trend is the growth in international sales, he said.  Hasbro, which does about one-third of its business abroad, expects  international sales to increase by more than 30% this year.  </P></p>

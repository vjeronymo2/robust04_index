			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / Clarke backs Major's leadership: Chancellor warns of tough Budget - Lamont launches attack on economic strategy MR KENNETH CLARKE offered unequivocal backing for Mr John Major's leadership yesterday after keeping open the option of tax increases in his November Budget. As Mr Major prepared for the most important speech of his three-year premiership at the end of the Conservatives' Blackpool conference today, Mr Clarke dismissed speculation that he is poised on the threshold of 10 Downing Street. The chancellor declared: 'Any enemy of John Major is an enemy of mine. Any enemy of John Major is an enemy of the Conservative party.' Mr Major managed yesterday to shrug off the appearance on the platform of his predecessor, Lady Thatcher. He is now left with an opportunity to start rebuilding his authority in his closing speech this afternoon. Lady Thatcher has dominated headlines this week with criticism of her successor apparently extracted from her forthcoming memoirs, but her entrance to Blackpool's Empress Ballroom was eclipsed by the return of Mr Michael Heseltine after his recent heart attack. With Mr Clarke warning of a tough Budget and dissident Tory MPs threatening to rebel against any further tax increases, few of the prime minister's cabinet colleagues judged the threat to his leadership had disappeared. The left-right struggle within the cabinet resurfaced again last night in sharply contrasting speeches from Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, and Mr Michael Portillo, the chief secretary to the Treasury. Mr Hurd called on the Conservatives to avoid an ideological assault on the public sector but Mr Portillo called for an ever diminishing role for the state. In a robust but less than inspirational performance, Mr Clarke hinted that value added tax on domestic fuel could be imposed at the full 17.5 per cent from next April. The present plan is for implementation in two stages - at 8 per cent in 1994 and 17.5 per cent in 1995. He delivered a relatively upbeat assessment of prospects for sustaining economic recovery, and said the priority was to curb public borrowing: 'The Conservative party is the party of sound money or it is nothing.' He added that it had been a mistake to phase in VAT on fuel rather than impose it immediately. But the chancellor's confident tone, bolstered by the failure of party activists to launch a concerted assault on the tax, was challenged by a renewed attack on his economic strategy by Mr Norman Lamont. The former chancellor warned that tax increases beyond those he had announced in March would lose the Conservatives the next election. He said that Mr Clarke should instead raise another Pounds 5bn through a 2 per cent cut in public spending. His remarks drew a sharp response from Mr Clarke who said that Mr Lamont had presided over a relatively lax spending round after the 1992 election. The threat that the political row over VAT on fuel might explode again was reinforced by a ministerial row over plans to compensate the low-paid for higher heating charges. Senior ministers said Mr Clarke had rejected a demand from Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, that the compensation should extend to people not reliant on income support. Despite earlier hints that those with incomes and savings just above that level might be compensated through housing and council tax benefit, Mr Clarke said it was 'extremely difficult' to compensate that group. He stressed that his first objective was to rein in the government's borrowing through a planned freeze in real terms on public spending.

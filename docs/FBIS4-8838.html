			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus by Martin Danes; </F> place and date not given: "Intermediate Steps Toward European  Union Membership Should Be Economic"]    [Text] [Danes] Hungary formally applied to join the  European Union [EU] a few days ago. Poland followed Hungary's  suit on Friday [8 April]. Why is the Czech Republic not  planning to take such a step? The results of economic  transformation in the Czech Republic are comparable, to say the  least, with the results of these two countries....    [Klaus] I know well that there is no opportunity,  possibility, or room in the EU today to deal seriously with  those applications. In my opinion, these applications will  simply lie around. The Community has made it repeatedly clear  that the very first possibility to even start considering such a  move would be after the EU's general conference in 1996.  Therefore, I see no reason for us to engage in some hasty  activities precisely at this moment.    [Danes] One of the arguments used by Hungarian politicians  [for applying now] is that they are interested in so-called  partial membership, the possible establishment of which is  indicated by some voices coming from the EU. Such partial  membership should include only the political dimension. What is  your view regarding the issue of partial membership?    [Klaus] I repeat that, in contrast to some other  politicians, including Czech politicians, I am in favor of some  intermediary steps leading to membership. I believe that a  certain vacuum between associate membership and full membership  will have to be filled by some new initiatives. Nevertheless, I  do not share the view appearing in those proposals that these  initiatives should be political and security-oriented first and  only then economic. I think, in fact, that it should be  precisely the other way around.    [Danes] The first round of the second wave of coupon  privatization begins on Monday [11 April]. Although no dates  have been fixed thus far, do you think that the whole process,  up to the issuance of shares to the participants, will be  shorter than in the case of the first wave?    [Klaus] I think so. All participants have become trained in  some practices, and even the method of calculation, the  algorithms, the manner of issuance of shares, and the like have  changed somewhat. I therefore believe that the whole process  could be cut short. Although I am not going to argue about  hours, days, or weeks, I am convinced that everything should be  definitely over before this year is out.</p>

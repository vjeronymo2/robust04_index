			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Press Pocket" column: "No Confederation"] </F>   [Text] President Kim Yong-sam has said that national  reunification should not be realized under a confederalized  system. He said it was a grave fallacy to think of confederation  as the formula for national reunification. He made the remarks  after receiving a briefing on the operation of a fighter wing on  Friday as if to clamp down on the emerging argument in favor of  a confederational system as a form of national reunification.  He said he cannot consent to the people thinking of a  confederation system out of an emotional yearning for national  reunification. "We should seek a viable and sustainable formula  for national reunification, he said.    Kim's remarks appear to be aimed at Kim Tae-chung, who said  upon arrival here from his tour of the United States the  previous day that people should be given the right to freely  debate the national reunification issue, proposing a referendum  on desirable unification formula. Kim Tae-chung has opted for a  confederation system as a means of eventual national  reunification. Meanwhile, North Korea has persistently held on  to the confederation system for unification.</p>

			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options trading POLITICAL uncertainty prompted volatile trading which saw the March contract slip back in a highly nervous FT-SE futures market, writes Christopher Price. March opened down at 2,471, but hesitant buying squeezed it higher, the contract reaching 2,483 by mid-morning, which turned out to be the high point of the day. Weak short sterling and gilt markets prompted further nervousness, and March began to drift downwards, although trading remained thin. The downward trend accelerated in the late afternoon as independent traders sold their long positions, joined by a number of institutions. March found support at the 2,458 level and recovered slightly to close at 2,460, down 29 on the previous session and at a discount of around 8 points to its 4-point fair value premium and at a discount to the underlying market. Turnover was a low 5,126 lots. There was also thin volume in the LTOM, with just 25,000 lots traded. Midland Bank was the favourite, trading 2,910 contracts, although it and the other top traded stocks - Sears, Amstrad and Wellcome  - reached their contract expiry date and traders closed out their positions</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Kamal Nayan Kabra, professor in the Indian </F> Institute of Public Administration: "GATT and India: The other  Face"; first paragraph THE HINDU comment]    [Text] "The sacrifices imposed on India through the GATT  are but a component of the reckless, fundamentalist drive to  implement the structural adjustment programme."    Nations do not enter into treaties and agreements,  multilaterally or bilaterally, on the basis simply of the  calculus of gain or loss of so many rupees or dollars.  Certainly, questions of national sovereignty, equality of  participation in decision-making processes, status, impact on  national psyche, signals emanating from the process and content  of the negotiations, etc., are no less relevant. But much the  more basic are the questions of national priorities, development  policies, domestic power balance and the way we place and view  ourselves in the comity of nations. These factors matter since  the recent GATT agreement among 117 nations and the proposed  setting up of a World Trade Organisation (WTO) are going to have  a far-reaching impact on the emergent world order.    What kind of world order the GATT agreement would lead to?  An  indication of it may be had from the reported statement of the  U.S. President claiming success through the GATT agreement for  the continued leadership (read, hegemony) of the world economy  for his country.    This seems to be no empty boast. The G.7 and the United  States have asserted their one-up-manship at every step: the  determination of the agenda, the process of negotiations, the  Draft Final Act and the final Act. A quick reflection would make  it clear that our sins of commission and omission have  contributed to this outcome in no small measure.    Let us see how. The Third World countries have a majority in  that GATT which works on the basis of 'one country one vote' and  without veto power with any country. The agreement is hammered  out through a protracted process of negotiations providing  opportunities for detailed home work, marshalling of theoretical  and empirical arguments, articulation of individual country and  group interests, preparation of alternative scenarios based on  different negotiating stances, with ample time for pre-and-post  agreement contingency plans in order to be able to acquire the  necessary strength to back up one's negotiating minimum and  maximal positions mobilisation of both domestic and  international public opinion and preparation of the country to  take up the gauntlet in case extra-economic or extra-trade  pressures are being brought to bear on the negotiations process  for tilting the scales against our interests. Since there have  been slips up throughout this process, little wonder one throws  up one's hands in despair at the end and bemoans or takes  shelter behind the facade of no-availability of any option but  to give in.    Since trade policy has significant linkages with all the  real and financial sphere policies, our capacity to strike a  good bargain would depend on our overall policy regime which  spell out our options and the capacity to withstand pressures.  If we are critically dependent on external finance, technology,  supplies of essential commodities and have downplayed the role  of internal articulation and mobilisation as the kingpins of our  development, little wonder we make ourselves easy prey to  armstwisting. Thus invoking of the TINA (there is no  alternative) is an acknowledgement of the extent to which  autonomous national development linked with the forces of social  justice has been neglected and bungled. Our negotiating  positions are essentially a reflection of the relative weight of  various domestic stakeholders, say, for instance, the relative  balance between import and export dependent sections, and those  whose economic fortunes depend but marginally on the factors and  forces beyond our boundaries. The domestic political economy of  our stand on GATT derives from a further differentiation among  the divergent interests of our extant and potential partners in  the external economic area, particularly those whose appetite  for foreign exchange and the craze for the "phoren" have made  export earnings such a great "national" cause that no price  seems too high for these. And the price of treating exports as  an overriding objective includes diversion of domestic supplies  causing rampant malnutrition, larger allocation for export  production with high import and capital intensity causing  unemployment, unrequited income transfers in favour of our  trading partners via worsening terms of trade and depreciating  rupee, environmental degradation, and concentration of benefits  from such trade in the hands of a few lakh exporters and  importers. Judging further on the basis of official admission  that in signing the GATT agreement we have made the best of a  bad bargain, let us examine some of the implications of the  acceptance of the final act.    The basic thrust of GATT agreement is to assure market  access  to goods by bringing down and/or eliminating tariffs, something  which had been agreed upon by both the developed and the  developing countries. It is claimed that this would spur a big  spurt in world trade from which countries like India too would  benefit. As a price for it the developing countries have given  an undertaking not to raise the tariffs, in future also. In case  of balance of payment difficulties, they have to use  quantitative restrictions only.    It is too mechanical to believe that across the board lower  tariffs and by all the 117 countries granting each other MFN  status (reduced to some extent to a farce by the nations joining  customs union and free trade areas like the European Community  and NAFTA) would really lead to a higher volume of world trade  notwithstanding continued recession, and forecast of global  slowdown. Similarly naive is the view that countries like India  would be able to share in this presumed growth on account of  tariffs lowered by everyone, and thus at least denying us any  comparative price advantage. One has just to recall the results  of our past devaluations as also the role of domestic factors  like fluctuating farm output, slow industrial growth, growing  import-intensity of our exports, foreign exchange and  infrastructure constraints, super profitability of domestic  sales, entry of MNCs in export goods with their penchant for  selling in the host country, etc., to appreciate the amount of  make-believe involved in such a reckoning.    But undertaking a commitment to lower tariffs and not to  raise them in future has many other non-trade related grave  implications. It restricts our domestic fiscal and investment  policy options in so far as we cannot raise excise duties,  particularly on traded goods, without disturbing the balance  between make or buy option. If we did raise excise duties for  various reasons like curbing inflation, reducing consumption  inequities, discouraging consumption of non-merit goods,  financing development, etc., beyond the point disrupting their  parity with customs duties, it would amount to discrimination  against domestic production. But by remaining within the range  prescribed by the GATT- given customs duties, we cripple our  fiscal and public investment policy. This is how the GATT gnaws  away at our sovereignty and nationally determined path of  development. It is on account of such ceilings on excise duties  implicit in the GATT terms that our business classes are  plumping for the GATT agreement.    Take another serious implication. With the opening of trade  in farm products and with market pull of OECD countries' higher  incomes for our exotic food, fruits, flowers and the lure of  higher profits among our rich and big landlord farmers, our  scarce land and other farm inputs would get allocated to crops  other than those which are needed and can be afforded by  millions of poor Indians. To assume that the foreign exchange  thus earned could be allotted for importing essential foodgrains  is an instance of stoneheadedness: the pull of highly skewed  domestic income distribution rules out any meaningful  possibility of this kind.    The policy predilections manifested in our overwilling  acceptance of the GATT agreement have to be seen in the context  of the use of the marginal external economic sector to set the  tone, terms and tenor of the overall economic policy regime (a  la internationalisation, marketisation, privatisation, etc.).  Thus, the sacrifices imposed on us through the GATT are but a  component of the heavy cost of the reckless, fundamentalist  drive to implement the structural adjustment programme. Let it  be remembered that these costs are grossly unjustly distributed  among our domestic interests and have to be borne for long by  our future generations as well. Two NRI economists commissioned  by the Finance Ministry to endorse and endear the liberalisation  drive must be appreciated for their frank advice that GATT terms  have to be accepted in order to further the cause of  liberalisation or what they called, "economic reforms."</p>

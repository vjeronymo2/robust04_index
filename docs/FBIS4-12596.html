			<p>BFN     [Text] Here is a report just in. A Jewish woman was  stabbed a short while ago while strolling on the promenade in  East Jerusalem's Armon Hanetziv neighborhood. Our correspondent  Uri Kohen-Aharonov was told that the assailant, who fled, was an  Arab. A Magen David Adom ambulance evacuated the young woman,  who was wounded in the stomach, to Hadassah-'En Kerem Hospital.</p>

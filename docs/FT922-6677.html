			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Brazil set to lift orange juice exports by 37.5% EXPORTS of Brazilian orange juice and derivatives should reach Dollars 1.4bn for the 1991-92 harvest season, based on preliminary figures for the first 10 months of the July-June cycle, according to the Association of Brazilian Citrus Exporters (Abicitrus). That figure would represent a 37.5 per cent increase over the previous season's receipts. Through the end of April, Brazilian exports of 798,000 tonnes had generated sales of Dollars 1.2bn. Overall export receipts for 1990-91 were Dollars 1.0bn. Better prices and sales of stocks are responsible for the improvement, said Mr Ademerval Garcia, Abicitrus president. Production, he said, is about the same as last season. The average price in 1991 was Dollars 900 per tonne/fob. This year, the average is Dollars 1,186 per tonne/fob. Carry over last season was 336,000 tonnes, compared to 157,000 this season. Brazilian exporters are eyeing Japan with more interest, since it eliminated its import quotas for orange juice. Currently, 4 per cent of Brazilian exports are shipped to Japan, compared to 48.5 per cent to the European Community.</p>

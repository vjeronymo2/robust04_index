			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Waters in demand Water issues held up well as Credit Lyonnais Laing highlighted their attractions. Analyst Mr Robert Giles said that on Monday afternoon the water shares had moved to a yield relative of 150, a level not seen since the general election. He also pointed out that index-linked gilts, which the utilities tend to track, had picked up. Mr Giles pinpointed Yorkshire, 11 higher at 536p after 547p, Severn Trent, unchanged at 556p after 572p, and Anglian 11 firmer at 515p, as his prime selections. Property shares wilted in the weak market, undermined further by disappointing end-December results from Wates City of London Properties. Analysts said the slight increase in the net asset value to 72.8p was well below market expectations of between 75p and 105p, although this was tempered by the fact that much of the upward valuations in properties have been in January and February. Mr Graham Stanley at Goldman Sachs said: 'The recent shake-out among property stocks has highlighted some areas of value for investors. But with the uncertainties in the bond market, we remain cautious in the short term.' Among the leading stocks, British Land fell 21 to 414p, MEPC 17 to 488p and Land Securities 17 to 703p. A trade press report that Air France might listen to offers for its Meridien hotel chain prompted speculation in the market that Forte may be one interested party. The UK group, still smarting from its recent failure to land the Italian Ciga chain, is known to be keen to expand its international portfolio. Forte eased a penny to 268p. Talk over Forte's intentions towards the Savoy Group saw the latter move up 37 to 1075p. Standard Chartered was the pick of an uncertain banking sector, with the shares building on Monday's strong performance and moving 16 higher to 1180p, partly reflecting increasing optimism over this morning's preliminary figures, and the chances that the numbers could be accompanied by a share split. Also helping sentiment in stocks heavily exposed to Hong Kong and the Far East was a story that Morgan Stanley, the US investment bank, which has triggered big moves in the Hang Seng index over the past year or so, was preparing to increase its weighting in the Hong Kong market. High street banks also held up well against the overall market, with some leading brokers said to be preparing the case that the banks sector is ripe for a rerating after its recent steep decline. The weakness across financial sectors was triggered by fears of big losses in trading bonds and equities. The takeover/rights issue speculation surrounding BAT led to renewed talk of potential corporate moves in the UK composite and life sectors. Guardian Royal Exchange, up a penny at 196p, was one of only a handful of FT-SE 100 stocks to close up on the session after speculators decided it could be a prime target for attack. Graham Group, the builders merchants hived off by BTR, made a scintillating market debut. Offered for sale at 183p, Graham opened at 197p, marginally above most expectations, and touched 203 1/2 p before easing to 202p by the close. Volume reached 34m shares, easily the heaviest individual turnover in the market. Chemicals group Laporte was firmer after announcing full-year profits of Pounds 107.4m, up from Pounds 86.6m last time. But the stock ticked back with the market to end 20 down at 794p on uninspired turnover. Hoare Govett raised its recommendation from hold to buy. Reuters lost much of Monday's gain, sliding 56 to 2103p. Results at the high end of some expectations sent marketing services group WPP up 2 to 125p. SG Warburg forecast that WPP would 'exhibit 25 per cent average eps growth between 1992 and 1996'. News of losses at USAir, in which British Airways has a 24.6 per cent stake, left shares in the UK carrier off 11 at 419p after trade of 6.3m. Shares in Williams Holdings put on 8 at 409p, with Morgan Stanley said to have had a big buyer of the stock.</p>

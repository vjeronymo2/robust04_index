			<p>920203 FT  03 FEB 92 / Lenders see drop in mortgage arrears A FALL in the number of mortgage arrears and of house repossessions has been well under way since the third quarter of last year, according to the Council of Mortgage Lenders, David Barchard writes. A group of mortgage lenders met the council last week and was given preliminary details of the numbers of repossessions last year. The figures are to be formally announced on Thursday next week. Although two lenders have yet to submit their final figures, it seems clear that the total repossessions last year were well below the 85,000 originally forecast. The final total could be about 80,000. Lenders have also been told that the number of accounts between three and six months in arrears began to fall sharply from last autumn.</p>

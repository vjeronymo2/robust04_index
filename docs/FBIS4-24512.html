			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Y. C. Tsai] </F>   [Text] Taipei, May 28 (CNA) -- Foreign investors are  working to make inroads into the peripheral businesses for the  air transportation industry in Taiwan, trade sources said  Saturday [28 May].    The sources made the remark after the ministry of economic  affairs approved an investment plan by Hong Kong's Alde Burgh  Ltd. to open a flight kitchen company here. Alde Burgh is an  affiliated firm of the Swire Group, a business conglomerate in  the British colony.    The project calls for a total investment of NT [new Taiwan)0  $2.27 billion (US$84.07 million), half of which will come from a  bank loan.    This is the second such project to get the green light here.  Earlier this month, the ministry approved a similar investment  plan by an American company.    The sources forecast that a growing number of foreign  enterprises will join domestic air freight peripheral businesses  as Taiwan aims to become an Asia-Pacific air transportation  center.    Moreover, they pointed out, Lockheed Aircraft Corp. of the  United States has decided to increase investment in its Taiwan  subsidiary by NT$610 million (US$22.59 million) to open a  production as well as repair and maintenance center for flight  control systems.    The capital increment plan has already been approved by the  ministry, they added.</p>

			<p><P> March 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SKIES OF WINTER NIGHTS  </P> <P> My bed has four white rats for its feet.  </P> <P> I walk out into the night sky, as if into a cage  </P> <P> then skate out over the heavens.  </P> <P> So clear, so resonant,  </P> <P> the skies of winter nights,  </P> <P> more expansive, emptier than a deserted scrapyard.  </P> <P> Snowflakes are drunken moths  </P> <P> and the villages dotted here and there  </P> <P> are wine barrels buried in the snow.  </P> <P> 'Who will come and clasp me round the neck?'  </P> <P> I can hear a horse  </P> <P> murmuring as it trots.  </P> <P> 'Clip, clip,' a huge pair of shears has begun to work.  </P> <P> From within a great cavern, the stars all begin to rise  </P> <P> and billowing waves are spied in the horse's eyes.  </P> <P> Ah, I feel so good.  </P> <P> As if I was running my hands all the way down  </P> <P> the smooth, glistening spine of a whale.  </P> <P> I am searching for the city where I live.  </P> <P> I am searching for my beloved,  </P> <P> there on the pedals of my bicycle, those two restless  </P> <P> bananas.  </P> <P> Let the wood  </P> <P> rest in the timberyard and get on with its nightmare.  </P> <P> Let the new moon lying on the ash-coloured desert  </P> <P> get on and sharpen its sickle.  </P> <P> Not necessarily from the East:  </P> <P> I see the sun as a thread of pearls.  </P> <P> The sun is a necklace of pearls, rising in succession. . .  </P> <P> 1985  </P></p>

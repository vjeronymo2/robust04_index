			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / Britain backs Bonn UN role Britain sees a German seat on the UN Security Council as both desirable and likely, Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary, said yesterday. It was the second time in a week that Mr Hurd has voiced his approval for a more active German role on the world stage. Asked on BBC radio whether Britain would back a proposal to give Germany a permanent Security Council seat, he replied: 'Yes, indeed we would.' He added that the UK viewed German admission as a probable outcome of forthcoming debates on the UN's future structure. UK officials said London continued to link German and Japanese admission to the Council with a broader reform of the institution, in which Latin America, Africa and Asia might also demand seats. Mr Hurd told the German magazine Der Spiegel, in an interview published this week, that Britain welcomed the prospect of a more decisive role for Germany in international affairs. He said it was 'childish twaddle' to imagine that Britain might be jealous of President Bill Clinton's enthusiasm for ties with Germany.</p>

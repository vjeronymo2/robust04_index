			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 24 KYODO -- Hitachi Ltd. has developed  the world's smallest scale capable of submicron-level  measurement, using mainly conductive single-crystal silicon, the  company said Thursday [24 February]. It is the first scale  capable of absolute submicron-level calibrations, a senior  company researcher said.    The researcher, Kenichi Mizuishi, chief of Hitachi's  Advanced  Technology Development Department, said the microscale is  graduated in 0.2 microns (a 5,000th of a millimeter), and may be  used in measuring the accuracy of, for instance, scanning  electron microscopes (SEMs). SEMs are used in measuring the  line width -- 0.2 to 0.25 micron -- of circuits of a 256-megabit  memory chip believed to come into practical use at the end of  the current century.    The National Research Laboratory of Meteorology has  cooperated with Hitachi in the development of the microscale.  The development will be reported by Hitachi at a conference of  the Society of Optical Engineering to be held in the United  States starting February 28, Mizuishi said.    He said the chemical etching and laser interferometer  lithographic processes, used in the production of semiconductor  memory chips, has been employed in the development of the  microscale. Interferometer is an instrument that utilizes the  interference of waves of light for precise determinations of  distance or wavelength.    In the case of the microscale, if electron microscope  electron beams collide with the scale, it hardly causes  distortions in the scale, and the microscale is suited for  quantity production, the researcher said. He said the company  hopes to commercialize the microscale within a couple of years.</p>

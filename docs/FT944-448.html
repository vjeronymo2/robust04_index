			<p>941229 FT  29 DEC 94 / Mexican markets rebound as IMF crisis talks begin The Mexican stock market and currency rebounded yesterday as talks got under way between the government and the International Monetary Fund and other financing agencies which could lead to an emergency financial package. Mexican officials held urgent meetings in Washington to try to negotiate the support package. A US Treasury official said last night that Mexico had not drawn on nearly Dollars 7bn (Pounds 4.46bn) in currency support lines offered by the US and Canada, but he confirmed that discussions were under way on external support for Mexico. He refused to provide details. Also yesterday, doubts were surfacing about Mexico's ability to repay holders of its dollar-denominated government securities. The government, which faces a financial crisis following a sharp devaluation of the peso during the past week, is seeking funds to back a currency stabilisation plan, which it is expected to announce soon. The meetings with the IMF and other financing agencies were adjourned yesterday as an IMF mission headed for Mexico City. There were unconfirmed reports yesterday of support for the peso by the New York Federal Reserve. The spot rate for the peso rose to close at 4.975 to the dollar, compared with 5.6 at Tuesday's close when the currency had fallen 39 per cent since December 19. Helped by the strengthening peso, the Mexican stock market recovered yesterday and was up 2.67 per cent at the close. In New York, Mexican shares recovered sharply after Tuesday's falls, with Telmex up 9.93 per cent at 41 1/2 and Televisa up 7.95 per cent at 32 1/4 . The doubts about the government's ability to service debt arose after it had become clear this week that many holders of tesobonos (short-term, dollar-denominated securities issued by the government) would be unwilling to buy further securities as their existing paper matured. The central bank offered Dollars 950m in tesobonos on Tuesday but only Dollars 27.6m was purchased. About Dollars 3.5bn in tesobonos will come due in the next five weeks, as will an additional Dollars 13bn between February and June. Some 80 per cent of these bonds are held by foreign investors - many by US mutual funds. If the trend continues, the Mexican government will face further pressure on its already limited reserves. Reuter adds from Mexico City: Mexican agrarian reform minister Miguel Limon pledged yesterday to tackle a main cause of a year-old rebellion in the southern state of Chiapas by redistributing land from large ranchers to poor peasants.

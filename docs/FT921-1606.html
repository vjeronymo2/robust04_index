			<p>920324 FT  24 MAR 92 / The FT Review of Business Books (18): Charting the rise of the rural HQ THE NEW CORPORATE FRONTIER by David Heenan McGraw-Hill Pounds 15.95, 262 pages IN 1960, New York was home to the head offices of 130 out of the US's 500 biggest companies: by 1990 the number had shrunk to 43. Over the same period most other large US cities saw a similar reduction, a sign of the flight to the countryside of US business. Shifts in organisation have played a part. Much of the west's industry depends far less today than in the 1960s on large pools of manual labour. That means they can relatively easily set up in under-populated regions. Also, the entrepreneurs who were responsible for much of the 1980s economic boom in the US often preferred the space and freedom of rural areas. Hence many relatively new US companies are based in out-of-the-way places such as Portland or Boise, rather than in Chicago or Pittsburgh. In documenting this corporate shift, Heenan provides plenty of examples of how the relatively informal 'small town' ethos of the countryside-based companies can help their general business approach, such as through non-hierachial management structures and good relations with the local population. But the descriptions of the 'frontier' companies - they include Cummins Engines, the Wal-Mart store chain and an ice-cream maker called Ben &amp; Jerry's - lack depth. And while one chapter is devoted to the pitfalls of setting up in the countrywide - such as how to attract to live in these regions the lively, young professionals who often like the spice of big-city life - too much of the book reads like an advert for the companies concerned. A final point is that the research for the book was done mainly in the mid to late 1980s. It would be interesting to know how many of the companies listed (most of which are lauded for doing amazingly well commercially) are coping with recession.</p>

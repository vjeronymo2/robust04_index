(``CBOE'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II, and III below, which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> CBOE Rule 17.50, ``Imposition of Fines for Minor Rule Violations,'' authorizes the Exchange to impose a fine of up to $5,000 for minor violations of certain CBOE rules in lieu of commencing a disciplinary proceeding. The CBOE proposes to amend CBOE Rule 17.50 to extend the ``lookback period'' for determining certain sanctions, clarify appeal procedures, and limit the number of times a member may request verification of certain fines. Specifically, the Exchange proposes to amend CBOE Rule 17.50 to: (1) extend from nine to 18 months the ``lookback period'' for failure to submit accurate trade information pursuant to CBOE Rule 6.51, ``Reporting Duties;'' and (2) create an 18-month ``lookback period'' for failure to submit trade information to the price reporter pursuant to CBOE Rule 6.51. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The CBOE also proposes to amend CBOE Rule 17.50(g)(6) to provide that the maximum fine authorized under the Exchange's trading and decorum policies may be imposed for a first or second offense if warranted under the circumstances in the view of the Floor Officials Committee. In addition, the CBOE proposes to amend Interpretation and Policy .03 to Exchange Rule 17.50 to impose a cap on the number of transactions during a particular month for which a member fined more than twice in a 18-month period for failure to submit accurate trade information or failure to submit trade information to the price reporter may request verification of the fine. Under the amended interpretation, a member fined more than twice in an 18-month period may request verification of the greater of 50 transactions during a month or 10% of the number of transactions deemed not to be in compliance with CBOE Rule 6.51. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Moreover, the CBOE proposes to amend CBOE Rule 17.50 to (1) clarify the appeal procedures for fines imposed for trading conduct and decorum violations; (2) allow waiver of the forum fee for appeals of fines imposed pursuant to CBOE Rule 17.50 if a fine is reduced on appeal; and (3) make the procedures applicable to requests by the Exchange's Board of Directors (``Board'') for review by the Board of determinations rendered under CBOE Rule 17.50 consistent with the procedures applicable to similar Board requests for review under CBOE Rule 19.5, ``Review.'' Finally, the proposal makes certain nonsubstantive editorial changes to clarify CBOE Rule 17.50. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The text of the proposal is available at the Office of the Secretary, CBOE, and at the Commission. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II.

The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> CBOE Rule 17.50 authorizes the Exchange to impose a fine, not to exceed $5,000, for minor violations of certain CBOE rules in lieu of commencing a disciplinary proceeding. The purpose of the proposal is to revise CBOE Rule 17.50 to (1) extend from nine to 18 months the ``lookback period'' for failure to submit accurate trade information; (2) establish an 18-month ``lookback period'' for failure to submit trade information to the price reporter; (3) impose a cap on the number of transactions during a particular month for which a member fined more than twice in an 18-month period for failure to submit accurate trade information or failure to submit trade information to the price reporter may request verification; (4) clarify the appeal procedures for fines imposed for trading conduct and decorum violations; (5) allow waiver of the forum fee for appeals of fines imposed pursuant to CBOE Rule 17.50 if a fine is reduced on appeal; and (6) make the procedures applicable to requests by the Exchange's Board for review by the Board of determinations rendered under CBOE Rule 17.50 consistent with the procedures applicable to similar Board requests for review under CBOE Rule 19.5. In addition, the proposal makes certain editorial changes to clarify CBOE Rule 17.50 without affecting its substance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

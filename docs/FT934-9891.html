			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / Rabin in call to EC over exports ISRAEL'S prime minister, Mr Yitzhak Rabin, launched a scathing attack on the EC yesterday, demanding better access for Israeli exports to European markets and more vigorous support for the peace process. 'The unjustified discrimination against Israel by the EC cannot be tolerated any longer,' he said. 'We do not need sympathy, we need deeds and acts to support those who have taken risks for peace'. Speaking to the Institute for European Studies at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, Mr Rabin contrasted the economic and political attitudes of the EC with those of the US. While the US provided generous aid and its trade with Israel was roughly in balance, the EC was running a trade surplus of about Dollars 5bn (Pounds 3.3bn). He did not expect the EC to match the US, but at least it should give Israel the chance to compete. 'Even after a year of talks with the EC, we are still not allowed to begin formal negotiations,' he complained. Bilateral talks on replacing the obsolete 1975 free trade agreement are expected to be completed next year and will concentrate on Israel's demands for improved access for agricultural and high-technology products. The Israeli leader also wanted a more emphatic European stance against the continuing Arab boycott. 'We do not look to Europe as we do to the US, but we do at least ask them to do the minimum,' he said. This meant putting real pressure on the Arab League to call off the boycott of Israel, and also doing more to mute Arab criticism of the peace deal with the PLO. Mr Rabin stressed the calculated risks that Israel was taking for peace, and thanked Egypt for providing a venue in Cairo yesterday for the resumption of talks between the PLO and Israel. The negotiations, which are due to be completed by December 13, were broken off last week by the Palestinians in protest at Israel's proposals for a redeployment of troops in the Gaza Strip and West Bank town of Jericho. Defending the Israeli proposals, Mr Rabin said that, if they were implemented, 90 per cent of Palestinians in the Gaza strip would not see an Israeli soldier from sunrise to sunset. The latest round of talks are being held at a secret venue in Cairo in order to avoid media attention.</p>

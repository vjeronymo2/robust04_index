			<p><P> February 13, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KYOKO INA, JAPAN'S JUNIOR CHAMPION IN 1987, TAKES U.S. JUNIOR GIRLS' TITLE  </P> <P> It was Japanese-American week at the U.S. figure skating championships. After  Kristi Yamaguchi finished second in the women's individual competition and  first in pairs on the senior level, Kyoko Ina won the junior girls'  championship Sunday at the Baltimore Arena.  </P> <P> That gives Ina, 16, of Englewood Cliffs, N.J., junior championships in two  hemispheres. She was Japan's junior champion in 1987.  </P> <P> But after she finished fourth in juniors the next year in Japan, officials  there advised her that she might have an easier time in the United States. At  the 1988 world junior championships, Japanese skaters finished second and third  behind Yamaguchi. In the 1989 championships, a Japanese skater finished second  to Jessica Mills, who trains in Harbor City.  </P> <P> Ina said Sunday that she would rather compete in the United States. The  daughter of a Japanese costume jewelry manufacturer who is in the import-export  business in New York, Ina was born in Tokyo and has dual citizenship. But she  has lived in the United States since she was 6 months old.  </P> <P> The reason she competed in Japan in the first place was because her mother, a  former member of the Japanese national swimming team, encouraged her. Her  grandfather was an Olympian in track and field for Japan.  </P> <P> "I felt like an outsider when I went back to Japan," said Ina, who speaks only  a few words of Japanese. "They brushed me off."  </P> <P> Ina won the championship Sunday over a pair of 14-year-olds, runner-up Mills  and third-place Tisha Walker of Thousand Oaks. All three earned berths in the  1990 world junior championships at Colorado Springs, Colo.  </P> <P> Natasha Kuchiki of Canoga Park finished 12th. RANDY HARVEY  </P></p>

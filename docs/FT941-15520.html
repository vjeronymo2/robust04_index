			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / Observer: Setting examples Nice to see that some of those most responsible for fouling the English language - US academics - are doing their bit to clean up the mess. The Chicago Tribune tells us that staff at Lake Superior State University have published their annual list of solecisms. The exercise is conducted in order to tidy up language by banishing words and expressions that have been misused, overused or generally proven useless. First on the hit-list is 'politically correct'. The phrase 'mother of. . . ' also gets short shrift. 'Paradigm' is also out - 'while it is all the buzz among jargon makers in Washington, the rest of the country hasn't yet figured out what it is supposed to mean'. Which surely makes it an ideal word for politicians everywhere?</p>

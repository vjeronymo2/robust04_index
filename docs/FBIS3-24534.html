The results showed that under appropriate  combinatons of expression vector and host HIL3 yields approached  30-40% of total cell protein. Such optimal combinations  were  represented by E. coli HB101 and pTEIL3, and E. coli TG1 and  pTOTE2L3. Precipitation, ultrafiltration and purification via  HPLC provided IL3 preparations with a purity of &gt;  98%  and a  specific activities on the order of 5 x 10E6 U/mg.

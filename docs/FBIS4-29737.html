			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 20 KYODO -- The Japan-U.S. Economic  Council on Monday [20 June] formally elected Yotaro Kobayashi,  chairman of Fuji Xerox Co., as the new council chief, council  officials said Monday.    Kobayashi replaces Akio Morita, the former chairman of Sony  Corp. who is currently undergoing medical treatment after  suffering a cerebral hemorrhage late last year, the officials  said.    The Council, which is made up of influential Japanese  business leaders, is a preparatory organization for the annual  Japan-U.S. business conference which holds debates on trade and  economic problems between the two countries. The three-day  conference will be held in Tokyo from July 10.    Kobayashi told a press conference after the meeting that the  Council will create objective standards by which to gauge the  progress of market-opening measures, and will jointly establish  a working group for discussions on deregulation by both  countries at the next conference.</p>

			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / US recovery doubt as sales plunge A PLUNGE in US retail sales last month has revived pessimism about the strength of the country's economic recovery and sharpened President Bill Clinton's arguments in favour of the Dollars 16bn (Pounds 10.5bn) spending stimulus he has so far been unable to push through Congress. The Commerce Department said retail sales dropped 1 per cent in March and revised earlier estimates of February sales to a fall of 0.3 per cent, instead of the 0.3 per cent rise originally announced. The figures added to pressure on the dollar on the foreign exchange markets. In London, the US currency lost ground across the board, dropping to DM1.5790 from DM1.607 before the Easter break on Thursday. In late New York trading, it was little changed at DM1.57935. Some of last month's fall in sales could be attributed to the effects of heavy snowstorms along much of the east coast, which depressed sales of building materials, clothing and petrol. But Mr Ron Brown, the commerce secretary, said the two consecutive months of decline provided 'compelling evidence that recovery is at risk unless decisive action is taken when Congress returns next week'. All sectors except drugstores showed a decline, with furniture stores down 2.3 per cent and department stores down 2.5 per cent. March sales still stood 4.4 per cent higher than a year ago at an estimated Dollars 166.9bn, but economists said recent surveys of consumer confidence, such as the Conference Board indicator, have shown a much grimmer outlook for consumer spending after a brief surge in the wake of Mr Clinton's election last November. The stimulus bill, which the Clinton administration claims will create 500,000 jobs, has been blocked in the Senate by a united Republican opposition, which has denied the administration the three fifths majority it needs to end debate and force a vote. Mr Clinton has embarked on a campaign of harsh public criticism of the Republicans - on Monday, pointing to 25,000 children taking part in an Easter egg race on the White House lawn, he suggested that the young were suffering because of the delay. He further irritated Senator Robert Dole, Republican leader, by accusing senators of romping in their private swimming pool on Capitol Hill while denying funds for pools in inner cities. The administration is also trying to win support from Republican mayors, several of whom have backed the spending plan. Currencies, Page 33 World stocks, Page 39</p>

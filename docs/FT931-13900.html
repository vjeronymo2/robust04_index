			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Tories at odds over media standards AN ATTACK on successive Tory governments for allowing even lower standards by 'the worst newspapers in the world', while 'vandalising' the best in television, was launched yesterday by Lord Gilmour, a former Tory cabinet minister. He criticised ministers for not introducing a Freedom of Information Act and for not protecting television. Lord Gilmour, formerly Sir Ian Gilmour, also said the government should change its mind and back statutory curbs as set out in the Calcutt report. Meanwhile, Mr Kenneth Baker, another former Tory cabinet minister, used a speech to a Commons press gallery lunch to say that statutory control of the press would be 'absurd'. Though some 'adjustment' to laws was needed, that would still leave a wide area where press coverage would depend on a code of behaviour, he said.</p>

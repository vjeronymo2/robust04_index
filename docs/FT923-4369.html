			<p>920907 FT  07 SEP 92 / International Company News: Thai Air director faces inquiry THE MAN chosen by Thailand's civilian government as the preferred next president of Thai Airways International (Thai), the listed national airline is facing an investigation for corruption and mismanagement, officials in Bangkok announced at the weekend. The allegations against Mr Chatrachai Bunya-Ananta, executive vice-president, were interpreted as an attempt by air force officers to discredit their rivals in the airline's management team and damage Mr Chatrachai's chances. The interim government has moved quickly to reduce military influence and corruption in business since it was appointed in June, but its efforts to change Thai Airways' articles of association (which give the air force automatic control of the board) before the general election on September 13 have met stiff resistance. The confrontation, focusing on the need for professional management of such a large international company, is expected to come to a head today at an extraordinary shareholders' meeting. Mr Chatrachai will be investigated by the Counter-Corruption Commission because the CCC received a 233-page document suggesting, among other allegations, that he is involved with two transport companies which compete with Thai Airways and has profited from ticket sales and a printing contract for the in-flight magazine. Mr Chatrachai, who has worked for Thai Airways for more than 20 years, said he was innocent and welcomed the chance to clear his name. 'It's good because we can settle the matter once and for all,' he was quoted as saying. Thai Airways' shares have moved erratically recently with foreign and local investors showing enthusiasm for the company when the civilian government seemed to have the upper hand and pessimism when the air force appeared to be winning. Last week, Thai Airways closed at baht 60.5 (Dollars 2.40), just above its initial public offering price. The finance ministry holds 93 per cent of the shares - only 7 per cent have so far been sold to the public - but has found it difficult to impose the government's will on the recalcitrant air force officers who have made the company their fiefdom.</p>

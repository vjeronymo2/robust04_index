			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading PROFIT-TAKING, as hopes of a cut in interest rates in the short term faded, led to a poor day in the derivatives, writes Joel Kibazo. In stock index futures, trading in the March contract on the FT-SE 100 contract began at 2,795. Dwindling hopes of an interest rate cut led to an early sell-off which saw the contract dip to 2,786 by mid morning. It recovered later and was trading around 2,801 by lunchtime. However, with other European markets having a weak day, and alongside a dull performance in the fixed interest markets, there was little in the way of real enthusiasm for March. In the afternoon, sellers of the contract ahead of Wednesday's treasury gilts auction returned to the fore. At the day's low, reached around 3pm, March was trading at 2,772. The firmness on Wall Street helped it regain some momentum and it closed at 2,780, down 23 on the previous session and around 2 points above its estimated fair value premium of about 9. Turnover at 6,246 was poor. Traded options business was dull with volume reaching only 21,384 lots, down from 37,990 on Friday. The FT-SE 100 option saw 6,406 lots traded and the Euro-FTSE 100 index 614 lots. Among stock options, British Steel was the most active with a total of 2,474 lots and was followed by Asda at 1,834 and Sainsbury at 1,202 contracts.</p>

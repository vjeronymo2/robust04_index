			<p>921116 FT  16 NOV 92 / Leaked report revives Gatt dispute A DOCUMENT leaked to a French newspaper from an alleged European Commission source yesterday revived the bitter dispute over EC concessions to the US on world trade three days before the resumption of crucial talks in Washington. The document contains figures which purport to prove that Mr Ray MacSharry, EC agriculture commissioner, is going beyond the price and production cuts agreed under reforms of the Common Agricultural Policy in his farm trade negotiations with the US. An official close to Mr MacSharry said it looked like a French attempt to undermine the negotiations. These 'are certainly not official figures', he said, adding: 'It's a fabrication.' The leak comes just as the internal Commission battle over the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and European agriculture appeared to have ended. Mr MacSharry returned as negotiator last Tuesday having angrily resigned, accusing Mr Jacques Delors, the Commission president, of undermining the negotiations and siding with his native France. EC-US talks aimed at settling their oilseeds row and agreeing farm subsidy cuts under the Uruguay Round of the Gatt talks resume on Wednesday night in Washington. The leaked document, carried by the Paris newspaper, Liberation, confirms that the battleground will remain whether any Gatt deal brought back from Washington is compatible with the CAP reform. It claims that the 10m-tonne ceiling on production of oilseeds being offered to the US by Mr MacSharry would require 21 per cent of land to be taken out of production, against the 15 per cent 'set-aside' agreed now. If the US demand for an EC output ceiling of 9m tonnes were accepted, idle land could reach 38 per cent, the document maintains. However, the document forecasts oilseeds output this year of 12.5m tonnes, sharply at variance with official Commission forecasts of 11.4m tonnes. Mr MacSharry's department maintains that what the Commission is offering in the Gatt talks is well within CAP output and subsidised export projections on cereals, beef and dairy produce. These projections were thrashed out by member states - including France - to fix a budget for the new CAP. However, France, under pressure from its farmers, has argued against a Gatt deal on the terms sought by the EC. Paris claims farmers will be faced with cuts beyond those agreed this year in the CAP reform. Its main objection is that the 24 per cent cut in the volume of subsidised food exports prescribed by Gatt will hit its big farm trade surplus. France is expected to go on the offensive when EC farm ministers meet today, having last week lost its battle to get the Community to prepare for a trade war with the US. Washington has announced Dollars 300m in punitive tariffs from December 5 on EC food exports as a sanction on Community oilseeds subsidies, twice condemned by the Gatt.</p>

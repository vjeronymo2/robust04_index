			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / Deep-freeze for Canada's ice hockey: A salary dispute which has brought the sport to a halt For the eighth Saturday in a row, millions of Canadians will be at a loose end tonight. They would normally be glued to television watching Hockey Night in Canada, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's most popular programme. But the North American ice hockey season has yet to start. Owners of the 26 US and Canadian teams which make up the national hockey league (NHL) locked out the players on September 30 after failing to persuade them to accept curbs on their rocketing salaries. No settlement is yet in sight, despite numerous meetings between the owners and the players' union. The season may be called off altogether if there is no breakthrough within the next three or four weeks. A similar pay dispute forced the cancellation of part of this year's baseball season, as well the world series baseball championship. While the labour dispute may be an annoyance for fans, many businesses, big and small, are counting more tangible costs. Molson, the diversified brewing group whose entertainment subsidiary produces Hockey Night in Canada and which owns the champion Montreal Canadiens, estimates that it will lose CDollars 10m-CDollars 11m (Pounds 4.4m-Pounds 4.9m) in operating profit, even if a shortened season starts on January 1. The loss would double if the entire season is cancelled. Among other public companies with a stake in the dispute are ITT, the US conglomerate which owns the New York Rangers through its interest in Madison Square Gardens, where the Rangers play their home games. Walt Disney owns the Anaheim Mighty Ducks, one of several teams in California and Florida which have helped ice hockey to migrate in recent years as far south as the Sun Belt. As with the baseball strike, TV revenues have been among the heaviest casualties. The NHL, which has been struggling for years to gain exposure on US mainstream television, recently signed a Dollars 100m, five-year deal with Mr Rupert Murdoch's Fox network. The dispute will need to be resolved soon if Fox's first hockey broadcast, the annual All-Stars game, is to go ahead as scheduled on January 21. The players are also big losers. Their union estimates that its members earned a total of around CDollars 500m last year. Several stars are in the CDollars 2m-CDollars 3m a year bracket. Finding another job has not been easy. One Anaheim player is publishing a children's book. The St Louis Blues' goal-tender has started flying lessons. Another player has signed up for a financial-planning course. Most people's sympathy, however, lies with neither greedy owners nor overpaid players, but rather with the thousands of entrepreneurs - hot-dog vendors, souvenir pedlars and taxi drivers, for instance - who have lost a big chunk of their livelihood and have little to fall back on.</p>

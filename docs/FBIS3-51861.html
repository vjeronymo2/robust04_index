			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Mexico, 25 Jan (AFP) -- The Zapatist National  Liberation Army (EZLN) condemned former Chiapas governor Absalon  Castellanos to life in prison but has decided to "give him  physical freedom and, instead, sentence him to live to the last  day of his life with the shame and embarrassment of having  received the forgiveness and kindness of people who for so long  a time he humiliated, kidnapped, dispossessed, robbed, and  murdered."    In a communique released today to the media, the EZLN, which  kidnapped Castellanos on 1 January, its first day of operations,  announced that the "court" had sentenced the former governor "to  life in prison, doing manual labor in an Indian community in  Chiapas, and thus earning his food and necessary means of  subsistence."    Castellanos, a retired Army general, was accused of "having  repressed, kidnapped, jailed, tortured, violated, and murdered  members of Indian towns in Chiapas who were struggling legally  and peacefully for their just rights. He was also accused of  having dispossessed the Indians of their lands "in complicity  with the federal government in office at the time" and of  "having become one of the most powerful landowners in Chiapas  State."    The commutation of his sentence and his pending release --  the communique is dated 20 January -- was presented as "a  message to the Mexican people and the peoples and governments of  the world."    In the city of San Cristobal de las Casas in Chiapas it was  announced today that Castellanos may "appear" at any time during  the course of this day in good physical condition.</p>

			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / Crimea raises tension with independence declaration THE parliament of Crimea yesterday declared independence in a move which is expected further to inflame the dispute between Ukraine and Russia over who should have control over the peninsular and the Black sea fleet which is based there. Crimea's declaration of independence from Ukraine does not mention Russia, but leading separatist politicians do not conceal their hope that the Crimea, which has a 60 per cent ethnic Russian population and only became part of Ukraine in 1954, will eventually join Russia. Hundreds of jubilant demonstrators ringing the parliament cheered and waved the Russian flag when a majority of Crimean deputies backed the declaration, which will come into force if confirmed by a referendum scheduled for August 2. The struggle between Ukraine and Russia over the Black Sea Fleet has been a proxy for conflicting claims to the picturesque peninsula which was annexed to the Russian empire by Catherine the Great but used to be home to hundreds of thousands of Crimean Tatars. More than 200,000 were exiled by Stalin in 1944 but many are now moving back to find that their old homes and land have been taken over by Russians and Ukrainians who have dotted the coastline with dachas and retirement homes. 'For Crimea, this means difficult days ahead,' said Mr Nikolai Bagrov, chairman of the Crimean parliament. Exhausted by the day's passionate and anarchic debate, Mr Bagrov acknowledged that the decision could lead to 'a sharpening' of the Ukrainian-Russian conflict. The declaration's announcement of 'the creation of a sovereign state, the republic of Crimea' is intentionally open to various interpretations. Deputies chose the weaker of two words meaning 'independence', which can be translated as 'self-determination', and voted to begin negotiating with Ukraine immediately. The referendum could thus be the first step towards eventual reunification with Russia or simply a bargaining chip to wrest greater autonomy from Ukraine. Whatever the interpretation, it is a defeat for the Ukrainian government which sought to forestall a referendum by offering Crimea extensive autonomy. Crimean MPs were not appeased and many said they feared the Ukrainian government intended to discriminate against Russians. Mr Volodymyr Filenko, a member of a Ukrainian parliamentary delegation which observed the debate, said one possible response from the Ukrainian government would be to dissolve the Crimean parliament. The Crimean decision is likely to hasten the Russian parliament's plan to consider the legality of the transfer of Crimea to Ukraine, a move Ukrainian politicians have said they would view as tantamount to a declaration of war.</p>

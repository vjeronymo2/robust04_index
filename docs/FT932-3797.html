			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / Russia applies formally to Gatt RUSSIA yesterday formally applied to join the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade while denying it was endangering foreign aid and investment flows. President Boris Yeltsin, who has launched market reforms that have sought to open up the Russian economy to the outside world, told Mr Arthur Dunkel, Gatt's outgoing secretary-general, that he hoped for admission by the end of this year. While Mr Dunkel remained politely non-committal, Mr Georgy Gabunia, a deputy Russian trade minister, admitted he thought it would take Russia at least two to three years to join. Meanwhile, Mr Alexander Shokhin, deputy prime minister responsible for foreign economic relations, denied reports that the International Monetary Fund wanted to delay disbursing the first Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 980m) of a systemic transformation facility promised for the end of June because Moscow was lagging behind with promised reforms. 'We have not deviated from schedule in our relations with the IMF. . . So far the IMF has every reason to fulfil its obligations.' Mr Shokhin also defended a ban for the month of June on the export of oil by foreign joint ventures, which has been a fresh blow to Russia's attempts to attract foreign investment, claiming it was simply an attempt to force companies to prove that the oil they exported was really produced by them. While joint ventures are sometimes used as a channel for illegal oil exports, the explanation sounded more like an improvisation, since the ban affects all joint ventures without discrimination between those which have provided information requested by the government and those which have not. Mr Shokhin also called on the US to drop its opposition to an Dollars 80m contract for Russia to supply India with rocket technology for satellite launches, saying Russia had little to lose from sanctions threatened by the US.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report; from "NHK News 7" program] </F>   [Text] The question of increasing the assigned frequencies  for Motorola-type mobile phone service has become a focal point  in the issue of opening the Japanese mobile phone market.  Today, the Japan Mobile Communications Corporation [known as  IDO] and Motorola reached agreement on the matter. Under the  agreement, IDO will transfer part of the frequencies assigned to  NTT [Nippon Telegraph &amp; Telephone]-type mobile phone service  to  the Motorola-type mobile phone service, with the two mobile  phone services sharing the assigned frequencies half-and-half,  and IDO working toward wider use of the Motorola-type mobile  phone service by increasing the number of ground radio stations  for the Motorola-type mobile phone service to 159 by the end of  1955.    In connection with the issue of opening the Japanese mobile  phone market, in mid-February the U.S. Government made clear  that it would take steps for imposing sanctions on Japan. Next  week, Japan and the United States will start governmental  negotiations. A Japanese Government official said that with the  agreement reached between IDO and Motorola, the possibility has  grown that the U.S. Government will not slap sanctions on Japan.</p>

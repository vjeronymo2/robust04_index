The talks were deadlocked when Ankara decided  that the Tehran regime's demands for the handing over of Ocalan  to Turkish officials would create a very serious situation for  Turkey.    The talks between the two countries began after Turkey  established where Osman Ocalan lived in Iran. Ankara contacted  the Iranian officials to have Ocalan returned to Turkey after  the Turkish officials established where he lived in Tehran and  Qom. The Tehran regime seemed willing during the initial stages  of the talks, which were also attended by Syrian officials from  time to time, to agree to return Ocalan to Turkey. However,  Iran later put forward excessive demands. The Iranian officials  first asked that all Iranian citizens in Turkey who opposed the  Tehran regime be returned to Iran and prevented from using  Turkey's territory for their activities. But that was not all.  The Iranian officials also asked that Mustafa Hejri, secretary  general of the Democratic Party of Kurdistan in Iran, be  returned to that country. Ankara officially informed Tehran  that Hejri does not live in Turkey.    It was ascertained during the talks that the Tehran regime  planned to execute their opponents without a trial as soon as  they were returned. The matter was assessed in several meetings  in Ankara and the view that the executions, which would take  place at gallows set up in the streets of Tehran, would create a  very strong reaction in Western countries, including the United  States, and cause Turkey to be blamed gained weight. It was  also stressed that the PKK may take such events as an  opportunity to launch a campaign against Turkey, in which it  would accuse the Turkish Government of "returning innocent  civilians to be executed in Iran."    In view of all that, the Turkish officials have decided to  suspend their talks with the Iranian officials "for the time  being." However, regardless of the deadlock, Turkey has not  abandoned its demand for the return of Ocalan, who is suffering  from a serious kidney trouble.</p>

These amendments would revise the definition of the term ``lime'' in order to cover seedless rather than seeded limes; increase the exemption level from less than 35,000 pounds annually to less than 200,000; alter the size, composition, and term of office of the Lime Board; and make necessary conforming changes. This action is necessary to implement amendments to the Lime Research, Promotion, and Consumer Information Act of 1990. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments must be received by May 9, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Interested persons are invited to submit written comments concerning this proposed rule to: Docket Clerk, Fruit and Vegetable Division, AMS, USDA, P.O.

The Order is effective under the Lime Research, Promotion, and Consumer Information Act of 1990 (1990 Act) (Pub. L. 101&hyph;624, 7 U.S.C. 6201&hyph;6212), as amended by the Lime Research, Promotion, and Consumer Information Improvement Act (1993 Act) (Pub. L. 103&hyph;194, Dec. 14, 1993).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This rule has been determined to be non-significant for the purposes of Executive Order 12866 and therefore has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. It is not intended to have retroactive effect. This rule would not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 1957 of the Act, a person subject to the Order may file a petition with the Secretary of Agriculture (Secretary) stating that the Order or any provision of the Order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the Order, is not in accordance with law and requesting a modification of the Order or an exemption from the Order. The petitioner is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After such hearing, the Secretary will make a ruling on the petition. The Act provides that the district courts of the United States in any district in which a person who is a petitioner resides or carries on business are vested with jurisdiction to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, if a complaint for that purpose is filed within 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Impact Analysis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this rule on small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The 1990 Act exempted lime producers who produce less than 35,000 pounds annually for the fresh market from being subject to the Order. When the 1990 Act was enacted, there were an estimated 325 producers who produced at least 35,000 pounds annually and were subject to the Order. When the 1993 Act was enacted, the exemption level was increased to less than 200,000 pounds annually. At this exemption level, there are an estimated 50 producers who produce at least 200,000 pounds and would be subject to the Order. Despite this increase in exemption level, the majority of producers subject to the Order would still be classified as small entities. Small agricultural producers have been defined by the Small Business Administration (SBA)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (13 CFR 121.601) as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The increase in exemption level is not expected to significantly affect the number of first handlers who are responsible for collecting and remitting producer assessments to the Lime Board (Board). The number of first handlers remains at approximately 25. The increase in exemption level, which also applies to imports, is not expected to significantly affect the number of importers of fresh market limes. The number of importers subject to the Order would increase from 5 to 35. However, this increase in importers is not primarily due to the increase in the exemption level but rather to the changing character of the lime industry. As in the case of producers, the majority of first handlers and importers subject to the Order would still be classified as small entities. Small agricultural service firms, which include handlers and importers, have been defined by the SBA as those having annual receipts of less than $3,500,000.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / Arts: Today's Television Thank goodness for BBC2. Even if the channel seems to be as besotted with the US as every other network in Britain, at least it still presents fresh and, quite often, intelligent programmes. While BBC1, ITV and Channel 4 concentrate on soap operas, embarrassing game shows with Anneka Rice and repeats, BBC2 is offering all sorts of different material. The Shetland Sessions (7.40) is the first in a series featuring local and international folk musicians recorded at the 1991 Shetland Folk Festival. At 8.10 the channel begins a three-part 'Timewatch' special on McCarthyism: The Un-Americans. With the cold war over, this is said to be the first investigation to concentrate not on the famous Hollywood targets but on ordinary men and women who were persecuted for supposed communist sympathies. Today's 'ScreenPlay' (9.00) is David Edgar's first original television drama, Buying A Landslide. The title is a reference to Joseph P. Kennedy's reported statement that he was happy to buy an election for John Kennedy 'but not a landslide'. Edinburgh Nights (11.15) pays tribute to the man who made the National Film And Television School what it is, Colin Young.</p>

			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / Poll boost for Argentina's rulers ARGENTINA'S Peronist government has emerged as the overwhelming victor in Sunday's mid-term congressional elections. The government took 42 per cent of the votes against 30 per cent for the Radicals, the main opposition party. The Peronist triumph was more significant for its defeat of the Radicals in Buenos Aires city, their stronghold, and a decisive victory in Buenos Aires province. The government now holds 48 per cent of the seats in the 257-strong lower Chamber of Deputies, against 45 per cent before the election. It already has a two-thirds majority in the Senate. The victory should increase President Carlos Menem's chances of amending the constitution so that he can run for re-election. The government's only significant reverse was in the province of Cordoba, where the Radicals have ruled for 10 years. The economy minister, Mr Domingo Cavallo, led the government campaign in Cordoba, but the Peronists won only 36 per cent of the votes - 2 points less than in the last elections two years ago. Mr Cavallo said yesterday he was 'sad and disappointed' with the outcome, attributed to local political rivalries. The minister's successful economic policies were the chief factor in the government's election victory but his rumoured bid for the presidency in 1995 now looks less likely.</p>

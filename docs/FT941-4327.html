			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / UK Company News: BM losses continue to mount BM Group, the engineering company which fell heavily into the red after provisions of Pounds 119.5m last year, yesterday said it had raised Pounds 80m in 12 months through the disposal programme which was launched in 1993 to reduce debt. The company sought to reassure investors as it revealed further write-downs and losses of Pounds 14.2m pre-tax for the first half, against profits of Pounds 8.6m last time. Sales were 12 per cent lower at Pounds 232.3m for the six months to December 31. Mr Moger Woolley, chairman, said the group was confident it would meet its targets on debt and disposals by the summer. Then BM would have to renegotiate banking facilities to replace the short-term support which expires in December. BM almost collapsed last year when it breached covenants on interest cover and net assets. The group had built up substantial debt following a series of acquisitions. Most of the Blackwood Hodge businesses had been sold, leaving BM with a group of process engineering operations and a product manufacturing division. The operating profit from these continuing operations fell from Pounds 12.44m to Pounds 1.86m. However, about Pounds 10m of the operating profit in the previous year had been due to the release of provisions and a pension credit. Mr Woolley said he expected debt to represent less than 90 per cent of the Pounds 58m (Pounds 60.2m) in shareholders' funds by the end of the year. BM would net a further Pounds 35m from the last of the significant asset disposals, he said, and about Pounds 14m in stock financing debt would be eliminated. This would bring borrowings - reported as Pounds 98m at the interim stage, against Pounds 114m at the year end - down to about Pounds 50m. BM took a Pounds 6m charge to rationalise the remaining Canadian business, bringing the total provisions arising from the lossmaking Canadian operations to Pounds 23m. BM is expected to remain substantially lossmaking this year. There are a further Pounds 42m in goodwill provisions expected as a result of disposals. Losses per share emerged at 13.6p (44.2p earnings) and the interim dividend is being omitted - 0.5p was paid previously.</p>

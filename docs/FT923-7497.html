			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / World Trade News: Mexican government to encourage further private investment in petrochemicals industry The Mexican government will encourage further private investment in the petrochemicals industry, by reducing the number of basic petrochemicals reserved to the state from 19 to 8, reports Damian Fraser in Mexico City. Under Mexican law, only the state-owned Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex) can make basic petrochemicals, defined as those chemicals that are the result of the first chemcical or physical transformation from gas or oil. This definition has proved to be elastic, and the number of basic petrochemicals has steadily been reduced over the past six years, according to political rather than scientific considerations.</p>

			<p><P> October 7, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MAN HELD IN SIEGE OVER A $20 DEBT  </P> <P> Walter Phillip Hallstein wanted $20 for a wading pool he had sold to a family  six months ago at a garage sale, say police.  </P> <P> And he meant business.  </P> <P> So shortly before noon Saturday, the 53-year-old Rossmoor man, toting a  12-gauge shotgun, allegedly went to the home of David Elizondo on Yellowtail  Drive in Rossmoor, held six adults and six children at gunpoint inside the  house for a few minutes and collected his money, sheriff's deputies said.  </P> <P> Then he left in a white station wagon.  </P> <P> After a four-hour search involving helicopters and deputies on the ground,  Hallstein was arrested without incident with the shotgun at 3:43 p.m. at Martha  Ann Drive and Bostonian Drive in Rossmoor, sheriff's Lt. Larry Richey said.  </P> <P> Hallstein was booked into Orange County Jail on suspicion of residential  robbery. No injuries were reported.  </P> <P> Sheriff's Lt. Harold Schaffroth said, "Sometimes people do things I just can't  believe."  </P> <P> Rossmoor is an unincorporated area of about 5,000 to 6,000 homes in western  Orange County, between Los Alamitos and Seal Beach.  </P></p>

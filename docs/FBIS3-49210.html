			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Dragoljub Micunovic, leader of the </F> Democratic Party, by Milenko Pesic; place and date not given:  "Micunovic: `I Might Have Achieved a Bigger Success in the  Election'"]    [Text] The Democratic Party members do not seem to have the  time to celebrate their election success. Immediately after the  votes were counted, the passions in the party leadership were  stirred up because Zoran Djindjic insisted, also formally, on  becoming chairman of the party.    We spoke with Dragoljub Micunovic, who has been the chairman  of the party for four years now, about the complex relations and  splits within the party and about the announcement of the  Democratic Party assembly in which a new party chairman should  be elected.    Micunovic pointed out which decisions were taken by the  Democratic Party bodies, and what the election procedure should  be like according to the bylaws, concluding that the assembly  scheduled for the beginning of February can only be  extraordinary (its agenda has already been defined) and in no  case electoral.    "It is possible that one-third of the delegates fills up the  agenda with the procedure by which my resignation from the  position of the party chairman would be required. If this  requirement is rejected, it is not possible to call for a vote  of censure in the party leader until the next regular electoral  assembly (in 1994)," Micunovic explained the complicated  election procedure.    If it happens that Micunovic, as he says himself, does not  obtain the vote of confidence, his duty will be taken over by  one of the Democratic Party vice chairmen, and the procedure for  the election of a new chairman will start.  <H5>  I Shall Ask for Fair Play </H5>   [Pesic] Will you run for the position of the party chairman  if the delegates do not vote for confidence in you as the party  chairman?    [Micunovic] No, I shall not run for this position. Why  should I run for the position of the party chairman? If the  Main Committee in its session on 9 January 1994 opens a  discussion on the confidence in the party chairman, I shall try  to make the month between this session and the scheduled  assembly at the beginning of February a period of democratic  fair play. I shall support the principle of equal treatment and  insist on the opportunity to visit our communal committees in  order to present my platform there and hear critical opinions  from our members at the same time.    [Pesic] You deny the impression created in public that your  position as party chairman has been weakened by the fact that  Djindjic won the election. You stress that "the Democratic  Party won the election."    If you had been the bearer of the election lists, would you  have achieved the same result?    [Micunovic] Perhaps an even better result, but this is mere  speculation. Djindjic also led the Democratic Party campaign in  earlier elections. He made decisions now and then about the  posters, TV spots, and so forth. I would like to point out that  our party campaign was carried out in a very professional way  this time and stood out because of its standard. The success of  a party cannot, however, be attributed to only one man.    Have you ever heard that if a party has been successful in  an  election, its chairman is dismissed after that? As far as  Djindjic's candidacy is concerned, it is his right according to  our bylaws to run for party chairman. Since the candidacy was  started in the middle of an election period, it is necessary to  respect the procedure defined by the bylaws.  <H5>  Personalized Race </H5>   [Pesic] The impression was created in public that it is  quite natural that Djindjic replaces you in the position of the  party chairman after the success he achieved in this election.    [Micunovic] This impression was created by the media because  Zoran Djindjic carried out two campaigns. One for the party, in  which he fought for votes, and the other for himself. The  Democratic Party election campaign was personalized. TV spots,  posters, badges, cigarette lighters were marked exclusively with  Djindjic's name. This resulted in the impression that the  Democratic Party is connected only with his name.    I think highly of all of Djindjic's qualities and merits for  the achieved election result, but the Democratic Party decided  not to be a party characterized by its leader.    I do not want to deny that splits arouse within the  Democratic Party because of Djindjic's candidacy for the  position of party chairman. I think that it is sensible to make  changes only if a party chairman harms his party or destroys its  reputation.    [Pesic] How can the present splits, which harm the party,  be overcome?    [Micunovic] The decisions taken by the Central Committee  have to be respected. One of these decisions is that all  Democratic Party bodies must function according to the effective  bylaws. Only in this way can we overcome the present  polarization.    [Pesic] There is still the impression that you are supported  only by a party minority after this election.    [Micunovic] This is something to be measured yet. It is  certain that during the election the popularity of Mr. Djindjic  rose. The final decision, however, will be taken by the  assembly delegates.    I have contacts with the Executive Committee chairman  [Djindjic], but our relations are not as normal as they should  be. The reason for it is his engagement in the election campaign  that was completed only a few days ago.  <H5>  Compromise in the Interest of the Party </H5>   [Pesic] There are people who think that you should have  resigned after this election because the Democratic Party  achieved poor results in their opinion.    [Micunovic] This would mean that everybody who does not win  an election, and no opposition party in Serbia has been  successful so far, has to resign. This is a bad comparison with  the English Parliament in which there are three parties. Also  after this election, the Democratic Party has remained the  fourth strongest party, before the Socialist Party, the Radical  Party and the DEPOS, and we have no chance of endangering the  Socialist Party. We obtained half a million votes this time,  and in the previous election for the Federal Parliament we  obtained in the coalition with the "Reformers" 460,000 votes.    In the interest of the party I made a compromise and agreed  with the proposal that Djindjic bore the election lists. In  this way I agreed to sacrifice a part of my prestige and I do  not regret my decision. I think that the party will correctly  understand my readiness to serve the Democratic Party -- I do  not want the party to serve me.    The Democratic Party is organized according to democratic  standards in order to be an alternative to the communist and  socialist party. The Democratic Party has in this way become  the model of the democratic political milieu in contrast to the  long-lasting authoritarian way of thinking. If the Democratic  Party gave up its original political intentions, it would betray  most of its members and supporters who joined us because they  did not way authoritarian leaders. I believe that the  Democratic party will not give up its principles.</p>

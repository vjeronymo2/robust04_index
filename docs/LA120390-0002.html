			<p><P> December 3, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONTRACEPTION AND ABORTION  </P> <P> Truer words were never printed than Holtzman's. There remains, however, one  crucial factor to add to her list of reasons to support family planning: Global  population is on the verge of tripling.  </P> <P> Nowhere is the population crisis more disastrous than in the United States,  where each of the 1.5 million increased annual births impact the planet 60  times as hard as those in underdeveloped countries. At a time when ecological  emergencies abound, ignoring or discrediting the value of family planning is  the most foolhardy attitude imaginable.  </P> <P> CAROL BENSON HOLST, Multi-Cultural Task Force, Zero Population Growth, Glendale  </P></p>

			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Indonesia's overstretched rubber industry - A downturn in production after years of bucking the world trend THE DECLINE of the international natural rubber market may finally have caught up with Indonesia. The Rubber Association of Indonesia (Gapkindo) expects production to decline by 20 per cent this year as farmers turn to more lucrative crops. This would be the first major reversal for a country which has bucked the trend by increasing production during a period of low commodity prices. Indonesia is the world's second largest rubber producer, with output rising from 1.05m tonnes in 1985 to 1.27m tonnes last year with an estimated 3.1m hectares (7.6m acres) under cultivation. The value of Indonesia's rubber exports in 1990 amounted to USDollars 855m, the third largest non-oil export after manufactured goods and forest products. Mr AF Budiman, executive director of Gapkindo, describes the outlook as 'very gloomy'. Hazy skies caused by last year's extensive forest fires are partly to blame for the fall in production (a lower rate of photosynthesis results in reduced yield) but he says the main culprit is the international pricing system. Consumers, such as the international tyre companies, prefer to buy direct from processors in Indonesia and cut out traders in Singapore. Dr Budiman says this has reduced the volume and quality of rubber appearing at auction and kept prices low. The price agreed between the tyre companies and processors, however, is based upon the auction price, albeit with a small quality premium of between 2 and 5 Singapore cents a kilogram. As a result, Mr Budiman explains, 'many processors feel the price they get is already discounted'. The price squeeze is beginning to hurt processors and farmers. Indonesia's SIR-20 rubber is fetching about 40 cents a lb in the US, which buys half Indonesia's production. Industry officials say the price would have to reach 50 cents a lb for business to be remunerative. A solution might be for the processors to channel more of their production through the Singapore market, forcing tyre companies to buy from the traders and increasing the auction price. The initiative is already being taken by PT Nusira, Indonesia's largest processor, which has five factories with a total capacity of 12,000 tonnes a month. Mr Hasan Bahari, a director of Nusira, says that the company sells 90 per cent of its production direct to tyre companies, mainly Goodyear and Yokohama, with the remainder being purchased by traders. However, Nusira has decided to reduce direct sales to 70 per cent of production, Mr Bahari says. Whether this will become an industry-wide trend remains unclear. As Mr Budiman explains, the processors 'have already invested a lot to fulfil the needs of the (direct) customers'. For some producers a price rise could not come soon enough. Gapkindo estimates that 10 per cent of processors have either closed or are operating at significantly reduced capacity. Smallholders, who make up some 80 per cent of production and are paid about 70 per cent of the world market price for their rubber, are cutting back acreage, Mr Budiman says. Mr Bahari remains more bullish about the future. He says that most farmers, although unhappy with the price they receive, are tied into rubber production and Nusira is not anticipating a problem with supply. Indeed Nusira plans to increase capacity by 7 per cent this year. 'Other companies are reducing their production. We are increasing to lower our costs", he explains. A shake-out of the processing industry is likely. Gapkindo estimates that high bank interest rates, averaging 27 per cent a year, have increased production costs by up to 30 per cent in recent years. Smaller and less efficient processors may fall by the wayside. Industry concern at low prices is likely to result in demands for the re-structuring of the International Natural Rubber Agreement, signed in 1987 and due to expire this year, which agreed a level of buffer stock and intervention prices. Indonesia was late in paying its financial dues in January to the International Natural Rubber Organisation, which encompasses both producers and consumers. Although Gapkindo says the late payment resulted from a 'technical' hitch, government officials are reported to be concerned at the organisation's failure to lift prices out of their three year trough. A meeting of producing nations to agree proposed changes to the international agreement is scheduled for April 29-30 in Changmai, Thailand. Such proposals might include an increase in the size of the buffer stock, and a narrower band of intervention prices. As one Indonesian official comments, 'Although not stated specifically, what we want is higher prices'. The recent recovery in natural rubber prices appears too short of fundamental support to last, according to the Economist Intelligence Unit's latest World Commodity Forecasts, writes David Blackwell. The EIU has again lowered expectations for the economy of the US, the world's largest consumer of rubber. The small recovery of oil prices - which govern the cost of synthetic rubber - is unlikely to be of much support to natural rubber prices. Little support is expected from restocking demand. The low prices of the last couple of years are to some extent explained by the recent upward revisions for global production figures by the International Rubber Study Group, the EIU believes. Belated production cuts rather than any real recovery in demand have strengthened the market. The best hope for better prices 'must come from an upturn in global demand' as well as continued reduction in production in Malaysia and elsewhere. The recovery from a low of 49.5 pence a kilogram in London on February 10 to more than 54 pence a kilogram came just in time to avert a threat to the International Rubber Agreement, whose members were unable to agree on reducing the buffer stock intervention price bands.</p>

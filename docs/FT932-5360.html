			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / Aboriginal land deal proposed: Australian package condemned THE AUSTRALIAN govern-ment yesterday proposed a sweeping package to protect private mining and pastoral leases from aboriginal land claims. The 33-point package includes legislation that would validate land titles issued between 1975 and the end of this month. The move came on the eve of the first anniversary of a high court decision which, for the first time, acknowledged that indigenous people had occupied Australia before European settlement and still had rights to the land under common law. Since that decision, aboriginal land councils have been preparing to present claims in various courts around Australia. One aboriginal tribe in the state of New South Wales recently lodged a writ calling for the commonwealth and state governments to give up almost a quarter of the state. The government package also proposes to establish a formula under which federal and state governments would share compensation payments to aboriginal groups that might incur losses when leases are granted to private holders. It also calls for the setting up of a special tribunal to deal with aboriginal land claims. Aboriginal land council officials have called the package a 'slimy and useless piece of paper'. Meanwhile, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission insists on veto power over land development, and on mining royalties for development on land with native titles. Mr Robert Tickner, the minister for aboriginal affairs, said the package was on the table for discussion. 'It is not set in concrete,' he said. The government has already attempted legislation to protect a large development project in the Northern Territory. Last week it supported a local government bill that would override native titles covering leases to a ADollars 300m (Pounds 134m) lead-zinc mining project. The McArthur river project, proposed to be developed by the Australian mining group MIM and its Japanese partners, is expected to earn ADollars 200m a year in exports. Australia's foreign debt as at the end of the March quarter stood at ADollars 160.6bn (Pounds 72bn), a fall of 3.9 per cent from the figure at the end of the previous December quarter. This was the first quarterly fall in almost three years and was attributed to debt repayments made by both the public and private sectors taking advantage of lower interest rates. The figure is, however, 7.9 per cent higher than at the end of the March quarter last year. Of the net foreign debt, the private sector accounted for 65 per cent or ADollars 104.6m. The ratio of the net foreign debt to GDP was 40.6 per cent, down 1.9 per cent at the end of the previous quarter. A permanent reduction in Australia's foreign debt is unlikely in the foreseeable future because of the continuing high current account deficit.</p>

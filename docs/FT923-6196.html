			<p>920826 FT  26 AUG 92 / The Markets Under Strain: Central banks losing the fight over the dollar THESE are worrying days for the world's central bankers. For the past six weeks, they have been steadily losing the fight to stop the fall of the US dollar against the D-Mark. They have tried to control the dollar by intervening in the foreign exchange markets, buying the US dollar for D-Marks to try to hold its exchange rate. But this tested method of controlling the market has failed. 'I have to go back a long way to remember a time when central bank intervention has collapsed so miserably,' said Mr Julian Simmonds, head of foreign exchange dealing at Citibank in London. Since the mid-1980s, intervention has been effective in controlling markets. Dealers are wary of central banks, knowing they have far larger foreign currency reserves than most investors, but five interventions since July 20 have failed to turn the dollar. 'Their intervention has proved ineffective and even counter-productive,' said Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Yamaichi International in London. There are several reasons: The markets believe there is lack of co-ordination among G7 members over monetary policy. Intervention is most likely to work when it reflects clear changes in monetary policy and interest rate movements. In 1985, the Fed managed to prevent the dollar rising too high against the D-Mark by buying small quantities of dollars on the foreign exchanges. The current situation is different. The world's central banks are intervening against the grain of monetary policy, because there is a differential of 6.75 percentage points between US and German short term rates. Dealers believe that intervention is being poorly co-ordinated on a technical level because of these discrepancies in monetary policy. The market is uncertain about Bundesbank commitment to support the dollar. By buying dollars in intervention operations, the German central bank puts large numbers of D-Marks into circulation. That upsets its key goal, containment of monetary growth. Interventions have run into technical difficulties because the market is not sufficiently short of dollars, even though the dollar/D-Mark exchange rate is plummeting. A successful intervention should 'squeeze' the market like contracting elastic. First, the market sells dollars, pushing the dollar/D-Mark exchange rate down. Central banks then reverse the exchange rate trend, and dealers rush to buy for fear that it will be more expensive to do so if they delay. One necessary element is that the markets be taken by surprise. However, since the end of July, dealers have been expecting intervention and held on to some dollars. The central banks cannot therefore trigger a rush in the opposite direction. 'The central banks have not frightened the market, they have anaesthetised it,' says Mr MacKinnon. The US central bank could argue that it has never intended to reverse the dollar's decline, knowing this is impossible. Instead, their policy may be to slow the dollar's fall, ensuring that the decline does not turn into a rout. This view is underlined by the modest level of intervention. At the beginning of 1989, the Group of Seven leading industrial nations spent Dollars 3bn in one week to support the dollar against the Japanese yen in a successful operation. The central banks have spent that much in the last six weeks.</p>

			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Customs and Excise adds to burdens Sir, I read with great interest Peter Norman's article on the first prosecution of a UK company for failure to provide Intrastat returns ('Company fined over missing trade statistics', November 9). Dams International has my sympathy. I know only too well the additional burden which has been placed on UK businesses by Customs and Excise with this latest statutory requirement. However, the closing comments by customs officials that the Intrastat system is 'less burdensome than previously' is a little difficult to comprehend. Certainly it is less burdensome for Customs and Excise as the entire burden falls on UK businesses to collect these statistics. From our own experience, the investment in extra administrative and systems development has had an all too real cost, which certainly does not fit in with the stated 'savings to UK businesses of Pounds 135m'. Surely Customs and Excise is referring to savings by central government, it having once again passed the onus for collection of tedious statistics to UK businesses? There are many further examples, including National Insurance and value added tax on private fuel, etc. It is difficult for us to see the savings.

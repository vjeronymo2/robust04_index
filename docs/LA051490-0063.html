			<p><P> May 14, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONTENDERS AND ISSUES: HIGHLIGHTS OF THE DEBATE  </P> <P> Following are excerpts on key topics covered in Sunday night's Democratic  gubernatorial debate in San Francisco between former San Francisco Mayor Dianne  Feinstein and Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp:  </P> <P> ABORTION  </P> <P> Van de Kamp: "When it gets to (a woman's right to a) choice, I will not impose  my religious values (as a Catholic) because I don't want them to impose it on  me. And I just have to ask Mrs. Feinstein because this has come up a number of  times in this race, she's implying that because I'm a Catholic I cannot truly  be pro-choice."  </P> <P> Feinstein: "John, I have no problem with your being a Catholic, I have the  greatest respect for that. What I have a problem with is your record, your  defense of the governor's cut of Medi-Cal for abortions for poor women five  years in a row, your defense of the governor's cut for family planning clinics  two years in a row. I just simply am saying that I believe that a woman's right  to choose is best protected by a woman who believes, personally, who will veto  any legislation that infringes on that right."  </P> <P> PERSONAL FINANCES  </P> <P> Van de Kamp: "I think we're entitled to know who is behind Mayor Feinstein, who  the investors are behind her husband (investment banker Richard C. Blum), what  the influences are and by the way, why no (personal federal income) taxes in  1985?"  </P> <P> Feinstein: "I do want to answer your question on why no taxes. . . . Why no  taxes? Because we signed a joint return. My husband took a major loss with a  series of ice cream parlors and that was the reason (no federal income taxes  were paid). You know, you've been very sanctimonious, John. You tried not to  reveal your own family trust and when it was revealed there were 14 companies  doing business with South Africa as part of that trust. So if I were you, I  wouldn't be quite so sanctimonious."  </P> <P> SAN FRANCISCO'S FINANCES  </P> <P> Feinstein: "There was a $77-million shortfall (in city revenues). . . .  Shortfalls are nothing new. They are not going to be anything new to San  Francisco. They are not going to be anything new to the state. . . . I have  certain ways I would have handled it, yes, and certain priorities. The city  census hired 1,200 new workers. I probably would not have done some of that,  hiring. . . . One of the things I've learned is key and critical is a reserve  (fund). And that is one of the reasons I would insist on having a state  reserve. . . . "  </P> <P> Van de Kamp: "There is a word that Mrs. Feinstein just can't use. Apparently  it's not within her. Say the word 'deficit,' the 'D' word. It's easy, and I  think you'll feel a lot better. All of us make mistakes. Mrs. Feinstein  inherited a surplus, she spent it down, she raised the number of employees in  San Francisco by 3,000 and she left Mayor (Art) Agnos in a deep, deep hole."  </P> <P> GOVERNMENT ETHICS  </P> <P> Van de Kamp: "All the while, as I've been attorney general, we've taken a great  number of enforcement investigations, a great number of enforcement actions,  against those in public life at the state, judicial and local levels. We've  taken about 25 enforcement actions out of 100 cases where the evidence  justified it. . . . By and large, it's been a good record, hampered in large  part by the failure of state laws. And that's why I have an ethics initiative  on the ballot in November."  </P> <P> Feinstein: "My records indicate that in 1987 there were 25 bills, either on  ethics or campaign reform, that were deemed significant and the attorney  general took no position on those bills. I'm not familiar with any vigorous  prosecutions, certainly of members of the Legislature. . . ."  </P> <P> LEADERSHIP  </P> <P> Feinstein: " . . . What's most important, I think, is someone who can lead and  change. If you want to do things just as they've always been done, take the  insider candidate, I think that's clearly the choice that exists in this  election. I'm going to shake things up if I get there and I'm going to have the  freedom to do it."  </P> <P> Van de Kamp: " . . . I believe in basic Democratic principles which represent  the majority of the people of this state, and that is for equity, it's for good  government that delivers the goods. It's for leading this state with real  change. . . . We're going to change California for the better."  </P> <P> CLOSING REMARKS  </P> <P> Van de Kamp: "Thank you for staying with us and not switching to 'The Simpsons'  tonight. . . . Now, I'm not the favorite candidate of the status quo or the oil  companies or the chemical companies or the gun lobby, because you can't keep  the California dream alive doing business as usual."  </P> <P> Feinstein: " . . . I never thought I'd be here on a Mother's Day but here I am.  . . . This election I think is really a choice between two Californias, it's a  choice between the California of diminishing dreams, the California of high  school dropouts, of unsafe streets, of unmanaged growth, of increasing  pollution, or it's a California that is boldly going to take a step in to the  future, and take its place as leader in the Pacific Rim and assert some new  values."  </P></p>

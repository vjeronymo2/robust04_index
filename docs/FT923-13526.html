			<p>920713 FT  13 JUL 92 / Paint sales point to low industrial activity one of the more certain indicators of industrial activity - plunged in May and June, suggesting that a significant economic upturn may not be evident before next year, Ian Hamilton Fazey writes. The Paintmakers Association annual conference in Torquay at the weekend heard that an uplift in sales in the first quarter of this year was a false dawn. Figures have not yet been collated, but companies described May sales as 'grim' and those in June as 'dire'. If the economy falters and fewer things are being made, paint sales dip, usually faster than gross domestic product, as manufacturers stop buying and use up stocks. Conversely, recovery sees paint orders pick up at a faster rate than GDP as restocking takes place alongside growth. The conference was also told that some companies have needlessly committed themselves to extra costs by pre-empting environmental law. The standards are for emissions of volatile organic compounds - mainly solvent from industrial paints and coatings - and are to be enforced by 405 councils. If a company commits itself to tighter controls than those required by law, it must adhere to them and cannot revert to legal limits.</p>

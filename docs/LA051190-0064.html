			<p><P> May 11, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BASEBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> PIRATES GET NO RELIEF IN 10-4 LOSS  </P> <P> The Pittsburgh Pirates entered Thursday night's game against the Cincinnati  Reds with a five-game winning streak and an unbeaten bullpen that had a 1.55  earned-run average.  </P> <P> The streak ended and the ERA ballooned when the Reds launched an eight-run,  eighth-inning rally in a 10-4 victory at Pittsburgh.  </P> <P> Rookie Joe Oliver hit a three-run home run, and Paul O'Neill had a sacrifice  fly and two-run single in the eighth as the Reds improved to 13-3 on the road  and raised their National League West lead to seven games over the Dodgers. The  East-leading Pirates lost for the fourth time in the past 19 games and lead the  Montreal Expos by 2 1/2.  </P> <P> Pirate reliever Ted Power (0-1), who was previously unscored upon in 13  innings, saw his ERA jump to 3.38 by giving up six hits and six runs in the  eighth.  </P> <P> With the score, 2-2, after seven innings, Barry Larkin doubled, Todd Benzinger  tripled and O'Neill hit a sacrifice fly off Power to make it 4-2.  </P> <P> Mariano Duncan and Billy Hatcher singled, Oliver homered and Norm Charlton  (1-0) beat out an infield hit to chase Power, who is 0-4 in four appearances  against the Reds in his career.  </P> <P> Bob Kipper, making his first appearance after elbow surgery, retired Chris Sabo  on a groundout before Herm Winningham singled and Larkin walked to load the  bases. Shortstop Jay Bell committed a error on a grounder by Benzinger allowing  Charlton to score, and O'Neill's two-run single capped the inning.  </P> <P> San Diego 9, St. Louis 1 -- Roberto Alomar raised his average to .358 with two  doubles and two singles at St. Louis, and the Padres handed the Cardinals their  sixth loss in seven games.  </P> <P> Alomar has batted .458 while hitting safely in 11 of his last 12 games.  </P> <P> Garry Templeton and Bip Roberts each hit two-run homers to back Dennis  Rasmussen (3-1), who scattered seven hits.  </P> <P> Joe Magrane (0-6) lost for the eighth consecutive time in 13 starts since Aug.  29.  </P> <P>  Todd Zeile hit his third homer for the Cardinals, who have scored three or  fewer runs in seven of their last eight.  </P> <P> Kansas City 6, Texas 2 -- Bo Jackson's three-run homer off the right-field foul  pole keyed a six-run eighth inning at Arlington, Tex.  </P> <P> Jackson's homer off reliever Gary Mielke was his second of the season.  </P> <P> Jeff Montgomery (3-1) pitched 2 2/3 hitless innings after relieving starter Tom  Gordon, who gave up two runs on six hits.  </P> <P> Kevin Brown (5-1), who had a six-hit shutout after seven innings, suffered his  first loss.  </P> <P> Detroit 10, Toronto 5 -- Temperatures were in the 30s and there were occasional  snow showers at Detroit, but Cecil Fielder continued to swing a hot bat for the  Tigers.  </P> <P> Fielder had three hits, including his major league-leading 13th home run, and  drove in three runs as the Tigers beat Todd Stottlemyre (4-3), who had won four  consecutive decisions.  </P> <P> Mookie Wilson homered for the Blue Jays, and Larry Sheets homered for the  Tigers.  </P> <P> Jeff Robinson (2-3) gave up five runs and seven hits in 6 1/3 innings for the  victory.  </P> <P> Minnesota 3 Cleveland 2 -- Gary Gaetti's two-run double at Minneapolis capped a  three-run sixth inning that gave the Twins their seventh victory in eight  games.  </P> <P> Roy Smith (1-3) got the victory, giving up six hits in 6 2/3 innings.  </P> <P> Rick Aguilera pitched two scoreless innings for his seventh save.  </P> <P> Cory Snyder homered for the Indians.  </P></p>

			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / Business Travel: Striking a blow for the airlines - When the industrial action is over, some passengers may not return to UK trains While it may be a pain in the neck for business travellers, for UK airlines the signal workers' strike on one or two days a week since mid-June has been a godsend. British Midland claims to have carried 27,000 extra passengers in the past three months, compared with the same period last year; while British Airways is reporting an extra 9,000-10,000 passengers a week on its domestic routes - a 10 per cent increase on numbers 12 months ago. No one yet knows how many of these newly won passengers will stay with the airlines once the strike is over. As British Midland's spokeswoman says: 'So far, the figures suggest that they've mostly been travelling on strike days. There's no evidence - yet - that people are fundamentally changing their habits.' What the airlines do know, however, is that it gives them a new group of customers to whom they can advertise their product. BA recognises that many business travellers' first experience of the airline will be on a domestic route. 'It is,' according to the company, 'our shop window. It's where we sell BA.' To this end, the airline has been introducing incentives, including a no-reservation shuttle service on the London-Glasgow and London-Manchester routes; automated ticket dispensers; and complimentary food and drink on all flights, no matter how brief. 'You get a four-course meal and a drink on the London-Glasgow route. It's a masterpiece of timing,' proclaims BA. But British Midland's latest manoeuvre in the battle for business travellers is perhaps more interesting. This week sees the introduction of the Diamond Pass: a season ticket entitling the holder to five return journeys to any of the airline's destinations within a period of three months from the date of issue. The price is Pounds 699: which means that, on some routes, a British Midland pass holder could save as much as Pounds 221 over the equivalent five first-class rail tickets. 'We've had this planned since the start of the year,' says British Midland. 'It's not a response to the rail strike, and we're not trying to capitalise on it.' It does, however, throw a new element into the business traveller's equation of time, convenience and cost. Even without British Midland's new initiative, ticket prices on some routes are already creeping towards parity. Although an InterCity first-class return from London to Manchester stands at Pounds 130, against Pounds 180 for an equivalent BA ticket, a first-class InterCity return from London to Glasgow is Pounds 184, while on BA or British Midland, the equivalent is Pounds 224. For London to Newcastle, the figures are even closer - Pounds 180 for InterCity, Pounds 206 for BA/British Midland. Throw in considerations such as time and convenience, and InterCity's advantage shrinks further. London to Manchester by train takes two and a half hours, plus half an hour, say, to get to the station; the plane takes 50 minutes, plus, say, an hour and a half to reach Heathrow and check in. Glasgow, on the other hand, takes five and half hours by rail, compared with an hour and a quarter by air. This is where British Midland's strategy looks most effective. Leaving aside the logistical questions (such as whether you are going from city centre to city centre, or outskirts to outskirts), if you can save on price as well as time on the longer routes by going by air, the logic of train over plane evaporates. As BA puts it: 'We've seen a steady growth in the number of business travellers flying over the last few years, and although we're not doing any special research to find out who's going to change from rail to air after the strike, the fact is that some people are bound to change for good.' Luckily for InterCity, there are not enough airports to turn the UK into another United States, where businessmen fly everywhere. But with every day of strike action, InterCity must view the future with rather less certainty.</p>

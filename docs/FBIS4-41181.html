			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by KAZTAG correspondent Konstantin Borodnikov for </F> TASS]    [Text] Almaty 22 June TASS -- I tried to make sure that new  competent officials come forth to lead, who know what is  business, banking system and today's reforms, President  Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan said talking to ITAR-TASS.  He was commenting upon serious changes made in the Republic's  power body structures and reshuffles during the past short  period.    "Lately the government was working out a programme of its  actions which will be presented to the Supreme Soviet. Under  the new programme, the new government will form a team and  together with it carry out the programme," the Kazakh president  said. According to Nazarbayev, among reappointed ministers and  chiefs of departments are mainly those who took part in  preparing the programme.    Nazarbayev also said that the president's office will  strictly monitor the fulfillment of the programme proposed to  the government. There is nothing to be surprised at, Nazarbayev  emphasised. According to him, in all civilized democratic  countries of the world every government comes forward with a  definite programme which it puts before the society. The people  accept it and allot time to fulfill it. Together with the fate  of such a programme the fate of the government is also decided.  If the government is able to cope with its work, it is normal.  If the government does not fulfill its promises, it must  resign, the Kazakh president said.</p>

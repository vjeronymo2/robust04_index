			<p><P> November 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: SANTA MONICA;  </P> <P> COUNCIL REVISITS DISPUTE  </P> <P> The City Council reaffirmed its approval of a large commercial office project  at Santa Monica Municipal Airport, but added a provision that would strike it  down if a referendum opposing the project is successful.  </P> <P> Last week, a citizens group submitted nearly 9,000 signatures against the  project to the city clerk. If at least 5,644 signatures are verified by the  county registrar, the City Council would be forced to reverse its decision or  place the matter on the ballot.  </P> <P> Several residents repeated their opposition to the 822,000-square-foot project.  One resident said: "The people overwhelmingly gave their choice" against the  project.  </P> <P> Mayor Dennis Zane, an avid supporter of the project, said it is needed because  of the revenue it would provide the city, and vowed to vigorously campaign for  it, if the matter is placed on the ballot.  </P></p>

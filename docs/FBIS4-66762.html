			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Report on interview with members of National Front for the </F> Salvation of Libya, by 'Ali al-Ruz in Stockholm; date not given:  "We Formed Three Organizations; the Regime Discovered the Plan"]    [Text] Three Libyan officers have been able to flee Libya  after taking part in the events known as the "October uprising."  They may be the only members of the secret military organization  to escape imprisonment. They were able to reach a "safe haven"  after five months of transiting through Arab and foreign  countries. They are now members of the (opposition) National  Front for the Salvation of Libya, which they said has had a plan  of internal action to bring down the regime and "establish a  constitutional democratic alternative" since 1992.    The officers, whom AL-HAYAH interviewed in a Scandanavian  country, were preparing their departure for another destination,  as other opposition members--also Front members--were doing; for  them, exile consists of constantly changing locales.    What are the facts about the "uprising," the arrests, the  secret military organization, and their connection to the  Salvation Front? Why do most of the detainees belong to the  Warfallah tribe? How was the organization's plan discovered? How  did the officers manage to flee Libya? The officers answered  these and other questions as follows:    Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Muhammad Bashir Salih, 36, was  born in Bani Walid. He joined the army in 1978, and was trained  in Yugoslavia and Russia. He says that since 1988 he had  considered playing a role for change and joined the secret  military organization led by Major 'Abd-al-Salam al-Wa'ir in  1991 after the latter told him about it.    Salih says that "the Libyan situation is what dictated this  course of action to me. We have no state, no institutions, no  laws, nor a constitution. Our wealth is being wasted by the  leaders of this regime, and the army, which supposedly is based  on discipline, following orders, abilities, and a clear  objective, is the state's protection. At first, its role was  reduced to protecting the regime; then it shrank even further,  to suit the interests of guard regiments such as the Deterrent  Force and the 9th Brigade, because the regime does not trust its  own people. So the units of these regiments are controlled by  officers of the al-Qadhadhifah tribe.  <H5>  Warfallah </H5>   Speaking of the role of the Warfallah tribe in the military  mutiny, especially as it is known to support the Libyan regime,  Maj. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Wa'ir, 38, of Bani Walid, has this to say:  "Contrary to popular belief, the Warfallah tribe was not with  our tribe (170,000 persons), which is large and scattered  throughout all the regions of Libya. Traditionally, it has  protected the al-Qadhadhifah from raids. It gave them their land  in Surt. If you mean the members of the Revolutionary  Committees, why, every tribe has its upstarts or opportunists,  so this is not surprising."    He explained that "even if most of those taking part in  military action were Warfallah, that does not mean that other  tribes did not take part. A quick look at the names of the  detainees shows that they come from every tribe and region. Plus  the fact that the objective of the action was not narrow or  strictly `Warfalli' in its principles. The proof is that as  military officers we all agreed to hand power over to a  civilian, in the event our movement succeeded. That civilian  would have been Dr. Muhammad al-Muqaryif, and he is not from the  Warfallah."    Captain Salim Dabnun Muhammad al-Wa'ir, 31, is from Bani  Walid, and says that the Warfallah "is a tribe scattered through  Tripoli, Misratah, Banghazi, Surt, Sabha, and the south. No  Libyan regime can stand against it. The present regime has  sought aid from a group of opportunists and chosen them to be  what is called an authority, a resource for finding a tribal  deterrent for it. It has succeeded in this to a great extent,  even though the tribe has been hurt more than anyone." Lt. Col.  Salih says that "the city of Bani Walid has stayed the way it is  since the Turks left it. It has no water system, no good roads,  nor an infrastructure."  <H5>  The Secret Organization </H5>   How was the secret military organization established? Capt.  'Abd-al-Salam al-Wa'ir says that he was first responsible for  the idea of an organization, "and following my graduation in  1980 the army was assigning tasks whose objectives were unknown.  We fought in Chad and Uganda. I lived in Lebanon from 1987 with  the volunteers' set-up for the victory of what were called  national and Islamic forces, and helping Palestinian  organizations. In December 1988, I returned to Libya and  proposed the idea of this organization to a group of officers.  There were five of us. Then I went back to Lebanon in 1990 and  met Col. Mustafa Bil-Qasim in an Arab country, and told him  about the organization. We agreed that he would work in one  fashion, and I would work in another, in total secrecy. I went  back to Libya at the end of 1991 and completed the structure of  the organization, which now had 10 men. I believe that the  number of members in Mustafa's organization was comparable to  our number."    Lt. Col. Salih explains, "'Abd-al-Salam studied matters  carefully before choosing members. He nominated me in 1990 for  organization membership; my comrades were put under  surveillance, then 1991 brought my intention and my proper role.  I agreed immediately and enthusiastically, because I had  patriotic feelings, but order was lacking in the organization. I  was not afraid at all, because someone who is afraid cannot  think of action anyway, and will look for the easy way out."    Capt. Salim al-Wa'ir says, "I graduated from public high  school in 1983 and was surprised to find that my official course  was to join the army, because in Libya they choose your future  career. I left in 1985 and was assigned to Bani Walid in a  marine battalion, then I was transferred to the Republican Guard  brigade, which has been assigned to guarding the regime since  1986, and I remained part of it until I left Libya. In 1988, I  learned of the organization's order from 'Abd-al-Salam, and I  gave my consent immediately, especially since a passion for  change burned in my heart--against corruption, bribery,  domination, control, the absence of institutions, and the  perversion of the very concept of government."    The three officers agree that they would hold no extended  meetings, only brief encounters in a car or one of their houses;  there were never more than three persons present at any one  meeting. Any talk of politics was forbidden. They had excellent  relations with those known for their loyalty to the regime, in  order to dispel any suspicion. Salih says, "'Abd-al-Salam told  us to coordinate with other organizations--some of us had no  knowledge that these organizations even existed."  <H5>  The "Salvation Front" </H5>   'Abd-al-Salam says that in 1992 he told Col. Bil-Qasim of  the  need to open a channel of communication with the National Front  for the Salvation of Libya abroad, "because it was the one  effective faction, and news of it reached us through smuggled  newspapers or broadcasts, and because its members were known in  Libya for their honesty and ability, and I agreed to this.    "I began to get indirect contacts, from which we understood  that the Front had linked up with domestic military action."    He continues: "In 1993, a third organization, headed up by  Col. Miftah Qarrum Fakkallah (who suffers from leukemia), joined  the first two, and one of the members of this organization, Maj.  Khalil al-Jidak, surprised Col. Bil-Qasim by broaching this  subject with him, of joining the organization, then the picture  cleared up and we became three organizations with nearly equal  memberships, with a broad network of relations with ranking  officers, civilians, and technocrats. We agreed to intensify our  contacts with the Front, to speed up our action. Al-Jidak opened  up a major liaison channel, and another channel through our  brother Sa'd Misbah, who was living in Spain. There were  meetings in Europe in which al-Jidak and Qarrum took part with  the Front leadership."    Salim al-Wa'ir says, "The option of an agreement with the  Front gave us added comfort and strength. We saw in their  partnership the only solution for the success of our movement,  because of their capabilities and their international  connections. They were also the strongest faction pursuing the  objective of toppling the regime by any means. They rejected  dialogue with the regime despite all inducements." Salih  believes that "the regime's attacks on the Front and its leaders  made us even more intent on cooperating with them. The  slanderous attacks on Dr. al-Muqaryif made us even more eager to  cooperate with him, despite the constant defamation to which he  was subjected. We have a folk saying in Libya that goes, `You  cannot hide sunshine with a sieve.'"  <H5>  The Goal of the Operation </H5>   'Abd-al-Salam al-Wa'ir continues: "After numerous contacts  and meetings, a plan of action was agreed upon, to be  implemented by spring 1994 at the latest. I agreed with  Bil-Qasim and Qarrum on the broad lines of the plan to topple  the regime and the transitional period. There was one goal: to  overturn the ruling regime and proclaim the establishment of a  constitutional, democratic state, to keep the transitional  period short, between two and three years, and that the head of  state be a civilian during that period. We all agreed to select  Dr. Muhammad Yusuf al-Muqaryif for that job. We also agreed to  delegate responsibilities among ourselves during the  transitional period, in light of the practical contributions of  the groups and persons. Our intention was also linked to the  need to seek the assistance of all patriotic and specialized  technical elements, especially those not deeply involved in the  practices of the current ruling regime."    Salih indicates that the choice of a civilian to head the  government "served the interests of Libya best of all, because  we saw the transitional period as the most delicate in the  process of eliminating the regime. It would bring the country  back to a new starting point. If we did not proceed on  systematic, civilized bases, we might have borne the  responsibility for losing Libya another year."  <H5>  The "Elimination" Operation </H5>   Capt. Salim reveals that the members of the organization  planned out a "communique number one" and a plan of action for  zero hour, without specifying a clear time, pending the  completion of contacts and preparations. He says that the plan  required "rapid, lightning-fast action in Tripoli, and from  there to neighboring large cities, particularly as those  belonging to the organizations ordered basic battalions who had  ammunition and advanced weapons. Under their command were  individuals of proven courage and experience. The units would  move in Tripoli, Banghazi, Misratah (120 km from Tripoli),  Tarhunah (80 km), Sabratah (60 km), and Gharyan (80 km). The  targets were the command headquarters at Bab al-'Aziziyah, the  intelligence department, the Jamahiriyah Security Commission,  and centers of guard brigade concentrations. But the regime  discovered the operation, and we considered speeding it up, to  implement it on 15 October. However, the arrests and  confrontations began on 12 October, which led to the outcome,  which is known."  <H5>  The Regime's Indications </H5>   How did the officers know that the regime had discovered the  operation? In 'Abd-al-Salam al-Wa'ir's words, "there were  several actions on the part of the regime that indicated they  knew something about the military organization. Such as:  stepped-up surveillance of military men, the assignment of new  men into the units, and the consolidation of security units the  regime most depended upon (the Deterrent, the Guards, and the  9th Brigade) headed up by Lt. Col. Mas'ud 'Abd-al-Hafiz,  commander of the staff of the guard; he was appointed chief of  staff. The crossing points on our borders with Egypt and Tunisia  were reviewed. Security passes for the military were revoked, a  brigade of the guards was transferred to Bani Walid, the  intelligence chief Maj. al-Khuwaylidi al-Humaydi made a tour of  the eastern regions, and Colonel al-Qadhdhafi met with relatives  of his among former officers in Sabha. They were resident in  Misratah, and he formed them into committees, because, as  al-Qadhdhafi told them--the first cell of the revolution--in his  speech in September 1993, "no one can play with the lion in his  mouth." Then there was the meeting of the intelligence director  in Tripoli, Jum'ah Bin-Niran, with security officers, in which  he told them that al-Qadhdhafi's words indicated there was a  conspiracy inside the army, and the movement of military units  to agricultural projects."    Capt. Salim says, "We felt uneasy, and we understood that a  counter-plot was being prepared to thwart ours. We contacted the  second organization, and its leader confirmed that his group had  not been penetrated, nor had the third."    'Abd-al-Salam explains his belief that the penetration may  have occurred in the organization "which had recently joined us  because the arrests had concentrated on its members, in one  swoop." Perhaps "the regime got some information about the  action from a foreign source I didn't know about, or maybe there  was some mistake that led to some information leak. Anyway, we  did not retreat--we thought about moving up the appointed day,  to 15 October."  <H5>  The Arrests </H5>   Lt. Col. Salih says, "On 12 October, military intelligence  arrested Col. Miftah Qarrum, Col. Mustafa Bil-Qasim, Maj. 'Ali  al-Kakali, Maj. Khalil al-Jidak, Maj. Ramadan al-'Iyhawri, and  others. A lieutenant colonel was arrested in al-Kufrah and  another in Gharyan, a major in Zuwarah along with nearly 20  civilians. There were some confrontations with officers during  the arrests, and some other units moved in some barracks,  commanded by officers from the organization when they heard of  the regime's movements toward them, and when they learned of the  arrests. Other units blew up an ammunitions dump in Bani Walid,  which is where the most violent clashes took place.  International wire services described these as "the Bani Walid  incidents" or "the Bani Walid mutiny."  <H5>  How They Fled </H5>   How did they escape from Libya? Salih says, "I cannot tell  the whole story, because it would endanger many people. I stayed  in Tripoli for two days, then left via a neighboring country, by  land, and from there to another Arab country. There I learned  that Libyan intelligence had asked its officers to turn me over,  but they refused. Then I met with 'Abd-al-Salam and Salim on a  Mediterranean trip, and we headed for Europe together." He  explained that the authorities arrested his brother, a father of  five, the last of whom, named 'Abd-al-Fattah, had been born only  one month previous.    'Abd-al-Salam and Salim escaped together. They say, "On the  morning of 12 October, we got a telephone call from someone we  knew, speaking cautiously, in code, which led us to phone an  officer in the organization to warn him, or find out his fate.  We went quickly to the homes of some of the organization  members, and found intelligence vehicles in front of the homes.  Then we went to a person we wanted to ask about, and we found  his neighbors and members of his family in a state of anxiety  and confusion, and we realized then that the operation was over."    They add: "Fortunately, our organization had not been  penetrated, for the arrests continued for nearly two months. We  thought of leaving Libya, though, on the same day of the  arrests. We left with only the clothes on our backs, personal  sidearms, and our passports, and crossed the border of a  neighboring country with no problem. Our names had not yet been  flashed to the control posts. From that country we moved on to  an African country, then an Arab country, then a Mediterranean  country. There we met Lt. Col. Salih, and all left for a  European country."    The three officers say that "God is supreme. This was our  fate. We did all we could so that truth may prevail. Now, today,  we are members of the National Front for the Salvation of Libya,  in which we found our brothers-in-arms and in honorable  citizenship, and they are all among the finest of Libya's  citizens."  <H5>  Officers' Trials </H5>   'Abd-al-Salam al-Wa'ir has this to say about the recent  trials of the organization's officers, which were shown on  Libyan television, in which the officers said that they were  spying for America: "This is a scenario we knew about even  before it was shown on television. No one in Libya is fooled by  it. Those are honorable officers, and their history is well  known. If we were agents, we were agents for Libya." He adds:  "And the trials--anyone who followed them saw the clear  contradiction in the prosecutors' claims and questions. One  minute they accused us of wanting to spy against Arab unity;  this is an innovation that occurs only in Libya and on Libyan  television. The next minute they said we were spying on the  man-made river, on behalf of America and the technical  consulting office for the river, which is in America--but its  technicians know every inch of the man-made river. Then they say  we're spying on the al-Rabitah factory, but the regime itself  announced nearly two years ago that a fire destroyed the tool  factory in al-Rabitah; that the factory doesn't exist. Then they  say we're spying on the missile program being developed. But the  regime itself said two years ago that it had no such missiles.  Libyans know very well that interrogations begin with spying  against Arab unity and end with spying on a tool factory. It was  a phony interrogation, in which the officers confessed as the  result of torture. Plus the fact that someone whose mission was  espionage would not go around recruiting these huge numbers of  officers and civilians."</p>

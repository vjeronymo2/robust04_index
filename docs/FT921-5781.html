			<p>920302 FT  02 MAR 92 / Sharp rise in theft insurance payouts: Insurers association says recession may be causing a rise in fraudulent claims THEFT INSURANCE payments rose by more than 60 per cent for domestic properties and 20 per cent for commercial premises to a total of more than Pounds 800m last year, according to figures to be released by the Association of British Insurers next week. The ABI, which represents most UK insurers, will also announce that fire damage payouts last year rose to Pounds 1.02bn, half of which is thought to be due to arson. About Pounds 100m of this, it believes, resulted from policy holders setting fire to their own property to claim insurance money. Other heavy lossmaking categories include theft of and from cars, where claims rose by 50 per cent, and mortgage indemnity policies which compensate lenders for losses when their properties are repossessed. The figures for 1991, described by the ABI as a 'diabolical year' for its members, highlight the background of recession and rising crime against which Royal Insurance and Commercial Union last week announced heavy UK underwriting and pre-tax losses. Results from other insurers in coming weeks are expected to be similarly poor; General Accident, which reports tomorrow, says 1991 was 'pretty horrendous' for UK insurers. Insurers have also noted the public is following the US by becoming more compensation-minded: 'if it moves, sue it' summarises one insurer. People driven by recession into frugality are also making claims when previously they did not bother, and insurers are facing heavy payouts to redundant workers with unemployment protection policies. Faced with increases in legitimate claims, insurers are taking a tougher line on fraud, says the ABI. While last year's fire claim total is just 1 per cent up on 1990 - a decrease after inflation  - the ABI believes fraudulent arson may be rising as businesses continue to struggle. Forensic scientists acting for insurers now sometimes arrive at fires before the flames are doused. The increase in arson has also bred forensic accountants who check the finances of fire-stricken companies. Insurers, who suspect many more cases of fraudulent arson than they can prove, record details of large fires against a checklist, says Mr Nigel Lister, General Accident's UK assistant general manager. Tell-tale signs include: a switched-off fire alarm system, lack of evidence of a break-in, fires which start in several places and at night in an empty building, non-payment of bills by the company and prior removal of stock. Soft-heartedness is a giveaway; a guard dog's unaccustomed absence is significant. In one recent case a London corner-shop owner, desperate about competition from a new superstore, lit rubbish behind the counter, locked up and went home. The shop was destroyed and its owner jailed for 18 months. Some attempts are amateurish; an East Anglian furniture importer burnt down his warehouse before discovering his insurance was not paid up. 'It becomes more difficult when they bring in the professional gangs which are undoubtedly operating around the country,' says Mr Lister. In the past insurers were reluctant to delay payouts: 'claims settlements are our shop window,' says one. Mr Lister says that, where companies now withhold payment because fraudulent arson is strongly suspected, claimants nervous of court hearings often suggest much-reduced settlements. Other arsonists are vandals, thieves, dishonest staff destroying evidence of crime and disgruntled employees.</p>

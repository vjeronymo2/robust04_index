			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / Old wounds re-opened in the fight for funds: Mortgage interest rates may have to rise again soon unless the battle between building societies and the government for investors' funds is resolved THE FIRST signs of the next dispute between building societies and the government over mortgage rates have started to emerge. Societies are warning again that mortgage rates may rise unless the government makes National Savings products less attractive to investors. Mr Andrew Longhurst, chief executive of Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester, led last year's assault on the government that culminated in the temporary withdrawal of the National Savings First Option bond. Yesterday Mr Longhurst was going over some familiar territory again. He said; 'It would only take one major lender to move rates upwards and everybody would shift. That would be another competitive pressure on societies, and we are already squeezed.' However, like other chief executives, Mr Longhurst thinks the battle is likely to be delayed for a few months. The first warning that tensions were about to rise emerged in the Budget when Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, emphasised the role that National Savings would have to play in funding the estimated Pounds 50bn public sector deficit for 1993-94. This role was not calculated to reassure societies, which are already struggling to attract funds. Their net inflow of funds last year was only Pounds 295m, compared to Pounds 5.8bn in 1991. Base interest rate falls have made their savings products less attractive. For the moment, the lack of attractiveness does not matter too much because demand for mortgages is also low. However, any strong upturn in housing demand could create problems for societies since they will lack the retail funding from individual savers to satisfy it. The only way of getting such retail funds would be to raise interest rates. Mr Longhurst has no doubts that mortgage rates would have to rise to support any retail savings rises. He said: 'Retail funds form the basis of our business. They dictate our mortgage rates.' He added that societies would have to attract new funds if they were to help any housing market revival. There are two obstacles to getting retail funds. First, the re-emergence of the First Option bond, now offering 6.34 per cent gross on investments of more than Pounds 1,000. Second, limits on holdings of other National Savings products have been raised.  This includes a five-fold rise in the income bond limit to Pounds 250,000. National Savings products took in a net Pounds 4.1bn in the 11 months to February, compared with Pounds 2.6bn for the same period to February last year. Treasury officials expect National Savings to contribute between Pounds 4bn and Pounds 4.5bn to finance of the Pounds 50bn deficit in the coming financial year. The government has as yet shown few signs of discovering new sources of deficit funding. It has not responded to calls from banks for new short-term gilts to attract their funds. This means the government will be under more pressure this year not to back down over National Savings. There is one short-term alternative for societies: raising their wholesale funds from capital markets. But the paucity of retail funds in the last year means societies have limited capacity before they go over the limits on holdings of wholesale funds set by the Building Societies Commission. The limits average about 30 per cent of assets. Halifax, the largest society, argues that it has plenty of capacity because it was only at 15.2 per cent wholesale funding at the end of January. But Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester is at 25 per cent, and could bring in only Pounds 800m by raising its wholesale funds a further five percentage points. A substantial rise in mortgage demand could therefore bring uncomfortable funding pressure to bear later this year. Mr Adrian Coles, external affairs manager of the Building Societies Association, said: 'If the housing market does recover, it would obviously put some societies under strain.' For now, societies can bear the strain. Mr Jim Birrell, Halifax chief executive, said: 'We do not have a funding problem, but we might be forced to seek alternatives if the mortgage market picks up fast.' All this means that the battle between the government and mortgage lenders is likely to be delayed until later this year, but is unlikely to be avoided altogether. When it comes, the growing deficit means there will be less chance of the government giving in to societies' complaints.</p>

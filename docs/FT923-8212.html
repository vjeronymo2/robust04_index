			<p>920813 FT  13 AUG 92 / International Company News: Northrop sees third-quarter provision NORTHROP, the US defence contractor which is heavily dependent on the B-2 Stealth bomber programme, warned yesterday it expects to make a Dollars 152m provision related to its cruise missile programme in the third quarter. The company said the charge reflected the estimated financial impact of its proposal to extend the schedule to complete the flight test programme of the Tri-Service Standoff Attack Missile. The provision will cut third-quarter earnings by around Dollars 100m or Dollars 2.13 a share, and is being taken after discussion with the US Air Force this month. Northrop claims the provision should be sufficient to complete the development programme.</p>

Citing a study, he pointed out that in 1993 the volume of  international agricultural-livestock trade fell, and this trend  is expected to continue, constituting a shortfall for Mexico,  despite the prospects for growth opened by GATT and NAFTA.    In addition to a drop in global demand prompted by the  demise  of the defunct Soviet Union, the major exporting countries are  maintaining subsidy policies that cause serious distortions in  the international market, pushing prices of most  agricultural-livestock products to their lowest levels in  history.    Once GATT's Uruguay Round agreements and various global  agreements such as NAFTA are consolidated, the distortions in  the market should give way to price increases.    The Mexican situation is not promising. Although 1993's  agricultural-livestock trade deficit ($121.4 million) was lower  than the one for 1992 ($761.4 million), the expanded [ampliada]  agricultural-livestock trade balance presents one of the highest  deficits in history, even higher than for the period of the lost  decade [reference to Latin America's economic problems of the  1980's].    Although some exports are increasing, including legumes,  fresh vegetables, cattle, tomato, fresh fruits, and coffee, the  expanded agricultural-livestock trade balance has reached $2.3  billion.</p>

This incident coincides with the  tension that has been mounting in Libreville since yesterday.  Jean-Claude Franck Medome has the details    [Medome] There is a sudden increase in tension following the  unlimited general strike launched by the Gabonese Free Trade  Unions Confederation [CGSL]. This strike turned into violent  demonstrations characterized by roadblocks and the burning of  tires, public vehicles, and buildings, including a police  station in the second police district in the capital. People  and motorists who tried to go to work were assaulted by  demonstrators. Such sporadic incidents were still noted this  morning, and, in the opinion of the government, this explosion  of wrath is the handiwork of the opposition. The government  says opposition leaders, at a rally over the weekend, called on  their supporters to adhere to the CGSL's call for a general  strike and civil disobedience. This strike call was echoed by  Radio Liberte, the RNB radio that was destroyed early this  morning by security forces.    It is difficult, for the moment, to estimate the extent of  the damage. In the face of the deterioration of the political  and social climate, the government has decided to restore the  state of warning, which is marked notably by a curfew from 2200  to 0530 throughout the country.    [Paris AFP in French in a Libreville-datelined item at 1236  GMT on 22 February adds the following: "Presidential Guard  armored vehicles took up positions in downtown Libreville by  midday, where the state of warning has been in force since  yesterday. Armored vehicles and truckloads of troops of the  Presidential Guard were notably deployed along the boulevard  facing the sea where the Presidential Palace is situated."]</p>

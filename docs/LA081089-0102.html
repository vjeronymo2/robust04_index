			<p><P> August 10, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOME POMONA PROJECTS TO PAY PREVAILING WAGE  </P> <P> Developers of city-assisted redevelopment projects will be required to pay  workers prevailing wages or face fines under a new policy adopted this week by  the City Council.  </P> <P> The resolution, proposed by Councilman C. L. (Clay) Bryant, passed 3 to 2 after  a spate of verbal attacks and accusations were traded among council members.  Bryant and council members Nell Soto and Tomas Ursua voted in favor, and Mayor  Donna Smith and Councilman Mark Nymeyer were opposed.  </P> <P> The prevailing wage refers to the average pay for a particular skill performed  in a certain locality. It is calculated periodically by the state labor  commissioner's office. Pomona is the fifth city in Los Angeles County to  prohibit substandard wages for construction work subsidized by a redevelopment  agency, Deputy City Atty. William Curley said. Monterey Park, Baldwin Park,  Santa Monica and Los Angeles are covered by prevailing wage laws.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Some Limits  </P> <P> Only developers who receive Redevelopment Agency assistance are affected by the  policy. Additionally, the policy would be limited to residential projects of  more than $250,000 and non-residential projects of more than $100,000. It  imposes a $25 fine on developers, contractors and subcontractors for each day  they are found to be in violation of the policy.  </P> <P> "This is so we can get citizens out of living at the poverty level," Soto said  before the council voted. "I have nothing against big business. We need  development in this town. (But) if someone wants to come into Pomona they're  going to come in with prevailing wages whether they like it or not." Soto's  comments were applauded by about 10 people at the meeting.  </P> <P> But Smith said the prevailing-wage rate would only drive developers across the  county line at a time the city is struggling to attract businesses. She added  that she was skeptical of the fact that only four other cities in Los Angeles  County have similar policies, and that only Monterey Park's is almost identical  to Pomona's. The mayor also accused Soto, Ursua and Bryant of bowing to union  demands.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Muscled' by Unions  </P> <P> "If this is such a good thing for Pomona, why aren't other cities jumping on  the bandwagon?" Smith said. "I have nothing against unions -- my father was in  a union -- (but) I've had several meetings with union members and I'm tired of  being muscled by them."  </P> <P> Soto, in turn, leveled her own attacks against Nymeyer, who earlier had said it  was none of the city's business to monitor contractors' payrolls.  </P> <P> "Mr. Nymeyer is still campaigning," Soto responded, pointing to a cable  television camera in the back of the council chambers. "This will not be held  as a campaigning forum for grandstanding."  </P> <P> The state Labor Code and the federal Community Development Block Grant program  already require prevailing wages for work directly funded by city agencies. But  the laws do not cover projects assisted by redevelopment agencies in other  ways, through such means as condemnation and acquisition of property, off-site  improvements or preferential treatment in land sales.  </P> <P> Most large developers in Pomona already offer prevailing wages because they  contract with unions for construction work, Curley said. Although the  resolution takes effect immediately, projects already in the construction phase  will be exempt from the policy, he said.  </P> <P> In other actions Monday night, the council:  </P> <P> Voted 5 to 0 to appoint Bryant as Pomona's representative on the San Gabriel  Valley Mosquito Abatement District Board of Trustees.  </P> <P> Voted 3 to 2 to create a Board of Parking Place Commissioners to oversee all  vehicle parking districts, with Smith and Nymeyer dissenting.  </P> <P> Postponed adoption of developer fees for road and highway improvements, public  safety projects, and traffic signal and control devices.  </P> <P> Voted 5 to 0 to endorse the 1988 South Coast Air Quality Management District  plan for improving regional air quality.  </P></p>

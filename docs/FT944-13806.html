			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / Arts: Today's Television ITV launches a new drama series called Ellington (starring Chris Ellison in the title role, just to be thoroughly confusing) with a 90-minute pilot. We are told that Ellington is a sports promoter and personal manager who 'maintains his integrity and sense of fair play as he battles his way through the corruption'. We are assured that, although he was raised in 'the tough and shady environment of smoke-filled snooker halls and dingy boxing gymnasia' Ellington is 'a survivor'. Well well. Presumably it will be, you know, gritty? (8.30). Yet another documentary about yet another nasty small group on the extreme right wing of British politics: Dispatches investigates an organisation which it says has been linked to the British National Party, 'Combat 18', whose members, it is asserted, make threatening phone calls, smash windows, make death threats, tamper with cars and put offensive material through letter boxes (9.00 C4). The acting in Between The Lines is still good, the writing is competent, but the series has lost its edge since Tony and Harry left the Met (9.30 BBC1).</p>

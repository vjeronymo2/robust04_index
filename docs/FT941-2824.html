			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / International Company News: Banco de Chile share trading suspended Banco de Chile, the country's largest private bank, yesterday became the second company within a week to have trading in its shares suspended after three shareholders filed an injunction against the board of directors. The series A shareholders filed a 'recourse' with the Court of Appeal in an effort to stop Banco de Chile issuing new shares to series B shareholders instead of cash dividends. Lawyers representing the three complainants claim the measure threatened 'fundamental constitutional rights' pertaining to property ownership. The move would inevitably dilute the stake of series A shareholders, who own 9 per cent of the bank. The Superintendencia, the country's banking watchdog, stopped all trading for the rest of the week after Banco de Chile failed to overturn the injunction.</p>

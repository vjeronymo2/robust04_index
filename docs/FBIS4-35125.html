			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ricardo Bonalume Neto and Marcelo Leite] </F>   [Text] While the Ministry of Science and Technology is  attempting to "repair" research in the country, scientists at a  seminar in Sao Paulo were debating the future of the nation's  scientific development (without reaching unanimous conclusions).    Science and Technology Minister Israel Vargas announced that  the new budget proposal in Congress has raised the funds for his  ministry by 6 percent. He considers this increase good, when  compared with the 16 to 20 percent cuts in other areas.    Brazil has again received sizable funds from the World Bank  for the PADCT (Program in Support of Scientific and  Technological Development).    Those funds come from both the Brazilian Government and the  World Bank; but in October 1992, because of the lack of local  matching funds, the country received only 3.8 percent of the  PADCT appropriation.    "The faucet was turned off during the Collor government,"  remarks Vargas. Now, the percentage has returned to a more  appropriate level, on the order of 70 percent, he claims.    The government is also negotiating a loan that could amount  to $300 million or even $400 million. Some of the funds from the  privatizations will go to science as well.    At the opening of the "International Seminar on Evaluation  of  and Proposals for Brazilian Scientific and Technological  Development," at the Getulio Vargas Foundation (FGV), the  minister pointed out that private business firms contribute only  15 percent of the costs of research and development in the  country.    As early as this year, Vargas expects to raise the spending  on science and technology by over $700 million annually.  Brazil's total spending on the sector stands at approximately $3  billion per year. The ministry's budget amounts to $800-$900  million.    The background for the minister's statements consists of  three studies on the status of science in the country, the  purpose of which was to discuss proposals for the sector's  development.    Another point stressed by the minister was the improvement  in  relations with the U.S. Owing to the conflict over the patent  law, the computer science policy, and the construction of the  Brazilian rocket, which the rich countries fear may become a  military missile, the U.S. threatened drastic cuts in the  scientific cooperation with Brazil. The conflict has been  resolved.    Political scientist Simon Schwartzman, of the USP  [University  of Sao Paulo] and FGV, proposes the "associated laboratories"  model, to provide a solid foundation for financing the leading  research groups operating at present.    Schwartzman points to the CNPq's (National Research Council)  estimate that Brazil has nearly 52,000 researchers, but that  only a quarter of them (between 12,000 and 13,000) have  doctorates, and hence are qualified researchers. Another quarter  of that total have only taken a course leading to a degree.  <H5>  Military Research </H5>   Geraldo Lesbat Cavagnari Filho, a professor at Unicamp  [Campinas State University] and colonel in the reserves,  advocated the next federal government's continuation of the  three main military research and development projects.    The three major projects that he cited are the parallel  nuclear program handled by the Navy, the goal of which is the  construction of a nuclear submarine in the country; the  Brazilian Complete Space Mission, including the installation of  a satellite launching rocket by the Air Force; and the  production of the AMX fighter-bomber by Embraer [Brazilian  Aeronautics Company].    According to Cavagnari, all three projects were "mistakes,"  because the country could have found other means for achieving  technological development. However, he thinks that it would be  worse to end them now, when they are beginning to bring results.    According to the Unicamp professor, the dimensions of the  military projects can be gauged by the total cost of the nuclear  submarine project: $2.5 billion in 20 years. The launching of  the submarine is planned for the year 2005.    Another fact demonstrating the sector's importance to the  society: nearly 90 percent of the researchers employed by the  military are civilians, the cost of whose training has been  defrayed largely by the Armed Forces.    Another Unicamp researcher, Renato Dagnino, questions the  supposed financial benefits accrued from military research,  estimating that it consumes 20 percent of the country's total  research and development budget.    Dagnino notes that, in the U.S., military research carries  an  even greater weight (approximately 40 percent), but is more  effective in terms of value of the product. Whereas, in the  U.S., the military industry accounts for 4 percent of the GDP  (gross domestic product), in Brazil, during 1987, that  percentage was only 0.2 (a result 10 times worse in terms of  value of the end product).  <H5>  [Box, p 1-12] </H5> <H5>  Physics in a Critical Situation </H5>   The picture of physics research in Brazil drawn yesterday at  the International Seminar is dismal, as was to be expected. The  physicists think that, to revive it, there must be a break in  its umbilical link with the university.    This viewpoint was upheld by Sergio Machado Rezende, aged  53,  a full professor at the UFPE (Federal University of Pernambuco).  According to Rezende, 84 percent of Brazilians with doctorates  in physics are in universities, and 2 percent are in private  business firms.    In more industrialized countries, nearly a third are in  industry. In the U.S., the proportion amounts to 50 percent.  There are 1,350 holders of doctorates in physics in the  country; and 33,000 in the U.S.    According to Rezende, the only solution is more investment  in  the sector. Whereas industrialized countries apply $50 per  capita annually, here the amount declines to $0.79.</p>

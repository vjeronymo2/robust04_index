			<p><P> December 8, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> TINKER, GANNETT PARTNERSHIP ON TV SHOWS ENDS  </P> <P> Gannett Co. Inc. and television producer Grant Tinker announced they have  terminated their partnership to produce television shows, which resulted in the  ill-fated "USA Today on TV."  </P> <P> Both sides said Thursday they were seeking a new financial backer to replace  Gannett's involvement in GTG Entertainment, as the joint venture is called.  </P> <P> GTG, based in Culver City, was formed in 1987 by Tinker, a former chairman of  NBC, and Gannett, a media company, to produce television programs for networks  and for syndication.  </P> <P> GTG's daily syndicated news program modeled on Gannett's USA Today newspaper  was canceled last month after it received poor reviews and generally low  ratings.  </P> <P> GTG also produces "Baywatch," which has been renewed for this season by NBC.  </P> <P> Sheilah Gibbons, a Gannett spokeswoman, told the New York Times that a mutual  decision was reached to end the partnership.  </P> <P> Neither side offered any specific reason for the decision.  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 7, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EXILED RULERS SUMMON 450 TO TALKS ON KUWAIT'S FUTURE  </P> <P> Kuwait's exiled rulers have invited 450 prominent citizens of their occupied  land to discuss a new type of Kuwait for the time when Iraq eventually  retreats, the emirate's Crown Prince Saad al Abdullah al Sabah said Saturday.  </P> <P> In the meantime, he said, Kuwait refuses to consider any negotiated compromise  that does not involve Iraq's unconditional withdrawal from all Kuwaiti  territory seized Aug. 2.  </P> <P> Saad, who is also prime minister, said Kuwaiti notables will meet in Jidda on  Oct. 13 for three days to discuss the situation and make plans.  </P> <P> "We have this question in our minds, how to rebuild a new Kuwait," he said in  an interview. "It will not be easy. We'll have to work very hard."  </P> <P> Although he was reluctant to elaborate, Saad made it clear that the meeting  would consider issues ranging from defense arrangements to the basic rights of  Kuwaiti citizens and foreign residents.  </P> <P> "After the invasion, we learned many things as Kuwaitis," he said. "We'll have  a new policy for security in the future, closer cooperation with our brothers  in the gulf and with our friends."  </P> <P> Asked about Kuwait's dependence on foreign workers, with few rights or little  attachment to the wealthy state, he said, "We will talk about all of these  things."  </P> <P> Invitations have been sent to exiled Kuwaitis, including present or past  members of the elected legislature, senior diplomats, businessmen, judges,  civil servants, journalists, students and others.  </P> <P> Kuwait's displaced rulers are ensconced at the Al Hada Sheraton, perched  dramatically on a mountaintop at Taif, the Saudi royal family's summer retreat  east of Jidda.  </P> <P> Princes, Cabinet ministers and officials while away their days in the  seven-story hotel, contemplating lush gardens, sipping coffee and fruit juice  and gathering at meal times for sumptuous spreads.  </P></p>

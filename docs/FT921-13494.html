			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / World Trade News: The trains that run on time in war-torn Yugoslavia - An export-oriented joint venture that injects an element of normality into chaos TRAINS still run on time in Yugoslavia, but they are not the ones carrying passengers across the country's six republics. In these times of civil war, almost the entire public transport system has been disrupted, except, that is, for the trains running to and from Germany bearing Volkswagen cars and parts. Mr Bernd Leissner, general director of Tvornica Automobila Sarajevo (TAS), a joint-venture set up 18 years ago between Volkswagen and Unis, a state-owned Bosnian trading company, has for the past six months seen the company's Golf cars and spare parts manufactured in Sarajevo reach their destination, on time and every day. On the wall of Mr Leissner's tidy office just outside Sarajevo, the lively, bustling capital of the Bosnia-Hercegovina republic, are maps showing the train routes to Germany. 'I know every route, every schedule, all the logistics, and all the freight managers,' says Mr Leissner. 'Everything works.' These trains transport 95 per cent of TAS production: 40 wagons wind their way through Yugoslavia every day. Mr Leissner says his success is due to 'communication and good relations. This plant has excellent relations with all the republics. A lot of people are dependent on this plant. War or no war, we keep working. In fact, production is rising.' When Mr Leissner, a German, who joined Volkswagen in 1970, became manager of TAS in October 1990, production was flagging. 'We were producing 120 cars a day, with an annual turnover of about DM500m (Pounds 176m).' Today the company produces 240 cars daily, depending on the availability of supplies, with a post-devaluation turnover value of DM650m. Mr Leissner said: 'In 1990, annual production of cars was 36,000. Last year, production had increased to 38,600. This year, I reckon we will exceed 45,000 and I hope to reach 60,000 by the end of 1993.' In addition TAS produces pick-up trucks. Profit was also increasing, he said, from between DM5m-DM6m in 1990 to DM18m last year. It is good management, Mr Leissner says: 'When I came to Sarajevo, management tools were inadequate. I increased the ratio of German managers to local managers. We now have 23 Germans among the 55 managers. 'Also, the old-style workers' self-management structure was falling apart. I replaced it with a new trade union body. Through training and management programmes, we have created a corporate spirit designed to show the work force that what we had to produce was to be the best quality, fit for world markets.' That was also what he expected from suppliers. 'Despite the war and the political upheaval, all my suppliers are working well. In fact, we have a daughter company in Slovenia. We are now negotiating terms to set one up in Croatia. We are very happy with our suppliers from Serbia.' Mr Leissner admits that half his 3,500 Sarajevo staff are administrative and could be reduced. He recalls the days of 'top-heavy communist bureaucracy' and says remnants of the old nomenklatura still exist on the factory floor. Volkswagen's decision last year to increase its original 49 per cent share to 50 per cent has meant it can make more decisions about production levels and strategy. Not that Unis was in a position to resist: its own financial problems make it completely dependent on TAS for investments. In 1990, TAS allocated DM200m for investments spread over five years, for the launch of the new Golf model later this year, for restructuring, and for increasing exports. About 50 per cent of production is earmarked for the export market, mostly Germany. But Mr Leissner has much greater ambitions: 'This country itself, consisting of 23m people, is a vast market. This is the sixth largest European market for cars. Imagine expanding southwards.' He regards Bosnia-Hercegovina as the ideal bridge between west European markets and Turkey and possibly on to the southern republics of the former Soviet Union. 'We are talking about reaching a market of 200m people,' he said. Meanwhile, Mr Leissner was already confident that, with the launch of the new Golf, the plant could be producing about 150,000 cars a year in five years' time. 'Of course,' he said, 'there are internal problems in the country. The financial infrastructure and instruments, such as banking and auditing do not exist. All the republics need economic laws as quickly as possible.' Nevertheless, Mr Leissner remains the indefatigable optimist: 'Getting the trains to run on time takes up about 20 per cent of my time. But it is worth it.'</p>

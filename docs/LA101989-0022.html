			<p><P> October 19, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> RAISING THE ROOF;  </P> <P> PLAN TO EXTEND FREEWAY INTO OLD NEIGHBORHOOD CALLED CULTURAL SUICIDE  </P> <P> On his lush lawn bordered by beds of asparagus ferns and impatiens in shades of  pink, purple, red and orange, Vern L. Bengtson surveyed the land around  Prospect Circle, where eight lanes of the Long Beach Freeway may one day  traverse South Pasadena.  </P> <P> "The problem is that the whole neighborhood, this beautiful 1920s neighborhood,  would be taken," Bengtson said. "To me, it's cultural suicide to destroy a  glimpse into what represents the best of the architectural past in Southern  California. To indiscriminately tear this down is sinful."  </P> <P> Bengtson, 48, is the director of the Gerontology Research Institute at USC.  Seven years ago, he and his wife bought their two-story Mediterranean Revival  house, with its Italian influences of arched doorways, its columns, porch  balustrades and red roof tiles.  </P> <P> When Bengtson bought the house, it was not in the proposed 6.2-mile path of the  freeway extension. Now it is -- along with 1,425 other houses in Pasadena,  South Pasadena and the El Sereno section of Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Because of the architectural significance of Bengtson's neighborhood, it is  eligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places.  </P> <P> The National Trust for Historic Preservation, citing the freeway plans,  recently designated South Pasadena as one of America's 11 "endangered places."  Within the proposed route are dozens of historic houses. These include houses  designed by internationally known architects Rudolf Schindler and Charles and  Henry Greene.  </P> <P> Officials of the state Department of Transportation say they are sensitive to  the impact the road would have on historical structures and to that end, they  say, Caltrans has developed the least intrusive and best route.  </P> <P> "We're proposing to move and restore all the architecturally distinctive houses  in the path," said Jeffrey Bingham, Caltrans' chief of environmental planning  for Los Angeles and Ventura counties.  </P> <P> However, Bingham said, although the department will negotiate with homeowners  on whether an individual house meets that criterion, perhaps only a few dozen  of the most architecturally and historically significant houses will be moved.  </P> <P> Bengtson's house, with its unpainted concrete exterior and canvas awnings over  the casement windows, is an unlikely candidate.  </P> <P> By any standard, it is a wonderful house, although its designer and builder  were not famous. To Bengtson, the 3,500-square-foot house is a treasure beyond  replacement.  </P> <P> Bengtson explained that the house was typical of upper-middle-class homes when  it was built for $10,000 in 1927. Much of the design and construction, he said,  incorporated elements of the Craftsman school.  </P> <P> "The theme then was bringing the best of craftsmanship to everyone," he said.  </P> <P> But that kind of craftsmanship is expensive today. A similar house on Linda  Vista in Pasadena or in Sierra Madre would be worth at least $900,000, he said.  </P></p>

			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / Survey of Computers in Manufacturing (8): Now 'customer power' rules - Design and manufacturing 'THIS INDUSTRY has suffered because it has been more interested in providing the flashiest system than in looking after its customers,' concedes the marketing director of one top computer-aided design and manufacturing (Cadcam) supplier, writes Colin Macilwain. That is a mistake it can no longer afford. With revenues falling for the second successive year, in an industry used to double-digit growth, suppliers are scrambling to keep customers happy and defend market share. 'Customer power now rules,' says Mr Jon Boyce, UK marketing manager of Computervision, the Massachusetts-based company which leads the UK Cad market. Only five years ago, use of Cad for sophisticated three- dimensional design of parts, though touted at trade shows, was rare in practice. Now it is widespread in medium and large engineering companies. At the Hall Green, Birmingham, plant of Lucas Aerospace, full three-dimensional design and analysis is undertaken before production of the complex aluminium alloy castings which the plant makes for aircraft fuel systems. Mr John McCart, who manages the factory, says: 'In the 1970s, systems were tested in the aircraft. In the 1980s it was done on the testbed. In the 1990s it will happen on the drawing board.' To take a design from concept to service, he says his military customers used to allow up to 10 years and civil customers five or six years. Now that is falling from three to two years and will be compressed still further. Since the first use of Cad at Hall Green 10 years ago, the number of people working in the design office has fallen from 85 to 25 - with a largerthroughput. And the recent adaption of 3-D design and analysis has cut development times by 40 per cent. But new forms of computer-aided engineering now coming to the fore could have an even more dramatic impact on design practice. The most important are parametric design and knowledge-based engineering. Broadly speaking, parametric design allows engineers to stretch and compress designs virtually at will, without having to reset dimensions individually. The technique is now offered by all major suppliers, but its use remains restricted, since designers need to adjust their ways of working to exploit it fully. Knowledge-based engineering remains in its infancy, although a dozen or so large British engineering firms are experimenting with systems from the main specialist suppliers, ICAD and Wisdom. While conventional Cad merely automates the designer's ability to draw straight lines and circles, knowledge-based engineering is more ambitious. By attempting to record and replicate the thought processes which a designer habitually employs, it could open the way for a far higher level of automation in the design process. Work by Lotus Engineering at Norwich has already shown how knowledge-based engineering can enable the speedy design of car chassis parts using a process, called hydroforming, which was once ruled out by metal-bashers as simply too difficult to design for. But the more immediate obsession of many who use it has shifted from the technology itself to the mundane task of keeping track on the data which it generates. Most large manufacturing firms find themselves confronting a growing mountain of design data. Responsibility for every design change needs to be accurately allocated to somebody. For the big suppliers, engineering data management is becoming as important a source of income as selling new systems. The large established suppliers all now see themselves as 'strategic partners' of their customers. As Mr David Punter, marketing director of EDS Unigraphics, puts it: 'The difference will be in the way the customer buys: there will be a market for commodity Cadcam, and a market for strategic partners.' Half-a-dozen established suppliers - EDS, IBM, Computervision, Intergraph, Hewlett- Packard and SDRC - hoped to secure the lion's share of this 'strategic' business. But their grip is under threat from a team of Computervision defectors, who won venture capital backing to found Parametric Technology Corporation (PTC) four years ago. PTC reckoned a parametric system designed from scratch could better exploit modern computer workstations and software development techniques. Last month, it shook the Cad world by winning a Dollars 40m order from Caterpillar, the US construction group. Mr Andy Campbell, PTC's UK manager, claims his company will sell around 5,000 new systems worldwide this year. However, rivals say that PTC will soon encounter the problems they face. Meanwhile, Computervision's grip on the UK Cadcam market - where PTC has made little impact so far - looks relatively secure.</p>

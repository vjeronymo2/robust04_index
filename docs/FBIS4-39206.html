			<p>BFN     [Text] Tbilisi, June 6 (SNARK)--Rezo Adamia, secretary of  the Georgian Parliament Commission on Defence and National  Security told SNARK today Georgia insists on joint command over  Russian military bases, stationed in Georgia. In his opinion,  the command over the Russian bases should be implemented on  coordination with Commander- in-Chief of Georgian Army.    Besides, we suggest that in the Russian troops, should also  serve Georgians, but the Russian side is very suspicious in this  question. Among the serious discords at the negotiations is also  the problem of the terms of the troops' staying. Russia insists  on the term of 25 years, but Rezo Adamia considers that the  agreement should be signed for 5 years. It will allow to revise  it and to move necessary amendments every 5 years. "We should  follow the example of the American bases in Philippines," said  the MP.</p>

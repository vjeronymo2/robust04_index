			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / Senior Polish finance officials ready to quit POLAND IS facing the loss of senior finance ministry officials which could undermine economic policy planning at a crucial time for Mr Jan Olszewski's new centre-right government. An IMF delegation is due in Warsaw next week to discuss economic policies being formulated by the new Polish economic team led by Mr Jerzy Eysymontt, who heads the Central Planning Office. Three senior officials who helped prepare the IMF-backed stabilisation package associated with Mr Leszek Balcerowicz, the former finance minister, have said they want to resign while the government is still working on a draft budget for the last nine months of this year. The budget has been delayed for at least two weeks and will now not be be ready until the end of February. The three officials are Mr Stefan Kawalec, who came to the finance ministry with Mr Balcerowicz, Mr Andrzej Podsiadlo, first deputy minister, and Mr Wojciech Misiag, a ministry veteran who is directly responsible for putting the budget together. All worked closely with Mr Balcerowicz, who was dropped from the government and replaced as finance minister by Mr Karol Lutkowski. The government, meanwhile, has announced the formation of a social economic committee, reporting to the cabinet, in an effort to streamline decision-making. It will be chaired by Mr Eysymontt and will include the finance and labour ministers and the central bank governor. Poland has been without the latter since Mr Grzegorz Wojtowicz was sacked last August following a financial scandal. Mr Eysymontt, a critic of the previous government's tough fiscal and monetary policies, recently admitted that his plans to halt Poland's recession were limited by the need to guard against renewed inflation. He has toned down optimism that the decline in state sector industrial sales - down 40 per cent in two years - could be reversed this year. He now hopes sales will stop falling by the end of the year, with growth resuming in 1993.</p>

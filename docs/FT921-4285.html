			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / International Company News: Court allows TWA to sell routes to USAir TRANS World Airlines, the troubled carrier owned by Mr Carl Icahn, yesterday successfully sought permission from the US bankruptcy courts to sell its international routes between the US cities of Baltimore and Philadelphia and London, to USAir, another large US airline, writes Nikki Tait in New York. The Dollars 50m sale was opposed by the City of St Louis, where TWA has its main hub, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation and the TWA pilots union. The PBGC and the Air Line Pilots Association argued the sale should not go ahead before a clear business plan for the distressed carrier, which filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, was formulated. But the TWA creditors' committee gave its backing to the deal, subject to some provisions over how the proceeds could be used. The USAir deal still requires approval from the Department of Transportation, although USAir said it hopes to start serving the routes into Gatwick, in May.</p>

Reclassified Hospitals_Budget Neutrality Adjustment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 1886(d)(8)(B) of the Act provides that certain rural hospitals are deemed urban effective with discharges occurring on or after October 1, 1988. In addition, section 1886(d)(10) of the Act provides for the reclassification of hospitals based on determinations by the Medicare Geographic Classification Review Board (MGCRB). Under section 1886(d)(10) of the Act, a hospital may be reclassified for purposes of the standardized amount or the wage index, or both.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Prior to FY 1995, section 1886(d)(8)(D) of the Act required the Secretary to adjust the urban standardized amounts so as to ensure that total aggregate payments under the prospective payment system after implementation of the provisions of sections 1886(d)(8)(B) and (C) and 1886(d)(10) of the Act were equal to the aggregate prospective payments that would have been made absent these provisions. The rural standardized amounts were also adjusted to ensure that aggregate payments to rural hospitals not affected by these provisions neither increased nor decreased as a result of these provisions. Beginning October 1, 1994, the Secretary is required to adjust the standardized amounts by the same factor to account for the effects of reclassification. We applied an adjustment of 0.993814 to ensure that the effects of reclassification are budget neutral.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The adjustment factors are applied to the standardized amounts after removing the effects of the FY 1994 budget neutrality adjustment factors. We note that the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FY 1995 adjustments reflect wage index and standardized amount reclassifications approved by the MGCRB or the Administrator as of March 14, 1994. The effects of any additional reclassification changes resulting from appeals and review of the MGCRB's decisions for FY 1995 or from a hospital's request for the withdrawal of a reclassification request will be reflected in the final budget neutrality adjustment required under section 1886(d)(8)(D) of the Act and published in the final rule for FY 1995.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> c. Outliers. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 1886(d)(5)(A) of the Act provides that, in addition to the basic prospective payment rates, payments must be made for discharges involving day outliers and may be made for cost outliers. Under section 1886(d)(3)(B) of the Act, the Secretary has been required to separately reduce the urban and rural national standardized amounts by the proportion of estimated total DRG payments attributable to outliers in each respective area. Beginning with FY 1995, section 1886(d)(3)(B) requires the Secretary to adjust both the large urban and other national standardized amounts by the same factor to account for the estimated proportion of total DRG payments made to outlier cases. Section 1886(d)(9)(B)(iv) of the Act requires that the urban and other standardized amounts applicable to hospitals in Puerto Rico be reduced by the proportion of estimated total DRG payments attributable to estimated outlier payments. Furthermore, section 1886(d)(5)(A)(iv) of the Act directs that outlier payments in any year may not be less than 5 percent nor more than 6 percent of total payments projected or estimated to be made based on the prospective payment rates.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 13501(c) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (Public Law 103&hyph;66) amended section 1886(d)(5)(A) with respect to outliers beginning in FY 1995. With regard to cost outliers, section 13501(c) of Public Law 103&hyph;66 requires that the Secretary modify the methodology for determining the cost outlier threshold. For discharges occurring before October 1, 1994, a hospital may receive payment for a cost outlier if the adjusted costs for a discharge exceed a fixed multiple of the DRG payment for the case or a fixed dollar amount. Effective for discharges occurring on or after October 1, 1994, a hospital may receive payment for a cost outlier if adjusted costs exceed the DRG prospective payment rate plus a fixed dollar amount. As discussed in section IV.D of the preamble, we refer to this revised cost outlier threshold as ``fixed loss.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 13501(c) of Public Law 103&hyph;66 also amended section 1886(d)(5)(A) of the Act with respect to day outliers. Beginning with FY 1995, section 1886(d)(5)(A) requires the Secretary to reduce the proportion of total outlier payments paid under the day outlier methodology. Under the requirements of section 1886(d)(5)(A)(v), the proportion of outlier payments made under the day outlier methodology, relative to the proportion of outlier payments made under the day outlier methodology in FY 1994 (which we estimated at 31.3 percent in our September 1, 1993 final rule (58 FR 46348)), shall be 75 percent in FY 1995, 50 percent in FY 1996 and 25 percent in FY 1997. After September 30, 1997, the Secretary will no longer pay for day outliers under the provisions of section 1886(d)(5)(A)(i). Again, the changes required by section 1886(d)(5)(A) are discussed in detail in section IV.D of the preamble to this proposed rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> i. FY 1995 Outlier Thresholds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For FY 1994, the day outlier threshold is the geometric mean length of stay for each DRG plus the lesser of 23 days or 3.0 standard deviations. The marginal cost factor for day outliers (or the percent of Medicare's average per diem payment paid for each outlier day) is equal to 55 percent in FY 1994. The cost outlier threshold is the greater of 2.0 times the prospective payment rate for the DRG or $36,000 ($33,000 for hospitals that have not yet entered the prospective payment system for inpatient capital-related costs). The marginal cost factor for cost outliers (or the percent of costs paid after costs for the case exceed the threshold) is 75 percent. We applied an outlier adjustment to the FY 1994 standardized amounts of 0.945960 for the urban rates, 0.977157 for the rural rates, and 0.9454 for the capital Federal rate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For FY 1995, we propose to set the day outlier threshold at the geometric mean length of stay for each DRG plus the lesser of 22 days or 3.0 standard deviations. We are also proposing to reduce the marginal cost factor for each outlier day from 55 percent to 49 percent in FY 1995.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Our proposed policy will reduce the proportion of outlier payments paid to day outliers as required by section 1886(d)(5)(A) of the Act. We are also proposing a fixed loss cost outlier threshold in FY 1995 equal to the prospective payment rate for the DRG plus $23,300 ($21,400 for hospitals that have not yet entered the prospective payment system for capital-related costs). Additionally, we are proposing to increase the marginal cost factor for cost outliers from 75 to 80 percent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

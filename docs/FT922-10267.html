			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / US threatens EC with punitive tariffs over oilseed subsidies THE US yesterday threatened to impose punitive tariffs on Dollars 1bn (Pounds 565m) worth of annual imports from the European Community for its refusal to comply with a General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) panel ruling against the EC's new oilseed subsidy regime. Mr Rufus Yerxa, deputy US trade representative, said in Geneva that the US had been patient but given 'the EC's failure to offer an acceptable resolution today, we have no choice but to initiate this action.' The European Commission described the US action as 'totally without justification' and 'counter-productive and inappropriate', because Brussels had promised to table a compromise solution to Gatt by June. A formal Commission statement complained the US action lacked 'any legal basis', because the Gatt council had yet to accept the findings of its oilseeds panel. The dispute risks souring already difficult negotiations on farm subsidies in the stalled Uruguay Round of Gatt trade talks. The US action would raise tariffs on Dollars 1bn of EC exports to the US. The Community exported Dollars 4.7bn of farm exports to the US, and imported Dollars 7.15bn of US agricultural produce, in 1990. Details of the US sanctions will be published shortly. Any measures would seek to price targeted European products out of the US market. Brussels' proposed change is to tie aid to EC oil seeds growers to a requirement that they must take 15 per cent of their arable land out of production. This 'set aside' provision should mollify US objections by giving more scope for imports, EC officials said. The EC told Gatt's governing council, which discussed the second Gatt ruling against the EC subsidies for the first time yesterday, that it could not accept the report immediately but would submit a 'concrete proposal' for settling the long-standing dispute before the next council meeting. This is tentatively scheduled for mid-June. Under Gatt procedures, retaliation must be sanctioned by all 103 members and it is unheard of for reprisals to be threatened on a 'first reading' of a panel report.</p>

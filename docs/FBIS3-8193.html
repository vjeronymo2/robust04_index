			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Slovak President Michal Kovac by Jan </F> Forowicz; place and date not given: "We Have Avoided Social  Tension and Strikes"]    [Excerpts] [Forowicz] When will Polish-Slovak relations  shape themselves in the way they should in view of our  geographic and linguistic proximity? Poland's involvement in  Slovak trade is barely 2.4 percent. When will all of the  declarations be implemented about improving this state of  affairs and about the desire for cooperation?    [Kovac] I am sure that this has already begun. My first  historic visit--and I do not hesitate to describe it thus--to  Warsaw at the invitation of President Walesa in January was the  first step that brought very concrete results. I also spoke to  politicians and economists. Among other things, I visited the  Polish Business Center Club in the Lubomirski Palace, where you  have your officers' club.    When one bakes bread, one starts with the dough. Poland is  the first partner with which we have developed genuinely  practical cooperation in combating economic crime.    Fourteen Polish-Slovak deals are waiting to be signed by  Prime Minister Pawlak during his visit to Bratislava, which has  been scheduled for April. These mainly involve an  intensification of cooperation, but one of them is an agreement  on avoiding double taxation and another deals with the  protection of investment. [passage omitted]    [Forowicz] The present process of democratization does not  make it easy for our countries to appear as stable countries  worthy of quickly joining Western security structures.    [Kovac] It is quite normal for countries such as ours to  have to adapt themselves. But, if we want to join NATO soon, we  must show that we are a partner that one can depend on. It is  essential to show that a potential NATO member has no quarrels  with its neighbors and is pursuing a stable domestic policy. It  is worth underlining how important it is for our countries'  image to have such initiatives as the Visegrad Group, a group of  countries that are friendly toward one another and are trying to  tighten their cooperation.    [Forowicz] What universal message would you have for the  soldiers and politicians concerned with the defense capability  of Poland and Slovakia?    [Kovac] The armies of both of our countries are also  experiencing a period of change. Nevertheless, they are  presenting their countries' defense potential.    Unfortunately, a situation has arisen in which the Army  reforms must take place at a time of a shortage of funds. Added  to this are the costly commitments brought on by Partnership for  Peace [PFP].    Everything requires a lot of discipline and patriotism and  an  ability to extract the maximum effect from relatively meager  funds. That is why we need excellent and rational leaders now  more than ever. We need military men who speak foreign  languages. Leaders are required who set an example of  professional conduct to the people under their command. Thanks  to people with such qualities, I expect each of our armies will  strengthen its morale.</p>

			<p>931011 FT  11 OCT 93 / Can Yeltsin be a democrat and a reformer? HAVING seized power by eliminating the core group of opponents to his economic programme, Russia's President Boris Yeltsin must now decide how to use it. His first instinct seems to be to press ahead with parliamentary elections in December. But Mr Yeltsin knows both that the state of the economy wins elections, and that the Russian economy is not in good shape. Hence his dilemma: delaying elections may threaten his political legitimacy; pressing ahead with elections quickly may prevent him from implementing the kind of radical economic reforms upon which his political future depends. This is a subject on which officials from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund are required to keep quiet. Publicly, they have no views about the desirability of different political regimes. But the combined experiences of the IMF and the World Bank must have taught them some lessons about the links between economic outcomes and the nature of political regimes. The first lesson seems to be that there is no discernible relationship between economic growth and political regime. China has posted faster growth rates over the past decade and achieved a much larger rise in literacy than India, one of the world's oldest democracies. But Poland has managed both to revive its economy and manage a transition to democracy, neither of which has occurred in authoritarian Romania. Zaire does not suggest authoritarianism is good for growth, but nor do Kenya, Zimbabwe or Nigeria suggest that multi-party elections deliver economic recovery. A more systematic examination of the relationship between growth and democracy conducted by John Helliwell at the US National Bureau of Economic Research fits this anecdotal view. In a sample of 98 countries over the period 1960 and 1985, he finds that countries with higher levels of income per head are more likely to be democracies, but that democracies do not tend to grow either faster or slower than non-democracies.* Yet Russia's situation is a little more delicate: before it can worry about growth, Mr Yeltsin's government must first stabilise the economy's rapid inflation rate. But will elections help? Stabilising a monthly inflation rate of 20 per cent should improve the lot of millions of Russians. But the corollary of a successful stabilisation is likely, at least in the short term, to mean a rise in unemployment from less than 1 to perhaps considerably more than 10 per cent. The World Bank did, in fact, examine the links between successful IMF stabilisation programmes and political regime a few years ago. The results, buried deep in the 1991 World Development Report, are reproduced in the chart. Success is measured by the number of years in which fiscal deficits, central bank credit growth or government spending fell. The analysis suggests that there is little to choose between continuous democratic or authoritarian regimes: credit growth falls about 60 per cent of the time in both cases. But the chances of successful stabilisation were much lower in countries which only recently made the transition to democracy, presumably because political allegiances were more fluid and governments more anxious to deliver signs of progress. This tension between political transition and economic stabilisation is not only a dilemma for Mr Yeltsin. The G7 governments probably have little option but to link aid to democratic reform in Russia. But, as IMF or World Bank officials may whisper in their ears, that does not necessarily imply that democratic elections, as opposed to the promise of them, must be a precondition for either aid or reform. Ghana, one of Africa's most successful reformers, waited 10 years between stabilisation and multi-party elections. And, as Mr Yeltsin may reflect, these were won by the erstwhile dictator, Flight Lieutenant Jerry Rawlings. * Working paper 4066, May 1992. NBER, 1050 Mass.

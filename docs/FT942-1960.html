			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / Japan greets recovery signs with caution: Gerard Baker on a spring spurt that has fizzled out by summer three times before For the fourth year in a row, Japan's economy has started the year with a spurt. In each of the last three years, the spring surge has quickly given way to a summer slump, however, and analysts greeted yesterday's figures with caution, anxious not to be embarrassed yet again by premature predictions of recovery. But the economic signals have been more encouraging for longer this time and hints from the government's Economic Planning Agency yesterday suggested that the second quarter of 1994 would demonstrate that the recovery is being sustained. If growth continues in the second quarter, it will be the first time for three years that gross domestic product has grown for two consecutive quarters. A small achievement, but it would start to look like a trend. But what sort of a recovery will it be? The strength and duration of the upturn will depend entirely on the extent to which output has been lost during the current recession - the output gap, or the difference between long-term productive capacity and actual output. Japan has been used to rapid growth, punctuated by brief, shallow recessions, but these days in Tokyo it is hard to find much optimism about the country's long-term prospects. In the 1950s and 1960s Japan registered average annual growth rates (measured from peak to peak of successive business cycles) of a remarkably consistent 8 to 9 per cent. The first oil shock in 1973 halved that, however, and average annual growth had slowed by the early 1980s to about 4 per cent. There is little doubt that the salad days of the Japanese economy are over. The decline is principally the result of economic maturation. In the 1950s and 1960s, starting from a low base, Japan's economy grew rapidly. There were plentiful supplies of capital, and industry was able to import vast quantities of modern technology that would have taken the country years to develop indigenously. 'For most of the period Japan was able to grow fast because it was in the process of catching up,' says Mr Hirohiko Okumura, chief economist at Nomura Research Institute in Tokyo. 'Now that it has caught up there is little scope for those rates of growth.' If Japan is now a mature economy is it condemned to US or even European rates of growth of around 2 to 3 per cent a year? Two factors will influence Japan's long-term growth prospects: productivity and an ageing population. It is widely believed that both factors work against Japan. Few would argue that it would be able to maintain its rapid rate of increase in manufacturing productivity compared with most industrialised economies, the key to Japan's post-war economic boom. The labour force is projected to peak in the late 1990s and fall sharply thereafter as Japan's ageing population ensures that the number of people above working age grows rapidly in the first part of the 21st century. On this view the economy cannot any longer expect to achieve faster growth than its competitors. But this is a gloomy view, typical of the saturnine outlook often associated with business at this stage of the cycle. The key area for future productivity increases is not manufacturing, which now accounts for just a third of Japan's output, but services. While it is true that manufacturing productivity has reached western levels, services productivity lags well behind - by as much as 50 per cent in some sectors, according to a recent study by McKinsey, the management consultants. As Mr Geoffrey Barker, chief economist at Baring Securities in Tokyo points out, 'if the Japanese service sector can achieve the same sort of productivity improvements seen in manufacturing, the growth potential for the whole economy is enormous'. The scope for deregulation and increased competition in the services sector could, some economists feel, produce significant productivity gains. The contraction of the labour force expected after the late 1990s may also be illusory. The EPA's prognosis is based on the size of the population aged between 15 and 60. But the labour force is actually likely to grow, since more women will work and the retirement age may well recede as labour becomes scarce. The striking aspect of Japanese performance in the last 20 years has been not a straight-line fall in long-run growth that could be explained by maturation, but a single step down after the 1973 oil shock. Since then, the average growth rate has been consistent at slightly more than 4 per cent. If that continues, the implications for the next few years are considerable. The output gap would be close to 10 per cent of gross domestic product and Japan's economy would have room to grow at 5 per cent a year until the end of the century before the gap was closed - a spritely performance for a mature economy.</p>

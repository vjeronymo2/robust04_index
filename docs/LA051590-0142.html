			<p><P> May 15, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ARCHITECT WANTS OTHERS TO SEE THE FIELD AS ART;  </P> <P> EDUCATION: EUGENE RAY, WHO TEACHES AT SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY, STRESSES THE  NEED FOR CREATIVITY.  </P> <P> One of the most provocative and least visible local architects is Eugene Ray,  head of the environmental design program at San Diego State University for 20  years.  </P> <P> Ray, a multidisciplinary thinker in the tradition of R. Buckminster Fuller,  hasn't found widespread acceptance for his ideas, yet he remains committed to  new materials, forms based on nature, a sensitivity to the environment and also  to his strong belief that each project is a chance to invent something new.  </P> <P> He is a veteran advocate for architecture as art, for buildings that serve a  higher purpose than solving functional problems.  </P> <P> That explains why the graduate and undergraduate programs in environmental  design at San Diego State are part of the art department.  </P> <P> "I've always felt art departments were the more creative places," said Ray, who  noted with pleasure that Los Angeles architect Frank Gehry turned down a  position as dean of the architecture school at USC a few years back when  administrators wouldn't move it to the art department.  </P> <P> Like many of his peers on the cutting edge, Ray has found much of his praise  abroad, in Japanese design journals such as A+U and Domus, and in exhibitions  such as the 1985 Paris Biennale.  </P> <P> "You'll find that there is a broader appreciation of design in places like  Italy, Japan and France," said Ray, a compact, humble man who doesn't get  overtly emotional about the slights he's felt in his own country. "There isn't  this hesitancy to try something new simply because it's new."  </P> <P> Ray's large classroom and adjacent office are filled to the rafters with  drawings, models, books, magazines and other items collected during his career.  </P> <P> Looking at the artifacts, you sense a different aesthetic at work. Ray's  commitment to non-rectilinear forms extends to the way he displays colorful  architectural drawings and photographs -- on sheets with rounded edges he trims  with a coffee can.  </P> <P> He believes that curves are more soothing than angles. Cones and spheres make  the most pleasing environments for humans, he says, partly because they  minimize the impact of electromagnetic radiation.  </P> <P> Ray's lectures ramble freely over many disciplines, from art to architecture to  pop culture to the recent Earth Day -- he and his students built a dome from  recycled carpeting tubes for the on-campus celebration.  </P> <P> "I'm interested in improving realities," he tells a small group of  environmental design students gathered to hear one of his talks. "Movies show a  reality above and beyond real life. Our goal is to make real life as exciting  as movies."  </P> <P> The projects he and his young proteges dream up have assorted domes,  combinations of spheres and cones, houses with walls made of compacted earth,  frameworks built from PVC pipe, lightweight environments of thin, taut fabric,  prototypes for housing using new materials being pioneered by the Japanese.  </P> <P> Ray's design philosophies are broader-based than most. He was talking about the  environment and energy conservation before the first Earth Day. He sees a  personal significance in the fact that the Whole Earth Catalog -- a bible of  '60s alternative living -- won a Pulitzer Prize in 1969, the year he came to  San Diego State.  </P> <P> His conversations are peppered with terms he has either invented or picked up  from visionaries such as Fuller: radiant architecture (which takes into account  light, color and electromagnetic radiation), synergetic environments (which  combine elements in such a way that the sum is greater than the parts),  biomorphic (designs based on nature) and biotronics (a happy marriage between  biomorphic forms and electromagnetic radiation).  </P> <P> In recent years, he's been more of an academic than a practicing architect, but  he has a lengthy resume of building credits dating back to the houses he  designed in New Orleans -- his hometown -- after he earned a master's in  architecture from Tulane University.  </P> <P> "Silver Ship" is what he calls his home on Nautilus Street in La Jolla, which  clings to its steep hillside like a space station, or, as Ray would probably  prefer it described, a large living organism. Canopies resemble eyelids, curved  windows on hinges flap up and down like wings. Using economical yet  eye-catching materials such as corrugated aluminum, Ray built it over several  years, with the help of students, at a cost of $40,000.  </P> <P> He still finds time for the occasional design job. Students are collaborating  with him on a master plan and building designs for Madre Grande, an alternative  community in Dulzura in East County. A Native Indian Cultural Center with a  tent-like conical form awaits a San Diego site and funding. And Ray's  lightweight fiberglass covers for an archeological excavation in Presidio Park  are also waiting for funding.  </P> <P> Although Ray's designs often seem futuristic or even timeless, completely  outside architecture's mainstream, he is also committed to architectural  history. He's written letters and reports in favor of saving such local  landmarks as architect R.M. Schindler's El Pueblo Ribera apartments in La  Jolla.  </P> <P> Several of Ray's students have gone on to productive careers in architecture or  other design-related fields, even though his lack of emphasis on such practical  matters as drafting and management can leave them scrambling for supplemental  education once they graduate.  </P> <P> "His classes were eye-opening," said San Diego architect Kotaro Nakamura, who  earned a master's degree under Ray and is now a fellow professor at the  university. "I had strict engineering training in Japan. Eugene opened my  creative side, and I owe him a lot."  </P> <P> "The program was so loose that it didn't constrict me," said local artist Mario  Lara, best known for his temporary architectural installations. "I was  encouraged to go in my own direction, as opposed to other programs, where they  make you fit a cookie cutter and you get squeezed out the other end."  </P> <P> With energy conservation, low-cost housing, and environmental concerns all  coming belatedly into the limelight, San Diegans, especially architects, could  do well to take another look at Ray's ideas.  </P> <P> His buildings are unconventional and not elegant in traditional ways, but his  concern for humanistic values over materialistic ones seems more timely than  ever.  </P></p>

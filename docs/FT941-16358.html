			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / Gas price rise hits big users British Gas is to raise the price of one and two-year interruptible gas contracts by an average 6 per cent from next month, David Lascelles writes. Interruptible contracts enable large consumers to buy gas at cheaper rates. They do so in the knowledge that they might be cut off at short notice. There are about 1,000 customers in the interruptible market, some of them the largest gas consumers in the country, including power stations. Mr Norman Blacker, director of the UK gas business, said factory gate prices had increased by 9 per cent over the past two years, but interruptible prices had fallen by more than 25 per cent in real terms since British Gas was privatised in 1986. 'It is important that our prices in this market become more cost-reflective,' he said.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hindi </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Time To Say: `So Be It'"] </F>   [Text] The fact has been reestablished that Pakistan will  not refrain from interfering in Kashmir. The world is moving  toward peace; if Pakistan's intentions are really peaceful, it  should not have rejected India's six proposals without any  contemplation or reflection. Although no official response has  been received from Pakistan, the way and the impetuousness with  which Pakistani Foreign Secretary Shaharyar Khan rejected the  proposals -- telling the press they said nothing about the  important and key issue of Kashmir -- shows that Pakistan's  claim that it does not assist terrorists in India is a white lie.    At least two of India's proposals are historic. First, India  said that peace should be maintained at the Kashmir line of  control. Without relinquishing their claims, both sides should  -- as an interim measure -- accept it as the genuine line of  control. India's second historic proposal was that neither  country should be the first to use nuclear weapons.    Pakistan argues that recognizing the line of control as the  genuine line of control would be tantamount to accepting the  status quo ante, which runs counter to Benazir Bhutto's  pronouncement in a recent address to the nation that Kashmir  will one day be a part of Pakistan. Obviously, if Pakistan does  not accept this proposal, it means that it considers Kashmir to  be its own. To realize this aim, Pakistan is assisting  terrorists in Kashmir and sending in infiltrators and  mercenaries. India should understand the implications of this  and expose Pakistan at the international level. Pakistan objects  to the proposal rejecting first use of the nuclear bomb because  it wants to keep this option open in the context of Kashmir.  Now, when you have reached an accord on not attacking each  other's nuclear installations, why should this proposal  rejecting the first use of nuclear weapons pose a predicament?  Pakistan's intentions are definitely dubious, and it wants to  intimidate India. It is with the aim of intimidating India that  repeated disclosures have been made that Pakistan has already  manufactured a nuclear device. Now why would India -- which  carried out a nuclear explosion in Pokharan in 1974 -- be  intimidated by such threats?    The best scenario would be for good sense to prevail in  Pakistan and for it to accept India's revolutionary proposals.  Otherwise, the United States will become active again and  harass both countries. It is said that India and Pakistan were  on the verge of a nuclear war in 1990, which the United States  averted through its able diplomacy. The United States will not  repeat this action in the name of charity. This time it will  want to exercise control over both countries.    Pakistan is not stopping its mischief in Kashmir. Fresh  evidence has come from what happened yesterday. Pakistan  carried out a rocket attack on civilian areas in the Punch  sector, injuring 27 people. Similar attacks have been carried  out for three days in a row. A bomb was found near the line of  control that exploded when touched, injuring many school  children. The time has come for a limited response to the  Pakistani attacks. On 1 February, Benazir Bhutto is going to  make venomous statements at the UN Human Rights Commission in  Geneva about so-called human rights violations in Kashmir.    All of this means that Pakistan is engaged in a campaign to  destroy India by all three means -- intentions, words, and deeds  -- and does not want a dialogue. Therefore, we should be able  to say: "So be it."  *</p>

			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / Personal View: An agenda for full employment When I was elected general secretary of the Trades Union Congress 10 months ago I was able to set as one of the organisation's principal objectives helping to raise full employment in the UK to the top of the political agenda. Tomorrow we take a step towards that objective when the TUC and the Employment Policy Institute, the independent think tank, host a conference that brings together the employment spokesmen of the three main political parties with the director general of the Confederation of British Industry and other key figures, including representatives of the unemployed themselves. None of us underestimates the scale of the task. And I am sure all will acknowledge that full employment is unlikely to be achieved in one country alone, not least one as dependent on international trade as the UK. But there are some things which can be done to set us in the right direction. For a start I believe there is some more room for discretionary management of demand. The economy needs to grow above the 2.5 per cent trend to get unemployment down. We cannot create 3m jobs by demand management alone and there are obvious constraints on national action, but I do believe that this recently neglected weapon of economic management can play a substantial role. The conditions are now favourable with low inflation, excess capacity and European recovery picking up. However, at the heart of any policy for full employment has to lie a strong international trading sector. Without successful competitive companies we shall not be able to raise living standards and deliver quality public services. In Britain, we do have some highly competitive companies. Almost invariably they pay well, train well and have good industrial relations based on an established relationship with trade unions. Some, like Rover, have turned themselves round in recent years with the help of the workforce. The first task then is to learn from these companies, to spread best practice in terms of training, industrial relations and the high standards of health and safety which also characterise the best companies. But we cannot rely on the competitive sector alone. If we do, there is a serious danger of reinforcing the growing social divisions with a well rewarded group of insiders, a growing number of working poor and a large pool of unemployed. It has been argued that one means of filling the jobs gap is for the working poor and jobless to lower their expectations and with them their wage rates. Pricing people into jobs has been tried over the past 15 years and the results are today's unacceptable divisions. In the interests of social stability we cannot afford to widen the gap between the insiders and the rest. The obstacle to full employment is not just the number out of work but the number of people out of work for a long period of time. As unemployment has fallen in recent months the number out of work for a year or more has not come down with it. Practical measures to help such people back into work must be an essential element in a programme for full employment. The government's workstart scheme picks up a useful idea first put forward by Professor Dennis Snower to transfer the benefits of the unemployed to an employer who was prepared to take that person off the dole queue. This scheme deserves to be given a better chance than the pilots so far under way. Trade unions will support such schemes provided they are voluntary and can be shown to raise employment levels rather than subsidise jobs that would have been created anyway. Trade unions can and are playing a part in the process; in Barnsley, for instance, the trades union council is working with the local training and enterprise council in delivering help for the jobless. Finally, we need to generate a greater sense of social solidarity where those who can afford it accept that it is their duty, and to their advantage, to meet the costs of bringing back into society those who currently feel excluded because they do not have work and cannotsee an opportunity to get any meaningful work. Solidarity is a traditional trade union virtue. But the case for solidarity is not just a moral one; it is also an economic one. Left to themselves small and medium-sized firms will not train; they will only poach, and that worsens the inflation/unemployment trade off. We need a training levy to share the finances fairly. We need co-operative arrangements not just to raise the skill of the nation's workforce but also to ensure that the benefits of productivity growth in the competitive sector are shared among the unemployed and the increasing numbers of low-paid people in precarious jobs.</p>

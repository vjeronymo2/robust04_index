			<p><P> February 28, 1990, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> HARD BARGAINING AHEAD FOR CHAMORRO AND SANDINISTAS  </P> <P> After a congratulatory visit from President Daniel Ortega, opposition leader  Violeta Barrios de Chamorro began preparing Tuesday for two months of hard  bargaining with his defeated Sandinista movement over her triumphant  coalition's program for a "government of national salvation."  </P> <P> The president-elect was immediately confronted with a warning from the  Sandinista leadership that its militants will "fight without quarter" to  preserve key programs of their 10-year revolution and with a demand for  immediate disarmament of the U.S.-backed Contras.  </P> <P> Chamorro named her son-in-law, Antonio Lacayo, to head a transition team that  will negotiate with Ortega's representatives on the scheduled April 25 transfer  of power.  </P> <P> The platform of her 14-party National Opposition Union (UNO) calls for dramatic  changes that would scale down the army and the revolutionary state built up  over a decade of Sandinista rule and give freer rein to private enterprise.  </P> <P> Her margin of victory in Sunday's upset, 55.2% of the vote to Ortega's 41.8%,  has raised expectations among her supporters that hundreds of Sandinista party  officials will be evicted from homes that were seized from the  pre-revolutionary order and that Sandinista ideology will be purged from school  texts.  </P> <P> But UNO fell short of the two-thirds majority it needed in the National  Assembly to make constitutional changes. That means some elements of its  program, such as ending the constitutionally protected state monopolies on  banking and foreign trade, will require Sandinista consent.  </P> <P> More important, UNO leaders acknowledge that the Sandinistas' control of the  army and their ability to mobilize militant supporters in the streets make it  inevitable that Chamorro's conservative program will be watered down in  bargaining over the coming weeks.  </P> <P> "It's going to be harder than the normal transition," said Alfredo Cesar, one  of Chamorro's closest advisers and a former leader of the Contras, the  U.S.-backed rebel movement that fought to unseat the Sandinistas. "That means  the two sides are going to have to sit down and make sure the transition is  accomplished in a peaceful manner."  </P> <P> Ortega began that process by paying a visit to Chamorro at her home Monday  night.  </P> <P> "I bring an olive branch of peace," Ortega told her, kissing her on both  cheeks.  </P> <P> "Come here, my darling," she quipped. "I love you so much."  </P> <P> She added: "There are neither winners nor losers here."  </P> <P> That scene, and Ortega's dramatic concession speech 12 hours earlier, in which  he promised to abide by the will of the voters, seemed to offer the promise of  peaceful change in a country torn by nearly a decade of guerrilla war and a  history of rigged elections.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, Ortega read a proclamation of transition demands by the 104-member  Sandinista Assembly, a consultative body of the party's elite, to thousands of  cheering supporters in Managua's Revolution Square.  </P> <P> The proclamation warned UNO against any reversal of the Sandinista land  redistribution program, the sale of banks or mineral rights, cut-backs in  benefits to wounded Sandinista war veterans and war widows, or mass firing of  civil servants. It vowed to "defend the integrity" of the 70,000-man Sandinista  army.  </P> <P> "There will be no steps back from the fundamental conquests of the revolution,"  Ortega said.  </P> <P> Opposition leaders took the speech as a warning that the negotiations will be  difficult.  </P> <P> "The most important change in Nicaragua is not that UNO won or the Sandinista  front went down to defeat but that we are entering a new form of governing, by  negotiation rather than imposition," said Emilio Alvarez Montalban, another  Chamorro aide.  </P> <P> Rafael Solis, a Sandinista leader in the National Assembly, said: "These next  60 days, more than the elections, are going to decide the future of this  country."  </P> <P> Ortega has not announced his negotiating team, but it is expected to include  his brother, Gen. Humberto Ortega, who is defense minister.  </P> <P> Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, who came here as an election observer and  stayed to help kick off transition talks, met Tuesday with Gen. Ortega and  Lacayo, a businessman who managed his mother-in-law's campaign. Carter said he  hoped there will be a "small foundation for harmonious progress" by the time he  leaves Nicaragua today.  </P> <P> Carter said the most immediate issue is the disarming of the 10,000-man Contra  army. About 3,000 are inside Nicaragua and the rest camped in Honduras.  </P> <P> The former American president said the Sandinistas have made "no ultimatum" on  the Contras. But Solis made it clear that the Sandinistas will not even  negotiate with UNO on the issues of control or size of the army, which UNO  pledged to reduce during the campaign, until the Contras are disbanded and  return to civilian life.  </P> <P> Honduran President Rafael Callejas, who took office last month, said Tuesday  that the rebels must leave his territory now that a non-Sandinista government  has been elected.  </P></p>

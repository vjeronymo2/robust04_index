			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, Jan. 3 (YONHAP) -- The Korea Stock Exchange  got a high-kicking start to the New Year with the all-share  index jumping 13.14 points in 120 minutes Monday to close at  879.32.    Breaking last year's high of 874.1, recorded on Dec. 17, the  two- hour session caught fire on investment in large  capitalization issues.    The actual gain from last year's close is 22.21 points when  the ex-dividend index of 857.11 is considered.    Securities experts attribute the bull mood to high  expectations for the economy and inter-Korean relations in 1994.    January is generally bullish and hopes for an improved  economy helped to pump up stock prices, the experts said.    There remain fears over sale of stock stabilization fund  holdings worth 4 trillion won, but they did not show in Monday's  session, he said.    Most banking and securities issues leaped to the daily  ceiling and shares in construction and trade industries made a  strong showing while high-cost low (per) price/earnings ratio  and large manufacturing issues were bearish.    Gainers totaled 610, including 358 that hit the daily  ceiling, outnumbering 146 losers while 55 remained unchanged.    Some 22 million shares changed hands on turnover of 436.1  billion won (540 million U.S. dollars) during the two-hour  session.</p>

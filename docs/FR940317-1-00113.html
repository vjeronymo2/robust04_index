However, children born or adopted overseas will be deemed to be foreign inhabitants if there is clear evidence that they are not a member of the sponsor's household and are not residing overseas primarily because of the sponsors duty assignment. For example, a child born or adopted overseas would be deemed to be a foreign inhabitant if the child continued to reside overseas with the other parent after their military or civilian employee sponsor returns to the United States or is transferred to another foreign country on permanent change of station orders. (See paragraph 7&hyph;4c, DA Pam 27&hyph;162.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  (iii) In the case of a spouse married overseas to a member of the armed forces or a U.S. civilian employee, the spouse continues to be a foreign inhabitant until he or she moves with the sponsor to another foreign country or to the United States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  (iv) Parents or other relatives who are financially dependent on a member of the military or civilian employee, but are not members of the household, continue to be foreign inhabitants.

This precludes consideration of the claim of an insurer subrogated by operation of law or the terms of a policy of insurance for payments made by it to or for its insured. However, an insured party will not be required to exhaust a remedy against an insurer, which the insured obtained by payment of a premium to that insurer, prior to payment of a property damage claim under this chapter.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  (2) Further, no claim or any part thereof, the amount of which has been recovered or is reasonably recoverable from workmen's compensation, health insurance, social security, or any indemnifying law or indemnity contract, may be paid.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  (3) Provisions of paragraphs (c) (1) and (2) of this section are intended to preclude any payment that does not go to and remain with the injured party claimant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  (4) If the application of paragraph (c)(2) of this section would impose severe hardship upon an individual, the claim should be forwarded to Commander, USARCS, who is authorized to make exceptions in individual cases upon presentation of adequate justification.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;536.152  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Claims payable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) A claim for death, personal injury, or loss or damage to property may be allowed under this chapter if it resulted from a negligent or wrongful act or omission of any of the following categories of personnel regardless of whether the act or omission was within the scope of their employment_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  (1) Military personnel of the United States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  (2) Civilian employees of a military department or the Department of Defense who are U.S. citizens.

			<p>931213 FT  13 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: Coats Viyella Recent trading worries from Dawson International and Courtaulds Textiles have worn a hole in the textiles sector, which has dropped 10 per cent relative to the market over the past six weeks. Both companies have had particular operational problems. But there also appears to have been a general clothing sales glitch in the UK as consumer nerves frayed ahead of the Budget. Groggy markets in mainland Europe have hardly helped. Surprisingly perhaps, the sector's biggest stock, Coats Viyella, has held up reasonably well, even though a recent enhanced scrip dividend flooded the market with more shares. Coats is clearly not immune to the general forces affecting textiles and will be vulnerable to any trading wobbles in the UK, from where it derives 40 per cent of profits. Coats' business in mainland Europe, accounting for a further one-fifth of income, will also be hard hit. Yet Coats boasts greater defensive strengths than other UK textile companies with a differing product and retail mix. Coats' thread sales should prove more resilient than those derived from garments. It is also capable of generating internal gains through integrating Tootal. An increasing exposure to India, China and Russia adds a dash of long term growth appeal, while its stock market reputation is still benefiting from the strides it has taken in improving strategic clarity and financial respectability. Such factors should ensure Coats' shares are not badly unpicked so long as it sticks to its knitting while recession lingers.</p>

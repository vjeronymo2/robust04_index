Quoting official Jordanian sources, newspaper AL-SHARQ said  the new official Jordanian move has come following the recent  visit to Amman by U.S. Commerce Secretary Ronald Brown, during  which he demanded ending the secondary and tertiary boycotts of  Israel that restrict U.S. companies' activities in the Middle  East.</p>

			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / Germany closer to asylum reforms GERMANY'S ruling coalition and the opposition Social Democratic Party are expected to open talks later this week on amending the constitutional right to asylum following the outcome of the SPD's emergency congress which ended yesterday. By agreeing to amend the country's asylum laws, as well as voting to allow German troops to play a role in United Nations peace-keeping missions, the party has clearly shifted towards the centre, leaving the traditional left, and the pacifist wing increasingly marginalised. The decisions, which both require constitutional amendments, also strengthened the authority of Mr Bjorn Engholm, the SPD leader, who threatened to resign if the party congress defeated these two proposals. Government officials yesterday said talks between the coalition of the Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union and Free Democratic Party, and the SPD should begin as soon as possible. 'Asylum is the number one issue on the political agenda. We are very glad the SPD voted to amend article 16 of the constitution,' a foreign ministry official said. Mr Volker Ruhe, the defence minister, said the SPD's decision to drop its opposition to any role for German troops in international peace-keeping efforts, was 'a step in the right direction.' After a heated discussion, punctuated by references to the Nazi period and Germany's militarist tradition, delegates agreed that German troops should start playing a role in peace-keeping missions, but only under a UN security council resolution. They agreed that the Bundeswehr, or German army, should provide back-up for humanitarian relief operations, but not play a role in peace-making. Nevertheless, the decision represented a considerable shift in policy when compared to last year's SPD congress which excluded any mention of a role in UN peace-keeping operations. Mr Klaus Kinkel, the German foreign minister, has proposed that the Bundeswehr be deployed in any crisis in the world provided it operated within the guidelines of a UN Security Council resolution and that any peace-keeping activities obtained the consent of both sides in the conflict. The coalition and the SPD agree that the Bundeswehr should not participate in any Nato or Western European Union activities which take place outside Nato territory.</p>

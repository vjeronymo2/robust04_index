			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Yi Won-chae: "Improvement of the Combat </F> Capabilities of the U.S. Forces in the ROK -- View of the ROK  Defense Ministry"]    [Text] It has been reported recently that the United States  plans to deploy Patriot missiles and Apache helicopter  battalions in the ROK and plans to relocate aircraft carriers to  this region. The ROK Defense Ministry thinks that this would  contribute to beefing up the combat capabilities of the U.S.  Forces in the ROK. At the same time, it assumes a prudent  attitude toward this issue.    The Defense Ministry is trying to minimize the importance of  the report and says: "This plan is being carried out on a  normal basis as part of the U.S. plan to modernize its forces in  the ROK."    It says that the deployment of Patriot missiles in the ROK  was decided at the 23d ROK-U.S. Security Consultative Meeting in  October of 1991. Patriot missiles won a good reputation by  intercepting Iraqi Scuds during the January 1991 Gulf war.  After the war, the United States persistently asked the ROK to  buy them. However, it decided to deploy them in the U.S. Forces  in the ROK when the ROK concluded that they are not suitable to  our geographical conditions.    The Defense Ministry anticipates Patriot missiles would be  used to intercept MiG's in times of war because they are  ground-to-air missiles and are capable of intercepting aircraft,  even though the primary purpose of their deployment would be to  intercept North Korean Nodong No. 1 missiles.    Military officials predict that they will be the latest  generation of Patriot missiles whose capabilities to find  targets and range have improved significantly and are capable of  correctly intercepting and completely destroying enemy missiles'  warheads in midair to minimize damage on the ground.    However, some military experts say the missiles may not  prove  efficient in the ROK because the battlefield depth is a mere 40  km, the warning time for a North Korean attack is short, the  missile's hit rate is a mere 50 to 60 percent, and because it is  not appropriate to use the missiles in a populous area. They  also say that 36 Patriot launchers are not enough to contain  enemy air strikes because North Korea is expected to fly  aircraft over 2,000 times a day in wartime. They also say the  deployment of Patriot missiles is important in mitigating  people's uneasiness over Nodong No. 1 missiles.    Military officials concerned also say replacing the Cobra  helicopter unit with two Apache helicopter divisions is part of  the 1989 ROK-U.S. joint defense capability improvement plan.    Apache attack helicopters annihilated Iraqi tank units  during  the Gulf war. The helicopters are armed with devices to  automatically identify and pursue targets, with night firing  devices, and (Hydra) 70-mm rockets. The two-seater Apache flies  at 270 km an hour and weighs 9,525 kg.    The Defense Ministry says the deployment of aircraft  carriers  on the Korean peninsula is related to the decision made at the  1993 ROK-U.S. Security Consultative Meeting to transfer the  wartime operational command over the 7th U.S. Fleet to the  commander of the ROK-U.S. Combined Forces Command: In an  emergency, aircraft carriers would be rapidly deployed to the  Korean peninsula as part of the rapid deterrence forces concept.  It is expected that the 7th Fleet's ultramodern aircraft  carrier Carl Vinson (91,400 tonnes) and conventional aircraft  carrier Independence (86,000 tonnes) would be deployed.    The Defense Ministry considers these U.S. deployment plans  to  be a carrot-and-stick strategy for its nuclear negotiations with  North Korea because these plans were mapped out long ago and  because there is nothing worrisome about North Korea's current  military situation.</p>

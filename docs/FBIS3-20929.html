			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Mario Salvatori: "Olivetti's Challenge Begins </F> With OTM"]    [Excerpts] The news of the creation of Olivetti Telecom  and Multimedia (OTM) is very important. It could change the  future of Olivetti over the coming years and partially  contribute to resolving the serious employment problem that is  currently affecting the Ivrea-based company. For the time being  talks with the trade unions concerning surplus employees have  been suspended. According to recent unconfirmed statements this  surplus is estimated to be 2,000 people. The attention now  moves to what the Ivrea management is doing to give the general  development trends for the immediate future. Olivetti like all  the other major and medium-sized companies in the computer  sector is currently experiencing a crisis.    [passage omitted] How is it possible to get out of this  situation which appears to be one of no return. There are many  answers: widening the consumer market, moving toward software,  increasing consulting services, increasing services... One of  the winning routes is surely that of integrating the computer  and telecommunications sectors.    Today, TV, computers, and consumer electronics converge at a  single point: the possibility of providing each of us with the  information he needs (Stock Exchange quotations, soccer results,  telephone conversations, client databases etc.) wherever we find  ourselves and wherever there are archives containing this  information. For the computer world combining computers with  telecommunications is not an extra opportunity: it is the  opportunity.    For this reason the formation of Olivetti Telecom and  Multimedia is strategic: It is a real sign that Ivrea is well  aware that this marriage cannot be avoided.    OTM is divided into four operational areas supervised by  Olivetti Vice President Elserino Piol and led by Francesco Caio,  formerly De Benedetti's assistant and director of company  projects. The first area, Omnitel, is dedicated to mobile  telephony. Omintel is the consortium led by Olivetti which is  candidating itself to manage the European GSM mobile telephone  system, a 1.5 trillion-lire business that could employ more than  2,000 people and which the trade union has paid a great deal of  attention to over recent days.    The second area, Telecommunications Systems, comprises  companies that have been operating in the data transmission  networks and payment systems fields for years now: Sixtel and  Sixcom. The Cambridge laboratories fall under this area, it is  an extremely dynamic task force that in one way or another has  been behind all of Olivetti's announcements in the  telecommunications sector.    The third area, that of telecommunications services,  includes  Seva, which offers value-added services, and the Geonet network,  a property network that can represent the basic infrastructure  for the supply of outsourcing services to clients. The last  area includes the Radiocor press agency and the newborn Opera  Multimedia for CD-ROM development.</p>

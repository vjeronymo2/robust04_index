			<p>BFN     [Text] A meeting has taken place in Chita between  representatives of the autonomous region of Inner Mongolia in  the PRC with Chita Oblast Administration Head Boris Ivanov. Our  correspondent Vyacheslav Shirokiy reports:    [Shirokiy] This meeting was the logical continuation of the  recent visit by Russia's Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin to  the PRC. That is why the further prospects for trade and  economic, border and transport interaction between the two  border regions of China and Russia were the main issues of the  diplomatic meetings in the Transbaykal region. In particular,  the sides decided to ask the governments of both countries about  opening a PRC Consulate in Chita. True, initially, because of a  shortage of funds, a branch of the PRC consulate in Khabarovsk  will be operating in Chita. Apart from this, the Chita and  Chinese sides noted the fact that their trade relations have  reached a far higher level. Therefore, investing funds in joint  enterprises for the production of consumer goods is now far more  advantageous both for Russia and China: For instance, by the  autumn a meat processing combine will be built jointly in  Akshinskiy, in Chita Oblast.    The prospect of building the Irkutsk - Ulan-Ude - Chita -  PRC  powerline aroused considerable interest among the guests:  Surplus electricity will pass from Russia to China and the other  way round. It is planned to settle all these operations  exclusively in freely convertible currency. The economies of  the two countries are sufficiently developed for such a step, it  was noted at the meeting.</p>

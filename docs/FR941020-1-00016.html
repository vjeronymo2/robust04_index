If the commodity is intended for resale, any sales contracts entered into between the importer and a subsequent buyer must contain terms that notify the subsequent buyer that:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The commodity being purchased originated in Canada;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The commodity being purchased is deemed ineligible for use under CCC and U.S. Department of Agriculture-assisted export programs;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The subsequent buyer shall preserve, on an origin-basis, the identity of the commodity being purchased;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) The commodity may not be commingled or blended with U.S.-produced commodities until such time as the commodity is delivered to an end-user;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) The end-user or subsequent buyer must file quarterly reports as described below; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) Any sales contracts entered into between any subsequent buyers must contain the same terms specified herewith. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> The importer must provide the subsequent buyer with a copy of the end-use certificate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This proposed rule would also require the importer to submit to KCCO, within 10 workdays after delivery of the commodity to the end-user, a copy of the bill of lading acknowledging receipt of the commodity by the end-user and the date the commodity was received at the end-user's facility. If the commodity is imported for purposes of resale, the importer must submit to KCCO, within 10 workdays from date of sale, its subsequent buyer's name, address, and telephone number, and the quantity sold.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This proposed rule would require end-users to report to KCCO the status of the imported grain on form ASCS&hyph;751, End-Use Certificate for Grain Quarterly Report, until the commodity is fully used.

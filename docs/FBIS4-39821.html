			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Nataliya Filipchuk: "When It Is Time To Hurry </F> Up...."]    [Text] Finally the emotions stirred by Crimea calmed down  a bit and politicians began to ponder: When did the Crimean  problem emerge? Was it in 1783 when the Crimea was annexed by  the Russian Empire or in 1954 when the devastated peninsula,  lacking a national affiliation, was handed over to Ukraine,  which played the role of an intensive care unit? Or, was it in  1991 when Ukraine permitted the referendum and then acknowledged  Crimean autonomy thus planting a time bomb? What is the  underlying cause of the Crimean problem, how should it be  resolved, and what consequences can it produce -- these were the  central questions asked at a press conference called by the  group of strategic researchers, "Young Europeans for Security,"  (the Institute of Strategic Research), the Mejlis of the Crimean  Tatars, and the "Reforms" Ukrainian Supreme Council deputies'  group.    In the opinion of Refat Chubarov, leader of the Kurultay  faction at the Crimean Supreme Soviet, the Crimean problem  emerged when it was separated from the problem of the Crimean  Tatars. This is why it needs to be resolved based on these  people. Chubarov believes that this is possible when three  conditions are met: the legal basis, money, and stability at the  Crimean peninsula. Only, how can it be achieved? By turning a  blind eye on illegal actions of the Crimean parliament and  accepting relations between Ukraine and its integral part on a  treaty basis? Politicians advocating this option make a  mistake. There is no guarantee that in half a year, those  treaties will not be unilaterally broken.    Chubarov cited a draft appeal by the majority in the Crimean  parliament to the Russian State Duma that said: "The Crimean  Supreme Soviet counts on decisive actions taken along with the  State Duma regarding the final determination of the Crimea's  status as part of Russian Federation." Obviously, the  far-reaching plans of the present Crimean parliament cannot be  changed even by an agreement between Ukraine and Russia on the  Black Sea Fleet (if one is possible any time soon).    In this situation, the Ukrainian Supreme Council ought to  assume full powers and responsibility for resolving the  conflict. As for practical implementation of decisions by the  Ukrainian parliament, the Crimean people, perhaps the most  powerful force in the Crimea upholding the Ukrainian interests,  is willing to handle this issue. "The Crimea's native people  must be returned to their homeland, and they will decide about  the future of the peninsula," Mustafa Dzemilev, head of the  Crimean Mejlis, stated at a press conference. But of 492 billion  karbovanets [K] in capital investment and the K197 billion  allocated from the Ukrainian budget, Crimean Tatars have so far  received only K100 billion. This makes Turkey's assistance in  financing and building 1,000 apartments even more valuable and  timely.    However, may be for the first time ever, the problem was  raised at the press conference of Ukraine's weakening control  over the Crimean economy and on privatization, in particular.  In the words of Vyacheslav Shved, an expert from the strategic  research group, Russian capital intensified its influence in the  region. For example, Russian corporations "Twentieth Century,"  "Arbat-Moscow," "Alpha Capital," and others surprisingly quickly  buy out Crimean assets, capturing 10 to 15 percent of all  sanatoriums. By the end of 1994, according to Meshkov's edict,  it is planned to privatize 19 enterprises key for the Crimean  economy, including ports. There is no guarantee that this  Ukrainian property, too, will not change its "citizenship."    The most regrettable thing is, as deputy Viktor Pynzenyk,  leader of the "Reforms" legislative group, noted, that although  it was an illegal action, Meshkov was right signing this and  other edicts concerning taxes, currency regulation, and the  banking system. Ukraine has no laws that would provide  enterprises with free access to currency and credits and that  would not hinder privatization. The Crimeans very deftly shifted  emphasis from economy to politics, covering at the same time  their tails by progressive, if not perfect, reforms.    So, it is obvious that the Crimean problem was caused by  many  reasons and has many solutions. Yet another one was proposed by  Ukrainian President L. Kravchuk during a meeting at the  Ukrainian Supreme Council: one should straighten out relations  with Russia. The most important thing is not to miss the chance,  even though they say "hurry without haste." But does it really  have to be that way in all our history?</p>

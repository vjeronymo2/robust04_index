			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / International Company News: Net income increases at SA conglomerate Rembrandt, the South African tobacco-based conglomerate, managed to shake off the previous year's static performance to report a 10.3 per cent advance in attributable earnings, to 200.9 cents a share from 182.1 cents, for the 12 months to March. Net income before tax rose 6.4 per cent to R1.3bn (Dollars 361m) from R1.25bn. As a result of a cut in corporate tax the company paid slightly less tax of R408.8m, compared with R478.1m, while net income after tax rose 19.3 per cent to R924.6m from R774.7m. The company is one of South Africa's largest and most consistently successful conglomerates. It is controlled by the Rupert family, which also controls Swiss-based tobacco and luxury goods company Richemont. The group's final dividend is 26.4 cents a share, bringing the total for the year to 43.44 cents, up from 36.2 cents a share. Rembrandt, which did not release a breakdown of performance by units, dominates the local tobacco industry with a market share of around 80 per cent. This sector normally contributes about 40 per cent to Rembrandt's bottom line. Growth is expected to continue next year, but analysts warn that a possible increase in excise duties and other tobacco taxes may hurt the company. Following the unbundling of Gencor last year, and Rembrandt's decision to exchange shares in Genbel for further shares in Malbak, Rembrandt has declared its interests in the unbundled companies to be: Gencor, 13.8 per cent; Engen, 6.8 per cent; Sappi, 5.1 per cent; and Malbak, 7 per cent. Only the Gencor interests have been accounted in the results.</p>

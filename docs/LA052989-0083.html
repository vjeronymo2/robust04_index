			<p><P> May 29, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: POP/ROCK  </P> <P> Next year's Grammy Awards will include separate categories for hard rock and  heavy metal acts, the sponsoring National Academy of Recording Arts and  Sciences has announced. The music awards show came under fire this year when  the combined hard rock/heavy metal award, in its first year, went to  progressive rock veteran Jethro Tull over favored metal band Metallica. Other  changes voted in by the NARAS trustees include limited eligibility for new  single releases of songs from older albums and the broadening of eligibility  requirements for the best new artist and producer of the year nominations.

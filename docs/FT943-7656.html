			<p>940822 FT  22 AUG 94 / Observer: Duty calls Is Sir Paul Newall, the globe-trotting Lord Mayor of London, trying to set some sort of world record? After mayoral trips to Japan, South Korea, Saudi Arabia and Hungary, he is sneaking in a grand tour of the US and Canada, before planned visits to Muscat, Jordan, Kuwait and Strasbourg. If he goes on like this the City Corporation might have to invest in a corporate jet to cut down on the cost of flying him and his entourage around the world. His latest trip is no sun-seeking sojourn, however, given the 13-city, 20-day itinerary planned to promote Britain and the City and to encourage bilateral trade and investment. He enjoys banging the drum and wishes more would join in. Having finally got his knighthood, a lesser figure might have eased up a bit so that he could enjoy entertaining at home in the Mansion House. Not so, Sir Paul. Let's hope his successor is as diligent.</p>

			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / Mortgage fraudsters sent to jail FOUR solicitors were jailed yesterday at Liverpool Crown Court for their part in a mortgage fraud. A total of 16 men, including the solicitors, were jailed for periods ranging from six months to three years, and three women received community service orders. The 19-strong network made 128 applications for more than 90 properties in Greater Manchester and Lancashire, usually giving false details, and backed by the solicitors and a professional property valuer. More than Pounds 1.8m was obtained from building societies, banks and other financial institutions and the team made unsuccessful attempts to obtain a further Pounds 2.5m. Two solicitors and a valuer were found guilty after a 10-week trial and the rest pleaded guilty to their various roles. The applications, with property values falsely inflated by the valuer, were made by the property developers, who often used false or fictitious names with the aid of the solicitors. Sentencing them, Mr Justice Jowitt said that, with the right combination of dishonest people, mortgage fraud was all too easy to commit. Mr Rodney Klevan QC, prosecuting, described the fraud as 'a well-organised network of people each playing a particular role in false or fraudulent mortgage applications'.</p>

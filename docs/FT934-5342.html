			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / International Company News: NCC aims to raise SKr545m NCC, the Swedish property and construction group, plans to ask shareholders for up to SKr545m (Dollars 64.9m) in new capital following a return to profit for the first nine months of 1993. The company said a stronger capital base would enable it to participate more actively in the restructuring of the construction industry which is under way in Sweden. NCC is to offer new shares on a two-for-five basis at SKr27.50 a share, a substantial discount to the SKr64 at which the shares were trading last week. The issue, which will raise the group's equity-to-assets ratio by two percentage points to 22 per cent, is being supported by Nordstjernan, the Swedish property and construction group which with 55 per cent of the capital is NCC's largest shareholder. NCC had a pre-tax profit of SKr548m for the first nine months, compared with a SKr252m loss in the same 1992 period. However, before extraordinary items, profit amounted to just SKr73m, compared with a SKr101m deficit last time. The improvement was helped by cost-cutting and reduced losses from associated companies. It came in spite of the continuing collapse of the Swedish construction market, which pushed down revenues to SKr13.0bn from SKr14.9bn. NCC expects a full-year pre-tax profit of between SKr400m and SKr500m, before an expected SKr300m in write-downs on property developments.</p>

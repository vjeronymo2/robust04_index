			<p><P> November 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSEUM FUND-RAISING DRIVE BEGINS  </P> <P> Trustees of the Japanese American National Museum, set to open in Little Tokyo  in late 1990, kicked off a fund-raising drive this weekend that they hope will  bring in $20 million.  </P> <P> The official campaign began Friday with a $100,000 contribution from Bank of  America, said Irene Hirano, the museum's executive director. That brings to $4  million the amount donated so far, including a $1-million grant from the Los  Angeles Community Redevelopment Agency last year, she said.  </P> <P> The CRA funds will be used for the first phase of construction -- the  $10-million renovation of the 64-year-old Nishi Hongwanji Buddhist Temple at  1st Street and Central Avenue. The three-story brick temple is set to open as a  museum by late 1990. It will house the museum's first exhibit, a collection of  photographs and other items documenting the Issei, or first wave of Japanese  immigrants to the United States between 1885 and 1924.  </P> <P> Museum trustees plan to eventually construct a second building on an 8-acre  parcel just north of the temple, Hirano said.  </P></p>

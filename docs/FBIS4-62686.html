			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by AZERTADZH correspondent Gekchekkhanum Tagiyeva -- </F> TASS]    [Text] Baku 17 May TASS -- "Having complete authority to  sign the final protocol offered at negotiations in Moscow, I did  not do it only because some aspects required additional  studies," Azeri Defence Minister Mamedrafi Mamedov, who headed  the Azeri military delegation to Moscow negotiations of  Azerbaijan, Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh, told AZERTADZH today.    In his words, the document can be signed only after the  Azeri  specification of some items of the protocol, whose major  provisions have been basically coordinated.    Mamedov said the Azeri troops staying in the Armenian-Azeri  conflict zone have been ordered to cease fire despite the fact  Azerbaijan has not signed the final protocol. The cease-fire  agreement is being observed by both sides, he stressed.</p>

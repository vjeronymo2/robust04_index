			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Zagreb, April 17 (AFP) -- Gorazde is now  completely submerged in a wave of refugees who have fled Bosnian  Serb shelling, a UN aid agency spokesman said here Sunday [17  April].    Peter Kessler, spokesman for the United Nations High  Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), said 25,000 civilians had  taken refuge in the eastern Bosnian town since the Serb  offensive on the Moslem enclave began March 29.    Speaking in French, Kessler said: "Gorazde is submerged with  refugees and there is not a single free square metre of space in  both public and private buildings in the town."    Most of the refugees had arrived since Friday, when the Serb  offensive intensified, he said.    Both Bosnian Serb and Bosnian government media reported that  the battle for the enclave -- a UN-declared "safe area" -- was  continuing Sunday, hours after NATO came within seconds of  launching an air strike there when one of its planes was downed  by missile fire.    Meanwhile in Geneva, the Red Cross announced an emergency  plan to ferry in fresh aid teams to ease the humanitarian crisis  in the besieged enclave.    The town, which had a population of 37,000 prior to the  Bosnian war, was now crammed full with more than 60,000 people,  while Moslem villages outside the city walls had been left  deserted in the face of the Serb advance, Kessler said.    Kessler added that Serb "snipers" had now started firing at  key locations, including the town's hospital, from frontline  positions no more than a few hundred metres (yards) from the  town centre.    The snipers were targeting the wounded inside their hospital  beds Saturday, Kessler said, adding that a doctor was injured  the same day by a Serb shell which landed around 15 metres from  the hospital.    According to figures released Friday, more than 240 people  have died and around 1,100 been wounded during the Serb  offensive. Kessler said Sunday midday that "these figures have  increased greatly since then."    The four-member UNHCR team in the town has taken refuge in a  bank strongroom and can only venture out after nightfall as Serb  snipers have Gorazde in their sights throughout the day.    The "dramatic humanitarian situation" in Gorazde prompted  the  International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in Geneva to  launch an immediate "action plan" on behalf of the enclave.    ICRC teams in Belgrade, Pale and Sarajevo "are ready to go  immediately to Gorazde to bring help to the numerous victims" of  the shelling, the organisation said in a statement issued  overnight Saturday.    The back-up teams could leave as soon as the necessary  authorisation had been gained, the statement said.    It added that the ICRC was seeking guarantees from the  warring parties that they would "respect the civilian  population" and give unrestricted access to aid teams treating  prisoners and evacuating the wounded, and to road convoys  bringing in emergency supplies.    The ICRC currently has a 12-member team in Gorazde. [passage  omitted]</p>

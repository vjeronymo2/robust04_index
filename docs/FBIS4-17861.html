			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Aleksandr Kondrashov] </F>   [Text] Belgrade, 27 Apr -- Our trip to the republics of  former Yugoslavia has reinforced the view of all members of the  delegation that the issue of revoking sanctions against the FRY  should be raised in the Duma. We realize that our parliament is  not the final level of authority, that this matter has to be  settled at the United Nations and that its settlement will be  bound up with many difficulties, but Russia is duty-bound to  press for this. Our whole delegation, which represents the  majority of parliamentary factions, is unanimous on that,  Nikolay Bosborodov, deputy chairman of the defense committee and  head of the parliamentary delegation of the Russian State Duma,  said in an interview to the ITAR-TASS correspondent.    The issue of sanctions, he continued, is closely bound up  with an overall political settlement of the conflict. The Duma  has already adopted a decision on holding hearings on this  matter, and representatives of all the republics of former  Yugoslavia are invited. Undoubtedly serious preparations need  to be made for such hearings and many issues need to be worked  through, but the discussion could represent very promising  assistance in unravelling the Yugoslav knot.    The head of the Russian parliamentary delegation voiced his  distress and surprise at recent statements made by various  Russian diplomats during the delegation's visit. "We do not  understand their consent to NATO ultimatums to the Bosnian  Serbs. It is obvious that NATO's intervention in the Bosnian  conflict can only exacerbate the ferocity of the warring sides  and expand the war area, and that it threatens to draw  Yugoslavia into the war. On this matter we support the stance  of the Russian defense minister," the head of the Russian  delegation said.    Moreover, Bosborodov said, when we were talking to the  commander of the Russian blue helmets battalion and asked him  what help was needed above all, the commander asked for one  thing only: "for the Foreign Ministry not to change its stance  every day."</p>

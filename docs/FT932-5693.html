			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / Survey of Shanghai (10): Leading supplier for quality products - Baoshan Steelworks Back in the 1970s, big billboards in Shanghai showed workers sweating at furnaces and hammering at molten metal, producing steel to make China into an industrial power. Baoshan steelworks, on the banks of the mighty Yangtze river 25km north-west of Shanghai, was to be at the vanguard of China's drive to industrialise. Today Baoshan's managers have more modest aims. Last year China produced 80m tonnes of steel products, double the quantity of 10 years ago. Mr Wu Zhi Shang, Baoshan's acting director, says several other plants in China now produce more than Baoshan's annual 6.73m tonnes of steel. 'Our main asset is the quality of our products,' says Mr Wu. 'We produce a wider variety of steel and of a better quality than any other plant in the country.' The present rapid expansion of China's economy means that demand for steel products is at an all time high, with prices for some high grade items having risen by as much as 50 per cent over the last year. Mr Wu describes Baoshan as a highly successful enterprise, selling all it can produce. He denies that Baoshan has been responsible for the recent rapid price rises: these, he says, are due to differences between supply and demand. The outlook at Baoshan was not always so good. Baoshan was among a number of grandiose projects announced in the mid-1970s designed to transform China into a 'modern, powerful, socialist country' by the turn of the century. Baoshan was heralded as the largest single construction project to be undertaken since the founding of the People's Republic in 1949. But from the beginning, Baoshan was plagued with problems. The site of the works was marshy, causing subsidence problems: 100,000 concrete piles had to be driven into the soil to shore up the plant. The nearby estuary was found to be too shallow to accommodate the large carriers of imported iron ore. A long wharf had to be built out into the waters of the Yangtze river. By 1983 Baoshan was running into serious financial difficulties. Deliveries of equipment, mainly from Japan, had to be rescheduled as central government reassessed development priorities. The first phase of work at Baoshan was finally put into operation in 1985, three years behind schedule. But after the initial problems Baoshan's fortunes appear to have changed, largely due to the big upturn in demand for its products. In 1991 the second phase of Baoshan's construction was completed. So far more than Dollars 5.5bn has been spent on Baoshan: its directors say sales last year were worth more than Dollars 2bn, a 40 per cent increase on the 1991 figure. 'We are now paying the state back the capital loans it made for Baoshan's construction,' says Mr Wu. Profits at Baoshan are growing and last year amounted to between 10 and 15 per cent of sales, he adds. Baoshan is the leading supplier in China for quality steel products. It supplies most of the steel used in construction of vehicles at the nearby Volkswagen car plant in Shanghai. A few years ago most steel plate for China's ambitious shipbuilding programme had to be imported. Now Baoshan supplies the needs of many of the country's shipyards. In spite of Baoshan's recent success, industry analysts say considerable work still needs to be done to improve efficiency. Although many operations at Baoshan are now computerised, the plant still has more than 23,000 workers. But as long as China's economy keeps in the fast lane, Baoshan's future seems assured. A third phase of building at Baoshan is due to be completed by the turn of the century, bringing annual output to more than 10m tonnes. As China moves towards a market economy even industrial giants such as Baoshan will be left to fend for themselves. 'The next phase of building is going to cost more than Rmb20bn (Dollars 3.6bn),' says Mr Wu. 'The government has told us it will not invest any more money. This time we have to raise all the finance ourselves.'</p>

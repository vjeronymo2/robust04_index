			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses end mixed after intraday recovery A DAY of grief in a number of early-closing markets was balanced later when Wall Street responded to an improvement in consumer confidence, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT ended yesterday's floor trading with the DAX index at the day's low of 1,510.28, down 20.61, reflecting interest rate and currency worries and poor performances from the car maker, Volkswagen, and the steel group, Thyssen. Turnover rose from DM3.8bn to DM4.6bn. Interest rate hopes foundered on M3 growth of 10.2 per cent in October against 9.3 per cent in September and a Bundesbank target of 3.5 to 5.5 per cent for 1992. Cyclicals weakened on an easier dollar and Germany's worsening terms of trade with many of its European partners. Automotive producers and component makers all weakened, but Volkswagen had the worst of the session with a fall of DM17 or 6 per cent to DM268.50 on lower nine-month profits and a forecast of a dramatic worsening in the fourth quarter. The shares recovered to DM271 in London in the afternoon on short-covering. In a weak steels sector, Thyssen fell DM5.30 to DM158.70 on expectations of a dividend cut when it produces its 1991-92 figures tomorrow. Karstadt fell DM13 to DM504 and dragged other retailers down with it on a forecast of lower 1992 profits. Bayer continued to suffer from Monday's news of a sharply lower third quarter, ending DM6.30 lower at DM248.50. PARIS jumped 2.7 per cent on bargain-hunting on the first day of the December trading account, historically a good account as fund managers indulge in some year-end window-dressing. Investors were also encouraged by much better than expected third quarter GDP data which showed a rise of 0.4 per cent, compared with expectations of a rise of just 0.1 per cent. The CAC-40 index closed 45.84 higher at 1,720.61 in steady turnover of FFr2.4bn. Dealers believed that some players were buying the market in the hope that a devaluation in the franc which prompt a rally in share prices. The Bank of France was reported to have intervened in the currency market yesterday to prevent the D-Mark rising above FFr3.40. Among active risers, Euro Disney recouped FFr2 to FFr63.50 after its recent drop to a record low and Elf put on FFr13.10 to FFr323.70. MILAN fell further as buying interest dried up but dealers reported some demand just before the close which lifted share prices off the day's lows. The Comit index fell 15.54 to 446.45 in turnover estimated at around L224.3bn. Sme, the state-controlled food company, was fixed L38 lower at L5,361 as a number of speculators sold out, taking the view that it would be some time before the company was privatised. But the stock reached a high of L5,695 after hours. Banca Commerciale Italiana, another privatisation candidate, fell L18 to L4,501. Dealers said Generali's performance reflected the market's volatility as the stock dropped L1,080, or 3.7 per cent to L28,400. Nordic markets were a study in contrasts. HELSINKI climbed 3.2 per cent, the Hex index closing 25.1 higher at 810.1 on hopes that a nationwide strike could be avoided. OSLO slipped on renewed worries that Norway would be forced to devalue the crown, the all-share index closing 2.07 lower at 346.68 in turnover worth NKr215m. COPENHAGEN dropped 1.8 per cent, the CSE index ending 4.59 down at 257.44 on fears that the strong Danish line on maintaining the parity of the Danish currency would rebound on equity prospects. AMSTERDAM finished mixed as the CBS Tendency Index closed at 102.3, down 0.3. Unilever fell Fl 2 to Fl 180.70 on news that its co-chairman Mr Floris Maljers said he saw no improvement in trading conditions in the near term. ZURICH staged an intraday recovery to close with the SMI index 12.5 easier at 1,879.1, some 10 points above the day's low. Similarly, late buying lifted MADRID off its lows but the general index still dropped 1.82 to 210.22 as turnover thinned to Pta11bn from Pta17bn on Tuesday and more than Pta30bn late last week. VIENNA continued its slide with a fall of 1.2 per cent, the ATX index closing 9.23 lower at 769.64. Austrian Airlines fell nearly 5 per cent or Sch81 to Sch1,699 as domestic and foreign investors moved out.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                     FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- November 24                                         THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes                Open      10.30      11.00      12.00  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100        1029.95    1030.91    1029.84    1032.31 FT-SE Eurotrack 200        1104.70    1103.91    1102.32    1105.25  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes               13.00      14.00      15.00      Close  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100        1033.87    1033.89    1036.15    1038.83 FT-SE Eurotrack 200        1105.93    1107.68    1108.53    1110.69  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Nov 23    Nov 20    Nov 19    Nov 18    Nov 17  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1038.38   1051.29   1047.93   1051.36   1056.32 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1110.18   1117.40   1110.76   1106.59   1109.66  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- High/day: 100 - 1039.01; 200 - 1110.87 Low/day: 100 - 1029.10  200 - 1101.83  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

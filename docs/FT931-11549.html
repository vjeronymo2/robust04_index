			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / Biggest airline reservation systems merge THE merger of two of the world's biggest airline computer reservation systems was finalised yesterday, creating a new company called Galileo International. Galileo International will combine the European Galileo network with the US Covia-Apollo reservation system. The move will result in job losses at the Galileo data centre in Swindon, Wiltshire, whose data processing operations will be absorbed over the next 12 months by a combined facility in Denver, Colorado. Computer reservation systems have increasingly become a key weapon in the competitive arsenal of international airlines. But the huge cost of setting up and operating these systems has forced airlines to try to pool resources. Shareholders in the new company will include British Airways, United Airlines, USAir, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, Swissair, Alitalia, Aer Lingus, Air Canada, Olympic Airways, TAP Air Portugal and Austrian Airlines. The new company, which claims to be the first global computer reservation system group, will be 50 per cent owned by European carriers and 50 per cent owned by US airlines. Its headquarters will be in Chicago. It will maintain a marketing and product development facility at Swindon, where some staff will be redeployed. Its main competitor is the Sabre network owned by American Airlines, which attempted but failed two years ago to merge with another European computer reservation system, called Amadeus. However, the Galileo-Apollo merger still has to be approved by US and European Commission regulators. On both sides of the Atlantic, regulators are considering introducing new rules for computer reservation systems to prevent distortions in airline competition by the use of these powerful networks. Mr Giovanni Bisignani, the chief executive of Alitalia, has been chosen as chairman of the new merged company, which claims a 30 per cent share of the world airline reservation market. He said yesterday that the new company was 'a combination of two recognised computer reservation market leaders with a long success story of co-operation'.</p>

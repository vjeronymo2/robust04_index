			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / Energy policy praised by IEA The government's free-market approach to energy does constitute a policy - and that is official. The International Energy Agency, the Paris-based group of industrialised countries, yesterday gave its blessing to the laisser-faire stance - often denounced as a 'non-policy'. It says in a review that while Britain's energy policy does not have targets and prescriptions, 'it is based on a clearly articulated principle of reliance on market forces'. Moreover, 'the overall direction of UK energy policy can be commended as consistent with the IEA shared goals' of open and free markets. The UK experience could be useful to other members of the IEA who are restructuring largely state-owned energy industries. The accolade was accepted gratefully by the government. Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, said: 'I welcome this endorsement of our liberalisation policy. The UK is pleased to be in the vanguard of change and a model for others to follow.' The IEA was not wholly unreserved in its praise. It said there were still imperfections in the gas and electricity markets and urged action to remove restrictions on the movement of oil and gas. The government could do more to raise energy efficiency and improve the environment, particularly by ensuring that the transport sector bore its share of energy costs. Mr Eggar said that many of the IEA's criticisms were already being acted on. The IEA reviews members' energy policies every four years. The UK review will be published later this year. The Confederation of British Industry yesterday called for Europe to press ahead with opening up its gas and electricity networks to competition as 'part of the drive to restore Europe's international competitiveness'. Mr Howard Davies, CBI director-general, said Europe needed an internal energy market which gave businesses the freedom to shop around. He said some of the largest users were in industries such as chemicals which competed in tough international markets where energy costs had a strong bearing on success.</p>

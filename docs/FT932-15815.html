			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / Cuomo spurns nomination to Supreme Court GOVERNOR Mario Cuomo of New York has taken himself out of consideration for nomination to the US Supreme Court, according to news reports yesterday. Mr Cuomo, who has long been an eloquent social conscience for the Democratic party, had been viewed as the frontrunner to replace Justice Byron White, who will retire from the court this summer. But Newsday, a New York daily newspaper, reported yesterday the governor had withdrawn his name, and the Associated Press said White House officials had confirmed the report. President Bill Clinton refused to discuss the Supreme Court appointment yesterday, but said he thought Mr Cuomo was 'terrific'. During last year's presidential election campaign Mr Clinton had said he thought the New York governor would make a good Supreme Court justice, and Mr Cuomo himself has said the position would be ideal. However, in his usual ambivalent style, he also likened the court to a tomb. Mr Cuomo may be unwilling to give up his high profile in the political arena. Membership of the Supreme Court is usually a lifetime job, and Mr Cuomo has often been mentioned as a potential Democratic presidential candidate. Mr Clinton will be the first Democrat to select a Supreme Court justice since President Lyndon Johnson, and the appointment is viewed as reversing the court's long march towards a more conservative jurisprudence under the intellectual leadership of Justice Antonin Scalia. Besides Mr Cuomo, most speculation on a replacement has centred on sitting judges such as Ms Patricia Wald or Ms Stephanie Seymour, who are on federal appeals courts. While most recent nominees have been judges, in the past the Supreme Court has included more politicians and legal scholars.</p>

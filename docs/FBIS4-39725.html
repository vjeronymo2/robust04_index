			<p>BFN     [Text] Riigikogu Speaker Ulo Nugis made a statement at a  news conference today, and said that he is ready to run for  premier. The Riigikogu speaker acknowledged that the present  crisis within the Fatherland party has transported itself to the  Cabinet, and that there is a serious danger that this may turn  into a constitutional crisis. Now some of his fellow thinkers  in the republican group within the Fatherland Party have  recommended that he should stand for the Fatherland's chairman  and take it upon himself to form a new government, as a  candidate for premier. According to Nugis, he sees this as a  task from his fellow thinkers. Shirking one's responsibility  can only be seen as a betrayal of one's ideals, said Nugis.    According to him, the Riigikogu has now formed the opinion  that the Government led by Mart Laar cannot stay. In the  opinion of the Riigikogu speaker, parliament is ready for a vote  of no confidence in the present government, regardless of the  outcome of the elections at the Fatherland meeting. According  to Nugis, the government coalition is also of the same opinion.</p>

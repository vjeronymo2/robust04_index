			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / Arts: 'Cosi' in a sharp new light - Music Theatre London's latest production Dorabella lifts her face from her paperback (Raw Energy) and says 'I'm totally energised]' She and Fiordiligi are waiting outside the electrically fenced MOD enclosure. Where can their RAF lovers, Ferrando and Guglielmo, be? Then they hear that the boyfriends are being sent straight into action today. Meeting in a quick but tearful farewell ('. . . life's a bitch and then you die'), the girls beg the men 'You must be sure to 'phone'. But soon two rich American strangers (F. and G. in disguise) enter the girls' lives, announcing 'We're hung like two sun-ripe bananas' . . . Music Theatre London has its own style, and has had notable success in Mozart's Figaro and Don Giovanni and Rossini's Cinderella. The performers are actors who can also sing; recitatives are spoken; and everything is transposed into present-day England. This method has made us see the societies of old operas by a newly sharp light, while laughing at the England we know. Now MTL is tackling Cos fan tutte. Despina is a neighbour who pops in to borrow some sugar, and Dorabella stuffs herself neurotically with chocolate biscuits as her first aria ends. Cos, however, faces MTL with a new kind of problem, because it is less to do with sociological structure than Figaro, Giovanni and Cinderella. Class tensions are virtually absent from Cos, whose subject - women's capacity for infidelity, and men's reactions to that - is developed in private. Another problem is that the usual MTL director, Nick Broadhurst, was unable to shape the entire show; William Relton is billed as 'co-director', and this Cos only fitfully displays the impish, revelatory modern detail that kept bubbling up through the company's previous work. Yet, although this staging is not always neat or satisfying, it addresses the core of Cos seriously - and so proves often stimulating, often entertaining. Its strengths and weaknesses of this Cos are best illustrated by its Ferrando, Simon Butteriss (an MTL regular). Ferrando, Cos's least defined character, is appalled when he finds that Dorabella has betrayed him  -yet, trying to seduce Fiordiligi only minutes later, he becomes (musically) so impassioned that we wonder if he has transferred affection. In this case, we don't wonder any more - we know. Butteriss keeps forcing us to attend to the workings of Ferrando's heart when Mozart leaves us (and Ferrando) ambiguous. This helps us to re-think Ferrando, but not always to believe simply that he is Ferrando. No-one onstage is more vividly alive to every nuance, more exemplary in dramatic commitment, but he actually works too hard. To cope with the role's rigorous lines, he has acquired newly lyrical and heroic vocal tones - enlarging his usually incisive, but strenuous and tight, vocal method. These new 'Ferrando' tones, however, are not unified; you can hear him changing tack vocally. Fiordiligi (Jacinta Mulcahy), Dorabella (Mary Lincoln), and Guglielmo (Peter Corry) - all vocally more relaxed - give sensitive, accomplished performances that are intermittently exciting. Fiordiligi gets visibly high on the defiant proclamations of fidelity in her first aria; and Dorabella's giggly second aria (here sung in a drunken lather) exposes her own unresisting emotional helplessness. Both girls are brunette beauties. But, despite several such illuminating passages, they lack force of character, so that sometimes we feel what certain opponents of Cos have claimed: that these people are fools. The two most completely conceived characters are Alfonso (Richard Hampton) and Despina (Marilyn Cutts). Hampton's delivery, however, is laborious and grey, whereas the tension whooshes up with Cutts's every entrance. She sings and acts this nosy, knowing neighbour with easy assurance. Tony Britten, leading the band of five, gives the show the right brisk pulse. The ensembles, as they should, danced. The show's tone is not consistent, but it adds to our understanding of this most imponderable opera. At the Greenwich Theatre until December 6</p>

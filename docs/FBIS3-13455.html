Ahmad al-Jabir  categorically denied reports that the detention of some Kuwaiti  fishermen by Iranian coastal guards has dampened bilateral  relations .    "I do not know from where you come with these false  information," Ahmad al-Jabir replied to the AL-MAJALLAH  correspondent when he alleged that Tehran-Kuwait relations are  "disturbed" because of the arrest of "many" Kuwaiti fishermen by  Iranian border guards. "Concerning the problem of the Kuwaiti  fishermen and the detention of some of them by Iranian coastal  guards, this is due to the interlocking of the territorial  waters of the two countries.    "Officials of both countries are now taking practical steps  to avoid such problems in the future which I do not think  disturb the good and growing relations between the two countries  and their two friendly peoples," the Kuwaiti foreign minister  added.    In the interview published in last week's issue of the Arab  magazine, Ahmad al-Jabir said Kuwait continues to support the  just struggle of the Palestinian people "despite the position of  its leadership."</p>

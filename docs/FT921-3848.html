			<p>920312 FT  12 MAR 92 / World Commodities Prices: Wool Prices at wool sales in Australia this week were unchanged or a little cheaper and it is now recognised that the strong rise in February reached an upper limit by the beginning of March. There has been no major decline but inevitably the general reaction in wool using markets is to wait and see what happens before coming to further major buying decisions. The UK Budget has useful measures designed to help small businesses but its impact on recovery and interest rates is now seen as dependent on the General Election. The AWC Market indicator was 638 cents on March 11th.</p>

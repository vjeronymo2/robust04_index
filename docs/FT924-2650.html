			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / Letter: Cadbury must not lead to creation of 'two-tier' shareholders Sir, Mr Makinson (Letters December 4) does an ill-service to both improving corporate governance and democratic principles with his lofty dismissal of the role of individual shareholders. He suggests that corporate governance should remain the responsibility of institutions and that individual shareholders will continue to waste their time with 'conversations over tea and a bun at the annual meeting'. Isn't he a little out of tune with the times when we have charters galore aimed at bolstering the rights of the individual? We might even have a shareholders' charter one day. If corporate governance is poor and profits decline it is the individual investor's pocket which suffers either immediately via reduced dividends/share values or, if he chooses an institution to invest for him, via reduced policy bonuses etc. Institutional investors' pockets, if a meaningful concept, are subject to different forces. But institutional shareholders also have corporate governance problems just like the companies in which they invest. That doesn't diminish the vital role they play, it just puts into context the important role which the individual shareholder ought also to perform - but often doesn't. As Cadbury says 'if too many AGMs are at present an opportunity missed, this is because shareholders (whatever the size of their holding) do not make the most of them and, in some cases, boards do not encourage them." Institutional and individual shareholders both wish to invest in successful and profitable companies. Better corporate governance should contribute to that aim. This association believes institutional and individual shareholders should seek ways of working together to achieve that aim and we will be trying to bring this about in a number of ways. We need the support of individual shareholders to do this and to respond constructively to the Cadbury recommendations. Cadbury has turned his face against two-tier boards and we should turn our faces against 'two-tier' shareholders.

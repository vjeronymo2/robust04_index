			<p><P> May 28, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PEAK MOMENTS  </P> <P> What would it take to please Martin Bernheimer? I attended the Metropolitan  Opera's monumental production of Wagner's "Ring" cycle, and I suspect that few  in the international, musically sophisticated audience would agree with  Bernheimer's article in the May 7 Calendar.  </P> <P> Bernheimer nit-picks over details of the scenery and props, while failing to  give us an overall picture of the power of the performance.  </P> <P> The opera lover goes to the theater in hopes of experiencing those peak moments  in which he is, to borrow C.S. Lewis' phrase, "surprised by joy."  </P> <P> Alas, there is no joy in a Bernheimer review, and this time I fear that the  mighty critic has indeed struck out.  </P> <P> JULIA HEARD  </P> <P> Torrance  </P></p>

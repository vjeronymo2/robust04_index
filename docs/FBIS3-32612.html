The Armed Forces, and thus the Air Force, are traditionally  one of the basic guarantors of the electoral process, giving the  citizens the necessary security to vote freely," he said. He  added: "This is the way it is and this is the way it will be."    He stated: "An essential condition for this is the fact that  all military personnel on active service in the Air Force, from  the commander in chief to the lowliest soldier, must strictly  obey without exception this constitutional concept."

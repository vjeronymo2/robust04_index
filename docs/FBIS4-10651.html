			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Telemetro Reports" newscast] </F>   [Text] Seven hours before the awaited presidential  announcement, President Endara has again asked the Panamanian  people to be patient. He neither confirmed nor denied that the  announcement he will make tonight is linked to fellow party  members' involvement in a scandal involving duty free stores.    [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] Is the  announcement  you will make tonight linked to members of your party being  involved in the contraband scandal?    [Endara] I am not going to discuss that subject now. Please  be patient, you only have to wait seven hours.    [Reporter] Is the situation so critical that you have called  a special council [consejo extraordinario] meeting minutes or  hours before the announcement?    [Endara] Yes, I thought it was advisable, and therefore I  called a meeting yesterday. It was initially scheduled for  1600, but I had to postpone it until 1700 due to a last minute  appointment.    [Reporter] Is all this related to the announcement you will  make tonight?    [Endara] Yes, it has to do with the announcement.    [Reporter] Will they accompany you?    [Endara] Yes, they will accompany me. [end recording]</p>

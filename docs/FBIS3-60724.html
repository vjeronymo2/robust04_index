			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By UKRINFORM correspondent for TASS] </F>   [Text] Kiev December 16 TASS -- The press release  circulated here on Thursday [16 December] described as not  conforming to reality the reports by some mass media about the  critical condition of nuclear facilities on Ukrainian territory.  The press release was issued following an inspection tour of  units and facilities of the strategic missile forces by  Ukrainian Defence Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy accompanied by  officials responsible for the maintenance of nuclear facilities.  On a commission from the Ukrainian president, they visited  depots for temporary storage of nuclear warheads removed from  missiles to assess their condition.    ``There actually are certain maintenance problems,'' said  Vladimir Mityuk, commander of the 43th Army of the strategic  missile forces, who took part in the trip. ``And this is quite  explicable. But there are no grounds to lay it on thick. The  situation on nuclear facilities is fully under control, and we  have all necessary means and resources for this. Any attempts  at drawing an analogy to Chernobyl or anything of the kind is  absolutely inadmissible,'' he stressed.    According to Valeriy Vasilyev, commander of Ukraine's  strategic air forces, the nuclear ammunition is presently  ``preserved reliably.'' Although the air forces also face  certain problems, the situation is still far from critical.  Such assertions do not conform to reality, he noted.    The press release quotes Radetskyy as saying a package of  documents has been prepared for discussion at the proposed  meeting with the Russian defence minister. The main thing, he  believes, is the mutual desire of the two sides ``to find a  constructive solution to all existing problems.''    The press release assesses the present state of Ukrainian  nuclear facilities as satisfactory. Additional measures are  being taken ``to maintain nuclear warheads in proper conditions  and to provide strategic troops with all necessary things.''</p>

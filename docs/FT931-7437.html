			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / International Company News: Handelsbanken suspends pay-out after heavy loss SVENSKA Handelsbanken has slid to a higher-than-expected 1992 operating loss of SKr840m (Dollars 111m) and suspended the dividend on its ordinary shares after lending losses surged 150 per cent to SKr8bn. The deficit, which compares with a SKr2.78bn profit in 1991, is the first in the group's recent history and follows a dramatic deterioration in its performance in the final four months of the year. Nevertheless, the result is substantially better than that of its main competitors, and the group said the prospects for 1993 were brighter. In particular, it said non-performing loans totalled SKr15.5bn at the year-end, SKr1.5bn lower than at the end of the first eight months, the first indication of a downward trend since Sweden's financial sector crisis began. Mr Arne Martensson, Handelsbanken's chief executive, reaffirmed that the group would not be looking for state bail-outs to help it manage its problems. The figures confirm that Handelsbanken has the best credit portfolio of the leading Swedish banks, with a proportionally lower exposure to commercial real estate. Its rival, Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken, last week unveiled 1992 credit losses of SKr10.9bn, problem credits of SKr28.8bn, and an operating loss of SKr5.3bn. Nevertheless, Handelsbanken's credit losses climbed sharply from just SKr3.2bn in 1991 after doubling to SKr8bn, or 2.8 per cent of total lending, from SKr3.94bn in the final four months. The group blamed high Swedish interest rates in the autumn and the depreciation of the krona. Around 60 per cent of the bank's credit losses were connected to real estate, it said. Handelsbanken's capital adequacy ratio was unchanged at 10.1 per cent at the year-end.</p>

Heathcoat-Amory asked the Guatemalan official about the recent  letter of reservation sent to the UN secretary general, within  the framework of national reclamations over Belize.    Arevalo said the nonspecific portion of the letter was  addressed, adding the UK official requested an expansion of the  existing information on the official reservation the country has  made before the important organization.    "The requested information was explained to them, and the  issue was not further elaborated," the official explained.  Arevalo also reported the points of the bilateral agenda  discussed with Heathcoat-Amory during the meeting.    He said among the topics of discussion was the so-called San  Jose X Meeting between Central America and the European Union,  which will be held in Athens. Arevalo remarked Foreign Minister  Marithza Ruiz de Vielman will participate in the meeting,  because it will take place within the framework of the foreign  ministers meeting of both blocs to discuss economic and  cooperation matters.    In addition, during the meeting Heathcoat-Amory and Arevalo  exchanged letters establishing the elimination of visa  requirements for tourists traveling to and from the United  Kingdom to Guatemala.    The UK official's activities also included the inauguration  of the Anglo-Guatemalan Institute, as well as visits to the  Defense Ministry chief of staff, the human rights ombudsman, and  the head of the Government Peace Commission.</p>

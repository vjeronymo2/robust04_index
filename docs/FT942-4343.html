			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / Cruise industry charts mass-market course The cruise industry, a traditional preserve of the rich and retired, yesterday declared itself open to the mass market when P&amp;O Cruises cut its 1995 prices - in some cases to below their 1989 levels. Next Wednesday, Airtours, the determinedly mass-market package tour operator, announces plans for its first cruise ship which will begin sailing in 1995. Airtours yesterday pledged to 'revolutionise the market' when it unveils its prices. Mr Hugh Collinson, Airtours managing director, said: 'You've seen nothing yet. This is a different end of the market to where cruising has been before.' P&amp;O says the UK cruise market is growing at twice the rate of the overall foreign holiday market. Mr David Dingle, P&amp;O Cruises marketing director, forecasts the number of UK cruise customers will grow from the current figure of 250,000 a year to 700,000 by the year 2000. P&amp;O's price reductions have been made possible by the planned launch next April of Oriana, its new Pounds 200m cruise liner, which is being built in Germany. The introduction of the Oriana, which will carry nearly 2,000 passengers, will allow P&amp;O to offer cheaper cruises on its older ships, the Canberra and the Sea Princess. The Canberra will offer nine-day cruises next year from Pounds 575 - Pounds 10 cheaper than in 1989. A 12-day Mediterranean cruise for two adults and two teenage children will cost Pounds 2,877, which is Pounds 640 cheaper than this year. Airtours announced last April that it was buying a 752-berth ship from Closter Cruise of Norway for Pounds 16m, including refurbishment costs. The ship will offer Mediterranean and Canary Island cruises. Mr Dingle said P&amp;O's price reductions were planned before Airtours announced its ship purchase. He said P&amp;O welcomed Airtours' cruising debut. He said: 'What Airtours are good at is talking to a slightly younger, more down-market group of customers. They will put cruising in people's minds.' But Mr Dingle added: 'It is important that the image that they portray does not, how should we say it, reduce the glamour factor in cruising.' Mr Collinson said: 'I don't think we should confuse the new cruise market with a poor, down-beat product.' The cruise industry says the traditional view of cruising as being overpriced and for the elderly is already out-of-date. But Mr Peter Shanks, commercial director of Thomas Cook, which claims to be the UK's biggest cruise retailer, said he had customers who had been booking the same cabin on the Canberra for 25 years. Mr Shanks said, however, that the market had enormous scope for growth. Cruises represent only 2.7 per cent of overseas holidays from the UK. In the US the figure is 60 per cent.</p>

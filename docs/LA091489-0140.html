Greg  Jolley of the Las Vegas police.  </P> <P> McKinney, 23, the 119-pound gold medalist at the Seoul Olympics, remained in  jail on $12,000 bail Wednesday.  </P> <P> McKinney, who is 4-0-1 as a pro, was dropped by his handlers over a training  dispute after his last fight two weeks ago.  </P> <P> "He hasn't been in the gym since his last fight, so we terminated the  contract," said Fred Glusman, a restaurant owner who had served as McKinney's  manager.  </P> <P> Glusman said promoter Bob Arum has also severed relations with McKinney, who  was to fight next week in Jacksonville, Fla., before being taken off the card.  </P></p>

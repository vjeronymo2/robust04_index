			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / International Company News: Net income at T-D Bank declines 5% TORONTO-DOMINION Bank has suffered a 5 per cent drop in first-quarter earnings, confirming it is no longer the star performer among Canada's big six banks. T-D, harder hit by the recession than its main rivals, saw net income fall to CDollars 115m (USDollars 96.6m) or 35 cents a share, from CDollars 126m or 38 cents a year earlier. Return on equity slipped to 8.6 per cent from 9.8 per cent, while return on average assets fell to 0.68 per cent from 0.72 per cent. On international business, the return on assets was 0.28 per cent, down from 0.58 per cent a year earlier. Loan loss provisions were unchanged at CDollars 120m, but the portfolio of non-performing loans grew to CDollars 1.73bn from CDollars 1.34bn. A large chunk of the increase stemmed from business in Australia. The bank said net interest margin improved as lower interest rates widened domestic loan spreads. National Bank of Canada, smallest of the big six, reported first-quarter net profit of CDollars 49.8m or 32 cents a share, down 9 per cent from CDollars 55.3m, or 36 cents, a year earlier, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal. The bank attributed the decline to the long recession, continuing high loan-loss provisions and higher non-interest expenses, partly offset by declining interest rates and good results from the investment banking and brokerage subsidiary. Return on equity was 11.3 per cent, against 13.4 per cent, and return on average assets 0.53 per cent, compared with 0.60 per cent. Total assets at January 31 were CDollars 37bn, against CDollars 36bn a year earlier.</p>

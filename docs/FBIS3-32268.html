			<p>Article   Type:CSO     [Editorial Report] Managua LA PRENSA in Spanish of 9  January 1994 on page 12 reports that the National Development  Bank (Banades) will make available 1.296 billion cordobas in  loans to small and medium producers for the 1994-95 crop year.  According to the article, the bank will attempt to eliminate the  credit policy which concentrates the bulk of the available  resources in the hands of just a few growers. The bank estimates  that the new policy will reach an additional 9,700 customers for  a total of 42,700; interest rates will range between 16 and 18  percent. Silvio Baltodano, assistant credit manager at Banades,  says that the bank will target nontraditional products, and that  loans will be made to those in a position to pay off their  loans. According to the article, for short-term financing  Banades will devote 454.3 million cordobas for agriculture,  248.5 million for cattle, and 189 million for trade and  industry. Long-term financing will total 403.9 million cordobas.</p>

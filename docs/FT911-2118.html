			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / Bureaucrats in the heart of the battle: India's election campaign has taken on an anti-establishment tone - and one target is the elite civil service As Indian politics has grown more embittered over issues of religion, caste and regional autonomy, so the western-educated civil service that has piloted the country since independence is cracking under the strains. In the run-up to the general election during the week of May 20, the senior bureaucracy has come under attack on different fronts in campaigns that have a strong anti-establishment flavour: Former prime minister V P Singh's left-wing National Front alliance is campaigning on a programme that would reserve for the poor and lower castes up to 59 per cent of central government jobs. Mr Singh's revolutionary aim is to wrest control of the bureaucracy from the upper castes and thus diminish their grip on patronage and wealth. Hindu revivalists are angry at the Indian Administrative Service (IAS) - the elite service that heads the bureaucracy - for upholding secular policies that they regard as 'pampering Moslems'. The revivalists are contemptuous of the pro-western, modernising legacy of Jawaharlal Nehru which is reflected in the IAS. A growing number of regional movements blame the IAS - often called the 'steel frame' of the Indian union because it provides the link between the central government and the states - for the country's much-hated over-centralisation. The most recent factor in this growing impatience with the civil service is the current state of the Indian economy. Mismanagement has brought the country close to defaulting on its international debt and has focused attention on the shortcomings of the administration in steering economic development. The civil service is increasingly viewed as one of the major obstacles to change. Mr Sam Pitroda, the US-educated Indian electronics engineer who now heads the telecommunications commission, says: 'There are many capable, highly motivated bureaucrats. Individually they are innovative. But collectively they are a roadblock.' Most worryingly, senior officials seem themselves to have lost confidence in the system. Under pressure from ruling parties to adopt an increasingly partisan and political role, looked down on by business which feels that they easily succumb to bribes, pushed around by criminals who are openly seeking respectability by entering politics, the IAS has lost its reputation as a neutral, non-partisan institution. 'Why is it that bureaucrats like to lick the boots of politicians?' one senior official recalls being asked by one of the new, rough-necked politicians who had just taken up a post as a central government minister. In a recent issue of the Indian Journal of Public Administration devoted to the declining morale in government service, Mr S K Sarkar, a former IAS officer, begins an article by saying: 'As a member of the Indian Administrative Service, I have felt considerable anguish in recent years as a mute spectator to the impending collapse of the civil service in India . . .' One indicator of this downward slide is that the best and brightest of Indian university students are seeking careers elsewhere in management, with multinationals or in foreign banks. Above all, children of IAS officers shun a career in a service that was regarded under British rule and until recently as the pinnacle of achievement. Most new recruits to the IAS are now coming from the two northern states of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar - the largest of the 25 states and where corruption is most endemic and the collapse of administration most apparent. As the central government has grown weaker and more strife-prone, it has fallen increasingly to civil servants to keep the wheels turning. But it is increasingly clear that the civil service cannot function without political leadership, and that left to itself there is a risk of disruption and paralysis. If the election fails to produce a central government with a stable majority, the civil service will fall increasingly prey to caste, religious, regional, farmers or business lobbies. India has no tradition - as does France or Italy, for example  - of a civil service providing continuity in the face of political turmoil. However, if a strong government or coalition should emerge, then it is difficult to see how much-needed reforms - decentralisation, deregulation of industry and improving the performance of the public sector - can be achieved without an overhaul of the civil service. The paradox is that the civil service contains many able people but its performance has been poor. Its main defect since independence has been that it has failed to adapt the elitist structure left by a colonial power to the more diverse needs of a developing country democracy. Britain ruled India through the Indian Civil Service (ICS) - a hand-picked cadre of 1,000 men imbued with Victorian ideals of hard work, honesty and dedication, who provided a secretariat for the viceroy and managed districts the size of a small state. Some of that ethos is still preserved at Mussoorie, the hill station academy that trains recruits to the successor IAS service. They are still taught to ride 'as part of the old belief that if you can't ride a horse you won't be able to manage a district'. As a colonial service, the ICS was only concerned with tax collection and law and order. Since independence in 1947 the IAS has taken over most of the welfare and economic responsibilities of a modern state, including co-ordination of education, health and irrigation. Its numbers have only increased to 5,000 for a population that has exploded to 840m. It is thus overstretched. It presides over a mammoth bureaucracy that numbers 4m officials in the central government alone. Files can take months to move back and forth. The IAS recruits a third of its intake by competitive examination. Each year about 250,000 students apply to take the civil service exams of which about the first 100 are admitted to the IAS. In the hierarchy of the IAS, an officer moves up by seniority from a district post to being a secretary of government (in charge of a department) or even cabinet secretary. Each officer is attached to a state but is loaned at different periods in his career to the central government - a structure intended to minimise separatism in the union and establish a link between the centre and the states. Many senior civil servants blame venal, short-sighted politicians for destroying the IAS's reputation as an honest, non-partisan service. Others accept that 'civil servants have been their own worst enemies' - too often sycophantic, fearful of taking a stand against abuses, and financially profiting from their immense power. Mr Ajit Mazumdar, a former secretary in the finance ministry, sees the emergency imposed by Mrs Indira Gandhi in the 1970s to thwart opposition to her as a watershed. During that time, the administration failed to resist abuses of the law and constitution by the then prime minister. 'To our eternal shame none of us resigned,' he said, 'though we felt that wrong things were being done.' Since then both state governments and the central government have increasingly expected senior officials to promote the short-term political and financial interests of the party in power - transferring those who refused to toe the line. As one of the main instruments of economic development, the IAS has tended to be ultra-cautious - giving priority to issues of social justice and equitable income distribution over the willingness to take risks that accompanies higher economic growth. Part of that reluctance to encourage the risk-taking enterprises that promote a market economy is a legacy of British rule. After independence the government left in place a system of war-time controls to regulate industry and the economy. This went hand in hand with an acceptance of Fabian socialist beliefs. Intervention was seen as the most efficient instrument with which to accelerate economic development and to achieve social justice. Neither has been completely abandoned. But in the 1980s there were several attempts to shift towards a more market economy. Mr Rajiv Gandhi began his term as prime minister in 1985 with a reformist programme of economic liberalisation. A year ago, when warning signals were already flashing of an approaching fiscal and balance of payments crisis, Mr Montek Ahluwahlia, then chief economic adviser to Mr V P Singh, circulated as a cabinet paper a far-reaching programme of medium-term economic and structural change that linked deficit-cutting to financial sector and tariff reform. Both ran into opposition in the bureaucracy. Change in India must proceed at a pace that is 'politically and socially sustainable', says Mr Bimal Jalan, finance secretary at the time. Another senior official says: 'The system is not a speedy system and just as well. India is not a country on the fast track. It is too dangerous. There would be risks of arbitrariness, lack of fair play and injustice.' A gap in the system is that there is no mechanism for studying medium-term policy options. India has no think-tank with the weight to influence decisions, or a 'reforms commission' such as China introduced to co-ordinate economic change. The planning commission - the closest equivalent - is concerned with the long-term allocation of resources. A further problem is an obsession with bureaucratic procedures that puts a premium on civil servants finding fault and discourages innovation. 'I get more credit if I pitch in with an objection,' complains one official. The administration has found no way of rewarding performance and punishing inefficiency. Mr P K Basu, a former permanent secretary, discovered that by September 1989 cumulative delays on public sector projects in India had reached a staggering total of 515 years. But no official had been punished. Unlike France or Britain, where the best civil servants obtain rapid promotion, India does not have a 'fast track'. An IAS officer cannot expect to become a permanent secretary until he is 50 and he has to retire at 58. Poor salaries have encouraged corruption. In the 1930s a senior member of the ICS earned more than the chief justice of the US Supreme Court. But a permanent secretary now gets about Rs10,000 (Dollars 500) a month  - and retires on half the amount. Many senior officials have remained conspicuously poor and honest. But the service's reputation for corruption is such that the chance to make large sums of money illegally is the motivating force behind many students who seek to join the IAS from UP and Bihar. One other cloud hangs over the future of the service. Whatever government comes to power, popular pressure is such that the proportion of jobs reserved for the poor and backward castes seems bound to increase - with the consequent damage to efficiency that this type of protectionist measure entails. Twenty two per cent of jobs in the central government are already reserved for Harijans (untouchables). Attempts at reform of the civil service have so far come to nought - and are unlikely to succeed in the future without strong political leadership. The gravity of India's political and economic difficulties has none the less encouraged acceptance of new ideas. Prime Minister Chandra Shekar has talked of the need for smaller states. Mr L K Advani, the leader of the Hindu revivalist Bharatiya Janata party, has called for a presidential system. Mr V P Singh's National Front is urging greater decentralisation. But a big factor for change will be the pressure that the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and donor nations bring to bear on India to carry through the structural changes needed to achieve a more competitive industry and better export performance. As one Indian economist says: 'We are past the stage of gradualist change.'</p>

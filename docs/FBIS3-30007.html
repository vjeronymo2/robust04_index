Kong, in an interview with KYODO NEWS SERVICE, said South  Korea and Japan should maintain close cooperation in seeing that  North Korea accepts adequate international inspections of its  nuclear facilities to ensure against development of nuclear  weapons. He said settlement of the matter should be made a  precondition for consideration of North Korea's participation in  regional organizations and activities, such as the Tumen River  Development Project near the North Korea-China border and the  Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum.    Kong said Tokyo and Seoul still face unresolved issues, such  as addressing the suffering of so-called comfort women, who said  they were forced by the Japanese Imperial Army to provide sex to  soldiers during World War II. But he said South Koreans were  very touched last year by Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's  apologies for Japan's war conduct and its colonization of the  Korean peninsula.    President Kim is scheduled to visit Japan in late March.</p>

			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / Markets Report: Lira and French franc weaken on political worries Political developments caused both the lira and the French franc to weaken yesterday, writes Philip Gawith. Worries about the Berlusconi government falling lay behind the lira falling to a record low of L1,040 against the D-Mark. It eventually closed in London at L1,039, from L1,033 on Friday. The decision of Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, not to stand for the French presidency next year undermined the franc. It closed at FFr3.439 against the D-Mark, from FFr3.430. Amid quiet, pre-Christmas trading conditions, the other main movements were in German and UK short term interest rate futures, which exhibited generalised weakness. Sterling had a quiet day. It finished marginally weaker against the stronger D-Mark, closing at DM2.4597 from DM2.4601. Against the dollar, it closed at Dollars 1.564 from Dollars 1.5597. The dollar was weaker in Europe, closing at DM1.5728, from DM1.5773. Against the yen, it closed at Y99.875 from Y100.165. Most investors stayed on the sidelines, preferring to wait for market signals from US inflation releases, today and tomorrow. A New York Times report, suggesting that the Fed might wait until January, or early February (instead of next week), to raise rates, prompted some selling. The franc came under selling pressure as the market reacted to Mr Delors's announcement. Mr Julian Jessop, international economist at HSBC Markets, said the franc had weakened 'because Delors was seen as the candidate who would have pushed hardest for closer European integration. He was a strong supporter of the franc fort and, as the architect of the EMU convergence criteria, sound on the public finances and inflation.' He said Mr Delors would also have been the candidate most likely to defeat the right-wing leader, Mr Jacques Chirac. 'Mr Chirac is seen as much more sceptical about Europe and more willing to throw money at unemployment.' Mr Avinash Persaud, currency strategist at JP Morgan in London, said Mr Delors's decision had increased uncertainty in the short term, hence the selling of francs. 'The market is also saying that we will have a squabble among right-wing candidates, and could lead to lots of insults being hurled at the EU and the idea of a single currency' he added. In the longer term, Mr Persaud said he had 'no doubt that Mr Trichet (governor of the Bank of France) would keep the franc closely linked to the D-Mark, and monetary policy tight.' Lira weakness was prompted by comments from Mr Roberto Maroni, interior minister, and a member of the Northern league, who said he 'could envisage a different government, with a different leadership, and a different majority.' His comments came ahead of the appearance today, before magistrates, of Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the prime minister, to answer allegations of corruption. They also come against the backdrop of Mr Umberto Bossi, the Northern league leader, saying the governing alliance, of which the league is a part, must be reviewed. Mr Persaud said lira weakness was also due to renewed strength in the D-Mark, helped by recent data suggesting Germany's economy was one of the strongest growing in Europe. 'That is disturbing for other European countries because it means Germany may be raising rates much earlier than we had anticipated.' 'It would certainly jeopardise some of the higher yielding European currencies,' said Mr Persaud. Higher German interest rates would make it more difficult for countries like Italy and Spain to attract capital inflows. Analysts were unable to explain the movements in sterling and D-Mark futures. They stressed that volumes were low, making firm conclusions difficult, and hence not too much should be made of the moves. 'It was a case of mid-summer madness in December,' quipped one observer. The D-Mark contracts set the tone for trading, with sterling simply following suit. Traders said the pattern of German markets this week would be set by developments in the US, particularly the inflation data. The Bank of England supplied UK money markets with Pounds 936m of assistance, after forecasting a Pounds 1.1bn shortage. Overnight money moved between 4 1/2 and 7 1/4 per cent.</p>

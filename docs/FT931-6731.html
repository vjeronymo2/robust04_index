			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / Reshuffle option increases pressure on Lamont MR John Major is keeping open the option of an extensive cabinet reshuffle during the summer to restore the government's battered authority. His stance leaves a question mark over Mr Norman Lamont's hold on the Treasury and increases pressure on the chancellor to produce an imaginative budget on March 16. But the scope for a popular Budget package has been limited by a shift of mood in the cabinet towards an early increase in personal taxation to curb the public sector deficit and provide scope for new measures to help industry and the unemployed. Close associates of the prime minister dismiss recent suggestions at Westminster that he has decided to keep his senior cabinet colleagues in their present posts until 1994. Instead, Mr Major would review after the Budget possibilities for high-level changes before the summer parliamentary recess. The chancellor has indicated he would like to deliver both the March Budget and the second Budget due in November. The prime minister has refused to speculate on the possibilities of a summer reshuffle. His only comment to journalists returning with him from Washington this week was that a shake-up was not 'imminent'. That was interpreted as meaning it would not come before the Budget and probably not before the Commons third reading of the Maastricht bill in May or June. But the general view among Tory MPs at Westminster is that Mr Lamont has failed to recover his political authority since sterling's ignominious exit from the European Exchange Rate Mechanism last autumn. If he is moved - to the Home Office or defence - Mr Kenneth Clarke and Mr Michael Howard would be front-runners for the Treasury. Mr Major is also under pressure to bring in fresh talent to the government by dropping some longer-serving ministers inherited from Lady Thatcher. There is speculation at Westminster that one cabinet minister has indicated privately that he is ready to stand down and the planned departure of Mr Tristan Garel-Jones from the foreign office will leave vacant a post just below cabinet level. Among ministers of state tipped by Tory party managers for promotion are Mr Stephen Dorrell at the Treasury, Mr John Redwood at environment and Mr Roger Freeman at transport.</p>

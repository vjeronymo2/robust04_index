			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / Petrol retailers attack suppliers BRITAIN'S biggest oil companies were attacked yesterday by petrol station owners in a survey by the Petroleum Retailers' Association, Deborah Hargreaves writes. Retailers were highly critical of their dealings with oil companies at a time of big upheavals in the petrol market. Retailers face intense competition and tougher environmental regulations. More than half said oil company prices had not helped their profitability in the past year. More than 45 per cent expected to see profits fall this year. More than 40 per cent of the retailers said that the marketing advice they received from oil companies was unhelpful. Large operators - such as Shell, Esso and British Petroleum - fared worst in the survey. Mr Bruce Petter, director of the association, said the petrol industry was 'suffering a crisis of confidence'. It was of 'great concern' that oil companies' advice on staff and marketing was poorly regarded, he added. The association estimates that the number of petrol stations in the UK, at present 19,000, will fall to between 12,000 and 14,000 over the next two to three years. Competition from hypermarkets and the rising cost of environmental regulations would force out independent retailers, the association predicted.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Ulrich Rosenbaum report: "SPD Seeks Contacts With the </F> Economy"]    [Text] Bonn -- The Social Democratic Party of Germany  [SPD] presented a "memorandum for innovation policy in Germany"  yesterday, in which a "market-oriented industrial policy" was  announced for the event of an SPD election victory. The  document that was drafted by party leader Scharping and his  "shadow ministers" Oskar Lafontaine and Peter Glotz represents a  departure from the SPD's former ideas of a research that is  independent of the economy.    The memorandum explicitly states that the economy should be  granted "more influence on the priorities" in large research  institutions. The state and the economy are not living in  different worlds, and competition requires a "new understanding  of the industry" and "coordination and concerted economic  efforts by the economy and the state."    Glotz, who is responsible for research, education, and media  for Scharping's team, announced that, after an election victory,  the SPD wants to introduce regular talks between the economy and  the state similar to the ones of the Clinton-Gore  Administration. Independent advisers should participate. The  document that was presented was also prepared after talks with  all major organizations in the sphere of science and economy,  Glotz pointed out. The SPD criticized the decline of the  research budget, which was still 2.8 percent of the entire  budget under Helmut Schmidt, and which has now dropped to below  2 percent. Yesterday Scharping described this as a "serious  mistake in the field of economy and research" which has weakened  Germany's attractiveness as an economic base. The research  budget lacks a "consistent industrial orientation that would  make the goal of winning new growth markets over the medium term  realistic," the document reads. Referring to the nomination of  new ministers for research and education -- Minister Krueger  (Christian Democratic Union) and Minister Laermann (Free  Democratic Party of Germany), the SPD criticized that the  government considers these areas as "switchyards of secondary  importance." Scharping spoke of a "respectable but  unprofessional research minister."    Within the framework of its investment program, the SPD  wants  to promote particularly the medium-sized enterprises. Thus,  risk capital is to be provided for young and capital-intensive  technological enterprises. Tax privileges for future-oriented  investments are to be introduced, and permit procedures are to  be shortened. Germany needs a "new period of promoterism,"  Glotz stated.    The SPD called on the present government to go back on its  decision to cut the research budget by 250 million German marks  [DM] and to increase the funds for research and the construction  of universities in the new laender. If the government should  not comply with this wish, an SPD-led government will adopt  these measures. Scharping stated that another billion marks for  future- oriented research should not be a problem in view of a  total budget of DM480 billion.</p>

			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / International Capital Markets: Wall Street celebrates the arrival of spiders LARGE spiders will be suspended above the trading floor of the American Stock Exchange in downtown Manhattan this morning as it celebrates the launch of Standard &amp; Poor's Depositary Receipts (SPDRs), known as spiders. The new product allows investors to track the performance of the S&amp;P 500 stock index, and is aimed at luring business back to the ASE that has been lost to stock index funds - low-cost funds, sold by big investment groups, such as Fidelity and Vanguard, that are designed to match the investment returns of stock market indices. The chief attraction of spiders is that they mimic the performance of a stock index fund but, because they represent shares in a trust that holds all the important S&amp;P stocks, investors can buy and sell them quickly.</p>

			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Institutions back Ferranti board Both sides in the increasingly bitter battle over the future of Ferranti International, the defence electronics group, have begun marshalling their supporters ahead of next week's offer deadline. As expected, institutional investors are falling in behind the board, which is backing a 1p a share rescue bid from GEC. According to Ferranti, institutions controlling 28.6 per cent of the group's 936m ordinary shares and 20.6 per cent of its 79m special shares have said that, in the absence of a higher bid, they will accept the GEC offer. The institutions backing the bid include the three biggest shareholders, Phillips &amp; Drew Fund Management with about 10.4 per cent, Guardian Royal Exchange with 4.76 per cent and Prudential Portfolio Managers with 3.9 per cent. Other supporters include Electra Investment Trust and Co-op Insurance Society. Ferranti's 100 largest shareholders control 60 per cent of its equity and the next 8,000 speak for a further 30 per cent. The final 10 per cent is in the hands of about 40,000 individuals. GEC has said its will not proceed with the bid unless it receives acceptances covering least 90 per cent of the outstanding equity. If the bid fails, Mr Eugene Anderson, Ferranti's chairman, has warned that the group's banks will call in the receivers. Shareholders opposed to the Pounds 11.4m offer, which they have described as 'derisory', have formed the Ferranti Shareholders Support Association, chaired by Mr John Katz. The association, which claims a membership of some 230 shareholders speaking for more than 22m shares, said it had received letters and phone calls from more than 1,000 shareholders expressing opposition. It expects to speak for 35.5m shares by December 8, the closing date for acceptances.</p>

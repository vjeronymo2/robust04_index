The  118 Golden Venture illegal immigrants [IIs] deported to China  nine days ago are being held in Public Security Bureau (PSB)  offices in Fuzhou city. If their families cannot pay fines of  up to 20,000 yuan (HK$17,760 [Hong Kong dollars])--a massive sum  by normal mainland standards--they will be sent to re-education  centres.    Receipts obtained by the SUNDAY MORNING POST bear the stamps  of the Fujian Provincial Government and the Frontier Armed  Police Force of Changle County, a small administrative area 40  kilometres from Fuzhou. They show that the authorities fined  the illegal immigrants separately and a senior re-education  centre official in the Fujian capital admitted they would be  jailed if the cash was not paid.    The Golden Venture, with 286 illegal immigrants on board,  ran  aground off New York last June. Six mainlanders died when they  jumped from the ship in a desperate bid to escape from U.S.  officials. Many claimed they were refugees escaping the  strictures of China's one-child-per-family policy, a plea backed  by a U.S. federal judge last week when he ruled it provided  sufficient grounds for asylum in the U.S.. But his decision  came too late for the first batch of Golden Venture illegal  immigrants, and news of their harsh treatment seems certain to  fuel the heated debate on human rights abuses on the mainland,  and heighten demands for the U.S. not to renew China's Most  Favoured Nation (MFN) trading status.    Raising cash to pay the fines demanded by the authorities  has  already taken a high toll on some families. The wife of one  illegal immigrant said they raised the 20,000 yuan for the fine  by borrowing from a loan-shark--but the PSB refused to accept it  because her husband, Cheng Yiulin, was a second offender, and  said he must spend a year in a re-education centre.    Mrs Cheng, 26, said her husband had now been detained for a  week by the PSB. "They beat him up and now he has a stomach  illness," she said. "They also said he would be sent to the  re-education centre for a year." Pausing to light a  candle--their old, brick-built house has no electricity--she  continued: "My mother was very upset after hearing the news.  She hanged herself on Monday." The family tragedy has spread  even further--her mother-in-law has suffered a nervous breakdown.    Cheng Yiulin's journey on the Golden Venture was the second  time he had made an illegal bid to get to the United States.  His first attempt was last January with another in-famous II  ship, the East Wood. More than 524 Chinese were on the East  Wood when food and water supplies ran out in mid-Pacific. The  U.S. coast guard stopped the vessel as it neared Hawaii last  February and the Chinese were eventually sent home. Mr Cheng  was then fined 20,000 yuan, a sum which equalled the total  family income for five years. He received a similar fine when  he was deported by the U.S..    Mrs Cheng said they had paid the first penalty by borrowing  money from loan-sharks, but when it became obvious that they  would never clear the debt her husband decided to make a second  bid to reach the U.S. and make his fortune. "We could not go on  repaying the loan for the rest of our lives," she said. "The  only way out was for him to go to America."    With three children aged seven, six and four, his distraught  wife said all she was praying for now was a family reunion.  Even the children understood what was happening in the family.  Asked where her "Daddy" was, seven-year-old Dingshui said: "He  is now in jail. I miss him." Mrs Cheng cannot even see her  husband because she does not have the cash--"The PSB charges 30  yuan for each visit," she said.    The Chinese Government promised before the illegal  immigrants  were sent home that they would not be imprisoned or harshly  punished. Fines would be no more than 5,000 yuan, they said,  adding the returnees would be lectured and released. But  receipts shown to the SUNDAY MORNING POST and issued by Fujian  Provincial Government and the Fujian Frontier Armed Police  Force, reveal that at least one mainlander was charged 11,000  yuan.    The director of Rujiang Re-education Centre, Mr Liu, makes  no  secret of the fact the immigrants are jailed. "They (IIs) have  to do some work, there is no reason to lock them up everyday,"  Mr Liu said. "The time spent in re-education is not fixed, it  depends mainly on their performance."    It is believed most returning boat people are held in the  high-walled Rujiang camp, which is in a remote area about 20  kilometres from Fuzhou. And it is expected those from the  Golden Venture will end up at the camp as well. Mr Liu refused  to say how many boat people were in the jail and how they fared  once inside. However, it was learned that about 1,000 IIs are  being held in the centre and that they have to work on  construction, farming and the production of shoes.    The SUNDAY MORNING POST witnessed some inmates working on  the  roof of a building, and Fuzhou Labour and Education Bureau  lorries carrying footwear material into the camp. Sources say  the camp's main output is shoe soles which goes to Taiwanese  enterprises. Families of the illegal immigrants say they can  only visit their relatives once a month. Some of the IIs will  be sent to the Shui Tao re-education centre in Fuzhou. Camp  director, Mr Wang said: "It is normal that they have to work."</p>

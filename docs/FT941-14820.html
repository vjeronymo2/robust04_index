			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / International Company News: Renault Agriculture in tie-up with US producers Renault Agriculture, the farm machinery division of the French state-owned motor vehicle group, yesterday announced a series of agreements aimed at strengthening its position in the depressed farm equipment market. The French group has agreed with John Deere of the US to exchange tractors and diesel engines in the French market. It has also concluded an accord with Massey Ferguson, the farm equipment group owned by Varity of the US, to establish a joint design, development and manufacturing subsidiary and a joint purchasing operation. Under the terms of the agreement with John Deere, the world's largest manufacturer of farm equipment, Renault Agriculture will receive diesel engines from the US company's factory in Saran, south of Paris. In return, Renault will supply tractors equipped with John Deere engines to the US group. These will be sold under the John Deere marque. Renault declined to disclose the volumes concerned, but said the agreement with John Deere would satisfy a large proportion of its demand for engines. It said the deal would allow the two companies to operate at their French factories at 'a high level of activity'. The agreement with Massey Ferguson involves the creation of a joint subsidiary for development and manufacture in the areas of mechanical engineering, hydraulics and electronics. The subsidiary, to be jointly owned and managed by each of the partners, will be based at Beauvais, north of Paris. It will concentrate on the development and manufacture of transmissions. The two companies will also establish a common purchasing body.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Yi Kang-tok from Panmunjom] </F>   [Text] North and South Korea started the seventh round of  working-level contacts for the exchange of special envoys at  Tongilgak in the North side area of Panmunjom at 1000 [0100 GMT]  this morning. However, as the North side again demanded the  issue of announcing a joint communique, the contact is  undergoing difficulties [nanhang] in its initial stages.    In a keynote speech, Pak Yong-su, head of the North Korean  delegation, claimed that the North side's withdrawal of its  four- point demands during the sixth contact was an epoch-making  step and that the South side should therefore show a  compromising stance by accepting the North side's demand.  Noting that the two sides agree on the principle of exchanging  special envoys, he again proposed that a joint communique be  announced.    To this, Song Yong-tae, senior delegate of our side, said  that procedural matters for exchanging special envoys should be  settled in consideration of the urgency resulting from the lack  of time before 21 March, when the third round of North  Korea-U.S. talks are scheduled to be held. He put forward a  compromising plan [cholchungan] which stipulates the issue of  achieving national reunification based on the three-point  principles of independence, peace, and great national unity,  which includes the missions of the special envoys, as well as  the principle of great national unity and national independence  which the North side proposed additionally.    Delegate Song Yong-tae stressed that our side's compromising  plan has taken the North side's opinion into full consideration  and is designed to promptly resolve the disputed problems, to  finalize the date of exchanging special envoys, and to settle  all procedural matters.</p>

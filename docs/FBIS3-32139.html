			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Garfield Myers] </F>   [Text] Kingston, Jamaica, 2 Feb, CANA -- An increase in the  number of foreign exchange dealers, a 25-million U.S. dollar  bond issue, and differential interest rates are among new  measures announced by the Jamaica Government to stabilise the  local dollar and boost the troubled economy. But the opposition  Jamaica Labour Party (JLP) is already claiming the measures will  fail.    "Nothing in the presentation will alter the present course  of  the economy or halt the slide" of the dollar, insisted  opposition leader Edward Seaga in response to Prime Minister  Percival Patterson's address in parliament late Tuesday.    Since June last year, the Jamaica dollar has slipped from  what was then a relatively stable rate of 4.5 U.S. cents to just  over three U.S. cents. The slide has fuelled high inflation of  three percent a month in the last eight months, seriously  increasing economic hardships for the majority of Jamaicans. At  the same time, anti-inflationary measures by government have led  to a hike in commercial interest rates to well over fifty  percent, dampening the investment climate in the process.    Patterson announced that in a bid to increase the flow of  hard currency through the official system, unify the currency  exchange rate, and reduce currency black marketeering and  tourist harassment, authorised dealership in foreign exchange  would be expanded in "two parts."    First, a "cambio system" would be introduced, incorporating  more than 100 hotels which currently buy hard currency from  tourists through foreign exchange bureaux. The prime minister  said that under the new system, hotels would be licensed "to buy  and sell foreign exchange, 20 percent of which will be sold to  the Bank of Jamaica" (central bank).    Secondly, the more than 20 merchant banks operating here  will  be given limited foreign exchange dealer status. This will allow  them to take foreign currency deposits, make foreign currency  loans, borrow foreign currency abroad, and arrange foreign  currency lines of credit for their customers.    The merchant banks will be able to "access" the foreign  currency facilities of the development credit banks to "support  ... the export sector and thus improve the supply side of the  economy," Patterson reported.    The oil refinery, Petrojam, will also be given a limited  foreign exchange license in order to meet its oil importing  requirements, according to the prime minister. He stressed that  with the new measures, laws against black market currency  dealers would be strictly enforced.    Under existing laws, people buying and selling hard currency  without a permit may be subject to heavy fines or imprisonment.    Patterson also announced plans to float a U.S.25 million  dollar foreign exchange bond, expand the lending capacity of the  Exim Bank by 50 million Jamaican dollars, lower lending rates by  developing banks, and provide differential interest rates for  small farmers and small businesses, in order to encourage  production.    He said the proceeds from the bond issue would go to the  National Development Bank and the Agricultural Credit Bank for  on-lending to the productive sector. Negotiations were taking  place with international lending agencies including the World  Bank to find "a compromise" that would allow for the  differential lending rates. The various multi-lateral lending  agencies on which the Jamaica economy is dependent have  steadfastly opposed such measures in the past.    Patterson renewed promises made to exporters last month that  effective April 1, all import duties on raw materials for the  export market would be removed, manufacturers would be allowed  to accelerate capital depreciation of machinery over two years,  and there would be a tax credit of 25 percent on the nominal  value of bonus shares issued from the profits of a company, to  expand its equity base.    While Patterson appeared optimistic that the new measures  would work and that the Jamaican economy was on track to  recovery, opposition leader Seaga poured scorn on the  initiatives. He said the increase of the number of dealers in  the market will not increase the flow of foreign exchange into  the official system but will only "ensure that there will be  even more dealers" in the hunt.    "What this will do is create even more pressure on the rate  of exchange, as more "dogs" chase the same "bones." What the  economy urgently needs is more "bones" not more "dogs," Seaga  said.</p>

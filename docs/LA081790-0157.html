			<p><P> August 17, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> GOLETA;  </P> <P> FOUR RESCUED AT SEA AFTER PLANE CRASHES  </P> <P> Oil platform workers rescued four people from the Pacific after their  single-engine plane crash-landed nine miles off the coast of Santa Barbara,  authorities said.  </P> <P> The only injury was a slight cut over an eye suffered by the pilot, Jack Loomis  of Goleta, said Will Bailey, foreman on a Texaco drilling platform. A worker on  the platform spotted the plane's tail in the water, and a rescue boat was sent,  Bailey said. "They were cold and disoriented," he said. "We let them shower,  fed them and a helicopter flew them to a hospital in Goleta for observation."  The plane had left Santa Barbara for a sightseeing tour over the Channel  Islands.  </P></p>

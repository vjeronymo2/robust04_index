			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / Observer: Grand Met's German guru Professor Gertrud Hohler cannot find any women she thinks good enough to work for her Berlin-based corporate communications strategy consultancy. So she should get on famously with Sir Allen Sheppard, chairman and chief executive of Grand Metropolitan, who has just invited her to join the board as his fifth non-executive director. Sir Allen, readers will recall, was quoted (he now says misquoted) in June as saying any woman joining his board would need 'an operation' to come up to the standards of his four other illustrious non-execs. 'That was before he met me,' Hohler says serenely. The Paderborn literature professor-turned-communications strategy guru is the result of a 14-month search for a continental European, and preferably female, dimension to a board which Sir Allen believes is in danger of becoming an 'Anglo/Irish/American club'. Author of 14 books - the latest entitled 'Rules of the Game for Winners' - she has just caused a stir in Germany by appearing in American Express's 'famous card-member' campaign; she is pictured in a book-lined room, with a besuited man lying flat on the floor in front of the desk. Her views on German management can be on the irreverent side. A consultant for Deutsche Bank for three years during the Alfred Herrhausen era, she merely rolls her eyes heavenwards when asked about employee relations at the bank. By contrast, the 1988 holder of the City of Aachen's Anti-Deadly Seriousness Award enthuses about the more relaxed and flexible approach of her prospective British colleagues. Big on concepts such as 'emotional added value', most of Hohler's oeuvre has been read by Grand Met non-exec David Simon, the fluent German-speaking chief executive of BP. But is she not perhaps a touch too theoretical and abstract for the straight-talking no-nonsense Sir Allen? 'I am highly theoretical too. I'm just so quick I look practical,' he says modestly.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Artem Yerkanyan report: "Kurds Ready for Compromise"] </F>   [Text] A news conference organized yesterday by the  Kurdish Professionals of Armenia Council, the Kurdistan  Committee, and the newspapers RYATAZA and BOTAN was devoted to  the events of the current stage of the national liberation  movement of the Kurdish people and also to the attitude toward  the Kurdish question of the governments of Turkey and Western  states.    A purpose of the measure was to explain the propositions of  the appeal of Abdulla Odzhalan, general secretary of the  Kurdistan Workers Party [RPK], to 35 states, in which the RPK  leader states once again his readiness to renounce power  methods. "We would welcome all initiatives aimed at a peaceful  solution of the Kurdish problem and are prepared to embark on  their discussion without any conditions whatever," the appeal  says. It follows from that same document that the RPK does not  insist on the obligatory dismemberment of Turkey and would  discuss all proposals of the Turkish leadership concerning  mutual compromise, including the possibility of a federal  arrangement of Turkey.    The participants in the news conference--Amarike Sardar,  editor of the newspaper RYATAZA, the poet Karla Mad, and the  scholar Sharafe Ashir--dwelt in detail on the position of their  compatriots in Turkey and this state's policy in respect to the  Kurdish people. The parliamentary elections in Turkey on 27  March were seen as a fraud. In the eastern provinces, in which  the Kurds live, the elections were conducted under the pressure  of a beefed-up contingent of the armed forces. A parliament  formed under such conditions cannot be legitimate.    The anger of Armenia's Kurdish community at the world  community's reluctance to recognize the seriousness of the  problem is intensified by the avowedly anti-Kurdish actions  taken by the governments of certain European countries. The  leadership of the FRG was subjected to particular criticism. The  Ministry of Interior of Germany has banned the local Kurdish  community from celebrating the Novruz national holiday. As a  sign of protest, two young Kurdish women committed an act of  self-immolation in the West German city of Mannheim.    The questions put by the journalists concerned both the main  topic of the news conference and the disagreements within the  Kurdish community connected with the separatist sentiments of  the Yezidi Kurds.</p>

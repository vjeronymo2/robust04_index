			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / Survey of Sweden (3): Two notable triumphs - Interview: Ingvar Carlsson Ingvar Carlsson, 60, took over as prime minister and leader of the Social Democratic party in early 1986 after the assassination of his predecessor, Mr Olof Palme. In 1991, as Sweden spun towards a deep recession, he lost power to Mr Carl Bildt, leader of the conservative Moderate party, who declared that the long dominance of the Social Democrats and the universal welfare state they had built was over. But Mr Carlsson led his party back to power in September's general election, pledged to defend the welfare model. Less than two months later, Mr Carlsson chalked up a second notable triumph when he won the battle to persuade Swedes to accept membership of the European Union in a national referendum. With these victories behind him, Mr Carlsson can now turn to the urgent task of tackling Sweden's mounting state debt - soon to exceed 90 per cent of gross national product - and bringing down unemployment presently running at 13 per cent of the workforce. Hugh Carnegy asked Mr Carlsson to outline his government's primary objectives: Mr Carlsson: Very clearly to stabilise the total debt, get over the economic crisis and stimulate economic growth and get down unemployment. Doesn't this amount to a rather defensive agenda? I don't think so. Unemployment in Europe is too high and to say that we want to attack that unemployment and do it now together with other member countries in the Union - that is not defensive. It is very important long term for a progressive society to solve these problems. The financial markets are sceptical that you can balance your commitment to defend the welfare system with the need to cut the budget deficit. How can that be done? Let us now see what we are doing. First, the former government reduced the budget deficit by SKr18bn. In addition to that we have now a proposal in parliament reducing the deficit by another SKr57bn and we have proposed to parliament the financing of the fee for EU membership of SKrI8bn. And we have said in January there will be around SKr20bn, mainly in cuts. Honestly I don't think that the market is aware yet of what we are doing. But they will see the facts. This means we will stabilise the total Swedish debt before 1998 - which was what we said in the election campaign. I think it is possible already in 1997. And when the market sees the total effect of these proposals that will definitely mean a stronger currency for Sweden and also a lower rate of interest. The Social Democrats are in a minority in parliament. How stable is the government? We have 46 per cent of the mandates and there are six parties in parliament  -all the way from the conservatives over to the Left and the Environment parties. When we look at our proposals we usually find at least one, and very often several, of the parties supporting us. We are as secure as a formal minority government could be. I think we have very good chances (to survive the four-year mandate period). What role will Sweden play in the EU? We will be very ambitious. We will be active. We will take responsibility. We will accept decisions taken and follow them, but we will also come with concrete proposals, particularly to fight unemployment in Europe and to fight environmental problems. We will be active supporting the three Baltic states becoming members. And of course, now Norway is not coming in we will try to see to it that Norway still will be in close and good co-operation with the EU. What action will you propose that the EU should take on unemployment? I think what is in the EU Commission's Employment White Paper on investment is a good start - investments in infrastructure, roads, railroads; plus better labour market policies. I think Sweden has something to contribute here with our experience on active labour market policies. Instead of paying cash to people, put it into active measures. We should have much more on education. Not just for youth and universities, but recurrent education, bringing people back from the factories into education, giving them a better chance in languages, electronics, information technology and all that. Sweden is a neutral country. After the end of the cold war, some Swedes argue that neutrality is dead - that joining the EU means Sweden will inevitably shift towards joining a western European security alliance. No. I don't agree with that. The parliament has said - and all parties agree with that - that we are militarily non-aligned, able to be neutral in case of war in our neighbourhood. And that's a reality. It's a parliamentary decision and the government is sticking to that. We are not leaving our present position without knowing where to go. The Western European Union as it looks today, with the resources it has today, is no alternative. I think it is not in the interests of Nato, it is not in the interests of Sweden to change the basic security policy in northern Europe. We have had a very stable situation in northern Europe for many years with the kind of security policy we have had so far and I think it could be a dangerous policy to give Russia the feeling that we are encircling them. Of course, we also have to say that with the Berlin Wall torn down in 1989 we have a completely new security position in Sweden. The old, very difficult policy for us between east and west - that's gone. We are in former Yugoslavia with more than 2,000 soldiers; we are actively taking part. So it is a different situation. But when you come to the core - are we prepared to give up the military non-alignment - the answer is no. What is Sweden's attitude towards building European Monetary Union? I am personally in favour of stronger co-operation in monetary policy but the formal position of Sweden, both the present government and the former government, is that before saying yes to that co-operation we must know what it really will mean in reality and we don't know that yet. That is also what Germany has said: but I see personally that there are good arguments for increased co-operation. But I don't want to take specific positions. There are problems with (creating a common currency). I think we have to increase co-operation but the ways and means to do it have to be discussed further.</p>

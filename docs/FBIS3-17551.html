			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Aleksandr Krasulin report: "Pyongyang Intends No </F> Concessions"]    [Text] The U.S. statement on the holding of the "Team  Spirit `94" military exercises with South Korea, the rejection  of a third round of talks with the DPRK on nuclear security on  the Korean Peninsula, and the intention to submit for  consideration by the UN Security Council a resolution on  economic sanctions against North Korea if its authorities do not  allow the International Atomic Energy Authority [IAEA] to carry  out a repeat full inspection of nuclear facilities and refuse to  exchange special envoys between North and South have been  assessed in Pyongyang as an attempt to exert blatant pressure.  This was said in a 21 March DPRK Foreign Ministry statement,  whose contents were announced to journalists Tuesday by Son  Song-pil, DPRK ambassador in Moscow.    The document notes in particular that, in its demands, the  United States has gone considerably beyond the bounds of the New  York accords of 25 February and is "proceeding on the basis of  its former policy of a hostile attitude toward Korea"; the  failed IAEA inspection is being used as a pretext to "isolate  and stifle the DPRK."    The ambassador also announced that under the complex  conditions of holding an extraordinary inspection of nuclear  facilities, the Korean authorities did everything possible to  make it a success. As for the analysis samples which IAEA  specialists failed to obtain from one laboratory, the Korean  side gives an assurance that the agency's control instruments  installed during a previous inspection are still there, and the  IAEA seals have not been broken.    He stressed that, since the United States and the IAEA are  using the results of the inspection to exert pressure on the  republic, the DPRK no longer considers it "its duty to provide  uninterrupted guarantees for the IAEA." "We will not be making  any unilateral concessions, and if Washington takes tough  measures we will be forced to respond appropriately. We are  still ready for a dialogue, but if the United States chooses a  military way to solve the problem, we will respond in kind," Son  Song-pil stressed. "In this complex situation America should  make a more realistic assessment of the possible consequences."    The ambassador warned of the danger which could be posed by  the ending of the negotiating process. In this event the DPRK  would be forced to carry out the government decision --  currently in abeyance -- to withdraw from the Nonproliferation  Treaty. This, in his opinion, could lead to the galvanization  of nuclear developments in a number of other countries, which  are already near-nuclear-capable, and, as a result, to the  breakdown of the entire system of nuclear arms control.    It seems as though the United States is not ruling out the  possible use of military force in the Korean question. THE  WASHINGTON POST reports that, apart from the plans to increase  the U.S. military contingent and to deploy another 48 Patriot  surface-to-air missile systems in South Korea, it is also  planned to redeploy USN aircraft carriers closer to the Korean  seaboard.    At the same time, the United States is trying to find UN  allies to support its policy in regard to Pyongyang. Naturally,  without the help of Japan, China, and Russia, any restrictive  measures would be ineffective. On Monday, Albright, U.S.  representative to the United Nations, met with delegates from  the UN Security Council countries. A draft resolution calling  on North Korea to agree to all the IAEA inspectors' demands was  discussed, and soundings were taken on the attitude of Britain,  France, Russia, and China toward sanctions against Pyongyang.  According to Radio Liberty, Russia and Britain supported the  U.S. position. France opposed tough measures, and China  abstained. We would recall that each Security Council member  has the right of veto -- consequently, the agreement of all of  the "big five" is needed for sanctions to be imposed.    In the opinion of Professor James Morley of Columbia  University, the Security Council members may be able to draft a  resolution in general terms, but they are unlikely to reach a  unanimous view on the use of sanctions. It is hard to imagine,  he stated in an interview with a Radio Liberty correspondent,  that China, Japan, and even South Korea would agree to military  action. Clearly, Russia would give its verbal assent to the  resolution, but would hardly want to get involved in military  operations.    The leaders of the Russian foreign policy department are  themselves being quite restrained in their statements on the  subject of Korea. Thus, commenting on recent talks with  Japanese Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, Aleksandr Panov, Russian  Federation deputy foreign minister, stated that "both sides  consider it necessary to main permanent contact, to continue  talks on the DPRK nuclear problem, and, possibly, to seek some  new approaches, since current approaches have proved  insufficiently effective."    Western observers are in practice failing to take account of  the Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Aid between the DPRK and  Russia, to which the latter is party as the successor to the  former USSR. At the same time, they are not ruling out the  possiblity that the Russian Federation may adopt some kind of  independent stance on this issue, as was the case recently on  Sarajevo.    Judging by everything, Washington does not expect any  immediate exacerbation of the situation on the Korean Peninsula.  Confirmation of this was the Pentagon decision to send the  Patriot systems by sea rather than by air. The idea is that  this will not only allow Washington to defuse the political  tension with respect to this step, but will clearly also give  the DPRK time to review its position vis-a-vis a full inspection.</p>

			<p><P> December 8, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> AQUINO ASKS UNITY AGAINST MUTINEERS;  </P> <P> PHILIPPINES: CHEERING CROWD OF 100,000 TURNS OUT AT RALLY TO SUPPORT HER  BELEAGUERED REGIME.  </P> <P> President Corazon Aquino urged Filipinos at a rally today to unite against  those who would "destroy our democracy" as a crowd of 100,000 turned out to  support her beleaguered regime.  </P> <P> Aquino said she will not relinquish her office to Vice President Salvador  Laurel, who was elected on her ticket but has become a political rival. He has  suggested that they both resign and call new elections.  </P> <P> Aquino also pledged to investigate whether opposition Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile  was involved in the military coup attempt that began Dec. 1.  </P> <P> "He cannot wait to be president," Aquino said of Laurel. "I will never give up  this position to him."  </P> <P> The president spoke to a rally on the site where hundreds of thousands of  Filipinos filled the streets in 1986 so tanks could not pass.  </P> <P> Today's crowd was smaller than those in 1986, but appeared to be among the  largest since Aquino gained power. Government offices encouraged employees to  attend, and participants were brought by bus from as far away as Angeles, 50  miles to the north.  </P> <P> Estimates of the crowd varied widely. Government television said 1 million  people attended, but reporters put the number at more than 100,000.  </P> <P> Aquino did not mention complaints by the rebels and other critics that she has  not delivered on promises of social justice and reform.  </P> <P> She delivered most of the speech in Tagalog, the main Philippine language,  using an earthy accent and phrases associated with uneducated Filipinos. Her  style recalled the simplicity and frankness that won millions of Filipinos to  her cause in 1986.  </P> <P> Speaking briefly in English, Aquino said: "I want all of us to unite and to  give support to the democratic systems of government and to go after these  people who want to destroy our democracy, who want to destroy our economy, who  want to destroy the Filipino people."  </P> <P> The crowd cheered wildly and chanted "Cory! Cory! Cory!" when she mentioned  Laurel and Enrile, whom she fired as defense minister in November, 1986, after  a coup by his followers failed.  </P></p>

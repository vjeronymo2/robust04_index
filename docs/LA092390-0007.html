			<p><P> September 23, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENTS: A GUIDE TO THE BEST OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA;  </P> <P> HIGH STYLE;  </P> <P> RATTAN COMFORT  </P> <P> IN THE 1980S,the design pendulum swung away from hard-edged chrome and  stainless steel chairs toward a rounder, softer, more romantic look. If  modernist furniture represented masculinity, contemporary chairs -- in  particular, wicker -- exemplify the return of the feminine.  </P> <P> The 1908 Sears catalogue showcased 13 busy-looking wicker rockers; the  top-of-the-line, $6.65 version, was death by curlicue: Overwrought to the point  of hysteria, it bristled with fancy scrollwork and a continuous roll extending  over the back, arms and under the seat, where it evoked love handles. Did Czech  designer Borek Sipek have this rocker in mind when he designed his Prorok chair  ($1,250)? Never mind that the sinister, black, curving frame conjures up the  image of a carapace of a giant insect; the Victorian love handles and the  wicker's sensual and nostalgic appeal bestow a level of comfort that transcends  the physical.  </P> <P>  The Prorok, Modern Living, 8125 Melrose Ave., Los Angeles; (213) 655-3898.  </P> <P> DAVID LASKER  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 18 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Premier Li  Peng is always seen carrying a small notebook during the ongoing  session of the National People's Congress (NPC) whenever he  attends group discussions by NPC deputies.    He took notes while listening to opinions and suggestions  voiced by deputies about his report on government work.    During the past eight days, the premier has attended  discussions by seven deputy delegations.    According to one of his aides, 18 pages of the premier's  notebook have so far been filled, with the opinions and  suggestions of 34 deputies.    Said the premier: "The National People's Congress provides a  good opportunity for government officials to learn about popular  concerns."    During the same period, Vice-Premiers Zhu Rongji, Zou  Jiahua,  Qian Qichen and Li Lanqing, and other members of the cabinet  also joined deputies in their discussions and listened to their  opinions.    On many occasions, the premier made a point of inviting  deputies from grassroots units to speak up, and those invited  did not refrain from speaking their mind.    Li jot down the main points of whatever they said, be they  criticisms or suggestions.    The premier said: "Some problems raised by the deputies  cannot be solved immediately, but their opinions are good for  revising the government work report and reducing errors in our  work."    No matter how busy he is during the day, the premier always  sorts out his notes at night, the aide said.    As early as when he worked in the former Ministry of Water  Conservancy and Power Industry, Li Peng had the habit of taking  notes, according to those familiar with the premier.    Since he took office as premier, Li Peng has always carried  a  notebook wherever he goes, even on his visits to foreign  countries. Besides the notebook, the premier has an electronic  calculator with him, which he uses to check figures and amounts  for "quantitative analyses."</p>

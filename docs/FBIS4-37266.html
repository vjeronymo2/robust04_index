			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by "a responsible source at the Defense </F> Ministry of the Democratic Republic of Yemen"; place and date  not given]    [Text] The ruling military regime in Sanaa has continued to  defy and ignore all the positive Arab and international efforts  to bring about a cease-fire in Yemen. The latest of these were  intensive efforts by Egypt and its president, Muhammad Husni  Mubarak, to arrange a meeting between representatives of the two  parts of Yemen in the Egyptian capital, Cairo, which should have  been held today.    However, since early this morning the forces of the ruling  military regime in Sanaa have resumed their random shelling and  rocketing of peaceful residential areas in the city of Aden to  kill civilians -- women, children and the elderly -- and destroy  their homes. This follows the failure on the part of these  forces to realize their strategic military ambitions of  occupying our territory and forcing our people in democratic  Yemen to submit to the adventurist authority of Sanaa by force  of arms.    Also since this morning the forces of the ruling military  regime have continued their attempts to advance towards Aden,  but our defending Armed Forces repulsed them and prevented any  advance by these enemy invading forces. Battles are continuing  on all fronts following the refusal by the ruling military  regime in Sanaa to listen to the voice of good sense and logic.  Instead, it chooses to press on with its adventurist hostile  operations against our people.</p>

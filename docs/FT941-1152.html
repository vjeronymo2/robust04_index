			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Gladiators give boost to Hornby The Gladiators swung into action last year to help Hornby, the games, model trains and boat maker, to report a small rise in 1993 pre-tax profits from Pounds 1.46m to Pounds 1.5m. However, turnover was 10 per cent down from Pounds 31.3m to Pounds 28.2m, with a corresponding fall in operating profits from Pounds 1.82m to Pounds 1.64m. Mr Alan Cox, finance director, said the UK market had been very difficult. However, sales of the Gladiator range, based on the television series and launched in August, had been very good, and were expected to continue successfully this year. Hornby model railway sales were ahead, while Scalextric model racing car sales had held steady. The two account for over half the group's sales. Net interest payable fell from Pounds 364,000 to Pounds 134,000, reflecting a fall in capital expenditure and lower seasonal borrowings. About two thirds of sales are made in the second half, so the group pays no interim dividend. The final dividend is maintained at 9p from earnings of 10.9p (11.5p). The group, which ended the year with net cash of Pounds 4.3m (Pounds 3.1m), reduced its operating costs from Pounds 8.8m to Pounds 7.3m. But the savings were offset by weaker sterling, which took about Pounds 900,000 off the profits compared with 1992. Many of its toys are imported from the East Asia and paid for in dollars. The Fletcher speed-boat business broke even on turnover of around Pounds 3m.</p>

			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Vegetable marketing 'failure' in the UK WHEN IT comes to marketing vegetables, UK growers do not know their onions, according to a report by Food From Britain published yesterday. Vegetables accounted for more than Pounds 1bn of the UK's Pounds 5.4bn food and drink trade deficit last year. Yet vegetable growers in the UK, while generally larger than competitors, suffer from a lack of top quality products and fragmented sales organisation. The UK makes no significant exports. Supermarkets now account for 50 per cent of the UK market for vegetables, leaving only 50 per cent traded in traditional markets compared with 90 per cent in 1980. Contracts with the supermarket chains have raised the standard of presentation and produce in the UK. But 'the concentration of buying power within so few organisations means that significant exporters to the UK can readily contact the key people.' This has been seized upon by growers in the Netherlands, where 90 per cent of produce is sold through auction markets. The Dutch system meets the need for additional supplies of the right quality and quantity to meet fluctuations in demand, according to one quoted UK buyer, whose remarks are 'a damning criticism of the way our marketing is organised,' FFB concludes. At the same time changes in Government policy have effectively cut research spending in half to Pounds 13m since 1989. FFB is also concerned that the Government does not see its role as 'a positive force to enable things to happen in agriculture to the same degree as the governments of other (EC) member sates, but rather as an administrator.' Compared with other countries, the 'UK vegetable sector is in the 'also rans,' partly from lack of a strong base to fund raise and partly from lack of product to sell,' says the report. It recommends a drive towards exports, more research spending, attention to quality and the promotion of a healthy image to counter a decline in vegetable consumption. As for those onions, more co-operation is needed. 'The Tasmanian onion farmers have just six export companies to ship out 60,000 tonnes to the rest of the world. The UK has more export organisations to ship out just 10,000 tonnes.'</p>

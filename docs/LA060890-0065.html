			<p><P> June 8, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST : BONITA  </P> <P> A Bonita motorcyclist who struck and killed a nurse while she was jogging  pleaded guilty Thursday to vehicular manslaughter.  </P> <P> Just as his case was about to be assigned to a courtroom for trial, Jerald  Covey, 30, entered his plea before Superior Court Judge William Mudd.  </P> <P> Stephanie Rossi, 29, a mother of three, was jogging on Sweetwater Road near the  Chula Vista Municipal Golf Course on Nov. 5, 1989, when Covey's motorcycle hit  her.  </P> <P> The case resulted in verbal barbs between the California Highway Patrol, which  arrested Covey and mistakenly let him leave a hospital before his blood alcohol  level could be tested, and the district attorney's office.  </P> <P> Sentencing was set for July 19.  </P> <P> Covey could be sentenced to a maximum of four years, although Deputy Dist.  Atty. Jennifer Yackle said her office does not oppose a one-year jail term on  the condition that his driving and alcohol consumption are restricted.  </P> <P> Yackle said that, if Covey is granted probation and a one-year sentence, he  could be sent to prison for four years if he violates any terms of probation  involving drinking and driving.  </P> <P> Covey was taken to a hospital after the accident because he was injured.  However, he had not been given a sobriety test. Covey walked out of the  hospital before being tested.  </P> <P> The defendant was recaptured about 3 1/2 hours later, and his blood alcohol  level was found to be .10%. He remains free on his own recognizance.  </P></p>

			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / Royal Commission on the Environment: Heated debate warmed further - The details of the commission's proposals It is a measure of the depth of the commission's research andits radical proposals that, for all the leaks which preceded its publication, its report still impressed observers with the strength and breadth of its arguments. Industry yesterday rejected the proposals to increase the cost of road use and reduce spending and it is unlikely to accept the commission's costings of its proposals. But the report's findings can be expected to make an important contribution to the increasingly heated discussion of the environment and the car. Dr Brian Mawhinney, transport secretary, responded with a call for 'a national debate about whether we are prepared for the costs and changes in our transport habits that will result'. The commission has no doubts about the scale of the problem to be solved. 'Pollutants from vehicles are the prime cause of poor air quality that damages human health, plants and the fabric of buildings,' it says. 'Noise from vehicles and aircraft is a major source of stress. The transport system must already be regarded as unsustainable. We believe this is . . . of such importance that it justifies placing significant restraints on the future evolution of the transport system.' Hitherto most of the environmental costs have fallen on the community rather than the users or builders of the transport system, the report says. The true costs must become more apparent at the point of use through increases in fuel prices and perhaps, later, through road pricing. But planning policies, too, must seek to bring about a shift away from lifestyles which depend on the extensive use of cars. One effective way of changing policies and public behaviour is to set targets, for example, to reduce vehicle emissions, road accidents or increases in rail use. These targets become the framework for more detailed strategies. The commission's detailed proposals to improve air quality so that it fully meets World Health Organisation guidelines by 2005 include tougher annual MoT tests of emission levels; collaboration between the government and the oil industry to develop cleaner fuels, and encouragement for the use of natural gas and electric-powered vehicles. To cut carbon dioxide emissions it wants tougher targets to be set and higher duty to be levied. This will encourage car manufacturers to design cleaner cars and motorists to buy them. The tax rules for company cars should be modified to reduce incentives to drive long distances. The commission recommends creating more passenger transport authorities, including one for London. Developers could be charged for the environmental costs of any traffic their projects generated. Transport assessments must weigh roads against a public-transport alternative and not merely seek the most effective road scheme. Trunk-road planning, now treated separately from local road networks, should be integrated to give local authorities better control of the entire road network in their area. Greater protection must be given to land with a low economic value but with a high value in conservation, cultural or scenic terms. If such land is needed for road-building, the developer must provide an equivalent area for public use, the report says. Much of the report looks at the impact of the private car on the environment  -but lorries have, if anything, a disproportionate impact. Freight shipments should be taken off the roads and rail's share of the freight market should rise from 6.5 per cent to 20 per cent by 2010, it says. There are already grants to encourage commercial users to move to rail, but they are small and may need to be increased or backed up with other measures, the commission says. To reduce car use in towns more bus lanes should be provided and new tram systems encouraged. Parking strategies should reduce use of private cars and networks of safe cycle routes must be developed. Restrictions should be placed on lorries of more than 17 tonnes in town centres. Most of the commission's proposals relate to surface transport but a section on aviation recommends the introduction on a Europe-wide basis of a levy on airline fuel to reflect the environmental damage caused. More stringent noise standards should be brought in for new aircraft. The commission estimates that the increases in fuel prices and the other measures would limit the growth of passenger and freight transport to about 10 per cent a decade, the maximum level which can be sustained without damaging the environment. Without the entire package of measures, fuel prices would have had to have been increased even more sharply, the commission warns. But this would be unfair and probably less effective. As it is, lower-paid people, who often do not own cars, should benefit from improvements in public transport. 'There is now an opportunity to take the difficult policy decisions which will lead . . . to a sustainable system of transport,' the report says.</p>

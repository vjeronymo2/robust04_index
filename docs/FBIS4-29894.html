			<p>BFN     [Text] The criminal maneuver by the U.S. imperialists and  the South Korean puppet clique to wage a war to invade the North  under the pretext of our nuclear issue has reached an extreme  point. The U.S. imperialists and the puppet clique are babbling  about a cooperative system in the nuclear issue, and are  generally assuming a posture of actual warfare aimed at an  offensive attack against the North.    At the National Assembly's National Defense Committee  meeting  on 9 June, the so-called puppet defense minister proclaimed that  the puppet army has entered into a 24-hour emergency alert  system. The puppet clique indefinitely prolonged the measure to  strengthen the posture of military preparedness, which was  carried out from November of last year to late March of this  year. As such, all of the puppet army is under an emergency  alert preparedness day in, day out.    The U.S. Forces occupying South Korea have also taken the  posture of 24-hour alert preparedness, and the reinforcements of  the U.S. imperialist aggression forces are thoroughly prepared  to be committed to South Korea at any time. In addition, the  U.S. imperialist aggression forces have completed preparation  measures for a possible war on important U.S. military bases  including the Osan airport and facilities, and they have  completed storage of spare ammunition and oil. Also, a hot line  has already been installed between the U.S. defense secretary  and the puppet defense minister and is currently in use.    The puppet clique is accelerating to reorganize the local  reserve force, the puppet army's detached force, so that it can  play the role of a professional army in preparation for wartime.    The U.S. imperialists and the puppet clique are continuing  to  drag in up-to-date murderous weapons and equipments into South  Korea. In March, 18 up-to-date Apache helicopters for offensive  use, which is a scale of one battalion, was dispatched to South  Korea. Currently, plans are being promoted to increase it to  three battalions. War equipments of each branch of the service  including antitank missiles, up-to-date moving radars, and  vessels are continuously being brought into South Korea.    This year, the U.S. imperialists and the puppet clique are  examining to take the posture of being prepared against the  North step by step and according to scenario. In April, U.S.  Defense Secretary Perry flew into South Korea, examined  on-the-spot the new strategy plan 5027 to attack the North, and  gave new orders.    The U.S. imperialists and the puppet clique are all the more  crazily carrying out military exercise aimed at a simulated war  to invade the North. Under the instigation of the U.S.  imperialists, the puppet clique carried out the first half of  this year's joint strategic exercise in mid-May jointly by the  puppet Army, Navy, and Air Force, and conducted various war  exercises including air maneuvers, landing exercises, and  anti-aircraft and antiship exercises in the northern part of  Kyonggi Province and Korea's West Sea near the Military  Demarcation Line on a large scale.    All facts show that the U.S. forces occupying South Korean  and the puppet army have assumed a full-scale posture to invade  the North, thus the situation on the Korean peninsula has  reached a touch-and-go stage.</p>

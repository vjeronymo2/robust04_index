Thanking them for their support, Zedillo said he favored honest  elections and respect for the citizen's vote.    [Begin Zedillo recording] As the PRI's presidential  candidate, I promise to respect the electoral law reliablely and  honestly. Today I confirm, before my party colleagues and the  entire nation, that I will assume each and every one of my  party's commitments in favor of electoral democracy. [end  recording]    Zedillo reiterated he will not accept any illicit votes and  demanded that there be an external audit of the electoral  register. He said he will heed the decisions, reached by  consensus, on the presence of foreign visitors at the elections.    The PRI candidate said he is prepared to debate other  presidential candidates and added that PRI members do not fear  democracy. Zedillo observed that lasting economic progress and  social improvement can only be achieved in a democratic system.    At the meeting with the legislators, candidate Zedillo  appointed new PRI Secretary General Ignacio Pichardo Pagaza as  the general coordinator of his political campaign.    Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon also met with CTM  [Confederation of Mexican Workers] leaders and promised to  defend the workers' rights. He said he will allow changes to  the labor law that will benefit Mexican workers and added that  their benefits will not be withdrawn.    [Begin Zedillo recording] The time has come for wages to  improve in Mexico. We can do this without risking the stability  that has cost us so much. We will do it by improving  productivity and making sure the benefits that result from this  productivity end up in the Mexican workers' pockets. [end  recording]    As he arrived and when he left the CTM auditorium, the PRI  candidate hailed all PRI members gathered there.</p>

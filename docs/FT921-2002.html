			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / Europe joins the Mickey Mouse club: Euro Disney must overcome the climate and competition from US counterparts to achieve commercial success In his office on a corridor labelled White Rabbit Run, off Dormouse Drive, Mr Robert Fitzpatrick, president of Euro Disney, is adamant that he will not be blackmailed. Sixteen French building contractors say that Euro Disney owes them money. Some have issued veiled threats that they will disrupt Euro Disney's grand opening on April 12. Mr Fitzpatrick is examining their claims. But, he says: 'I think it is important to tell these companies they can't get away with sloppy work.' The outburst is angry, but uncharacteristic. Generally, Mr Fitzpatrick is as unflappable as the floor-to-ceiling Mickey Mouse tapestry on the wall of his office at the nearly completed resort at Marne-la-Vallee, 32km east of Paris. The 16 companies aside, he is delighted with the progress of Euro Disney. He has reason to be. He will not need to reset his brightly coloured 'countdown to the magic' wristwatch which tells him how many days there are until the opening. Large construction projects, such as the Channel Tunnel, almost always open late, having overshot their initial budget. But Euro Disney, Europe's largest leisure complex, featuring such attractions as the Big Thunder Mountain Railroad and Dumbo the Flying Elephant, is set to open on time and to its budget of FFr22bn (Pounds 2.26bn). In the five years since Disney, the US film, entertainment and merchandising giant, signed an agreement with the French government to construct Euro Disney, it has assembled 700 contractors and an additional 1,000 suppliers to build 30 theme park attractions, a man-made lake, two rivers, six hotels with a total of 5,200 rooms, a campsite, a golf course and an entertainment centre. Most of the contractors had not worked for Disney before; 95 per cent were European. At peak building periods, there were up to 89 cranes on the 1,500-acre site and 11,500 construction workers. To welcome a projected 11m visitors in the first year, Euro Disney has recruited a staff of 14,000 'cast members', representing 75 nationalities and speaking 40 languages. And this is only the start. Disney has plans for its French site which will take it up to 2017. They include the opening in 1995 of Disney MGM Studios-Europe, with film and television production facilities and a movie theme park; a convention centre; a water park; a second golf course; and 13,000 more hotel rooms. Euro Disney has not been the only impressive performer. From the covered, moving walkway which will carry visitors from the 12,000-space car park to the site, the roof of a brand new RER suburban-line railway station is visible. Due to open at the beginning of April, it will enable visitors to reach the park from central Paris in 40 minutes. A station for the high-speed TGV train, located inside the resort, is expected to open in 1994. The co-operation of the French government in providing the infrastructure to serve the park has been crucial to Euro Disney's initial success, Mr Fitzpatrick says. The planning and work has continued under four prime ministers: Mr Laurent Fabius, Mr Jacques Chirac, Mr Michel Rocard and Mrs Edith Cresson. Each of them appointed an 'interministerial delegate' to ensure co-operation between Euro Disney and all the public authorities involved. According to Mr Fitzpatrick, who helped organise the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics, a dispute with a handful of contractors is relatively insignificant in a project the size of Euro Disney. There have been other pin-pricks. A French labour inspector has asked a judge to examine the legality of the Euro Disney Look, the company's dress code. This stipulates that cast members must wear 'proper undergarments'; that hair must not be bleached, tinted, frosted or streaked; that moustaches and beards are not permitted; that 'due to close contact with guests and fellow cast members, the use of a deodorant or antiperspirant is required'; and that 'sunglasses are a block to interpersonal communication with the guests and should be avoided when possible'. Staff are told that 'as a condition of your continued employment with Euro Disney, you are responsible for maintaining an appropriate weight and size'. Mr Fitzpatrick says he is confident the Euro Disney Look conforms with French law. Turning the 14,000 new employees into Disney cast members does, however, present the company with a new challenge: it has never had to manage a multinational workforce before. Its two theme parks in the US, in Orlando, Florida and near Los Angeles, employ mostly Americans. Its third park, Tokyo Disneyland, which opened in 1983, employs Japanese. Of the European employees, 66 per cent are French, 11 per cent are British, 4 per cent are Dutch and 3 per cent are Irish. French and English are the two languages of Euro Disney. Although bilingualism is not an absolute requirement of employment, 80 per cent of the staff speak English and 80 per cent speak French. The question of whether European employees will take to Disney's celebrated service-with-a-smile culture provokes a second flash of irritation from Mr Fitzpatrick. The quality of service at Euro Disney is already 'fantastic', he says. The idea that such standards are not achievable in Europe is 'a Euro-myth, a self-defeating, self-critical myth that astonishes me. It's not a question of nationality. It's a question of the company and what it values. You communicate in a thousand different ways what are the values of the company.' Mr Fitzpatrick says he leads by example. If there is litter on the ground he picks it up. He gives every appearance of living up to Disney's squeaky-clean image. It would be churlish to point out that he smokes. Like all other members of staff, he wears an oval plastic badge, with a picture of Mickey Mouse at the top and his name, Bob, in large letters in the middle. As the Euro Disney Look says: 'We are a first-name organisation.' When he walks around the site, he says, French staff give him a cheery 'Salut, Bob.' However, the cast members being conducted past the pink timber exterior of the Disneyland Hotel a few weeks before opening, look anything but cheery. Squinting into a howling wind, they clutch the hoods of their coats around their faces as protection against the driving rain. And this is March. What will January be like? The north European climate looks like being the biggest potential obstacle to Euro Disney's success. Unlike many other European theme parks, Euro Disney will be open all year round. Euro Disney says it has worked hard at overcoming the difficulties posed by the gloomy Parisian winters and unreliable summers. Building on the experience of Tokyo Disneyland which, the company says, has to cope with even worse weather, many of Euro Disney's attractions will be indoors. Ticket booths at the entrance to the park will be under shelter on the ground floor of the Disneyland Hotel. The park's Main Street USA will contain indoor arcades running parallel to the street. Mr John Forsgren, chief financial officer, says that good winter attendances will be crucial to Euro Disney's success. For much of the summer, Euro Disney expects to be bumping up against its daily capacity of 60,000 visitors. Improving annual profits will therefore depend on increasing winter visitors. In the company's first financial year, to September 1992, Mr Forsgren expects the company to be profitable after interest payments, although he will not put any figure to his forecast. Mr Paul Slattery, an industry analyst at Kleinwort Benson in London, says that in the first year, which does not include a winter season, he expects Euro Disney to have net profits of FFr246m. He does not expect much improvement in the second year, which includes both a winter and a summer season. Mr Forsgren agrees that Euro Disney will do well to break even in the period between October 1992 and March 1993 and might make a small loss. If attendances are low in the winter, Disney will offer special events and prices to attract visitors. The problems of the winter do not seem to worry shareholders. Since Euro Disney's hugely over-subscribed offering of 51 per cent of its equity in October 1989, the shares have shot up from FFr72 to close in Paris yesterday at FFr161.2. At this level they are a very expensive 130 times greater than expected first-year earnings per share. The performance of the shares worries Mr Forsgren. 'It's a bit much. We've actually been cautious with investors. We've asked people to be realistic about what we can achieve in the first years,' he says. Mr Forsgren, formerly treasurer of the parent Disney company, says, however, that communicating with European investors is more difficult than many US executives realise. 'The markets in Europe are much less efficient than in the US. The process of conveying information is much slower. You don't have the security analyst coverage you have in the US. You can't assume that, having made a statement in a speech, all the major investors are going to get that message. You make a speech in London and, two months later, it's news in Germany.' He says that Euro Disney could break even with as few as 8m or 9m visitors a year. The key would be a reduction in labour costs. The high turnover in theme park staff makes it relatively easy to reduce employee numbers when necessary, he says. 'Some people join with the intention of staying only for a season. Others simply decide they don't like the work. For whatever reason, it happens in a fairly new company.' Despite the economic downturn which is affecting much of Europe, Euro Disney says it is confident it will meet its first-year target of 11m visitors. Half are expected to come from France, with guests from the UK, Germany and the Benelux countries making up the rest. Travel companies seem equally confident. P&amp;O Ferries says it has already sold between 70 and 80 per cent of the Euro Disney holidays it has available for the first three months after opening. British Airways Holidays says it has sold about 40 per cent of its summer Euro Disney holidays and about 25 per cent of the packages available for the first year. P&amp;O's packages range from Pounds 50 per person a night to more than Pounds 90, depending on the class of hotel and time of year. British Airways' packages, which include air fares from the UK to Paris, range from Pounds 83 a person per night to more than Pounds 100. Euro Disney says it expects visitors to stay for a shorter time than European guests at its US theme parks. A winter trip to Walt Disney World in Florida, already popular with UK and German visitors, is, however, not much more expensive. Packages range from Pounds 65 a night to Pounds 160. Mr Forsgren believes that Euro Disney's main competition will come from the alternative attraction of European living rooms with television sets in them. During a grim European winter, however, the Florida sunshine might be more enticing than either Euro Disney or television. Euro Disney's stiffest competition might turn out to be its sister parks.</p>

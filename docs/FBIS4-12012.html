			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Algerian President Liamine Zeroual left Tunisia  this afternoon after a two-day official visit at the invitation  of President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali. He was seen off on  departure from Tunis-Carthage international airport by the  president.    Following the visit, a joint statement was issued. The  statement said that during the visit, in which the Algerian  president was accompanied by an important delegation, the two  presidents held comprehensive talks where the spirit of  understanding and friendship and the belief in a common destiny  prevailed. The talks showed much harmony in the points of view  on bilateral, regional, and international matters discussed.    Regarding bilateral relations and ways of strengthening and  promoting them on the basis of the strong political will of the  two leaderships, the two presidents praised the achievements  made in the process of enlarging existing spheres of fruitful  common cooperation and their diversification in a way that will  serve the aspirations of the two brotherly Algerian and Tunisian  peoples and achieve their longing for more development and  strength in a climate of solidarity and integration.    The two presidents noted with great satisfaction what the  two  brotherly countries achieved in the border demarcation issue and  considered it a great achievement embodying the spirit of  brotherhood and good neighborliness that built a strong bridge  of fruitful cooperation and interaction between the two  countries in faithfulness to their common history.    Presidents Ben Ali and Zeroual hailed the creation of  several  economic and social joint projects, particularly within the  framework of the development of areas on the borders between the  two countries. They stressed their determination to carry on  bolstering this fruitful cooperation and their eagerness to  guarantee the viability of the joint projects and make the  Maghreb Bank for Cooperation an effective instrument to finance  these projects. In this context, they agreed to convene the  11th session of the Higher Tunisian-Algerian Joint Committee in  September 1994. The two presidents also stressed their strong  commitment to the progress of the two countries on the path of  democracy, pluralism, the promotion of human rights, and the  establishment of the civil society by preserving the  constituents of the Arab and Islamic identity and promoting  values of tolerance that are the pride of the Muslim religion --  distinct from all aspects of fanaticism, isolation, and  extremism. The joint Tunisian-Algerian statement added that  in their review of the progress of the building of the Arab  Maghreb Union, the two heads of state blessed the important  steps the Union had made.    They extolled the new push the sixth session of the  Presidential Council had given to the Maghreb march. They  reaffirmed their determination to continue to support the  Maghreb edifice as the best way to rise to the challenges that  are thrown up by the developments on the international stage and  to embody the ambitions of the Maghreb peoples toward progress  and invulnerability in the shadow of solidarity, integration,  and merger.    Regarding the situation on the Arab and international  levels,  the presidents renewed their concern over the continuation of  the crisis between the Libyan Jamahiriyah and some Western  states. They stressed the need to work together to find a  peaceful, just, and honorable solution to this crisis; a  solution that will secure the interests of all sides on the  basis of respect for international legitimacy and safeguard the  Libyan people's sovereignty and dignity. They reaffirmed the  importance of continuing efforts to rebuild trust and harmony in  Arab relations and to establish firm and stable foundations for  these ties based on respect for the sovereignty of countries,  their choices, and the well-being of their entities and  cooperation to utilize all these resources to serve joint  interests.    They also confirmed their full support for the Palestinian  people in their struggle to regain their legitimate rights,  which include self-determination and setting up their  independent state on their land, with Jerusalem as its capital.  They denounced the barbaric massacres, particularly the Hebron  mosque massacre, committed against the Palestinian people.    Presidents Zine El Abidine Ben Ali and Liamine Zeroual  confirmed the importance of solidarity between Arab and African  peoples and the effective role of the Arab League and the OAU to  boost and develop cooperation to serve joint interests.    They noted with optimism the steps achieved to lift the  apartheid regime from the people of South Africa and to lay the  foundations for a new epoch based on a just, democratic, and  multiracial system.    The two heads of states expressed their deep interest in  coordinating positions on security and cooperation with  Mediterranean countries. They said they supported the  initiative calling on Arab states overlooking the Mediterranean  sea to coordinate between them to reach a unified stand  reflecting their interest in making peace and tranquility  prevail in this region.    The Tunisian-Algerian joint statement added that the two  presidents welcomed their talks on the situation in  Bosnia-Herzegovina and the agreement between Bosnian Muslims and  Croats, saying it was the first step toward ending the tragedy  of the people of Bosnia-Herzegovina. They stressed the  necessity that international and UN efforts continue to ward off  Serb attacks, protect the sovereignty of country -- which is a  member of the United Nations -- and preserve the right of its  people to exist and live in peace and security.    President Liamine Zeroual expressed his admiration for  Tunisia's revival in all fields under the wise leadership of  President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali. [passage omitted]    He invited President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali to go on an  official visit to Algeria. The invitation was accepted and a  date will be set later.</p>

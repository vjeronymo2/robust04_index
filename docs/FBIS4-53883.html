			<p>BFN     [Text] A new political party, reportedly set up to  accommodate defectors from the Phalang Tham Party, was formally  unveiled yesterday. Founding member Phiraphong Thanomphongphan  said his Lak Siam (Siam Principle) Party submitted its  application for registration to the Interior Ministry last week.    Phiraphong, a former Phalang Tham MP for Bangkok, said his  party has a lot of support among businessmen, permanent  officials, ordinary citizens, and politicians in existing  parties.    Phiraphong said the party registrar is expected to endorse  the application today and Lak Siam is ready to begin recruiting  members. Phiraphong was seen yesterday visiting the office of  Deputy Prime Minister and Phalang Tham Leader Bunchu  Rotchanasathian several times before holding his press  conference at Government House.    It was rumoured earlier that Phiraphong's party was being  established for defectors from the Phalang Tham Party,  especially those holding Cabinet posts and those who joined the  Phalang Tham just before the last general election. Speculation  was that most Phalang Tham ministers are disliked by members of  the party's powerful religious wing, who want them out.    When asked about the rumour, Phiraphong had a question of  his  own: is Phalang Tham close to collapse? Phiraphong said Lak  Siam's leader will have to be capable of working in either  opposition or government.    Unconfirmed reports said Lak Siam had earlier failed to  recruit former prime minister Anan Panyarachun to head the party.</p>

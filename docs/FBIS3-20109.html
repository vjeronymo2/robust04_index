			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Vittorio Sivo report: "Labor `Pole' Born"] </F>   [Text] Rome -- It was rather impressive to see them all  sitting side by side, exchanging comments and smiles, and to  hear them talking in the plural -- "we want to tell the  country...," "we are convinced...," "we have decided..." --in a  chorus of voices without a single discordant note. Two days  before the elections, Luigi Abete, Bruno Trentin, Sergio  D'Antoni, and Pietro Larizza [respectively, General  Confederation of Italian Industry, Confindustria, chairman;  Italian General Confederation of Labor, CGIL, secretary; Italian  Confederation of Trade Unions secretary; and Italian Federation  of Trade Unions, UIL, secretary] chose the foreign press center  to celebrate a very special event -- the collapse of the  symbolic iron curtain that has always, despite any agreements,  separated the public statements of Confindustria and the trade  unions. Now their joint news conference and joint statement,  read out by a trade unionist on behalf of both sides, suddenly  made the conflicts and controversies of years of stormy  relations seem part of the distant past.    "We are here together to issue a message of calm and  stability to the country," said the Confindustria chairman. "We  are here as independent organizations that have sometimes been  in conflict; nobody intends to relinquish his own role. But at  this time of delicate transition from the First to the Second  Republic, we feel a shared responsibility for guarding the 23  July 1993 agreement, which represented not a mere episode but a  radical change of course in the entire system of industrial  relations," the CGIL secretary explained.    To [President] Scalfaro, who received them jointly yesterday  morning, the industrialists and trade unions' representatives  addressed the following request and promise: first, that the  president act as guarantor of the continuity of the "heritage of  rules, methods, and objectives" embodied in last July's  protocol; second, an offer of a guarantee by both sides --  industry and labor -- to keep their conduct "consistent" with  the agreement signed almost a year ago. An agreement, as they  pointed out, that has hitherto ensured "strong social stability."    From both the president and from [Prime Minister] Ciampi,  whom they visited the previous day, the Confindustria and trade  union representatives received "not formal reassurances, but  committed replies," as Trentin explained, "from people who, like  us, believe that we must protect one of the most important  experiments that Republican democracy has managed to produce."    Was this unusual move dictated by the fear of a leap into  the  unknown represented by the elections? This suspicion was also  voiced by foreign reporters, who were as amazed as everyone else  by the spectacle of so much concord and who are accustomed to  the seeking after recondite causes typical of Italian politics.  "Do not lower the tone of this initiative by asking the usual  question about `what lies behind it,'" Abete began. "What I  mean is that next Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday [29-31 March,  following elections] will be normal, calm days," the  Confindustria chairman said, as though to suggest that nobody  believes that the barbarians are at the gates. "If we were  gripped by fear, we would not be here together," Trentin said;  "instead we would be waging a war of communiques. The fear, if  any, is that since the future will not be easy -- because the  next government will face some very tough decisions -- the  fabric that we began to weave last summer will become unraveled."    To state forcefully, as Luigi Abete did, that "agreements  must be honored" and, as Trentin, D'Antoni, and Larizza did,  that "the rules established by the July protocol cannot be  changed without a consensus," does not mean using some kind of  "blackmail" against the future government. "This is no kind of  pressure on the next government," the UIL leader said, "but a  confirmation of an option that remains valid, irrespective of  the outcome of the elections."    The message grew clearer when it became apparent that it was  also addressed to the international markets: "We want to  communicate that we are very confident of our capabilities and  our strength," Confindustria Deputy Chairman Carlo Callieri  summed up. "We want to tell the country and the international  public that they can depend on Italy and that Italy can depend  on itself."    There was such an attitude of deference that nobody wanted  to  claim credit for being the first to propose the establishment of  a common front. It is no sudden move, but the result of a long  shared task, a policy of consultations ratified by the August  1992 agreement. The idea was born one evening a month and 10  days ago, "when the five of us met," Callieri revealed. And it  was precisely in order to ensure that the joint move was not  misinterpreted, Abete explained, that Confindustria and the  trade unions agreed in rejecting the possibility of deferring  their joint statement until after the election.    The next government, whichever it may be, was asked not to  jeopardize the policy of reform started by the Ciampi  government, partly thanks to the July protocol. "The fall in  inflation, the lowering of interest rates, and the interest  shown by foreign markets," the joint document states, "have  enabled enterprises to exploit the regained competitiveness of  the exchange rates to make a considerable recovery in exports,  in terms of volume, shares, and margins, with a significant  change of direction in the balance of trade. Unfortunately,  however, the actions to facilitate a recovery of employment have  proved less effective." But Confindustria and the trade unions  are demanding a number of most urgent measures from the present  government: additional regulations covering public contracts, a  report on unemployment, an inquiry into labor costs, and an  assessment of the three-year research plan.</p>

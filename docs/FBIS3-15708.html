He  said this to journalists at the end of his meeting today with  the heads of both television companies, which he described as  difficult but interesting.    The president had a brief meeting with journalists following  the ceremony of laying wreaths at Yuriy Gagarin's grave.  Replying to an ITAR-TASS correspondent's question, Yeltsin  reaffirmed his position set out in the president's annual  message to the Federal Assembly to the effect that the first and  second programs should be state-owned. Otherwise, Yeltsin  believes, we may lose it, it may be broken up by various parties  and currents.    The Russian president said that he had today received from  Aleksandr Yakovlev a milder draft of the edict and an  aide-memoire on this question. Oleg Poptsov also presented him  with an aide-memoire. In Yeltsin's opinion, the head of Russian  Television is of the opinion that the Russian channel should be  state-owned. Yeltsin noted that it was not just a question of  the problems of television, but of the development of political  processes in the country.</p>

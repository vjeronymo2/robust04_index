			<p><P> June 29, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> A SUMMER SIEGE;  </P> <P> CARBON CANYON HAMLET HIT HARD BY FIRESTORM  </P> <P> La Vida Hot Springs Cafe on Carbon Canyon Road is a local institution where  millionaires rub elbows with bikers over barbecue and beer.  </P> <P> But on Wednesday, flames came within 100 feet of burning the storied  establishment that was built on the site of a 19th-Century stagecoach stop. The  fire late that night roared over a ridgeline and from around a bend and seemed  intent on devouring the restaurant.  </P> <P> "Get out of there, Don!" one female bystander yelled at restaurant owner Don  Himes after he ran in to retrieve some belongings.  </P> <P> The firestorm destroyed or damaged 14 homes and blackened 6,640 acres before  being contained Thursday, but the restaurant was spared.  </P> <P> The scenes of fear and panic gave way Thursday to a weary cleanup and  accounting of losses at the site of the Carbon Canyon fire. A 29-year-old  transient has been arrested on suspicion of starting the fire, which caused  widespread devastation in sensitive natural areas on the Orange-San Bernardino  County line.  </P> <P> In addition, more than four miles of telephone cable were burned, knocking out  service to about 900 Pacific Bell customers. Crews were working Thursday to  restore telephone service in the stricken area. Southern California Edison also  lost two power poles and a cellular phone tower, and Southern California Gas  has abandoned service in the affected area until the fire is extinguished.  </P> <P> Eight firefighters suffered minor injuries. About 400 firefighters remained on  the fire lines Thursday.  </P> <P> In Riverside County, meanwhile, a blaze started by the U.S. Forest Service to  reduce fire hazards in the Cleveland National Forest got out of hand and  charred 2,200 acres above Corona, destroying 12 structures, including some  homes, and temporarily shutting down Interstate 15. Eleven firefighters  suffered smoke inhalation and heat exhaustion.  </P> <P> That blaze, called the Bedford Canyon fire, was declared 40% contained late  Thursday as it burned toward non-populated areas in the wilderness. Fire  officials had no estimate on when that blaze would be brought under control.  More than 500 firefighters were working in steep terrain with hand tools and  bulldozers to build fire lines around the flames.  </P> <P> In the Chino Hills, residents evacuated from two communities were allowed to  return to their homes Thursday afternoon, and the seven-mile Carbon Canyon Road  was reopened to traffic. About a dozen residents of Olinda Village in Brea and  122 residents of Sleepy Hollow in San Bernardino County spent Wednesday night  at Red Cross shelters.  </P> <P> Fire threatened but did not touch Olinda Village, a bucolic community of about  500 residents, although horses became so frightened by the swirling smoke that  they broke a corral at the Hidden Valley Ranch on one end of town. Deer,  rabbits and other wildlife could be seen racing in advance of the flames, some  singed from the fire.  </P> <P> Many of the 200 residents of Sleepy Hollow, a hamlet hardest hit by the Carbon  Canyon fire, returned to a scene of devastation. Once-lush hillsides were  blackened with ash and the skeletal remnants of trees. At least 12 homes in the  community and surrounding Chino Hills neighborhoods were destroyed by fire, and  another two sustained damage.  </P> <P> "This is the worst one we've ever seen," said longtime Sleepy Hollow resident  Don Brinay, 63, a retired engineer who saved his stucco home by spraying it  with a garden hose through the night.  </P> <P> One of the largest structures lost was an 8,000-square-foot home at the top of  Hillside Drive.  </P> <P> Elsewhere, all that remained of one two-story house were four dozen  cinder-block columns that made up its frame, a chimney, the charred remains of  several cars and an indoor swimming pool, the water blackened by charred wood.  </P> <P> As residents surveyed their properties, they recounted a night of terror. Many  had stayed behind in Sleepy Hollow to protect their homes, and most were caught  by surprise when fire descended so rapidly on the community late Wednesday.  </P> <P> "It looked like a tidal wave of flame," said Sleepy Hollow resident Robin  Overholser, 36, whose home emerged unscathed.  </P> <P> Jim and Yvette Magliozzi, who stayed with their split-level ranch house, spent  five hours watering down their home and the homes of their neighbors. At one  point, a eucalyptus tree in their back yard burst into flames. The couple sent  their two children to stay with relatives.  </P> <P> The couple stayed up most of the night because of the smell of charred wood and  the fear that the fire would again come their way.  </P> <P> "The smoke was so bad you couldn't sleep. It just looked like a city with all  the embers going," said Yvette Magliozzi, 31, who on Thursday was helping her  husband care for pet dogs, cats and a goat that had been temporarily separated  from their owners during the fire.  </P> <P> Linda Wolverton, 40, a 15-year resident, remained with her home for all but  half an hour, when she went down to the road for some fresh air. Wolverton  praised firefighters for saving not only her home but the entire community.  </P> <P> "I just gave him (a firefighter) a big old hug," she said.  </P> <P> Himes, the owner of La Vida Hot Springs Cafe, was particularly appreciative of  a five-engine strike team dispatched from the Los Angeles County Fire  Department that saved his 64-year-old building.  </P> <P> "All I need is a couple of hoses and we can fight this s.o.b.," an exasperated  Himes had said earlier Wednesday evening as the glow of fire illuminated a  nearby ridgeline.  </P> <P> The firefighters took up defensive positions on the roof of the cafe and along  a creek bed. When fire ignited thick stands of bamboo congesting the creek bed,  Himes thought it was all over for his business. But the firefighters trained  their water hoses on the crackling flames and kept the fire back.  </P> <P> Janet Smith, a nearby canyon resident, looked on worriedly as the popular  landmark faced doom.  </P> <P> "This is a happy place," Smith said as oak trees popped and exploded under the  intense heat. "This is where people from all walks of life come."  </P> <P> In Sleepy Hollow, Brinay and his wife, Sue, who have lived in the area for 30  years, were more critical of the firefighters.  </P> <P> "The residents saved the houses," said Sue Brinay, 65.  </P> <P> The couple were upset because, they said, no firefighters were around when  flames reached their home.  </P> <P> "We are really upset," Sue Brinay said. "There was not one (firefighter)."  </P> <P> Capt. Dan Young of the Orange County Fire Department, however, said units were  there. Young said firefighters, faced with making split-second decisions, were  more likely to try to save those houses where brush had been cleared away in  compliance with the Fire Department's request -- the houses with "the most  likelihood of being saved."  </P> <P> "It's a tactical decision," he said.  </P> <P> So many homes were closely surrounded by trees and brush that fire officials  marveled that more damage was not done.  </P> <P> "It was designed for disaster," Capt. Bruce Brown of the California Department  of Forestry said at a Chino Hills command post late Wednesday night as embers  still flew through the sky, igniting new hot spots. "It could have been a bad,  bad situation."  </P> <P> But Casey Carter, 42, a Sleepy Hollow resident on Hillside Drive, said only so  much brush can be cleared away and only so much fire danger can be mitigated.  </P> <P> "Where do you clear it? All the way to the cement in Newport Beach?" Carter,  whose home was saved, asked as he watered down the parts of his lawn that were  still smoking. "You can't clear away 100-year oak trees."  </P> <P> Close proximity to the wilderness was also the downfall of residents whose  properties were lost in Riverside County's Bedford Canyon fire, which at one  point sent mile-high columns of smoke towering into the sky from the foothills  above Corona.  </P> <P> "The fire came up like a blowtorch," said Bob Moore Jr., whose parents' home  barely escaped serious damage in a canyon abutting the Cleveland National  Forest. "The heat was tremendous."  </P> <P> Fire officials estimated Thursday that 12 structures in the unincorporated El  Cerritos community were destroyed by the Bedford Canyon fire. Kim Bolan, a  California Department of Forestry spokesman monitoring the blaze, said the  structures included homes, barns and horse corrals.  </P> <P> Though largely confined to chaparral-covered wilderness, the blaze raced late  Wednesday toward Interstate 15, prompting the California Highway Patrol to shut  down the freeway for an hour as flames crossed over in places.  </P> <P> "I almost rear-ended somebody because smoke from the fire was so bad," said  Katie Seilsopour, a Riverside resident who was driving home from work in  Corona.  </P> <P> The Bedford Canyon fire began on June 19 when the U.S. Forest Service ignited  the "prescribed burn" under then-ideal (cool and humid) weather conditions,  said district forest ranger Suzanne L. Olson.  </P> <P> The fire jumped the control line Sunday afternoon, however, and by Wednesday  had flared into a raging inferno under 105-degree temperatures and high winds,  Olson said.  </P> <P> "We never expected it to get out of hand as it did," she said.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Robert E. Pierre contributed to this report.  </P> <P> </P> <P> CARBON CANYON FIRE  </P> <P> The Carbon Canyon fire burned 6,640 acres, destroyed or damaged 14 homes and  forced evacuation of hundreds of Chino Hills residents before being contained  at 4 p.m. Thursday. Most of the destruction occurred in and around Sleepy  Hollow, a hamlet of about 200 residents.  </P></p>

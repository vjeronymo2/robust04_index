			<p>Language: <F P=105>Korean </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] According to a broadcast report from Seoul, traitor  Kim Yong-sam ordered a grade-A emergency alert in Seoul and  Kyonggi Province from the morning of 23 March to the afternoon  of 24 March and ran amok with suppressive commotion. This is  aimed at banning the people's resistance against his traitorous  visit to Japan.    The puppet traitor also ordered police throughout South  Korea  to step up their alertness from 23 to 30 March [duration of ROK  President Kim Yong-sam's visits to both Japan and China].    Such a frenzy of suppression reveals an ugly face of one who  has a bad conscience due to his traitorous acts.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres by </F> Me'ir Einstein -- live]    [Excerpts] [Einstein] Mr. Peres, what issues in the Cairo  talks still remain open?    [Peres] We will see what issues are finalized by this  afternoon. There are still several issues that must be dealt  with.    [Einstein] Do you believe you will be able to reach  understandings during your visit to Cairo today?    [Peres] This is our intention, but it is impossible to know  what the other side's position will be: What they will  emphasize and what they will insist on. This is a negotiations  process, and in every such process we can know at most only 50  percent -- namely, our own positions.    [Einstein] What will we insist on?    [Peres] We will insist on what we have insisted on  throughout the process -- namely, the security issues. We will  not make any compromises on anything relating to human life. I  want to add here, however, something that everybody understands:  It is impossible to eradicate violence by force alone. Like  elsewhere in the world, we need a carrot in addition to the  stick. In order to wipe out the raging terrorism in Israel, we  must use both the carrot and the stick. [passage omitted]    [Einstein] It is generally assessed that the agreement will  be signed next week. Do you share this assessment?    [Peres] Unfortunately I cannot predict the date. I can tell  you with conviction, however, that we will do our utmost to  navigate the ship safely to shore -- namely, to finalize the  negotiations. If it takes one more week, that will be good; if  an additional week will be necessary, however, so be it.  Sometimes there is a trade-off [last word in English] between  the time element and the contents. There is no doubt, however,  that the issue has matured, and I believe we should sign the  agreement. When I spoke about the carrot, I was not referring  to mere tactics. I believe that only a new reality can change  the old reality -- that is, when the Palestinians finally have a  territorial address and possess various powers. The  Palestinians will have a piece of reality in their possession.  Without this, I fear that the overcrowded conditions, the  overpopulation, and mounting hate will feed the growing violence  and terrorism.    [Einstein] Mr. Peres, do you believe that an agreement with  the Palestinians will facilitate the talks with Syria?    [Peres] We have never made the two issues conditional on  each other. The truth is, however, that if we finalize the  agreement with the Palestinians, we will be freer to deal with  the Syrian issue, although we have never put this issue off.  Incidentally, wrapping things up with the Palestinians will be  no excuse for making uncalled for concessions on the Syrian  track. We want to attain a comprehensive agreement, and this  must clearly include Syria as well. We regard our future with  Syria not in terms of warfare but in terms of peace and  understanding in all spheres.    [Einstein] Does Christopher's visit mean a possible  breakthrough with Syria?    [Peres] The United States is constantly trying to lower the  expectations. It is right in doing so, because it, too, does  not know exactly what to expect from Damascus. I have no doubts  that Warren Christopher will exert supreme efforts to pave the  way for the negotiations. So far, however, Damascus is behaving  stubbornly. It appears to have a strategy of peace, but the  winds of peace are still not blowing from that direction.</p>

			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / TAP pay freeze accord disputed TAP-Air Portugal, the state airline, claimed yesterday to have agreed a pay freeze for the year with its cabin attendants, a statement challenged by the union which represents them. A spokesman for the airline said the union signed an agreement accepting whatever wage increases were determined for the whole company between 1994 and 1997. 'We have already made it clear there will be no increases for anyone in 1994 and the union has clearly accepted that,' he said. However, Mr Jose Braz, president of the union representing TAP's 1,300 flight attendants, said that the company was deliberately misinterpreting the agreement and that the union was still pressing for a 7 per cent wage increase. He said they had agreed maximum flying time would rise from 550 to 750 hours a year in return for a monthly expenses subsidy of Es25,000-Es75,000 (Pounds 96-Pounds 288), higher commission on in-flight sales and free flight insurance. TAP's 436 pilots have already accepted the increase in flying time although the issue of any pay rise is still unresolved. Negotiations with ground staff on pay and conditions have also yet to reach a conclusion. None of TAP's 9,500 workers received a pay rise last year and Mr Fernando Santos Martins, TAP president, has said the company cannot afford one this year. Like the company, the government has also interpreted the accord with the cabin attendants as an agreement to a wage freeze. It hailed the agreement as a breakthrough for its plans to return the debt-ridden company to profit by injecting Es180bn (Pounds 690m) in fresh capital and establishing labour peace. Mr Joaquim Ferreira do Amaral, transport minister, said it supported the government's recovery plan. However, Mr Braz said strikes were almost inevitable this year if a wage freeze was imposed. The airline's accumulated debt reached Es124.4bn in 1993 and operating losses rose to Es35bn, the worst result in the company's history. Portugal is seeking approval from the European Commission for a plan to bring the company back to profit in 1996 by injecting new capital and reducing the workforce by 2,400 people.</p>

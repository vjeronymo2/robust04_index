			<p>BFN     [Text] Justice Minister David Liba'i says he is at peace  with his proposal to appoint a national commission of inquiry  into the Hebron massacre. He says the commission has done a  thorough job and submitted a balanced report including wise and  practical recommendations. Minister Liba'i added that to the  best of his knowledge as a cabinet member, there was no  forewarning regarding the possibility of a massacre and it was  impossible to predict. He said the commission's findings  regarding this issue are of historic significance and he, for  one, supported the establishment of the commission. Mr. Liba'i  expects the government to fulfill all the recommendations of the  commission, which it itself appointed. He further recommends  that the police, the attorney general, and he himself increase  their involvement in law enforcement in the territories not only  when a disaster occurs but also on a routine basis. Minister  Liba'i was interviewed by our correspondent Mira Amsalem.    Ministers Sarid and Shahal say the government must embrace  the Shamgar Commission recommendations. Yosi Sarid says that  since it was determined that Goldstein acted alone, there was no  need for heads to roll. Minister Shahal said more funds must be  allocated to the police's newly established Judaea and Samaria  District.    The right wing of the political arena welcomes the Shamgar  recommendations and considers them a boost to the settlers'  status in the territories, whereas the left wing is disappointed  by the fact that the commission preferred to deal merely with  the massacre while ignoring the political, legal, and security  circumstances in the territories that made the massacre possible.    The leaders of the Israeli Arab sector expressed  disappointment with the Shamgar Commission conclusions. Our  correspondent Yo'el Dar reports that statements issued by Arab  Knesset members and mayors say that the recommendations do not  resolve the complicated situation in Hebron and that the  settlers must be removed from the city.    After the report's publication, HADASH [Democratic Front for  Peace and Equality] leaders convened in Haifa and stated that  the only conclusion to be drawn from the report is that all the  settlers must be evacuated first from Hebron and later from the  rest of the territories. The HADASH statement says that the  settlers are a time bomb threatening peace. HADASH believes the  main cause of the massacre -- namely, the causal connection  between the prolonged occupation and the massacre -- does not  appear in the report.</p>

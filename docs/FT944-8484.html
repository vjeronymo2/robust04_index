			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: BP restrained Oil major BP was restrained by news that the company had agreed to pay Dollars 1.4bn to settle a dispute over oil and gas production and income taxes allegedly owed to the state of Alaska. Analysts said that after the payment was offset against US Federal tax it would come down to around Dollars 900m which would be paid over three years. The Dollars 300m a year bill has been allowed for and BP said it would not affect earnings. However, it is likely to have an impact on gearing and US dealers were offering BP stock as soon as the news broke. In the UK, the shares dipped 1 1/2 to 425 1/2 p on turnover of 6.1m. Rival Shell Transport held steady at 707p ahead of a presentation to analysts and institutional investors in New York. The annual update is to be repeated in London on Monday. Pharmaceuticals group Glaxo slipped 2 1/2 to 612 1/2 p as the company said at its annual meeting sales growth was weak and also disappointed those who though it might spend some of its Pounds 2.2bn cash pile on shareholders. The company said that the declining growth was a reflection of a weaker dollar but there was some concern that it might have had a more fundamental base. There had also been some speculation - fuelled by a news-wire report yesterday - that Glaxo might either announce a share buy-back or special dividend payment. However Sir Paul Girolami, the outgoing chairman, said there were no plans for a buy-back which could cause problems with advanced corporation tax. Wellcome gained 3 to 663p ahead of a big conference on Aids in Glasgow. The company has an Aids treatment known as Retrovir which has come in for serious criticism. Redland gained 8 to 487p in modest 1.4m turnover for a two-day improvement of 12 as attention focused on the building materials group's high foreign currency earnings. With turnover inflated to 11m by a number of bed and breakfast, tax related deals, housebuilder Beazer gained a penny to 136p. A NatWest Securities recommendation earlier this week pushed United Biscuits up 11 to 329p, in good trade of 3.2m. Fans of Associated British Foods celebrated this week's EU decision to make no change to production quotas for sugar. Its British Sugar subsidiary has around 50 per cent of the UK sugar market and there had been fears of a less favourable quota regime. The stock jumped 17 to 574p. Recent bid speculation in Hazlewood Foods appeared to fade leaving the shares 4 lighter at 120p. Sellers were also in evidence at Unigate which reported good figures earlier this week. The shares eased 5 to 357p. In the drinks sector, Greenalls advanced 15 to 433p, after Hoare Govett reiterated its buy recommendation. The broker cited the improved terms of the company's supply agreement with Whitbread among the reasons for its positive stance. Whitbread, which reported interims on Thursday ended the session unchanged at 551p. Mobile communications group Vodafone, which earlier this week was within 6 1/2 of its 207 1/2 p high for the year, shed a further 6 to 208p in 3.6m turnover as bullish stories about next Tuesday's interim results showed signs of turning sour. Robert Fleming Securities issued a sell note. Press reports that the four biggest Austrian banks were preparing to provide against Eurotunnel debt in their 1994 accounts left the channel tunnel operator 4 lower at 259p. Media conglomerate Pearson shed 8 to 608p as NatWest Securities held presentations to discuss a bearish thesis on the valuation of BSkyB, the satellite group which is to be floated and in which Pearson has a significant stake. Publisher Emap eased 4 to 400p ahead of interim figures on Monday.</p>

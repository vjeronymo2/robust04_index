			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / Arts: Richard Eyre to leave the Royal National Theatre The director of the Royal National Theatre, Richard Eyre, is to leave his post. Eyre, who took on the job in 1988, is planning to go freelance. His decision is not entirely unexpected: when his first five year term expired in 1993 he signed up again for three years only. He is actually adding another few months to his contract before departing in 1997. After such a long period immersed in the task of running a large company with a turnover approaching Pounds 30m a year, Eyre will be broadening his horizons. Last month his first opera production, La traviata, opened at Covent Garden. Taking over at the National from Sir Peter Hall, Eyre quickly made his mark. He was responsible for adding successful musicals, most notably his own production of Guys and Dolls and Nicholas Hytner's production of Carousel to the repertoire: both went on to commercial success in the West End. He has also invited outside companies to take over the stage, including small but innovative troupes like Complicite and Cheek by Jowl. He has had a run of artistic and commercial successes, like Alan Bennett's The Madness of George III and Wind in the Willows, the David Hare Trilogy, and most recently An Inspector Calls. During most of his stewardship the National Theatre has enjoyed box office success and critical acclaim. In the last year Eyre's touch has faltered slightly with a string of American plays, some of which (notably Johnny on a the Spot, which he directed himself) were poorly received. But any small deficit in 1994-95 will be more than absorbed by the accumulated reserves, and with an attractive programme for next year to be announced today, including Euripides' The Trojan Women, his successor should inherit a sound craft. Eyre is also making good in 1995 one of the gaps in his programming, a paucity of plays by new playwrights, with first works from comedy writer Patrick Marber and from Paul Godfrey. Just who will take over will be a matter for speculation for some time. But among the favourites must be Stephen Daldry, who has progressed through a small theatre, the Gate, to run the medium-sized Royal Court. He might welcome the ultimate challenge and has good links with the National - he directed An Inspector Calls. An even younger contender could be Sam Mendes who on Thursday sees the opening of his first big musical, Oliver, the royalties from which would enable him to survive on the director of the National's salary of Pounds 80,000 plus, a miserly sum compared with the rewards of regular freelance work. Another possible candidate, Nicholas Hytner, might find the job restricting after enjoying the variety of directing operas and films as well as plays. And there is always Sir Ian McKellen, already an associate director at the National, as are outsiders Deborah Warner and Declan Donnellan. Whoever takes on the job will find Eyre a hard act to follow. He has enjoyed a popularity almost unique in his profession and has totally devoted himself to the National. He has built and consolidated the theatre's reputation as one of the most firmly established, highly respected and artistically flourishing arts companies in the country.</p>

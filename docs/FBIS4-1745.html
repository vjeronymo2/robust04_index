			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Special article" by reporter He Chong (6320 3095): "UK </F> Business Community Eager To See Improved PRC Ties"]    [Text] Hong Kong, 17 February (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--  According to reports published by London newspapers, UK  industrial and commercial circles have recently and repeatedly  warned John Major's government that Hong Kong Governor Chris  Patten's hostile stance and behavior toward China on the  question of Hong Kong's political reform is bound to adversely  affect Sino-British relations and jeopardize Sino-British  economic and trade cooperation. Some personages within  Britain's industrial, commercial, and political circles have  even publicly demanded that the "Hong Kong governor be replaced"  and maintain that only by doing so will Britain's and Hong  Kong's long-term interests be safeguarded.    On 7 February, given deteriorating Anglo-Chinese relations,  the "Anglo-Chinese Trade Group 48" announced its decision to  cancel a scheduled visit to China by a heavyweight British trade  delegation led by British Trade and Industry Secretary Michael  Heseltine this coming fall in a bid to avoid embarrassment. It  was reported that the "Anglo-Chinese Trade Group 48" had  originally decided to send a total of 24 economic and trade  delegations to China this year with the aforementioned  high-level delegation comprising the chief executives of some  100 major British firms being the most important. The delegation  was originally scheduled to visit China in late September of  this year to promote the sale of UK-made technology and  equipment to China and was scheduled to visit Beijing, Shanghai,  the Three Gorges of the Chang Jiang, Tianjin, Wuhan, Guangzhou,  and Shenzhen, as well as some other places in China. As Hong  Kong Governor Chris Patten has submitted the first part and  plans to submit the second and last part of his political reform  package to the Legislative Council in early March [as received]  and have them ratified for official enforcement this coming  July, the Chinese side is expected to react strongly to the  governor's decision. Thus, it would be inappropriate for  British business leaders to visit China under such an  "atmosphere."    Not long before, Bailiren [4101 4409 0088], president of the  "Anglo-Chinese Trade Group 48," had publicly accused John  Major's government of ignoring the views and jeopardizing the  interests of the UK business community, saying that the way in  which the government had handled the Hong Kong question had  undermined Anglo- Chinese trade relations, that the government  had failed to see the adverse effects of Chris Patten's  political reform package, and that it is not worthwhile for the  government to risk everything on Chris Patten's political reform  package. He also made it clear that the UK business community  would not give its support to Chris Patten, stating: "We want  to see him removed from office; the sooner, the better."    In the meantime, many of Britain's industrial associations  and chambers of commerce have also started demanding that John  Major's government take measures to remove the obstacles  hampering Anglo- Chinese relations and to explore ways to enter  the China market. At an annual meeting of the Birmingham  Chamber of Commerce held on 28 January, 1994, Mr. Carter,  chairman of the Birmingham Chamber of Commerce, told British  Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd, one of his distinguished guests  at the occasion, that diplomats should make redoubled efforts to  promote foreign trade and support businessmen in expanding  exports to China. As the British Government's position on the  question of Hong Kong has already undermined Anglo-Chinese  relations, he added, some of the Anglo-Chinese economic  cooperation projects previously agreed upon by the two sides  were now in danger of being frozen or scrapped. Moreover, he  said, the UK business community will inevitably lose business  opportunities in China. Mr. Carter stressed that China is now  the biggest market in the world. [sentence as received] It  would be terribly wrong for Britain to shoot itself in the foot  and undercut its own competitiveness at this moment. Therefore,  he noted, the British Government should reexamine its policies.    At a large exhibition, entitled "Hong Kong's Achievements,"  which was held two months ago, John Major was asked by more than  300 influential businessmen from all over the world how he  would, in his capacity as prime minister, try to protect the  interests of the British business community in Hong Kong and  China, as well as in Asia as a whole.    What merits attention is that China has repeatedly expressed  welcome to British businessmen and has invited them to invest in  and discuss trade. In fact, the total volume of Sino-British  trade reached $3.59 billion in 1993, up 86 percent over the  previous year, only slightly lower than the increases registered  in Sino-German trade and in the volume of trade between China  and some West European countries. Nonetheless, since Britain  has adopted an unfriendly and noncooperative attitude toward  China on the question of Hong Kong, Sino-British economic and  trade relations are bound to be adversely affected in the long  run. Beijing officials have already stated that the Chinese  side is unwilling to see this and should not be held responsible  for such a scenario.    UK officials and the business community concede that China  has thus far shown no signs of discriminating against the UK  business community. However, any country or region will try to  select firms from a friendly country as its business partners so  long as it can offer prices which are not higher and possesses  technology which is not inferior to those offered by firms from  other countries in the bidding process. Some UK newspapers,  including "THE OBSERVER," "THE DAILY TELEGRAPH," and "THE SUN,"  have published commentaries, saying that Britain has  underestimated the indignation of China's local governments on  the question of Hong Kong, and the majority of China's imports,  worth about $700 billion in all, will be purchased by local  governments over the next seven years. Should Britain try to  encroach upon Chinese sovereignty and violate agreements reached  with China in the past on the question of Hong Kong, they asked,  how could Britain expect the Chinese to be friendly to it? They  argued that as Germany has entered the China market and France  has stopped arms sales to Taiwan in an attempt to restore  friendly relations with China and increase exports to China,  there is no reason for Britain not to do the same.</p>

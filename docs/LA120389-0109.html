			<p><P> December 3, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LONG BEACH SHAKES OFF EARLY JITTERS AND STEALS IT FROM PURDUE, 70-69  </P> <P> In their first big game, Cal State Long Beach's new players looked nervous most  of the way Saturday. But in the end, they played like veterans and stole a  70-69 victory from Purdue before 3,655 fans at the Long Beach Arena.  </P> <P> With 10 seconds to play and the 49ers trailing, 69-68, freshman Lucious Harris  stole the ball near midcourt and drove for a layup. He missed, but Kenny  Jarvis, another new 49er, tipped the ball in with two seconds left.  </P> <P> "We should have been there to get the ball," Purdue Coach Gene Keady said.  "They outhustled us."  </P> <P> After a timeout, the Boilermakers threw a length-of-the-court pass, but  couldn't get off a shot.  </P> <P> Harris had hit an 18-foot jump shot with 32 seconds remaining to tie the game,  68-68. With 15 seconds left, Long Beach fouled Chuckie White immediately after  he had caught an inbounds pass. White made the front end of the one-and-one,  then missed the second shot. Purdue, though, got the ball back when Jarvis  couldn't hang onto the rebound.  </P> <P> But Harris knocked the ball away from Rich Mount -- a freshman and son of Rick  Mount, Purdue's all-time leading scorer -- and the 49ers soon had their first  victory over a Big Ten team in 15 years. They lost to Purdue last season by 47  points.  </P> <P> "It made a statement for our program," said Long Beach Coach Joe Harrington,  although he didn't think that his team (2-0) played that well.  </P> <P> And for much of the first half, the 49ers' tightness was as conspicuous as  their new lime, glow-in-the-dark, "California gold" uniforms. At one point,  Long Beach, which shot only 39% in the first half, was behind, 12-3.  </P> <P> "We played like we were afraid we were going to miss," Harrington said. "Our  defense enabled us to stay in the game, especially our pressure."  </P> <P> Long Beach made 19 turnovers but forced the Boilermakers (2-1) into 22.  </P> <P> Forward Kevin Cutler was one 49er newcomer who didn't appear bothered by  playing for the first time in the 12,000-seat arena against a big-name team. A  6-9 junior from Arizona Western College, he made eight of 14 field goal  attempts and led all scorers with 23 points.  </P> <P> Steve Scheffler and Tony Jones led Purdue with 16 points apiece.  </P></p>

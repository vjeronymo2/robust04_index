			<p><P> March 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: DANCE  </P> <P> Benefit in Debt: The independent committee that organized last Sunday's opera  and ballet gala in Pasadena to benefit the AIDS Hospice Foundation is $100,000  in debt, said George Schleder, director of the From the Heart Committee.  </P> <P> No major corporate sponsor was found and only 900 of about 3,000 tickets were  sold. Organizers had to scale back the gala, and some of the performers  originally scheduled to appear were forced to drop out of the program. Schleder  hopes to erase the debt and contribute $250,000 to the AIDS Hospice Foundation  by selling limited edition $1,200 lithographs of the event's logo. CLAUDIA PUIG  </P></p>

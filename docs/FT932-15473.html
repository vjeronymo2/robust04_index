			<p>930413 FT  13 APR 93 / Nato starts policing no-fly zone as Serb barrage kills over 50 NATO FIGHTER aircraft began policing the skies over Bosnia-Hercegovina yesterday as fighting intensified on the ground with more than 50 killed in a Serb artillery barrage on the Moslem town of Srebrenica. A French Mirage jet crashed in the Adriatic because of engine failure soon after the Nato alliance embarked on its first combat missions since it was formed in 1949. The pilot ejected and was rescued from the sea. French, US and Dutch aircraft are being deployed to enforce the no-fly zone imposed by the United Nations over Bosnia in a move aimed at putting more pressure on the Serbs to accept a peace settlement. The fighters will be supported by Nato early warning aircraft carrying multinational crews, including Germans on their first combat mission since the second world war. But western diplomats held out little hope that shooting down any violators of the ban on flights would end the bloodshed in Bosnia. General Manojlo Milovanovic, deputy commander of the Bosnian Serb army, said his forces would not open fire or provoke incidents but would carry on normal operations. 'The Serbs will carry on with their business as usual. They will defend their territories, and liberate more, and if Nato has oil to spare then it can chase its own tail in the Bosnia-Hercegovina sky,' he said. As the Nato aircraft began their patrols, fighting on the ground broke out in spite of a UN-negotiated ceasefire. In Srebrenica, where thousands of Moslems have been besieged by Serb forces, 56 people were reported killed and 73 seriously injured in a Serb artillery attack. Serb forces besieging Sarajevo shelled the city as military leaders of the mainly Moslem Bosnian forces boycotted UN-mediated talks at Sarajevo airport. General Sefer Halilovic, commander of the Bosnian army, said he would refuse to meet General Ratko Mladic, Bosnian Serb commander, until Serb forces halted attacks on Srebrenica and a ceasefire was in effect for 24 hours in eastern Bosnia. General Lars-Erik Wahlgren, the commander of UN forces in former Yugoslavia, held talks with Gen Mladic to press for a ceasefire and for Serb forces to stop blocking the deployment of 150 Canadian peacekeepers in Srebrenica. In New York, UN officials confirmed it was unlikely that the Security Council would decide on a tough new package of sanctions against Serbia. The officials said the decision to put off a vote on sanctions for up to two weeks was to accommodate Russian president Boris Yeltsin, who faces a crucial referendum on April 25. The Russian leader is anxious to avoid opposition charges that he is selling out the Serbs, Moscow's traditional allies.</p>

In effect, Pyongyang agreed on  Tuesday 15 February -- barely a week before the expiration of  the ultimatum issued by the International Atomic Energy Agency  (IAEA) -- to resume international inspections of its officially  listed nuclear installations.    Inspectors will therefore once again be visiting the seven  sites which they have been unable to visit for more than a year  because of opposition from Pyongyang. Washington, Seoul, and  Tokyo were immediately pleased with this new attitude and talks  between the United States and North Korea resumed within hours.  Nevertheless, both Japan and the IAEA hastened to point out  that this agreement still did not cover the two sites which the  Kim Il-song regime is accused of using to try and develop the  atomic bomb. Both the CIA and certain well-informed Russian  circles are convinced that Pyongyang already has several nuclear  warheads.    North Korea's past attitude calls for caution. This is not  the first time that it has laid down the law or reneged on its  commitments. Just last week, it was still threatening to  respond to international sanctions, whereas it is undoubtedly  this very threat which led it to compromise. In any case, its  maneuvering will have gained it a year that could be turned to  profit by its atomic scientists.    Under these circumstances, it is important that we not  deceive ourselves too much. Pyongyang's gesture cannot be  considered a success for President Clinton, whose hesitant  attitude contributed not inconsiderably to prolonging the  crisis, and who has shown his inability to force a state that  was openly violating the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT)  to yield.    On the contrary, North Korea can feel that it was correct to  force a crisis, and rightly so: In order to force the country  to return to a "status quo ante," the Americans had to agree to  initiate a political dialogue with Pyongyang and even to promise  it possible diplomatic recognition and aid which its totally  collapsed economy most urgently needs. And yet, the two  contested sites have still not been opened up.    Even worse, the White House had to put up with the combined  pressure of the North Koreans and their neighbors, who are  worried about the risk of aggravating tension in the region. In  the Korean peninsula -- the final frontier of the Cold War --  like elsewhere in the world, be it yesterday in Iraq or today in  Bosnia, only a decisive and united attitude by the international  community will prove effective in maintaining peace. Gaining  time or yielding to pressure without a coherent strategy has its  price sooner or later.</p>

			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Roger Shute buys 4.4% of GM Firth MR ROGER Shute, whose illness-related departure from BM Group sparked the collapse of its share price last summer, has bought a 4.4 per cent stake in GM Firth, the steel company. The news prompted a sharp rise in Firth's share price from 10p to 14 1/2 p yesterday. Mr Shute, who has spent several months recuperating from smoking and stress-related lung disease, said: 'It's an interesting little company'. He thought Mr Michael Wilkinson, the chairman and chief executive, was a man to follow, although the two had never met. Mr Wilkinson said that Mr Shute would without any doubt be a candidate for a non-executive directorship. The interim results and news about the heavily-indebted company's future should be announced in the next two weeks. In November 1991 Mr Wilkinson bought a 21 per cent stake in Firth from the then chairman Mr Ian Wasserman, a former aide to Mr Jim Slater. Mr Wilkinson's brother Howard also joined the board. Neither brother has taken a salary from Firth and a personal loan of Pounds 350,000 has been made to the company. After last autumn's sale of a 23 per cent stake in Arthur Lee for about Pounds 5.4m, borrowings were cut to less than Pounds 9m and a banking agreement extended. Firth lost Pounds 4.86m in 1991-92 and recently emerged from a five-month strike over manning and working practices. Mr Shute's only contact with the company so far has been to notify it of his stake. He has spent about Pounds 130,000 on 1.45m shares. He said that although he was not contemplating returning to 18-hour days, he would like to take on two or three non-executive directorships. He remains president of BM, the industrial holding company which turned over Pounds 519m last year.</p>

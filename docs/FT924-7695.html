			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / Markets: Income dilemma for savers - Serious Money ANOTHER UK base rate cut, another problem for those who depend on their savings for income. This dilemma for savers is a deliberate part of government strategy. It hopes to reach the point where the return on savings has fallen so far that the public decides it might as well spend the money instead. If that happens, the economy will start to grow again. But this theory does not apply to elderly investors for whom cuts in rates represent a fall in their standard of living, especially if they have kept most of their savings in the bank or building society. Abbey National has indicated that it will cut gross savings rates by 1 per cent, which means that if you have Pounds 10,000 to Pounds 25,000 in its 90 day account, you are likely to receive 6.15 per cent gross, or just 4.61 per cent net per annum. In December 1991, the rate was 10.2 per cent gross or 7.65 per cent net. For savers, that represents a 40 per cent fall in income in one year. And as rates fall, the options for investors become more difficult. This was illustrated once more by the falls in National Savings returns which were announced on Thursday. The old 39th issue of certificates, which paid 6.75 per cent tax-free of held for five years, will be replaced on December 7 by the 40th issue, paying 5.75 per cent. Series F Capital Bonds, paying a taxable 9 per cent if held for five years, will be replaced by Series G, paying 7.75 per cent, on the same date. Rates have now fallen to the point where savers must question the wisdom of locking in such returns for five years. In the short term, rates may well fall further, with experts looking to base rates of 6 per cent and even less. Bitter experience, however, has taught Britons that interest rates can move up very quickly once the economy recovers and the government starts to worry about inflation and the balance of payments deficit. A one year fixed rate offer might thus be all the more attractive, so it was disappointing that the government has withdrawn the First Option Bond from sale 'for the time being'. The building society lobby seems to have won its battle and eliminated a keen competitor from the fray. There was further bad news. The Weekend FT has been plugging the 5th issue of index-linked National Savings for a long time now and it is hoped that readers have stocked up on the issue, which paid 4.5 per cent above inflation, tax-free. If you did not buy the issue, it is too late. The 6th issue will pay just 3.25 per cent above inflation. Why 3.25 per cent? The rate seems to have been chosen with reference to the government's target range for inflation of 1 per cent to 4 per cent. The middle of that range is 2.5 per cent - adding on 3.25 per cent takes you to 5.75 per cent, the rate for the new fixed issue of certificates. If you believe that inflation is going to be higher than 2.5 per cent, the index-linked certificates offer a better deal than the fixed - and may well turn out to have been a good purchase in five years time. But you can now buy just Pounds 5,000, compared with the old maximum of Pounds 10,000. To round off the cuts, the dreaded general extension rate, which applies to certificates past their maturity date, has been lowered to 3.75 per cent per annum. And the return on the premium bond fund has been lowered from 6.5 per cent to 5 per cent per annum. So where else can the private investor turn? Long gilts now yield just over 8.5 per cent gross to redemption. Private investors have been moving heavily into gilts, so much so that it has caused liquidity problems (see Page IV). There are dangers here. With a budget deficit of Pounds 37bn this year and Pounds 44bn next, the government will have to issue lots of gilts. Demand could be swamped and prices fall (and many gilts are trading above face value). Inflation, the great enemy of gilts investors, may rise again. Nevertheless, with inflation currently at 3.6 per cent, long gilts are offering a real yield of around 5 per cent. It must make sense for investors to have a proportion of their portfolios in this area. The really big decision for investors is whether they risk going into shares. The All-Share Index is now yielding a gross 4.6 per cent, equivalent to the net return on a lot of building society accounts. As you can get income from equities tax-free via a Pep, the net returns are probably not too dissimilar for basic rate taxpayers and for the top rate taxpayer the balance may well be in favour of equities (much depends on the charges). Lewis Aaron, investment trust analyst at Warburg Securities, favours two good income trusts - Securities Trust of Scotland, yielding 6.1 per cent and TR City of London, yielding 5.4 per cent. The former is available in a Pep, with an initial fee of Pounds 50 and an annual charge of Pounds 60. The latter has a 1 per cent transaction charge and 1 per cent annual charge. Aaron also points to the world of split capital trusts, citing River &amp; Mercantile income shares, where a yield of 11.15 per cent is on offer even assuming no growth in revenues between now and the trust's wind-up date in the year 2000. And he says that well covered zeroes (which pay no income, but offer return in the form of tax-free capital gain) are yielding around 7.5 per cent to redemption. Advice from a good stockbroker is vital in this field, as is a commitment to long term investment - five years at least. Dividend cuts are a real possibility at some trusts and the stock market could easily fall in the short term. But the longer term arguments for having part of your portfolio in shares are harder to resist.</p>

The sides agreed that relations between our  countries have not reached the desired level and our countries  have not made complete use of their potential. These relations  can be improved and expanded, something that can be achieved  through the meeting of the two prime ministers, that is the  prime minister of Romania and of Russia, that will take place in  the near future.    With Romania's president I held only a political dialogue,  Pavel Grachev said, noting that he informed the Romanian  president about the internal political situation in Russia, the  division of political forces, and the actions taken by the  president and the government to find solutions to the internal  and foreign policy problems and to the problems of reform.    President Iliescu informed the guest about the domestic and  foreign activity of the political leadership in Romania. The  sides reached the conclusion that our countries have many  similar ways to ensure their development.    Iliescu declared that Romania wishes to achieve a closer  cooperation with Russia and is expecting a meeting with Boris  Yeltsin, a meeting that he hopes will take place still this  year. Russia's position is identical, namely to strengthen ties  with Romania, which diminished at a certain point.    Grachev declared that he held talks with President Ion  Iliescu on several foreign policy issues, especially about the  Partnership for Peace with the countries of Western Europe and  with the United States.    The sides reached the conclusion that the partnership should  be based on the principle of equality, there should be a basis  for mutual advantage, and all countries in Europe should be  drawn into this partnership to ensure joint security.</p>

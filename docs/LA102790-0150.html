			<p><P> October 27, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 3 BALLOT INITIATIVES SEEN ADDING TO FISCAL PROBLEMS;  </P> <P> FINANCE: EXPERTS SAY APPROVAL OF PROPOSITIONS 128, 129 AND 134 WOULD INCREASE  STATE COSTS $460 MILLION THE FIRST YEAR, $900 MILLION THE NEXT.  </P> <P> The state budget, already heading toward a sea of red ink, would take on an  additional $460 million in costs if three initiatives dealing with the  environment, law enforcement and the alcohol tax are approved by voters, a  legislative budget committee learned Friday.  </P> <P> Finance Director Jesse R. Huff, in a briefing to the Joint Legislative Budget  Committee, said the new costs would come from spending requirements contained  in Proposition 128, the so-called "Big Green" initiative; Proposition 129, a  drug enforcement and prison bond measure; and Proposition 134, the  "nickel-a-drink" alcohol tax proposal.  </P> <P> Huff said the cost of the three initiatives would nearly double next year,  soaring to $900 million.  </P> <P> Although the propositions include increases in taxes or fees to pay for  mandated programs, the new revenues will not cover all the costs, Huff and  other experts said.  </P> <P> Various tax increase proposals contained in Proposition 129 have already been  enacted by the Legislature and the money is being used to finance non-law  enforcement programs. So support of the programs called for by the law  enforcement measure would have to come from general purpose tax revenues.  </P> <P> In the case of Proposition 134, the tax increase on alcoholic beverages would  generate at least $500 million a year in new revenues. But that money is  earmarked for special programs and cannot be used to support general state  programs. At the same time, the measure mandates minimum levels of state  financial support for a wide variety of health and welfare programs, so money  for those programs would have to come out of general purpose tax revenues.  </P> <P> Huff complained that initiative sponsors did not focus "on the big picture," or  the state budget as a whole. "No one has bothered, in thinking of these  initiatives and drafting them, how that fits into the context of our budget  situation," Huff said.  </P> <P> Legislative Analyst Elizabeth G. Hill, while falling generally in line with  Huff's estimates on the cost of the three propositions, told the committee that  annual interest and principal payments on the 14 bond measures on the ballot  would be more than $450 million if all are approved.  </P> <P> The money to pay the additional costs during the current year would come from  the budget reserve -- and in future years from general tax revenues used to  finance school, human services and law enforcement programs.  </P> <P> Gov. George Deukmejian's budget for the 1990-91 fiscal year, which began last  July 1, anticipated a $1.3-billion reserve.  </P> <P> But in reality the reserve may only be half that and seems to be shrinking  almost weekly. Tax collections on which the governor based his reserve figure  were already $138 million less than expected after only three months into the  fiscal year. And the governor's budget counted on the state ending the last  fiscal year with $700 million left in the reserve. A preliminary accounting by  Controller Gray Davis indicated that the balance was closer to zero.  </P> <P> Hill told the committee that the budget problem was not going to get easier  soon.  </P> <P> She said current expectations are that next year's budget will be at least $1.1  billion short of what will be needed to cover state services. Hill said: "We  think these estimates are very conservative. (The gap) could very well grow."  She said the $1.1-billion estimate did not take into account the effects of the  crisis in the Persian Gulf, the weakening of the national economy since August  or ballot measures that may pass in the Nov. 6 election.  </P> <P> Hill also told lawmakers that the various budget problems and a change in the  California Constitution approved by voters in June have left the state roughly  $2.7 billion below the state spending limit. As legislators were quick to note,  that means the Legislature could raise taxes by that amount.  </P> <P> "So, if the chairman wanted to raise taxes, he could, I guess," said Sen.  Robert G. Beverly (R-Manhattan Beach).  </P> <P> "The chairman" he referred to is Sen. Alfred E. Alquist (D-San Jose), head of  the budget committee. Alquist each year carries a major tax bill, but in recent  years he has been stymied both by the political climate in the Legislature as  well as the spending limit.  </P></p>

			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / Survey of Venture and Development Capital (13): Rich angels to the rescue British business angels have long been assumed to be poor cousins of the richer, more entrepreneurial and better-served American variety, but a new report challenges this assumption. Patrick Coveney, a PhD student at Oxford collected data from about 500 angels or would-be angels, in a survey conducted with the help of Venture Capital Report, a business angel agency which publishes a monthly report on projects seeking finance. Angels in the sample were all users of or people who had expressed interest in using introduction agencies. The researchers concluded that British angels were richer, invested more and were more like their American counterparts than previously depicted. The survey found that while in some ways the angels did fit the long-standing stereotype - they were overwhelmingly male, middle-aged, university educated and had run their own businesses - their characteristics and investment behaviour differed quite considerably from the image given by earlier research on the subject. More than half had a net worth of more than Pounds 500,000, and 30 per cent were worth more than Pounds 1m - but two earlier surveys had found that only a third or fewer had assets of more than Pounds 500,000. Three-quarters of the participants in the new survey had a income of more than Pounds 100,000 a year. The average angel had made 2.34 investments totalling Pounds 266,000 in the past three years, with an average single investment of Pounds 140,000, and a median of Pounds 40,000. This compares with the average investment of Pounds 10,000 given by an earlier survey. Previous surveys strongly indicated that location was one of the most important factors in angels' choice of investment - very few were thought willing to invest in companies more than 100 miles away. Coveney's survey, in contrast, found that only 5 per cent of angels cited location as the most vital criterion, while 58 per cent did not think it was very important. Almost half would invest in businesses more than 200 miles away. The most important factor in angels' decision on whether or not to invest was their impression of the founder or management: 59 per cent said this was the principal criterion. Next most important was their own understanding of the sector, with such areas as the content and presentation of business plans and projected profitability ranking much lower. Respondents' main motivation for choosing angel-style investment was to get a better return on their money than they could from the stock market - they expected a return of at least 21 per cent a year. About a third were interested in generating a job or an income for themselves, and a third were also motivated by the fun and satisfaction of being an angel. Investors said that the main barrier to greater activity was a lack of suitable business proposals, rather than a lack of money to invest: 70 per cent of them would have liked to make more investments if they had found suitable opportunities. A high proportion said they had more than Pounds 100,000 of funds still available to invest, and 76 per cent expected to increase their investments over the next five years. So there may be hundreds of potential angels waiting for the right opportunity to come up, but are there as many businesses interested in dealing with angels? The Enterprise Support Group commissioned a Mori survey of of small and medium businesses earlier this year, to coincide with the launch of VentureList, its national computer database of investors and business propositions. The survey found that only 8 per cent of small and medium sized businesses had seriously considered using angels as a source of finance, even though many were worried about the level of debt in their businesses. However, 40 per cent would consider raising finance from an individual investor if there was an easy way of finding an angel willing to invest on agreed terms.</p>

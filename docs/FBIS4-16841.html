			<p>BFN     [Text] Chairman of the State Duma Committee for  international affairs Vladimir Lukin considers "improbable" that  the lower chamber of parliament will hold a closed meeting to  discuss the situation in former Yugoslavia Wednesday, April 20.  Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin earlier  reported to Interfax about the possibility of holding such a  meeting after meeting with speaker of the State Duma Ivan Rybkin.    According to Lukin, the Council of the State Duma on Tuesday  decided to put on the agenda of the plenary meeting on Wednesday  only the issue of sending a parliamentary delegation to the  republics of former Yugoslavia. He pointed out that the  delegation will include representatives of all factions and  intends to get acquainted with the positions of all sides in the  conflict.</p>

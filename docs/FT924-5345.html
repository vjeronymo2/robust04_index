			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / Taxing the Monarchy: Audit confounded by ritual secrecy THE QUEEN'S personal fortune and the income that will be subject to tax are impossible to estimate accurately because so much secrecy has traditionally surrounded her accounts. This is unlikely to change even when she starts paying tax. Her personal fortune could be as little as Pounds 50m or as much as Pounds 6.5bn, according to estimates published in unofficial surveys. The huge disparity is caused by the lack of information and by whether the value of palaces and paintings, technically owned by the monarch, are included. The Queen has three primary strands of income: Income from her personal wealth, which reliable sources say could be around Pounds 50m. It is already clear that this will be liable to income tax at up to 40 per cent, and capital gains tax. The civil list settlement presented to parliament in 1990 which ensures an income of Pounds 79m between 1990 and 2000, rising by 7.5 per cent a year to take care of inflation. The Queen's share of the civil list payments is about Pounds 7.9m. This is not taxed at present, and will not be under the new regime, as it is regarded as money to cover the Queen's function as head of state. The most complex area of the privy purse which includes a mix of public and private functions, and part of which will probably be taxed. The dividing lines are still to be devised by the Queen's advisers and the Inland Revenue. The proposed changes will also mean that the only members of the royal family funded directly by the taxpayer will be the Queen, the Duke of Edinburgh and the Queen Mother. Others will still receive money from the civil list because they perform public duties, but much more money will be repaid by the Queen in future. It is estimated that the Queen at present reimburses the Exchequer by about Pounds 650,000 a year for minor members of the royal family, and this will rise by a further Pounds 800,000. This money comes from income and rents from the Duchy of Lancaster estates owned by the Queen. The new arrangements, which should be completed in the new year ready to be introduced at the start of the next tax year in April, follow growing unease that the monarch pays no personal taxes. Increasing public clamour over the royal family's financial arrangements has come to a head following a succession of royal scandals and the disclosure this week that the taxpayer is to foot the bill for the fire damage at Windsor Castle, which could reach Pounds 60m. The pivotal question now will be how much the public will be allowed to know about the Queen's private income from her shares and property. She would presumably be entitled, like any individual, to a personal allowance of Pounds 3,445. After that, the first Pounds 2,000 of her income would be taxed at 20 per cent, and the next Pounds 21,700 at 25 per cent. Everything else would be taxable at the top rate of 40 per cent. Dividend payments are normally taxed (at basic rate) at source and the Queen has presumably been reclaiming the tax credit to date. It accordingly would be quite easy to collect the tax on her investment income once her immunity ended. Although some estimates have put the Queen's private wealth at as much as Pounds 6.5bn, Philip Hall in his book Royal Fortune: Tax, Money and the Monarchy estimates a more conservative figure for investments of Pounds 341m, and annual income of Pounds 18.4m. On that basis, her tax bill would be just under Pounds 7.35m a year. Then there is the Queen's rental income from her estates. She would be allowed to offset costs against this income but according to Richard Law of accountants Ernst &amp; Young, these costs might be small since the Queen would not have borrowing costs on the properties. But there is a further issue. An ordinary employee would face a tax liability on those perks provided to the Queen, such as rent-free accommodation and a company car. Presumably the Queen will still be exempt from tax on these. Capital gains tax is payable, at the individual's highest tax rate, on realised gains of over Pounds 5,800 in the current tax year. Investors are allowed compensation for the effects of inflation on asset prices since 1982. Should the Queen dispose of any of her art collection, that would also attract CGT. A CGT liability can be triggered by other events, such as destruction, which might lead to a tax problem if the Windsor fire were to recur. Inheritance tax is payable at a rate of 40 per cent on estates worth more than Pounds 150,000. There are many vehicles for getting round the tax, however, such as the use of trusts. Palace officials have previously justified the fact that the Queen has paid no taxes on the grounds of tradition. According to Buckingham Palace, 'taxes are levied in the Queen's name and therefore it would not be appropriate for the Queen to pay taxes.' The palace also argues that any cost-to-taxpayer assessment had to include the benefits brought by tourism and the 'prestige, access and reputation' that the UK had acquired internationally thanks partly to the presence of the royal family.</p>

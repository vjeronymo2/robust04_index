			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / Letter: Timetable for telecoms tenders Sir, Re your your editorial 'Cable telecoms' (May 19) I was left wondering whether all you were suggesting was that one of the government's proposals in the duopoly review be brought forward by 10 1/2 months. The March 1991 white paper stated that 'the government intends. . .from April 1 1994 to allow the national PTOs (public telecommunications operators) to tender in their own right for a local delivery service licence for any part of the country not at that time covered by a cable or local delivery licence. Any such application would fall to be considered under the normal ITC procedures as specified at that time. . .' Michael Scargill, 9 Cheapside, London EC2V 6AD</p>

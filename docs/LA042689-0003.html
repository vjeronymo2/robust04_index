			<p><P> April 26, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REPORTERS ON TV;  </P> <P> IS STARDOM WEAKENING THE PRESS?  </P> <P> He made no secret about it. Chris Matthews wanted to be a pundit, a player, a  face on the Sunday political talk shows.  </P> <P> He discussed it with friends when he was speech writer and spokesman for House  Speaker Thomas P. (Tip) O'Neill Jr., and he even described writing his book,  "Hardball," as a way of establishing his credentials.  </P> <P> So, two years ago, he and executive editor Larry Kramer of the San Francisco  Examiner struck a deal to make it happen. Matthews would become an Examiner  columnist, complete with the prestigious title of Washington bureau chief. "He  needed to be a journalist," Kramer explains now, "to have the kind of  respectability to be on TV. That's what we brought to the table."  </P> <P> </P> <P> A Talent for TV  </P> <P> On the other side, Matthews brought the talents that work on TV. Kramer needed  visibility for his afternoon newspaper, and Matthews could provide that by  appearing on "any one of the 50 shows . . . with our name under his picture."  </P> <P> Today, the success of their bargain offers a lesson -- disturbing to some --  about the growing importance of appearing on television if one is to be  considered important and influential in print.  </P> <P> Even though few in Washington see his column, Matthews has become such a  familiar face on the TV talk shows that, earlier this year, Washingtonian  magazine named him "one of the top 50 journalists," in the city. Says Kramer,  with the candor of an editor who knows business: "I should be paying him out of  the marketing budget."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Coaches for Television  </P> <P> The Matthews case is not the only sign of the times. The Chicago Tribune now  employs a media consultant to coach and promote its Washington correspondents  for television. USA Today regularly features its newspaper reporters as experts  on its TV show, hoping that one helps sell the other. And when one newspaper  chain recently asked columnist Jack Germond to recommend candidates for  Washington bureau chief, it noted that being a regular on TV was a  prerequisite.  </P> <P> "When that happens," said Germond, "things have clearly gotten screwed up."  </P> <P> Some reporters fear the culture of the TV programs may even be changing the  basic values of print journalism, downgrading by degrees the traditional skills  of reporting, neutrality and objectivity while elevating the skills that get  one and keep one on TV -- a knack for asserting opinions, a talent for thinking  in sound bites rather than nuance, and a skill for honing an attention-getting  public persona.  </P> <P> The impact of TV opinion journalism, some worry, may go deeper yet:  </P> <P>  -- Is it making public discourse more rancorous, for instance, if the rewards  go to those willing to stake out more controversial positions?  </P> <P>  -- Is it mirroring the devaluation of substance that has occurred in politics  if reporters' interpretations of events become more important than covering the  events?  </P> <P>  -- And, when print journalists who appear on TV become as well known as the  officials they cover, does that move the press away from the arm's-length,  sometimes adversarial relationship with government that was underscored with  coverage of Vietnam and Watergate?  </P> <P> "It is a whole new world," said Sue Ducat, producer of "Washington Week in  Review." "The whole phenomenon of journalists realizing that visibility can  boost their careers in a number of ways has really taken off."  </P> <P> Ducat, in fact, is inundated with requests from print reporters who want to  appear on the show. Some send her same-day faxes of their stories; others  deliver videotapes of their previous TV appearances.  </P> <P> So powerful is television's invisible wave, the medium changes not only the  message but also the messenger.  </P> <P> </P> <P> A Changing Format  </P> <P> The appearance of print reporters on TV is hardly new. "Meet the Press," which  uses reporters to interview politicians, is NBC's longest-running show, and  "Washington Week in Review" 22 years ago began having newspaper and  newsmagazine journalists report and then analyze the week's news.  </P> <P> But the rise of the political talk programs more rightly dates back about 10  years, to when "Agronsky &amp; Co." and later "This Week with David Brinkley"  started asking reporters not merely to interview officials and offer a little  analysis, but to assert their own opinions flat out.  </P> <P> The success of such shows soon led to reporter round tables on "Face the  Nation," "The Today Show," "Nightline" and others. Today, the National  Journal's guide to Washington lists 21 public affairs programs that have print  reporters as guests.  </P> <P> What's more, TV audience-share figures suggest that the more gusto reporters  give their opinions, the better. "Agronsky," for instance, was quickly  overwhelmed in the ratings by "The McLaughlin Group," a kind of  opinion-entertainment program that appears on both commercial and PBS stations.  And that has influenced others.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 2 Faces for the Nation  </P> <P> McLaughlin regulars Patrick Buchanan and Robert Novak recently started CNN's  "Capitol Gang" in the McLaughlin mold. Even CBS' venerable "Face the Nation"  now has two kinds of round tables, executive producer Karen Sughrue said, "one  where we use people as analysts -- 'Do you think Jim Wright will last?' -- and  others where we ask 'Should he last?' "  </P> <P> To many in print journalism these shows do not signal anything dangerous. For  one thing, only about 50 print reporters appear regularly on TV, and most of  them are veterans at reporting who seem unlikely to be corrupted by the  experience.  </P> <P> What's more, if people don't take the shows seriously, some argue, they pose no  danger. The key, said Germond, a nationally syndicated political columnist and  regular on the televised McLaughlin show, is whether people recognize that "it  is a half hour of being a dancing bear to make a better living and . . . not a  serious journalistic exercise."  </P> <P> Not all participants consider themselves dancing bears -- "It is just a  different kind of journalism," said fellow McLaughlinite and New Republic  writer Fred Barnes. And many say that to dismiss the TV programs as mere  entertainment is self-deluding.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Books, Speaking Tours  </P> <P> At least in degrees, TV already has changed which print journalists are  rewarded and why. Although payment for a single appearance on most shows ranges  from $200 to $1,000, being on TV today is the surest way for a print reporter  to get rich. It leads to book contracts and, most lucrative of all, to the  lecture circuit.  </P> <P> Lecture circuit appearances have become sufficiently common that they now are  an issue in the Senate press gallery, which grants credentials to reporters  covering Congress. The gallery has long limited press passes to those whose  primary income comes from a news organization. Today, many long-standing press  gallery members are making so much money speaking that they no longer qualify,  and there is pressure to change the rules.  </P> <P> The discovery that TV can turn reporters into sought-after celebrities has not  been lost on the news organizations they work for, either. Today reporters who  appear on television can command better assignments, more prestige within their  organizations and higher pay.  </P> <P> Newsweek, which gives reporters cash bonuses for television appearances, hired  Morton M. Kondracke as Washington bureau chief after he became a regular on TV,  just as U.S. News &amp; World Report found an editor in TV commentator David  Gergen. (Kondracke has since returned to the New Republic; Gergen remains at  U.S. News as editor at large but is no longer the editor.)  </P> <P> Several prominent bureau chiefs in Washington also appear regularly on  television. They include Jack Nelson of The Times, on "Washington Week in  Review," Albert Hunt of the Wall Street Journal, on the "Capital Gang," and  Strobe Talbott of Time magazine, on "Inside Washington" (formerly "Agronsky  &amp; Co.").  </P> <P> Matthews' career may be the most unusual. Examiner Editor Kramer not only found  someone he thought would be good on TV and gave him the title of bureau chief  -- though his domain is just himself and one reporter -- Kramer also arranged  to have Matthews' column syndicated by King Features. He says that was "the  only way to get even half" of what Matthews had been making as a Washington  consultant. Matthews now has more than 60 client papers, many of them picked up  when the King syndicate's other liberal writer, Nicholas Von Hoffman, stopped  writing his column.  </P> <P> Many publications, such as U.S. News and USA Today, see having their reporters  on television as good business. They believe having them on the air will  persuade readers to buy their publications.  </P> <P> And some editors think it helps their staffs do their jobs. The Chicago  Tribune, for instance, pays its reporters' TV coach out of its news budget. "We  don't circulate heavily in this town," Washington bureau chief Nicholas Horrock  said. But the TV talk programs do, so appearing on the shows enhances access to  sources for the Tribune's correspondents in the capital.  </P> <P> The New York Times' policy concerning TV appearances is about the most  restrictive of any news organization, and it asks only that a reporter not  "appear with the frequency that would suggest you have become a regular" on any  one program, according to Assistant Managing Editor Warren Hoge. Yet how often  is too often is decided case by case, and in the case of really big-name  reporters, according to TV producers, it gets a little fuzzy.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Times also asks its reporters not to become regulars on any  program, the editor, Shelby Coffey III, said. Nelson's appearances on  "Washington Week," according to Coffey, comply with the policy.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Values Under Question  </P> <P> To some, the institutional rewards TV appearances can bring send a signal to  all print journalists, a signal that bears examining. "What bothers me is the  message (in part) of what it is we value and esteem," said Washington Post  writer David Broder.  </P> <P> And the values that at least some TV programs esteem are not necessarily those  that make a good print reporter.  </P> <P> "I need someone who is glib, colorful, whose thoughts can be condensed into a  conversational style," "Face the Nation" executive producer Karen Sughrue says.  </P> <P> Other producers mentioned irreverence, wit, a colorful manner or an ability to  spark "a good fight," or, as McLaughlin producer Kennedy put it, "someone who  is not afraid to go out on a limb."  </P> <P> In the climate of at least a few of the shows, some journalists say, staking  out a point on the political spectrum seems more important than finding an  argument that is reasoned or persuasive.  </P> <P> And journalist Hodding Carter III wonders about "the effect on public  discourse, generally. Do Americans think they are getting anything of substance  from any of this?"  </P> <P> </P> <P> Stirring Up Rancor  </P> <P> Writing in the New York Review of Books two years ago, reporter James Fallows  suggested that the values of the talk shows were making public debate more  rancorous if, to build audiences, the shows were rewarding those who made for a  good fight rather than a plausible argument.  </P> <P> "Everything depends on the tone of the show," argued Broder, echoing a widely  held sentiment. Are reporters showing up on TV to analyze why things happened  or "in the role of policy advocates" saying what should happen?  </P> <P> With the success of the more entertaining shows, even that distinction may be  getting blurry. How many viewers, for instance, recognize the difference  between the advocative versus the merely analytical panels on "Face the  Nation"?  </P> <P> To those who participate in the programs, the most obvious danger is that the  more lucrative side of their activities comes from something other than  reporting. And the more one wants to build one's empire, the less time one has  to cover the beat.  </P> <P> "We both know there are a lot of people in this town who write columns and  engage in journalism on the run," said Paul Duke, moderator of PBS' "Washington  Week in Review."  </P> <P> Again, it may come down to how seriously journalists and the public take the  political talk shows.  </P> <P> Those who appear on the programs sometimes talk about having a sense that their  words vanish like soap bubbles; they say that people who recognize them from  their TV appearances rarely comment on what they said.  </P> <P> "It all invites a sort of lazy opinion-mongering," said Rolling Stone  Washington editor William Greider, who has appeared on the the programs. "My  sense," Greider said, "is that some people are confusing it with reporting."  </P> <P> Matthews, at least, is quite open in his attitude toward reporting: he rarely  does any for the twice-weekly column and weekly analysis that he writes.  </P> <P> "I don't think interviewing people or doing basic snooping is that much of a  pure form of information-gathering," Matthews explained.  </P> <P> </P> <P> New Job Definition  </P> <P> Instead, he believes that, "Every time I give a speech I get challenged, or  every time I talk on TV. The process of writing is formative, and to say that  you are not thinking, not developing information, I don't think that is valid."  </P> <P> It is a novel approach -- a journalist who doesn't believe in doing reporting  -- but Matthews goes further. He describes what he does -- on TV, in lectures  or in print -- as providing audiences with a "colorful expose," a term that  once meant investigative reporting.  </P> <P> It is an attitude, in a sense, that reflects what has occurred in political  campaigns: The way an event is interpreted can have more effect than the event  itself. In the new news-media culture, in which reporters' opinions are more  highly rewarded than their ability to uncover what has happened, the "spin" put  on events becomes more important than the events themselves.  </P> <P> There is also one other problem with the rise of the shows and their influence,  said Broder of the Post. The programs are helping to blur the line between  journalists and the officials they cover, he says. This raises the danger of  journalists allowing themselves "to become androgynous Washington insiders," as  he put it in a speech last December, "all of us seeking and wielding influence  in our own ways."  </P> <P> The journalist as Washington insider -- rendering opinions, offering advice --  is indeed part of the ethos of these programs.  </P> <P> And now some of the shows also mix journalists with partisans and officials as  equal players on their panels.  </P> <P> On "Capital Gang," not only does the "gang" make no distinction between Patrick  Buchanan, conservative advocate and sometime government official, and Al Hunt,  Wall Street Journal Washington bureau chief, but each week, a different  politician joins the panel as an equal, not as a guest to be queried. "Welcome,  Charlie," Buchanan tells Rep. Charles B. Rangel (D-N.Y.), insider to insider.  </P> <P> Even on the more staid programs, the symbols of distance between reporter and  official are no longer considered important. Gone are the desks that once  separated the supposed interrogators from their subject on "Meet the Press" or  "Face the Nation."  </P> <P> Greider, of Rolling Stone, worries that the ethos of the Washington  celebrity-insider on screen "translates into a sort of social corruption" off  screen, in which journalists become the social equals of the officials they  cover, in effect, "distancing themselves from the public."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Friendships With Sources  </P> <P> "There is no doubt in my mind that where you develop special relationships  (with officials) that there are times when you are willing to turn a blind eye  to minor criticisms," said John McLaughlin, a former White House aide now best  known for his TV program.  </P> <P> A reporter does that, he argues, "in order to preserve a source for a major  expose or major policy issue . . . . It is a question of preserving the  connection for the greater good."  </P> <P> To others, such as New York Times columnist Anthony Lewis, this kind of talk is  a dangerous sign that the press is becoming weaker and less responsible.  </P> <P> "The established press in this country has to a large extent reverted" to an  old relationship with government, Lewis argues, that predates Vietnam and  Watergate. "We are an adversary only on the margins, not on the fundamentals  that challenge power."  </P> <P> The celebrity status of the press is only one factor, Lewis believes, but it is  a problem, nonetheless.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Top 50' Analyzed  </P> <P> Whether Lewis is right or not, the political talk shows have left their mark on  print journalism. Though it was a self-appointed and subjective judge,  Washingtonian magazine's selection of the "50 most influential journalists" in  the Capital this year included only nine print reporters who did not appear on  television. Another 11 were editors or bureau chiefs included by virtue of  their jobs. The other 30 were all TV reporters or print reporters who regularly  appeared on television.  </P> <P> "I can't prove this," said Barbara Matusow, the author of the Washingtonian  article who, with the editors of the magazine, compiled the list of influential  journalists' names. "But I really think that you find young people in print  journalism hustling themselves as a product . . . in a way you wouldn't have  before . . . . The pot of gold is so much bigger today (than ever before), it  is just unimaginable."  </P></p>

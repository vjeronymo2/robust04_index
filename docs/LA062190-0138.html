			<p><P> June 21, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA JUNIOR TENNIS;  </P> <P> PETERSON STEPS INTO SPOTLIGHT  </P> <P> He's an overnight sensation who insists he's not.  </P> <P> In April, he won the 16-and-under division at the Easter Bowl tournament in  Miami, his first national championship. He said he wasn't surprised. Others  were, and wanted to know more about him. They were eager to see how he would  fare next.  </P> <P> A month later, he swept to the 16s title at the Ojai Valley tournament.  Observers of junior tennis nodded in appreciation of this latest, gifted player  to emerge from a horde of talented age-group players.  </P> <P> Meet Adam Peterson, a 15-year-old from Orange who recently finished his  sophomore year at Mater Dei High School.  </P> <P> Until this year, he was merely the younger, promising brother of Dax Peterson,  a standout at Mater Dei who now plays at San Diego State.  </P> <P> Peterson maintains he is well-known.  </P> <P> "I've been seeded pretty high in some national tournaments," he said after  winning at Ojai. "People know me."  </P> <P> That's true in the tightly woven circle of junior tennis. But if he keeps  playing this well, he also will turn the heads of casual followers of the  sport.  </P> <P> His string of victories this spring has earned him the No. 1 seeding in the  Southern California Junior Sectional tournament, which begins Saturday at Los  Caballeros Racquet Club in Fountain Valley. He has never finished higher than  fourth, but figures to be one of the favorites to reach the final on July 1.  </P> <P> How has he done it?  </P> <P> Peterson said he hasn't varied his routine. He spends as much time practicing  at the same clubs, with the same people as he did five years ago when he began  to take the sport seriously.  </P> <P> Really, he can't explain it.  </P> <P> "I just try to play every day," he said.  </P> <P> Buoyed by his recent victories, his confidence seems to be soaring. His  movements have been precise and assured this spring, helping his game reach new  levels.  </P> <P> Said David Roditi of San Clemente, after knuckling under to Peterson's  relentless pressure in a 6-1, 6-1 loss in the Ojai final: "He didn't let me do  anything today. That's the best I've ever seen him play."  </P> <P> Peterson seems unfazed by such praise.  </P> <P> "I'm pleased with my (recent) performances," he said. "I just wanted to  practice for the big tournaments. I wanted to do well. That was my goal."  </P> <P> Peterson began playing at age "seven or eight," nudged into the sport by his  family. Not long after, the Petersons moved from Toledo, Ohio, to Orange County  where the weather was more inviting to year-round play.  </P> <P> When he was "nine or 10" he began to play age-group tournaments with some  success. He began playing national tournaments at 12.  </P> <P> But his first national title didn't come until he won the Easter Bowl title in  his first try this spring. Last year, he was ranked only among the top 35 in  the country and his best finish at a national tournament was the round of 16 at  the hardcourt championships in San Jose last summer.  </P> <P> Looking back, he calls the Easter Bowl tournament "a great experience."  </P> <P> "It's hard to explain," he said. "It was fun because it was my first national  title. I didn't think about winning when I went there."  </P> <P> But on April 14, he breezed past J.J. Jackson of Hendersonville, N.C., 6-2,  6-2, for the title.  </P> <P> "I was playing really good toward the end of the tournament," he said.  </P> <P> Since his victory at Ojai, Peterson won the Angelus League singles title and  advanced to the quarterfinals of the Southern Section tournament, losing to  Peter Jeschke of Santa Barbara.  </P> <P> He said he expects the upcoming sectional tournament to be as difficult as any  he has played this year.  </P> <P> "I want to put myself in a position to do well," Peterson said. "If I win,  it'll be great. If not, then I'll try again next year."  </P> <P> Sectional Notes  </P> <P> About 1,800 players are scheduled to play for championships in five divisions  for boys and girls. Qualifying rounds begin Saturday with the main draw  scheduled to begin Wednesday. The finals are scheduled July 1 at 9 a.m. . . .

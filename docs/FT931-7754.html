			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Government seeks summer approval for Maastricht THE GOVERNMENT is determined to secure ratification of the Maastricht treaty by the summer, despite the emergence last night of fresh confusion over the possible consequences of new amendments relating to the social chapter. Senior ministers believe the legislation can receive parliamentary approval before the summer recess and would be prepared to see parliament sitting into August to hasten ratification. Normally both the Commons and the Lords would break up for the summer in late July, returning in October to tie up loose ends. Yesterday, German Chancellor Helmut Kohl warned that at least 10 European countries would go ahead with their unity plans if either Britain or Denmark failed to endorse the Maastricht treaty within six months. Mr Kohl's statement reiterated a position he outlined at the European Community summit in Edinburgh last December and officials in both Bonn and Downing Street sought to play down the impact of Mr Kohl's words. But the Maastricht bill hit a further snag yesterday as hours of debate were lost in a renewed row over the government's U-turn last week on the legal effect of passing an opposition amendment on the social chapter. And in seeking to explain the government's position to a noisy and crowded Commons, Sir Nicholas Lyell, attorney-general, appeared to admit the possibility of more disruption as a result of fresh social chapter-related amendments. Labour will now turn its attention to an amendment which would exclude the social protocol from the part of the bill giving the European parliament more powers. Though Sir Nicholas seemed to suggest that if such an amendment were passed it could wreck the ratification process, that has not ruled it out so far as the Labour front bench is concerned. The opposition has time to decide on tactics. But such an amendment offers the most likely prospect of an effective alliance between the opposition and Tory Euro-rebels against the government. Yesterday's hiccup came as Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, said the government would have the authority to meet the administrative costs of the social chapter for which Britain could be liable. In a letter to Sir Teddy Taylor, MP for Southend East and a leading Tory Euro-sceptic, Mr Hurd said parliament's assent to the Maastricht bill at the third reading would enable the government to ratify the treaty. 'That includes the social protocol and Britain's obligation to pay its share of associated administrative costs.' In the Commons, Sir Nicholas underlined the government's insistence that defeat on the original Labour amendment would not wreck the treaty, arguing there was 'no constitutional impropriety' in proceeding with ratification under such circumstances. 'Parliament cannot pick and choose which treaty obligations to accept,' he said. 'But it can prevent ratification of the entire treaty by refusing to enact the bill.' He declined requests for his advice on the legal effect of passing the amendment to be published, saying he was not aware of any precedent.</p>

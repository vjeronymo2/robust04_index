			<p>BFN     [Text] The Jerusalem City Council decided on a series of  measures to prevent Yasir 'Arafat's visit in the city. In a  special session held this morning, the mayor and all his eight  deputies decided to set up three action committees: a public  relations committee, a financial committee, and a committee  which would organize a huge protest campaign. Our correspondent  Aviv Bushinsky reports that, among other things, the Jerusalem  City Council plans to fly in protesters from overseas aboard  special planes.</p>

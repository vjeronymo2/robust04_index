El Paso Natural Gas Company <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 --> [Docket No. CP94&hyph;575&hyph;000] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Take notice that on June 1, 1994, El Paso Natural Gas Company (El Paso), Post Office Box 1942, El Paso, Texas 79978, filed an application at Docket No. CP94&hyph;575&hyph;000, pursuant to Section 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act (NGA) for a certificate of public convenience and necessity authorizing El Paso to construct and operate its San Juan Triangle Expansion Project, all as more fully set forth in the application which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> El Paso proposes to construct and operate about 29.7 miles of 34-inch loop pipeline with appurtenances on the Loop Line from Blanco Plant to the Gallup Compressor Station, and to install a replacement compressor on one of the turbines at El Paso's Gallup Compressor Station.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> El Paso states that the approximate cost of the project is $25.8 million, with a resultant third year cost of service of only approximately $4 million which is an impact on current rates, assuming a 100 percent load factor, of $.0021 per dth. El Paso proposes rolled-in rate treatment for these costs in its first general system-wide rate proceeding following the in-service date of the project.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> El Paso states that in its ongoing review of the operating requirements and capabilities of its interstate pipeline system, together with the potential availability of additional volumes to its system, El Paso has determined that expansion of its San Juan Triangle is warranted. El Paso states that the existing summer design capacity of the San Juan Triangle System is 2,460 MMcf of natural gas per day. El Paso's asserts that its studies indicate that the total supply available from the San Juan Basin will approach 3300 MMcf per day in 1997. El Paso states that the proposed facilities would allow it to receive additional quantities of natural gas which are available today and are projected to become available in the immediate future from the San Juan Basin area of a New Mexico and Colorado.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> El Paso states that it does not seek specific authorization to transport gas through its proposed facilities for specific shippers. El Paso states that it would render transportation services through such facilities under Part 284 of the Commission's regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> El Paso further states that it would charge its current and effective Part 284 rates for transportation through the proposed facilities. El Paso further states that it would propose in its first general system-wide rate proceeding following the in-service date of the project to ``roll-in'' the actual costs of the completed facilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> El Paso requests that the Commission issue authorization no later than December 31, 1994, because it must initiate construction soon thereafter in order to meet a scheduled in-service date of July 1, 1995.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comment date: July 5, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph F at the end of this notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 2.

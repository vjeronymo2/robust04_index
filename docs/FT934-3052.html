			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / Leading Article: Reform boost for Whitehall The UK government has been subjected to mounting criticism over its programme of civil service reform. Numbers of civil servants have been rising, the market-testing programme has made disappointing progress, and measures to open top jobs to outsiders have been watered down. Some critics have concluded that reforms have been undermined by the opposition of senior Whitehall mandarins and ministerial weakness. Yesterday's announcement that the government is stepping up the pace of privatising executive agencies is therefore welcome. Over 90 agencies have now been established, delivering a wide range of services from the payment of benefits to the registration of patents. Another 44 candidates have been identified, and by the end of 1995, four out of five civil servants will be in agencies. The creation of agencies has been a success story, with improvements in service and a new focus on the job to be done. But it has become an end in itself which has preserved largely intact the Whitehall machine. Many agencies perform functions which could be privatised, such as the payment of wages and scientific research. Others could be put under commercial management in the same way as the Atomic Weapons Establishment at Aldermaston. In local government, public services are routinely provided by the private sector - even in sensitive areas such as the collection of council tax and the payment of benefits. A greater use of private provision in central government could provide similar benefits in efficiency and quality of service. Civil service departments are supposed to examine alternatives such as privatisation and contracting out before each agency is established and at regular intervals thereafter. In only one case so far has the outcome been privatisation. The message coming out of the Cabinet Office yesterday is that the examination of alternatives will henceforth be more rigorous. Departments will be required to consider privatising agencies much more thoroughly before renewing their mandates. More important, companies which think they could take over agency activities or manage them more effectively are to be encouraged to bring forward their proposals. The premium will be on innovation and value added, rather than on simply taking over the existing civil service organisation and making it work better. Whether this initiative produces the potential benefits will still depend on the enthusiasm of top mandarins for radical change. They may remain reluctant to cede parts of their empires to the private sector. However, the freeze on civil service running costs imposed in the Budget should encourage a new realism in Whitehall's top echelons. Permanent secretaries now face a period in which scope for pay rises will depend entirely on their ability to find efficiency savings. With 'more for less' the rule for the next three years, the civil service will find the help of the private sector essential.</p>

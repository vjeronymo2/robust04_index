			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / CBI expects recovery to be broader-based The recovery will become broad-based this year, with investment and trade playing a greater role in economic growth and inflation kept below government targets, the Confederation of British Industry says today in its economic forecast. The recovery has largely weathered April's tax rises, the CBI says in its forecast which is more optimistic than its last one in February. It also calls for a period of stable interest rates. Although consumer spending is expected to slow slightly as a result of the tax rises, predictions for consumer spending for the year have been revised up to 2.5 per cent from 1.9 per cent in February. The recovery is expected to become broader-based, with investment and trade predicted to play a greater role after months of consumer-led growth. Investment is predicted to rise 2 per cent this year and exports 4.6 per cent. Overall, the economy is expected to grow 2.4 per cent this year and 2.5 per cent next year. Partly as a result of this, the CBI has abandoned its call for lower interest rates. Although it believes that inflation and growth in average earnings are likely to remain low, it assumes that interest rates will remain flat this year before rising to 6 per cent at the end of next year. The optimistic forecast was backed yesterday by strong data from its monthly industrial trends survey, conducted in the second half of April and first half of May among 1,190 companies who account for roughly half of UK manufacturing. More than half of the companies reported that their total order books were normal, with 22 per cent saying they are above normal and 25 per cent saying order books are below normal. This negative balance of 3 per cent compares with negative balances of 17 per cent in April and 13 per cent in March, and is the most optimistic since 1989. Export order books were also at their best levels since 1990. The proportion of companies reporting below-normal levels compared to above-normal levels was a negative balance of 2 per cent compared with negative balances of 9 per cent in April. The companies faring best are medium-sized, with those employing between 200 and 499 people reporting the best export orders. Companies employing fewer than 200 were the only ones to report export orders below normal. Meanwhile, the intermediate goods industry, which supplies raw materials and components to manufacturers, was markedly more optimistic about output than the capital and consumer goods industries. A total of 86 per cent of shipbuilders said their domestic order books were above normal, while 87 per cent of aerospace manufacturers said they were below normal. However, most car and food manufacturers reported normal sales. Meanwhile, the metals and manufacturing sector as a whole reported above-normal sales, but less encouraging exports, suggesting their growth is domestic-led.</p>

			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / Fashion: Clothes' sexual challenge - Katrina Blandy on cross-dressing since Adam and Eve Ever since Adam and Eve clothed themselves in fig leaves, cross-dressing between the sexes has been a topic which is both risque and overplayed. The clothes you wear define not only the type of person you are, but also your sexuality. To give his female characters freedom, Shakespeare would disguise them as men and let them loose on stage. But while Ganymede-Rosalind thinks she has the upper hand, Shakespeare's audiences would be laughing at her. A boy actor dressed as a girl, then disguised as a boy to dupe her beloved was a popular and effective way of challenging apparent sexuality as defined by costume. With the arrival of the Japanese show Takarazuka at London's Coliseum, the challenge to clothes as definitive of sexuality has taken a much more modern turn. Members of the all-female cast train for years to earn a place in the company, but only the most successful are chosen to play men. They immediately develop the distinctive Takarazuka quiff, and in doing so mark themselves out as men who are women. Here is the opposite to the Shakespearean joke, and, considering the Japanese patriarchal society, one that is tolerated remarkably openly. Except here, the raison d'etre of this particular sex change is to increase the women's understanding of the role of men and thus to make the women into better wives, so that the dangerous joke is rendered harmless. This summer's prevailing look of soft pyjama trousers sharply offsets the earlier sharp-edged city suit. Women in the 1980s who wore bold, distinctive suits to the boardroom were issuing a definite challenge to their male colleagues. These primitive distinctions between the sexes have now blurred, so that fashion of the 1990s is more about the person you are, rather than the sex you are. However, the challenge of cross-dressing remains. At the Central Saint Martin's 1994 graduate show, Juliet Gatto showed a collection of humanoid invaders. Aliens are usually asexual, but Gatto was careful to mark out the sex of her model by making him promenade with a large penis on the front of his clothes. However tacky this may seem to some, it had a deeper purpose in explicitly flaunting what humans since Adam and Eve have been trying to hide. Visually, the point she was making is obvious: everybody knows that beneath their clothes they are either male or female. What Gatto achieved was not subtle but it was effective, because it focused on the symbiotic relationship between clothes and sexuality. Here, the issue of sexuality was unambiguously displayed on the outside of the clothes rather than hidden beneath. The child in the fairytale of the Emperor's New Clothes points out that the Emperor is naked. The child's eye sees and acknowledges what adults all around fear to do. Naked, the essence of the Emperor as a man is all the more on view. Yet the crowds around still believe him to be dressed until they are told otherwise. What clothes seem to do for sexuality or personality is to refract and direct a certain attitude or posture. Women wearing suits or men wearing kilts are all making - or trying to make - a statement about themselves. The question is whether the wearer is in control, or the designer. If a designer clothes you, rather than you wearing the clothes, then the passer-by - much like Shakespeare's audience or the child in the fairytale - is having the last laugh at your expense.</p>

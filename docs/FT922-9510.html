			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / Sweden wants its EC application speeded up MR Carl Bildt, Sweden's prime minister, will seek the British government's support in speeding up his country's application to join the European Community during a meeting with Mr John Major, the British prime minister, today. The meeting comes amid doubts over the feasibility of Sweden's self-imposed timetable for entry. Mr Bildt would like the British EC presidency, which starts its six-month term on July 1, to give EC enlargement top priority. He insists formal negotiations must start with Brussels early next year and be concluded by the end of 1993. This would ensure time for a national referendum on Sweden's entry to be held during the first half of 1994. Such speed is dictated by the Swedish constitution. Any change in the country's fundamental laws requires two identical approvals by the Swedish parliament, with the first given not less than nine months before a general election and the second after an election. Sweden will elect its next parliament on 20 September 1994, which means any EC entry agreement must be submitted by 18 December next year, or be delayed until 1 January 1998. It would need a majority of parliament's constitutional committee to waive this provision. Another concern for Mr Bildt is the sign of growing opposition within Sweden to EC entry.

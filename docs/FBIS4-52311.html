			<p>BFN     [Text] Hanoi VNA May 9 - 'One enemy is too many, a hundred  friends are too few.' Such is the Vietnamese saying which is  often quoted these days by mouth and in deed by the Vietnamese  leaders and also the man on the street. The latest examples are  the visits to Indonesia and Iran by President Le Duc Anh, to  India by Chairman of the National Assembly Nong Duc Manh, the  visits to Vietnam by dignitaries from the Czech Republic and  Ukraine, and the constant influx of foreign business people who  visit to probe the market opportunities in Vietnam. American  businesses even held an exhibition in Hanoi to advertize their  industrial and consumer goods.    In the 50 days from March Vietnam hosted over 50 foreign  delegations of ministerial level and higher and thousands of  business people. Most notable were the visits by the presidents  of Mongolia and the Philippines, the prime ministers of  Singapore, Thailand, Sweden and Australia, the deputy prime  minister of Russia, and HRH Princess Anne and minister of state  for external relations of Great Britain. During the same period,  General Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam Do Muoi  visited Malaysia, other Vietnamese leaders and high officials  visited countries in Asia and America. In the coming days,  President Le Duc Anh, Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet and Deputy  Prime Minister Tran Duc Luong are expected to visit various  countries and regions in the world.    On all these occasions, Vietnamese leaders reassured their  guests and hosts that 'Vietnam wants to be friend all the  countries in the world', that 'Vietnam is trying to build a  law-governed state and a strong country, a rich people and an  equitable and civilised society', and that 'Vietnam pursues an  open, independent and sovereign foreign policy to diversify and  multilateralise its international relations'.    These are the wishes of the Vietnamese people who have  fought  through four decades of war to defend and build their country.  They are also in line with the current trend of the world.    In fact, Vietnam has been moving along these lines since the  beginning of the national renewal, especially since the start of  the nineties. It has made very important initial achievements,  including the way the country is viewed in the eyes of the  people of the world. Instead of Vietnamese fleeing the country,  the world is seeing Vietnam make an annual GDP growth of 7 to 8,  which is expected to climb to 9 or 10 over the next few years,  export about 2 million tons of rice a year and host over 850  joint-venture and foreign invested projects with a total  prescribed capital of over 8.5 billion USD. Visiting these  joint ventures now, one will hear English, French, German,  Japanese, Chinese, Korean and many other languages.    The world also sees an increased presence of American  businesses in Vietnam. The lifting of the US embargo against  Vietnam has finally driven home to many Americans that they have  come too late in the race into the Vietnamese market, and that  American economic interests in Vietnam are already, really  sizable. Deputy Foreign Minister Le Mai told this writer that  when the remaining few consular matters are settled, Vietnam and  the US will open representative offices at each other's capital.    When that comes, it will be yet more proof of Vietnam's  successes in its renewal cause which has helped Vietnam improve  its bilateral relations with many countries, regions and  international institutions and organisations.</p>

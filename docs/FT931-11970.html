			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Royal begins break-up of reinsurance side ROYAL Insurance is to begin dismantling its reinsurance subsidiary, Royal Re, in line with a strategy of focusing on core direct insurance business. Some parts of Royal Re's portfolio - which generated more than Pounds 150m in premium income in 1992 - will be transferred to its industrial risks subsidiary, Royal Global. The rest of the company's UK-based reinsurance business will be run-off. While Royal Re's US arm, American Royal Re, will continue to trade for the moment, it is understood that the group will seek to sell the operation, which accounted for under 20 per cent of premium income last year. 'The market has seen a deterioration in results due to inherent problems and an unprecedented number of natural catastrophe losses', explained Mr Richard Gamble, group chief executive. 'Against this background, together with Royal Re's relatively small worldwide market share', it was in 'shareholders' best interests to reduce its involvement in the market', added Mr Gamble. In order to facilitate an 'orderly withdrawal' from the market Royal said it had acquired the 20 per cent minority stake in Royal Re previously held by Aachen Re. Yesterday's announcement follows a number of unsuccessful attempts to sell Royal Re. Last year the group said reinsurance was identified as a 'non-core business in the longer-term'. Other insurance companies have also reduced their involvement in reinsurance in recent years. Last year Prudential announced it was reducing its involvement in general reinsurance business in order to focus on life reinsurance. Legal &amp; General sold its reinsurance subsidiary, Victory Re, to ING, the Dutch banking and insurance group, in July 1990.</p>

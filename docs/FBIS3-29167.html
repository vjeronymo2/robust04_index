The premier relayed his desire to meet on Tuesday afternoon  with LDP President Kono through Chief Cabinet Secretary  Masayoshi Takemura, Mori told a news conference. But Kono and  Mori rejected the offer for an informal one-on-one session  because they agreed this is not the time for such a meeting,  Mori said.    The LDP secretary general cited as a reason for the party's  refusal to comply with the request the start on Wednesday of  Diet deliberations on the third supplementary budget for fiscal  1993 ending March 31. "It may affect the morale of our party  ranks if the two meet and talk secretively together on the eve  of Diet debate at its plenary sessions," Mori said.    He said he conveyed to Takemura that the LDP may agree on a  Kono-Hosokawa summit once the extra budget, intended to boost  the languishing Japanese economy, clears the Diet.    Hosokawa and Kono met on February 2 along with their  respective associates to exchange views mainly on the slumping  economy and strained economic relations with the United States.</p>

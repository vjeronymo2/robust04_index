The President said one major purpose of his Southeast Asian  trip was to promote economic cooperation. To illustrate the  need, he said, Taiwan's future economic development must rely on  continuous investment abroad to create more sales opportunities  and to secure the supply of essential raw materials.    He described his visits to the three countries and his  discussions with the leaders of the governments involved as  fruitful, especially in the strengthening of economic  cooperation.    When asked what about the diplomatic implications of his  trip, Li replied he did not expect to see any immediate gains in  this respect. He said much more must be done and it takes time  for the achievement of concrete results.    In fact, Li's meetings with President Suharto of Indonesia,  President Fidel Ramos of the Philippines and King Phumiphon  Adunyadet of Thailand in themselves represented a major  achievement of his pragmatic diplomacy. None of the three  countries have formal ties with Taiwan.    Asked about his chances of being invited to the 1994 summit  meeting of APEC (Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation) leaders, Li  said he did not bring forward the matter in his meeting with  Suharto, who will play host to the event this year.    Li said he was not sure that he would be invited. But the  President indicated he will not insist on participating, should  that arouse protest from Beijing and consequently affect the  convention of the summit. The Republic of China [ROC] after all  wants to be a nation having the respect of all, he added.    He was also asked to comment on the repeated protests  Mainland China lodged with the three countries, warning their  governments not to receive him. Li said those interventions  were unreasonable and surely were not mature policies.    The President noted that, despite Beijing's continued  protests, the three nations still went ahead to discuss  bilateral relations with the ROC and made clear to him that they  want to be friends with this nation. Li did not believe that  his Southeast Asian tour will have adverse effects on Taiwan's  relations with the mainland. He said he did not hold any  political attempts in embarking on his Southeast Asian tour,  explaining that he had no idea of trying to use the trip to  promote a two-China policy.    Li continued that, since Taiwan and the mainland have  remained divided because of political differences, this island  must decide, as in the past, its own course of development. And  he believes that in dealing with an intransigent Beijing, the  best way, is to step up Taiwan's own strength, and use it [to]  win the mainland's recognition.    He is certainly right.</p>

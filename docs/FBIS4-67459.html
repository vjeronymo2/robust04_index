			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Figures and Facts"] </F>   [Text] As follows from the results of radiation tests,  this year the concentration of tritium in the topsoil on the  territory of Kiev is largely lower than admissible. However, in  some places, it was tens of times the normal value and a hundred  times the norm in subsurface waters. The sources of tritium  contamination have not been determined....    At the same time, in the Chernobyl zone, over the last year,  the content of strontium and cesium in almost all the water  ducts has increased by a factor of between one and a half and  two.    In the water of the reclaimed land on [the Dnieper's] left  bank, it is four times the admissible concentration. Over the  last year, the transfer of cesium with Prypyat River water to  the Kiev reservoir has increased approximately fivefold and of  strontium -- sevenfold. Even though the content of these  radionuclides in the drinking water of the towns of Prypyat and  Chernobyl is below the norm, it has also increased by a factor  ranging between one and a half and seven....    Incidentally, last year, just one and a half percent of the  Chernobyl fund was invested in the decontamination of the land;  this fund accounts for 12 percent of the state budget.</p>

			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / BA cabin crews to continue strikes CABIN-CREW members of the TGWU union employed by British Airways in Manchester and Birmingham said yesterday that they would press ahead with their programme of one-day strikes. They will also vote on whether to take action short of strikes. The decision, by about 500 crew, came as the airline threatened to suspend without pay any crew member who went on strike. This followed an improved offer from BA worth a total of about Pounds 1,000. Local union officials warned that action would spread to Heathrow, Gatwick, Belfast and Glasgow should the airline suspend staff. Seven flights were grounded after strikes at Birmingham and Manchester earlier this month. Crew elsewhere refrained from action, partly because 221 crew are pursuing legal actions for breach of contract against BA. The union says the airline imposed worse terms and conditions on crew without notice, and members would prefer to settle the case through the courts. BA has offered an out-of-court settlement of Pounds 425 per crew member. Under the new terms and conditions about 1,000 staff face pay cuts of Pounds 2,000 on salaries of Pounds 14,000 a year. Next year crews would receive pay rises only if inflation was above 4 per cent. The new terms follow a cost-cutting reorganisation of BA shorthaul operations. BA said it had not been notified of the planned action and stood by its new offer.</p>

			<p><P> June 12, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DARE PROGRAM  </P> <P> In my opinion DARE (Drug Abuse Resistance Education) is an absolute must in  today's society! ("DARE Survives Early Doubts: L.A. Drug Effort Takes On  International Dimensions," Part I, May 30). I do not understand how there could  be any objections to such a program.  </P> <P> Whether or not there is actual conclusive proof of a reduction in drug use is  not so much the issue. The fact is that through DARE we provide the "helping  hand" our children need to guide them in making the right choices about drugs.  It's very easy to tell a child what not to do, but what is needed is a lesson  in how to deal with certain situations involving any kind of drug, before they  arise. This is the responsibility that DARE has taken upon itself, and  recognition for a job well done is long overdue.  </P> <P> CLARA KIRSNER  </P> <P> Culver City  </P></p>

The British Indian Ocean Territory considered to be of  "outstanding international conservation importance," includes  the strategically important Diego Garcia base, the only US  nuclear base in the Indian Ocean. It failed to appear in the  Government's action plan on biodiversity last week, despite  featuring in a draft version.    The territory lies just south of the equator approximately  2,000 miles off the coast of Kenya. It was bought by Britain  from Mauritius for &pound;3 million in 1965, depopulated and  given  to the Americans for 50 years for defence purposes.    A Royal Navy detachment is also based there and Diego Garcia  was the refuelling point for American B52 bombers attacking Iraq  during the Gulf war.    The territory contains the Great Chagos Bank, the world's  largest atoll, and more than 700 species of fish and sea birds  and over 500 species of hard coral and molluscs.    Friends of the Earth is writing to the Department of the  Environment and the Foreign Office asking why no references to  the territory appeared in the UK Action Plan on Biodiversity,  issued last week as a result of UK pledges at the Earth Summit  in Rio in 1992.    A draft of the plan says: "For protection in the longer term  a comprehensive conservation policy, based on a more detailed  biodiversity inventory, is required."    Tony Juniper, of Friends of the Earth said: "The territory  is  probably one of Britain's most important assets. Its omission  from the final plan is very mysterious. The territory deserves  official recognition followed by rigorous protection."    He added: "The Diego Garcia base obviously has some role  that  is incompatible with nature conservation. But there is  restricted access and we don't know the truth about what's going  on there."    A DoE spokeswoman said considering the area's "unique  circumstances," it would not be included. "Nevertheless we take  our responsibility very seriously and legislative measures have  been implemented to protect the islands ecological system."</p>

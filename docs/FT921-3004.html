			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Pay-out held as IMI falls to Pounds 73m PRE-TAX PROFITS at IMI, one of the largest of the UK's international engineering groups, last year fell by more than a third to 1986 levels as recession caught hold of its titanium business. The outcome for the year to end-December was Pounds 73.3m, compared with Pounds 115.1m in 1990, making the second successive year of decline. Nonetheless, the board remained comfortable about the resilience of other parts of the group and recommended maintaining the dividend at 1990 levels. There is a proposed final of 5.8p, bringing total payments for the year to a same-again 10p. By contrast with Glynwed, the last leading engineering group to maintain its dividend in the face of a sharp profits fall, the payments are amply covered by earnings of 15p per share, against 23p last time. The figures were in line with expectations, and the share price drifted with the market to close 4p down at 243p. 'It was a tough year in many of the markets in which we operate,' said Mr Gary Allen, chief executive. In the coming year, IMI will depend more on the rationalisation and cost cuts it has made in the group to bring through higher profits than any economic changes. 'It is difficult to see any significant upward trend in most of the markets we serve,' said Sir Eric Pountain, chairman. IMI does not see much improvement in the UK economy until the last quarter, but will continue to invest, with capital spending exceeding the Pounds 50m spent in 1991. Last year the titanium part of the group's refined and wrought metals business faced the toughest conditions as prices and volume dropped by up to 30 per cent. As demand in the aviation industry slid away, the group's customers cut back their stocks and competitors dropped their prices. The group also lowered its prices to keep its share of the market, but nonetheless the metals business incurred a trading loss of Pounds 2m compared with a trading profit of Pounds 23.4m. Although IMI found the UK market, which accounts for 42 per cent of total group sales, difficult, its overall performance has been boosted by its companies in the US. The strength of the German market has also helped the building products division. COMMENT If it had not been for titanium, IMI would have looked in very good shape at the last year-end. Outside the metals business, its sales were slightly up, and not many engineering groups could have said that in 1991. It is protected from recession to some extent by the wide variety of its products and its markets. The only snag is that, on its own account, the market prospects for 1992 are not bright. So an increase in 1992 profits is going to depend a great deal on the benefits obtained from rationalisation already undertaken. It is realistic to look for 1992 pre-tax profits somewhere between Pounds 85m and Pounds 90m, which could give earnings per share of about 18p and put the shares on a prospective p/e of 13.5, with a much sharper increase in 1993 when the economic cycle swings IMI's way.</p>

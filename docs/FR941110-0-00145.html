			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We believe that we have implemented the Congress'  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mandate to abandon our pre-OBRA hierarchical requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and to develop a system capable of detecting and responding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to deficiencies in any participation requirement. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enforcement scheme provided in this final rule is built on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the assumption that all requirements must be met and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enforced and that requirements take on greater or lesser  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significance depending on the circumstances and resident  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> outcomes in a particular facility. In addition, we wish to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emphasize that measuring the seriousness of deficiencies is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> only for the purpose of determining the enforcement response  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> most appropriate for specific degrees of noncompliance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In order to grant the statutory flexibility given to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HCFA and the States to design their own enforcement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approaches (with guidance from the Secretary), we are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> providing a modified enforcement scheme to be used to assess  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the seriousness of deficiencies and then used to select an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enforcement response. The scheme requires that specified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> factors be considered by HCFA or the State to assess the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> seriousness of a facility's deficiencies, and it correlates  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> seriousness to specific enforcement responses. However,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the exception of the immediate jeopardy level, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enforcing agencies may exercise the flexibility to design  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their own methods of interpreting and applying the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assessment factors to the identified deficiencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Historically, determinations of immediate jeopardy to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resident health or safety have been made by HCFA and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States in accordance with guidance provided in Appendix Q of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the State Operations Manual. We conclude that there is no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compelling reason for States to redefine this level of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> noncompliance. The enforcing agencies may also exercise  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their statutory authority to determine whether an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternative remedy is or is not preferable to termination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In determining the seriousness of Life Safety Code (LSC)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deficiencies, States are encouraged to apply the Fire Safety  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Evaluation System (FSES), which is Appendix C of the 1985  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> edition of the LSC. Since the FSES is an equivalency system  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> based on point values, it is possible to utilize the system  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to document the seriousness of deficiencies on a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quantitative basis in accordance with the revised  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enforcement matrix. Once the seriousness of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deficiencies is determined and the decision to impose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternative remedies instead of, or in addition to,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> termination, HCFA or the State must make its remedy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> selection from the remedy category associated with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specific level of noncompliance. This correlation is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provided in &sect;488.408 of this final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This approach has the added benefit of promoting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> national consistency because all systems will be considering  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the same initial assessment factors, and the remedy choice  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will then be based on the nature of the noncompliance and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the corrective action most likely to achieve correction and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> continued compliance. In other words, we developed, for use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by the States and by HCFA, an organized and consistent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> method by which to first, determine how serious a facility's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deficiencies are, and second, to select an enforcement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> response from a specified remedy category linked to that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> degree of noncompliance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We believe that the enforcement scheme we are providing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in this final rule for HCFA and the States to use in rating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deficiencies and selecting remedies satisfies a variety of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concerns posed by the former scope and severity scale and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the proposed rule in general. Under the proposed rule, we  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> set out two scales, one for scope and one for severity, that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HCFA and the States were to apply in determining which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remedy to apply once deficiencies were identified. While  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the rule provided some definition for each of the levels of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scope and severity, HCFA and the States were essentially  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> free to determine what constituted a ``sufficient'' number of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``repeated observations'' in concluding whether or not a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``pattern'' of deficiencies could be said to exist.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the final rule, we have removed the scope and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> severity scales, as such, and have replaced them with a set  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of criteria that must be used (should a decision be made to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impose alternative remedies at all) to select an enforcement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remedy. Specifically, while the enforcement scheme in this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> final rule is conceptually the same as the former scope and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> severity scales, it differs from that approach in numerous  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significant ways:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;It leaves to the judgment of both HCFA and the States  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whether to impose alternative remedies at all, regardless of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the seriousness of a facility's deficiencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;It incorporates the concept of substantial compliance,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whereby deficiencies found which constitute no more than a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> potential for minimal harm are not sanctioned.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;With the exception of immediate jeopardy, a State may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use its own method for interpreting terms that describe the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relative frequency or seriousness of deficiencies as long as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> it is consistent with the guidance presented in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

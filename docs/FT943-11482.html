			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia): Nikkei recovers the 20,000 level on late buying Tokyo Dealers braced themselves for a sharp decline in share prices as the Nikkei 225 average fell through the 20,000 level in the morning session, but the index closed higher on buying by arbitrageurs and domestic institutions, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. It was finally 110.62 ahead at 20,247.85 after dipping to 19,993.70 in the morning and setting a day's peak of 20,262.55 just before the close. Foreign investors took profits on blue chip exporters, while dealers sold to adjust their positions, pushing the index below 20,000 for the first time since May 18. Domestic institutions, along with public funds, later supported the index, restoring investor con-fidence. Volume, however, remained low at 291.6m shares against 277m. The Topix index of all first section stocks put on 5.64 at 1,621.46 and the Nikkei 300 firmed 1.52 to 294.33. Falls outnumbered rises by 544 to 428, with 183 issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index edged forward 0.82 to 1,312.70. Some electrical issues, which met selling in the morning, recovered in the afternoon. Toshiba, the day's most active stock, rose Y5 to Y727 and Fujitsu gained Y20 at Y1,040. Others remained weak, Hitachi slipping Y7 to Y952 and Matsushita Electric Industrial shedding Y30 to Y1,630. Brokers continued to lose ground: Nomura Securities shed Y30 to Y2,190 and Daiwa Securities Y40 to Y1,540. Banks, however, were higher on arbitrage buying, Industrial Bank of Japan appreciating Y20 to Y3,010 and Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank moving up Y50 to Y1,860. Speculators bought Ihara Chemical Industry, which advanced Y90 to Y1,300 in spite of the absence of any conspicuous news, while Mitsubishi Oil added Y10 at Y1,160. Large-capital steels and shipbuilders closed firmer on buying by domestic institutions. Nippon Steel moved forward Y4 to Y334 and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Y4 to Y770. Mining shares were higher, with Sumitomo Metal Mining ahead Y9 at Y924 and Dowa Mining gaining Y2 at Y575. In Osaka, the OSE average rose 3.41 to 22,498.81 in volume of 20.4m shares. The index improved for the first time in six trading days as buying by domestic institutions countered selling by overseas and individual investors. Roundup An early gain in Hong Kong, lost by the close, supported many of the region's markets, but turnover was generally low. Local investors in China, meanwhile, turned nervous. HONG KONG closed flat after a volatile day as profit-takers erased all of an earlier 140-point rise. The Hang Seng index finished just 0.48 ahead at 9,402.66 after touching the day's high of 9,541.63 in the morning on the strength of property issues. Strong demand by foreign funds lifted the day's turnover to HKDollars 6.28bn from HKDollars 4.54bn. Among property shares, Cheung Kong was up a net 10 cents at HKDollars 37.30 after a day's peak of HKDollars 38.20. Sun Hung Kai Properties advanced 40 cents to HKDollars 49.60. HSBC Holdings, HKDollars 1.50 higher in early trade, finished unchanged at HKDollars 91.75. SHANGHAI's A share index crashed 9.2 per cent to a record low as investors, resigned to further declines, embarked on a round of selling. The index lost 33.92 at 336.22, for a two-day fall of 13.7 per cent. The Shanghai exchange was officially launched in December 1990, but the index did not become a meaningful indicator until much later. Official newspapers put the previous record low close at 362.46 on November 17, 1992. The index has plummeted by 79.5 per cent since its high of 1,640.71 was set on February 16 last year, affected by a national credit clampdown, rising bank interest rates and the success of this year's government bond issue. Shanghai's B share index, however, gained as a result of a slight strengthening in Hong Kong's stock market, putting on 1.4 per cent at 68.39. In Shenzhen, the A index also closed at an all-time low, falling 5.5 per cent, but the B index gained 0.4 per cent. BOMBAY ended slightly firmer after a dull session during which cement and a few cash issues were the only ones actively traded. The BSE 30-share index hardened 5.70 to 4,106.97. Shares in Gujarat Ambuja Cement led the rally in cement stocks, rising by 9 per cent before falling back slightly. Gujarat Ambuja's shares recorded a year's high when touching Rs720, later slipping to Rs700, still Rs40 stronger on the day. TAIPEI eased in a slow trading session as the market continued its period of consolidation after recent strength. The weighted index receded 19.21 to 6,642.13 in turnover of TDollars 94.08bn. Among the most impressive performers, Taiwan Styrene Monomer, a major petrochemical manufacturer, advanced by the daily 7 per cent limit to TDollars 87.00. Brokers said the turnround in the plastics sector would continue to support prices in the near term because international demand for petrochemicals was still high. MANILA was another market to move only marginally higher as investors were encouraged by gains elsewhere in the region. The composite index was ahead 6.54 points at 2,791.14 after an intraday high of 2,813. Turnover came to 1.2bn pesos. San Miguel, which reported a 40 per cent increase in its first-half net profits, slipped on profit-taking: the 'B' shares lost 1 peso at 134 pesos. SYDNEY rose in quiet trade, led by gains in blue chips. The All Ordinaries index firmed 0.4 to 2,042.1. Turnover amounted to ADollars 544.1m. BHP added 2 cents at ADollars 18.70 and News Corp gained 3 cents at ADollars 8.49. TNT remained well supported on optimism of a turnround in its European operations, climbing 9 cents to ADollars 2.69. KUALA LUMPUR saw strong institutional and retail buying during the afternoon which took the market higher for the fifth straight day. The composite index added 6.11 at 1,026.30. Idris led the day's activity, rising 18 cents to MDollars 4.84 in response to its plans to buy a 30 per cent stake in Aokam's plywood mill. Time Engineering and Landmarks gained on news that they will be part of a consortium which has won the licence for a new electricity plant. Time rose 70 cents to MDollars 8.05 and Landmarks put on 16 cents at MDollars 5.10. BANGKOK encountered late profit-taking after Wednesday's rally, pulling the SET index back from its best level to close 3.69 ahead at 1,371.33. Foreign institutional demand pushed turnover up to Bt11.66bn from the previous Bt6bn. SEOUL was lower for the fourth session in a row in the absence of fresh factors to drive the market. The composite index declined 8.02 to 926.20. WELLINGTON was led down by Telecom during another day of slow trade. The NZSE-40 capital index ended 17.97 off at 2,008.95 in turnover of NZDollars 39m. Telecom retreated 12 cents to NZDollars 4.68.</p>

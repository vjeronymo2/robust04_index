			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Pekka Vaisanen: "SMP May Lose Representation in </F> Parliament"]    [Excerpts] The Rural Party's long continuing decline  speeded up last week when the party's favorite and presidential  candidate Sulo Aittoniemi quit the party's parliamentary  delegation [to join the Center Party group]. The party garnered  only 1.4 percent in the Gallup poll published by HELSINGIN  SANOMAT on Saturday [26 March]. The SMP [Finnish Rural Party]  could be swept out of parliament in the next election.    There are several reasons for SMP's decline. In the views of  many the party has argued itself into the ground. This is  denied, however, in a statement released on Sunday by Party  Secretary Timo Soini.    "An attempt is being made to destroy the SMP," Soini  asserted  in his news release.    "Our parliamentary delegation has been thrown into disarray  especially by money. There is no one who has not been selling  out," Soini stated. He saw the biggest scapegoats outside of  SMP, but also saw that the SMP "has to clean up its own house.  There must be no room for those who threaten and gamble."  <H5>  Parliamentary Representatives in Difficulty </H5>   The party's prospects in the 1995 elections seem dismal.  Only  SMP Chairman Rimo Vistbacka is starting from a moderately  favorable position for the parliamentary elections. He has had  solid support from Pohjanmaa voters since 1987. Chances of  continuing in parliament for most other SMP representatives are  for differing reasons hanging in the balance. [passage omitted]  <H5>  "Everything Adrift" </H5>   The SMP is entering the election campaign in poor condition  in other respects also. The Justice Ministry has handed over the  party's economic backbone, the SMP Support Foundation, to  court-appointed trustees.    The party's debts amount to 3-4 million markkas. Secured  loans are still being found. On the other hand, the party's  newspaper publishing company is in continuous economic  difficulty. [passage omitted]    Soini described the party's situation as "everything  adrift."  Matters are not being taken care of by anyone. Vistback is  overcautious, does not dare to make decisions, does not take a  stand, nor bang his fist on the table. [passage omitted]    Other parties consider the SMP an outcast. It is only to be  accepted as a campaign alliance partner in extreme emergency.  For example, campaign alliance master SKL [Finnish Christian  Party] takes the SMP along where the Center Party does not care  to join in alliance. [passage omitted]    The SMP may find itself in an extraordinary situation at the  party convention this June in Tampere: it cannot be ruled out  that there will be no seriously acceptable candidates for party  leadership posts, or even any challengers to the present  leaders.

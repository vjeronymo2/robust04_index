			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by K. Venizelos] </F>   [Excerpt] In his recent meeting with President Bill  Clinton, Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou raised  President Glavkos Kliridhis' proposal to demilitarize Cyprus.  According to informed sources, Papandreou did raise the Cypriot  president's proposal but the U.S. side appears to insist on  reaching an agreement for the confidence-building measures  [CBM's]. President Clinton described the demilitarization  proposal as "good" but untimely.    This fact creates the reasonable impression that the  Americans will not renege on their efforts for an agreement on  the CBM's, something that is also strengthened by reports that  the Americans avoid discussing any alternate proposals such as  those made by the Cypriot Government. Joe Clark's visit to the  area is also linked with the UN intention to proceed with  changes to the package. [passage omitted]</p>

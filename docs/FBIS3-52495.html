			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Seventh Round and After"] </F>   [Text] The seventh round of India-Pakistan talks,  notwithstanding inclusion of Kashmir as a separate agenda, has  been, to say the least, a non-starter. When he arrived in  Islamabad to renew the Foreign Secretaries talks exercise, J.N.  Dixit was all smiles and, for a change, willing to acknowledge  Kashmir as a disputed territory. He especially flew to Karachi  to meet the Prime Minister as if he was on a mission of serious  business. But, what has actually transpired at the negotiations  table is a reaffirmation of the view that there has been no real  change in New Delhi's stance on Kashmir, and the offer to have  talks on Kashmir was basically a ploy to hoodwink world opinion.  `We told you so', the Opposition would say, and persist in  accusing the government of `miscalculation' and `mismanagement'.  And the government will have to reckon with the charge that we  have let the Indians get off the hook by acquiescing in the  farce of Kashmir talks, more so because Islamabad had called off  its initiative at the UN to facilitate the holding of the  seventh round. Not that the Foreign Office had raised any false  hopes about a breakthrough, notwithstanding the Prime Minister's  comment that New Delhi's willingness to discuss Kashmir was a  `significant development'. It had, on the contrary, made it  quite clear that it did not expect the Indians to depart from  their official position to make any major concessions on  Kashmir. The outcome of the seventh round has thus been what was  being anticipated in Islamabad. Nevertheless, what calls for a  convincing explanation is whether or not the hasty decision to  hold back the UN resolution on human rights violations in IHK  was worth the `dirty game' the Indians have played on us on the  pretense of accepting Kashmir as a disputed territory.    Where do we go now from the debacle of bilateral approach to  the Kashmir dispute, is the question that needs to be address by  the government. We are told by the Foreign Office that it was  necessary to go through the drill of talks on Kashmir to  convince our friends abroad that we were willing to negotiate  with India all the outstanding disputes. But, the Indians,  being past masters of running international propaganda  campaigns, are not likely to miss the opportunity to hold  Pakistan responsible for the deadlock. In any case they have  been successful in creating confusion and misgivings in the name  of bilateral talks, in the ranks of freedom fighters. Islamabad  has clearly brought the message home that no talks at the  Foreign Secretaries, or any other level, will be scheduled  unless there is a visible de-escalation of oppression let loose  by the Indians in the Kashmir Valley. It is admittedly a  principled stand, and should dispel the Opposition's  apprehension that there may have been a sell-out on Kashmir.  Refusal to delink other outstanding problems from the `core  issue' has demonstrated that the government is not prone to  buying the so-called `step by step diplomacy' at the cost of  consigning the Kashmir question to limbo. What has emerged as an  imperative of ground reality is to renew, with all the resources  at our command, a concerted bid to internationalise the Kashmir  question, no matter how annoying it may be to New Delhi.</p>

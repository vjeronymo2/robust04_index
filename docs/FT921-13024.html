			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / Arts: Painting Churches - The Playhouse It seems to be America week in the London theatre. After the revival of Arthur Miller's All My Sons at the Young Vic now comes Tina Howe's Painting Churches at the Playhouse. Ms Howe is a playwright who specialises in extravagant settings. One of her plays which I like is set in a major American museum of modern art and is duly called Museum. Another, The Art of Dining, is set in a restaurant while her Coastal Disturbances takes place on a beach with the ocean heaving in the background. Painting Churches is thus a deliberately teasing title, given Ms Howe's other works. The Churches are a Boston family, not ecclesiastical buildings. The painting is a portrait of her parents, done by their daughter, Margaret. The author admits in a programme note that the piece is ever so slightly autobiographical. It is certainly sentimental, but that is a characteristic of so much American theatre and not even All My Sons, for all its other virtues, is entirely free of it. Gardner Church is a poet who knew Pound and Frost and Andre Malraux. He has now run dry and gone slightly gaga. He is married to a rich Bostonian, but believing that you should never dip into capital, the couple are preparing to move to their Cape Cod house for good. The daughter turns up to help on condition that she can paint them for her New York exhibition. The dialogue between the parents recalls for me a famous New Yorker cartoon of an elderly couple sitting in a restaurant looking at the menu and one of them saying to the other: 'Darling, remind me, which one of us doesn't like caviar?' That remark is not without affection or style and is broadly how the Churches talk to each other. Fanny is trying, in her own words, to 'exit with a little flourish' while still looking after her husband. Clearly the couple had great style once. When asked to sit for the portrait, they pose successively as Grant Wood's American Gothic and Michelangelo's Pieta and The Creation. (Ms Howe is very good in dealing with art, as Museum showed.) Finally they sit in black tie and the female equivalent. At the end the portrait is never shown to the audience. Instead we see the couple watching its unveiling, Fanny hostile at first, then beginning to like it. 'You know what it is?' she says. 'The wispy brush strokes make us look like a couple in a French Impressionist painting.' They begin slowly to waltz. Margaret is pleased that she has impressed her parents at last. There is also a parakeet who recites bits from Gray's Elegy, apparently a genuine bit of autobiography. I rather liked the mild mixture of wit and poignancy, but have to admit that many people will find the New England style rather slow. There is not much that the director, Patrick Sandford of the Nuffield Theatre, Southampton, nor the cast of Leslie and Sian Phillips and Joise Lawrence can do to speed it up. It is like the Elegy with a touch of the New Yorker thrown in.</p>

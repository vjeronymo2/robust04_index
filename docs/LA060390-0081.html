			<p><P> June 3, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNISTS IN EAST GERMANY STAGE PROTEST  </P> <P> Tens of thousands of Communist supporters rallied in the East German capital  Saturday to protest the government's decision to take control of the ousted  party's vast holdings.  </P> <P> The protesters rallied in a park to denounce what they called the "fascist"  action of the democratic leadership.  </P> <P> "First, PDS banned. Second, books burned. Third, Auschwitz?" read a banner at  the rally, seeking to compare the government to Hitler's Nazi regime.  </P> <P> PDS stands for the Party of Democratic Socialism, the reconstituted Communist  Party that lost power last year.  </P> <P> The government news agency ADN estimated the crowd at about 65,000 people.  </P> <P> The protesters were angry about the decision by Parliament on Thursday to put  the vast holdings of the defunct Communist Party in trust pending an  investigation by an independent commission of their value and ownership.  </P> <P> The former Communists amassed millions, perhaps billions, of dollars in houses,  businesses and property during their four decades in power.  </P> <P> Lawmaker Gregor Gysi, leader of the former Communist faction that holds 66  seats in the 400-member Parliament, has accused the government of seeking to  eliminate his party by seizing its assets.  </P></p>

			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / Government Bonds: Italy rallies despite political uncertainty Italian government bonds rallied yesterday, in spite of continuing political uncertainty. The March bond futures contract on Liffe climbed by 0.62 to reach 99.52, while in the cash market the yield spread over bunds narrowed by 11 basis points to 477. The uplift was due to short covering by domestic traders, said analysts. In spite of a combative defence of his government by prime minister Mr Silvio Berlusconi yesterday, the markets still see a new administration as inevitable. 'All the bad news has been factored in,' said Mr Adrian James, European bond strategist at NatWest Markets. In the longer term, overseas investors are likely to remain underweight until more effective action is taken to tackle fiscal problems. Although some analysts say technical resistance will prevent the yield spread widening above 500 basis points over the bund, this view is not shared by all observers. Mr Giorgio Radaelli, senior economist with Lehman Brothers International, says early elections - conducted under present constitutional arrangements - would be the worst outcome, prolonging political uncertainty. German bonds ended a quiet session broadly unchanged, with the March bund futures contract on Liffe ending around 89.70, up 0.01 point. Most dealers were not expecting any surprise announcements from today's meeting of the Bundesbank's central bank council. The central bank is due to announce its M3 money supply growth target for next year, and most dealers expect it to stick to its current 4-6 per cent range. UK gilts ended a slow day little changed, though slightly outperforming Germany which caused the 10-year yield gap over bunds to narrow by two basis points to 112 basis points. Volume was thin and dealers reported little activity. French bonds continued their recent weakness, led again by the short end of the yield curve as the French franc continued to weaken against the D-Mark. With the franc trading outside its former narrow exchange rate mechanism band, dealers are wondering what the central bank will do to defend the currency. Spanish bonds came under pressure from currency weakness, political troubles and fears that the Bank of Spain - which gains full policy independence next year - will raise rates sooner than previously expected. The Spanish 10-year bond future fell by 0.23 point to 84.91. US Treasury prices were mixed yesterday after moderate demand at an afternoon auction of two-year notes. Late in the session the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  1/8 at 96 1/16 yielding 7.837 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year note was down  1/16 at 99 13/16 , yielding 7.563 per cent. The modest decrease at the short end of the market was due in part to traders short selling those securities amid speculation that prices - which have bounced back this week from their lows earlier this month - would drop with another monetary tightening. The Federal Reserve's failure to raise rates at Tuesday's meeting of its open market committee lifted the prices at the short end, causing the curve mapping the relation of yields on two-year and 30-year bonds to steepen despite an overall flattening trend. A flattening curve generally indicates that the market expects an economic slowdown. Few economists, however expected the steepness to hold because of the widespread belief that the Fed will raise interest rates again shortly after the start of the new year. Modest but not overwhelming demand was shown at an afternoon auction in which the Treasury sold Dollars 17.25bn of two-year notes. This afternoon the Treasury is to offer Dollars 11bn in five-year notes.</p>

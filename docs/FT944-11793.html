			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / 'Family-friendly' companies spread An increasing number of British companies are adopting family-friendly, flexible working policies although not many employees are taking advantage of them, Lady Howe, chairwoman of the business-led initiative Opportunity 2000, said yesterday. Lady Howe said on the campaign's third anniversary: 'The provision of progressive policies such as maternity and paternity leave, job sharing and part-time work have grown significantly over the past year.' But Lady Howe said that the take-up of many of these policies was still very low and the increasing prevalence of a 'working all hours' culture made it difficult for people to curtail their work habits to take care of their families. A report on a survey of 187 Opportunity 2000 members found that job-share arrangements were used by less than 10 per cent of eligible women in 88 per cent of businesses. In nearly a quarter of the organisations responding, maternity provision beyond the statutory requirement was taken up by less than 10 per cent of eligible women. However, Opportunity 2000's 275 members, which come from most sectors of the market and employ more than 25 per cent of the UK workforce, are improving management prospects for women. An average of 25 per cent of managerial positions in these companies are held by women. This compares with estimates from the Institute of Management, which put the figure as low as 9.5 per cent for top companies as a whole.</p>

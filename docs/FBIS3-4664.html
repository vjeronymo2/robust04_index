			<p>Language: <F P=105> Cambodian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Article": "The Presence of Nearly Four Million Vietnamese </F> Settlers in Cambodia Must Not Be Legalized; All Vietnamese  Settlers Must Be Gathered in Camps and Sent Back to Vietnam"]    [Text] Puppet Chea Sim, the out-and-out lackey of the  Vietnamese communists, will soon go to Hanoi according to a  report from a group of National Assembly members. The report  added that in this trip to Hanoi, puppet Chea Sim will seek  approval for a draft immigration law from the Vietnamese  communists before presenting it to the two-headed government and  puppet National Assembly for endorsement into law.    It should be recalled that during his visit to Phnom Penh  from 16 to 18 February, Vietnamese Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh  Cam instructed the two-headed government and his puppets to  draft an immigration law to legalize the presence of nearly four  million Vietnamese settlers in Cambodia.    The issue of Vietnamese settlers in Cambodia is a national  problem linked to the survival of the entire Cambodian nation  and people and of every Cambodian and family. Since 1979,  Vietnamese settlers kept flowing into Cambodia at will with the  permission of the Vietnamese puppet administration to serve as a  prop for the hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese aggressor  troops.    After the signing of the Paris agreement in October 1991,  Vietnamese settlers came to Cambodia through UNTAC [UN  Transitional Authority in Cambodia] and all the Vietnamese  puppet administrative networks maintained by UNTAC. After the  UNTAC-organized elections, more Vietnamese settlers continued to  flow into Cambodia through the two-headed government of which  ninty-nine percent of the Phnom Penh-based power and 100-percent  power in the provinces, districts, communes, and villages are in  the hands of the Vietnamese communists' puppet administration.    The issue of Vietnamese settlers must be resolved in  accordance with international law, which clearly states the  status of foreign settlers entering other countries during a war  of aggression, and according to the rules and regulations  applied and being applied in various countries, such as Hong  Kong and some other countries in this region. That is, all  Vietnamese settlers must be gathered in concentration camps and  then repatriated in an orderly manner.    The two-headed government must be held fully responsible for  the Cambodian nation, people, and history in approving the  presence of Vietnamese settlers in Cambodia, thus enabling them  to turn Cambodia into a second Kampuchea Kraom through legal  means.</p>

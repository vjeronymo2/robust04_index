			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Region mixed as Nikkei falls 0.8% in low turnover Shares lost some ground in thin conditions as investors held back from trading ahead of the three-day holiday, which begins today. The sharp rise in the yen provided a further disincentive, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei 225 index fell 155.04, or 0.8 per cent, to 19,570.21 after a high of 19,648.53 and a low of 19,488.90. Arbitrage trading depressed prices, but late overseas demand eroded some of the earlier losses. Volume totaled 130m shares against 217m. Some analysts said that the rise in the yen, which reached an eight-month high against the dollar, had already been discounted into stock prices following the inauguration of Mr Tsutomu Hata's minority government. Investors, however, said that the rise had increased the risk of committing funds to the stock market. 'With the price to earnings ratio at 100 and the yen at these levels, people have started to realise that their initial forecasts for the market were a little optimistic,' said an official at Nippon Life, the largest life assurer. He said the Nikkei index could fall to as low as 18,000 in the near term. The recent volatility of the yen was seen as a threat to the earnings recovery expected during the second half of the year. Some traders feared that overseas investors, who had bought Japanese stocks during the first quarter, might start to take profits as the yen's appreciation pushed up the value of their portfolios. The Topix index of all first section stocks fell 9.85 to 1,593.48 while the Nikkei 300 lost 1.85 to 291.25. Losers led gainers by 736 to 223, with 157 issues remaining unchanged. High-technology stocks lost ground on profit-taking. Hitachi fell Y9 to Y951 and Fujitsu lost Y20 to Y1,000. Large-capital stocks were also sold, with Nippon Steel down Y3 to Y344 and Mitsubishi Heavy losing Y1 to Y674. Arbitrage selling depressed some banking stocks. Industrial Bank of Japan fell Y10 to Y3,150 and Dai-ichi Kangyo Bank declined Y20 to Y1,880. Speculative shares were picked up by individual investors looking for quick profits. Brother Industries, the most active issue of the day, rose Y27 to Y665. In Osaka, the OSE average fell 125.94 to 21,892.55 in volume of 32.3m shares. Roundup The region offered a study in contrasts, with its biggest equity markets depressed in thin trade but Manila and Seoul in upbeat mood. Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Bangkok and Colombo were closed for holidays. HONG KONG dropped 1.9 per cent in thin trade amid uncertainty over interest rates, the Hang Seng index closing 166.37 lower at 8,799.70 after futures-led selling emerged in the afternoon. Turnover fell from HKDollars 3.11bn to HKDollars 2.38bn, property shares continuing to slide on newspaper reports of a softening in the real estate market, the sector index falling 393.03, or 2.55 per cent to 15,012.47. SHK Properties tumbled HKDollars 1.50 to HKDollars 45.00, and Cheung Kong HKDollars 1.00 to HKDollars 35.50. AUSTRALIA saw turnover hit a seven-month low as the All Ordinaries index fell 18.2 to 2,047.9. Volume was 128.2m shares valued at ADollars 253.9m. Southcorp shares were suspended after tumbling 17 cents to ADollars 3.14, pending an announcement. The company later announced the resignation of its managing director, Mr Ross Wilson. A sharp fall by Samantha Gold dragged the golds index down by nearly 2 per cent, Samantha losing 80 cents, or 14.3 per cent, to ADollars 4.80 following news that reserves at its Chalice prospect have been downgraded. NEW ZEALAND fell mostly on a 7 cent decline in Telecom as local and international support for leading issues failed to materialise. The NZSE-40 index fell 14.06 to 2,096.15 although the broader market fared better, the small companies index gaining 11.37 to 4,672.45. KARACHI fell in dull trade with dealers reluctant to enter the market amid widespread disturbances in the city. The KSE 100 slipped 25.01 to 2,377.31. BOMBAY recovered slightly towards the close on buying by Indian mutual funds. The BSE 30-share index ended 0.72 higher at 3,746.19. Turnover stayed low, depressed by the mid-March ban on forward trading imposed by the Securities and Exchange Board of India. MANILA rose on expectations of strong first quarter Philippine economic growth. The composite index closed 41.22 higher at 2,885.44, also boosted by a 5 peso rise to 176 pesos in San Miguel A shares on speculation that the company would convert its Hong Kong brewery into a high-class residential development. Turnover, however, fell from 987.6m pesos to 697.8m. SEOUL did big business on institutional buying of medium-priced blue chips, the composite stock index closing 10.54 higher at 919.26. Turnover was Won1,001bn, representing the highest volume of trading since March 17. TAIWAN's weighted index rose 40.13 to 5,777.48 in thin trade. Interest was seen in selected industrials, late buying in financials.</p>

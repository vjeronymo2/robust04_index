			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / Iran bans satellite dishes Iran has banned satellite dishes used by thousands of people to watch foreign TV programmes, Reuter reports from Tehran. The cabinet has instructed the Interior Ministry to implement the ban within two months, the daily newspaper Salam quoted Mr Ali Mohammad Besharati, interior minister, as saying. Satellite dishes began sprouting on rooftops two years ago. Salam reported last month that 400 dishes were being installed daily in Tehran despite warnings that foreign TV programmes were part of a western 'offensive' to corrupt Iranians.</p>

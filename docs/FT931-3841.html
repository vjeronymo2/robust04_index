			<p>930313 FT  13 MAR 93 / International Company News: Fujitsu forecasts Y20bn loss FUJITSU, Japan's largest computer maker and number two in the world rankings, expects to post a pre-tax loss this year, the first since the group was listed on the Tokyo stock exchange in 1949. Fujitsu, which owns ICL, the UK computer company, yesterday said the unexpected length of Japan's economic slowdown would leave the group with a pre-tax loss on a consolidated basis of Y20bn (Dollars 159.2m) for the year ending March, 1993. This reverses an earlier Fujitsu forecast of a Y30bn profit. The Japanese computer group, which emulated and strove to surpass IBM, the US computer group, will end up following its fiercest rival into the red. Fujitsu says it will pay a final dividend of Y3 a share and not the Y5 forecast. Consolidated revenues, which were forecast in October to be Y3,600bn would instead be Y150bn less at Y3,400bn. However, ICL was expected to make a profit, Fujitsu said. Fujitsu said that the profit revision comes as a result of the sharp fall in demand for computers and in profit margins from computers. While markets worldwide have been affected by the slump in corporate investment, the Japanese computer market, in particular, has been hit by cuts in capital investment by corporations and financial institutions. While computer companies normally expect a burst of demand from customers just before the closing of books in March, this year that demand did not materialise, the group said. The Japanese computer market in the past five months has been disrupted by price cuts, which have eaten into the profit margins of computer manufacturers. Of the Y90bn difference between Fujitsu's profits forecast in October and its latest forecast, Y75bn relates to its computer business, Y5bn to electronic devices and Y10bn to communications equipment, Fujitsu said. Fujitsu has a heavy financial burden after its purchase of ICL for Pounds 700m and recent expansion of its semiconductor manufacturing capacity in the UK. The group announced earlier this week that it would reduce graduate intake next year to 300 people, compared with 2,200 this year and nearly 4,000 in 1989. Capital spending is expected to remain at this year's level while R&amp;D expenditure is gradually reduced.</p>

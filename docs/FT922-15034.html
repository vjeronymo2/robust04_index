			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / UK Company News: Exceptional forces DC Gardner to Pounds 3.8m loss DC GARDNER Group, the management consultancy and business services company, incurred a loss of Pounds 3.76m, including an exceptional Pounds 3.34m, for 1991. The previous year saw a profit of Pounds 2.11m. However, ACT Chart, the accountancy training division, was sold at the end of December for Pounds 7m, including related debt, and this, together with Pounds 4.1m net from the July rights issue, cut group borrowings to Pounds 3.8m (Pounds 12.6m) by the year-end. This gave gearing of 40 per cent. The restructuring helped continuing activities to show a turnround from a loss before tax and exceptional items of Pounds 211,000 in the first half to profits of Pounds 547,000 in the second six months. Total turnover was Pounds 27.1m (Pounds 23.7m) with Pounds 9.04m attributable to discontinued activities. The company has insufficient distributable reserves to pay a dividend (3.89p). In order to facilitate the resumption of dividend payments in 1992, the board is to apply to the court for approval of a reduction in the share premium account. Losses per share amounted to 18.3p (earnings of 8p). The group has made a good start to the current year with Coutts, the outplacement and career management subsidiary, achieving record results in the first quarter. Also the recent award of important new contracts are providing a stream of profitable new business through the rest of 1992.</p>

			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / FT Exporter (32): The strategy of a hidden persuader - Michael Rowe looks at France's leading inspection company which, although it rarely makes the headlines, is now moving upstream from certifying ships to handling risk control at the design stage / Bureau Veritas France's leading inspection company, Bureau Veritas, is one of those discreetly private organisations that rarely, if ever, make the headlines. Seventy per cent of its equity is still in the hands of the families that founded the company in 1828 and the remainder is held by French financial institutions and members of staff. No single spectacular project marks the bureau's widening business portfolio. Even its low-rise head office in the modern Parisian business district of La Defense is shielded from too much direct view by the glass-sided tower blocks that surround it. Originally created as a certifying agency for new ships - an activity that still accounts for 26 per cent of total turnover - Bureau Veritas is today diversifying into areas such as the certification of corporate quality assurance systems and civil and environmental engineering. Exporters and importers especially know the Veritas name because the company carries out pre-shipment inspections for half a dozen governments in Africa and Latin America, as well as inspecting export merchandise for private sector customers. 'At first sight what we do looks like a very mixed bag of tricks, but in fact throughout our operations we exercise the same basic central task. This is to anticipate and limit business risks by checking and helping to improve quality and security,' says Gerard Coffinet, executive vice-president and chief executive for France of Bureau Veritas. The Bureau Veritas Group employs about 5,000 staff and maintains more than 500 offices in around 100 different countries. France accounts for more than a quarter of this total, with the rest of Europe contributing roughly the same percentage. Some of the group's activities, particularly supervision of public works and construction projects, are centred on the local French market. Most of the rest are increasingly international. In 1992 - the most recent year for which figures are available - net post-tax profits for the group came to FFr48.8m (Pounds 5.6m) on a total turnover of FFr1.7bn (Pounds 197.6m). Fourteen per cent of 1992 sales revenues are derived from the commodities and international trade sector, 29 per cent from civil and environmental engineering, 21 per cent from the industrial sector and 10 per cent from aeronautics and space. 'Our strategy is not to be number one in terms of size, but to strive to maintain the highest standards of quality in our work and gain an international reputation for offering the most reliable services in our sectors of activity. This reputation is our main capital,' says Mr Coffinet. 'In our line of work it is particularly important to be - and to appear clearly to be - independent. Partly for this reason, our different sectoral activities are split off into separate operating subsidiaries,' he says. 'We are also helped in this respect by the fact that, because of the nature of our work, we have no dominant client who could exert pressure on our decision making processes.' International trade provides one of the fastest growing areas of activity for Bureau Veritas, second only to the industrial sector. In 1992, for example, sales volumes for the former increased by 9.3 per cent over the total for the previous year. Moreover, within this sector a specialised subsidiary called Bivac International handles import supervision programmes on behalf of client governments. At present, Bureau Veritas has such contracts with the governments of Nigeria, Kenya, Madagascar, Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Peru. Recently, it obtained a contract from Mexico. 'In view of the risk situations involved, including political and payment risks, we would not want the percentage of our total turnover earned from this activity to rise much above, say, 15 per cent,' says Gilles Minard, chairman and president of Bivac International. This means increasing turnover in other fields rather than restricting import supervision work. 'Our basic objective under import supervisory contracts is to ensure that goods are in accordance with the stipulated quality and quantity specifications and that the price falls within normal parameters,' says Mr Minard. At the same time, Veritas is trying to extend its service into related areas by providing developing country customs authorities with technical assistance to secure customs receipts. Madagascar provides one example of this approach. 'Contrary to the suspicions of some exporters, our import supervision fees are based solely on the contract value of the goods, and we are not paid a percentage of any price reductions that may be obtained as a result of our checking procedures,' Mr Minard says. 'I can understand why some companies dislike this procedure, since it makes it difficult for them to charge different prices in different markets as a matter of commercial policy rather than on the basis of objective cost differences. 'At the same time, I would say that as a result of the growing use of import supervision programmes since the 1970s, cases of outright export frauds against developing countries have become much rarer. Today, one of the main problems is the tendency of manufacturers and sellers in industrialised countries to get rid of products that no longer comply with increasingly stringent local safety and environmental regulations by dumping them in the third world,' Mr Minard says. An important strand in Bureau Veritas's overall strategy in recent years has been to move upstream from inspection of finished products to handling risk control at the design stage. One example is the group's British subsidiary, BVQI. This certifies corporate quality systems in accordance with the so-called international ISO 9000 standard. 'In this area we do not inspect the product. We certify the quality of the company's procedures,' says Mr Coffinet.</p>

			<p>930628 FT  28 JUN 93 / Concorde returns after interior refit BRITISH Airways has beaten Air France in the refurbishment of their supersonic aircraft, Concorde. The first of British Airways' seven Concordes emerged during the weekend with a complete interior refit. Work on the last should finish next spring. The investment of about Pounds 1m per aircraft was prompted by passengers who complained of Concorde's dated image. The aircraft have been in service since 1976. Air France is also in the midst of improving its five Concordes. Details should be revealed by early autumn.</p>

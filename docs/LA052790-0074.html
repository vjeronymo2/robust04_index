			<p><P> May 27, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO AMERICA'S CUP RUNNETH OVER WITH DEBT;  </P> <P> SPORT: THREE YEARS AGO, A YACHTING REGATTA SOUNDED LIKE A GREAT IDEA. TODAY,  THE CITY AND COUNTY CANNOT AFFORD THE PRICE OF GLORY ON THE SEAS.  </P> <P> Yachting's prized racing trophy, the America's Cup, at last came home to San  Diego this month, won not in honorable combat on the waves, as is tradition,  but in a stuffy New York courtroom. After a particularly dismal cup event in  1988, and 18 months of tacking through a legal storm, the trophy returns  tarnished in spirit and metal, and still facing an uncertain future.  </P> <P> Noticeably absent from its homecoming was the enthusiasm that greeted the  America's Cup when sailing champ Dennis Conner carried it through the city's  streets on his hero's return from Fremantle, Australia, in 1987. Also absent is  the city's unquestioning desire for the America's Cup regatta. Things have  changed in San Diego.  </P> <P> Three years ago, Conner and Malin Burnham, the San Diego businessman and  world-class yachtsman who spearheaded the Sail America syndicate's Australian  challenge, made San Diego beg for the privilege of holding the next America's  Cup regatta, then planned for 1991. This was despite the fact that the sailing  syndicate's challenge was sponsored by the San Diego Yacht Club. By tradition,  the yacht club whose burgee flutters at the top of the winning boat's mast  hosts the subsequent race.  </P> <P> This year, as president of the America's Cup Organizing Committee, it has been  Burnham's turn to be rebuffed by the same agencies and officials he forced to  beg three years ago. Still $4 million in debt from the 1988 fiasco pitting  Conner's catamaran against New Zealand challenger Michael Fay's hopelessly  outmatched racing sloop, the organizing committee now needs $20 million to  retire the debt and to finance the next cup race -- scheduled 12 months from  now. Burnham hopes to get at least $10 million from public sources, the  remainder from private ones, including corporate donations and television  broadcast fees.  </P> <P> In return, the regatta organizers are promising to reward the region with a  $1.2-billion economic windfall from America's Cup XXVIII, including nearly $50  million in local and state tax revenue. That kind of talk was enticing three  years ago. It isn't today.  </P> <P> Both the county and city of San Diego are in no position to provide funding.  The county is struggling to find ways just to pay for long-needed new jails and  to reinforce the escape-plagued jails it already has. The city of San Diego may  have to lay off staff, freeze hiring for its already too-small police force and  cut back its much underfunded library system to deal with a $60-million budget  shortfall. Meanwhile, the Environmental Protection Agency is forcing city  officials to upgrade its sewage-treatment facilities, which could cost San  Diego as much as $2.8 billion.  </P> <P> Early this year, legislation written by Assemblyman Robert C. Frazee  (R-Carlsbad), proposing the state provide the America Cup's committee with a  $10-million "loan" was shelved after city and county officials opposed the  bill's requirement that the money be matched by regional public funds raised  through a temporary increase in the local hotel occupancy taxes. San Diego's  proposed fiscal '91 budget already calls for diverting money from arts and  tourism programs financed by those revenues for more urgent needs.  </P> <P> Even the normally cash-rich San Diego Unified Port District is beginning to  count its pennies. The agency is fighting several lawsuits, which the port  director says may put much of its surplus money in jeopardy. Port commissioners  have already granted the organizing committee more than $100,000 to begin  planning for the regatta; they will hear another appeal from Burnham on  Tuesday. Cup organizers may have to stand in line behind the five bayside  cities, including San Diego and the nearly bankrupt Imperial Beach, which also  would like to receive some of the district's legendary cash surplus.  </P> <P> Committee officials may even find San Diego corporate dollars wanting. Such  contributions tend to come from corporate headquarters. Since the early 1980s,  when Sail America received strong support from corporations headquartered in  San Diego, the number of such offices here have dwindled. As a result, local  arts and community groups that rely on corporate largess are finding huge voids  in their budgets.  </P> <P> The organizing committee isn't the only group facing money problems. The eight  U.S. sailing syndicates hoping to vie for the privilege of defending the  America's Cup in 1992 will be competing for donations to design and build their  yachts and train their crews.  </P> <P> Several well-financed potential foreign challengers already have boats built  and in the water. So far, the only American hull to wet its keel is a scale  model undergoing tank tests in Escondido. The American syndicates hope to make  up for lost time by pooling design data, but even that technological advantage  may not be enough to overcome the brimming coffers of some foreign challengers.  </P> <P> Even the design of the new 75-foot, America's Cup-class racing sloop presents a  problem. San Diego had more than enough docking space for its predecessor, but  there are few available commercial berths in the harbor deep enough to  accommodate the new boats. Dredging the berthing areas, anchoring barges in or  building platforms out to deeper water may be too costly and environmentally  unsound. San Diego Bay is plagued by several toxic "hot spots," many of them in  areas already envisioned for regatta docking facilities.  </P> <P> Holding a world-class sporting event no doubt has its benefits for San Diego.  Yet even the promise of $1.2 billion in revenues doesn't alleviate the doubts  about the wisdom of publicly financing a yachting regatta.  </P> <P> Yachting remains a rich man's sport. There are few chances to join a pick-up  yacht race in Barrio Logan, Clairemont or anywhere else in the city except,  perhaps, wealthy Point Loma, where the San Diego Yacht Club and other clubs are  located. It is telling that most of the regatta organizers seeking public money  for the race are political and fiscal conservatives who would most likely  oppose public funding of much more needed programs. Furthermore, most of the  regatta-generated revenue would be enjoyed by the tourism-related industries  along the coast, while the region's poorer, inland communities would go  wanting.  </P> <P> The America's Cup has become less a tribute to good sportsmanship than to  personal greed and power. That's how Dennis Conner himself summed it up to  reporters two years ago. "The America's Cup is about money," he said. "Money,  money, money, money. Then power and glory, power and glory, power and glory  after that. That's what it's all about."  </P> <P> The question is what price is that glory, and who should pay it?  </P></p>

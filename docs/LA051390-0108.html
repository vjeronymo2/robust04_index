			<p><P> May 13, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CATCHING ON TO THE HAZARDS OF FISH  </P> <P> It is a genuine nutritional irony: Americans intent on eating a healthier,  low-fat diet are consuming ever-increasing amounts of seafood. In the process,  they are exposing themselves to greater risk of illness, or even death, from  food-borne contamination. That is an unacceptable contradiction, and it will  not be resolved until the current chaos in the sea-food industry is replaced  with clear, well-enforced federal regulations.  </P> <P> The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) estimates that 64,230 Americans became  ill from eating tainted seafood last year, while 22 died. During its most  recent reporting period, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) found that the  number of food-induced illnesses attributable to bad fish or shellfish exceeded  the total number traced to beef and poultry.  </P> <P> That is striking because Americans consume more than four times as much beef  and three times as much poultry as they do seafood.  </P> <P> To some degree, this high level of risk results from the fact that most seafood  is harvested in the wild, where bacterial and chemical contamination cannot  easily be controlled. More important, seafood remains the only important food  source sold to consumer without rigorous, mandatory government standards or  inspections.  </P> <P> Such standards currently are enforced in the meat and poultry industries by the  U.S. Department of Agriculture. To ensure compliance with its regulations, the  department deploys a force of 10,000 inspectors to make daily visits to meat  and poultry processing plants.  </P> <P> By contrast, the FDA, which currently has responsibility for enforcing the  minimal safety, cleanliness and labeling regulations that do exist for seafood,  has 510 inspectors to oversee an estimated 60,000 firms. As a result,  facilities processing fish and shellfish are inspected about once every four  years. Of the 4 billion pounds of seafood consumed in this country every year,  the FDA tests only about 2,000 samples for contamination. The situation is  further complicated by the fact that 60% of America's seafood is imported from  abroad.  </P> <P> At the moment, Congress is considering nine different measures that would  strengthen regulation of the seafood industry, tighten inspections and decide  which federal agency should oversee the program.  </P> <P> It is essential that the law that finally emerges rely on mandatory rather than  voluntary standards. It also should include federal certification of fishing  boats, processing plants and distributors, as well as clear standards on  chemical and microbiological toxin levels and adequate inspections to enforce  them.  </P> <P> Canada, Japan and the Netherlands have such laws; Americans deserve no less.  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 27, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WIDESPREAD INSURANCE SCAM TOLD  </P> <P> Outlining what they termed a scam that has helped inflate insurer losses in the  beleaguered assigned-risk auto insurance system, insurance agents from Los  Angeles and Orange counties testified at a state Insurance Department hearing  Friday that they had been illegally offered up to $1,250 to refer accident  victims to lawyers.  </P> <P> The agents said that sometimes as many as five passengers in a vehicle are  referred at the same time, bringing the agents who might otherwise simply pay  off the claims themselves thousands of dollars in payments from personal-injury  lawyers. An average referral fee is about $900 per person, they said.  </P> <P> "It's ambulance-chasing on a grand scale," said Donald R. Stewart, executive  director of the American Agents Alliance. "Sometimes, it's through agent  referrals. Other times, it's through advertised phone numbers that are easy to  remember, (such as) 222-2222 for Los Angeles."  </P> <P> Calls to the number Friday were answered by a Spanish-speaking operator. She  said no lawyer was on hand to respond to the allegations. No representatives of  lawyer groups testified in regard to the allegations at the two days of  hearings in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Paid agent referrals are a misdemeanor violation of the state's Business and  Professions Code punishable by up to six months in jail and fines up to $2,500.  However, prosecutions of the unlawful solicitation statute have been  comparatively few, according to officials.  </P> <P> The agents blamed growing insurance company losses in paying claims from the  state's 1.3 million assigned-risk drivers on exaggerated and fraudulent claims,  which they said attorneys often make after obtaining referrals.  </P> <P> The hearings turned out to be a powerful demonstration of agent discontent with  both the state's personal-injury attorneys and the insurance companies.  Hundreds of agents attended the hearings, vigorously applauding testimony that  condemned practices of both parties.  </P> <P> Heads of agent associations also testified that virtually all major insurers in  the state are ignoring provisions of Proposition 103 that require them to sell  policies to "all comers" who qualify for "good driver discounts" by virtue of  not having more than one minor traffic violation in the previous three years.  </P> <P> They said that failure has contributed to a situation in which hundreds of  thousands of drivers with good records -- particularly in inner-city areas  populated by racial and ethnic minorities -- are joining the assigned-risk  system, which was designed to be an insurer of last resort for bad drivers.  </P> <P> Earlier in the hearings, the head of the board of governors of the Assigned  Risk Plan, Edward Held of Allstate Insurance Co., testified that claims costs  among assigned-risk drivers are "out of control" and that the system is  "unraveling."  </P> <P> Under assigned risk, drivers are allocated to insurance companies in proportion  to the total business each firm does in the state. In recent years, Insurance  Commissioner Roxani Gillespie, who attended the hearing Thursday, has tried to  hold down the rates. Gradually, in urban areas, enrolling in assigned risk has  become cheaper than buying a regular policy.  </P> <P> Gillespie has refused for nearly a year to accede to an insurer request for an  average 112% increase in assigned-risk rates. This has prompted several  companies to sue to get the higher rates or to be excused from participating in  the system.  </P> <P> In his testimony, Held estimated assigned-risk losses at $600 million for 1989.  He said that two companies, Cal Farm and Sequoia, now are refusing assignments  of drivers, and that others, including such major auto insurers as State Farm  and Allstate, are accepting assignments only under protest.  </P> <P> Consumer representatives testified, however, that pushing assigned-risk rates  up would be unfair without legislative action to provide a no-frills policy for  the poor.  </P> <P> Altogether, a picture was painted at the hearing of an auto insurance system in  considerable disarray. The angriest testimony, however, came from individual  agents who said the prevailing system has put them under intolerable pressures.  </P> <P> Maria Palmer, of Palmer Insurance in Santa Ana, testified that she has incurred  anger from many attorneys for refusing to make paid referrals.  </P></p>

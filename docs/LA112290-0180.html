			<p><P> November 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: FAIRFAX;  </P> <P> PARK LABREA REVIEW STALLED  </P> <P> The management of the Park Labrea apartment complex has received yet another  postponement for a hearing on its long-pending appeal on a request to pass on  to tenants the cost of a $3-million fencing and gating project. The request was  previously denied.  </P> <P> The issue had been scheduled to come up for review on Nov. 16, but is now set  for March 1, 1991, at 9 a.m., at the Rent Stabilization Division offices on 6th  Street in downtown Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Roger Winegar, general manager of Park Labrea, said that much of the delay is  due to the need to determine just how much it cost to undertake the early  phases of the project at a time when May Co. stores were the sole owners of the  property.  </P> <P> "The Rent Stabilization Board wanted not just the amount, but the documentation  for all of it," he said. May Co. has since sold a half-interest in the project  to the Cleveland-based Forest City real estate company.  </P> <P> Because May Co. did not keep track of the time that its lawyers, engineers and  other employees put into the complex procedure of taking over the city-owned  streets, the process is proving time-consuming, Winegar said.  </P> <P> Park Labrea, with about 10,000 tenants, is the largest rental complex on the  Westside. Access was limited to residents and their guests when the fencing  system went into operation in 1989.  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 25, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA;  </P> <P> 1991 RESOLUTIONS: MARY HORNBUCKLE, MAYOR OF COSTA MESA.  </P> <P> I resolve to be a peacemaker in city government and to help groups throughout  the community feel that they are a part of the process.  </P> <P> I am planning to invite all of the homeowners associations in the community to  send a representative to a series of meetings with me and the staff to discuss  issues. We are also in the process of starting another round of living room  dialogues that will bring together people of different ethnic backgrounds to  improve the relations in the city. I am hoping to lessen the us against them  attitude.  </P></p>

			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / Strike-hit Iberia's staff seek sacking of bosses The Spanish government is under strong pressure to sack the chairman of INI, the public sector holding which owns Iberia, the state airline, together with some of the airline's senior executives after most flights were grounded yesterday in a worsening pay dispute. Amid signs that the two main unions which called yesterday's stoppage risk losing control over the dispute, minority unions, representing ground staff as well as cabin crews, have called for partial stoppages today and more strikes over the next month. Iberia has warned that an escalation of the protest, called to demand overdue back pay and in protest at proposed staff and salary cuts, would cripple the company financially. The airline is due to declare losses of Pta44bn (Pounds 216m) this year and yesterday's stoppage is estimated to have cost Iberia up to Pta1bn in lost revenue. In a new twist to the dispute, the airline's middle management has taken the unprecedented step of calling on the government to remove senior executives of both INI and Iberia. More than 500 of Iberia's 1,300-strong technical and intermediate level personnel signed a letter to the industry minister blaming senior management for the company's difficulties, and stressing that no viability plan would be accepted by the airline's staff while they remained in place. A spokesman for the organisers of the petition said there was now a serious risk that the dispute could run out of control because hardline minority unions were planning new stoppages and undermining the authority of the socialist-led General Workers Union and the communist-dominated Workers Commissions union, which had jointly initiated the strike action. 'Unless there is a big top-level shake-up this strike is going to match in violence the one at Air France last year,' the spokesman said. The October 1993 Air France strike cost Mr Bernard Attali his job as the airline's chairman and forced the French government to revise drastic spending cuts for the company which were similar to those envisaged now by Iberia. The airline has proposed pay cuts averaging 15 per cent over the next three years, accompanied by 2,000 further job cuts as part of a viability plan which combines reducing operating costs by 10 per cent with a capital injection of Pta125bn (Pounds 613m). The targets of employee anger are Mr Juan Saenz, who was appointed Iberia's managing director last year, and Mr Javier Salas, the chairman of INI and, since September 1993, also president of Iberia. As INI chairman Mr Salas endorsed an ambitious airline investment programme by Iberia in Latin America which lies at the heart of the company's present financial difficulties. INI is now seeking authorisation from the European Union to use subsidies for the recapitalisation. The industry minister, Mr Juan Manuel Eguiagaray, who is responsible for INI and has an ultimate say over Iberia and the group's other companies, is understood to be increasingly dissatisfied with INI's leadership. Criticism of the public sector holding company is also rife among members of the government's economic team, appalled at its mounting losses - Pta125bn in 1993, up from Pta72bn the previous year.</p>

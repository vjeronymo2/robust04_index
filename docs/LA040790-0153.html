			<p><P> April 7, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LISTEN TO YOUR GRANDMOTHER;  </P> <P> FAMILY: SOCIAL PROGRAMS ARE NOT ENOUGH TO STOP THE DECLINE BECAUSE THE ROOT OF  THE PROBLEM IS CULTURAL, NOT ECONOMIC OR POLITICAL.  </P> <P> Most people today agree that the American family is in trouble. More than 60%  of Americans, for example, feel that "family values" are losing ground,  according to a poll commissioned by Mass Mutual Life Insurance Co. Most see the  nation's "quality of family life" not only as deteriorating and likely to get  worse, but also as an underlying source of many social problems. Similarly, a  Harris poll finds that most adults believe that it's harder to be a child today  than when they were growing up.  </P> <P> Even scholarly experts on the family -- until recently much more sanguine than  the general public -- now tend to agree with this pessimistic assessment. At a  recent Stanford conference a wide diversity of prominent scholars argued that  the family is becoming less able to carry out its basic social functions. Most  indicators of child well-being, for example, show that the quality of life for  America's children is declining. Our society suffers from a family deficit --  one that is probably more dangerous than either our trade or budget deficits.  </P> <P> The controversial question is no longer whether we have a family deficit, but  why. The debate now shifts from conditions to causes, since understanding  causes is the logical requirement for offering solutions.  </P> <P> There are two likely competing answers to the question, "What is the source of  today's family dilemma?"  </P> <P> Call the first explanation "Reagan closed the bathrooms." This label is  inspired by a trend in New York City: People have taken to urinating on the  sidewalks. Not just the homeless, or even the poor, but all manner of citizens  who, well, feel the need to go. What causes this behavior? One answer is the  shortage of public toilets and the government's neglect of public amenities. In  short, the root cause is not changing standards of personal behavior, but  instead those larger political and economic forces that, in effect, close the  bathrooms.  </P> <P> Precisely this philosophy governs much of the family debate. According to this  view, the crisis is not even primarily about the family. The problem lies in  outside institutions, such as the workplace and government, that fail to  respond to new realities: divorce, single-parent homes, the two-gender work  force, teen-age parenthood, latch-key children, and so on. The challenge is not  to change family behavior, but to change those larger institutions. Schools  must help, not stigmatize, unwed teen-age parents. Corporations must subsidize  child care. Courts must confer equal legal status on alternative life styles.  </P> <P> The main alternative to this perspective might be termed "Grandmother knows  best." The label refers to my conclusion that you will learn more about the  American family from 10 grandmothers than you will from 10 family experts. Take  the issue of single-parent homes. Are they "just as good as" two-parent homes?  Experts in conference rooms are likely to resist making "value judgments."  Grandmothers on front porches are not so inhibited. They are likely to tell you  plainly that two parents are better than one. They tend to say things like:  "People today care more about themselves and less about others." "They are less  willing to make sacrifices." "Children today are not taught a sense of right  and wrong."  </P> <P> In this view, the problem is not the system. The problem is us. Parents not  spending enough time with their kids. Children bearing children. People seeing  family obligations as an obstacle to self-fulfillment rather than as a pathway  to it. The source of the dilemma, therefore, is not economic or political, but  cultural. The problem is an increasingly atomized, adult-centered society in  which expressive individualism has become a governing cultural ideal,  overshadowing and, to some degree, displacing other norms such as civic virtue,  religious beliefs and family values.  </P> <P> Which viewpoint will guide public discourse in the 1990s? I suspect the smart  money is with "Reagan closed the bathrooms." It's easier to argue, and it leads  to policy ideas. And, of course, there is much truth in this perspective. I  certainly wish that "they" would re-open -- indeed, build more -- public  toilets. I also wish they would provide better medical care to poor children,  improve the schools, open more drug-treatment centers and help parents with  child care. I favor raising my taxes -- or yours, anyway -- in order to do  this.  </P> <P> But I do not kid myself that these measures -- or 100 like them -- strike at  the heart of why the family as a social institution is in decline. In the final  analysis, the grandmothers are right. The source of that decline is cultural.  Reagan can close public toilets, and I can vote against him because of it. But  he does not -- he cannot -- cause me to urinate in public. Only I can decide to  do that. And if what we as a society are doing to the family is the cultural  equivalent of urinating in the street, then public policy is simply not enough  to solve our dilemma.  </P></p>

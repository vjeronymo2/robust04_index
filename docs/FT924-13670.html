			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Florida hails bumper orange crop FORECASTS OF abundant citrus supplies from Florida this year may be depressing futures prices but they have cheered officials at the Florida Citrus Commission. 'We've got 92m trees - the most we've ever had,' said Mr Dan Gunter, executive director of the Florida Department of Citrus. 'Lower prices make Florida orange juice an even more attractive, nutritious beverage alternative.' Although US growers were braced for lower prices, output is up so much that they can also expect increased earnings. Some of the higher production will be disposed of through exports. Japan, particularly, is a growing market for Florida orange juice. Florida dominates US citrus output. Last year it accounted for 69 per cent of US citrus production, while California accounted for 28 per cent, and Arizona, 3 per cent. Texas is still recovering from several freezes and last year accounted for less than 1 per cent of US production. Acreage is higher this year in California and Florida, but lower in Texas and Arizona. After years of damaging freezes, the citrus growers' luck changed this year. Hurricane Andrew and a number of punishing tornadoes passed them by. If winter passes the region by, the state can expect the third largest citrus crop in its history. USDA estimated that the crop would produce 186m boxes of oranges, a rise of 33 per cent from last year. The grapefruit crop could hit 54m, a jump of 27 per cent. Production of Florida's specialty varieties - tangerines, temples and tangelos - is expected to reach 8.6m boxes, up 15 per cent this year. In 1991-92, the value of the total US crop rose only 2 per cent to Dollars 2.45bn. Higher production during the season led to lower prices received by the growers. Total citrus crop values increased in Arizona, California and Texas, while declining in Florida.</p>

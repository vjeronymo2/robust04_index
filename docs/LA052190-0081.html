Brezhnev.  </P> <P> The Soviet news agency Tass said Kirilenko rose through the party ranks with  Brezhnev, who like him was from the Ukraine. When Brezhnev succeeded Nikita S.  Khrushchev, Kirilenko's stature also rose, and in 1966 he was named Central  Committee secretary for internal political questions and party work, taking  charge of day-to-day party activities. He spent 16 years in the Politburo  before being pensioned off in 1982, the year of Brezhnev's death, to live in  relative obscurity. Brezhnev is now routinely criticized as having presided  over a "period of stagnation." In Moscow on May 12.  </P></p>

The plan was endorsed by the ruling Latvia's Way - Farmers'  Union coalition, the Concord for Latvia faction, the Democratic  Party faction and the Equality of Rights (Lidztiesiba) faction.    The Latvian National Independence Movement faction, the  Homeland and Freedom, and the Christian Democrats Union  factions, however, proposed to postpone the approvement until  the draft's "conceptual re-arrangement."    The budget lacks clearcut concepts for the defense sphere  and  the local administration, said Alexander Kirsteins of the  Independence Movement.    The government adjusted the planned incomes to the  chaotically developing economy, said Equality of Rights' Larisa  Lavina, who objected to the plan's economic motivation.    On the other hand, the budget plan duly reflects "the budget  of a small, economically haphazard country" that earns almost  nothing from industry and foreign investments, said Concord's  leader Edvins Kide.    The debate corresponded to the general world practice -- the  ruling coalition tried to persuade the critical opposition into  approving a project, said Andrejs Pantelejevs, the head of the  Latvia's Way faction.</p>

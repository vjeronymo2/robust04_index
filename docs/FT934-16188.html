			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / International Company News: Flughafen Wien rises 5% in first six months FLUGHAFEN WIEN, the partially privatised operator of Vienna's international airport, said its net income in the first half rose 5 per cent to Sch251m on revenues of Sch1.46bn (Dollars 121m), up 6.4 per cent. The airport said that slow growth in aircraft maximum take-off weights restrained revenue growth in the first half. Passenger volume rose only 5.2 per cent and freight tonnage gained only 4.2 per cent. Meanwhile, operating costs jumped 20.5 per cent, mainly because of an overhaul of a runway. Operating profit thus tumbled 40 per cent to Sch187.4m. Thanks to a successful net financial result, pre-tax profits rose 29.9 per cent to Sch263.5m. The directors cautioned that prospects could be affected by whatever alliance decision Austrian Airlines made. The airline, which accounts for 44.3 per cent of passenger flows at the airport, is considering co-operation plans offered by Lufthansa of Germany and by the Alcazar project with three other European airlines.</p>

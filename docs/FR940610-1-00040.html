			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (B)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Diversions of income and corpus.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A standard section 7520 income factor for an ordinary income interest is not to be used to value an income interest or similar interest in property for a term of years or for one or more measuring lives if_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) The trust, will, or other governing instrument requires or permits the beneficiary's income or other enjoyment to be withheld, diverted, or accumulated for another person's benefit without the consent of the income beneficiary; or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) The governing instrument requires or permits trust corpus to be withdrawn from the trust for another person's benefit during the income beneficiary's term of enjoyment without the consent of and accountability to the income beneficiary for such diversion. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Remainder and reversionary interests.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A standard section 7520 remainder interest factor for an ordinary remainder or reversionary interest is not to be used to determine the present value of a remainder or reversionary interest (whether in trust or otherwise) unless, consistent with the preservation and protection that the law of trusts would provide for a person who is unqualifiedly designated as the remainder beneficiary of a trust for a similar duration, the effect of the administrative and dispositive provisions for the interest or interests that precede the remainder or reversionary interest is to assure that the property will be adequately preserved and protected from erosion, invasion, depletion, or damage until the remainder or reversionary interest takes effect in possession and enjoyment. This degree of preservation and protection is provided only if it was the transferor's intent, as manifested by the provisions of the arrangement and the surrounding circumstances, that the entire disposition provide the remainder or reversionary beneficiary with an undiminished interest in the property transferred. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Pooled income fund interests.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In general, pooled income funds are created and administered to achieve a special rate of return. A beneficial interest in a pooled income fund is not ordinarily valued using a standard section 7520 income or remainder interest factor. The present value of a beneficial interest in a pooled income fund is determined according to rules and special remainder factors prescribed in &sect;1.642(c)&hyph;6. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Mortality component.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The mortality component prescribed under section 7520 is not to be used to determine the present value of an annuity, income interest, remainder interest, or reversionary interest if an individual who is a measuring life for the interest dies or is terminally ill at the time of the transaction. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(3), an individual who is known to have an incurable illness or other deteriorating physical condition is considered terminally ill if there is at least a 50 percent probability that the individual will die within 1 year. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Examples.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The provisions of this paragraph (b) are illustrated by the following examples: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Example 1._Annuity funded with unproductive property.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The taxpayer transfers corporation stock worth $1,000,000 to a trust. The trust provides for a 6 percent ($60,000 per year) annuity in cash or other property to be paid to a charitable organization for 25 years and for the remainder to be distributed to the donor's child. The trust specifically authorizes, but does not require, the trustee to retain the shares of stock. The section 7520 interest rate for the month of the transfer is 8.2 percent. The corporation has paid no dividends on this stock during the past 5 years, and there is no indication that this policy will change in the near future. Under applicable state law, the corporation is considered to be a sound investment for a trust with diversified investments because the corporation's practice of retaining its earnings has caused the value of the corporation stock to grow commensurately each year. Considering the 6 percent annuity payout rate and the 8.2 percent section 7520 interest rate, the trust corpus is considered sufficient to pay this annuity for the entire 25-year term of the trust, or even indefinitely. Thus, though the trust assets not likely to earn dividend income during the term of the trust, the assets would be assumed to appreciate at the rate of 8.2 percent per year if there were no income. Therefore, the trust's sole investment in this corporation is not expected to adversely affect the interest of either the annuitant or the remainder beneficiary. Although it appears that neither beneficiary would be able to compel the trustee to make the trust corpus produce investment income, the annuity interest in this case is considered to be an ordinary annuity interest, and the standard section 7520 annuity factor may be used to determine the present value of the annuity. In this case, the section 7520 annuity factor would represent the right to receive $1.00 per year for a term of 25 years. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Example 2._Terminal illness.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The taxpayer transfers property worth $1,000,000, to a charitable remainder unitrust described in section 664(d)(2) and &sect;1.664&hyph;3. The trust provides for a fixed-percentage 7 percent unitrust benefit (each annual payment is equal to 7 percent of the trust assets as valued at the beginning of each year) to be paid quarterly to an individual beneficiary for life and for the remainder to be distributed to a charitable organization. At the time the trust is created, the individual beneficiary is age 60 and has been diagnosed with an incurable illness and there is at least a 50 percent probability of the individual dying within 1 year. Because there is at least a 50 percent probability that this beneficiary will die within 1 year, the standard section 7520 unitrust remainder factor for a person age 60 from the valuation tables may not be used to determine the present value of the charitable remainder interest. Instead, a special unitrust remainder factor must be computed that is based on the section 7520 interest rate and that takes into account the projection of the individual beneficiary's actual life expectancy. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (5)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Additional limitations.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 7520 does not apply to the extent provided by the Internal Revenue Service in revenue rulings or revenue procedures. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Effective date.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The provisions of paragraph (b) of this section are effective with respect to transactions after the date these regulations are published as final regulations in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=56 g=1 f=1 --> PART 20_ESTATE TAX; ESTATES OF DECEDENTS DYING AFTER AUGUST 16, 1954 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

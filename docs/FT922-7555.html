			<p>920518 FT  18 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: Fiat A year ago, Fiat maintained its dividend even though its attributable profits were halved. Investors who thought that payout signalled confidence about recovery were badly mistaken. The question is what they are to make of last Friday's 30 per cent fall in Fiat's 1991 profits and the accompanying 40 per cent dividend cut. If anything, the recovery argument is rather stronger this time, not least because Italian car demand unexpectedly rose by 4 per cent in the first quarter of this year. There is still room for doubt, in particular about the scope for losses in the tractor division. But the lower base for the dividend makes a further cut unlikely, and Fiat should avoid making an overall loss this year. Judging by the rise in its shares after the figures were announced, the market believes that Fiat is close to turning the corner. The ride could be bumpy all the same.</p>

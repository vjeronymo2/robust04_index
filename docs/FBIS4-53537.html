			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 20 (KCNA) -- The South Korean  National Committee of Struggle for the Reinstatement of the  Detained, wanted and dismissed workers (Chonhaetu), an  organization embracing workers of some 40 businesses, called for  rising general turnout in the struggle for the reinstatement of  dismissed workers at a rally held with the attendance of some  1,000 workers, students and citizens, according to a South  Korean newspaper report.    It criticized the Kim Yong-sam regime for turning a deaf ear  to voices of the workers across the country calling for  reinstatement and the guarantee of their right to live. "The  reinstatement of the dismissed workers is possible only when a  mass struggle is waged," it said, and stressed: "Let all of us  devote our efforts, lives and energy to the struggle for their  reinstatement."    It declared that the dismissed workers in all parts of South  Korea would enter into a tent sit-in and a hunger strike for an  indefinite period and wage a death-defying battle till their  demands have been met.</p>

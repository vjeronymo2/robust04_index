			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin said today that  Israel will not start implementing the Gaza-Jericho agreement  before a written, mutually-acceptable, and detailed agreement  has been attained. The prime minister added that only a miracle  will enable the completion of the negotiations next week, and  that some of the issues discussed in Davos remain open. The  Palestinians have not reported to the economic talks in Paris  for two weeks, Rabin stated, and the negotiations on the  transfer of civil powers are stuck. Our political correspondent  Shlomo Raz points out that the prime minister made these remarks  after the signing ceremony of scientific agreements with Austria.    [Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew at 1400 GMT on 2 February  adds:  "Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin stated today that PLO leader Yasir  'Arafat's goal is to establish a Palestinian state in the first  stage, and a confederation with Jordan at a later stage." In a  recorded passage in English, Rabin says: "To the best of my  knowledge, the goal is a Palestinian state; perhaps after that a  confederation. But, this is not my problem."]    [Referring to the reported criticism of security officials  at  the understandings reached in Davos by Foreign Minister Shim'on  Peres and 'Arafat, Rabin said "he did not want to get into  abstract and fabricated arguments."]</p>

			<p><P> September 17, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> NORTH CAROLINA ST. TRIES TO REGAIN SOLID FOOTING IN SOME SHAKY TIMES  </P> <P> Sitting in his narrow, fourth-floor Williams Hall office, stacked high with  books with titles such as "Methods of Enzymology," Professor Raymond Long tried  to explain why many North Carolina State University faculty members think  basketball coach Jim Valvano should be asked to take his show elsewhere.  </P> <P> "There is a feeling that it's a bit of contradiction for him to remain as coach  when the chancellor (Bruce R. Poulton) has resigned because of problems  occurring in his basketball program," said Long, chairman of the faculty senate  and a professor of crop science, specializing in tobacco. "You can see the  argument."  </P> <P> This town and this state have been immersed in a swirl of emotional arguments  for nine months. The debate centers on Valvano's program and his players, whose  performance in the NCAA tournament has been found to have been better than its  showing in the classroom and at commencement.  </P> <P> And now there are NCAA violations to be answered and penalties loom on the  horizon. The university's top official is already out. Valvano will soon  relinquish his athletic director's post as he was asked to. Who will be next,  who will replace them all, and will Valvano be part of N.C. State's future?  </P> <P> "There's no question that it's unsettled," said senior associate athletic  director Frank Weedon. "But steps are being taken to correct the situation ...  the search for an interim athletic director and a full-time athletic director  will solve the problems. But right now, I wouldn't call them normal  circumstances."  </P> <P> The controversy began in January, when the Raleigh News and Observer published  details contained in a jacket for author Peter Golenbock's book, which include  allegations that players received payments and privileges from boosters and  improper grade changes were made. Talk of a lawsuit led to Golenbock's being  forced to find another publisher, but the book, "Personal Fouls," hit the  shelves in July and is now a national best-seller.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the NCAA and a special commission conducted investigations and the  chancellor resigned. Those inquiries found some NCAA violations, though not to  the extent discussed in the book. There also was some serious twisting of  academic rules to keep players eligible.  </P> <P> Some, including former player Bennie Bolton, say Valvano is interested solely  in himself and winning, and will do what is necessary to achieve that. Others  argue that N.C. State needed a "charisma bypass," as one Valvano supporter put  it, and that Valvano's vitality spread through the athletic department to the  rest of the university, with mostly positive effects on both.  </P> <P> Some think Valvano will survive the turmoil and remain at N.C. State in order  to repair his reputation and the school's. Some think the school may ask him to  leave, and others think he'll jump at the first good job -- coaching or  broadcasting -- that comes along.  </P> <P> "I would like to point out that I'm not a man without options -- that I want  very much to be here," Valvano said at the time of the Poole Commission, which  called for him to step down as athletic director. "I would like very much the  opportunity to show and to prove that we can, in fact we will, get the job done  off the court with the help of a great many people.  </P> <P> "We all must accept the responsibility of both our positions and either of our  actions or lack of same. I have no other goal but to run our basketball program  in a way that would be absolutely beyond reproach. We have had a problem here  which is well-documented. I accept the responsibility for it and the  accountability, and the players do also. Yes, changes have to be made. We're  very committed to it."  </P> <P> Still many think it was only Valvano's contract, which includes a $500,000  buyout clause if he goes to another school, that kept him from taking the UCLA  job in 1988 when there wasn't a hint of trouble.  </P> <P> As Long said, "The final chapter in this has yet to be written."  </P> <P> Around Raleigh even some of Valvano's detractors don't think much of  Golenbock's book. During a lull in the N.C. State-Maryland football game,  Wolfpack partisans started derisively chanting Golenbock's name and there was a  banner denouncing him. There was also a banner referring to Poulton that read,  "Goodbye Bruce, Can we have your seats?"  </P> <P> Les Crenshaw, a 1971 graduate, was among the many outside Carter-Finley Stadium  and he seemed a bit torn between liking Valvano and wanting a fresh start. Like  many Wolfpack fans, he blames the News and Observer for blowing it out of  proportion and reads Tar Heel blue between the lines, since several of the  newspaper's staff went to archrival North Carolina. But there is a desire to  fix the wrongs.  </P> <P> "If Valvano knew about it and let it happen, then he ought to be punished,"  Crenshaw said. "The board of trustees will do that."  </P> <P> Appropriate punishment?  </P> <P> "I think he's already been punished," Crenshaw said. "We love him to death."  </P> <P> That love stems in large part from the NCAA title Valvano brought home from  Albuquerque in 1983. But the trophy -- and the school -- clearly has lost a bit  of luster.  </P> <P> "The faculty has felt that the image of the institution has been tarnished,"  said Long, who has heard faculty members say their complaints went unanswered.  "Faculty concerns go back a number of years. Only more recently have those  concerns been confirmed."  </P> <P> In late August, C.D. Spangler, president of the University of North Carolina  Board of Governors, which oversees the state university system, announced the  findings of the Poole Commission, which was formed to investigate the program.  The commission found academic abuses of the system and deficient academic  performance by many basketball players, but Spangler reported no improper  grade-changing.  </P> <P> "The system has been misused. The spirit, not the letter, of the law has been  broken," he said.  </P> <P> Spangler gave an example of one player, who received a non-passing grade in a  class, but convinced the instructor that he would make up the missed exam and  pass the class. So the instructor changed the grade to an incomplete. But the  player then postponed the scheduled makeup once and ignored it the next time.  The instructor changed the grade to no credit, but because the incomplete grade  was on the record at the start of the semester, the player was eligible for the  whole season.  </P> <P> "The Poole Commision pointed out in clear terms ... what is probably the  critical issue: it is the need of the basketball program to support more  decisively the enforcement of academic rules," Spangler said.  </P> <P> Since 1980 when Valvano arrived, 43 basketball players have been admitted to  N.C. State. Nine are returning to the team this year. Of the remaining 34,  eight earned degrees from N.C. State and three graduated from other schools.  </P> <P> So there is an overall graduation rate of 32 percent, 24 percent from N.C.  State itself. (The graduation rate for the rest of the student body is 22  percent after four years, 52 percent after five years and 58 percent after six  years.) Of the remaining 23 players who were on the team, three left in good  standing, five were under some type of academic warning and 15 were suspended  for academic reasons.  </P> <P> Last week the school released the NCAA's letter of official inquiry, which is  essentially the list of charges. The NCAA said that players sold complimentary  tickets for as much as $150 each, sold athletic shoes to local stores, received  discounts from a local jewelry store and received food and lodging from  athletic boosters.  </P> <P> The school will have at least six weeks to respond and probably will go before  the Committee on Infractions in November.  </P> <P> Valvano, who declined to be interviewed for this article, said last week that  he did not know players had sold tickets or shoes and indications are that he  will remain as athletic director at least until the NCAA makes its judgment.  </P> <P> That will be just a few days after the early signing period for the next batch  of recruits. Four of the players he signed last year did not enroll and are  headed for junior college.  </P> <P> The number of this year's high-school seniors willing to sign up -- and what  sort of academic credentials they bring with them -- might prove to be a sign  of whether Valvano remains at N.C. State.  </P> <P> "I believe that overall we have an excellent athletic program, in which  students are doing well scholastically as well as athletically," Long said,  referring to teams like Dick Sheridan's football squad, which graduated 17 of  19 seniors last spring. "It shows that it's already possible under the present  set of conditions to excel academically and engage in intercollegiate  athletics."  </P></p>

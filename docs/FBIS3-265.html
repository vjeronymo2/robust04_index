			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by the ANC on 3 March on the SAPA PR Wire </F> Service]    [Text] Housing. The problem is staggering 3.5 millions  housing units needed just to catch up with the backlog. Over 5  million people in misery in urban squatter camps and informal  settlements, their numbers rising by over 200,000 a year;  thousands more in unacceptable urban hostels; an unknown number  in farm and rural slums. This is not something to be dealt with  in some vote-catching `number contest', like that recently  unveiled -- and then withdrawn -- by the NP [National Party] and  Minister Shills.    Housing the homeless will be one of the most critical  challenges the new government will face. The ANC [African  National Congress] in government will give it an urgent  priority. An immediate start will have to be made on it as soon  as the new government is formed. The framework of the ANC policy  is clear. It rests on the ANC belief that all South Africans  have a right to decent and affordable housing; that government  must take on the responsibility of directing the management of  the available financial, manpower and material resources in  order to translate that right into actual homes.    The programme we have adopted is also staggering. It  proposes to speed up house building vastly so as to provide 1  million houses within the first five years; to achieve an annual  rate of building of 350,000 houses a year, (compared with the NP  government's record figure of 50,000 in 1992). That scale of  action will provide affordable for low income families in town  and country. It will break the backlog of homelessness and  hostel squalor within ten years. No one should underestimate  the magnitude of that task.    But can it be done? We are confident that, with the ANC in  the driving seat of government, it can. Our programme is not  simply a set of aims. It is a realistic statement of the state  action that will be taken during the early days of an ANC  government.    We propose to set up a single national housing department to  replace the wasteful 14 departments left behind by the NP  government. We propose to commit greatly increased funds to the  housing programme, rising to 5 percent of the state budget with  five years. We propose to challenge private financial  institutions to match the state contribution of R[rand]50  billion over ten years, the funds to be vested in a housing  finance bank which will co- ordinate housing subsidies and home  loan guarantees.    We will ensure that the available funds are used to meet  national priorities, namely: (a) the provision of affordable  public and subsidised housing together with a rented sector,  especially for low-income families in town and country; (b) a  thorough programme of reconstruction of urban hostels into  acceptable standard family or single-person homes; (c) the  upgrading of existing subsidised housing to meet agreed national  minimum standards of construction and service provision.    We will seek to persuade employers and trade unions to plan  the provision of housing for their own employees, in reasonable  proximity to the workplace. We will explore the possibilities  of providing tax or other financial incentives to encourage  acceptable schemes.    In accordance with our overall democratic approach, we will  strip away the existing covers of secrecy and confidentiality  which should housing policies. We will insist on full public  disclosure by all housing bodies of all information relating to  plans and decisions; that policy making is open and transparent;  that all housing organisations are publicly accountable for  their actions; and that proper arrangements are made for public  participation in policy planning at all levels. This will  apply, inter alia, to the setting of minimum constructional  standards, the selection of sites and appropriate services for  new housing, the overall planning of housing schemes, the  allocation of funds to both public and private sector schemes.    We will ensure that the national priorities in other fields  are taken fully into account in housing matters. Accordingly,  wherever financial parameters can be maintained, we will insist  that preference be given to labour intensive schemes in order to  put the jobless back to work; and that preference in allotting  contracts is given to small contractors and suppliers in order  to redress past discrimination in favour of big business and  white entrepreneurs.    These are the basic elements of the ANC programme. It has  been developed with inputs from many other organisations which  are co-ordinated within the National Housing Forum. At this  time it is possible that in that forum further specific  propositions may emerge which will be incorporated in our actual  programme in government. It is not yet clear which aspects of  delivery and execution of a national housing programme will  finally be devolved to regional or provincial government  structures. But this statement sets out the ANC national  programme. It will form the guidelines and set the parameters  for all ANC members in public office at any level of the  administration.</p>

			<p><P> July 6, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> BAD WELDS REPORTEDLY CAUSED CANOPY CRASH;  </P> <P> SAFETY: A REPORT BY THE SAN DIEGO BUILDING INSPECTION DEPARTMENT FIXES BLAME  FOR THE JUNE 15 COLLAPSE AT ROBINSON'S IN UNIVERSITY TOWNE CENTRE.  </P> <P> Bad welds appear to be the cause of the June 15 collapse of a canopy at  Robinson's department store in University Towne Centre, which injured one girl  and nearly buried several other people.  </P> <P> "The canopy failed because it was not constructed according to plans. Welding  of the metal studs to the steel beam was not done to the specifications on the  plans," according to a press release from the San Diego Building Inspection  Department.  </P> <P> The release also stated that "wind and weather" contributed to the failure of  the deficient welds.  </P> <P> Pete Lopez, chief of structural inspection for the department, said the welds  were not strong enough to support stucco and other materials in the canopy.  </P> <P> Shortly after the collapse, the city ordered the upscale department store chain  to have the canopy and the rest of the building inspected by an engineering  firm. The store hired Englekirk &amp; Hart Consulting Engineers, and their  findings are the source for the building inspection department's report, Lopez  said.  </P> <P> Robinson's Spokeswoman Kelly Barfield in Los Angeles said the Hahn Co. of La  Jolla was the contractor responsible for the store's construction.  </P> <P> The Hahn Co. was owned by Ernest Hahn at the time of the store's construction,  Barfield said. The company has since changed hands.  </P> <P> Barfield had no other comment on the collapse, and there was no answer at the  telephone number of the Hahn Co. after the city's report was released late  Thursday afternoon.  </P> <P> Lopez said that, during construction of public buildings, the city requires  constant supervision by a "special inspector" during all welding to ensure  structural integrity. The city, however, does not keep the reports filed by the  inspectors, he said.  </P> <P> The principle responsibility of the inspection department is to ensure the  safety of public structures, and no action will be taken against Robinson's or  the builders of the canopy, Lopez said.  </P> <P> The engineering firm also determined that two other canopies, which were  constructed differently from the one that collapsed, are not a hazard, he said.  </P> <P> Lopez said he does not know why all three canopies were not constructed the  same way. That decision was "the architect's prerogative," he said.  </P> <P> The welds on the other two canopies were "found to be completed per the plans,"  according to the Building Inspection Department's release.  </P></p>

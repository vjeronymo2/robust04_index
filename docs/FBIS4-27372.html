			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by NAEWOE News Agency] </F>   [Text] It is noteworthy to note that it appears that North  Korea will actively oppose Russia's participation in the  Nonaligned Movement's [NAM] meeting and demand that the articles  on the U.S.- DPRK talks and on implementing the International  Atomic Energy Agency's safeguards accord be eliminated in the  content of the draft of the final declaration, at the 11th  nonaligned foreign ministers' meeting, which is to begin on 31  May.    North Korea, which is dispatching a 16-man delegation  including Foreign Minister Kim Yong-nam, is strongly opposing  Russia from joining the nonaligned meeting by saying that it  runs counter to the ideology of the nonaligned meeting.    Among the content of the draft of the final declaration,  North Korea will request the elimination on the part on the  U.S.-DPRK talks and on implementing the nuclear safeguards  accord. It is strengthening diplomatic activities with  nonaligned countries.</p>

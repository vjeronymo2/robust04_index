			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Aleksey Kirpichnikov report under the "Difficulty": </F> "Subsistence Wage To Match Consumer Basket"]    [Text] Aleksandr Osovtsov, deputy chairman of the State  Duma Labor and Social Support Committee, and committee member  Valentin Lednev, both associated with "Russia's Choice," spoke  at a news conference about the faction's activities in making  laws pertaining to the social sphere. At their prompting, the  Duma Council has decided to include in the plan of immediate  legislation laws on the subsistence wage and on veterans, which  were elaborated with the active participation of "Russia's  Choice." The portfolio of the faction and the committee also  contains a program to combat poverty, draft laws on social  services, on social protection for the disabled, and on ritual  support (a euphemism for burial services). Thus, the organizers  of the news conference underlined, "Russia's Choice" is as good  as its pledge to the voters.    The faction's approach to social policy is special in that  it  is trying to find a common denominator of social payments. For  example, there are now 54 decrees in effect on provision of  benefits to veterans. Some normative acts, however, treat all  alike. Mr. Osovtsov cited the example of Robert Kennedy, a  father of nine, who would have been legally eligible for the  "multiple children benefit." There is an equal mess about  housing, and so on. "Our objective is not to endlessly discuss  the issue but to give at least a spoonful to each who are  hungry," Mr. Osovtsev underlined.    Such a common denominator should apply to the subsistence  wage. The law on it relies on federal budget appropriations to  the tune of 2.6 trillion rubles (for benefits to the needy) and  is supposed to go into effect as of 1 January 1995. The draft  law provides for a dual principle of counting: The subsistence  wage level to be established in every federation component is 40  percent of the average per capita income but not less than the  cost of the consumer basket.    The same dual macro-approach of the "Choice" applies to  social policy. On the one hand, Mr. Gaydar constantly reminds  about the need to cut back centralized subsidies, while on the  other hand, "Russia's Choice" men seem to be dealing the budget  a serious blow promising protection for the underprivileged.  The organizers of the news conference specially underscored  that this is a seeming contradiction because the men's  activities in drafting laws in the social sphere do not set the  aim of the "each will get an apartment" type -- this is  demagoguery. Their efforts are aimed at a just distribution of  state assistance so that "a one-room family with two children,  two domestic servants and two Volvo cars could buy an apartment  rather than wait for municipal housing."    A smart plan. Unfortunately, such social policy leads to the  need to withdraw benefits from those who undeservedly enjoy them  -- like the above-mentioned family or that same family of Robert  Kennedy -- and it is common knowledge that we like to get  benefits and hate to give them back. On the other hand, voters  who enjoy "dishonest" benefits may not make up Mr. Gaydar's  electorate after all. At any rate, the journalists were made to  understand that unpopular measures are not something he has to  come to terms with.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] We have just received a message faxed to us by the  Shipyard Workers' Trade Union Federation -- FESINAR Constanta,  announcing that the strike over an unlimited period of time,  which began yesterday at the Constanta Shipyard, was terminated  today at 1030 [0730 GMT] after agreement was reached on the last  point on the list of demands of the shipyard workers' trade  union.    The collective labor conflict, which began on 1 June, will  be  considered as concluded only after the things agreed upon by the  trade union and the employer take concrete shape according to  the time schedule established during the negotiations.    A copy of the agreement, which was also faxed to us,  stipulates, among other things, a 35-percent increase in  salaries beginning with the month of June, calculated on the  basis of the 1994 May salaries, as well as a 75-percent increase  of the salaries beginning with the month of July, calculated on  the basis of the 1994 May salaries. The aforementioned  percentage also including the various indexations granted by the  government over the third term of the year.

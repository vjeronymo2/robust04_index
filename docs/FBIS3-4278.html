			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Wu Fei (0702 2431): "Shanghai Issues </F> Certificates to Manage Migrant Laborers; 400,000 People Apply  for 'Labor Certificates'"]    [Text] Shanghai, 20 Mar (WEN WEI PO)--The department  concerned of Shanghai Municipal Government will soon issue  "labor certificates" to over 430,000 laborers from other  provinces, and the more than 20,000 laborers from other  provinces who have received "labor certificates" welcomed this  measure. Shanghai is now actively seeking a better way to solve  various problems caused by the increasing inflow of a migrant  population. In 1993, about 2.81 million people came from other  provinces to Shanghai, and 74.3 percent of these people came to  seek jobs or do business. People at working ages of 21 to 59  accounted for 85.3 percent, and construction workers numbered  760,000.    In the past few years, the inflow of the huge migrant  population caused many problems for Shanghai. In particular,  before and after the Chinese New Year, the huge tide of migrant  laborers put heavy pressure on the railway, public security,  labor, and urban transport departments. Urban residents also  complained about the consequent inconvenience. On one hand,  there were a lot of construction projects and commercial  undertakings in Shanghai, and they needed a large external labor  force; on the other hand, the inflow of millions of external  laborers also caused difficulties and problems for city  management.    In late 1993, the public security, civil affairs, railway,  industrial and commercial administrative, comprehensive  management, and labor departments of the municipal government  jointly set up a new organ for managing the external population.  It then adopted a number of management measures. Recently,  when the department concerned issued "labor certificates," it  also issued "blue card" residence certificates to professionals,  investors, and senior managerial personnel in enterprises.    Recently, this reporter visited the Shanghai Municipal  Office  for Managing the External Labor Force, which issued the "labor  certificates" to external laborers in Shanghai. Shen Zhiwei,  deputy director of the office told this reporter that "labor  certificates" were mainly issued to workers employed by Shanghai  enterprises from other localities. The employing institutions  included state-owned and collective enterprises, joint-stock  companies, private enterprises, and individual businesses. The  management office would examine the employment applications and  labor contracts submitted by the employing institutions in order  to prevent their paying wages lower than the standards to  workers from other localities. The issuance of "labor  certificates" would enable external workers to achieve legal  working status so their legitimate working rights and interests  can be guaranteed. At the same time, this would also enable the  public security and labor departments to more effectively  exercise management within their jurisdiction. In addition, the  issuance of "labor certificates" may play a role in curbing the  inflow of migrant laborers. Because migrant laborers have told  each other about the new measure, they may be discouraged from  pouring into the city before they can find jobs. At present,  "labor certificates" have not been issued to construction  workers, household assistants, and scattered odd-job workers.  The department concerned is now considering the method of  managing such people. Now, some 430,000 people have applied for  "labor certificates," and the number of applicants will continue  to increase. The official expected that the work of issuing  this year's labor certificates would be completed by May.    According to the people concerned, along with the  development  of Shanghai's construction and the expansion of the urban area,  a large external population will continue to flow into Shanghai  for a long time in the future. The adoption of a series of  measures indicate that Shanghai has taken the initiative in  exercising effective management over the external migrant  population in the city.</p>

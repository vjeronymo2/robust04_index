			<p>910415 FT  15 APR 91 / US regulator investigates Microsoft THE US Federal Trade Commission is investigating Microsoft, the world's largest software company, in a wide-ranging anti-trust inquiry. Microsoft said it had been told that the FTC would examine third-party allegations that Microsoft 'has monopolised or has attempted to monopolise the market for operating systems, operating environments, computer software and computer peripherals for personal computers'. The company supplies the DOS personal computer operating system used in all IBM-compatible personal computers. Microsoft is also the largest supplier of applications software for personal computers. The group's long-standing ties with IBM have given it a pivotal role in the personal computer industry. If Microsoft is found to have violated anti-trust laws, as some competitors privately charge, the outcome is likely to have a broad impact throughout the computer industry. Previously, Microsoft had understood the investigation to be narrowly focused on a 1989 joint statement with IBM in which the companies were alleged to have agreed to limit the functionality of Windows, a Microsoft personal computer programme. Mr William Neukom, Microsoft vice-president of law and corporate affairs, said: 'Microsoft is surprised and disappointed that the inquiry has been broadened. 'We will continue to co-operate with this investigation,' added. 'We believe that Microsoft has acted in a legal and ethical manner.' The FTC, which is charged with investigating business practices that restrict competition, declined to comment on the existence of the inquiry, or its nature. Microsoft's share price fell from a Thursday close of Dollars 111 to trade at Dollars 106 1/2 on news of the investigation by the Federal Trade Commission.</p>

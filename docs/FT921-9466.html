			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / Battling against a basket of troubles Last week, Mr Bob Willett, chief executive of Gateway Foodmarkets, the UK supermarket group, addressed a food retailing conference in London. He depicted the Gateway business as valiantly battling its way back into prosperity. He even criticised the 'flawed' trading strategy of his bigger rivals, which he said were overpaying for sites in their quest to open new space. Yesterday, a rather different aura surrounded Gateway as Usdaw, the shopworkers' union, attacked the company's plans to shake-up its labour force. The furore of the job cuts, coupled with last Friday's departure of two directors from Gateway, set the City talking about a flare-up of disruption at the company reminiscent of the departure of Mr David Smith and Ms Elizabeth Hignell as directors of the Isosceles parent company last September. These developments compounded the bad news of the previous month when Gateway said its sales had suffered severely in the recession. The company yesterday admitted it had seen no easing of those pressures in the weeks that have followed. Some City observers have begun to wonder whether Isosceles, which took Gateway private in a Pounds 2.1bn debt-heavy deal in 1989, will be able to achieve its declared aim of returning to the market within one to three years. Any delay would only add to the discomfort of Wasserstein, Perella, the Wall Street leveraged buy-out specialist which owns 40 per cent of Isosceles' equity. The stake accounts for about one-third of the firm's investment portfolio. Others observers have questioned if Gateway has a future at all or whether it will fall victim to the voracious appetites of its high-spending rivals. Although such fears are easily exaggerated, Gateway is indeed looking perilously exposed. Its Isosceles parent company is still saddled with Pounds 1.3bn of borrowings and has been unable to complete the desperately-needed disposal of Herman's, its US sportswear subsidiary. Gateway itself is strapped for cash and struggling to make sense of its portfolio of 682 small stores which have been starved of investment for years and which have seen their trading position eroded by competitors opening superstores. 'Gateway has got a lot of very vulnerable real estate out there but food retailing is an odd industry. Companies do not go 'phut' overnight and fascias can change,' said one analyst. Mr Willett has undoubtedly done much to shake up the sleepy Gateway culture and he has worked hard to give the company a viable strategy for the future. In the two years he has headed Gateway, Mr Willett has ruthlessly cut head-office costs and swathes of management. He has introduced a range of 900 own-label products and a programme of cultural change. He has recruited about 150 'aggressive' executives in the past 18 months and 100 new store managers since Christmas. His response to what he sees as a segmenting food retailing market has been to launch two new formats in an attempt to seize market share. The group has researched a new style of high-quality high street stores  - called Somerfield - which ideally trade in market towns. The group has rolled out 14 of these stores but is accelerating the process: by April a further 13 will have been added. By the end of the year the company aims to have 50 stores with 1m sq ft of trading space. The response to these stores has been encouraging with an average basket sale of Pounds 16.30 compared with Pounds 8.80 at the core Gateway stores. Gateway has also launched a chain of 15 Food Giant discount superstores, which sell 10,000 lines including many fresh products. The concept of Food Giant was originally a matter of expedience. Although Gateway sold 61 superstores to Asda for Pounds 705m in 1989 it was left with a rump of 14 underperforming superstores which 'were an unmitigated disaster', according to Mr Willett. But it is believed that Gateway now has bigger ambitions and has developed plans to open 26 Food Giant stores by April 1994 looking at sites previously owned by Lowndes Queensway, the failed furniture retailer. But in spite of Mr Willett's efforts, there remain doubts about his room for manoeuvre. 'Gateway has got a capital budget of Pounds 100m a year and that is a severe constraint on the scale of its aspirations,' says Mr Tony MacNeary, food retailing analyst at County NatWest. Last week, Mr Willett said: 'The market is polarising and will become very difficult for weak and non-focused retailers.' Many industry observers agree; but they place Gateway firmly in the category of the weak.</p>

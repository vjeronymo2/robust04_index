			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / Newsprint chief warns prices may rise 30% Prices for newsprint are likely to rise by a further 15 per cent next year on top of the 15 per cent already signalled for January, according to the head of the UK's biggest plant. Mr Ramsay Hampton, chief executive of Aylesford Newsprint, a joint venture between SCA, the Swedish forestry group, and Mondi, the European paper company, said the additional increase 'would only get us back to the level of nominal selling prices in 1989' after the deep recession from which the paper industry was only now recovering. He said: 'We are negotiating with the newspaper proprietors and they are never very happy to accept price increases, but I think they do remember where the prices have come from. Paper makers have been under extreme cost pressure for many years.' Aylesford Newsprint has invested Pounds 250m in building Europe's biggest 100-per-cent-recycled newsprint mill in Kent, which will be up and running by June next year. The attraction of recycling waste paper has improved considerably over the past year after virgin pulp prices doubled, pushing waste paper prices up by 100 per cent in Europe. Aylesford has started running its combined heat and power plant at the site and will commission the water and effluent treatment facility before the end of the year. The new paper machine will have the capacity to produce 280,000 tonnes of newsprint a year, mainly for the UK market, which is 70 per cent supplied by imports. This brings the capacity of the plant to 370,000 tonnes. Aylesford is one of the first newsprint mills to use recycled paper as its only raw material - most newsprint producers use a mix of recycled and virgin material. The company has approached hundreds of local authorities to set up the country's biggest collection scheme for waste paper. It plans to have 5,000 collection banks in place by June at a total cost of between Pounds 3m and Pounds 5m. Mr Hampton said the used newspaper and magazine banks will supply 60 per cent to 65 per cent of the plant's needs. If the recycling effort is successful, Aylesford expects to double its capacity. The market has turned from one in which paper merchants were virtually paying companies to take waste material away to one where they are pushing through large price rises. Mr Hampton said: 'The problem in the UK was that there were few outlets for recycling waste paper and suddenly the collection system was bigger than the capacity for using it. We want to interest people in collecting it again as we can provide an assured outlet.' SCA and Mondi, part of the Minorco group, joined forces a year ago to chase investment in Europe in the recycled sector.</p>

			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / Indian investigators parade Bombay terror blast suspect on TV Indian investigators examining last year's Bombay terrorist bomb attacks last night paraded one of their prime suspects on national television. The move gave India an opportunity to highlight its claims that Pakistan helped to organise the blasts in which over 250 people were killed and 1,200 injured. It seems certain further to damage relations between the two countries, which see each other as their worst enemies. Mr Yakub Memon talked at length on last night's programme about his alleged role in the blasts and the support he allegedly received from Pakistan's secret service, Inter Services Intelligence. Born and having grown up in Bombay, Mr Memon, 33, fled the city after the explosions together with his brother, Mr Tiger Memon, and their families, and secretly sought refuge in Pakistan. He was arrested a few days ago in mysterious circumstances. The Indian police say he was captured at Delhi railway station last Friday. But Mr Memon has said he was detained on July 24 in Kathmandu and taken across the border into India. Since his arrest, Mr Memon has allegedly provided his interrogators with 'a rich harvest', according to officials of the Central Bureau of Investigation. As well as giving details of the bombings, he has named a Karachi gangland boss as an ISI agent and the main organiser of the bombing conspiracy. Indian investigators have also claimed, through stories leaked to newspapers, that Mr Memon carried with him incriminating evidence, including a fake Pakistani passport and forged Pakistani school and university certificates, all of which were in the name of an alias. The investigators believe the documents were meant to give him a new identity after the bombings. Moreover, Mr Memon allegedly carried a video of a wedding attended by the ISI agent and a prominent Bombay underworld chief, who is also wanted by the Indian authorities in connection with the bombings. There was some incredulity in Delhi yesterday that a fugitive terrorist suspect would be travelling with so many incriminating items in his possession. Some observers believed the authorities may be exaggerating the quality of Mr Memon's evidence to create the impression that India's worst terrorist attack has finally been solved. Indian officials have from the beginning accused Pakistan of complicity in the blasts but have lacked hard evidence.</p>

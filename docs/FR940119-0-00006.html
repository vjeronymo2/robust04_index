			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Another commenter pointed out that we do not require that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demand letter inform households when recoupment would begin and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amount of benefits the household would then receive. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department believes that it would be useful to include this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information in the demand letter. Current rules at 7 CFR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 273.18(g)(4) require that prior to reduction State agencies inform  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> households about the effect of recoupment on their benefits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Consequently, the final rule provides that, unless the State agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has otherwise informed the household what its allotment would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> net of the reduction for repaying the claim, it provide that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information in the demand letter.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Current rules at 7 CFR 273.12(c)(2) provide that decreases in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> benefits must be made effective no later than the month following  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the lapse of the adverse notice period. Consistent with this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> general policy and the required timeframe for election of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> repayment method, the final rule provides that the initial demand  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> letter for IHE claims must inform the household that the reduction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will begin with the first allotment issued after the household  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> either timely elects allotment reduction or, if it fails to make a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> timely election, with the first allotment issued after the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expiration of the time for its election. Demand letters provided  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subsequent to a fair hearing sustaining an IHE claim must inform  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the household that if it fails to make a timely election, allotment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reduction will begin with the first allotment issued after timely  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notice of such election is due to the State agency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another commenter on this paragraph recommended that we be more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specific about the acceptable ways for households to communicate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their decisions about repayment. The Department is not aware of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any operational difficulties with how State agencies and households  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> currently communicate about claims collections. Current rules at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7 CFR 273.15(h) provide that requests for fair hearings may be oral  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or in writing so long as they are clear and if they are not, State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agencies may ask households for clarification. The Department  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> encourages State agencies to apply this standard to communications  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concerning elections of repayment methods. Consequently, the final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule does not specify ways households must communicate elections  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> about repayment methods.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed rule would have amended 7 CFR 273.13(b) which lists  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exemptions from notices of adverse action. As mentioned earlier in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this preamble, the proposed rule would have added situations where  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the State agency initiates allotment reduction against a household  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which has been provided notice of its appeal rights for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> underlying claim to the list of exemptions. No commenter objected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to this action or indicated the need for clarification.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Consequently, the final rule adopts the language as proposed in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7 CFR 273.13(b)(14). Several commenters did remark about an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> associated statement in the preamble which was that the claim  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> itself was the adverse action, not the collection action. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department believes that the changes in this final rule clarify  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that statement. Households are due notice of specific appeal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rights regarding claims such as how the claim arose, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information on which the claim is based, how the amount of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> claim was calculated and the right to contest the claim. Once  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those due process requirements have been met and the claim has been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> established, State agencies are expected to proceed to collection  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> activities without additional notices of adverse action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Technical Corrections to Current Rules  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department used the proposed rule to correct two errors in 7  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CFR 273.18(d)(3) of current rules which resulted from the final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Administration-Management rule published February 22, 1990 (55 FR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6233). The first correction clarified that a notice of adverse  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> action is required when a claim is not established in a fair  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hearing. It deleted the phrase which limited this requirement to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those circumstances where ``the amount of the claim'' had not been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> established. The one comment received on this matter was from a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State agency which indicated it was already in compliance with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> broader requirement. Consequently, the final rule adopts the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> language as stated in the proposed rulemaking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The second correction reinstated a provision in 7 CFR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 273.18(d)(4)(iii) allowing other methods of collecting claims for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> IHE and State agency error claims. A commenter objected on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> grounds that the law does not authorize other collection methods  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for IHE claims. However, section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Food Stamp Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of 1977 (7 U.S.C. 2022(b)(2)(B)) does authorize such collection action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for IHE claims. Accordingly, the final rule adopts the language as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stated in the proposed rulemaking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> State Agency Retention of Claims Against Households  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule would have reduced the recipient claims retention  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rate for State agencies from 50 percent to 25 percent for IPV  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> claims and from 25 percent to 10 percent for IHE claims. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed rule further specified that the new rates are effective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the period beginning October 1, 1990 and ending September 30,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1995. Beginning October 1, 1995 the old rates of 50 percent for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> IPV claims and 25 percent for IHE claims will again take effect.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed rule also would have allowed State agencies the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> opportunity to submit a one-time request for any additional amount  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> due under the old, higher retention rates by November 30, 1991.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Four comments were received on this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As explained in the proposed rule, the Department had previously  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> directed State agencies to implement the new retention rates for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reporting and payment purposes. This was done in order to comply  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the Act and to minimize the need for revised reporting on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Form FNS&hyph;209, Status of Claims Against Households. Effective with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the first quarter Fiscal Year 1991 FNS&hyph;209 report, the Department  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has been recovering funds from State agencies at the new retention  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rates in accordance with the Act. The Department had also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> previously advised State agencies of the procedure for requesting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any additional retention due on collections received prior to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> October 1, 1990 and the deadline for filing such requests.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

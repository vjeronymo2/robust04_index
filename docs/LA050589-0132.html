			<p><P> May 5, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES : LONG BEACH  </P> <P> Patricia Turnier makes paints smoky, atmospheric images. Done in modulated  egg-shell whites and neutral tones heightened to the fluffiness of storm  clouds, the works are so loose they could be images of vapor or simply abstract  fields. There's a nostalgic, romantic bent here that remains sweet and  dangerously tame.  </P> <P> Three small works collectively called "Coastal Ranges" are kept nocturnal and  moody. Crisp edging contributes a plastic and psychic tension otherwise  missing. Turnier begins to tap that ferocious sublimity that raises this sort  of work above Sunday realism.  </P> <P> Like a jolt, we move into a show of hot, red, apocalyptic abstractions by Clark  Walding. Formerly a figurative artist, Walding has retained his vigorous  gestural approach to pigment, making molten surfaces and incorporating passages  of charred wood. In "One Inside the Hall," a tiered structure embedded in an  expanse of gnarled paint suggests a ladder or shelter offering a frail handhold  in the maelstrom of a churning void. If Turnier's work lacks bite, then  Walding's -- much like Robert Morris' last fiery works on similar themes --  suffers from a bit of histrionic excess. (The Works Gallery, 106 W. 3rd St., to  May 28.) Marlena Donohue  </P></p>

			<p>920907 FT  07 SEP 92 / People: Chope's public practice Christopher Chope, a former junior minister, at the Department of Transport, has joined the management consultancy department of accountants Ernst &amp; Young. Chope, who lost his conservative parliamentary seat in Southampton at the last election, will use his knowledge of government to help expand the firm's public sector practice . He will work for Ernst &amp; Young two days a week, fostering its growing role in policy formulation and management in government organisations. Ever the politician, Chope says: 'I hope to contribute to improving business performance in the public sector and use my experience to help Ernst &amp; Young apply these ideas more effectively for the eventual benefit of the taxpayer.' Clive Williams, head of consulting, explained he had known Chope for some while. 'He is very creative and full of ideas.' Williams hopes to build public sector work from 20 per cent to 35 per cent of management consultancy fee income over the next few years.</p>

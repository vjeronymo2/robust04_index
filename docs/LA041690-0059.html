			<p><P> April 16, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PEPSICO PLANS $1.1-BILLION EXPANSION  </P> <P> Pepsico Inc., the giant food and beverage conglomerate, plans to spend $1.1  billion in 1990 to expand its worldwide business, with the biggest chunk of  cash going to its booming fast-food restaurant system.  </P> <P> In its annual report to stockholders, Pepsico said the expenditure "reflects  strategies to expand international snack food capacity, increase soft drink  vending presence worldwide and expand domestic pizza delivery operations."  </P> <P> The company said 40% of its capital spending this year will be devoted to  expanding the Kentucky Fried Chicken, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell chains, with the  rest split evenly between the Pepsi-Cola soft drink business and its Frito-Lay  and Europe-based Smiths and Walkers snack foods.  </P> <P> Pepsico is the world's biggest restaurant operator but is still best known  among U.S. consumers for its cola drinks.  </P> <P> Chairman D. Wayne Calloway said his company's focus for the new decade includes  becoming "an even stronger player on a global scale."  </P> <P> "Although we've nearly tripled our international operating profits in the past  two years, they still represent only 16% of our total," Calloway said.  </P> <P> On April 9, the Purchase, N.Y.-based company announced a complex barter deal  with Moscow aimed at doubling its bottling network in the Soviet Union. The  deal is valued at $3 billion over the next 10 years.  </P> <P> Pepsi-Cola Co. has also announced plans to begin sales in India, whose new  government recently rejected an application from Cola-Cola to re-enter a market  it left in the mid-1970s rather than reveal its top-secret cola formula.  </P></p>

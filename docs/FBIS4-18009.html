			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Yevgeniy Saburov, vice premier of the Crimea </F> government, by Vladimir Pasyakin in the "Topical Issue" column:  "Today Crimea Is Reminiscent of a Sinking Ship" -- in  Sevastopol, date not given]    [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] [Pasyakin] How is the  formation of the Crimean Cabinet of Ministers proceeding?    [Saburov] As for the government, there is one big difficulty  here. We may differ in our attitude to the "empire" but it  needs to be said that it had one very unpleasant quality: The  center worked like a vacuum cleaner. If an intelligent  specialist appeared somewhere in the provinces, he soon ended up  in Moscow. Therefore I have been confronted with the task of  attracting good cadres.    For instance, Economy Minister Andrey Vasilyevich  Chernyavskiy is one of the best forecasters in Russia. The  economic analysis he has provided throughout the entire course  of reform is valued very highly. Lyudmila Mikhaylovna Zaytseva  -- a fairly prominent Russian economist, who has dealt with  public finances -- in other words, what in socialist jargon was  called the social sphere -- has agreed to become finance  minister. [passage omitted]    [Pasyakin] How do you relate to the fact that the Ukrainian  president's representative has been sent to Crimea? After all,  his emergence means effectively the formation of a third branch  of power.    [Saburov] The current situation in Crimea is absolutely  fantastic. Elections have been held; a legitimate head of the  executive branch has been elected; and after all this a  Ukrainian presidential representative is appointed.... This is  legal nonsense. If he is the executive branch, then apparently  the results of the elections in Crimea are not recognized.    [Pasyakin] What is the situation in Crimea at present? What  is your action program for the near future?    [Saburov] Crimea is currently reminiscent of a sinking ship.  The economic reform program provides for improving financial  relations with Russia, promoting banking, elaborating an optimal  privatization program, revising the tax system, attracting  foreign investors, and so forth. But for economic reform to be  successful, a minimum favorable political climate is needed.  The complicated situation in Crimea is a serious obstacle to  reform.    [Pasyakin] Presumably, pursuing unorthodox economic reform  in Crimea calls for certain boldness?    [Saburov] We shall have to resort to unpopular measures to  lead the economy out of the deadlock. This will naturally cause  discontent. Yet they cannot be rejected for this reason only.  It is enough to recall Ludwig Erhard, the classic example of  brilliant reform in post-war Germany. Everybody criticized him  but he did not turn off his path.</p>

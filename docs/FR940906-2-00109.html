			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> I. Introduction and Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Introduction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The objective of the Federal Radiological Emergency Response Plan (FRERP)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is to establish an organized and integrated capability for timely, coordinated response by Federal agencies to peacetime radiological emergencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FRERP:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Provides the Federal Government's concept of operations based on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specific authorities for responding to radiological emergencies;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Outlines Federal policies and planning considerations on which the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concept of operations of this Plan and Federal agency specific response plans are based; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Specifies authorities and responsibilities of each Federal agency that may have a significant role in such emergencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are two Sections in this Plan. Section I contains background,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considerations, and scope. Section II describes the concept of operations for response.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Participating Federal Agencies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Each participating agency has responsibilities and/or capabilities that pertain to various types of radiological emergencies. The following Federal agencies participate in the FRERP:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Department of Agriculture (USDA),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Department of Commerce (DOC),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Department of Defense (DOD),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Department of Energy (DOE),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Department of Health and Human Services (HHS),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) Department of the Interior (DOI),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (8) Department of Justice (DOJ),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (9) Department of State (DOS),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (10) Department of Transportation (DOT),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (11) Department of Veterans Affairs (VA),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (12) Environmental Protection Agency (EPA),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (13) Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (14) General Services Administration (GSA),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (15) National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (16) National Communications System (NCS), and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (17) Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Scope  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The FRERP covers any peacetime radiological emergency that has actual,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> potential, or perceived radiological consequences within the United States, its Territories, possessions, or territorial waters and that could require a response by several Federal agencies. The level of the Federal response to a specific emergency will be based on the type and/or amount of radioactive material involved, the location of the emergency, the impact on or the potential for impact on the public and environment, and the size of the affected area. Emergencies occurring at fixed nuclear facilities or during the transportation of radioactive materials, including nuclear weapons, fall within the scope of the Plan regardless of whether the facility or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> radioactive materials are publicly or privately owned, Federally regulated, regulated by an Agreement State, or not regulated at all. (Under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 [Subsection 274.b.], the NRC has relinquished to certain States its regulatory authority for licensing the use of source, byproduct, and small quantities of special nuclear material.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. Plan Considerations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Public and Private Sector Response  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For an emergency at a fixed nuclear facility or a facility not under the control of a Federal agency, State and local governments have primary responsibility for determining and implementing measures to protect life, property, and the environment in areas outside the facility boundaries. The owner or operator of a nuclear facility has primary responsibility for actions within the boundaries of that facility, for providing notification and advice to offsite officials, and for minimizing the radiological hazard to the public.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For emergencies involving an area under Federal control, the responsibility for onsite actions belongs to a Federal agency, while offsite actions are the responsibility of the State or local government.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For all other emergencies, the State or local government has the responsibility for taking emergency actions both onsite and offsite, with support provided, upon request, by Federal agencies as designated in Section II of this plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

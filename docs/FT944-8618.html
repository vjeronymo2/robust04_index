			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Builders crumble Building materials and construction shares, one of the stock market's more visible Cinderella sectors, ran up against further negative news following disappointing interims from timber specialist Meyer International and cautious annual meeting statements from housebuilders Barratt Development and Raine. Meyer tumbled 44 to 359p. The company's interim profits fell short of analysts' estimates but it was the warning about a second-half squeeze on sales that triggered the sell-off. UBS reduced its estimate of full-year profits from Pounds 56m to Pounds 55m and, more significantly, came down to Pounds 67.5m from an earlier Pounds 72.5m for next year. Other builders merchants suffered in the backwash. Plumbing groups Wolseley and Travis Perkins fell 12 apiece to 778p and 288p respectively. In spite of a 16 per cent rise in final completions for the first four months of this year, Barratt eased 6 to 173p as the market focused on what the annual meeting had to say about generally weak housebuilding margins. Raine retreated 4 to 47p and Beazer slipped 5 to 135p.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, January 4 (XINHUA) -- Beijing's retail  value of consumer goods last year totalled 54.5 billion yuan  (over six billion U.S. dollars), up 27 percent over the previous  year.    This year was the tenth consecutive year that the capital  maintained a double-digit increase rate in the total retail  value of consumer goods.    In the past year 11 department stores and shopping centers  in  the city joined the list of big-name companies with sales  volumes exceeding 100 million yuan-worth. The total number of  such undertakings rose from less than half a dozen only a few  years ago to 26 by the end of last year.    According to a survey, the combined sales volume of 120  major  companies (0.08 percent of the total number of enterprises in  Beijing) in the sectors of general merchandise, electrical  appliances, cultural goods, clothing and foodstuffs made up for  20 percent of the city's total last year.    Experts attributed the surge in sales volume to the reform  measures coupled with the drive for the establishment of a  market economy as well as to robust purchasing power and an  ample supply of goods.    Major reform measures put into effect by the Beijing  municipality last year ranged from lifting price controls on  grain and edible oil to introducing the share-holding system to  more companies. As a result, over 6,000 small firms expanded  their business last year.    They said such reforms have ended the monopoly of  state-owned  enterprises in the retail sector. Collective, individual,  private and joint ventures are playing increasingly important  roles and have helped to turn Beijing into the largest commodity  distribution center in north China.    The sales volume of the city's non-state-owned commercial  enterprises last year accounted for 61 percent of the total  figure.</p>

			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / The Coal White Paper: Ground is laid for full privatisation BRITISH Coal has been told to prepare for full privatisation. The government intends to sell all British Coal's commercial operations to the private-sector, and is proposing a new form of regulatory structure. A bill is expected in the next session of parliament beginning in the autumn. The crucial element will be separation of the regulatory and mining functions of British Coal to remove the potentially serious conflict of interest which could arise from British Coal licensing competitors. A new public body, the Coal Authority, will be responsible for licensing all coal mining activity. The authority, which will be prohibited from mining, will have its headquarters in Nottinghamshire. The white paper says there are clear benefits to the coal industry and to consumers in freeing the industry's managers from the constraints of public-sector ownership. 'It is to a large extent these constraints that have brought British Coal to its present position, and there can be no confidence that within them the industry will achieve the dramatic changes necessary if it is to have a long-term future,' it says. The government wants transfers to the private sector to be implemented as quickly as possible once the legislation is passed. British Coal will also be prepared to consider proposals for the sale of regional coal mining packages as well as the sale of individual pits. The white paper view that there were considerable attractions to giving private-sector mining companies the opportunity to run pits that would otherwise close was welcomed warmly, though cautiously, by the companies. Many private mining groups were enthusiastic. Mr Richard Budge, chairman of RJB Mining, which operates two deep coal mines in north-west England, said it was a 'very balanced result' which would give subsidies to both the public and private sectors. He said of privatisation: 'It's not a question of cutting wages - it's a change of culture that matters. With the commitment of our workers it would be bound to be a success.' Mr Malcolm Edwards, former British Coal marketing director who hopes to lead a consortium to licence up to four mines in the Yorkshire region, said coal buyers would warmly welcome alternative suppliers of UK coal, as British Coal had not always been able to supply some specialised markets. 'We can't make an immediate commitment - we are miles from that. All we can do is express a genuine commercial interest and say what could be done.' Hanson, one of the companies most frequently named as a potential buyer, was particularly cautious. All a spokesman would say was: 'Until we have more information it is difficult for us to reach any decision, so we do not register interest or disinterest until details are clearer.'</p>

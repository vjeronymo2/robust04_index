			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / UK Company News: CRH declines by 25% to IPounds 62.6m as recession bites THE RECESSION has finally caught up with CRH, the international building materials group and one of Ireland's biggest companies. The group yesterday announced that pre-tax profits last year fell by a quarter from IPounds 83.5m to IPounds 62.6m (Pounds 58.1m). However, the figures, accompanied by a 7.5 per cent dividend increase, will be better than most UK building materials companies will announce during the next few weeks. The group has already paid a second interim dividend, in lieu of a final, of 4.3p making a total of 6.45p (6p), which is covered 2.7 times by earnings of 17.46p (23.2p) per share. This comes at a time when some large construction groups will be able only to maintain dividend payments by dipping into reserves. Mr Tony Barry, chief executive, said that the group's resilience had been due to the broad geographical spread of its businesses divided evenly between the Republic of Ireland, the UK, continental Europe and the US. Even so last year was difficult for the group as European and US construction markets came under pressure. Operating profits fell in all four divisions as turnover declined by 6 per cent from IPounds 1.22bn to Pounds 1.15bn. The biggest falls were in the UK where profits tumbled by 72 per cent to just IPounds 4.36m (IPounds 15.4m) and in the US where profits fell 29 per cent to IPounds 13.6m. The UK's contribution to group operating profits has fallen from about 25 per cent three years ago to 5 per cent last year. Irish profits, affected by lower domestic construction and reduced exports to a depressed UK market, fell by 5 per cent from IPounds 42.6m to IPounds 36m. Continental European profits fell by just 3.1 per cent to Pounds 30.1m helped by a strong performance from recent German purchases. Profits in Spain and the Netherlands, however, dipped slightly. Mr Barry warned that this year was likely to be just as difficult with construction output forecast to fall further in many of the countries in which the group operates. Nonetheless, it was continuing to generate a positive cashflow and its balance sheet was secure. Gearing, including convertible capital bonds as debt, fell from 51 per cent to 37 per cent by end-December. If the bonds were classed as equity gearing fell from 14 per cent to 5 per cent, Mr Barry said. COMMENT The recession is really biting if a company with CRH's spread of businesses is starting to feel the pinch. This year does not look like being much better than the last two. Few building material companies, however, are as in good a shape as CRH, illustrated by the group's IPounds 41m positive cashflow last year. A similar position is likely in the current year when pre-tax profits may be a same again IPounds 62m. This would put the group on a p/e of 13 which looks cheap given the quality of the businesses and the balance sheet. The stock (perhaps because it is Dublin-based) has traditionally traded at a discount to the sector. It deserves better. CRH's figures, accompanied by a 7.5 per cent dividend increase, will be better than most UK building materials companies will announce during the next few weeks.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Sian Clare, PRESS ASSOCIATION lobby correspondent] </F>   [Text] The prospect of air strikes on Serb positions around  Sarajevo now seemed more remote thanks to Russia, Foreign  Secretary Douglas Hurd said tonight.    An immediate threat of a breakdown in the ceasefire  retreated  when the leader of the Bosnian Serbs said his forces would  withdraw their heavy weapons from Sarajevo after Russia pledged  to provide 400 peacekeeping troops in the area.    NATO has threatened air strikes against any artillery or  heavy weapons around the Bosnian capital unless they are  withdrawn at least 12 miles from the city or surrendered to the  United Nations by midnight on Sunday [20 February].    Mr. Hurd said of the Russian move: "This fits in admirably  with the NATO initiative. They sit well together and if this  works on the ground, there is now a much better chance than  before of avoiding air strikes because the heavy weapons will  have been withdrawn or controlled."    He told reporters in London: "If things turn out right on  the  ground, there will be a huge advance...but of course what counts  is what happens not what is said."    If there were "no significant shelling" by the time the  deadline lapses on Sunday and the heavy weapons had been  withdrawn or put under control, there would be "no need for air  strikes."    But he warned that the air strikes would go ahead if the UN  terms were not met.    He said: "There is now a real prospect of a nightmare coming  to an end."    Asked if the war in Sarajevo was about to end, he said:  "There is a chance because of the NATO initiative, because of  the way the troop contributors, including Britain, have  responded and now because of the way the Russians have brought  themselves back into the peace protest [as received] -- there is  a chance of that."    Mr. Hurd said he and the Prime Minister had been told during  their trip to Russia this week that Moscow was willing to put in  troops under the United Nations.    Mr. Hurd, speaking outside his official residence in Carlton  Gardens, said he and the Prime Minister had "spent hours"  discussing the possibility of the Russians putting in troops  when they met Russian President Boris Yeltsin and his ministers  earlier this week.    He had spoken to the American Secretary of State Warren  Christopher and the French, German and Italian foreign ministers  today by telephone about the importance of getting the Russians  back into the peace process.    "I think they felt a bit left out in the last two or three  weeks. But I hope that is put right now," he said.    "Russia is very much part of the answer to the Bosnian  crisis. When the Prime Minister and I were in Moscow we urged  the Russians to do all they could to get the Serbs into the  right action and I'm delighted they've done so apparently to  good effect," he said.</p>

			<p>920530 FT  30 MAY 92 / Arts: The Ghost Sonata THIS is one of Strindberg's last and maddest pieces, the fourth of the five 'chamber plays' he wrote for his own Intimate Theatre between 1907 and 1909. It is brave of the Sturdy Beggars company to take a shot at it. As with virtually every Strindberg opus from A Dream Play (1901) onward, it sets its players a fearful challenge: to sustain all the near-hysterical intensity of his earlier plays, but without their dramatic springboards in intimately cruel relationships. Where the principals in earlier Strindberg are so deeply embattled that we can't help but respond and blench, the characters in the late plays are like lonely asteroids. They are scarred, and by each other, but from long past; now they revolve in their private griefs, and their interactions are only formal and backward-looking - much as in late Ibsen. Strindberg imagined them as finding their own paths toward disillusioned, body-hating 'mystical' wisdom, much as in Schopenhauer. Except for the innocent (and under-written) young lovers, everybody in The Ghost Sonata is soon unmasked as ferally driven and monstrous, but their dramatic exchanges amount to little more than Gilbert and Sullivan-style revelations: who actually fathered whom, who is guilty of which fraudulent pretensions. I doubt The Ghost Sonata can be played at full value now to audiences inured to 'black comedy'. We ought to be continually jolted as the decorous disguises are torn away and the tortured grotesques expose themselves. Instead we snigger knowingly, and don't recognise anything like spiritual anguish among these venomous cartoon-creatures. In Jonas Finlay's production, a gratuitous prologue displays the entire company mopping, mowing and gibbering in slow motion. Creepily effective; but by revealing that these people are obsessive loonies, it devalues anything that they may come to feel later. It pre-empts Strindberg's intended development from a chance encounter, slightly odd but ordinary, to psychic vampirism and convulsive guilt. Within the chosen terms, everyone in this lively company has something weird to contribute. Yet a twitching Charles Addams Family is no substitute for an agonised Strindberg crew; and besides, the play affords too little room for their sour antics to be funny in their own right, whilst crying out vainly for its own note of real desperation. Joe Orton and The Rocky Horror Show are all too comfortingly near, when we should not be thinking of them at all. New End Theatre, London NW3, to 21 June</p>

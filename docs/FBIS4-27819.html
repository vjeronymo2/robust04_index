			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Yun Pyong-son: "Reflex of a Ruling Crisis"] </F>   [Text] According to reports, traitor Kim Yong-sam ordered  the entire Army and police to be put on a special and emergency  alert beginning 31 May due to his overseas trip. Those who are  called major commanders, accordingly, assumed a 24-hour  standing-by posture at communication stations and the entire  puppet Armed Forces assumed a combat posture. Also, the police  are even more frenzied in fascist oppression.    This is an intolerable criminal act aimed at further  aggravating tensions by raising an outcry over us.    The puppets are talking as if these measures were needed  because of someone's possible southward invasion, but this is a  preposterous sophistry that cannot convince anybody.    As everyone knows, there is no threat of a southward  invasion  on the Korean peninsula. The puppets have been advertising a  threat of southward invasion for the past scores of years, but  it has never existed. This is demonstrated well by the many  peace proposals we put forward and the fact that the South side  was urged to accede to the proposal for a national meeting  without hesitation at the conference of the government,  political parties, and social organizations of the Republic  recently held in Pyongyang.    In fact, there is no southward invasion, but only a threat  of  a northward invasion posed by the U.S. imperialists and their  puppet Kim Yong-sam group exists on the Korean peninsula. This  is admitted [kongin] by the world.    The U.S. imperialists are openly saying that they are ready  for a war [chongjaengdo pulsa hageddago], mobilizing large scale  updated war equipment and troops on and around the Korean  peninsula over our so-called nuclear issue. The puppet Armed  Forces have assumed a mobilization posture so as to immediately  begin a war upon receiving an order. They also conduct  large-scale joint landing operations aimed at a northward  invasion and conduct frequent exercises to pass through the  Military Demarcation Line. All these facts clearly show who is  actually aggravating tensions and increasing the danger of  invasion on the Korean peninsula.    The puppets' outcry over us is nothing but a ruse for  deceiving [kiman] public opinion at home and abroad and for  justifying their war commotion for a northward invasion.    Why then are South Korean puppets making a stir with a  special and emergency alert order for the entire puppet Army and  police? This is because their aim is to bolster [kochwi] the  South Korean people's sense of confrontation [taegyol uisik],  with the puppet traitor's overseas trip as momentum, and at  frazzling [hanchung to kinjangsikyoso] the situation aggravated  by themselves and driving it to a war phase.    This is proved by the following facts: Kim Yong-sam called a  security-related ministers meeting a few days ago and made very  belligerent outbursts [hojonjok pogon] that a 24-hour alert  posture should be assumed, that the South Korean-U.S. joint  alert posture should be strengthened, and so on. In his  so-called statement addressed to the people that followed the  meeting, he loudly talked about the need for the people to have  a firm security sense and security posture.    This is not the only aim the puppets are pursuing. Traitor  Kim Yong-sam has begun an overseas trip, but he feels uneasy.  As everyone knows, South Korean people of various classes and  strata are waging a large-scale struggle against the  agricultural market opening, the antiwar and antinuclear  struggle, the wage struggle, and the struggle for the  fatherland's reunification all over the country.    As the South Korean economy has been ruined by businesses  going bankrupt and inflation, the mummers of grievance of the  people who are disenchanted [hwanmyorul nuggin] by the Kim  Yong-sam regime is ringing all over the country. Thus, the  puppets are suffering a serious ruling crisis [simgakhan tongchi  wigi].    Although traitor Kim Yong-sam is visiting overseas, no one  knows what will happen in South Korea at any point. Traitor Kim  Yong-sam's special and emergency alert order reflects this shaky  situation [iron puransuroun chojiui panyonguroso] and it is also  aimed at maintaining power by oppressing opposition forces  [pandaepa seryok] with weapons [chongkallo] and by diverting the  people's attention with other things.    However, this is worthless. Aggravating North-South  relations and threatening the people with weapons will only  result in accelerating self-ruin.    The South Korean people will never leave the Kim Yong-sam  group, which makes treachery to the country and the nation its  business, as it is [maeguk paejok haengwirul ilsamnun kim  yong-sam iltangul choltaero kamanduji anulgosimnida].</p>

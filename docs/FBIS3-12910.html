He stressed that the ministers will  discuss the direct and indirect boycott and make the appropriate  decision on the issue.    In a telephone conversation with AL-DUSTUR yesterday, Dr.  'Abd-al-Majid said that the ministers will also discuss amending  the Arab League Charter by introducing supplements to bring it  in line with the current circumstances, changes, and  developments.    Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid said that the Arab League seeks with all  its efforts and capabilities to achieve Arab reconciliation, and  overcome the repercussions the Arab nation experiences in the  wake of the Gulf crisis by raising the slogan of frankness  before reconciliation.    Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid said that he summoned the representatives  of the UN Security Council permanent and nonpermanent members to  inform them about the Arab League denunciation and condemnation  of the massacre in the blessed Irahimi Mosque, and asked them to  appeal to their countries and governments to take steps to  immediately have the UN Security Council issue a resolution  condemning the massacre and providing protection for the  Palestinians.    Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid said that Major General Sa'id Bayraqdar,  Arab League assistant secretary general, and head of the Arab  League mission to Yemen, phoned him yesterday to brief him on  the efforts he is undertaking to settle the Yemeni crisis.    Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid said that Maj Gen Bayraqdar will leave for  Aden today, Monday to meet Vice President 'ali Salim al-Bid,  after which he will return to Sanaa to meet with Yemeni  President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih to exchange views on how to  settle the differences between the Yemeni brothers.</p>

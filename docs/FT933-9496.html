			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / World Trade News: Treuhand team hunts for export niches in the east - Trade across Europe THE Treuhand agency charged with restructuring and privatising east German industry is using countertrade and joint ventures to stimulate exports between east German enterprises and former Soviet republics. Prior to June 1990 trade between the former Soviet Union and east Germany totalled DM30bn (Pounds 11.6bn). But monetary union in Germany virtually destroyed the east's trade with Russia and the countries of eastern Europe. In an attempt to tap the export potential of some east German companies which once had close links with the Soviet Union, the Treuhand has set up a team to find markets. Mr Hero Brahms, vice-chairman of the Treuhand, says: 'Under normal conditions it would be the company's task to find export possibilities. But because of the situation in eastern Germany, we are trying to support east German companies in finding. . . creative solutions which have export possibilities, irrespective of financial problems.' Mr Brahms hopes the former Soviet republics will be able to buy east German products worth DM1m in the short term, while in the long term barter deals could amount to DM1bn. The barter deals carry a high risk partly because of the acute shortage of hard currency in the former Soviet republics and the vulnerability of the east German economy. 'These creative solutions cannot go on forever. They are temporary. But we have to support companies if we believe they can survive,' Mr Brahms says. Officials at Hermes, Germany's export credit insurance agency, yesterday said there was little point in backing countertrade if, after six months, an east German company faced liquidation. 'Dealing with Russia entails a high risk,' said Mr Hans Janus, a Hermes official. Last weekend's decision by the federal economics ministry to cut off all Hermes support to Russia, because of delays in outstanding interest payments of DM500m, confirms this view. It may also affect the fledgling revival of barter between east Germany and Russia. Last year the agency imposed a ceiling of DM5bn on credit guarantees, but gave priority to east German exporters.</p>

			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Moscow ITAR-TASS World Service in  Russian at 1755 GMT on 14 June reports that Ivan Rybkin,  chairman of the Russian State Duma told the visiting British  member of parliament Sir Nicholas Bonsor, chairman of the  Commons defense committee, that currently the topmost task was  to adopt the federal budget for the current year, ITAR-TASS  said, quoting Rybkin as having said that "the principle of  sensible sufficiency" ought to underpin defense spending in  Russia.    Cooperation between both parliaments, world ecology, the  stockpiling of nuclear arms, and the proliferation of nuclear  technologies were discussed, ITAR-TASS said. Rybkin says that  NATO's Partnership for Peace program was "a bit restricting for  Russia."    Collective security in Russia was also discussed, with the  Duma's Defense Committee Chairman Sergey Yushenkov in the chair.  Despite the end of the cold war, it was impossible to prevent  conflicts in the former Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union, he  said. Partnership for peace and Russia's participation in  peacemaking missions were also discussed.    British members of parliament were told that Russia was  concerned about its servicemen having to protect the CIS borders  in what was a legally unclear area. "While analyzing the  political and military aspects of the situation in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, the British members of parliament expressed  the hope that democracy in Russia `works long-term,'" ITAR-TASS  said.</p>

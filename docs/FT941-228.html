			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / Brussels to draft works directive The months of dialogue between unions and employers at European level in search of agreement on the establishment of works councils in European multinationals finally broke down yesterday. With voluntary agreement between the social partners ruled out, the European Commission will now proceed with a works council directive which is likely to be passed at the end of the year. The directive will require at least one meeting a year between employer representatives and top management of a company to discuss investment, production plans and redundancies. It is is likely to affect about 1,000 companies in Europe and become law in most countries in 1996 or 1997. Works councils have been a matter of controversy between European unions and employers for more than 20 years, with employers insisting that the form of consultation should be left to companies. It had been hoped that a voluntary agreement between Unice, the European employers' body, and the European Trades Union Congress, might be possible, especially after Unice shifted towards the ETUC position by accepting the principle of a legal right to information for employees. But yesterday ETUC said that the withdrawal from the negotiations of the Confederation of British Industry, the main British employers' body, had undermined Unice's negotiating authority. The CBI was unhappy about the earlier concessions that Unice made. Mr John Monks, general secretary of the British TUC, one of the main affiliates of the ETUC, said: 'What the employers have now done is make a directive on this inevitable.' The directive is likely to be passed under the German presidency later this year, but will not become law for another two years at least. It will not directly affect the UK as works councils are covered by Britain's opt-out from the Maastricht Treaty. However, it is estimated that at least 100 UK companies will be affected through their continental European subsidiaries and most of them are likely to include their UK employees. Elsewhere, the directive will affect companies with more than 1,000 employees operating in a minimum of two EU countries and with a minimum of 100 in one of the countries. The directive will provide for voluntary arrangements within companies but will have a fall-back statutory model.</p>

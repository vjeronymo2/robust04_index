			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / China snubs UK minister Prospects for a smooth transition by Hong Kong to Chinese control in 1997 dimmed at the weekend when the goodwill visit to Beijing of a UK Foreign Office minister, Mr Alistair Goodlad, ended in debacle. China refused to let Mr Goodlad visit the mainland's top official responsible for Hong Kong affairs, Mr Lu Ping, in the third snub to Mr Goodlad during his visit. The visit to Mr Lu, director of the Hong Kong and Macau Office, would have given the UK an opportunity to suggest new approaches to the long list of technical issues - including financing of Hong Kong's new airport and Chinese ratification of a raft of treaties and laws on such essential matters as air safety and the validity of business contracts - which the UK wants sorted out before the handover. Instead, Mr Goodlad tried to convince Hong Kong journalists that his visit had been 'most useful' and that relevant issues had been discussed thoroughly and courteously with other Chinese officials. After the press conference, China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a terse statement suggesting that the meeting was 'not necessary' because of the Sino-British dispute over Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten's programme of political reform. On Friday, Mr Goodlad had made a public appeal to China that the two countries should put this dispute behind them and get on with other unresolved issues. Two hours later, Mr Qian Qichen, China's foreign minister, rejected this plea, in a stinging snub delivered as they met.</p>

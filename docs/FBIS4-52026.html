			<p>BFN     [Text] At the East-West economic, industry and trade  ministers' conference opening in Poland on 6 May, Minister of  International Trade and Industry [MITI] Eijiro Hata is set to  announce that Japan will resume underwriting insurance on trade  with Poland. This was revealed by a MITI source on 3 May.    Trade between Japan and Poland has been slow since  underwriting of trade insurance was suspended three years ago.  By reviving the trade insurance, the minister wants to show  that Japan's willingness to assist East Europe in their efforts  to develop market economies has not changed.    MITI has decided to resume underwriting insurance in the  belief that Poland has come out of its economic worst and the  risk of doing trade with the country has decreased. The  ministry does not intend to set ceilings on the amounts of  insurance to be underwritten.</p>

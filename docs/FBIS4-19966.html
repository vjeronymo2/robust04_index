			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Mild Recession in Austria"] </F>   [Text] Vienna -- Austria overcame the international  recession in 1993 more effectively than neighboring countries,  the Economic Research Institute (Wifo) reported yesterday. At  0.3 percent, GNP dropped much less than that of western Germany  (1.9 percent).    Austrian industry reacted quickly to the declining orders  from abroad. It reduced production by 3 percent and investments  by one-fifth. A total of 6.5 percent of all jobs were lost in  industry in 1993. Consumption and the construction industry had  a stabilizing effect.    The recession left clear traces in the budget, however: At  98 billion schillings, the budget deficit was twice as high as  planned.</p>

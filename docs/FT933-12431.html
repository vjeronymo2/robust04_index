			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / France and Germany buy time in fight to boost franc FRANCE and Germany yesterday bought time in their battle to keep the French franc in the European exchange rate mechanism but there was no sign of an early end to the crisis in Europe's currency markets. Intervention, verbal support and an increase in the French central bank's overnight lending rate to 10 per cent from 7.75 per cent were used to keep the franc from falling to its FFr3.4305 floor against the D-Mark. Other recently embattled ERM currencies saw a similar easing of pressure. The Spanish peseta closed slightly up and the Portuguese escudo held its own. But although the French currency closed at FFr3.416, a little stronger than Thursday's close of FFr3.419, dealers and currency market analysts predicted that the tensions would reappear next week in the run-up to a meeting on Thursday of the Bundesbank's decision-making central council. In late trading in New York the franc fell back slightly to around FFr3.4177. In a rerun of moves earlier this year to deter speculation, the French and German governments and the two countries' central banks 'reaffirmed' that the parity between the D-Mark and the franc was 'fully in line with economic fundamentals'. They also sold D-Marks for francs in line with a pledge to 'continue to co-operate' according to the rules of the ERM, although on a smaller scale than Thursday. Their message was reinforced by Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, who said in Morocco that there would be no franc devaluation. However, currency market operators reacted with scepticism and insisted that there would be no peace in the system unless the Bundesbank cut its interest rates by as much as 1 percentage point next week. 'I would judge that about 65 per cent to 70 per cent of our corporate customers and investors think that the ERM is beyond the point of no return,' said Mr Rob Loewy, head of currencies at Midland Global Markets in London.

			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / International Company News: New interest in Qantas sell-off AUSTRALIAN Airlines, the government-owned domestic airline, said yesterday it might bid for a stake in Qantas Airways, the international carrier being partly privatised by the federal government. Mr John Schaap, chief executive, told staff the board had registered an interest in Qantas, but would decide later whether to bid for all or part of the 49 per cent stake to be sold by the government. Qantas said this week it was considering bidding for a stake in Australian, which will be 100 per cent privatised as part of the government's deregulation of the aviation industry. Mr Schaap said Australian planned to build on its strong position in the domestic market, in which it competes with Ansett Australia, the privately-run airline owned by TNT and News Corporation. He said the airline was looking at capitalising on the government's aviation policy and expanding into the international market. He indicated that Australian was keen to begin services to New Zealand. Mr Schaap had warned that Australia's airlines may not be able to afford to expand quickly into the international sector. However, Qantas could provide an opportunity for Australian to enter the Pacific market. British Airways and Air New Zealand are believed to be interested in acquiring stakes in Australian Airlines. Singapore Airlines is thought to be interested in taking a stake in Qantas. Northwest Airlines, the US international carrier, said it had formally advised the Australian government it would not submit bids for Qantas or Australian Airlines. Northwest, taken private via a Dollars 3.65bn leveraged buy-out in 1989, claimed that neither carrier met its criteria as an investment opportunity. It said recent changes in Australian government policies increased the uncertainty and risk associated with buying into Qantas. However, the US airline is struggling under a huge debt burden, and some industry observers had questioned whether it could even survive in its current form.</p>

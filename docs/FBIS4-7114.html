			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by B.A. Santamaria from the "Focus" section: </F> "US Banks on Power of Bullyboy Tactics"]    [Text] With the collapse of communism as a political  ideology whose universalist aspirations were backed by the once  formidable military, political and financial power of the former  Soviet Union, the familiar parameters of the Cold War  disappeared.    In fact, if not in theory, not only in Russia -- the core of  the former union -- but in the newly independent republics into  which the union had broken up, the old Soviet apparatchiks were  still effectively in power.    The only difference was that, for the purpose of public  relations, they had conveniently transformed themselves from  communists into "nationalists". Free-market experts from the  West solemnly enjoined on them the necessity of privatising  State property.    They were preaching to the converted. The apparatchiks  "privatised" large chunks of Soviet property -- by stealing  them! They "bought" them at knock-down prices, put the ownership  into their own names, and often sold them to western interests.    Well aware of what runaway inflation at home would do to the  proceeds, they generally insisted on being paid in dollars,  which they proceeded to invest in banks that protected their  anonymity -- mainly in Switzerland and Lichtenstein. Even the  Italian Mafia was brought into the picture.    Now, however, the honeymoon is over. In order to reinforce  their personal positions the new leaders -- still, in general,  old-time communists -- are playing the nationalist card even  more strongly attempting to steal the political clothes of  Vladimir Zhirinovsky by reassembling the former Soviet States  into a new Russian dominated federation. States like Belarus,  Azerbaijan, Armenia, Georgia, Moldavia, and the three Central  Asian republics are already "in the bag", with the future of  Ukraine still to be determined. Even Poland and Lithuania,  while clearly outside the bag, have re-elected old-time  communists to office.    It is no longer the ghosts of Lenin and Stalin that hover  uneasily on the political horizon. It is the more traditional  Russian figures of Ivan the Terrible and Peter the Great.    To believe that the United States -- the only remaining  genuine superpower -- is on top of the problems which, with the  effluxion of time, will inevitably result from these  developments, would be an illusion. President Clinton himself  clearly has little time to devote to anything other than his own  -- and his wife's -- personal problems, as his Republican  opponents gradually tighten the noose, seek to revenge  themselves for Nixon and Watergate, and to lay the foundations  for a future Republican victory.    In appointing Strobe Talbott as Assistant Secretary of State  (for Russian affairs) Clinton has handed the control of the US's  Russian policy to one who believes that the US's exertions in  the Cold War were profoundly mistaken, and that the Soviet Union  was more sinned against than sinning.    The military power of the US -- which, whether or not it is  guided by any consistent political vision, is overwhelming -- is  concentrated on three regions: northeastern Asia; Latin  America; and the Middle East.    In relation to Latin America, the US has successfully  reasserted the Monroe Doctrine. In relation to north-eastern  Asia, the developing conflict between North and South Korea is  finally directed to the safety of Japan. In the Middle East,  the issue is American control of Saudi Arabia's oil supplies.  The purpose of the Gulf War was to provide a formula to enable  the US to base its military forces and equipment in Saudi Arabia.    What other objectives remain within the framework of US  foreign policy today? One is tempted to say "not many". There  is, however, more to it than that.    The US will have won few friends with what is little short  of  outright bullying in the cases of China and Japan. These  ancient societies do not respond to public humiliation.    In relation to China, the pretence that the US is seriously  concerned about the "human rights" of Chinese citizens deceives  no one. China has had at least 500,000 political prisoners for  decades. There are reportedly about 20 million ordinary  prisoners in labour camps, whose unpaid slave labour supplies  one of the main foundations of China's allegedly booming  economy. The US has observed these permanent factors of Chinese  society with equanimity for many years. Why the sudden outbreak  of moral concern?    With the Japanese, it is the familiar indignation with  Japan's "inaccessible" markets, dimmed only temporarily by the  deal with Motorola and with the foreign rice-growers.    Despite Japanese trade barriers, Germany has succeeded in  exporting more cars to Japan than Japan exports to Germany.  Japanese trade barriers cannot be as tight as all that. Why  then the constant beating of the nationalist drum against Japan?    Last Wednesday [30 March] week, the US Treasury Secretary,  Lloyd Bentsen, delivered an under-reported address in New York.  He stated that the key objective of US policy over the next two  years would be to enforce full access by American banks and  other financial institutions into all leading countries. The US  would be prepared, he said, to retaliate against countries which  refused full access to its financial institutions. The presence  of American banks, he said, was necessary to allow the US to  share in the prosperity of Asia's markets.    Bentsen visited Beijing at the end of January. A joint  statement was signed by him and China's finance minister Liu  Zhongli which announced that this year US banks would be  permitted to establish themselves in China's main cities to  trade in Chinese currency. The South China Morning Post  reported in January this was "only on a limited experimental  basis". Is the hypothetical agitation about "human rights"  anything more than a cover for the real issue, the accelerated  entry of American banks to the Chinese mainland? The links  between the Clinton Democratic administration and the  controlling groups of the US investment banks are extremely  close. As chairman of the National Economic Council, Clinton  chose Robert E. Rubin, who is also co-chairman of Goldman Sachs  Ltd, one of the most powerful of them all, and not noted for  representing any interest other than those of its investors. If  there is more to the foreign policy of the Clinton  administration than the exclusively financial interest, it  remains to be explained.</p>

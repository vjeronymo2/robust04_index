			<p><P> March 1, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> PEGGY BUCKEY'S 1ST DAY AT SCHOOL STIRS UP PROTESTERS  </P> <P> Former McMartin Pre-School defendant Peggy Ann Buckey was greeted by protesters  today as she arrived at her new job at the Anaheim Union High School District's  Trident Center, where she is to teach two students.  </P> <P> About a dozen protesters from an Orange County coalition of victims' rights and  child advocacy groups waved placards reading "Crime Victims Say No to Buckey"  and other slogans as teachers and students arrived at the alternative school in  Anaheim. Buckey slipped into her new classroom before 7:30 a.m. and avoided a  confrontation.  </P> <P> "We're not saying she's guilty. We're not saying she's innocent. We're saying  she's suspect," said Howard Garber, director of the Citizens Anti-Crime Task  Force.  </P> <P> He was joined by representatives of the Orange County Citizens Against Child  Abuse, Young Citizens for Law and Order, National Exchange Club for the  Prevention of Child Abuse, Fullerton Citizens for Decency and National  Coalition Against Pornography.  </P> <P> Buckey, 32, who successfully fought to regain her teaching credentials after  all molestation and conspiracy charges against her were dropped in 1986, will  teach a small class of high school students with learning and communication  disorders.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Belgrade, February 17 (TANJUG) -- Representatives of  the parliment of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (F.R.Y.)  "most warmly" on Thursday thanked the Russian colleagues for a  statement of Duma, the lower house of the Russian parliament,  which stated concern over the discussions at NATO about the  possibility of air strikes on the targets on the territory of  the former Yugoslavia.    A telegram expressing thanks was, on behalf of the  parliament, sent by speakers of the parliament chambers Radoman  Bozovic and Milos Radulovic to their Russian counter-parts,  Vladimir Shumeyko and Ivan Ribkin.    The U.N. Security Council in late May 1992 imposed  comprehensive and binding sanctions against the F.R.Y. over its  alleged involvement in the war of local Serbs, Croats and  Moslems in the neighboring, former Yugoslav republic of  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    NATO threatened on February 9 to carry out air strikes on  positions of the Bosnian Serbs and Moslems, who clashed around  Sarajevo unless by Sunday midnight (GMT) heavy weapons were not  withdrawn to a distance of 20 kilometers from the center of the  city or placed under U.N. control.    We are convinced that the appeal of your esteemed parliament  for a peaceful settlement of the crisis, lifting of the unjust  and inhuman sanctions and reintegration of the F.R.Y. into the  world community would be inspiring for friendly Russia to  persevere in such initiatives at the U.N. Security Council and  that this would mobilize all the justice-loving countries to  implement this idea, the telegram said.    The solidarity of Duma with the Serbian people "at  exceptionally difficult circumstance" was assessed in the  telegram as "more than mere encouragement", that is, "as a  confirmation of the fact that the Serbian people, in its just  resistance to outside pressures, has in the Russian people a  true friend and full understanding and support."</p>

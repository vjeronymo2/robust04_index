Construction of the project will start in January and  trial operation is scheduled in August next year. By that time,  the province will have an additional 33,000 inter-and  intra-provincial communication lines.    It has been reported that the project will run through three  major regions--eastern, central south, and southwest China--and  is an important component of the key fiber optic cable network  to be built by the state during the Eighth Five-Year Plan  period. The project starts from Hangzhou and Fuzhou in the  east, passes through Jinhua, Quzhou, Shangrao, and Yingtan to  reach Nanchang, and through Nanping and Fuzhou to reach  Nanchang. The two lines merge into one in Nanchang and proceed  to the destination of Chengdu via Changsha, Guiyang, and  Chongqing. The overall length of the communication system is  4,354 km with a total of 107 stations set up along the lines.  The length within the boundary of Zhejiang Province will be 433  km, and 10 stations will be set up in Hangzhou, Fuyang, Tonglu,  Gantan, Jiande, Lanxi, Jinhua, Longyou, Quzhou, and Jiangshan.</p>

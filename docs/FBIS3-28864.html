			<p>Language: <F P=105>Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [NODONG SINMUN 12 February commentary: "The United States </F> Must Act With Discretion"]    [Text] The United States, which has built a grave obstacle  to peacefully resolving the nuclear issue on the Korean  peninsula even after overturning its agreement with us, is now  behaving more recklessly. Completely contrary to the agreement,  U.S. hard-line conservatives urge us to accept a full-scope  inspection [chonmyon sachal] and are openly maneuvering to bring  our nuclear issue to the UN Security Council. They are also  urging France, Britain, Russia, and other countries to join in  sanctions [chejae] on us. This is a maneuver to bring the  situation to a catastrophe [paguk] to the end.    As clearly manifested in the agreement reached at the  DPRK-U.S. contact held toward the end of last year, the  inspection which we agreed to receive is an inspection for  purely ensuring the continuity of safeguards [sunsu tamboui  yonsoksong pojangul wihan sacharida]. This inspection is  starkly different [omyonhui kubyoltoenda] from regular and  irregular inspections [chonggi mit pijonggi sachal] legally  required by the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT].    Inspection for ensuring the continuity of safeguards has  stemmed from our special position [tuksuhan chiwi] that we  temporarily suspended the effectuation of our withdrawal from  the NPT.    The United States must not have forgotten the agreement  reached at the DPRK-U.S. contact which was held toward the end  of last year, not several years ago, or failed to differentiate  an inspection for purely ensuring the continuity of safeguards  from a full-scope inspection [chonmyon sachal], which is  tantamount to a return to the treaty.    In view of our special position and the promise between us  and the United States, demanding a full-scope inspection can in  no way be justifiable. Nevertheless, U.S. hardline  conservatives ask us to accept a full-scope inspection and are  openly maneuvering to have sanctions [chejae chochi] imposed on  us in case we do not accept this request. This cannot be  construed otherwise than an act for blocking the peaceful  resolution of the nuclear issue and deliberately bringing the  situation to a catastrophe.    This kind of act by the United States in fact shows that it  has from the beginning no will to resolve the issue peacefully  through talks, but that it is only pursuing the goal of trying  to provide a moral obligation to crush [apsal] us in whatever  way.    Viewing from its cause and characteristics, the nuclear  issue  on the Korean peninsula is an issue which must be resolved  between us and the United States. It is very clear that the  nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula is not an issue to be  discussed at the UN Security Council. The hardline  conservatives of the United States are trying to drag our  nuclear issue to the United Nations. This is because it is a  reemergence of its habitual maneuver to use the United Nations  as its tool of tyranny.    France is actively following such maneuvers of the United  States. France is a nuclear power and has committed innumerable  nuclear tests, thus seriously polluting man's ecological  environment. Therefore, it is a country that is receiving  resolute protest and denunciation from the broad peace-loving  people of the world. France's act of scheming with the United  States by shamelessly interfering in the nuclear issue on the  Korean peninsula, is indeed inviting the people's hatred.    As the whole world knows, we have already clearly announced  that any kind of sanctions will be regarded as a proclamation of  war against us. It is a well known fact that we by no means  make empty talk. The hard-line conservatives of the United  States and their followers who are scheming to unreasonably drag  our nuclear issue to the UN Security Council to take sanctions,  must contemplate on what dangerous consequences their moves can  bring about.    Pressure and threat do not by any means work for us. The  United States must correctly know who it is dealing with and act  with discretion.</p>

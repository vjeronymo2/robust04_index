			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / Craxi leaves party but music had already stopped IN AN ironic turn of the wheel of fortune Mr Bettino Craxi last night agreed to step down from the leadership of the Socialist party at a hotel within 500m of where in 1976 he was first elected to the post. He took over a divided party and cleverly exploited its pivotal position in Italian politics as an ally of the Christian Democrats throughout the 1980s. But he now leaves a party rudderless, despised by the electorate and internally demoralised by the cumulative blows of the year-old Milan corruption scandal. Mr Craxi himself has become the chief political victim of this scandal. He has now received six warrants from magistrates warning him he is under investigation for close to 50 instances of corruption and illicit party funding from contract kick-backs. He was first urged to resign from the party and make way for new blood after the Socialists' poor showing in the April 4 general elections last year. Fellow political veterans like Mr Giulio Andreotti, the Christian Democrat and six times prime minister, and Mr Arnaldo Forlani, the Christian Democrat party secretary, saw the writing on the wall and stepped aside. However, Mr Craxi obstinately clung to power and as the corruption scandal broke, he saw this as a deliberate attempt to undermine him and his family. His brother-in-law, Mr Paolo Pillitieri, a former Milan mayor, was one of those charged with corruption early on in the investigation. By refusing to resign, he increasingly split the party and identified it in public eyes as the political grouping least capable of renewal. Thus in hanging on so long, refusing to resign when receiving in December his first warrant of investigation, he has merely brought increased discredit on the party. His protests of innocence have gone unheard. This behaviour and abrupt decline in his reputation has obscured his earlier achievements. When he took over the party he saw the need to move to the centre ground, distancing the party from the Marxist side of socialism. He changed the party's symbol to a red carnation from the hammer and sickle. He realised he could use the party's 12 per cent vote as a key to helping the Christian Democrats stay in power. With his strong personality (he was often accused of being a bully), he managed to convince the Christian Democrats to allow him to become prime minister in 1983. He was the first Socialist prime minister and the first from Milan. He presided over a stable government lasting 1,058 days, the longest in post-war history and a considerable achievement compared to the average that lasted a fifth of this time. His other main achievement will be regarded as initiating a process to cut indexed wages - the scala mobile. But Mr Craxi will also be remembered for consolidating and expanding the control of the ruling parties over the state apparatus. He permitted and encouraged a systematic division of the spoils of office, placing his men in key positions throughout the state apparatus. This meant that the benefits of the economic boom of the 1980s were squandered, public spending was allowed to grow unchecked and corruption thrived. It was precisely this system, which began under his premiership and which continued until the end of the last Andreotti government in April 1992, that lies behind his downfall.</p>

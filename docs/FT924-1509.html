			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Late program trading sharply weakens Dow Wall Street US SHARE prices fell sharply yesterday afternoon as program trading combined with a second day of strong selling of IBM stock, and also the erosion of Goodyear's share price, to drive the market lower, writes Karen Zagor in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average blue chip indicator dropped 29.18 to 3,255.18 after spending most of the day only modestly lower. New York SE volume was heavy with 244m shares changing hands. Falls outscored rises by 1,041 to 726. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500, however, eased only 1.05 to 431.52 and the Nasdaq composite dipped 1.12 to 649.63. There was little reaction to the day's economic news, that housing starts were 1.5 per cent higher in November. Although the gain was stronger than expected it was consistent with a picture of a gradually improving US economy. The October report was revised to show a gain of 0.2 per cent from a previously reported decline of 1.1 per cent. IBM continued its downward spiral, tumbling Dollars 4 1/4 to Dollars 51 7/8 after dropping Dollars 6 3/4 a day earlier. Investors started to flee from IBM, one of the market's biggest stocks, after the company said on Tuesday that it was cutting 25,000 jobs and taking a Dollars 6bn restructuring charge. In the technology sector, Compaq improved Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 43, regaining its previous day's loss. Motorola added Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 101 1/2 , but Digital Equipment shed Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 32 1/2 . Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber fell Dollars 3 1/4 to Dollars 66 1/2 after the stock was downgraded by Merrill Lynch, reflecting concern that European and Latin American currency fluctuations would hurt the company's fourth-quarter earnings. American Cyanamid lost Dollars 2 to Dollars 56 on news that it had agreed to buy a 53.5 per cent stake in Immunex by contributing Dollars 350m towards the creation of a new biopharmaceutical company. Immunex put on Dollars 1 at Dollars 46 1/4 on the Nasdaq. Safety-Kleen, a hazardous waste recycler, plunged Dollars 6 1/4 to Dollars 24 3/4 in heavy trading on disappointing fourth-quarter earnings projections. The company said that it expects to post profits of Dollars 12.5m in the quarter after a charge of Dollars 1.3m. In the 1991 fourth quarter Safety-Kleen earned Dollars 13.9m. In contrast, Intel soared Dollars 6 1/8 to Dollars 83 1/2 , above its previous 52-week high of Dollars 80 1/2 , on strong fourth-quarter earnings predictions. The integrated-circuit maker expects the quarter's earnings to be well above analysts' expectations, thanks to high demand for its Intel 486 microprocessors. Canada THE Toronto market ended sharply firmer after a round of prime lending rate cuts of a quarter-point, a rise in bullion prices and a positive report by the OECD fuelled a rally, which came in spite of the setback on Wall Street. The TSE 300 Index advanced 31.5 to 3,296.1 and rises led declines by 360 to 310. Volume was again heavy, totalling 43.5m shares, after Tuesday's 52.7m. The gold and silver index climbed 146.3 to 5,293.4, led by American Barrick, CDollars  7/8 higher at CDollars 38 5/8 . Comex gold futures ended USDollars 3.40 up at USDollars 338.70. South Africa was closed for a public holiday.</p>

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on Colombian economic developments monitored through 8  February.    Corabastos (expansion unknown; involves supplies) reports  that in January the price of 30 basic staples increased by  between 0.5 and 204 percent. On 1 February, the DANE (National  Administrative Department of Statistics) released a report on  the cost of living for January showing a considerable increase  in food prices, which could raise the cost of living index by as  much as 3.5 percent. Meanwhile, Cesar de Hart Vengoechea,  president of the Association of Colombian Farmers, said the  consumer index was low because of the sacrifices of the farming  sector and low profits. He said the opposite would be true with  increased prices and farmers would be able to make a little  profit. (Santa Fe de Bogota EL NUEVO SIGLO in Spanish 1 Feb 94 p  2B)    During January, food and transportation prices increased the  most and the consumer index increased 3.15 percent. This  increase was .09 percent lower than the same period in 1993 when  a 3.24 increase was recorded, which raises the government's  hopes of meeting its goal of 19 percent inflation in 1994. DANE  Director Rodolfo Uribe says the index was affected primarily  because the price of vehicles, gasoline, parking lots fees,  tires, etc. increased 9.23 percent. Prices in the health sector  increased the most in areas like consultation, hospitalization,  lab tests, and dental services. (Santa Fe de Bogota EL NUEVO  SIGLO in Spanish 2 Feb 94 p 1, 1B)</p>

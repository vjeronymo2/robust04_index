			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: Italy Investors are warming to the view that recent political developments in Italy mark a turning point for Europe's third biggest economy which should stimulate development of more attractive capital markets. The likely confirmation of a non-political central banker, such as Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, as prime minister is bound to win applause from investors. This week's appointment of the no-nonsense Antonio Fazio as governor of the Bank of Italy also reinforces Italy's new-found commitment to economic reform, control of inflation, privatisation, and a reduced budget deficit. The Milan stock market has certainly responded enthusiastically. Its 21 per cent rise this year has far outpaced UK, French and German markets. The surge partly reflects relief that nightmare scenarios suggesting economic melt-down as a result of Italy's colossal budget deficit and political turmoil have proved unfounded. Perhaps it also hints at the beginnings of a virtuous circle whereby growing confidence leads to a firmer lira, falling interest rates, a reduced budget deficit and blossoming equity and bond markets. But the Milan market already attaches a high rating to forward earnings while the underlying economy is precariously poised. A forward multiple of around 25 as calculated by Goldman Sachs leaves little to chance as many industrial companies experience tough trading with Italy's largest trading partner, Germany, slipping deeper into recession. There are bound to be more twists in Italy's political saga which will influence the market. Investors must hope that favourable sentiment concerning Italy's political evolution prevails over the lingering economic worries.</p>

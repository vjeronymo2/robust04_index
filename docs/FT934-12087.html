			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Technical fixes don't make good policy Sir, In his article of October 26 ('Time to retune for Emu harmony'), Sir Leon Brittan claims that everything can be on course for Emu if inflation rate co-ordination is substituted for over-rigid interest rate and exchange rate co-ordination. So much for a past in which, for many European governments, maintaining the exchange rate within a narrow band was taken to be the vehicle of inflation rate convergence. The realities of the European situation are not so simple that Sir Leon's new formula will work any better than the old. Even if inflation convergence could be achieved by monetary targeting, that could leave individual countries with widely divergent unemployment rates. Then exchange rates would be correct only in a transitory and insecure sense. To lock them at that point with an Emu key, as Sir Leon would wish, would be to throw all subsequent burdens of adjustment on to national flexibility and migration. The problem at its root is that EC Europe is not an optimal currency area and cannot easily become one. To slide around that obstacle with fine words, new targets, and technical fixes, will neither establish good economic policy, nor will it work as politics. Germany, in particular, is unlikely to settle for an insubstantial convergence defined by formulae convenient at the time.

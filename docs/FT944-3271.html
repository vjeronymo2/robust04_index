			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: BAA charges not excessive Sir, Rupert Darwell's article about BAA (Personal View, December 12) is based on a totally false premise. He complains that landing charges to our airline customers are excessive . . . 'generally higher in the UK than in the US'. This is completely untrue. As an independently-published review of the 40 leading international airports reveals, BAA's landing charges are lower than those of nearly every leading US airport. Charges at New York's JFK are double those of London's Heathrow. BAA's main European rivals  - Frankfurt, Paris and Amsterdam  - also charge significantly more. (Incidentally, BAA's charge of Pounds 4 a passenger for all its facilities and security checks is less than half the chancellor's recently introduced passenger tax.) These charges, lower than those made by so-called non-profit-making airports, are, of course, only possible because of our retail success and the extra efficiency and productivity that privatisation has encouraged. Yet, despite the lower charges, BAA's airports are judged by passengers to offer superior facilities and services. Our own monitoring of the opinions of half a million passengers a year demonstrates steadily growing customer approval since privatisation. And in a recent survey of customer opinions of 18 leading European airport terminals, BAA's south-east airport terminals took four of the top six places. Finally, in addition to a satisfactory return to shareholders, highly competitive landing charges, and much-appreciated customer service, the company, by spending Pounds 1m every day, is providing Britain with an essential part of its infrastructure  - high quality, international airports  - at no cost to the taxpayer. We are in no doubt that, come the next review, the regulator will recognise that. But then, unlike Mr Darwell, the regulator will have his facts straight.

The basis for the Order to Show Cause was that Dr. Jack's continued registration would be inconsistent with the public interest, and that he had been excluded from participation in a program pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 1320a&hyph;7(a). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Order to Show Cause was sent by registered mail and delivered to Dr. Jack on September 12, 1994, at his registered location in Tampa, Florida. No response was received from Dr. Jack or anyone purporting to represent him. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to 21 CFR 1301.54(d), the Deputy Administrator finds that Dr. Jack was waived his opportunity for a hearing. The Deputy Administrator has carefully considered the investigative file in this matter, and enters his final order under the provisions of 21 CFR 1301.57. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Deputy Administrator finds that Dr. Jack was convicted, on December 16, 1991, in the Circuit Court of Hillsborough County, Florida upon his plea of nolo contendere, of seven misdemeanor counts of petit theft related to the provision of Medicaid services. He was sentenced to three years probation and ordered to pay restitution. On July 14, 1992, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) mandatorily excluded Dr. Jack from the Medicare program for a period of five years and directed that he be excluded from state programs pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 1320a&hyph;7(a) by virtue of his conviction of criminal offenses defined in 42 U.S.C. 1128(a), and 1128(b)(1&hyph;3). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Deputy Administrator further finds that on January 4, 1994, Dr. Jack was convicted of the felony of retaliation against a witness in the above noted state case and sentenced to four years probation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Deputy Administrator may revoke or suspend a DEA Certificate of Registration under 21 U.S.C. 824(a), upon a finding that the registrant: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Has materially falsified any application filed pursuant to or required by this subchapter or subchapter II of this chapter; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Has been convicted of a felony under this subchapter or subchapter II of this chapter or any other law of the United States, or of any state relating to any substance defined in this subchapter as a controlled substance; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Has had his state license or registration suspended, revoked, or denied by competent state authority and is no longer authorized by state law to engage in the manufacturing, distribution, or dispensing of controlled substances or has had the suspension, revocation, or denial of registration recommended by competent state authority; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Has committed such acts as would render his registration under section 823 of this title inconsistent with the public interest as determined under such section; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Has been excluded (or directed to be excluded) from participation in a program pursuant to Section 1320a&hyph;7(a) of Title 42. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 823(f), ``[i]n determining the public interest, the following factors will be considered: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The recommendation of the appropriate State licensing board or professional disciplinary authority. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The applicant's experience in dispensing, or conducting research with respect to controlled substances. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The applicant's conviction record under Federal or State laws relating to the manufacture, distribution, or dispensing of controlled substances. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Compliance with applicable State, Federal, or local was relating to controlled substances. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Such other conduct which may threaten the public health or safety.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is well established that these factors are to be considered in the disjunctive, i.e., the Deputy Administrator may properly rely on any one or a combination of factors, and give each factor the weight he deems appropriate.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Henry J. Schwarz, Jr., M.D.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Docket No. 88&hyph;42, 54 FR 16422 (1989). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Deputy Administrator finds that Dr. Jack's conduct underlying his state convictions threatens the public health and safety. Thus, his continued registration is inconsistent with the public interest. The Deputy Administrator further finds that Dr. Jack has been excluded from participation in a program pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 1320a&hyph;7(a). Based on the foregoing, the Deputy Administrator concludes that Dr. Jack's registration must be revoked. 21 U.S.C. 824(a)(4) &amp; (5). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, the Deputy Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, pursuant to the authority vested in him by 21 U.S.C. 823 and 824 and 28 CFR 0.100(b) and 0.104 (59 FR 23637), hereby orders that DEA Certificate of Registration, BJ0575603, previously issued to Neville Jack, M.D., be, and it hereby is, revoked, and that any pending applications for registration, be, and they hereby are, denied. This order is effective December 30, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: November 23, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Stephen H.

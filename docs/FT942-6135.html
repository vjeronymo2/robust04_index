			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Conditions must be right for China to be in Gatt Sir, Your leader, 'Bringing China into the Gatt' (May 30), stresses the need to deal with some difficult issues before finalising China's accession to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade or to its suc-cessor, the World Trade Organisation. You are right to include in the list of such issues the state-owned enterprises and the export of prison-produced goods. What is equally important, however, is to obtain the removal of non-tariff barriers inhibiting exports to China, together with a substantial reduction and binding of Chinese tariffs. Such a step - if properly implemented by China and policed by Gatt and WTO - would at once cut the ground from under backward looking policies of central control and self-sufficiency; it would also, importantly, make it much more difficult for Chinese enterprises to disrupt world markets by dumping practices. It is vital for the world trading system to get these conditions for Chinese accession right. The Gatt should not be pressured into agreeing unsatisfactory compromises for the sake of speed. C M Purvis, director general, International Rayon and Synthetic Fibres Committee, Avenue E van Nieuwenhuyse, 4, B-1160 Brussels, Belgium</p>

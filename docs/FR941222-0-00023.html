			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Before using the Standardized NUHOMS, the general  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> licensee must evaluate them to ensure the site is encompassed by the design  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bases of the approved cask. The events listed in the comment are among the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> site-specific considerations that must be evaluated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The site evaluation for a nuclear plant considers the effects of nearby  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transportation and military activities. It is incumbent upon the user of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cask to determine if the SER for the facility encompasses the design basis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analysis performed for the Standardized NUHOMS or any certified cask. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> great majority of the aircraft are single-engine propeller airplanes which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> typically weigh on the order of 1,500 to 2,000 pounds. The cask's inherent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> design will withstand tornado missiles and other design loads and also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provides protection from the collision forces imposed by these light general  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aviation aircraft without adverse consequences. NUREG&hyph;800, Section 3.5.1.6  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Standard Review Plan for Light Water Reactors,'' contains methods and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> acceptance criteria for determining if the probability of an accident  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> involving larger aircraft (both Military and civilian) exceeds the acceptable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> criterion. It is incumbent upon the licensee to determine whether or not the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reactor site parameters are enveloped by the cask design basis as required by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10 CFR 72.212(b)(3). These would include an evaluation demonstrating that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements of 10 CFR 72.106 have been met.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Turbine missile analyses typically show a very low probability of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> turbine missile breaking the turbine casing. The site's turbine missile  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analyses must be considered as part of the facility's analysis of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suitability of the storage location. External fires are handled by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> established fire control programs. Explosions are prevented by control of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> combustibles under the licensee's fire protection program. Sabotage is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considered under the criteria for security programs that each licensee must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implement. (See also response to comment N.1).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> F.7.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commenters raised issues about the pad and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> foundation for the Standardized NUHOMS. One commenter referred to a previous  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rulemaking that stated that the NUHOMS casks required site-specific approvals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because they are constructed in place. Other commenters, concerned with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> seismic events at the Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station and soil stability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issues similar to cask use at the Palisades Plant, asserted that there was a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary relationship of the Standardized NUHOMS cask or module to the pad at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a specific site and that evaluation of it could not be based on the reactor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> site seismic analysis. Each site required singular seismic and soil analysis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for dynamic loads and not just static loads.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NUHOMS design referred to in the July 18, 1990,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 55 FR 29181, rulemaking includes the site-specific pad as an integral part of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the concrete HSM and therefore it is important to safety. The Standardized  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NUHOMS considered in this rulemaking have the HSMs as free-standing units;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that is, they have no structural connections to the pad. The Standardized  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NUHOMS does not rely on the pad to perform a safety function to protect public  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> health and safety. The vendor analyzed the HSM containing the DSC for peak  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ground accelerations of 0.25g caused by earthquakes and found that it would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> neither slide nor overturn. NRC evaluated the Standardized NUHOMS under a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wide range of site conditions that could diminish cask safety. Further, under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the NRC general license, before using the Standardized NUHOMS a licensee must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> verify that reactor site parameters are within the envelope of conditions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reviewed by NRC for the cask approval. If potential conditions exist at the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reactor site (including potential erosion, soil instability, or earthquakes)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that could unacceptably diminish cask safety by any credible means, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> licensee's analysis must include an evaluation of the potential conditions to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> verify that impairment of cask safety is highly unlikely.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NRC's regulations do not explicitly require a licensee using a cask  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under a general license to evaluate the cask storage pad and foundation under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such site conditions for erosion or earthquakes. If conditions at the reactor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> site could unacceptably diminish cask safety by affecting the stability of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supporting foundation so as to put the cask in an unsafe condition, the cask  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may not be used unless the foundation is appropriately modified or a suitable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> location at the reactor site is found. Implicitly, therefore, the pad and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> underlying foundation materials must be analyzed under site conditions that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> include erosion, soil instability, and earthquakes, even though the pad has no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> direct safety function and the cask is designed to retain its integrity even  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assuming the occurrence of a range of site conditions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The licensee has the responsibility under the general license to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaluate the match between reactor site parameters and the range of site  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conditions (i.e., the envelope) reviewed by NRC for an approved cask.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Typically, the licensee will have a substantial amount of information already  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assembled in the Final Safety Analysis Report (FSAR) for the nuclear reactor.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, the envelope for the approved cask is identified in the NRC SER  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and Certificate of Compliance and in the cask vendor's SAR for the cask. Of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> course, the licensee should consider whether the envelope evaluated by NRC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adequately encompasses the actual location of the cask at the reactor site.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The licensee should also consider whether there are any site conditions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> associated with the actual cask location that could affect cask design and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that were not evaluated in the NRC safety evaluation for the cask.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

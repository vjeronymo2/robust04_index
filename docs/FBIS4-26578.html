			<p>BFN     [Text] Chairman Hsiao Wan-chang of the Council for  Economic Planning and Development yesterday briefed Premier Lien  Chan on the progress of carrying out a plan for invigorating the  economy. According to Hsiao Wan-chang, the plan has achieved  success in promoting investment by the private sector. He said  that economic growth is expected to increase to 6.3 percent in  the second half of 1994.    The data presented by Hsiao Wan-chang yesterday show that  the  plan has played its role in bringing the economic growth rate  within the target area. The achievements include:    1. Major investment plans have increased by a large margin.  During the period between July 1991 and April 1994, 54 major  investment plans have been filed with the Ministry of Economic  Affairs, with each plan involving more than NT$ [New Taiwan  dollars] 200 million. The total investment amount in this  period is estimated at NT$254.9 billion. There will be 93 major  investment plans in 1994, with a total investment amount of  NT$146.9 billion, an increase of 54 percent over 1993. These  figures demonstrate that the economic plan has achieved success  in promoting investment by the private sector.    2. The rate of investment by the private sector has returned  to the target area. In the second half of 1993, investment by  the private sector increased by 9.2 percent. Invigorated by the  plan, the private sector increase its investments by 18.7  percent in the first quarter of this year. It is estimated that  the investment growth rate will reach 14.5 percent in the second  quarter of this year, thus achieving the goal of the plan, which  calls for a 10-15 percent increase in investment by the private  sectors in three years.    3. The economic situation will take a turn for the better in  the second half of 1994. The economic growth rates for the  second half of 1993 and the first half of 1994 are 5.5 percent  and (an estimated) 5.6 percent respectively, slightly less than  the targeted growth rate of 6-7 percent. Lackluster exports  could be attributed to the failure to reach this goal. But it  is expected that the economic growth rate will improve to 6.3  percent in the second half of 1994.    4. The trend toward industrial upgrading continues. In the  manufacturing sector, the capital- and technology-intensive  heavy industries have continuously increased production. In the  first quarter of this year, the output value of heavy industry  represents 62.3 percent of the entire manufacturing sector, up  from 60.8 percent in the same period last year. In the  January-May period of this year, petrochemical industry exports  accounts for 53.6 percent of total industrial exports, up from  51.2 percent in same period last year. The plan has achieved  its strategic goal of upgrading industry.    5. Productivity has increased. In line with the plan for  effectively increasing productivity, labor productivity in the  first quarter of this year increased by 4.2 percent over the  same period last year.    Since the introduction of the plan in July last year, the  domestic economy has experienced a slow recovery. On top of  that, enterprises have had a hard time acquiring land for their  plants. As a result, the plan has met with frequent criticism.  Li Kao-chao, director of the Economic Research Department of  the Council for Economic Planning and Development, said: Such a  plan does not aim to stimulate an economic recovery but rather  to serve as a medium- and long-term plan for improving the  domestic investment environment. It takes a longer period of  time to judge the effectiveness of the plan. It is not fair to  criticize the plan based only on the figures for the first and  second quarters.</p>

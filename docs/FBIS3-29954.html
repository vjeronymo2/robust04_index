The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il formalized the great  leader's revolutionary ideology and promulgated the task of  modeling the entire society after the chuche idea as the supreme  program of our party in his historic work published 20 years  ago. With the publication of the work, our party has come to  have a mighty ideological and theoretical weapon which makes it  possible to push ahead with the forward movement toward  socialism, communism with certainty, and this is a historic  event which opened a new, epochal turning point for the  development of our party and the revolution.    The modern history of the Korean revolution which has been  advancing under the banner of modeling the entire society after  the chuche idea and today's realities clearly prove the  greatness of the work and its invincible vitality.    Today we recall with dignity the course of our glorious  struggle for the work of modeling the entire society after the  chuche idea on which we have been victoriously advancing along  the party's leadership, upholding the great leader [widaehan  yongdoja] at the head of the party and the revolution.    Comrades: The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il's work is an  immortal classical document which is of historic significance in  the building of our party and in the development of our  revolution. As historic experiences show, the party of the  working class can victoriously develop revolution and  construction and outstandingly perform its mission only when it  has the right guiding ideology and revolutionary theory and the  right struggle program, strategies and tactics.    Because it takes the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song's  revolutionary ideology, that is, the chuche idea, as its guiding  principle, the Korean revolution has been able not only to  victoriously open the road ahead of its struggle with the  chuche-oriented line, strategies, and tactics, but also to  consistently advance along the track of chuche without the  slightest degree of deviation and derailment in defiance of all  sorts of trials in history.    Indeed, the entire course of the Korean revolution is not  only a proud course of victory on which the great leader's  [suryong] revolutionary ideology, that is, the chuche idea, has  been brilliantly embodied and turned into a reality, but is also  a historic course on which its truthfulness and vitality have  been fully proven in all sectors of society.    The glorious course of the Korean revolution and the great  epochal changes achieved in our country have clearly shown that  the only guiding ideology which leads to victory the  revolutionary struggle and socialist and communist construction  of our era, that is, the era of independence--which is  fundamentaly different from the previous eras of history--is  precisely the revolutionary ideology of the respected and  beloved leader [suryong], that is, the chuche idea.    Taking the great leader's [suryong] revolutionary ideology  as  a guiding ideology and making efforts for socialist, communist  construction under its banner was not only a strong aspiration  of the times, but was also a unanimous desire of hundreds of  millions of people in the world.    With his deep insight into the aspiration of the times and  the demands of our developing revolution, the dear leader  Comrade Kim Chong-il published his historic work on 19 February  1974 and, thus, gave perfect answers to the problems that the  times and the revolution presented as urgent tasks. The dear  leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has profoundly elucidated the  historic position and characteristics of the great leader  Comrade Kim Il-song's revolutionary ideology, that is, the  chuche idea, which is the only guiding ideology of the  revolution and construction of our times; presented not only the  program of modeling the entire society after the chuche idea,  but also the basic mission of the party's ideological work and  the immediate tasks for the realization of the program; and  systematized them in a monolithic manner. Thus, the dear leader  Comrade Kim Chong-il has provided an invincible, mighty  ideological and theoretical weapon which can firmly guarantee  the victory of the working class' revolutionary cause, the  socialist and communist cause. This is precisely the dear  comrade leader's immortal achievements for the times and the  revolution.    The dear comrade leader's historic work is a library of the  great leader's revolutionary ideas which have made it possible  to bring about momentous changes in developing the communist  revolutionary theories, building a working-class revolutionary  party, waging revolutionary struggles, and carrying out  construction projects. It is also a militant banner that leads  our people and the revolutionary people in the world to victory.    The work has brought about a new change in the development  of  the guiding ideas of the revolution by strongly defending the  great chuche idea and further enriching it.    The dear comrade leader has developed the great leader's  revolutionary ideas into an integrated system of chuche-oriented  ideas, theories, and methods and made them completed communist  revolutionary theories on realizing the popular masses'  independence.    The dear comrade leader has formulated the great leader's  revolutionary ideas into an integrated system of the immortal  chuche idea and revolutionary theories and leadership methods  which the chuche idea has elucidated and, thus, clearly stated  that the great leader's revolutionary ideas have different  characteristics from the working class' previous revolutionary  theories. In this way, the perfect definition of the great  leader's revolutionary ideas has been given at last, and the  question concerning the guiding ideas of the revolution in our  era has been resolved brilliantly.    Since the question concerning the guiding ideas of the  revolution has been resolved completely, the working class and  the popular masses of our era, equipped with the most correct  guiding principles and strategies and tactics, have been able to  successfully build socialism and communism.    In his work, the dear comrade leader presented an idea and  theory on imbuing the entire society with the chuche idea and  stated that a communist society is a society that is based on  the chuche idea and where the chuche idea has been implemented  completely. In this way, he has provided our party with a  fundamental guideline for its activities.    The dear comrade leader early on elucidated the leader's  [suryong] status and role in the development of history and the  implementation of the popular masses' cause of independence, and  declared for the first time in history that imbuing the entire  society with the chuche idea is the foremost program of our  party. In this way, he firmly transformed the course of  socialist, communist construction into a course of implementing  the leader's [suryong] revolutionary cause.    The program to imbue the entire society with the chuche idea  is a great communism building program to reform man, society,  and nature as required by the chuche idea, successfully conquer  all the ideological and political fortresses and materialistic  fortresses of communism, and completely realize the popular  masses' independence. Because the program to imbue the entire  society with the chuche idea has been presented, our party has  been able to successfully carry out the chuche revolutionary  cause -- which the great leader cultivated -- along the most  straight road and more vigorously accelerated the historic march  toward socialism and communism. Truly, the program to imbue the  entire society with the chuche idea is an immortal milestone  that has opened a road toward historic changes in implementing  the popular masses' cause of independence, the socialist,  communist cause.    The work has elucidated the most correct road for the  ultimate victory of the socialist, communist cause in our  country and, thus, become a firm guarantee that enables our  party to fulfill its historic mission. Our party's historic  mission is to realize the popular masses' cause of independence,  the socialist, communist cause, and completely realize the  independence of all members of the society.    Thanks to the program to imbue the entire society with the  chuche idea, our party has been able to effect social changes in  building socialism and communism in compliance with the ideal of  realizing the popular masses' independence, and, as a result, a  new history has unfolded in which man's independence has been  fully realized in all fields of his social life.    The dear comrade leader has presented a general direction to  complete the chuche revolutionary cause in our country and  elucidated detailed ways to implement the cause. In this way,  he has provided a guiding principle that we must firmly adhere  to in strengthening and developing our party into an honorable  chuche-oriented party forever and endlessly enhancing the  party's leadership role and militant function as required by the  demand for imbuing the entire society with the chuche idea.    Persistently keeping up and thoroughly embodying the  revolutionary policies for socialist and communist construction  put forth in the work, our party has been able to successfully  carry out the three major makeover projects, namely, remaking  nature, society, and people, as demanded by the chuche idea, and  to splendidly build the popular mass-centered socialism of our  style.    Truly, the historic work of the dear comrade leader is a  monumental work that has summarized the great leader's  revolutionary idea and further developed and enriched the theory  on building communism and the theory on revolutionary party  building. It is our lasting assets that firmly ensure the  ultimate victory of socialist-communist construction. Because  of this immortal classic work, our party has been able to make  clear its revolutionary nature and mission as a chuche party  both in name and reality, and to steadfastly accelerate its  historic march for the completion of the chuche revolution.    Comrades: Because of the greatness of the work, the historic  work of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has boundlessly  stirred our people and the world's progressive people and  thoroughly demonstrated its indestructible vitality in our  practice of the revolution. For the past 20 years since the  publication of the work, the struggle to remake nature, society,  and people as demanded by the chuche idea has been waged  vigorously in our country under the wise leadership of the  party. Through this process, a momentous advance has been made  in occupying the ideological, political, and material fortresses  of socialism and communism, and the chronicle of our revolution  has been more splendidly embroidered with epochal changes and  heroic events.    The dear comrade leader organized and mobilized the entire  party membership and all the people to the struggle to realize  the tasks set forth in his historic work, making it possible for  the vitality of the program for modeling the entire society on  the chuche idea to be highly displayed in all fields of party  and state building and social life.    The struggle of our party and people to model the entire  society on the chuche idea has been an arduous and difficult  struggle in which we had to pioneer the untrodden road of  socialist construction in the fierce struggle against all sorts  of opportunism and class enemies within and without society.  Our party, based on its deep insight into the prevailing  situation and the reality of the international communist  movement, vigorously pushed ahead with the revolution and  construction, placing itself firmly in an independent position,  and has firmly built political, ideological, and material bases  for the ultimate victory of modeling the entire society on the  chuche idea.    We are proud to recall the past 20 years, because, through  the struggle to realize the modeling of the entire society on  the chuche idea, our party's authority has been extraordinarily  enhanced, its might further strengthened, and the main force of  our revolution solidified as an invincible one.    The dear comrade leader, who made it a theme of key  importance to strengthen the party and enhance the party's  leadership role in leading the revolution and construction, put  forth the party building policy, above all, on modeling the  entire party membership on the chuche idea. By implementing  this policy, he has strengthened and developed our party to be  invincible ranks which are firmly united based on the great  leader's revolutionary idea, and to be a militant and refined  leading political organization.    The dear comrade leader put forth a precise course and  slogan  of struggle at every point in the development of the revolution.  He published numerous historic works, such as "on destroying  the old frame and effecting a new upturn in the party work,"  "the historical lesson in socialist construction and our party's  general line," and "the fundamental problem of the revolutionary  party building," and led the party work along the road of great  upturn, thus providing a firm guarantee for vigorously pushing  ahead with the modeling of the entire society on the chuche idea.    The dear comrade leader's wise leadership made it possible  to make a fundamental turning point in the party work, and it  enabled our party to greatly demonstrate its majestic appearance  as the vigorous and seasoned party, which is excellently  fulfilling its functions and role as a militant political  organization winning the people's absolute confidence, with its  roots deep in the masses, and as the General Staff office of the  Korean revolution.    The dear comrade leader has renewed the party's appearance  under the slogan for modeling the entire society after the  chuche idea and strengthened the party to be prosperous,  ever-victorious, militant ranks. This is indeed the most  brilliant achievement that the dear comrade leader has made for  the party building cause.    The revolution's chuche might is its political and  ideological might guaranteed by human remolding and ideological  remolding. Considering the establishment of the party's unitary  control system in the entire party and society to be the first  task of the human remolding work, our party has constantly  intensified and developed the party's ideological work in  accordance with the developing revolution.    While keeping up with the ideological revolution as a key  problem, our party has intensified the indoctrination of the  party members and working people on principles of the chuche  idea, faithfulness, party policies, and the revolutionary  tradition, so that it has armed them with our party's  revolutionary ideology and the chuche idea and has vigorously  pushed ahead with the ideological transformation of the entire  society.    As a result of the party's vigorous ideological work of  modeling the entire society after the chuche idea, party  members' and working people's loyalty to the great leader and  the dear comrade leader has increased more than ever. At the  same time, the single-hearted unity of the leader, the party,  and the masses has been consolidated as firm as a rock; the  socialist chuche has been further strengthened; and its role has  been enhanced greatly.    This is a great victory achieved in the communist-style  human  remodeling work under the banner of remodeling the entire  society after the chuche idea, and this is where the source of  the invincible might lies, which enables our revolution to be  ever-victorious under any stormy circumstances.    The entire society has formed into a large revolutionary  family with the great leader and dear comrade leader as the  parents, according to the communist principle, "One for the  whole and the whole for one." All party members and working  people help one another and share joys and sorrows for the sake  of the fatherland, the people, the society, and groups, and they  are continuously innovating and advancing, filled with optimism  and faith in victory of the revolution. This is the real look  of our society, where the chuche idea has been embodied.    The reinforcement and development of our party and the  fundamental changes in our people's political, ideological,  spiritual, and moral aspects clearly show that the dear comrade  leader's historic works serve as powerful weapons for building  the party and strengthening the main forces of the revolution.    It is a brilliant result of his works that through the  struggle for modeling the entire society after the chuche idea,  economic and cultural areas and all other domains of our social  life are being reformed in accordance with the demand of the  chuche idea.    The dear comrade leader originally elucidated principled  problems in reforming the society in accordance with the demand  of the chuche idea in all domains of our social life, including  economic and cultural areas, and has wisely led the struggle to  solve the problems.    Thanks to the dear comrade leader's wise leadership, the  line  for chucheizing, modernizing, and scientizing the people's  economy could completely be implemented; our economic  independence has been strengthened; the farming  industrialization and modernization has been accelerated  according to the rural theses; and a lot of problems in freeing  the working people from hard and difficult labors have been  solved.    Thanks to the party's tested leadership we have been able  to make great advance in the fulfillment of the Third Seven-Year  Plan in defiance of the international events of the collapse of  socialist countries and under the situation in which the  imperialists' maneuvers against socialism and our Republic are  viciously perpetrated. We have also been able to build in  succession monumental edifices for the ages which amaze the  people of the world, thereby changing the appearance of our  fatherland in conformity with the demands of the chuche idea.  This extensively shows the vitality of the program of modeling  the entire society after the chuche idea and the might of our  country's self-reliant national economy and clearly symbolizes  the heroic mettle of socialist Korea which is victoriously  advancing without being influenced by the worldwide upheaval.    The dear comrade leader has taken it as an important  principle to establish chuche in all sectors of cultural  construction, to embody the party spirit, the working class  spirit, and people-mindedness, and to correctly combine  socialist content with national form, and wisely led their  thorough implementation.    With the implementation of the socialist education thesis  the  growing new generations have been prepared to become chuche-type  communist human beings, a large unit of 1,730,000 intellectuals  has been established, a grand flower garden of chuche-oriented  literature and arts has been unfolded, and all of the people  have become the creators and enjoyers of culture. This is the  immoral achievement of our party in its struggle for reforming  culture in conformity with the demands of the chuche idea.    Through the course of struggle for modeling the entire  society after the chuche idea a brilliant victory has been  achieved in the implementation of the cause for Army building,  too. As a result of the implementation of the party's  self-defending military line our People's Army has been further  strengthened politically, ideologically, militarily, and  technologically and has grown up to be an ever-victorious  revolutionary armed forces capable of repelling any invasion by  the enemies at one blow. As a result of the firm establishment  of an all-people defending system we have come to have a firm  military guarantee for the victory of the chuche revolutionary  cause.    The epochal changes and rapid development achieved in our  country's socialist construction and national defense  construction are mighty proof to the vitality of the dear  comrade leader's historic work. Through the embodiment of the  program of modeling the entire society after the chuche idea the  popular mass-centered socialism of our own style has been  further strengthened and developed, its invincible might is  being demonstrated, the generation of our revolution has firmly  continued, and its prospect is endlessly bright.    Indeed, the period of the past 20 years during which we have  accelerated the work of modeling the entire society after the  chuche idea along the road designated by the dear comrade leader  is not only a period of 20 years of great change, but is also a  period of the 20 years of creation and change which has brought  a great golden age to chuche Korea by molding nature, society,  and human beings. The period is also a period of the 20 years of  victory during which we have sternly smashed all sorts of  challenges by the imperialists and reactionaries and the  counterrevolutionary maneuvers by the opportunists and, thus,  resolutely safeguarded and defended and infinitely glorified the  socialism of our own style.    All victories and successes achieved in the course of  struggle for modeling the entire society after the chuche idea  are a noble result of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il's  excellent and tested leadership.    By elucidating the path for modeling the entire society  after  the chuche idea and by wisely leading the party and the popular  masses into its realization the dear comrade leader has  completely improved party work, that is, the party's ideological  work, and effected a new revolutionary turn in all sectors of  social life, including the economy and culture.    Thanks to the farsighted wisdom and excellent leadership of  the dear comrade leader, a great change has been effected in all  sectors of politics, the economy, culture, and military, let  alone party work. Thus, our revolution has been able to meet a  period of new upsurge, and our party and people have been able  to vigorously continue their advance along the path of modeling  the entire society after the chuche idea even amid the  formidable trials in history, full of faith in certain victory  and without the slightest trepidation.    Truly, the dear comrade leader's leadership is a source for  the victory of our revolution and a firm guarantee for boundless  prosperity and development in our fatherland.    On this meaningful occasion today, with a sense of loyalty  of  all party and people in the entire country, I extend the highest  honor and warmest thanks to the dear leader of our party and  people Comrade Kim Chong-il, who, by carrying out outstanding  ideological and theoretical activities and exercising energetic  leadership, is endlessly developing and enriching the great  chuche idea, the guiding idea of our era's revolution;  victoriously leading the cause of imbuing the entire society  with the chuche idea; and, thus, highly displaying our party's  authority and the might of chuche Korea.    Comrades: Our party and workers has advanced far while  carrying out the cause of imbuing the entire society with the  chuche idea. Still, the road toward completing the cause is  arduous and turbulent, and we have many things to do.    The imperialists and reactionaries are more viciously  maneuvering to isolate and stifle [korip chilsik] our Republic  and crush [apsal] our socialist cause, and the situation in our  country is growing very tense. In compliance with today's  situation in which we are building socialism amid tense  confrontation with the enemy and in compliance with the demand  of our revolution's development, we must thoroughly implement  the revolutionary lines of self- dependence, self-support, and  self-reliant defense and more vigorously carry out the three  revolutions--ideological, technological, and culural. By so  doing, we must resolutely defend and maintain popular  masses-centered socialism of our own style and develop it  endlessly, and realize the cause of the fatherland's  reunification, the nation's earnest desire, at the earliest  possible date.    If we are to maintain socialism of our country and  brilliantly realize the cause of imbuing the entire society with  the chuche idea, we must cherish single-hearted loyalty deeper  in our hearts and be boundlessly loyal to the leadership of the  dear comrade leader.    The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has taught: The entire  party and all people must dutifully follow [chalbadduro nagaya]  Comrade Kim Chong-il's leadership if they are to maintain  popular masses-centered socialism of our country and brilliantly  complete the chuche revolutionary cause.    The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il is our fatherland's  destiny and our revolution's banner of invincibility, and  loyally following the dear comrade leader's leadership is a  decisive guarantee for completing the cause of imbuing the  entire society with the chuche idea.    All party members and workers must have the unchanging, firm  belief that our revolution will win victory without fail as long  as there is the dear comrade leader's leadership and must be  loyal to the party's leadership single-heartedly.    Important in possessing single-hearted loyalty with which we  absolutely worship [sungbae] and follow the dear comrade leader  is cherishing the greatness of the dear comrade leader deep in  our hearts.    We must walk along the single revolutionary road, cherishing  deep in our hearts how great is the dear leader Comrade Kim  Chong-il, the people's great leader [inminui widaehan yongdoja],  an outstanding ideologist and theoretician and politician, and a  distinguished [pibomhan] military strategist who has literary  and military accomplishments and loyalty and devotion.    Strongly arming ourselves with our party's ideas and  thoroughly implementing those ideas is a prerequisite for  loyally upholding the party's leadership and completing the  chuche revolutionary cause. We must strongly arm ourselves with  our party's revolutionary idea, the chuche idea, thoroughly  implement the idea in all fields of revolution and construction,  and wage an uncompromising struggle against toadyism  [sadaejuui], doctrinism, revisionism, and all other antiparty,  antirevolutionary ideological trends that run counter to our  party's ideas. In this way, we must firmly defend the purity  [sungyolsong] of the chuche idea.    All party members and workers must make loyalty to the party  as their faith, conscience, morality, and daily life and make it  their absolute rule to think and move only in compliance with  the party's ideas and intentions anytime, anywhere.    If we, in hearty response to our party's leadership, are to  successfully carry out the cause of imbuing the entire society  with the chuche idea, we must more thoroughly establish the  party's unified leadership system.    All the party members and working people should accept the  party's lines and policies as the most just ones and as the  demand of life, and by unconditionally implementing them under  any difficult conditions and environment, they should fulfill  their fidelity and duty as revolutionary fighters sharing fate  with the party.    We should establish a firm revolutionary discipline in which  the entire party membership, all the people, and the entire army  move as one under the party's leadership, and should never  tolerate any disciplineless and nonsocialist elements. In so  doing, we should make sure to firmly establish the ethos that  within our revolutionary rank, everyone breathes with the party,  speaks in the voice of the party, and walks in step with the  party.    To victoriously advance and complete the cause of modeling  the entire society on the chuche idea, we should continuously  strengthen the unity and cohesion of the party and the  revolutionary ranks. The wholehearted unity of the leader, the  party, and the masses is the everlasting vitality of our-style  socialism, and the backbone of our revolution. Our revolution  has victoriously advanced overcoming extraordinarily arduous  trials, and we are turning adversity into a smooth condition,  adhering to and adding luster to socialism, in a grave  environment where the imperialists' antisocialist offensive is  intensified in an unprecedented manner. All this is  attributable to the fact that our revolutionary ranks have  formed a strong main force of the revolution wholeheartedly  united around the leader. revolutionary ranks around the leader.    We should taintlessly inherit the tradition of unity and  cohesion created in the pioneering period of the Korean  revolution, solidify the wholehearted unity of the party and the  revolutionary ranks as firm as a rock, crush all sorts of  challenge of the imperialists and reactionaries with the might  of the wholehearted unity, and effect continuous upsurge in the  revolution and construction.    To successfully carry out the cause of modeling the entire  society on the chuche idea, we should accelerate the socialist  economic and cultural construction continuously and vigorously.  As a present task, we should concentrate all our efforts for  the struggle to implement the party's revolutionary economic  strategy. The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song put forth the  revolutionary economic strategy in the 21st plenary meeting of  the Sixth party Central Committee and in his New Year's address  this year setting aside three years as an adjusting period in  which to carry out the agriculture-first policy, light  industry-first policy, and trade-first policy.    Dwelling in the party's revolutionary economic strategy is  our party's firm resolve and will to momentously improve the  people's living standard within a few years and to develop the  country's economy into a chuche-oriented economy which does not  shake under any economic blockade by the imperialists. We  should thoroughly implement the party's revolutionary economic  strategy in order to further strengthen the might of our-style  socialism and highly display its superiority.    To thoroughly implement the party's revolutionary economic  strategy, we should highly display the revolutionary spirit of  self-reliance and fortitude. Under the present condition where  the imperialists are further intensifying the maneuvers for  economic blockade [kyongje pongsoe] to stifle [chilsik] our  country's socialism, the way to vigorously accelerate socialist  economic construction is to exert the revolutionary spirit of  self-reliance and fortitude. Under the party's militant slogan  "Let us vigorously accelerate the socialist all-out march with  the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and fortitude," all  the party members and working people should dash forward  vigorously with the spirit of the chollima plus the speed of the  nineties and effect great upsurge in all sectors of the people's  economy.    We should actively struggle to achieve a new development in  all areas of the socialist cultural construction -- including  science, education, literature, art, and public health --  upholding the party policy on cultural revolution.    We should constantly concentrate great efforts on increasing  the national defense strength to cope with [taecho hayo] today's  acute situation, in which the enemies are ceaselessly conducting  war provocation maneuvers.    We should completely implement the party's military line and  make every preparation so as to actively cope with any emergency  situation [ku otton puruiui chonghwangedo chudongjoguro matsolsu  ittorok]. We should also thoroughly establish the ethos of  army-people unity in the entire society so as for the people to  value the military and for the army and the people to share  their fates.    The fatherland's reunification is the supreme national task  [minjok chisangui kwaop] for our people that cannot be delayed  any further.    We will make every effort to achieve the unity of the whole  nation and to reunify the country in a way of confederal system  based on the three principles of independence, the peaceful  reunification, and the great national unity, upholding the  10-Point Program of the Great Unity of the Whole Nation for the  Reunification of the Fatherland presented by the great leader.    Although imperialists are indulging in bravado and bluster  on  the international stage, talking about an end of socialism, no  one can reverse the historical trend of the worldwide people's  advance for independence.    The struggle of our party and people to implement the cause  of modeling the entire society after the chuche idea is a  honorable and sacred struggle for our fatherland's endless  growth and prosperity and for mankind's bright future, and it  will vigorously encourage the progressive people of the world  who are struggling to protect their independence.    We should actively contribute to implementing the global  cause of independence and fulfill our international duties  [uriege matkyojin kukchejuuijok uimu] by vigorously pushing  ahead with the struggle for modeling the entire society after  the chuche idea.    Our people's struggle for modeling the entire society after  the chuche idea is arduous, but our cause will achieve the  victory without fail.    There is no force in the world that can block the sublime  march of our people, who are fighting for the just cause under  the leadership of the great leader and the great party.    Let us all firmly unite ourselves around the party Central  Committee headed by the respected and beloved Comrade Kim  Il-song, and vigorously fight for the ultimate consummation of  the chuche revolutionary cause, with faith in certain victory  and revolutionary optimism, under the banner of modeling the  entire society after the chuche idea.    Long live Comrade Kim Il-song, the great leader of our party  and people!    Long live Comrade Kim Chong-il, the dear leader of our  party and people!</p>

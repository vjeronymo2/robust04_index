			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, 11 May (TANJUG) -- On the basis of the  decision by Sadako Ogata, UN high commissioner for refugees  [UNHCR], employees of this organization will not be returning to  the Srpska republic [RS], Koning Abuzaid, head of the UNHCR  mission for former Bosnia-Herzegovina, said after today's visit  to Brcko, the SRNA agency reports.    During a meeting today with Nikola Koljevic, RS vice  president, and RS Health Minister Dragan Kalinic, Mrs. Abuzaid  said this move was made because of a security threat to UNHCR  personnel following the UN decision that Serb targets can be  bombed without previous announcement. Humanitarian aid to the  people in the Srpska republic will from now on be delivered via  Belgrade, which is seen as technically more complicated.</p>

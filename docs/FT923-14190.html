			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Newman Tonks falls 9% as recession continues NEWMAN TONKS, Europe's biggest supplier of door, window and electrical fittings to the building industry, reported a 9 per cent fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 7.31m to Pounds 6.62m for the half year to April 30. Mr Geoff Gahan, chief executive, said the fall occurred against a background of the worst UK building recession in history. He predicted the downturn would continue for the rest of the year. Sales were static at Pounds 109m. About half of the group's sales are based overseas. Without this geographical spread Mr Gahan said the results would have been 'significantly worse'. The UK workforce was reduced by a further 5 per cent leading to the loss of 250 jobs. US companies, particularly NT Falcon, the California-based lock manufacturer, increased sales and profits. The group has had to pay an additional Pounds 273,000 for recently acquired NT Shapland, the largest commercial timber door manufacturer, because its pre-tax profits for the year to end-March exceeded expectations. It made Pounds 1.7m against a forecast of Pounds 1.55m. Mr Gahan said he was 'delighted' to have paid the extra money for Shapland because of its profit growth. Another recent acquisition, Moller &amp; Auster, the lock distributor and security systems group, has been integrated into the group's distribution business in Norway to form NT Moller Undall. Mr Gahan said the group would continue to review acquisition opportunities. 'Over the last six months we have had more offers than at any time over the last few years.' A reduced interest charge of Pounds 467,000 (Pounds 570,000) was due to the fall in borrowings from Pounds 20m to Pounds 14m, representing gearing of 16 per cent. The interim dividend is maintained at 3.8p, uncovered by earnings of 3.5p (4.55p).</p>

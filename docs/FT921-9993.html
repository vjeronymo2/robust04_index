			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; the Family: Options in a busted market - What happens to share incentives when a company collapses THE PLIGHT of pensioners in insolvent companies has been in the news. The other big employee benefit - share incentives - is even less likely to have any value if a company collapses. But though the shares will be worthless, the ways in which the main employee share schemes are structured will mitigate employee losses. Far and away the most popular incentive plan is the executive share option scheme. Selected executives are given the right to buy their employer's shares in the future at a fixed price - usually the market value when the right is created. If all goes well and the share price hardens optionholders will be able to pick up stock at low cost. But if the company becomes insolvent - or, for that matter, suffers a less dramatic decline - the optionholders can let their options lapse and will lose no more than the initial option fee, usually a nominal Pounds 1. This assumes that corporate disaster strikes before the executive has decided whether to exercise his option. Optionholders who take up the shares to which they are entitled will suffer in common with all other shareholders if their company subsequently falls from grace. While executive options tend to be restricted to actual and potential directors, savings-related options must be offered to all full-time staff who have completed up to five years' service. Again, the option structure eliminates the downside risk until the shares are actually purchased at the end of a five- or seven-year term. The additional factor is that these company-wide rights must be linked to an Save As You Earn contract with a bank or building society. The key point of reassurance for employees is that these savings contracts will be unaffected by the insolvency of the scheme company. Nevertheless, since the rationale of this savings plan is to fund the purchase of option shares, the collapse of the company may well prompt employees to cease further payments and withdraw what they have contributed. Whether this will be the best policy will depend upon the stage reached in the five-year saving period, and what rates of return can be obtained on similar 'safe' investments. The interest rate to maturity is a very competitive 8.86 per cent a year tax-free, whereas a premature withdrawal of funds will knock this down to 5 per cent. Thus, employees who can curb the inclination to wash their hands of anything connected with a bankrupt employer will often be well-advised to see the contract through to its conclusion. Profit sharing schemes are the other government-sponsored form of share incentive and have the same broad catchment area as savings-related options. The company pays a proportion of its profits to trustees, who buy shares in the company which they then allocate to employees - although the shares usually remain registered in the trustees' names for five years. Employees pay nothing for these shares and are generally not taxed on the benefit of receiving them. So if the shares subsequently become worthless, employees might be expected to adopt an 'easy come, easy go' approach. That analysis will, however, be over simplistic if scheme participants took shares as an alternative to a cash bonus, or if the scheme was 'contributory', ie receipt of free shares was conditional on paying for a matching number of bought shares. In either situation employees will regret having put extra eggs into a corporate basket-case rather than conserving their cash. The most important current development in employee incentives is more likely to damage creditors than employees, if insolvency strikes. More companies are setting up employee trusts - 'ESOPs' - which use borrowed funds to purchase shares which are then distributed via the conventional option or profit sharing schemes. Banks lending to ESOPs invariably require a guarantee from the employer company. If, after an ESOP has purchased shares, the price declines, the likelihood of the guarantee being called will increase. So the use of an ESOP by a shaky company risks giving a further twist to the spiral of decline. This scenario was played out to ultimate ruin when British &amp; Commonwealth collapsed in 1989. Its mammoth liabilities were bloated by a Pounds 40m guarantee in support of an ESOP which had accumulated a substantial stake in the company. Where the downward momentum is as strong as in B &amp; C's case, there is little danger of any of the ESOP shares ever reaching the employees. Indeed, cynics might speculate that ESOPs set up by ailing companies sometimes have motives which are far removed from the extension of employee ownership. It is true that an ESOP can use its sponsoring company's resources to prop up a crumbling share price. This is the only lawful way in which a company can support its own stock - but it will only be lawful if the prime objective is genuinely to boost corporate profitability by enhancing incentives, rather than to put a floor under the market. Finally, the answers you and the Select Committee have been waiting for. Yes, Mirror Group Newspapers does have an ESOP. No, there is as yet no evidence that it was used to rig the MGN share price.

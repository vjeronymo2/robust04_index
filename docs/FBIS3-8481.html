Prices here are high, up to 70 German marks (42 US dollars)  for one kilogram (2.2 pounds) of coffee, while in Kiseljak, a  town Moslems from Visoko besiege in Bosnia's war, the price is  eight marks. Cooking oil is 20 marks a litre in Visoko, four  marks in Kiseljak.    In one of the paradoxes of war, Croats in besieged Kiseljak  in central Bosnia are eating better and paying less than the  Moslems who surround them.    The key is a narrow front the Kiseljak pocket has with  Bosnian Serb forces, who continue to allow Croats to move  supplies through their lines despite Serb anger over  Moslem-Croat rapprochement, UN military officers and a leading  Moslem businessman said Wednesday in Visoko, eight kilometres  (five miles) northeast of Kiseljak.    The Serbs, under international sanctions for being the  aggressor in Bosnia since fighting began in April 1992, are too  needy themselves to pass up chances for food, fuel or hard  currency.    An additional irony is that most of the goods coming into  Visoko that are not UN humanitarian aid are from Kiseljak. The  Bosnian war is between neighbors and there has been a continuous  and considerable amount of trading across front lines.    Kiseljak is a sleepy, sprawling place of only a few thousand  people with two small main streets and a suburban, residential  feel surprisingly untouched by the war.    Visoko is a small city with a pre-war population of 48,000,  now swollen by refugees. Many of its Turkish-style wooden  houses with red-tile roofs, built along a curve in the Bosna  river, are damaged by shelling.    UN Canadian Lieutenant Bruno Vanasse told AFP the Croats  bring in a convoy once a week from Split, in Bosnian neighbor  Croatia on the Adriatic coast. The convoy detours through  Croat-held territory in southern Bosnia to avoid Moslem lines in  the center of the former Yugoslav republic.    It then approaches Sarajevo from Serb-held territory in the  southeast. Somewhere near Pale, 15 kilometres (nine miles)  southeast of Sarajevo, the Croats pay their "tax" to the Serbs  -- 30 percent of the goods in the convoy, Vanasse said.    The convoy enters Kiseljak through a Serb checkpoint just  southeast of Kiseljak.    Vanasse said this arrangement has not changed despite the  Croats and Moslems declaring a ceasefire in their fighting  February 28 and moving to create a political federation, which  for the moment has isolated the more powerfully armed Serbs  against a common front though diplomatic efforts are underway to  try to bring the Serbs into the process.    Asmir Hodic, a leading Moslem businessman in Visoko, told  AFP  the Serbs were furious about the Moslem-Croat alliance but were  not about to stop the convoys to Kiseljak.    The only retaliation they have made is to demand six tons of  fuel, instead of the previous three tons, as part of the price  of entry to Kiseljak.    Hodic is himself an active trader with the Croats,  exchanging  leather goods made in his family factory and coffins in his  funeral business against food. He has become one of the few  people to use a UN checkpoint set up last week to guarantee  freedom of movement on the road between Kiseljak and Visoko,  Vanasse said.    Asmir, 27, runs the city funeral parlor in Visoko. He said  he gives away most of the food he gets from Kiseljak but does  sell some of it on the black market since it is the only way to  buy the wood and parts needed for coffins as Visoko's city  administration has no money.</p>

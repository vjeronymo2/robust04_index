			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / Observer: Santa's opt-out clause Another convert to the musings of Nostradamus? Yesterday the British Chambers of Commerce set some kind of precedent by reacting to today's inflation figures 24 hours ahead of time. A fax to the FT at 11.30 am on Tuesday cited Richard Brown, the deputy director-general, as welcoming the news of 'the unchanged underlying inflation rate'. Had there been a leak? Alas, an hour later, the BCC confessed that the early fax was due to 'temporary Christmas insanity'. It seems that, in its confusion, the Chamber had thought the inflation figures would be published yesterday. On ringing the Central Statistical Office's statsline, it gleaned the news about underlying inflation, but did not realise that the CSO was referring to October rather than November. Still, if underlying inflation is unchanged when today's figures are announced, expect Brown to be headhunted by Old Moore's Almanack.</p>

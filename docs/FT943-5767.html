			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / ABB to shed 289 train plant jobs ABB Transportation's train and tram-building works in York is to shed 289 jobs, the company said yesterday. The redundancies follow a shortage of orders at the plant, which has no work beyond October next year. ABB Transportation, part of Asea Brown Boveri, said it could see a long-term future, but was facing a short-term crisis. Mr Bo Sodersten, managing director and chief executive, said it was essential that new orders were won quickly. Mr Bill Beaman, the plant's engineering and electrical union convenor, said redundancies had been expected, but not so many. Mr Frank Dobson, shadow transport secretary, said the redundancies were the result of the freeze on investment caused by rail privatisation. ABB said it was chasing orders under the government's private finance initiative. Today its Derby plant will submit a tender worth about Pounds 750m to London Underground for new Northern Line trains.</p>

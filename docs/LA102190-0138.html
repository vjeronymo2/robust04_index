			<p><P> October 21, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NHL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> FLAMES SHELL SLUMPING BRUINS  </P> <P> All the Calgary Flames needed to break out of their scoring slump was a team  with a slumping defense like the Boston Bruins.  </P> <P> The Bruins, coming off an 8-1 beating in Edmonton on Friday night, were drubbed  by the same score in Calgary on Saturday night.  </P> <P> It was a fitting ending to a nightmarish road trip for Boston. The Bruins ended  a seven-game, two-week road swing with five out of a possible 14 points  (2-4-1).  </P> <P> The Flames, lukewarm for the first seven games this season, scored five  first-period goals. Defenseman Al MacInnis had two goals and two assists.  </P> <P> Rookie Robert Reichel scored his first NHL goal for the Flames. Calgary's Mark  Hunter pleased a sellout crowd with a power-play goal and an assist.  </P> <P> Paul Ranheim and Brian MacLellan got Calgary rolling in the first period with  goals eight seconds apart, Ranheim's coming on a power play. Stephane Matteau  and MacInnis also scored in the first, ending goaltender Andy Moog's  nightmarish game. He was replaced by Rejean Lemelin.  </P> <P> The victory improved Calgary's Smythe Division record to 5-3-0 for 10 points,  three behind the first-place Kings. The Bruins are 4-4-1.  </P> <P> Quebec 5, Detroit 3 -- Joe Sakic had two goals and an assist and rookie  goaltender John Tanner beat the Red Wings at Quebec for his first NHL victory.  </P> <P> Mike Hough, Michel Petit and Lucien DeBlois also scored for the Nordiques  (3-3-3). Shawn Burr, Brent Fedyk and Dave Barr scored for the Red Wings  (4-3-2).  </P> <P> Buffalo 3, New York Islanders 1 -- Rick Vaive and Donald Audette scored  power-play goals 31 seconds apart in the second period as the Sabres beat the  Islanders at Uniondale, N.Y., for their first victory of the year.  </P> <P> Clint Malarchuk faced only 20 shots for the Sabres (1-4-3). Wayne McBean scored  the only goal for the Islanders (2-5-0) in the first period.  </P> <P> Philadelphia 5, Montreal 3 -- Scott Mellanby's goal 7:46 into the third period  broke a tie and helped the Flyers beat the Canadiens for their sixth  consecutive victory.  </P> <P> Pelle Ecklund added a goal at 13:25 to wrap up the scoring for the Flyers  (6-2-0). Tom Chorske, Stephane Richer and Russ Courtnall scored for Montreal  (4-4-1).  </P> <P> New York Rangers 4, Pittsburgh 3 -- Brian Bullen scored the game-winner with  3:17 to play in the Rangers' victory at Pittsburgh.  </P> <P> It was the sixth victory in the past seven games for the Rangers (6-3-0). The  Penguins are 3-4-1.  </P> <P> Washington 4, New Jersey 0 -- Don Beaupre stopped 27 shots and Calle Johansson  scored two goals to lead the Capitals at Landover, Md.  </P> <P> It was the first shutout for the Capitals (4-5-0) against New Jersey (5-3-1)  since February 1984.  </P> <P> Toronto 6, Chicago 2 -- Gary Leerman, a 51-goal scorer in 1989-90, scored his  first of the season as the Maple Leafs won their first game at the expense of  the Blackhawks at Toronto.  </P> <P> Scott Thornton, Rob Ramage, Wendel Clark, Kevin Maguire and Vince Damphouse  also scored for Toronto (1-6-1), who had managed only four goals in their  previous three games.  </P> <P> Greg Gilbert and Troy Murray scored for Chicago (5-4-0), which had a 41-30  advantage in shooting.  </P> <P> St. Louis 2, Minnesota 2 -- Dave Gagner's goal with 9:52 to play helped the  North Stars gain a tie with the Blues at St. Louis.  </P> <P> The Blues (4-3-1) had taken a 2-1 lead on power-play goals 31 seconds apart by  Gino Cavallini and Cliff Ronning in the second period, but could not hold off  the North Stars (1-5-2).  </P></p>

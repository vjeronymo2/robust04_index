			<p><P> April 7, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD;  </P> <P> U.S. CANAL CHIEF RESIGNS  </P> <P> The Panama Canal Commission's American chairman, William Gianelli, announced  his resignation effective May 1. Commission sources said that he was  discouraged by the continuing conflict between Washington and the regime of  Panamanian strongman Manuel A. Noriega, saying it has hurt the morale of canal  employees. Last week, Gianelli accused Panama of "interfering with the  operation" of the canal by harassing commission employees. The commission, made  up of five Americans and four Panamanians, is a U.S. agency that has operated  the canal since sovereignty over the waterway was turned over to Panama on Oct.  1, 1979, under the Panama Canal Treaties.  </P></p>

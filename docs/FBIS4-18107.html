			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Richard Savill: "Dublin Closes Terrorist </F> Extradition Loophole"]    [Text] Belfast -- The Irish Senate yesterday approved  extradition legislation designed to close loopholes that have  caused friction between London and Dublin.    The Extradition (Amendment) Bill, 1994, due to become law  within two months, extends the range of offences that cannot be  regarded as political.    Westminster MP's were furious when the Irish High Court  recently freed Joseph Magee, 27, from Armagh, who was wanted in  England in connection with the murder of Sgt Michael Newman, 34,  in Derby on April 14, 1992.    Two of the three grounds given for quashing the extradition  order were that the offence was political and that the procedure  followed when his extradition was ordered by the lower District  Court had been unfair. The legislation is designed to close  both loopholes.    The new law would mean that people committing violent crimes  involving firearms and explosives would no longer be able to  claim their offence was political.</p>

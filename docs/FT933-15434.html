			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / Estonian president seeks constitutional amendment on aliens law President Lennart Meri yesterday asked the Estonian parliament to reconsider and amend a contentious aliens law that has strained relations with Moscow and angered ethnic Russians here, write Matthew Kaminski in Tallinn and Anthony Robinson in London. The Council of Europe has criticised the proposed law as failing to give minorities the level of protection laid down in the European Convention of Human Rights. The law requires a language test for Estonian citizenship, a clause which excludes most Russians, around 40 per cent of the population. The president's move came shortly before the Estonian Defence Force headquarters claimed that Russia had begun concentrating troops across the river from Narva, the Russified eastern border city. The Russian parliament voted last week to impose economic sanctions and halt troop withdrawals from Estonia, fanning Estonian fears that Moscow wants to turn Estonia into another Transdniestr, the contested region bordering Romania. Estonians are also nervous about a decision by ethnic Russians to hold a referendum on regional autonomy on July 16 and 17 in Narva and the nearby town of Sillamae.</p>

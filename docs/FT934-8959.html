			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Acquisition costs hit Molyneux ACCELERATED interest payments resulting from an acquisition left Molyneux Estates, the USM-quoted property investor, with a pre-tax loss of Pounds 2.53m for the year to June 23, against Pounds 1.1m. As part of buying out its partner in the Overgate Centre, Dundee, the company repaid Pounds 1.47m of interest early. The accounts reflect the consolidation of Overgate, with the comparatives being restated, but not the completion of the acquisition. Turnover for the period was Pounds 3.96m (Pounds 3.6m) reflecting the continued increase in income receivable. Losses per share were 11.24p (3.07p). The company said that with the increase in the capital base following the placing and open offer to fund the acquisition combined with a fall in interest charges and increased rents receivable it saw the future with confidence. In view of the present profitability a final of 1p is recommended, the first dividend since 0.5p was paid in 1991.</p>

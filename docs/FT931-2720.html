			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / Letter: Budget whittles away at pensions and penalises with ACT changes (1) Sir, It is intriguing that Norman Lamont, the chancellor, has cancelled the statutory retail prices index increase in the amount of pensionable earnings for the next financial year. It stays at Pounds 75,000. It seems to be government policy that the relief will be whittled away by inflation over time, rather as the mortgage interest tax relief figure has been. It is all very odd; by the turn of the century not only will fewer promised pension benefits be protected by any form of funded security, but only the lower-paid will have any interest in pension funds. It reflects a conflict of policy between the Treasury (determined to abolish the perceived tax breaks of pension schemes) and the Department of Social Security which, like its colleagues throughout Europe, for demographic reasons is anxious to encourage the funded private sector to assume the burden of the provision of retirement income in order to relieve the public sector. Since a recent Institute for Fiscal Studies study indicated that the tax breaks were in reality rather modest, shouldn't the DSS try to argue its corner a little more strongly? Otherwise, maybe the Goode Inquiry into pensions law should now call a halt to its deliberations, and save some public money. Without trying to sound hyperbolic, if the policy is continued then by the end of the decade there are unlikely to be that many pension funds around to need increased protection.

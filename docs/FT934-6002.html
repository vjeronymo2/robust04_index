			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / International Company News: Further turbulence for shares in Euro Disney Euro Disney, the troubled leisure group, yesterday had another turbulent session on the stock market when its shares fell sharply by 13 per cent during the morning only to bounce back in the afternoon to close 8 per cent higher at the end of the day. The shares, which on Wednesday plunged by 18.6 per cent to a record low of FFr27.2, were suspended several times in Paris when they breached their trading barrier to fall to a new low of FFr23.7 by lunchtime. However, the shares then rebounded to FFr31 before finally closing at FFr29.4. Analysts said investors started to buy Euro Disney shares to cover their short positions on the stock. The volume of trading was even heavier than on Wednesday with 5.3m Euro Disney shares, or 3.16 per cent of its total equity, changing hands. Until the afternoon rally Euro Disney's shares had fallen fairly steadily in the fortnight since the group disclosed an unexpectedly heavy net loss of FFr5.3bn (Dollars 898m) for the year ended September. The stock market had been expecting a smaller net loss of about FFr2bn. The impact of the loss announcement has been aggravated by concern about the prospects for Euro Disney's emergency financial restructuring. Euro Disney has been forced to ask Walt Disney, the US entertainment group that owns 49 per cent of its shares, for financial support until it has completed the refinancing. The Disney camp last week opened negotiations with the 60 international banks that own Euro Disney's FFr20.3bn net debt. The recent pressure on Euro Disney's shares threatened to trap the company in a vicious cycle given that a lower share price would limit its capacity to raise capital in a rights issue.</p>

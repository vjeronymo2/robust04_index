			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / International Company News: Israel reviews bank sell-offs after Hapoalim setback Israel's government was yesterday reviewing its large bank privatisation programme after investors spurned the latest issue of 10 per cent of Bank Hapoalim, Israel's largest bank, offered on the Tel Aviv stock market. The government managed only to sell 69 per cent of its 1.2m share offer, raising Shk403m (Dollars 139m), Shk200m less than expected. A further 1 per cent of shares were sold to employees at a discounted price, raising Shk43.7m. The government's first offer of 20 per cent of Bank Hapoalim in May was oversubscribed 2.2 times and raised Shk780m. Bankers and stock market analysts yesterday blamed the government for mismanaging the share issue and warned of similar results at next week's offer of 10 per cent of Bank Leumi unless technical changes were made to the structure of the issue. They said the government had ensured the flop by abolishing the maximum share price, leaving out underwriters and refusing to attach options or warrants. The elimination of the maximum price on the issue meant there was no pre-sale to institutional investors. 'The new structure of the issue precluded investors that usually invest on the first day to make a quick killing. Basically, the concept of the market was if there is an availability of shares on the market at a known price then why go through the process of allocation without knowing what the price will be,' said one banker. 'The problem was with the technical structure of the issue not with the financial attractiveness of Bank Hapoalim,' he added. Shares in Bank Hapoalim offered by the government in May have appreciated 30 per cent in real terms in the past six months. The government said yesterday it was committed to next week's sale of 10 per cent of Bank Leumi, Israel's second largest bank, in spite of the failure of the Bank Hapoalim issue. But market experts said unless the structure of the issue was changed investors would spurn the Bank Leumi offer.</p>

			<p><P> May 15, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> PAULEY SET FOR NEWSMAGAZINE  </P> <P> Jane Pauley will take a shot at the newsmagazine format this summer, but she  said she'll have lots of help.  </P> <P> "It's not going to be 'The Jane Pauley Show,' " the former "Today Show" host  said in the May 19 issue of TV Guide.  </P> <P> "We're going to take advantage of NBC correspondents. I'm not going to be the  sole talent."  </P> <P> The unnamed show will premiere on NBC on June 27, with a summer run of five  shows. If it becomes a regular series, January, 1991, would be the earliest for  a regular time slot, she said.  </P> <P> NBC anchor Tom Brokaw won't be one of those on the show, Pauley said.  </P> <P> "Tom pointed out that his plate was pretty full," she said. "So he couldn't  make an additional commitment to our show."  </P> <P> She laughed off rumors that she would join Brokaw on "The NBC Nightly News" as  co-anchor.  </P> <P> "It doesn't look to me like 'Nightly' needs any help," she said. "As far as I'm  concerned it's moot -- as delicious as that prospect might sound."  </P></p>

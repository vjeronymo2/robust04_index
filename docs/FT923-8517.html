			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / EC ratifies dumping duties on Korean radios THE EC is making anti-dumping duties on imports of South Korean car radios permanent, it said yesterday, Reuter reports from Brussels. The Community's Official Journal said it was setting the duty at 34.4 per cent, with reduced rates for 18 companies which co-operated in its investigation into whether the radios were being sold in the EC at unfairly low prices. Under the decision, Goldstar will pay 3.9 per cent duties, Hyundai Electronic Industries 10.8 per cent duties and Samsung Electronics 20.8 per cent duties. The investigation by the European Commission, the EC executive, which imposed duties provisionally six months ago, backed up industry complaints that the radios were being sold on the EC market at significantly less than it cost to make them. With the help of the low prices, radio imports rose 180 per cent from 1985 to 1989, and EC manufacturers were forced to lower their own prices, leading to loss of profits and lower market share.</p>

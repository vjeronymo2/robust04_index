			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  editorials and articles carried by ROK vernacular newspapers on  1 June commenting on the UN Security Council presidential  statement on the North Korean nuclear issue.    Conservative CHOSON ILBO on page 3 carries a 1,000-word  editorial entitled "Though Another Presidential Statement Has  Been Released...." which starts out by saying that this  statement is a "very soft statement," then notes that "North  Korea is unlikely to comply with this statement" and that "this  may have merely added an ace card to North Korea's hand of  nuclear cards." Pointing out that "the stronger the North  Korean position, the more carrots the International Atomic  Energy Agency [IAEA], the ROK, the United States, and the United  Nations have offered," it concludes by saying: "Even if the  international community imposes sanctions on North Korea, North  Korea, which is enjoying the nuclear game, is not expected to  promptly change its attitude. Also, if the international  community tries to resolve the issue through negotiations even  while going in the direction of sanctions, North Korea will try  to take ill advantage of this, as well. Therefore, resolving  the nuclear issue requires our side's resolute will."    The moderate TONG-A ILBO carries a 1,000-word editorial on  page 3 entitled "Quickened Pace at the Security Council." The  editorial first describes the background of the UN Security  Council's adoption of the presidential statement and notes that  "if North Korea refused to accept the UN Security Council's  presidential statement, the Security Council will, unavoidably,  pursue sanctions." It then says that "we cannot accept any  negotiations in which North Korea's past nuclear activities will  be overlooked" and that "the carrots that will be available to  North Korea once the North Korean nuclear issue is resolved  diplomatically have already been made public." The editorial  finally expresses the hope that "North Korea will make a wise  choice."    The left-leaning HANGYORE SINMUN carries a 1,000-word  article  by correspondent Chong Yon-chu in Washington on page 3 entitled  "Sanctions Will Be Inevitable If North Korea Continues To  Replace Fuel Rods." The article starts out by saying that the  adopted presidential statement is likely to lead to the  resumption of negotiations between North Korea and the IAEA, and  that it is speculated that North Korea may stop short of  replacing fuel rods at the last moment. The article then notes  that if North Korea should continuee to replace fuel rods, "this  should be interpreted as North Korea's determination not to  disclose its 'nuclear past' at all costs."    Moderate CHUNGANG ILBO carries a 1,200-word article by  reporter Kang Yong-chin on page 3 entitled "Government's  Measures on the North Korean Nuclear Issue."    The articles says the ROK Government is busy mapping out  measures as the uncertainty over the North Korean nuclear issue  increases and is even examining the possibility of imposing  sanctions against North Korea by the ROK, the United States, and  Japan if North Korea refuses to resolve the nuclear issue  through dialogue and if international sanctions are not possible  because of China's veto at the UN Security Council. It also  says that even though it considers military sanctions to be  undesirable, the ROK Government is looking into possible  measures should the United Nations or the United States choose  to impose military sanctions.    The moderate HANGUK ILBO carries on page 3 a 1,000-word  article by Kim Su-chong, the correspondent at UN Headquarters.  The article points out that "China's flexible position made it  possible for the UN Security Council to adopt the presidential  statement immediately," and quotes a Chinese diplomat as saying  "China is concerned about the possible situation to be resulted  from the rupture of North Korea-U.S. talks if North Korea  continues hurried replacement of fuel rods."    The article says that "without any concrete countermeasures  against the North Korean nuclear issue, the United States seems  to expect that the presidential statement of the UN Security  Council will induce Chinese influence upon North Korea as well  as urge it to accede to dialogue."    The article concludes by noting the possibility that "North  Korea will break through the crisis caused by its fuel rods  replacement by using its unique tactic," and saying: "North  Korea has used a hide- and-seek tactic. While driving the  nuclear issue to a critical phase, North Korea has strung the  United States along by offering dialogue whenever the UN  Security Council was going to take measures against it."    The moderate KYONGHYANG SINMUN carries on page 3 a 900-word  article by New York and Washington-based correspondents Pak  Su-man and Yi Chong-yon. After explaining the background of the  adoption of the recent UN statement on North Korea, the article  reports that "the IAEA's abandonment of negotiations and the  abrupt adoption of the UN Security Council president's statement  on the North Korean nuclear issue has made the prospect of  U.S.-North Korea dialogue very cloudy."    The pro-government SEOUL SINMUN carries on page 5 a 900-word  article by Washington-based correspondent Yi Kyong-hyong. The  article stresses the following three points as being significant  in the adoption of the UN statement on North Korea: First, the  statement "supports the IAEA position on future measurement of  nuclear fuel rods;" second, the implication in the statement  that "the UN Security Council's will to take immediate follow-up  measures, such as sanctions, if North Korea rejects the future  measurement of fuel rods;" and third, the promptness shown in  adopting the statement. It stresses that this reflects the UN  Security Council's recognition that "the issue of replacing  North Korea's fuel rods is an imminent problem in need of a  speedy solution."    Regarding China's position, the article cites experts'  analysis that "in view of smoothed relations with the United  States, China will take great account of the fact that the  denuclearization of the Korean peninsula complies with its own  interests." Quoting diplomatic sources in the United Nations  and Washington, the article also reports that China will  "inactively participate" in taking possible follow-up measures  against North Korea.</p>

			<p><P> March 21, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'VOLUNTARY' WORK REWARDED BY SANDINISTAS, OTHERS REPORTED ABUSED;  </P> <P> FREED SOMOZA GUARDS DESCRIBE LIFE IN PRISON  </P> <P> During nearly 10 years in a Sandinista prison for his service in the  pre-revolutionary National Guard, Octavio Borgen had plenty of time to count.  He said his jailers beat him 27 times.  </P> <P> Thirty-five times, the former captain recalled, he was put in a dark punishment  cell with no room to lie down. Five times he was taken from his cell in Modelo  Prison to El Chipote, a notorious interrogation center. Once he endured three  days of hostile questioning without sleep.  </P> <P> Until his release last Friday in a mass pardon of 1,894 former guards, Borgen  said he was repeatedly castigated for his refusal to submit to prisoner  "re-education," a regimen of daily labor and weekly political lectures aimed at  adapting the soldiers of a defeated army to life under Sandinista rule.  </P> <P> Judging from random interviews with 20 of the freed ex-guards, who were  pardoned under a Central American peace agreement, the Sandinistas  systematically abuse prisoners who do not work and reward those who do, even  though the work program is supposedly voluntary.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Reason to Repent  </P> <P> Many of those prisoners who worked said they did so to gain more freedom inside  the jail and did not regard their decision as a sellout. All those interviewed  said they did nothing criminal as guards and had no reason to repent.  </P> <P> Former guards who refused to work spoke of imprisonment as an extreme test of  their principles.  </P> <P> "To accept re-education would have been to admit guilt and become a slave of  the system," the 45-year-old Borgen told a visitor at home on his first full  day of freedom. "But not to accept it meant to live for years in a situation of  extreme tension."  </P> <P> In an acknowledgement of its discriminatory treatment of prisoners, the  government excluded 27 non-working inmates from last week's pardon. Under the  Feb. 14 peace accord, all former guards were to be freed except those found  guilty of serious crimes during the Sandinista-led uprising against President  Anastasio Somoza in the late 1970s.  </P> <P> But in testimony before a National Assembly panel, the chief of Nicaragua's  prison system asked that 29 be kept in jail for their "hostile attitude toward  the re-education process."  </P> <P> The Sandinista-dominated assembly voted to deny pardons to 27 of those  prisoners. Twelve others were kept in jail on the basis of criminal records.  Those 39 are serving 15- and 30-year terms.  </P> <P> Most guards rejected prison labor until the mid-1980s. The holdouts eventually  dwindled to about 700, but they were joined in their refusal to work by several  hundred prisoners who are still held on charges of aiding the U.S.-backed  Contras.  </P> <P> All the non-working prisoners call themselves plantados, after the Cuban  inmates who reject re-education by Fidel Castro's Communist government.  </P> <P> As a matter of regulation, working prisoners are allowed family visits every 15  days and may receive unlimited quantities of food from them. Non-workers get to  see their families every 45 days, and food deliveries are limited to 15 pounds.  </P> <P> At the Modelo Prison in Tipitapa, home for most anti-Sandinista prisoners,  workers are kept in separate galleries with access to television and may hold  special religious services, such as baptisms, outside the jail -- privileges  denied to non-workers. Only workers are eligible for weekend furloughs.  </P> <P> Non-workers are confined to their cells except for one hour of weekly exercise,  while working prisoners leave every day to grow food, make army boots and  uniforms, repair official vehicles, make car license plates and mix concrete  for prefabricated government houses -- jobs for which they are paid a fraction  of the minimum wage.  </P> <P> Besides such formal distinctions, non-workers freed last week said they were  subjected to physical and psychological pressures aimed at forcing them to  work.  </P> <P> Those pressures ranged from beatings and confinement in punishment cells to  such harassment as dumping prisoners' food on the floor and denying them access  to visitors or to showers.  </P> <P> One non-working prisoner said that he was deliberately kept in an ill-fitting  uniform and that his sewing needle was seized when he tried to alter the fit.  Others said working prisoners were infiltrated among the plantados to report  violations of prison rules, such as reading the opposition newspaper La Prensa.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Jungle of Spies'  </P> <P> "Our gallery was a jungle of spies," said Hazel Maraz, 26, a former guardsman  freed last week.  </P> <P> Americas Watch, a U.S.-based human rights organization, has criticized the  Sandinistas for punishing prisoners for refusing to work. It objected to the  decision to exclude 27 such prisoners from the pardon.  </P> <P> "We have problems with keeping people in prison because of their behavior in  prison," said Juan Mendez, a Washington spokesman for Americas Watch. "That  behavior has nothing to do with guilt or innocence."  </P> <P> But the Sandinista prison chief, Alvaro Guzman, said the 27 were punished for  leading the resistance to re-education and threatening prisoners who worked.  "This small group represents the essence of Somocismo (Somoza philosophy)  inside the prison," Guzman said.  </P> <P> Former plantados denied they had leaders. They said some of the 27 were denied  pardons for having been high-ranking guard officers or writing letters from  prison publicizing abusive treatment.  </P> <P> "Our discipline was not that of a military hierarchy," said Borgen, the former  guard captain. "The guard was finished, but we maintained our self-respect. The  Sandinistas never understood this."  </P> <P> Clara Obando, wife of the highest-ranking plantado, former National Guard Col.  Silvio Mayorga, said her husband asked her advice on whether he should work,  pointing out that she could visit him more often if he did.  </P> <P> "I told him no," she said. "He is a trained engineer. I knew that if he worked  with a machete, it would finish him morally." Mayorga was among those denied a  pardon last week.  </P> <P> Sandinista officials insist that prisoner re-education is for the protection of  society because it teaches useful job skills to one-time enemy soldiers trained  for little else but war. They say the political lectures are largely  informative, like civics classes.  </P> <P> "The revolution was made to free man of his negative habits, his deforming  tendencies, his vices," Interior Minister Tomas Borge said in a recent speech  defending the program.  </P> <P> Some working prisoners freed last week said they viewed the program as  positive.  </P> <P> "It was quite useful, because we knew nothing, for example, about the  Sandinista constitution," said Pedro Antonio Gonzalez, 27. "We began to see  things more objectively."  </P> <P> Gonzalez, a farm youth with a sixth-grade education when he joined the National  Guard, said he decided to start prison work in 1985, after a spiritual  conversion to Christianity. Partly to see his parents more often and partly to  gain the "emotional freedom" to train himself as a pastor, he said he  volunteered to learn to maintain prison vehicles.  </P> <P> "I wasn't working for the regime but out of Christian love for my fellow man,  to rid myself of hatred and rancor," Gonzalez said.  </P> <P> The former guardsman spoke last Saturday evening after a Managua service of the  Church of God, a Pentecostal sect headed in Nicaragua by a former guard officer  pardoned in 1985. The church encouraged inmates to work and gained hundreds of  converts in Modelo Prison after authorities gave it greater access to the jail.  </P> <P> Non-working prisoners said they shunned the Church of God, calling it an arm of  Sandinista propaganda. They also told of a different reaction to political  education, saying it consisted of being insulted as unrepentant criminals.  </P> <P> The contrast between the workers and the plantados was evident during the  prisoner release ceremony last Friday. When prison officials in the grandstands  were introduced, the workers, who had been placed in the front rows on a  basketball court, applauded. The plantados, in the rear, were silent.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition, ``control'' is not limited to authority over firm or interruptible transportation. Informal actions of the management committee or the partners could provide the marketing affiliates with significant advantages, such as non-public transportation information. For example, if Ozark intends to build a new pipeline under Part 284 of the Commission's regulations, the partners could convey that information to their marketing affiliates, and the marketing affiliates would have an advantage over nonaffiliated marketers in obtaining customers. Likewise, information with respect to the addition of new receipt of delivery points could be of significant advantage to the marketing affiliates.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ozark also states that it has not discriminated in the past and that no Ozark partner has vetoed any transportation transactions. Ozark asserts that its operating structure together with its history should serve to successfully rebut a presumption of control. But the partners' ability to control the management and policies of the pipeline is not linked to whether Ozark has discriminated in the past. In Order No. 497, the Commission found sufficient anticompetitive conduct industry-wide to substantiate the need for the rule. The court upheld the rule in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Tenneco. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Commission need not produce evidence of discrimination with respect to each pipeline to justify application of the rule to any one pipeline.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, Ozark argues that it is subject to the undue discrimination provisions of section 4 of the NGA and therefore will not discriminate in favor of its affiliates. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 29 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Despite these prohibitions, the Commission found the need for additional guidelines to deter anticompetitive conduct and concluded in Order No. 497 that standards of conduct and reporting requirements were appropriate. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 30 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Ozark's argument that it should not be subject to Order No. 497 because it is subject to other regulations is inconsistent with the purposes of Order No. 497.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 29 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Section 4 of the NGA as well as 18 CFR 284.8(b) and 284.9(b) generally prohibit a pipeline from granting an undue preference to any person.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 30 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on Inquiry Into Alleged Anti-Competitive Practices Related to Marketing Affiliates of Pipelines, 52 FR 21578 (June 8, 1987), FERC Stats. &amp; Regs. &para;32,445 at 33,563&hyph;5 (1987).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D.

Request for Rehearing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Hadson asserts that the Commission's procedures for acting on &sect;&sect;161.3(j) and 284.286(e) filings are illegal. Hadson states that the Commission treats these filings as non-tariff filings which are assigned an MG docket prefix. Hadson states that according to &sect;161.3(j) the filings are made to enable shippers and the Commission to determine how the pipeline is complying with the substantive standards of conduct. Hadson submits that the filings cannot achieve this purpose, however, since they are withheld from public notice in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and in the Commission's daily orders. Hadson contends that they are effectively concealed from public view in the great majority of cases since shippers and other interested members of the public have no way of knowing when to look to find a new or revised MG filing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Hadson states that, moreover, the Commission has ruled that the MG filings are non-adversarial and that the Commission may therefore rely upon non-public and off-the-record communications in determining whether a pipeline is in compliance with the substantive standards or not. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 31 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Hadson states that the Commission has further ruled that no one may protest or intervene in the non-public proceedings. Hadson states that any attempt to assert that a compliance filing is not in compliance with the law will be redocketed in a new proceeding and treated as a complaint in which the erstwhile protestant bears the burden of conducting discovery to prove that a pipeline's compliance filing is not in compliance with the law, rather than the pipeline being responsible for showing compliance. <FOOTCITE>32</FOOTCITE>   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 31 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Citing, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  ANR Pipeline Co.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> et al., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  55 FERC &para;61,260 at 61,833, n. 6 (1991),  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> order on reh'g and clarification sub nom.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Algonquin Gas Transmission Co.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> et al., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  58 FERC &para;61,143 (1992).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 32 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Id.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Hadson argues that similar problems taint the filings under section 284.286 since Order No. 636 appears to generally incorporate the existing procedures and relies upon them to support the effective deregulation of the unbundled pipeline merchants under the Subpart J certificates. Hadson states that the basis for this conclusion is that Order No. 636 appears to maintain the dichotomy between tariff provisions (which presumably would be made in an MT or successor docket) and procedures (which filing requirement, the Commission states, would be similar to that of &sect;161.3(j)). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 33 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Hadson asserts that the primary difference between the new and the current procedures, and the only apparent reason for not incorporating &sect;161.3(j) along with the various other sections which were incorporated by reference, is that the new rules have deleted the statement that the filing will enable shippers and the Commission to determine how a pipeline is complying with the standards of conduct.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 33 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Citing, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Order No. 636, III FERC Stats. &amp; Regs. at 30,442, n. 232.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Hadson contends that the deletion of the phrase is apparently not accidental since it accurately reflects the fact that the new filing will not enable shippers or any other member of the public to (1) learn how a given pipeline defines ``operating employee'' or how it interprets the phrase ``practicable,'' (2) receive notice of any such filing, (3) have an opportunity to comment thereon, or (4) obtain a decision based upon public evidence compiled in a public record in accordance with applicable law.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Hadson states that faced with the Commission's determination to leave the definitional difficulties to be resolved in the individual restructuring dockets, it did not seek judicial review of Order No. 636 on these issues and has diligently raised these points in its comments on various pipelines' proposed Order No. 636 compliance plans.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Hadson asserts that the issue here is whether the Commission may rely upon what Hadson calls the stealth procedures of section 161.3(j) for purposes of making its decision in this docket to eliminate the publicly available monitoring requirement. For the reason set forth above, Hadson submits that the Commission cannot do so.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

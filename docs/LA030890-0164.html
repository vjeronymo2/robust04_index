			<p><P> March 8, 1990, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> BILL OFFERED TO CURB TINY MUSSEL THREATENING GREAT LAKES, RIVERS  </P> <P> Members of Congress from Great Lakes states Wednesday introduced legislation to  curb or eradicate the zebra mussel, a tiny shellfish that has infested Lake  Erie and threatens to cause damage in other lakes and rivers.  </P> <P> "The experts seem to think that this can spread very rapidly, just as it has in  Lake Erie," said Sen. John Glenn (D-Ohio), a co-sponsor of the measure, which  would authorize spending $4 million a year for five years for prevention  programs and the same amount on eradication.  </P> <P> The legislation would require freighters to dump their ballast water in the  ocean at least 200 miles from the U.S. coast.  </P> <P> The striped zebra mussel, usually no more than 1 1/2 inches long, is believed  to have arrived in North America in 1986, when a freighter from eastern Europe  flushed its ballast water into Lake St. Clair or in the St. Clair River near  Detroit. The mussels have since spread down the length of the Detroit River and  into Lake Erie, moving at about 160 miles a year.  </P> <P> Sen. Carl Levin (D-Mich.) said that the mussels forced Monroe, Mich., to ration  water for several days because they had clogged drinking water intake pipes.  </P> <P> "Over 50 other major municipal intake pipes in Michigan, not to mention  industry users, are at risk from this same type of fouling," Levin said. "They  threaten the Great Lakes' $4-billion sports fish industry by robbing the fish  and other aquatic species of essential food sources such as algae and  plankton."  </P> <P> Sen. John Heinz (R-Pa.) warned that the inedible shellfish can easily migrate  into the Mississippi, Missouri and Ohio river systems, which "could become  literally mussel-bound."  </P> <P> A female zebra mussel lays up to 40,000 microscopic eggs in a year.  </P> <P> An expert who investigated the problem for the Congressional Research Service  found evidence that diving ducks and crawfish eat zebra mussels, but he warned  that there may not be enough intact wetlands to provide habitat for more of the  natural predators.  </P></p>

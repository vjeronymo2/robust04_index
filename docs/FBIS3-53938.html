Addressing the members of the Parliamentary  Consultative Committee attached to the Defense Ministry in New  Delhi, Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao said the motivation for  diversification in defense production units does not mean any  reduction in defense production, but aims at increasing their  turnover and exposing them to commercial culture. It was  disclosed in the meeting that as part of the diversification  drive during 1993-94, 22 percent of the sales of the ordnance  factories are expected to be to nondefense customers.    The chief of the Army Staff, General B.C. Joshi, informed  the  committee of the Army's decision to induct the indigenous main  battle tank Arjun in its fold. Expressing full faith in the  capability of the tank, General Joshi said it meets all the  requirements of the Army.</p>

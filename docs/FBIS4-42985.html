			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Adrian Hamilton: "Why Union Must Take Its Lead </F> From Germany"]    [Text] Of all the mis-conceptions British politicians hold  about Europe, the most pervasive and ill-judged is the belief  that there is a plot by Germany and France to drive the  continent ever onwards towards a federal superstate, with or  without all its partners.    There is no such plot. What there is, is a community of  individual countries disillusioned by recession, unnerved by the  Maastricht debate but badly in need of some renewed momentum to  meet the challenges of enlargement and unemployment. Contrary  to the British view, enlargement of Europe has always led to  greater integration: this is no exception.    The question is: who is going to make the running? The  Franco-German axis indeed remains central, if only because  without it the European Union would fall apart. That is why  Chancellor Kohl, who will hold the presidency of Europe from  July, and President Mitterrand, who follows him in January, made  so much of their meeting in Mulhouse last week.    But the Paris-Bonn link is showing its age. France and  Germany may talk of longterm plans: in terms of practical  proposals and real weight it is through Kohl and Germany,  reunited by history but sobered by the experience, that European  impetus has to come. An enlarged Europe swings north and east.  Europe in recovery goes Germany's way.    Kohl believes he can win the October election for  Chancellor.  Mitterrand knows he is going next spring and will almost be  certainly replaced by a conservative nearer to German views.    The good news for Europhiles is that a resurgent Germany is  also a Germany anxious to keep within Europe rather than reach  out for the new opportunities in the east on its own. `Germany,'  says Dr. Hans-Friedrich von Ploetz, director-general of the  federal Foreign Office, `is in a unique situation. All her  neighbours want to work with her. There is no coalition against  Germany. We want to make this situation permanent.'    Therein lies a century of history and generations of  insecurity. Therein also lies Germany's profound commitment to  the union. Keeping Germany as part of a dynamic and expanding  European Union is the way of making security permanent. It may  be also the only way of keeping the far right under check.  Hence an obsession that Europe must create a police force and  common actions to control immigration and racism.    The good news for the British, at least for the  Conservatives, is that much of what Germany wants to do is far  from inimical to British economic thinking, even if Kohl is dead  against the idea of leaving a Europe as an `elevated free trade  area.' Nearly two years of recession and four years of  reunification have convinced German government and business that  the road to recovery is paved with flexible labour arrangements  and lower costs.    Equally, there is an almost savage mood against Brussels and  over-regulation. Reunification has reconfirmed the importance  of regional devolution. A Europe run by Germany would be a  Europe of regions, in which the powers of Brussels would be  strictly circumscribed and the functions of the Council and  Parliament clearly defined.    This owes more to German domestic pressures than  philosphical  belief. The past few years have turned the German public  inwards. Reunification has given it a greater sense of national  destiny but also a greater consciousness of cost. This has made  Germany accept that early membership by the Czech republic,  Hungary and Poland will have to be put off until their economies  are more compatible. Cost has also made Bonn reluctant to  sanction high investment in infrastructure, preferring a more  competitive environment as the means to new jobs.    That in many ways puts it on a divergent course to France,  which still believes in centralisation, federalism and  investment as the way out of recession. France, which needs  Europe to give it a central position, would prefer to push ahead  with an inner core. Germany, which likes to see allies all the  way to more distant horizons, does not.    The great question remains the single currency. The German  public doesn't want it, its independent central bank is solidly  opposed, yet Chancellor Kohl persists. The date can be put off,  he suggests, but the aim must be pursued.    It is a commitment that will not necessarily outlast Kohl  should he lose in October. On Europe, uniquely for so careful a  politician, he is way ahead of his own public opinion. But if  Kohl goes and Germany turns inward, Europe has problems.    There is no alternative to German leadership at this moment,  and not just because it has the presidency from July. France,  following it in the EU presidency, has a domestic presidential  election in the middle of its European term. Spain, Italy and  Britain are all weighed down by internal political crises.  Enlargement is far from a foregone conclusion.    The advantage of Germany's presidency is that it has at  least  had stable political leadership of its own for the past  halfcentury. It will take on structural reform of the Community  and will get decisions moving again. The disadvantage is that,  in seeking a vision of Europe after so long below the parapet,  Germany remains confined to its own experience -- regionalised,  industrialised, self-sufficient and provincial.    That leaves much for the British to play for. The whole area  of security and foreign policy is ill-defined and barely  nascent. The reformation of the Union structures has still to  be approached, let alone decided. Monetary Union is now not due  for consideration until 1997 at the earliest. But, to do this,  Britain has now to come to terms with German thinking. It's not  a case of joining them or being left out. That has always been  one of the more foolish arguments of Euro-enthusiasts. It's  simply a matter of being in there. For if the German presidency  goes sour, we are all in trouble.</p>

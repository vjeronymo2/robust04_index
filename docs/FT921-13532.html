			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / Rise in dollar halted after US-Japanese intervention SURPRISE US-Japanese action to brake the dollar's recent rise fuelled speculation yesterday that international currency movements will play a more prominent part than previously expected in Saturday's talks among Group of Seven finance ministers and central bankers in the US. However, with US government offices closed and trading in financial markets thin because of Martin Luther King Day, foreign exchange traders and analysts were unclear whether Friday night's dollar sales by the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan were intended to tackle bilateral US-Japanese problems or part of a US-inspired plan to enhance the role of the G7 in global economic management. Not in doubt was the effect of the joint intervention on the dollar's value. It halted the US currency's sharp rise that began on January 9. The dollar closed at Y123.65 in London yesterday, down Y3.8 on Friday's finish. It fell one pfennig to DM1.597, while sterling closed nearly 1 1/2 cents higher at Dollars 1.7910 compared with Dollars 1.7765 on Friday. In New York, the dollar finished a foreshortened holiday session at Y123.25 and DM1.5905. The pound closed at Dollars 1.799. Early today in Tokyo the US currency opened at Y123.55 and DM1.5863. Mr Jim O'Neill, head of capital markets research at Swiss Bank Corp in London, said the US-Japanese decision to sell dollars at Y127.15 after London trading on Friday was 'potentially more important than the occasional Friday afternoon flurry'. The US Treasury has rarely been keen on intervention in the past. Friday's move may, therefore, have been intended to show that the recent US-Japanese agreement to promote economic growth in the two countries and the world meant action as well as words. Mr O'Neill said the intervention may also have been designed to serve notice on the other G7 countries - Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada - that the US would try to breathe more life into the group as an agent for changing economic policies and priorities. One senior G7 official admitted that the other G7 countries had been surprised by the US-Japanese intervention, which was not taken in concert with other members of the group. But the official, who asked not to be identified, said both countries had reasons of their own for the intervention. If maintained, the recent sharp rise in the dollar could threaten the increased international competitiveness of US exporters and US hopes of export-led recovery. Japan, which has come under mounting criticism in the US for its growing bilateral trade surplus, would not welcome a stronger dollar because it would threaten to raise trade friction between the two countries. The interest of other G7 countries in intervention is small at present. Bundesbank officials said current exchange rates among G7 countries caused it no problems. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, believes that the G7 is a useful forum for exchanging information. But he shows no enthusiasm for the close co-ordination of G7 exchange rates and economic policies that existed in the mid-1980s. Japanese bonds slide. Page 26 Currencies, Page 29</p>

			<p><P> January 31, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> JAPANESE CAR EXPORTS MAY DECLINE  </P> <P> Japanese auto makers have projected substantial sales growth in the domestic  car market in 1989 but expect a modest rise or even a decline in their export  plans, largely because of the appreciation of the yen.  </P> <P> Domestic passenger car sales, including imported cars, hit a record 3.7 million  units in 1988, and some industry executives have predicted that the volume this  year is expected to top 5 million units.  </P> <P> Exports fell 3.2% to 6.1 million units, mainly because of sluggish sales to  North America, the Japan Automobile Manufacturers' Assn. said.  </P> <P> The United States is the largest market for Japanese auto makers, taking nearly  one third of their global sales.  </P> <P> Japan's top auto maker, Toyota Motor Corp., has projected a 2% decline in its  exports in 1989, and Mitsubishi Motors Corp. and Mazda Motor Corp. forecast  declines of 2.4% and 1.2% respectively.  </P> <P> Yutaka Kume, president of Nissan Motor Co., said, "There is concern about the  impact of the continued strong yen on exports. The situation for vehicle  exports is expected to remain severe overall."  </P></p>

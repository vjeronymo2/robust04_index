			<p><P> April 25, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATIONAL ARCHIVES  </P> <P> In the article "Pinkerton's Nuggets" (Metro, Feb. 20), staff writer Amy Pyle  incorrectly identified the National Archives as the repository of some of the  original Pinkerton National Detective Agency material. This collection,  approximately 2,000 items, is in the possession of the Library of Congress.  </P> <P> The National Archives, which is the repository of permanently valuable  documents created by the federal government, does not have any Pinkerton  material in its holdings, with the exception of the wanted poster for Butch  Cassidy and the Sundance Kid!  </P> <P> JILL D. BRETT  </P> <P> Public Affairs Officer  </P> <P> National Archives  </P> <P> Washington, D.C.  </P></p>

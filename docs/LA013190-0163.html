			<p><P> January 31, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BRETT STUNS ALL WITH SHARP DEMAND FOR MORE MONEY  </P> <P> Kansas City Royals superstar George Brett has stunned his employers, teammates  and fans with a sharply worded demand for a heftier contract.  </P> <P> Brett's remarks, which became public after an interview with the Spokane  (Wash.)  </P> <P> Spokesman-Review, included a suggestion that he should be traded if the Royals  will not renegotiate his current deal of $1.5 million a year.  </P> <P> Brett also listed six teams -- Los Angeles, Boston, St. Louis, San Diego, Texas  and the Chicago Cubs -- he would be willing to play for if the Royals want to  trade him rather than pay him.  </P> <P> Brett signed a so-called lifetime deal in 1984, an arrangement that includes a  $1.5-million salary through 1991 with options for two years beyond that.  Real-estate deals and other considerations were included that would keep Brett  on the Royals' payroll indefinitely.  </P> <P> But Brett, 36, apparently has been chafing over huge salaries being paid to  players without records approaching his own. So last Friday, on a business trip  to Spokane, Brett made his demands known to the Spokesman-Review, which ran the  story Tuesday.  </P> <P> "I understand that, yeah, I did sign a contract," Brett was quoted as saying.  "I've got to play out that contract, and I will honor that contract, but right  now I'm not looking forward to going to spring training unless my attitude  changes."  </P> <P> Brett characterized his relationship with the Royals as shaky and said the  contract problems are disturbing his off-season conditioning routine.  </P> <P> Royals General Manager John Schuerholz confirmed that he had spoken with both  Brett and his agent-brother Bobby in a frantic 24-hour period that began  Monday.  </P> <P> "I talked to George very briefly," Schuerholz said. "At the moment, that's all  I will say on the subject. I intend to talk to him again."  </P></p>

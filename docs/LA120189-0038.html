			<p><P> December 1, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES: LA CIENEGA AREA  </P> <P> The tall rectangles of solid color Roy Thurston paints are dense, crisp blanks  that unexpectedly soften with prolonged viewing. Rooted in the light and space  tradition, the artist uses commercial lacquer colors that are thick, rich and  unsettlingly difficult to pin down. From one angle a painting will appear a  dull brown geometric scab, from another, it radiates the glossy deep reddish  hue of fresh blood.  </P> <P> Incised across each painting's surface are precise, needle-sharp horizontal or  vertical lines that spread out reflected light and tenderize the hard, sanded  surface. These near invisible lines fuzz color into a softness that belies the  painting's formal geometry. On one almost black painting, Thurston filled  grooves with bright blue pigment and burnished the entire surface. It shines  like fresh asphalt trailing oily neon highlights.  </P> <P> Comfortably mining the art-as-experience field that nurtured artists like Larry  Bell and Robert Irwin, Thurston's paintings also recall the analytic painting  of Robert Ryman. Devoted strictly to color and surface, they push the  parameters of those two elements to make painting an object of formal as well  as visual contemplation.

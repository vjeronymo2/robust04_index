			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Waterglade cuts loss amid restructuring Waterglade International Holdings, the property developer, reported pre-tax losses of Pounds 11.7m for the 14 months to May 31, against Pounds 18.5m for the previous 12 months. The main factor was the lower exceptional charge of Pounds 7.06m (Pounds 13.3m) of which Pounds 4.83m (Pounds 12.8m) was a provision against the cost of development properties. During the period the company came to an agreement with its largest bank creditor, Bank of America, which took over Waterglade's largest asset in return for extinguishing all but Pounds 1.75m of the Pounds 18m debt. As an interim funding measure the company is issuing Pounds 500,000 of convertible unsecured loan stock 1994 of which Pounds 250,000 has been issued with an expected further Pounds 25,000 in the near future. It is intended to make a rights issue before the end of February next year. Waterglade has also raised a total of Pounds 1.15m through property and other sales. In addition there was a refund of corporation tax of Pounds 1.75m which helped cash flow. Of its holding in Seafield, the Dublin-based transport and property group, the company said it would be retained as a long term investment, although Seafield was selling its property interests. Waterglade tried to replace the Seafield board but it later withdrew. Turnover for the 14 months was Pounds 9.59m (Pounds 24.6m). Losses per share were 56.7p (84.5p).</p>

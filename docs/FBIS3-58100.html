He said he was opposed to making  statements on a possible next coalition "at the wrong time." He  said the FDP was seeking a double-digit result in the Bundestag  elections.    The proposals made by Federal Interior Minister Manfred  Kanther (CDU) on the issue of the "great bugging campaign" are  for Kinkel the "opening up of a secondary theater of war."  Kinkel told HANDELSBLATT in Stuttgart that Kanther's behavior  was harming the coalition because it had been agreed that the  topic should not be discussed any more in this legislative  period.    Kinkel also attacked CDU/CSU Bundestag floor leader Wolfgang  Schaeuble. The FDP rejects Schaeuble's idea of making "the  consideration of old values and virtues" a political program.    Regarding the problem of the FDP's position on the  presidential candidate, Kinkel said, addressing Hildegard  Hamm-Bruecher: "We need you, we rely on you, and you can count  on us." Mrs. Hamm-Bruecher, who was given a rapturous applause  at the Epiphany meeting, had said the day before that she would  maintain her candidacy for the office of federal president until  election day.    Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt mentioned three problems  that had to be solved economically -- the loss of the  technological top position, the "excessive growth" of production  costs, and the "over-regulation of society."    In this respect, Rexrodt presented a 10-point  plan:     -  Continuing the austerity and consolidation  course;    -  Introducing a wage freeze in the public service  sector;    -  Submitting the basic data of a tax reform;    -  Abolishing  the monopoly of the Federal Employment Office;    -  Amending the law  on working hours;    -  Further privatizing public  holdings;    -  Deregulation through the abolition of the Law  Governing Discounts and a reform of the Law Against Dishonest  Competition;    -  Consistent environmental policy based on market  economy principles;    -  Reform of subsidized housing construction  through income-oriented promotional measures;    -  Implementation of  the GATT agreement on free world trade.</p>

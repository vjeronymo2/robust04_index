			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / Eurotunnel to launch rights issue at big discount today Eurotunnel is planning to launch its Pounds 850m rights issue this morning at a price close to the minimum which would allow its vital Pounds 1.6bn refinancing to take place. The issue price is expected to be about 260p for each Eurotunnel unit. This would be 27 per cent below yesterday's 355p closing market price in London, a significant discount which reflects the uncertainties about the future revenues of the Channel tunnel operator. The expected price is only about 10p above the 250p floor that would permit Eurotunnel to raise sufficient equity finance to cover its pressing financial requirements. The company has authority to issue only 350m new shares. The rights issue will be Eurotunnel's biggest equity fund raising and one of the biggest cash calls by a UK company. Investment institutions have been reluctant to underwrite the share offer. Their concern is that all earnings from the tunnel will be swallowed by interest payments on about Pounds 8bn of debt until at least 1998 and there will be no dividend until 2003. Eurotunnel's financial advisers, SG Warburg and Banque Indosuez, were yesterday able to begin getting commitments from institutions to underwrite the shares after the company's 220 banks gave formal approval to their Pounds 700m portion of the refinancing, more than a week after the deadline. The banks are providing senior debt, or a loan which ranks ahead of all existing facilities. One fund manager said: 'Frankly, we were not keen to take the underwriting. However, Warburg can be very persuasive.' Brokers said the underwriting challenge was made more difficult by the sharp fall yesterday in the UK stock market. However, the price of Eurotunnel units, an unusual security twinning UK and French shares, fell only 5p to 355p. A significant role in supporting the share issue was played by Swiss Banking Corporation, which had agreed to provide primary underwriting for a third of the whole share offer. It tried yesterday with SG Warburg and Banque Indosuez to find sub-underwriters to reduce its exposure. Without the refinancing, Eurotunnel faced a liquidity crisis, only four years after it last came close to calling in the receivers. By next month, it will have exhausted all its cash reserves. The costs of completing the tunnel were well above original forecasts. Its problems have been compounded by the late start of freight and passenger services, which means revenues in early years of operation will be lower than it had hoped. London stocks, Page 48</p>

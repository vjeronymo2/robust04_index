			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / Arts: Sinfonietta Response Weekend - Concerts The response to the first, on Saturday, of the two concerts of the London Sinfonietta's 'Response Weekend' at the Barbican was lamentable: a trickle of regulars at the back of the hall. Conductor Elgar Howarth played without fire; the overly spacious acoustic left the more delicate, single-note moments in Conlon Nancarrow's Piece No. 2 for Chamber Orchestra (1986) sounding lost and remote, though a fair impression of its polyrhythmic complexities and plucky simulation of jazz was nonetheless conveyed. Jazz influence - the underlying theme of the weekend, whose extramural events included a concert of student jazz pieces played by Sinfonietta members in the foyer - was overt in Mark-Anthony Turnage's Kai of 1990. This is a sort of pocket requiem for solo cello (Christopher van Kampen) and an ensemble permeated by the svelte and mournful tones of muted trumpets and longing melodies for saxophone, with bass guitar and drum kit to add plenty of stomp and violence. But an early work, Etwas ruhiger im Ausdruck (1967), by Franco Donatoni, scored for the instrumental quintet of Schoenberg's Pierrot Lunaire and derived (we were told) from one bar of a Schoenberg piano piece (Op. 23, No. 2), was, though skittish, almost the opposite of jazz: studiously quiet, fragmentary, glistening phrases circling round and round; while The City of Threads (1994), for 10 players, commissioned from the Dane Anders Nordentoft was a chaste, attractive and brief display of melody. Hans-Jurgen von Bose's Scene (1991) for large ensemble and two synthesisers, on the other hand, was long and turgid. Sunday evening's concert - also under Howarth - was better attended and had a more cohesive and interesting programme, embracing a wacky piece, Marching to a Different Song (1991), by Jonathan Lloyd; the electrifying simulation of advanced jazz afforded by a more recent Donatoni work, Hot (1989), and featuring John Harle's saxophone; a rare and quaint Sinfonietta (1928) by the American experimentalist Henry Cowell; and the senior Dane Per Norgard's colourful but meandering Night Symphonies, Day Breaks of 1992. Nancarrow - a living link (born 1912) between the ragtime send-ups of Charles Ives and the metrical abstractionism of Elliott Carter - was further represented by No. 7 of his Sixty Studies for Player Piano and by its deft chamber orchestration by the late Yvar Mikhashoff. The main point of these extraordinary studies, composed directly on to punched piano rolls, is to render different speeds and rhythms at once in a way that is dazzlingly unplayable by hands on a keyboard; but an ensemble can, just, manage the music. Mikhashoff's favouring of pungent timbres such as amplified harpsichord does much to bring out the intricately interwoven strands; but it was only after hearing the original roll, as realised on the pianola by Rex Lawson, that one had to gasp 'Masterpiece]'.</p>

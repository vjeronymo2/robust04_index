			<p><P> January 19, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INTO THE NIGHT  </P> <P> The scene: GQ magazine's Tuesday night bash for January cover-boy Pat Riley at  the grand opening of the China Club, 1600 N. Argyle Ave., Hollywood. The  Lakers' coach-fashion plate-Chrysler Plymouth spokesmodel is as hotly sought a  personality as his players these days. (But are we to believe those reports  that he was up for the Kurt Russell role in "Tequila Sunrise" or is that an  over-imaginative publicist's work?)  </P> <P> The buzz: The night actually was three parties -- a GQ bash, a Riley salute and  a peek at the China Club, expected to be one of Los Angeles' hottest '89 night  spots. It's on the site of the old punk rock club Cathay de Grande, newly  refurbished with blue walls, industrial gray carpets, Pirelli-rubber staircases  and a handsome wooden bar. The place was so new it had the air of fresh paint.  </P> <P> Who was there: Riley; GQ editor-in-chief Art Cooper and publisher Michael  Clinton; Sylvester Stallone and bodyguards; actress Dyan Cannon; mogul Michael  Eisner; actor Treat Williams with Dana Delany; actress Teri Garr; actors Brian  Dennehy, Scott Baio, Peter Scolari and Dean Stockwell; broadcast personality  Wil Shriner; sportscaster Pat O'Brien; sportscaster-turned-KCBS anchorman Jim  Lampley; singer Julie Brown. No Lakers players were visible.  </P> <P> Justine Bateman watch: The party girl nonpareil was downstairs with that other  party girl, Allee Willis.  </P> <P> Dress mode: Anything went for women; natty suits for the men. A few guys had  their hair slicked back, Riley style.  </P> <P> Overheard: Mucho mano-a-mano talk, most of it unprintable. "Check out the  blonde. She wouldn't even talk to guys who make our kind of money."  </P> <P> Entertainment: Dancing to good Motown. Dancing to awful '70s hits. Watching  over-muscled bartenders do dizzying backhanded catches with the beer before  opening it and forking it over. A live band, Boys Town, went on at 10 o'clock,  but by then guests were heading out the door.  </P> <P> Chow: Nouvelle Chinese. Chicken on a stick, doughy things that were half  potsticker, half knish; delicious beef ribs.  </P> <P> Favors: GQ shopping bags with T-shirts and the January issue inside. Early  arrivals got postage stamp-sized lapel pins, miniature replicas of the magazine  cover.  </P> <P> Triumphs: The party buzz indicated that the China Club is a hit. The real test  will come when another New York transplant club, B.C., opens soon.  </P> <P> Glitches: At times the action was faster and more furious than on the Forum  hardwood. Full-court presses with drinks and lit cigarettes made circling the  room tough, if not impossible. KEVIN ALLMAN  </P></p>

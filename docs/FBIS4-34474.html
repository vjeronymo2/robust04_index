			<p>BFN     [Text] Ottawa, 20 Jun (PL) -- Canadian Foreign Minister  Andre Ouellet, announcing that his government is convinced it is  "time to turn another page" in terms of relations with Cuba,  today put an end to 16 years of suspending financial aid to Cuba.    "The Cold War is over," Ouellet said as he announced the  resumption of official assistance to Cuba. Canada stopped  aiding Cuba in 1978 after Cuba decided to give military aid to  Angola in light of South African aggression.    Ouellet's announcement came at a time when Christine  Stewart,  Canadian minister of state for Latin America and Africa, was in  Havana attending an economic conference on Cuba sponsored by the  British publication THE ECONOMIST.    Official sources in this capital confirmed to the media that  Stewart had planned to formally announce in Havana the  resumption of Canadian aid to Cuba.</p>

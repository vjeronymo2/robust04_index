			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / Survey of Malaysia (15): Guarding a dwindling asset - State profile, The forests of Sarawak IN SARAWAK, the richly forested area of north-western Borneo which forms the largest state in Malaysia, it is hard to escape the sight of logs or the hotly-contested debate on logging. The Sarawak authorities regard foreign and local environmentalists, human rights activists and journalists as interfering hypocrites who fail to appreciate the importance of the forestry industry to the local economy, and who romanticise the primitive lifestyles of the inhabitants of the jungle. The forest dwellers themselves complain that their ancestral lands are being ravaged to fill the pockets of a few timber tycoons, while the environmentalists warn that continued over-logging will not only damage the global environment but also finish the local timber industry in a matter of years. It would be too much to speak of a meeting of minds, but there are signs that the chasm between the two sides is beginning to narrow. Although Sarawak officials still say foreigners have no business worrying about the state's forests, it is beginning to dawn on them that they are heavily dependent on a dwindling resource. With a certain amount of mental gymnastics, they maintain that Sarawak's forests are being sustainably and selectively logged, at the same time as promising to reduce logging to theoretically sustainable levels suggested by groups such as the International Tropical Timber Organisation (Itto). 'There's a very definite perception everywhere that it's finite,' says a business executive in the Sarawak capital Kuching. 'People are beginning to realise this.' Statistics on the logging industry are notoriously controversial. Suffice it to say that Malaysia accounts for nearly half of world timber exports (compared with Brazil's 2.4 per cent), that Sarawak accounts for most of Malaysia's production, and that Sarawak's unprocessed log exports have risen to 15.8m cubic metres in 1991 from 6.7m in 1980. The World Bank reckons the trees are being cut at about four times the sustainable rate. Anecdotal evidence is as telling as the statistics. Logging companies seeking valuable trees are working in increasingly remote areas as supplies closer to the coast become scarce. Fifteen years ago, according to locals in the building trade, it was common to use a soft, decorative wood known as Ramin for ornate ceilings; nowadays it is almost unobtainable, and a substitute called Bindang - which is more grainy and less consistent in its colouring - is used instead, but even this is becoming harder to find. One of the obstacles to bringing the logging industry under control is the close relationship between the loggers and the state government of Mr Abdul Taib bin Mahmud, the chief minister for the past decade. Mr Taib's uncle and political rival, Mr Abdul Rahman Yakub, let it be known during an election campaign in 1987 that his nephew's relatives and political allies controlled 1.6m hectares of the state's timber concessions, about a third of the total. Mr James Wong, the state environment minister, is also one of the largest concessionaires and has come into conflict with local inhabitants seeking to stop the depredations of his logging trucks. There are signs, however, that the Sarawak government - noting the economic problems faced by the greatly deforested neighbouring state of Sabah - is seeking to enforce stricter controls on the logging industry and to diversify the economy. First, Sarawak is encouraging the establishment of downstream wood industries and setting aside timber processing zones in an attempt to add value to its exports to Japan and other tropical timber consumers. A fifth of timber exports are now supposed to be processed in Sarawak, a proportion which is expected to rise to 50 per cent in the next few years. Sarawak is also trying to lure non-timber industries to Sarawak from peninsular Malaysia. Second, there is a drive to encourage tourism in the state, particularly 'adventure tourism' which takes advantage of Sarawak's rivers and jungles. Third, the state is promoting the conversion of forest land to palm oil plantations and other forms of agriculture, and the Sarawak Economic Development Corporation (SEDC) is overseeing an aquaculture project producing tiger prawns. 'We are pioneering a lot of industries, diversifying away from our traditional resource base,' says Mr Jeffrey Wei, of the SEDC. Sarawak is rich in oil and gas, but the revenue from these resources - unlike the revenue from timber - goes mostly to the federal government. The relationship between Sarawak and the Malaysian peninsula across the South China Sea has long been delicate. Sarawak, run by the Brooke family of White Rajahs until the arrival of the Japanese in the second world war and then ceded to Britain, joined the new Malaysian federation in 1963, whereas the neighbouring Sultanate of Brunei chose to become independent rather than sacrifice control of its oil revenues. Sarawak did, however, retain a measure of autonomy, and to this day has its own immigration controls and requires west Malaysians to obtain permits if they wish to work in the state. The 1.6m inhabitants of Sarawak - drawn from more than two dozen ethnic groups, including the local farmers and nomads collectively known as Dayaks  -complain in general that the federal government does not give them sufficient funds, and in particular that the planned tar road across east Malaysia has yet to be completed. Even if Sarawak's independent policies on its forests undermine the grand environmental targets announced at international meetings by Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the federal prime minister, the two governments appear to see eye to eye on the desirability of ignoring foreign environmentalists and 'civilising' the few hundred nomadic Penans who continue to oppose the intrusions of loggers in their ancestral lands. The Penans - described by one western diplomat in Kuala Lumpur as 'a very primitive tribe with tremendously good public relations' - have become an international symbol of the fight against uncontrolled logging in Sarawak. Sahabat Alam Malaysia (Friends of the Earth) has accused the Sarawak government of flouting public promises made over the last five years to set aside reserves for the Penan. In its latest bulletin, the organisation quoted Mr Along Saga, a Penan chief on the Adang River, as saying: 'Everywhere there are logging activities, except the small area adjacent to the fisheries station near our settlement where government ministers sometimes come by helicopter for fishing.' The logs, it seems, will continue to leave Sarawak, but the arguments over logging will not.  --------------------------------------------------------------------              VALUE OF SARAWAK EXPORTS (MDOLLARS M)  --------------------------------------------------------------------                                  1980      1985      1990      1991 Crude petroleum               2,286.5   3,125.2   2,949.1   2,902.4 Petroleum products              521.2     521.2     671.4     711.9 Liquefied natural gas               -   2,299.7   2,634.8   3,448.3 Logs                            816.5   1,403.5   2,882.9   3,143.5 Sawn timber                     104.0      58.8     251.7     383.1 Major agricultural products*    232.2     257.9     271.2     252.9 Urea                                -       3.5     155.7     237.6 Others                          373.5     777.0   1,466.7   2,114.3 Total                         4,041.4   8,446.8  11,283.5    13,194  -------------------------------------------------------------------- *includes white and black pepper, rubber, crude palm oil and cocoa  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: State Planning Unit  --------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

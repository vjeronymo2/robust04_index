			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / International Company News: March group in Pta50bn utility sales MARCH GROUP, the Spanish family-owned conglomerate, is seeking to raise Pta50bn (Dollars 490m) from the sale of electric utility interests. The hydroelectric energy business, which is based in the Pyrenees and has an installed capacity of 300MW has been offered to Endesa, the state-controlled utility and also to Iberdrola, the rival utility which is privately owned. The disposal is the first affecting Aragonesas, a group acquired in 1988 by Uralita, a leading construction material company controlled by the March group. The disposal, expected to raise up to Pta50bn, is the biggest yet planned by the March group. Last year, the March family, whose interests span banking as well as industry, sold its minority stake in Finanzauto, the top public works machinery distributor in Spain. Madrid analysts said yesterday that the move appeared aimed at breaking up Aragonesas, which is expected to make a loss for 1991. They added that there was now a question mark over the future of Aragonesas' chemical assets which were supplied directly by the electricity producer. The utility contributed about a third to Aragonesas' Pta3.36bn profits in 1990. But the company has been hit by sharply reduced earnings at its PVC manufacturer, Aiscondel.</p>

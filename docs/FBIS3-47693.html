			<p>Language: <F P=105>Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Press statement (tamhwa) issued by Yang Hyong-sop, </F> alternate member of the Political Bureau of the Workers Party of  Korea Central Committee and chairman of the Supreme People's  Assembly, on 15 January; place not given -- read by announcer]    [Text] Today our nation is faced with the important task of  advancing the cause of the fatherland's reunification through  the united strength of the whole nation.    In his historical New Year's address, the great leader  Comrade Kim Il-song taught that all Korean fellow countrymen of  the North, South, and overseas must unite as one under the  banner of the great national unity to carry out the nationwide  struggle so that a new phase can be opened this year in the  fatherland's reunification.    Currently, our people are infinitely encouraged by the great  leader's New Year's address and are vigorously carrying out the  struggle to achieve the country's socialist construction and the  fatherland's reunification starting with the beginning of the  year. The South Korean people and fellow countrymen overseas are  also actively taking part in the struggle to achieve  reunification in the nineties embraced with the new enthusiasm  for the fatherland's reunification.    Right at this time, in his New Year's news conference on 12  January, Yi Ki-taek, executive chairman of South Korea's  Democractic Party [DP], expressed concern over the current  South-North relations and the will to meet the great leader by  personally visiting Pyongyang to improve South-North relations,  which are at a stalemate.    I recognize that Executive Chairman Yi Ki-taek's will to  visit Pyongyang is motivated by his ardent patriotic sentiment,  which is naturally possessed by people who worry over the fate  of the country and nation. I express support for and welcome it.    Our Republic's Government has for a long time transcended  differences in ideology, ideas, and systems to promote great  national unity. With the desire of reunifying the fatherland,  our Republic's Government put forth bilateral and multilateral  negotiations of responsible politicians of the North and South  and, thus, exerted sincere efforts to realize it.    I believe that now is the time when responsible politicians  of the North and South must gather together to dissolve the  acute confrontational relations within the nation and jointly  seek ways to open a new phase in the country's peace and  peaceful reunification.    If South Korea's DP Executive Chairman Yi Ki-taek visits  Pyongyang with this purpose, we will welcome him with all our  hearts and will open-mindedly discuss with him the nation's  matter of grave concern. I express the hope that Executive  Chairman Yi Ki-taek will visit Pyongyang as his first trip this  year for national reconciliation, unity, and the country's  reunification in line with the desire of the whole nation.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] JAKARTA, April 20 (AFP) -- Sporadic strikes  continued outside the Sumatran city of Medan on Wednesday, but  emotions in the city appeared calmer as it remained quiet into  the afternoon following a day of anti-ethnic Chinese rioting.    Potential trouble-makers may have been discouraged by what  witnesses said was an extremely heavy security presence  throughout the city.    "Security in Medan appears to be under control (but) many  laborers are still refusing to return to work," said Alamsyah  Hamdani, a lawyer for the Medan chapter of the Legal Aid  Institute (LBH).    Hamdani, speaking by telephone from Medan, said his office  had received reports that hundreds of workers were still  refusing to return to work and had gathered outside their  factory in nearby Binjai town despite efforts by local security  personnel to disperse them.    He said many workers at the Industrial Zone of Medan, north  of the city, had also refused to work, idling their factories.    "It seems like most of the factories there have not reopen@d  yet," Hamdani said.    Another LBH lawyer, Hasbi Ansori, said strikes were also  continuing to the east of Medan in Tanjung Morawa town, although  shops were reopening under tight security after violent protests  there Tuesday.    Witnesses said the strikes outside Medan did not appear to  have an anti-Chinese element, and were aimed only at backing  continued demands for better pay and working conditions [word  indistinct] right to organize independent trade unions.    In Medan, a retailer confirmed that many shopping centers,  independent shops and supermarkets in the downtown area had  reopened under tight security after hurriedly closing down  Tuesday when a mob looted a major shopping mall owned by a  prominent ethnic-Chinese businessman, Tanoto Sukanto.    Hamdani said that there had been several other incidents  Tuesday besides the attack on Sukanto's downtown Thamrin Plaza,  which involved between 1,000 and 2,000 people armed with  machetes, iron picks and other weapons.    Witnesses said the riot was contained only after security  forces sealed off the area. Other shops and offices throughout  the area closed.    Medan had just quieted down from anti-Chinese riots which  followed a mass workers' demonstrations Thursday and Friday and  degenerated into violence, leaving one ethnic Chinese  businessman dead and scores of Chinese-owned businesses sacked.    There is widespread resentment in parts of Indonesia against  the country's wealthy ethnic Chinese minority, which constitutes  only three percent of the population but controls a  disproportionate share of economic activity.    Anti-Chinese pamphlets that first appeared during Thursday's  mass protest alleged that ethnic Chinese were accumulating  wealth to the detriment of other Indonesians, and were still in  circulation, witnesses said.</p>

			<p>921128 FT  28 NOV 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Income generators THOSE who want to build a high income might find the temporary annuity a valuable tool writes John Authers. Temporary annuities, offered by life insurance companies, take a capital sum and, in return, guarantee fixed income payments over a fixed period. This income is high, as your capital, as well as interest earned by the life company, is repaid over the period. If you die before the term is completed the life company keeps the rest of the money. This is not generally a deal worth much consideration in its own right. But a temporary annuity can be useful when combined with another investment aimed at capital growth. Such annuities are sold as part of easy-payment packages for school fees and residential care bills, but can be used in any package aimed at securing long-term growth while maintaining a regular income. The income is secure and known in advance, and so is the term. A typical 'back-to-back' scheme would put a chunk of money into a temporary annuity, and then put the remainder into a growth investment - typically a Personal Equity Plan (Pep), with-profits bond or Business Expansion Scheme company. Mark Bolland, of Chamberlain De Broe, says there can be big tax advantages, because annuity income is taxed on the assumption that most of it is return of capital. Combine this with a tax-efficient growth investment and your tax bill has been cut. What rates can you earn from a temporary annuity? Rates will improve slightly as you grow older, and you can also choose between level annuities or escalating contracts, where the income rises by a fixed amount each year, having started from a lower base. According to Peter Quinton of the Annuity Bureau, the best rates for a five-year level annuity for a man aged 40 come from RNPF Nurses with Pounds 2,557 annually, followed by Pearl Assurance with Pounds 2,444 and Standard Life with Pounds 2,387. Rates for women tend to be lower, reflecting greater life expectancy. Over nine years, using the same assumptions, Pearl leads, according to Quinton, with Pounds 1,691, followed by RNPF Nurses on Pounds 1,684.</p>

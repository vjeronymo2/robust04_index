			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: British Airways BA is delighted that the first Dollars 300m stage of its investment in USAir has been temporarily approved. In truth, the US transportation secretary had no alternative under existing aviation agreements. The crucial question is: what follows? Mr Federico Pena will press hard for a revised bilateral aviation agreement with the UK government giving US carriers greater access to the European market. BA will then face a tricky calculation whether to cede some Heathrow slots in the hope of receiving US regulatory approval for the next two phases of its link up with USAir. These stages would bring the real operational rewards. But such considerations may be academic. In its current mood, the US Congress would bristle at approving any agreement allowing BA fuller access to the domestic market no matter what Mr Pena may agree.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 27 Apr (MENA)--President Husni Mubarak has  asked the Yemeni leaders to exercise self-restraint and to avoid  intensifying the problems in Yemen. He warned of the gravity of  any escalation in the situation and any acts of violence.    Mubarak made this statement during two telephone calls he  received this afternoon from Yemeni Vice President 'Ali Salim  al-Bid and from Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih. He told  Salih and al-Bid that confrontation between Yemeni brothers and  forces will be detrimental to Yemeni interests and will threaten  the country's security, stability, and unity of its sons. He  called for settling their differences through dialogue and  reason.</p>

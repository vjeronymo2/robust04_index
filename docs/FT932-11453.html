The agreement in principle is the latest sign of expansion at MIN since the Pounds 125m management buy-out from Ingersoll Newspapers in November 1991 and will give the group titles in all areas of the East and West Midlands. Last year MIN, the main business of which includes the Sunday Mercury and Coventry Evening Telegraph as well as the Post and Mail, acquired 18 titles and launched five more. The group will also announce today an increase in operating profit on its newspaper activities from Pounds 5.8m to Pounds 13.2m in the year to December.</p>

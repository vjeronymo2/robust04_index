			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Trusts and their uses Preserving wealth. Large sums of money need effective management to provide income and capital growth. You might feel that your surviving spouse or children could be tempted to spend too much too quickly and not know how to manage money, nor know who to appoint to manage it for them. Controlling wealth - say, providing for a dependant during his or her life while also preserving the capital for others. For example, a trust can provide for a wife for life and, thereafter, for the children. Providing pensions for retired employees and their dependants. Facilitating investment through unit trusts. Trustees can buy holdings in several companies and invite the public to buy 'units' or shares in the trust fund. Making provision for causes or non-human objects. Making a secret provision, such as for an out-of-wedlock child or lover. Enabling land to be held for people who cannot own it personally. Reducing tax in the UK and abroad. Protecting assets from creditors (but only if the trust was set up without this in mind.) Avoiding the fixed succession rules of other countries.</p>

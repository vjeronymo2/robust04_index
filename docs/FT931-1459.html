			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / UK Company News: BSG increases to Pounds 12m and plans Pounds 31m rights BSG INTERNATIONAL, the motor components, vehicle distribution, childcare products and aircraft interior equipment group, announced an 8 per cent increase in profits for 1992 together with a 1-for-4 rights issue to raise Pounds 31.4m to fund planned capital investment. The pre-tax outcome was Pounds 12m, compared with Pounds 11.1m, helped by a strong performance from its Australian component plants, healthy demand in Germany and a recovery in its car leasing and Birmingham dealer operations following rationalisation. The rights issue, underwritten by Morgan Grenfell and brokered by Panmure Gordon, is priced at 62p, a discount of 19.5 per cent to the overnight market price of 77p. Yesterday the shares closed at 70p. The fund-raising comes against the background of capital spending plans for 1993 and 1994 of Pounds 34m. Of this Pounds 12m will be spent on a mirror plant in the US and Pounds 7m on a Vauxhall dealership in Manchester and the relocation of a Ford dealership in Cheltenham. Without a rights issue to fund expansion, 'gearing would have got out of hand; we needed it for future growth,' said Mr Tom Cannon, managing director. Gearing at the end of 1992 was 49 per cent. Proceeds of the rights issue would have cut it at that time to 13.7 per cent. Both BSG's capital expenditure and its research and development spending have been sustained through the recession. R&amp;D costs, charged against trading profits, will be no less this year than the Pounds 8.9m spent in 1992. Turnover was Pounds 555.1m, down from Pounds 569.8m, reflecting deterioration in trading in the final quarter, especially in the UK. However, so far this year there has been a slight imrpovement in orders across all sectors of the business, although Mr Cannon observed that problems with margins remained at LA Rumbold, the aircraft interiors company. The final dividend is 2.5p, maintaining the total at 3.2p. Although covered by earnings per share of 3.46p, against 3.32p, part of the cost will come from reserves following discontinued business charges of Pounds 1.9m taken below the line.</p>

			<p><P> August 15, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> KILLEA'S DIAPER LABELING BILL FAILS TO ATTRACT NEEDED VOTES  </P> <P> A proposal by Sen. Lucy Killea (D-San Diego) to require environmental warning  labels on packages of disposable diapers died -- again -- when it failed to  garner enough votes Tuesday in the Assembly Ways and Means Committee. However,  it could be brought up for reconsideration today.  </P> <P> The committee voted 8-7 to scuttle Killea's measure requiring a label on  disposable diaper packages warning that "single-use disposable diapers create  significant environmental problems and costs to the community when disposed."  The bill would have required manufacturers to label diaper packages by Jan. 1,  1992, or face a $50 fine per package.  </P> <P> Killea's measure has received strong opposition from Proctor &amp; Gamble, the  makers of Pampers disposables, and Kimberly-Clark, makers of Huggies, who claim  the bill unfairly singles out disposable diapers as an environmental hazard.  The companies have argued that the alternative being touted by Killea --  old-fashioned cloth diapers -- is even more environmentally offensive because  they dirty six times more water during cleaning than disposable diapers, which  are designed to be rinsed once before being thrown away.  </P> <P> "The whole objective is to put a user of the product on a guilt trip," Gene  Hill, Kimberly-Clark's regional director of state government relations, said  about Killea's measure.  </P> <P> Killea, however, says the water claims are exaggerated, and underscored to  legislative colleagues Tuesday that her measure is not a tax or a ban. She said  it is a way to educate consumers about the environmental consequences of  disposable diapers, which account for 2% of the solid wastes generated each  year by Californians. She says the 2.5 million single-use diapers thrown away  annually by Californians would be enough to pave Interstate 5 from the Mexican  border to Oregon.  </P> <P> The conflicting claims prompted Assemblyman Jack O'Connell (D-Carpinteria) to  observe that the disposable diaper debate represented "two environmental  problems coming to a loggerhead -- the disposal issue versus water use."  O'Connell, considered sympathetic to recycling issues, represents  drought-stricken Santa Barbara.  </P> <P> Voting against the measure was Assemblywoman Sunny Mojonnier (R-Encinitas), who  claimed the Killea bill would also have required labels on incontinent supplies  for the elderly. Diapers for the elderly are exactly the same product, only  bigger, she said.  </P> <P> The label proposal was killed in the Senate. But it was restored last month by  another Assembly committee before being sent along in the legislative process.  California is one of 25 states considering measures to label or ban disposable  diapers.  </P></p>

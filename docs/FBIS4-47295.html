Zvereva, All-Russian Science Center  ``State Institute of Optics imeni S.I. Vavilov''; UDC  666.1.056:620.197]    [Abstract] Studies made concerning protection of optical  surfaces against detrimental biological agents, specifically  defects caused by fungi, have revealed that conventional  volatile fungicides and fungistats do inhibit mold formation on  optical glasses, but also either form films of a less  transparent condensates on the glass surface or corrode metal  parts of the fixtures. A mixture of dimethyl diethoxysilane and  antiseptic N- cyclohexyl dichloromaleate in acetone-alcohol  solution was proposed in 1985, but later found to be inadequate  and also to form a fine-polycrystalline layer rather than a  desirable continuous condensate film when exposed to water vapor  in the air. While new fungicidal thin coatings are being  synthesized, a rational and comprehensive procedure for  evaluating their effectiveness is being followed which includes  measuring their fungicidal power, spectral characteristics of  their optical properties, also their critical contact angle with  water and thus their effect on the surface wettability in water.  Included are further chemical analysis, mechanical tests, and  environmental tests under conditions as severe as a humid  subtropical climate. In this way have been and still are being  developed bioactive organoelemental compounds for film-forming  hydrophobic fungicidal coatings. They must not influence the  performance characteristics of an optical device and not corrode  its metal parts, they must remain stable during storage at room  temperature, must be readily producible and not be a scarce  commodity. They must also be ecologically harmless. A technology  of producing them in a single process stage has been developed,  high-molecular compounds being successfully used for surface  modification of optical glasses. Addition of a film-forming  YRSiX[.sub]3[/] monomer (Y- Hg,Sn, or substitute atom; R-  alkyl group; X- hydrolyzable group) and mercury acetate or  organostannosiloxane on top of a film-forming polymer of the  polyorganosiloxane elastomer (synthetic caoutchoucs) group will  ensure long lasting comprehensive protection, owing to  cooperative action and effective hydrophobization. Enrichment  caoutchouc with OH-groups prior to its deposition on glass will,  moreover, strengthen its adhesion to the optical surface. Tables  2; references 9.</p>

			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / Funds threat to Canada's peace forces CANADA'S military authorities have warned that the country's United Nations peacekeeping operations are being threatened by cuts in government spending. Canada is the second-largest contributor to UN peacekeeping, after France. It has 4,300 troops, about a tenth of the total, in 15 different UN contingents. With an estimated 20-25 per cent of defence resources now earmarked for UN missions, the Defence Department has indicated it requires a big increase in its 1993/94 budget if it is to maintain Canada's commitment. Mr Marcel Masse, defence minister, told a Senate committee in Ottawa: 'It's not a question of will, it's a question of dollars.' The department has been among the heaviest casualties of recent government spending cuts. The number of Canadian peacekeepers does not include replacement forces training in the country concerned, nor air and naval support operations, such as aircraft ferrying relief supplies in Yugoslavia and Somalia. Mr Masse said the peacekeeping bill was CDollars 170m (Pounds 87.6m) over budget so far this year. The mission in Yugoslavia, involving 2,400 Canadian troops, has been a particular drain as individual countries are paying the full cost of participation in the peacekeeping effort. Mr Alex Morrison, director of the Canadian Institute for Strategic Studies, forecast yesterday that the number of Canadian peacekeepers would increase further next year, but probably at the expense of other military commitments. 'There is a bias towards participating,' he said. Ottawa has begun to scale down its 500-troop contribution to the UN force in Cyprus. However, General John de Chastelain, chief of defence staff, said Canada had been approached to take part in possible UN missions in Macedonia and Mozambique.</p>

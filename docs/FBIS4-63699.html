			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow May 24 TASS -- President Boris Yeltsin  received visiting British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd in the  Kremlin on Tuesday, the presidential press service reports.    The sides discussed European security, cooperation between  Russia and the west, including NATO's "partnership for peace"  programme. The president stressed that cooperation between  Russia and NATO is of mutual interest and should be carried on  with the understanding of Russia's specific features as a great  power.    Yeltsin expressed hope for the earliest completion of talks  and the signing of agreements between Russia and the European  Union on Russia's entry into GATT. He also pointed to the need  for Russia's full-fledged participation in setting up a new  organisation on export controls after COCOM ended its functions.    In connection with the question on the situation in the  Crimea, which was raised by Hurd, Yeltsin confirmed Russia's  known position on this issue: The Crimea's problems should be  settled between Kiev and Simferopol through negotiations, in  line with the principles of the Conference on Security and  Cooperation in Europe, without the use of force.    The sides also examined in detail the state of  Russian-British relations, noting that contacts between the two  countries are being exercised at an unprecedentedly high level.    Hurd conveyed a message to Yeltsin from Queen Elizabeth II  where her majesty accepts an earlier invitation to make  history's first official visit to Russia in autumn 1994.</p>

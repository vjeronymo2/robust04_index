			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / International Company News: Generale des Eaux lines up chief Mr Jean-Marie Messier, a 37-year-old partner at Lazard Freres, the merchant bank, is likely to become the next head of Generale des Eaux, the French utilities and communications group. His appointment is expected to be announced within the next few weeks. The appointment comes at the recommendation of Mr Guy Dejouany, the 73-year-old chairman who is due to retire shortly from his post. However, the move will require ratification at a forthcoming meeting of the board of directors. The change partly reflects a desire by the group for a more youthful management. Mr Messier is a member of the Inspecteurs des Finances, the elite French administrative corps, and advised the government on its privatisation programme before joining the private sector. Shares in the group rose slightly at the end of last week following speculation in the French press of Mr Messier's appointment. The group last month reported net profits of FFr1.26bn (Dollars 244.2m), up 5.4 per cent, in the first half of the year.</p>

Foreign  Ministry spokesman Terusuke Terada said Japan wants to closely  watch the deliberations at the convention, which resumed Tuesday  after adjournments four times.    The Japanese Government hopes that progress will be made in  the deliberations and that democracy will be achieved as soon as  possible, he said.    Myanmar's military junta, the State Law and Order  Restoration  Council (SLORC), has nullified the results of a 1990 election in  which Nobel prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi's National League  for Democracy won a landslide victory, and has said elections  will be held after a new constitution is adopted.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa held a meeting  over dinner with Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura and  Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Hatoyama at a restaurant in  Tokyo on 20 April. Commenting on the concept of the "national  welfare tax," which he proposed last February and later  retracted, the prime minister revealed that despite his own  intentions, the bureaucracy, including the Finance Ministry, had  exerted stronger influence. For example, he said: "I tried to  take advantage of the Finance Ministry and other government  agencies to achieve my goals. However, it turned out that I was  the one who was exploited by the bureaucrats. I was swayed by  what they said."    In connection with the news conference on the announcement  of  the national welfare tax being held in the early hours of 3  February, Takemura said: "I ran all over the place to try to  stop the news conference." In response, Hosokawa reportedly  indicated he "learned his lesson," saying: "I should have not  held the news conference at all. I should have postponed it  until the next day. It was unreasonable."    That night, however, when rumors of Hosokawa's remarks  spread  through Nagato-cho [the district in Tokyo where the Diet  building is located], the prime minister telephoned Takemura and  asked him "not to disclose the details." Thus, the relations  between the prime minister and the chief cabinet secretary  remained awkward until the very end.</p>

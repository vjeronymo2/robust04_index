			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with south Yemen "Defense Minister" Staff </F> Brigadier General Haytham Qasim Tahir by Lutfi Shatarah; place  and date not given]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Shatarah] You have on  numerous occasions raised the question of Iraqi, Sudanese,  Jordanian, and Eritrean involvement in the ongoing war between  northern and southern forces. Is there irrefutable evidence of  this involvement, given that Iraq says that the prisoners are  teachers?    [Tahir] I can -- regrettably -- confirm to you that Iraq is  implicated and a partner in this war against our people. Iraq  is involved directly through its military experts and soldiers  who are fighting alongside northern forces. A number of them  have been captured, and Iraq could not deny this. The war is --  beyond any doubt -- basically run by Iraqi experts, and 'Ali  'Abdallah Salih considers himself a new Saddam, or as brother  President 'Ali Salim al-Bid described him, "a little Saddam."    We have irrefutable evidence of Jordan's implication in the  war alongside 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and against our people in the  Democratic Republic of Yemen [DRY]. Sudan too is participating  directly or indirectly in this war, proceeding from the close  relations between Sudan and North Yemen, where parties,  fundamentalist groups, and influential military leaders are in  control of power.    And you know that Afghan jihad elements are fighting  alongside northern forces on a number of fronts.    As for the Iraqi prisoners issue, it merits interest and a  pause for consideration. Let us explain the scenario and the  contradictory statements made by both North Yemen and Iraq.  Initially, Sanaa and Baghdad categorically denied Iraq's  participation in the war. When Iraqi prisoners, who were  captured on the Shabwah-Hadhramaut military axis, appeared on  television, Sanaa claimed that they were nurses who had been  arrested at al-Hutah hospital in Lahij Governorate to be used as  prisoners. As not even children or madmen would believe this  story, Baghdad had to admit the presence of Iraqi military  personnel contracted privately to join the Yemeni Army. So one  of them bore witness to that.    [Shatarah] The northern Air Force's resumption of activities  in the fighting has probably dashed your hopes that the early  southern air strikes neutralized the northern Air Force.    [Tahir] Actually the northern Air Force's role has been  limited, not completely paralyzed. Not only because of the  crushing air strikes our Air Force launched against military  airports in Sanaa, al-Hudaydah, and Ta'izz -- which destroyed a  large number of aircraft as well as these airports, and thus  paralyzed the effectiveness of the northern Air Force -- but  also because the combat preparedness of the northern Air Force  was very limited.    But it was the Iraqi and Jordanian aid and expertise which  --  to some extent -- have restored the effectiveness of the  northern Air Force recently. Nevertheless, all the air raids  launched by the aircraft of the military regime in Sanaa have so  far failed to inflict any damage on military targets, that is  with the exception of the damage to the fuel tanks in the Aden  refinery and the damage to a part of the electrothermal station,  water tanks, and the homes of peaceful citizens. [passage  omitted]    [Shatarah] The northern leadership accused you of signing  an arms deal with North Korea which includes tanks, artillery,  and Sukhoy aircraft. What truth is there in this?    [Tahir] That accusation is absolutely baseless. And you can  refer to the statement made by the official spokesman for the  North Korean Foreign Ministry, who categorically denied that  accusation.    All the accusations Sanaa is leveling at us are designed for  the media and to divert attention from the military aid and arms  deals it has obtained and is obtaining from a number of states,  including Iraq and Iran.    [Shatarah] How did northern forces manage to reach the  approaches of Aden? And do you expect the city to be captured  by the northerners?    [Tahir] First, I repeat that the military regime in Sanaa  prepared and planned for this war very early, while we were not  prepared. Nor did we expect such an all-out war.    Second, 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and his advisers planned to  occupy all the south. His forces attacked all border areas  between the two parts [of Yemen]. He had thought that the  situation would be settled within two or three days at the most.  You remember the various statements he and his ministers made  about settling the situation within 24, 48, or 72 hours. But  the hours, days, and weeks have elapsed and nothing has happened.    It means that 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's forces reached the  approaches of Aden on after they suffered huge losses in both  lives and equipment. But the military strategic aims of the war  have failed completely. They have been broken on the rock of  the steadfastness of our forces, which are defending bravely and  steadfastly. The attack on Aden has failed, and northern forces  have failed to advance as a result of our forces' steadfastness  and death defiance.    In search of another shelter, the military regime in Sanaa  is  haphazardly and barbarously bombarding residential areas in Aden  Governorates and vital economic installations by artillery,  rockets, and aircraft. [passage omitted]    [Shatarah] You said in a local newspaper that there is  internal treason. Can you specify it? And why did it happen?    [Tahir] It is very natural for infiltrations to happen here  and there, as everyone considered themselves people of one  state, and they dealt with one another innocently. Besides,  'Ali 'Abdallah Salih has been pursuing the divide-and-rule  principle. He has earnestly tried to create and fuel further  splits and disputes in a bid to influence the internal front.    At any rate, those who joined the ranks of the military  regime in Sanaa can be counted on the fingers of one hand and  they have had no serious effect on the combat position of our  forces, who have very bravely fought a brutal aggression in an  all-out war which was planned and prepared for long ago.    [Shatarah] In your capacity as DRY defense minister, what  are your priorities at the moment?    [Tahir] We are still engaged in the war imposed on us by the  military regime in Sanaa. When victory has been achieved, God  willing, we will begin our first tasks, first and foremost  rebuilding and reorganizing our Armed Forces on modern  scientific foundations so as to fulfill the requirements of the  defense of our country and its national sovereignty. [passage  omitted]    [Shatarah] Why is the south insisting on bringing  international observers to supervise the cease-fire?    [Tahir] We have bitter experience with 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih  and his military regime with regard to promises, treaties, and  agreements.    We signed more than 100 agreements with him, none of which  has been implemented. The most recent is the Pledge and Accord  Document signed in the Jordanian capital, Amman, on 20 February.  It was circumvented on the day it was signed. The regime in  Sanaa suffers from a split personality with regard to words and  actions. So we cannot rely on any agreement with 'Ali 'Abdallah  Salih, because he has lost all credibility and respects no  pledge or agreement.    There is another reason: we are now an independent state and  the war is between two states, and it is natural for us to refer  our issue to the international organization.    [Shatarah] What measures will you take if Sanaa continues to  attack vital installations in Aden or if it storms the city and  rejects international initiatives?    [Tahir] Sanaa is still attacking vital economic  installations in Aden and residential areas, just as it attacked  villages and cities during its occupation.    We will not be able to stand with our hands tied if it  continues its actions, which contravene the rules of war and  human rights. As for storming Aden, it is impossible. And if  Sanaa continues to rejects all international initiative, it is  going to pay a very high price.</p>

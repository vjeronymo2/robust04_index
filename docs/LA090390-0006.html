			<p><P> September 3, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REDUCING CLASS SIZES IN CALIFORNIA  </P> <P> Gov. Deukmejian said, "Ever since I've been governor, I've been getting nothing  but complaints about class size." Perhaps if the governor had to work  effectively with 35-40 other employees sharing his office, he would reconsider  his priorities and realize class size in our public schools is an extremely  important issue that must be dealt with now!  </P> <P> BARBARA JAFFE  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

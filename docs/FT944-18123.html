			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / People: New style for fashion retailer New Look New Look, the Dorset-based women's wear retailer which has just opened its first London outlet on Oxford Street, is preparing itself for flotation by bringing on to its board a non-executive chairman and two non-executive directors. Unusually, founder Tom Singh has retained for himself only the position of deputy chairman; John Hanna, the managing director, is in day-to-day charge. The new chairman, 53-year-old Louis Sherwood, right, has been picked not for his experience in fashion but for his knowledge of retailing generally. A former personal assistant to James Gulliver at Fine Fare, Sherwood then spent 13 years in Sir James Goldsmith's empire, initially with Anglo-Continental, later in the US at Grand Union. In 1985 he became president of US supermarket chain A&amp;P, returning to the UK three years later to be chairman and chief executive of Gateway Foodmarkets. Following Isoceles' acquisition of Gateway in 1989, he was brought in by the bankers as non-executive chairman following the ill-fated management buy-out of Magnet, the fitted kitchens retailer. He is now chairman of HTV Group, the ITV company for the west of England and Wales. Also joining the board is Howard Perlin, a non-executive director of Pentos, who until March had been director of acquisitions and disposals at Sears. Perlin, 47, says he was impressed by New Look: 'It appears to have eliminated the sort of hiccups you so often see in the fashion business'. Sales have grown by an average annual compound rate of about 50 per cent a year for the past five years. The feminine perspective is provided by 38-year-old Sue Farr, head of marketing and publicity for BBC Network Radio. A graduate trainee at Northern Foods, she moved around the advertising world before becoming director of corporate communications for Thames TV. She joined the BBC last year.</p>

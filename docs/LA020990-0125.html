			<p><P> February 9, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH;  </P> <P> ANOTHER STEP TAKEN FOR CITY ARTS CENTER  </P> <P> At the end of a stretch of new condominiums, restaurants, theaters and shops  that will make up the city's Main Pier redevelopment center, the city is  setting aside a corner for art.  </P> <P> With the City Council's approval this week of conceptual design plans,  officials are on the way toward opening the Huntington Beach Art Center in the  spring of 1991.  </P> <P> The center will be in a renovated, 39-year-old international-industrial-style  building on Main Street at Acacia Avenue. In June, 1988, the city paid $758,000  for the building, which had been used as office space for Southern California  Edison.  </P> <P> The yearlong renovation is expected to cost an additional $750,000. The  improvements will be funded by the newly formed Huntington Beach Arts Center  Foundation, a nonprofit group, according to Naida Osline, the center's  director. The foundation is raising money largely through grants and corporate  and private donations.  </P> <P> Plans call for the 11,000-square-foot center to include three galleries, a  studio for workshops and classes, a multipurpose room that will feature  performances, lectures, films and videos, and an art-related bookstore.  </P> <P> Osline said the center will exhibit paintings, sculptures and various  mixed-media art forms.  </P> <P> "We want to give people a cultural context so it means something to people, not  just something decorating the walls," she said. "We are going to try to involve  people in ideas and issues."  </P> <P> The city's only other art facilities are small galleries at Golden West College  and the Huntington Beach Central Library.  </P> <P> The new art center is the culmination of more than a decade of effort by the  city's Allied Arts Board, a council advisory committee that identified the Main  Street building in 1983. The idea took shape in 1986 when the city created a  cultural affairs division of the Community Services Department, Osline said.  </P> <P> Residents will get their first chance to tour the future art center building,  examine renovation plans and meet the center's coordinating staff at an open  house scheduled for 5 to 7 p.m. on Tuesday.

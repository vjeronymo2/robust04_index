			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / Insurer halts sales campaign The Independent Order of Foresters, a mutual life insurer, is withdrawing from the regulated retail financial services market until next summer, and will instead concentrate on trying to build up its membership. Its direct sales force, which had already fallen from 120 a year ago to 90, is to be absorbed as far as possible in an expansion of the 30-strong membership sales force. Membership advisers, who recruit people to join the insurer, do not have to be authorised to sell financial services products. Members of the Independent Order of Foresters qualify for insurance-type benefits and take part in a variety of social events. Mr Arno Kitts, the insurer's chief executive and compliance officer, said yesterday the organisation was developing a new range of membership benefits to be launched in January. Mr Kitts admitted that the level of new financial services business brought in by the sales force before the beginning of this month - when the decision to withdraw was taken - was unlikely to have been profitable. Distribution costs are an increasingly important factor in the life industry, as regulatory standards become more demanding. In June the Independent Order of Foresters was fined Pounds 200,000 by City regulators for failing to organise its business responsibly. When the organisation re-enters financial services next year, its new range of products will be sold through a separate body in order to make a clearer distinction between the different benefits for members. Mr Kitts said some 116,000 households are members of the organisation.</p>

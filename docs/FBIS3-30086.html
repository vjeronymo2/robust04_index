			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by President Kim Yong-sam with foreign and </F> domestic reporters on 25 February at the presidential residence,  Chongwadae, on the occasion of the first anniversary of his  inauguration--live ]    [Text] [Reporter Kim Chung-il from the KYONGHYANG SINMUN]  The North Korean nuclear issue which, as you said, is closely  related to the destiny of 70 million fellow countrymen has now  been handed over to the talks between the United States and  North Korea, let alone the issue of North-South dialogue.  However, in view of the positions and attitudes of North Korea  and the United States toward these negotiations, it seems very  difficult to expect that the nuclear issue will be completely  resolved at an early date. Are you ready to hold summit talks  with North Korean President Kim Il-song in an effort to settle  such a deadlock and to Koreanize the nuclear issue? Also,  various reports and speculations regarding the North Korean  issue have run rampant recently, and this has driven the people  into confusion. So, Mr. President, please make public before the  people, if possible, any intelligence concerning North Korea's  nuclear development.    [Kim Yong-sam] Thank you. Regarding the North Korean nuclear  issue, I received reports even until right before I came to this  news conference room. I mean I received reports from the United  States on the U.S.-North Korean contact which is now being held  there. The U.S.-North Korean contact which was scheduled to be  held this morning has been delayed. In the relations between the  ROK and the United States I can clearly say that the ROK and  U.S. Governments have maintained and are maintaining closer and  friendlier relations more than ever before. The two governments  are fully consulting with each other on all issues under the  pricinciple of mutual respect. Regarding the North Korean  nuclear issue, in particular, the United States has fully  consulted with the ROK in advance and sometimes in the course of  its negotiations with North Korea. So, the two countries have  made full discussions and consultation before and after the  United States held negotiations with North Korea. Therefore,  there is no case where our sovereignty is ignored or anything  like that. In other words, I can clearly say that our opinions  have been reflected.    Let me mention something about nuclear intelligence. As you  know, as the president I hear and receive much intelligence from  various channels at home and abroad. Summing up numerous  intelligence reports we have received so far we have been unable  to find clear evidence that North Korea has nuclear weapons. We  cannot clearly say that North Korea has nuclear weapons.  Another clear fact is that North Korea has continuously pushed  ahead with nuclear development without renouncing it and without  delaying it. This is also a clear fact.    By the way, although no agreement was reached until this  morning, North Korea is destined to accept the International  Atomic Energy Agency's [IAEA] inspections, and North-South  dialogue and exchange of special envoys will be realized after  all.    On the question on summit talks with President Kim Il-song,  I  will push ahead with holding summit talks with President Kim  Il-song only when holding the talks is considered to be  conducive to making North Korea renounce its nuclear development.    [KBS reporter Kim Hong] You said that you will hold summit  talks with President Kim Il-song when it is judged to be of help  in restraining the nuclear issue. Does that mean that  South-North summit talks can be held with the exchange of envoys  of the South and North in addition to the contacts that have  been held heretofore, even before the nuclear transparency is  guaranteed?    [President Kim] Yes. Originally, the North Korean side  proposed the exchange of envoys of the South and North. The  exchange of envoys was a precondition to holding summit talks.  Therefore, the exchange of envoys itself is part of holding  summit talks.    [KYONGHYANG SINMUN reporter Kim Chung-il] The proposal for  summit talks is an epoch-making proposal that may even be said  to be a change in our policy toward North Korea. Was there  special background to this matter? Also, how do you view the  timing of summit talks against the backdrop of proposing the  South-North summit talks?    [President Kim] I believe that you all know of the  tug-of-war that was carried out during the past year to resolve  the nuclear issue. However, the most important duty for me as  president is to defend the country, protect the people, and to  protect the 70 million people of the Korean peninsula from war.  Therefore, one of my important goals was to prevent nuclear  development at all costs. At the same time, I was of the strong  will that a war must not break out on the Korean peninsula.  This is a very difficult issue. Therefore, there are aspects  that need to be strongly pushed ahead as well as other aspects  that we need to strategically withdraw on. I believe that the  most important duty of the president is to allow the people to  live in security. Therefore, we must prevent North Korea's  nuclear development for strategic reasons. This must be  achieved not only for peace on the Korean peninsula but also for  peace in Northeast Asia and the rest of the world. It is also  necessary for South-North co-existence and prosperity. I have  deeply contemplated over this matter from various aspects.    [HANGUK ILBO reporter Choe Kyu-sik] Can your remark on the  South-North summit be explained as acceptance of the proposal  made by President Kim Il-song last year? Also, the South-North  summit talks brought up by President Kim Il-song is centered on  the reunification issue. Do you plan to include economic  cooperation and your three-stage reunification plan in addition  to the nuclear issue in the discussion?    [President Kim] If summit talks are held, we cannot just  talk about one issue. All issues as well as the nuclear issue  will be discussed. I believe that a deep exchange of opinions  on all issues including the issue of economic cooperation and  reunification can be held for South-North co-existence and  prosperity.    [CHUNGANG ILBO reporter Kim Hyon-il] You said that there  have been sufficient consultations between the ROK and the  United States on all issues. However, there have been various  rumors as to the deployment of Patriot missiles, which are  defensive weapons. Will you please tell us about the reason of  such rumors? You also said that if the North Korean nuclear  issue is resolved, the Team Spirit exercise will be suspended.  Please tell us whether there will be no problem in our security  posture even in time of emergency, if the exercise is suspended.    [President Kim] Some press organs have publicized this issue  in various forms. However, there are many incorrect reports.  Some papers even reported that the ROK wants to receive Patriot  missiles. However, we have never asked them. I want to clarify  at this point that the ROK has no plan to purchase Patriot  missiles.    The ROK and the United States have been conducting close  consultations on this issue, including the time of introduction.  As you know, Patriot missiles are not offensive. They are  totally purely defensive. Therefore, this is not an issue to  which one, including North Korea, should pay sensitive  attention. I believe, however, that the issue should be decided  from the political point of view, instead of the military  aspect. Thus, discussions are ongoing on this issue. I think  there will be no great problem pertaining to this, because the  United States fully respects our sovereignty. Unlike the past,  cooperation is being attained 100 percent.    As for the issue of the Team Spirit exercise, we conducted  the exercise every year in the past. However, we are  tentatively withholding it in order to make North Korea accept  IAEA inspections and to hold sincere North-South dialogue.  Therefore, in the event that all these conditions are met, the  ROK Government will announce the suspension of the exercise. The  suspension will be announced on certain conditions. We do not  mean complete suspension. Only when everything is met, the  exercise will be suspended completely.    We can conduct the Team Spirit exercise at any time we want.  As the exercise usually begins in March, a considerable amount  of troops and weapons should have already departed from the U.S.  mainland if the exercise is to be conducted. However, it is  being withheld tentatively, not being suspended forever. We will  start it again if the conditions are not met. Therefore, even if  we announce the suspension, there will be no problem in the  defense of the ROK.    [MBC reporter Cho Chong-min] I would like to ask a few  political questions. A survey revealed that the degree of  support for the president, which reached 90 percent after your  inauguration, recently declined to 60 percent. This means that  the critical view is increasing, although the figure of 60  percent itself is enormous. What reason do you see for this?  In particular, some people observe that those who were your  supporters from the past are leaving your (?camp). How do you  assess all of this?    [President Kim] I thank you the people for your continuous  over 90 percent support for me since my inauguration. It's  amazing that one could get over 90 percent support from the  people. The support was so dazzling that I felt an enormous  burden and pressure. I felt it somewhat abnormal. I thought it  should be lower than that. There should be a certain degree of  opposition in a democratic society. Now, therefore, it is  returning to normalcy. I, therefore, feel gratified for it. I  think I can work with a sense of relief now. The decisive  contributing factors to the dwindling of my popularity were the  major accidents, the contamination of drinking water from the  Naktong River--which have in fact been the result of undesirable  practices over the past 30 years--and particularly the recent  hike in the cost of living, in which the people are concerned  about most.    What I would like to say to your question is that, since I  am  not going to run for the presidency four years from now and  since my convictions do not allow me to do anything for the sake  of winning temporary popularity, if I think something is right  and is necessary for the people, I will not hesitate to do it.  This is what I have done in the past as well. As for the real  name financial transaction system, for instance, it was far from  a policy of attracting popularity. Many around me then advised  me against the real name financial transaction system, on the  ground that it should be instituted after the recovery of our  then slack economy. I turned down the idea because it would  postpone the system indefinitely, perhaps for good. I stressed  that we should do it for the sake of economic justice. We  should do it to justify wealth. We should institute the real  name financial transaction system, the key point of reform. We  should not postpone the system until the economy recovers, to  win the people's popularity. Thus, we implemented the system.    The term of the U.S. President is four years. Although one  can remain in the office for a second term, there were quite a  few presidents who did not serve a second term. For instance,  President Bush and President Carter. Today, I begin the second  year of my office as if I were making a new start. I will not  do anything to seek temporary public popularity. If I think it  beneficial to our country and people, I will not shrink from  doing it.    [TONG-A ILBO reporter Song Yong-on] I will ask you a  question on reform as a whole. Despite the sweeping audit and  inspection activities for the last year and despite the general  reform you have conducted for society as a whole, the people do  not feel tangible effects of reform in such areas as the cost of  living, environment, and transportation. Some also noted the  lack of the general program for reform. Please give us a  general outline of the program for reform for the next four  years of your term, giving us the priority list and the method  of reform.    [President Kim] Many references are made to the lack of a  program, civilian dictatorship, and one-man rule. I much doubt  the credibility of such references. During the era of military  dictatorship, dictatorship was enforced. The government of  civilian democracy is the government given birth to by the  people. It is literally the government of civilian democracy.  Under a president-centered government, the president takes the  responsibility and leads the state. The president is the person  who takes the supreme responsibility for managing the state. He  is responsible for leading the state. If anyone says this is  civilian dictatorship and uses the description One-Man Politics,  I can hardly understand it. Does he mean that we should return  to dictatorship under which we were in the past? I hope that  you will make efforts to help the people properly appreciate  matters related to this question.    As for the issue of the rise in the cost of living, I am  very  sorry that there was such an increase. The government will  concentrate its efforts to check the increase in the cost of  living. An important reason for the increase in the cost of  living was that the cold weather last year caused an increase in  farm produce prices. That has had a lot to do with the present  situation connected with the hike in the cost of living.    As you well know, some increase in prices is a common sight  in January every year. I think it is very difficult to assess a  price increase in one full year based on the price increase in  such a short period of time, that is, January. So, our  government is making every possible effort to prevent price  increases. However, what is important here is the people's  cooperation with the government's efforts. In other words, the  people should not perpetrate the practice of cornering goods or  being indisposed to sell goods. Early in January a phenomenon of  excessive spending was seen among the citizens. We can say such  a phenomenon is an act of hoarding goods and being indisposed to  sell goods. Therefore, if our people are to worry about an  increase in prices they should join the government's efforts in  settling the price problem. I urge our people's cooperation in  settling the price problem.    In dealing with economic matters, I think that we should set  priority according to the degree of importance. In connection  with the Uruguay Round issue, in addition to 42 trillion won  annually, the government plans to invest 1.5 trillion won each  year in the structural improvement project for our rural  villages by establishing special purpose taxes. At the same  time, the Agricultural Development Committee has been formed.  So, we will see to it that this committee will study in detail  how to use these funds for rural villages. Of course, in the  rural improvement project, too, we will set priority.    [TONG-A ILBO reporter Song Yong-ho] I will use the term  one-man rule in the form of a different expression because I  know you dislike that term. During the past year you have  directly and personally dealt with everything, and as a result,  the word of politics devoid of power was spreading among the  people. What do you say on this? What is your plan, if any, for  the revitalization of politics? In your opening remarks you  stressed the need for creative relations between the government  ruling party and the opposition party. You also urged the  opposition party to become a sincere partner for reforms. For  this end, do you think it necessary to hold talks between the  leaders of the ruling and opposition parties?    [President Kim] It has been one year since I was  inaugurated. However, I told you that this one year seems to be  10 years for me. I come to my office in Chongwadae between 0720  and 0740 every morning. That is when my work begins. My work  varies greatly. There are many, many things for which I as the  president should be responsible. This situation has made it  inevitable for me to directly and personally deal with  everything. However, I did these things according to my  conscience. As you know, right after my inauguration I declared  that I will never receive money, not even a coin, from anyone in  five years while staying in the presidency. I will keep this  promise. While staying in the presidency I will never be  involved in any concessions. My faith is that I should become a  clean and morally dignified president. By becoming so, I think,  I can dignifiedly ask and appeal to the people to do for the  country. This is why I have such faith.    I have mentioned many times the need for clean politics and  for the revitalization of politics. Spending money for politics  is a bad thing and should be done away with thoroughly. A  genuine democracy cannot be expected in those countries where  people spend money in politics. Only when clean elections are  conducted can genuine democracy be enforced. I would not point  out the name of a specific country which has been known to spend  much money in elections. Those countries which spend money in  politics are corrupt countries. This finally leads to  dictatorship. It also leads the people to ruin. So, politics  should be clean, and elections should be clean.    On the issue of our political party, the Democratic Liberal  Party, I have already handed all and absolute power over party  management affairs and other affairs regarding the National  Assembly within our party over to Kim Chong-pil, chairman of the  party. I have transferred all powers over to Chairman Kim  Chong-pil. I will not meddle in the management affairs of the  National Assembly. So, Chairman Kim Chong-pil has been operating  our party with all authority.    Speaking of the matter on meeting the representative of the  opposition party, I think we can meet any time, if necessary.    [Reporter Ed Paisley for FAR EASTERN ECONOMIC REVIEW in  English] I would like to ask you questions about the  government's privatization program. You have an ambitious  schedule of selling all state-owned companies. Will the  Federation of Korea Industries be involved in this process as  they are now in telecommunications industry privatization or  will the (?industries) be excluded from the process, leaving the  decision-making in the hands of some self-interested bureaucrats?    [President Kim] Our government will decide on the  privatization plan. I think the operation of state-run  enterprises in our country may have been loose or faulty in the  past. Therefore, I plan to actively push the privatization  program. You asked about the issue of the second mobile  telecommunications corporation. I see many Japanese reporters  here. For example in Japan, this issue was not handled by the  government but autonomously by the National Federation of  Japanese Business Corporations. Believing this method to be very  desirable, our government plans to remain detached from this  issue and to leave the decisionmaking in the hands of the  Federation of Korea Industries.    [Reporter Kim Chang-ki for CHOSON ILBO] In your opening  remarks earlier, you pointed out that political reform is most  urgent, and in fact, many people sympathize with this. Reform  of the system is also important to political reform. However,  many people emphasize that people must be replaced first of all.  Will you tell us of your plans, if any, to foster a new  political generation for political reform, as well as your plans  on the succession structure [hugye kudo]? The issue of  reorganizing political circles and of revising the Constitution  to institute a cabinet system has recently been raised among the  people. I would appreciate hearing your opinion on these issues.    [President Kim] You have asked several questions at once.  People are key to all work. Through lessons learnt from  history, we know that the history of a nation can change  according to who becomes the leader of that country. World  history shows that a nation's history changed according to who  its leader became. Therefore, the issue of the leadership of a  nation, which includes assemblymen, dominates all problems.  Because the previous era of dictatorship lasted so long in our  country, various improper customs and practices of the people  were propagated. Values have now changed. I hope that more  reform-oriented, progressive figures who can dedicate themselves  to the nation will come forward in political circles.    I was asked some time ago about the succession structure,  but  I am being asked again today. One year has passed since I came  to office, and four years, the length of a president's term in  office in the United States, still remains. If one were to  think about one's successor only one year into one's term with  four years remaining, that person would be considered strange  indeed. It is a little too early to bring this issue up. Allow  me plenty of time to think over this issue.    Currently I am not considering political realignment at  all. This is not a matter which can be solved artificially.  Also, I believe that the parliamentary government system is not  at all appropriate in our country's situation. If our country  carries out a responsible parliamentary system, it will only  result in misfortune in a situation in which our country is  already divided. I believe that this system is of absolutely no  value to us. I'll be frank with you. When I met Hosokawa in  Kyongju and at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation conference,  he said to me that he earnestly felt a president-centered system  to be favorable in politics.    [YONHAP reporter Kim Song-su] I would like to ask you two  questions regarding the election of chiefs of regional  autonomous bodies. The 1995 election of chiefs of regional  autonomous bodies can be regarded as an important election that  will prove the success or failure of political reform.  Nevertheless, there is already concern regarding elements of  corruption in regions on the issue of candidates. Do you have a  measure to deal with such corruption? Also, in connection with  the election of chiefs of regional autonomous bodies, is there a  more desirable way to restructure the administrative district  and regulate the government structure?    [President Kim] I think the most important aspect in the  election of chiefs of regional autonomous bodies is to carry out  clean elections. Only then can the chiefs of regional  autonomous bodies sincerely and honestly work for that region.  I will mobilize all of our administrative power to strictly  punish those carrying out illegal elections. I would like to  say that confidential inquiries are being made on rumors that  candidates are carrying out corrupt acts. The issue of  restructuring the administrative district is an issue to be  decided upon at the National Assembly. I hope that political  circles will deal with this matter in a just way and in  accordance with the people's interest.    [SEOUL SINMUN reporter Kim Yong-man] I would like to ask you  a question on the economy. As you noted, many people are  worried about price instability. The government's policy on  price control is moving from indirect regulation to direct  regulation. What is the government's policy on prices and can  this year's inflation be kept at six percent? What is your view  on this?    [President Kim] I talked about the price issue a short while  ago. The government regards the price issue as its most  important task. We are making utmost efforts. I mentioned that  the people's decisive cooperation is necessary. Related to  this, certain people are talking about the issue of carrying out  tax investigations. Tax investigations are carried out on  businesses that unjustly raise prices. Such tax investigations  are not illegal, and must be carried out. Also, public utility  charges of those that were inevitable were raised. We will  continue to work to control various matters that stimulate price  increases such as the rise in public utility charges. The rise  in public utility charges will be absorbed through  rationalization of management. The government will exert  efforts regarding this matter but we also need the people's  voluntary cooperation.    [SBS reporter Chon Yong-hak] You talked about measures for  price stability. You said that tax investigations will be  carried out on unjustly raised prices. However, measures that  are being taken resemble those of the past which contradict  overall economic liberalization. What is your view on this  matter? Late last year you said you would reduce land prices,  interest rates, and wages and work to revitalize the economy.  However, recent trends indicate that these prices are also on  the rise. What is the reason for this? Also, do you have any  measures for this?    [President Kim] I think that the issue of price stability is  of great interest. As I said before, I apologize to the people  once again regarding this matter. I had expressed a strong will  to be absolutely intolerant of unearned income [pullosotuk] and  increasing land prices. I believe that the three elements [land  prices, interest rates, and wages] were kept considerably under  control last year and expect that to be the case this year also.  I will take strict measures regarding this matter.    Also, workers have shown a tendency to restrain themselves  in demanding wage increases. We must cooperate at this  important time when we must improve the nation's competitive  edge. I have met numerous workers and talked with them over  lunch many times. I have visited many small- and medium-size  business corporations, though I have visited a few big ones, as  well. Officials in those small and medium-size corporations  have told me what difficulties they are facing. During my  recent regional tours, I have witnessed many changes that the  small- and medium-size corporations are undergoing.    I have always thought that small- and medium-size  corporations form the foundation of our economy. They play a  very important role in our economy. They employ over 50 percent  of our workers.    Some people say the government has been negligent in  assisting small- and medium-size corporations. This is not  correct. Last year, we completely froze the wages of government  officials. I am very sorry for the government officials and  their families. The government assisted small- and medium-size  corporations with 1.3 trillion won, a portion of the funds saved  by the wage freeze.    When the government heard that they were facing very serious  difficulties because of the implementation of the real-name  financial transaction system, it assisted them with another 2.2  trillion won. No other regime has given such a massive monetary  assistance to small- and medium-size corporations.    As a result, small- and medium-size corporations have become  very active, and many companies have declared that this year  will be the first year of labor-management harmony. I am very  pleased to see many companies where management and workers are  working in a family-like atmosphere.    [Steven Glenn of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL in English] Thank  you, Mr. President. I am Steven Glenn of THE WALL STREET  JOURNAL. You have made internationalization a prominent theme of  your administration in your speech this morning. As you know,  that means Korea will have to open its markets to foreign  competitors, goods, and services. That could create some  business failures here and rising employment. And, I am  wondering if you are willing to accept short-term sacrifices for  long-term benefits of internationalization. I would also like  to ask you if labor relations this year do not proceed as  smoothly as you would like, would you be willing to reform the  labor code?    [President Kim] Globalization and internationalization  constitute a trend that we cannot reserve. All countries of the  world are moving in this direction. And, I think this is a road  we must move along without fail. And, we are at an important  point at which we must win victory without fail on this road.    The point is: Even though our markets have been opened,  markets of other countries have opened even wider. Winning  through competition in these widely open markets is the only way  for us to survive. We must win in the competition by  manufacturing the best- quality goods in the world. Given our  people's potential and ability, I am confident we can win.  Having confidence is the most important thing. Being confident  in what we can do is the most important, I think. Having a  dream is also very important. I think we can win in worldwide  competition. I think both long-term and short-term prospects  are not grim.    As for labor-management relations, because both businessmen  and workers firmly believe they must win in this difficult era  of international competition, they declared this year would the  first year of labor-management harmony, while restraining  themselves, seeking common interests, and seeking national  interests. I hope labor-management relations will go smoothly  this year. I do not plan to reform the labor code for now.    [KUNGMIN ILBO reporter Kim Song-chin] Just now, you  mentioned internationalization. Therefore, I would like to ask  you about two matters regarding the Uruguay Round negotiations.  First, what measures will the government take against the  possible strong pressure by the advanced countries, including  the United States, to open the banking and service markets, in  addition to the agricultural field? Second, now the National  Assembly must ratify the Uruguay Round negotiations: How do you  persuade the opposition parties or farmers' organizations to  support it? If you have any plans, will you please tell us  about them?    [President Kim] You used the term pressure of opening. This  does not mean that we will give in to other countries' pressure.  We will decide on a policy to meet the interest of our nation.  I believe that we will never give in to pressure. It is  unthinkable. Our country's position is very firm. It is not the  position of our country to give in to pressure. We could not  but to decide, however, if we were to become an isolated state  or compete with other countries in the international arena.  During the Uruguay negotiations, we had to consider the  national interest. I hope you can understand it.    Furthermore, I have been to rural communities on many  occasions. I found that there were many changes in farmers'  position. They have greatly changed. Of course, farmers must  change on their own. It is an indispensable global trend to  adopt the so-called Uruguay Round negotiations. Therefore, we  must survive, at any cost, in the international arena by raising  competitiveness. In this respect, we must change our thought.  As mentioned earlier, we will provide support to rural  communities by establishing a special tax bill to save 1.5  trillion won per year. By forming the agricultural development  [nongbalwi] committee, the government will make every effort to  provide support to rural communities based on the idea that to  save the rural communities is to save the country. I believe  that our farmers have a considerable understanding of this and  have changed on their own everyday. In this respect, I think,  it is very fortunate.    [SANKEI SHIMBUM reporter Kuroda] Thank you. I have two  questions for you. You have strongly stressed  internationalization. However, there is an argument regarding  the introduction of the Japanese culture. What do you think of  it, upon your upcoming visit to Japan? First, do you think that  Japan must be excluded from the internationalization of your  country? Second, the ROK papers reported that North Korean  loggers escaped from a lumber camp in Russia, and that they have  asked the ROK Government for asylum. However, your government  refused it. What do you think of it?    [President Kim] Thank you. In moving forward the  internationalization, as I mentioned earlier, it is our position  that we will open all markets. There may be problems in opening  the markets. I believe that it is right to open the market.  However, we must carefully consider the method and time of the  opening. As you talked about my upcoming visit to Japan, I will  visit Japan and China next month. Of course, needless to say  that our relations with the United States are very important,  but, at the same time, our relations with the three countries,  such as Japan, China, and Russia -- which are neighboring  countries -- are very important as well. I believe that it is  very significant for me to visit the two countries, Japan and  China. Not only for the common interest between the ROK and the  two countries, but also for the settlement of the nuclear issue,  economic cooperation with them, and the cooperation between  their people -- in particular, Japan and China are members of  the APEC [Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation] -- my upcoming  visit to the two countries is very significant.    Regarding your last question on the North Korean workers'  request for asylum, I have received the detailed reports. As of  present, a great number of people are engaged in lumber cutting  work in Russia. It is true that North Korea have sent many  people there. Many of them have visited our country's embassy  or consulate in Russia and asked for asylum. The number of  people who asked for asylum is tremendous. However, the  majority of them do not have passports. In order words, they are  stateless. This is strange. We may think that they are Koreans  because they speak the Korean language. It is very easy and  simple for us to accept their asylum if they ask for it directly  from North Korea. In this case, we can easily decide on it.  Because they have asked for asylum from other country's  territory, the so-called Russia, there are many international  problems. Therefore, we must consider those international issues  in the light of international law. However, we are basically  carefully and positively dealing with them in the light of  humaneness and human rights.    [Kim Ki-ung from HANGUK KYONGJE SINMUN] Mr. President,  since being sworn in, you have paid particular attention to  economic affairs. Every time such serious problems as the  opening of the rice markets, the shortages of the social  overhead capital, and the contamination of portable water arose,  you said solving those problems would be the top priorities in  state affairs. Some people wonder whether these problems can be  solved at a time no budget is appropriated for solving those  problems. Would you comment on this? Also, many people point  out some government ministries announce new policies without  coordinating views with other pertinent ministries. Would you  comment on this, as well?    [President Kim] Each project is being carried out depending  on its priority. We have established a special tax for solving  the rice problem. We have also proposed a bill on inducing  private capital. As for the social overhead capital, we will  decide on which infrastructural problem should be solved first  and which should be later. The water problem and the  agricultural problem must be solved on a priority basis. I  again say people will help the government solve these problems.    [Yun Chang-chung of SEGYE ILBO] I will ask you a question on  your philosophy on operating the national economy. In the early  days of your presidency, you repeatedly stressed the spirit of  sharing pains. However, you have recently given us the  impression that you attach importance to big businesses. What  is your genuine philosophy on operating the national economy?  Seeing the economy not improving, some people say the efforts  to share pains have reached their limit. They also criticize  the government for not presenting concrete goals, for example,  the goal of national economic growth. Would you comment on this?    [President Kim] I think I have answered a similar question.  I have stated I attach importance to small- and medium-size  corporations. I have also stated how much the government  assisted them. My government has attached the greatest  importance to small- and medium-size corporations. I have met  more workers than any other president. I have had lunch with  them and talked with them wherever I have gone. I think you  cannot stress too much the importance of small- and medium-size  corporations. I hope you understand this.    Why do we not have goals? We are going toward the set goals.  The goal of economic growth for this year is 6 percent. The  notion that there is no philosophy on operating the national  economy is not correct. We will make every effort to fulfill  those set goals.    [Andrew Steele of REUTER, in English] Mr. President: We  have heard many times now the government's plans for  liberalizing the economic markets. But, recent events have  shown that the government has, in fact, been intervening heavily  in the economy. I mention two factors here: price controls and  the recent measures to cool the stock exchange, which has, in  fact, infuriated a lot of foreign investors who are barred even  further from getting into the Korean markets. Why is the  government saying one thing about liberalization when, in fact,  it continues to intervene heavily. Thank you?    [President Kim] As for the market opening, we are planning  to  open everything to ensure that foreigners think Korea is the  best place to do business. I think providing conditions to  ensure that foreigners invest in Korea without anxiety is very  important.    The government facilitates utmost autonomy in all sectors. I  think the notion that the government heavily intervenes in  everything is a misunderstanding.    Some people tend to suspect that if anything happens, the  government must have done something. Those days have passed. I  hope there is no misunderstanding on this matter.    [Shinogawa of MAINICHI SHIMBUN] During your news  conference held at the beginning of this year, you said signs of  peace were visible in North Korea. What has happened to those  signs of peace? And, what do you mean by signs of peace?    [President Kim] Though I have much information on this, I  think it is not good to tell you about it here. As you know,  changes are taking place in North Korea, are they not? North  Korea, which had stated it would never receive inspections from  the IAEA, notified the IAEA and the United States that it would  receive inspections from the IAEA and issue visas in a few days.  This was unimaginable last year. I once said North Korea would  change. I think this [acceptance of nuclear inspection] in  itself is a great change.    [Han Myon-taek of the Christian Broadcasting System] My  question concerns educational reform. The Education Ministry  and the Educational Reform Committee will map out reform plans.  What is your basic plan on the high school and college entrance  examination systems, foreign language education, and other  matters?    [President Kim] I think education is the most important in  our society. I know the quality of education determines the  destiny of a country. I realized this upon reading a book  written by Paul Kennedy. Someone says Korea owes its current  prosperity to education.    There are daunting problems in education not only in Korea  but also in the advanced countries in the world. We have  reporters here from Japan and the United States. The United  States has very difficult problems in education. Japan is no  different.    Because educational reform is very important, it took almost  one year to form the Education Reform Committee. Education is  not a matter on which decisions can be made quickly. It takes  much time to decide on educational reform. I think we must  examine various factors to map out far-reaching plans. I have  my own ideas. I will fully discuss this matter with the newly  established Educational Reform Committee and the education  minister. We will make decisions on how to reform education to  ensure that our country survives.    [Unidentified reporter] You will soon visit China.  Telephone exchange systems, automobiles, and aviation are  matters of concern between the two countries. Would you tell us  if it is possible to reach any agreement on these matters?  People say the Chinese leader should visit our country this  time because President No Tae-u visited China the last time.  What do you think of this?    [President Kim] I and the Chinese leader met during the APEC  summit talks and discussed telephone exchange systems and  aviation. It is not correct to mention these issues now. As for  protocol, I think you should know which leader should visit the  other is not that important of a matter. Since the two countries  established diplomatic relations, the Chinese head of state had  never sent a letter, for example, a letter of invitation, to the  ROK. This time, China sent an official letter of invitation for  me to visit China. China invited me to visit China as a state  guest. During a news conference held early this year, I told  people that I would go anywhere in the world as a salesman if it  is beneficial to our state and people. I will go anywhere if it  is beneficial to our country.    As I told you before, now is a very important time, I think.  Therefore, visiting Japan and China in the era of the Pacific  basin is very significant. Thank you.</p>

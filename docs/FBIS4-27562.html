			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 30 KYODO -- Japan's six major electric  machinery makers plan to spend 15.4 percent more on business  investment for semiconductor production in fiscal 1994 than they  did the previous year, according to their projections.    The six concerns -- Hitachi Ltd., Fujitsu Ltd., NEC Corp.,  Toshiba Corp., Mitsubishi Electric Corp. and Oki Electric  Industry Co. -- set aside a total of 461 billion yen for  investment for the fiscal year that ends March 31, 1995, up from  399.6 billion yen the year before.    Industry officials cited an unabated personal computer boom  in the United States and bright prospects for domestic demand as  factors behind the bullish spending plans.    The bulk of these investment is targeted at memory chips,  for  which demand is shifting from 4-megabit dynamic random access  memory (dram) chips to 16-megabit dram chips.    "The shift in demand for 16-megabit dram chips will be put  into top gear" in the latter half of this year, said Hajime  Sasaki, managing director at NEC.    NEC, now an industry leader in 16-megabit dram chips,  expects  to raise manufacturing capacity to 3 million units a month by  next March from the current one million.    Hitachi is trying to catch up with NEC in the 16-megabit  dram  chip market with a project to raise monthly capacity at one of  its main domestic chip factories to 3 million units, also by  next March.    Fujitsu's investment plan calls for investing more than 100  billion yen, its first such layout in three years, while Toshiba  and Mitsubishi plan to increase investment for the first time in  three years after keeping their investments flat for the past  two years.    Oki, which returned to profitability in the latest business  year ended March 31, expects to double its investment for chip  production.</p>

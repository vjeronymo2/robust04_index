			<p><P> August 9, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CHEST PAINS PUT BRONCOS' COACH REEVES IN HOSPITAL  </P> <P> Denver Broncos Coach Dan Reeves has been hospitalized after he suffered chest  pains Wednesday night, his daughter said today.  </P> <P> The name of the hospital to which Reeves was admitted was not known. Denver  Broncos officials declined to reveal Reeves' location.  </P> <P> Reeves is in good condition, Laura Reeves said. Her father was initially taken  to North Colorado Medical Center in Greeley when the problem occurred about 6  p.m. Wednesday. She said the family believes Reeves can receive better care in  California.  </P> <P> At a hastily called news conference at the Broncos training camp here, Dr.  Randall Marsh confirmed that Reeves had suffered chest pains, but not a heart  attack.  </P> <P> "This morning, he is just fine. We have discovered blockages in arteries  supplying blood to the heart," Marsh, a cardiologist at North Colorado Medical  Center, said.  </P> <P> The medical term for Reeves' ailment is atherosclerosis, a form of  arteriosclerosis, said Garrett Mudd, a Broncos spokesman.  </P> <P> Reeves is expected to remain hospitalized for four to five days, and has been  advised to take three to four weeks off, Marsh said. Reeves will have the  problem treated immediately, with the focus on avoiding surgery.  </P> <P> The cardiologist said that he does not expect the problem to harm Reeves'  career and that there will be no restrictions when he returns to work.  </P> <P> "I'm not worried about him," the doctor said. "He has had a rude awakening by  Mother Nature."  </P> <P> Chicago Bears Coach Mike Ditka, a longtime friend of Reeves who suffered a  heart attack in November, 1988, said Reeves had all the symptoms of a heart  attack, "but he was smart enough -- which I wasn't when I had mine -- to  recognize what was going on."  </P> <P> During Reeves' absence, defensive coordinator Wade Phillips has been named  interim coach, Mudd said.  </P> <P> Reeves, 46, took over the Broncos in 1981 and is in his 10th season with the  team. He has led the team to three Super Bowl seasons in the past four years.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Strasbourg, April 14 (AFP) - Russian  ultra-nationalist leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy left for home on  Thursday [14 April] complaining European parliamentarians had  stolen his cap.    The navy blue seaman's cap, Zhirinovskiy's trademark,  disappeared Wednesday night at a reception in the Council of  Europe restaurant in honour of the assembly's new secretary  general, Sweden's Daniel Tarschys.    In a communique, the Russian MP denounced "the moral level  of  European parliamentarians," but advised the thief to wait before  selling the cap.    "The stock exchange quotation of my headgear will increase  considerably in the near future," the communique said.    Zhirinovskiy also renewed his attacks against France "where  there is no democracy," and against the Council of Europe,  saying he would do his utmost to prevent the admission of Russia.    The Russian MP criticised the French for giving him a  restricted visa limited to the city of Strasbourg and to the  duration of the council's parliamentary spring session, and said  he had no intention of coming back.

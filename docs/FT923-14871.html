			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / First steps of the housing recovery falter: An end to the sales slump is as far away as ever BRITAIN'S deeply depressed housing market looks as far from recovery as ever. Sales, which had shown promise of picking up earlier in the year, have faltered in the past six weeks according to housebuilders. Tarmac, Britain's biggest housebuilder, says: 'Sales in May and April were very poor.' Mr Tony Pidgley, managing director of Berkeley Group, says that conditions in the housing market are now slightly worse than a year ago. The group has managed to boost its profits by taking advantage of cheaper land which, in parts of southern England, has more than halved in price since the peak in the housing market in 1988. Other housebuilders, which raised borrowings to buy expensive land at the end of the 1980s, have been hit as badly as the people who bought the homes. Sales - and prices of property and land - have fallen sharply. Mr Robert Sellier, chief executive of loss-making YJ Lovell, which earlier this year was forced to renegotiate its financing arrangements with banks, estimates that house prices have fallen by a further 5 per cent since September. The failure of the market to respond to lower prices and mortgage interest rates means that, nearly four years after the market peaked, families are struggling to sell homes which in southern England are worth on average a quarter less than the prices paid for them in 1988. It is not unrealistic to suggest that some people may have to wait until the next century before getting their money back in nominal terms. In real terms, after adjusting for inflation, they may never recover their losses. Concern over the plight of the housing market has prompted some Conservative MPs to sign a Commons motion calling on the government to extend its eight-month 'holiday' on stamp duty which is due to end next month. Housebuilders, while throwing their weight behind the move, fear it will do little to lift the market out of its slough. One depressed executive says: 'Lets face it, sales should be picking up by now if stamp duty was really making any difference.' Prospects for a recovery getting under way this summer are diminishing. April, May and June, before the school summer holidays start, are usually big months for house sales. With the holidays almost upon us indications are that purchases may be even lower than during the corresponding months last year. According to the Inland Revenue, the number of house transactions in England and Wales during the first five months of this year fell by more than 20 per cent against the first five months of last year - which included the Gulf war. A better guide to current trends are building society figures showing that net new commitments over the same two periods fell by more than 14 per cent. Building societies usually give a commitment to lend money about 10 weeks before the loan is made and the sale concluded. Falls of 21 per cent in net commitments in April and 26 per cent in May, compared with the same two months last year, bode ill for summer house sales. Meanwhile prices are still falling according to Nationwide Building Society, which said they declined on average by a further 0.5 per cent last month. Housebuilders, which have been offering substantial discounts and sales incentives, fear that any increase in prices is unlikely to arise before the end of next year because sales need to climb substantially before any recovery in prices can begin. Assuming that prices after next year rise at an average annual rate of 5 per cent - which seems reasonable given growth restraints likely from UK membership of the ERM - it would not be until the year 2000 that average prices in south-east England returned to their 1988-89 peak. For families who bought homes in East Anglia, where prices have fallen by an average of 30 per cent since the beginning of 1989, the wait could be even longer. Some of these people, who took out 100 per cent mortgages, will be trapped in homes which will be worth less than money borrowed to buy them. Such fears only undermine confidence further. Halifax, the country's largest mortgage lender, says that the biggest single factor holding back a recovery is concern over rising unemployment and the state of the economy. It hopes there will be some recovery in sales in the second half of this year leading to a gentle rise in prices next year - but those hopes must now be receding. THE NUMBER of housebuilding starts fell 4.6 per cent in May compared with the same month last year, the Department of the Environment announced yesterday. According to provisional figures, 14,400 dwellings were started against 15,100 in May 1991. Completions numbered 11,800 compared with 14,500. In the three months to the end of May, 43,200 dwellings were started, a fall of 1 per cent on the same period last year. Completions were down 9 per cent at 39,100. The seasonally adjusted figures show that in the three months to the end of May total starts were down 2 per cent compared with the previous three months, while total completions were down 1 per cent. Private enterprise starts were down 7 per cent and completions were down 4 per cent. Letters, Page 7</p>

			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / International Capital Markets: Mexico opened to N American financial groups US and Canadian-based financial institutions will be allowed to open subsidiaries in Mexico from the second half of this year, according to regulations that came into effect yesterday. The Mexican finance ministry will accept applications from banks, brokerages, insurance and other financial institutions until July 31 this year. The ministry will evaluate applications on that date, and give authorisations soon after. Non-US and Canadian institutions will be able to apply through their subsidiaries in North America. Foreign banks will collectively be limited to 8 per cent of total Mexican banking capital this year. If the limit is not reached, the ministry will invite a second round of foreign banks to apply for licenses. The capital limit for foreign banks is set under the North American Free Trade Agreement, and will grow to 15 per cent in 1999, after which it will be scrapped. An individual bank's capital will be limited to 1.5 per cent of the total. Foreign brokerages will initially be limited to 10 per cent of the Mexican market, with the share rising in equal increments to 20 per cent by 1999, and to 30 per cent over the following four years. Foreign insurance companies that already have interests in Mexico will be able to fully-own Mexican insurance companies after 1996; others have to wait until 2000. The ministry said foreign institutions would have to satisfy requirements similar to those demanded of Mexican entities operating abroad.</p>

			<p>930802 FT  02 AUG 93 / London dealers in vigil as Far East markets open FOREIGN exchange dealers in London were preparing last night for an unusual out-of-hours trading session as they waited for European Community finance ministers to decide on the future of the exchange rate mechanism. London currency dealers were poised to make prices in Asian trading time. Such trading is usually limited to the night of a UK general election or a US presidential poll. The meeting in Brussels is expected to have a powerful effect on today's trading in currencies, bonds and equities. The overwhelming view in the London market was that the selling of the French franc would only stop this week if France announced substantial cuts in interest rates. 'People have been selling the franc because they believe that France's interest rates are too high,' said Mr Paul Chertkow, global currency strategist at Union Bank of Switzerland in London. 'The selling will only stop if France reduces them to 4 per cent by the end of the year.' The French intervention rate stood yesterday at 6.75 per cent. A broad cut in rates, including the German discount rate, would trigger a rally on European bond markets, not only in France, but also in Belgium and Italy, which would benefit from the reduction in borrowing costs to fund their deficits. Some dealers believed that the continuing crisis in the ERM could be staved off for a few weeks if there was a realignment, or a widening of the French franc's fluctuation band against the D-Mark. But few believed that this would be a long-term solution, even if it was accompanied by modest cuts in German and French interest rates. Some dealers thought a suspension of the system was the most likely outcome, allowing Europe to cut short-term interest rates, and letting Europe's currencies float for the first time in 14 years. But dealers were uncertain whether the market would buy or sell a freely floating franc. dealers believed the franc would depreciate against the D-Mark in the short term as France cuts interest rates. But others thought the franc could appreciate above the FFr3.40 level against the D-Mark because of France's strong trade and current account position. Mr Eric Fishwick, an analyst at IBJ International in London, said that the end of the ERM could trigger the start of a long-term move out of the D-Mark into other European currencies and the dollar. 'Take the system away, and you are left looking at Germany's fundamental economic weakness,' he said.</p>

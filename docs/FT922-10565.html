			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / EC urged to offer free trade to Maghreb countries THE EC has been urged to offer the Maghreb countries of North Africa free trade and an intensified political dialogue as a means of encouraging stability and limiting migration across the Mediterranean. The European Commission yesterday approved a policy document containing such proposals for presentation to EC foreign ministers in mid-May. Brussels hopes that such 'a new Euro-Maghreb partnership' will balance, to some extent, the Community's fast-growing ties with its northern and eastern neighbours. The Commission is already holding exploratory talks on Moroccan free trade proposal, and is ready to do the same with Tunisia. The other potential beneficiary is Algeria, though rapid rapprochement is unlikely after the Algiers government's move this year to stem Islamic fundamentalism by suspending elections. The two other Maghreb countries are considered excluded from the Commission's initiative - Libya, because it is the target of EC and United Nations sanctions over airline terrorism, and Mauritania, because it gets separate EC benefits through the Lome convention. Maghreb countries already stand to gain from the EC's Mediterranean programme of Ecu4.4bn (Pounds 3.13bn) in grants and loans for 1992-96. Disturbed by human rights abuses in Morocco, European MPs are currently blocking money for Morocco, as well as Syria. Francis Ghiles adds from Washington: A Dollars 275m (Pounds 155m) structural adjustment loan to Morocco is due to be approved today by the board of the World Bank. The loan is part of a co-financing package to which the African Development Bank will contribute a further Dollars 100m. It is the seventh World Bank loan to support restructuring and liberalisation of Morocco's economy after the foreign debt was rescheduled in September 1983.</p>

			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Reed lower Anglo-Dutch publishing group Reed Elsevier was unfortunate in the timing of its announcement that it had made a Pounds 955m acquisition in the US and the fall in the share price masked a mixed but generally favourable reception. Analysts said the company had had to pay a hefty price for the on-line legal information service it bought from Mead Corp but the cost would be offset by sizeable tax savings. Ms Chris Munro of Hoare Govett argued that the group had gained access to a market that was growing by 9 per cent a year. But one analyst commented: 'The deal poses as many strategic questions as it answers and they will need to do a lot of work to make it all add up.' The stock closed 15 off at 740p.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By RENMIN RIBAO reporter Xu Rujun (1776 1172 0193), and </F> XINHUA reporter Liu Siyang (0491 1835 2254)]    [Text] Beijing, 21 Jan (XINHUA) -- The national conference  on the education of party members -- which opened in Beijing  today -- stated that, while developing the socialist market  economy, earnest efforts must be made to intensify and improve  the education of party members so that, with higher qualities in  various fields, they will fight to achieve the new historical  missions.    The conference is sponsored by the Organization Department  and the Propaganda Department of the CPC Central Committee.    It has been reported that the education of party members has  constantly been intensified since the Third Plenary Session of  the 11th CPC Central Committee. In recent years, in light of  the central committee's plan and requirements, the vast number  of party members have been systematically educated on the "three  basics" -- the basic theories of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong  Thought, the party's basic line, and basic party knowledge -- as  well as on the current situation and policies, party conduct and  party discipline, the theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics, and guidelines laid down by the 14th National  Party Congress. As a result of the educational courses, party  members, with higher political awareness, have given full scope  to their roles as vanguards and role models, and party  organizations have continued to demonstrate their roles as  fighting fortresses. The educational courses for party members  have powerfully quickened and promoted the development of  reform, opening up, and socialist modernization.    To keep pace with the new situation, the current conference  on the education of party members stated that the general  requirement for party members' education under the new  conditions is to firmly adhere to the guidance provided by Deng  Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics and the party's basic line; focus on economic  construction; improve the quality of party members in all  fields; amplify the militancy of party organizations; and  mobilize all party members to work hard to build a socialist  market economic system, achieve the second-step strategic  objectives, and carry out all strategic missions put forth by  the 14th National Party Congress.    Liu Yunshan [0491 0061 1472], deputy head of the Central  Propaganda Department, said at the conference that education for  party members today and in the future should give priority to  three things: First, it should complete the assignment to arm  the whole party with Deng Xiaoping's theory of building  socialism with Chinese characteristics. Party committees at all  levels must earnestly implement the central committee's decision  of studying Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng  Xiaoping, and continue to organize the vast number of party  members to study Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng  Xiaoping until results have been achieved. While making  sure that grass-roots party members will properly study the  book, special attention should be paid to study among party  member-cadres, especially party member-leading cadres. Second,  it should persist in educating party members on party spirit.  Party members must be educated to merge communist ideals with  the ideals shared by people throughout the country at the  present stage, and to rally and guide the vast number of people  to work hard together to expedite reform and construction; to  merge the objective of serving the people wholeheartedly with  the work of developing the socialist market economy; to  cultivate lofty moral sentiments by fostering communist ethics  as well as social and professional ethics; and to preserve and  carry forward the party's fine traditions through strictly  abiding by the party's disciplinary rules while embarking on  exploring new fields, bringing forth new ideas, opening up to  outside world, and enlivening the economy. Leading cadres must  set personal examples in order to make education on party spirit  a success. Third, it should educate party members on basic  knowledge of the socialist market economy, modern science, and  modern general knowledge. This educational project is an urgent  assignment which must be properly accomplished.    In conclusion, Liu Yunshan said: There are now extremely  good opportunities for educating party members. It is to be  hoped that all party committees and departments in charge of  party members' education will earnestly strengthen their  leadership over party members' education, have a firm grip of  the project, place it high on their agendas, and accomplish it  firmly and meticulously so that a new situation in party  members' education can be created with a new approach.    Zhao Zongnai, deputy head of the Central Organization  Department, chaired today's meeting. Present at the meeting  were Lu Feng, Zhang Quanjing, Fu Jie and other comrades in  charge of relevant central departments; and persons in charge of  organization and propaganda departments and discipline  inspection commissions of party committees of provinces,  autonomous regions, municipalities directly under the central  government's jurisdiction, and some cities.</p>

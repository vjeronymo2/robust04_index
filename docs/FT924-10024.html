			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / MI5 told of plan for Iraqi gun 'in 1988' BRITISH security was first told in May 1988 that Iraq was planning to build a gun capable of firing large shells, it was claimed at the Old Bailey yesterday. Mr Mark Gutteridge, an employee of Matrix Churchill, the machine tool manufacturer, told MI5 then about Iraqi plans to co-operate with SRC, the company run by the late Mr Gerald Bull, to build a 210mm shell, Mr Geoffrey Robertson QC told the court. 'This was the first inkling of the supergun, ' he said. An MI5 officer, giving evidence anonymously, said Mr Gutteridge, his contact, had talked to him about SRC but he could not now remember details of the conversation. Their relationship was typical of those between MI5 and businessmen, he said  -a fine balance of asking for help for the best of reasons and the possible commercial consequences. Three former Matrix Churchill directors, Mr Paul Henderson, Mr Trevor Abraham and Mr Peter Allen, all deny breaching export regulations by pretending that machine tools exported to Iraq were for civil, not military, use. The trial continues today.</p>

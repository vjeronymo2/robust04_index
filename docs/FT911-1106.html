			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / Heartburn in US over vice-president THE WORRIES at the weekend over President George Bush's heartbeat, now regular again, have turned into an intense debate, dominating television programmes and newspapers, over the qualifications of Vice-President Dan Quayle. The revival of the Quayle question has been underlined by two new opinion polls indicating that most people in the US believe he should be dropped from the Republican ticket for the presidential election next year. According to a Washington Post/ABC News poll, 57 per cent believe he is not qualified to become president and 54 per cent think Mr Bush should put someone else on the ticket next year. A narrow majority, however, believes he is qualified to be vice-president. A USA Today poll shows 46 per cent thinking Mr Quayle is not qualified to be president and 51 per cent arguing that he should be dropped next year. The official White House line has been that Mr Quayle will remain on the ticket next year. In face of critical media comment, senior administration officials rallied round to defend the vice-president, praising his contribution to decisions. During his foreign visits, Mr Quayle has assiduously promoted US exports and contracts, and he is said to play a more active role in internal White House discussions than Mr Bush did when he was vice-president (1981-89). Mr Quayle is generally seen as speaking in favour of the conservative side of any case.</p>

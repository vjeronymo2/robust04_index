			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / Money Markets: Clarke stimulates bears STERLING money market dealers yesterday contradicted the views of their colleagues in currency markets, taking the view that another near-term cut in UK base rates was less likely after Mr Kenneth Clarke was appointed as the UK's new chancellor, writes James Blitz. As news filtered out yesterday morning that Mr John Major was planning to reshuffle his cabinet, dealers in sterling futures bid the near-term contracts up to new highs. A strong view in the market is that the Major government has sought an escape from its political difficulties by cutting base rates in an attempt to stimulate the economy. As news emerged that a reshuffle of the cabinet was imminent, the June short sterling contract rose 4 basis points to 94.09 and the September contract gained another 5 basis points to 94.25. After the announcement of Mr Clarke's appointment, the market retraced sharply. In part, this may have been due to the 'buy on the rumour and sell on the facts' principle. But several dealers accepted that a new chancellor would be unlikely to reduce base rates at a time when he needed to establish credibility with foreign exchange markets. The June contract finished at 94.04, down 1 basis point on the day, and the September contract closed 6 basis points lower at 94.14. At this level, dealers are still contemplating the idea that base rates could go down. Sterling cash rates were mostly unchanged on the news. Three-month money ended unchanged at 5 29/32 per cent. The overnight rate of lending dropped to about 4 per cent on the back of a shortage of Pounds 800m which was easily despatched. In Europe, yesterday's strong performance by the D-Mark gave a lift to Euromark futures and upset the recent trend of bullish thinking about French franc interest rates coming down. The D-Mark's strength was mostly the product of intense selling of the Spanish peseta. But the German currency's rise of nearly a centime against the French franc raised speculation that France might not be able to continue pushing official rates below German ones with the same esprit. The September Pibor contract, therefore, fell 14 basis points on the day to a close of around 93.18. Three-month French francs rose from 7.37 per cent to 7.43 per cent.</p>

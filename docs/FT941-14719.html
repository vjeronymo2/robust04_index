			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / People: Private Finance Working Group Brian Pearse, who steps down as chief executive of Midland Bank next March, and Malcolm Bates, deputy managing director of GEC, have joined the government-sponsored Private Finance Working Group which was set up at the end of last year. The addition of the two new names to a body whose aim is to coax private sector investment into public sector projects will help calm initial fears that the body would be dominated by civil servants. Eurotunnel's Sir Alastair Morton, who chairs the new group, has also decided not to invite any financial advisers from the City to sit on the group. He says he did not want to inhibit the flow of views from as wide a variety of City sources as possible. Apart from Sir Alastair, Pearse and Bates, the other members of the group are: Howard Davies, CBI director general; Allan Gormly, chief executive Trafalgar House; Pen Kent, associate director Bank of England; Sheila Masters, partner KPMG Peat Marwick; Neville Simms, chief executive Tarmac; Bob Dobbie, head of the Department of Trade and Industry's industrial competitiveness division; Gordon Greenshields, director of finance NHS management executive; Peter Mackay, secretary Scottish Office industry department; Steve Robson, deputy secretary (industry) HM Treasury; David Rowlands, principal finance officer Department of Transport, and Eugene Turton, deputy secretary (housing and urban) Department of the Environment.</p>

			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / Access to Cyprus sought for SFO THE GOVERNMENT is negotiating with the authorities in northern Cyprus in an attempt to win access to the island for the Serious Fraud Office regarding its investigation of Mr Asil Nadir, the fugitive businessman and former head of Polly Peck International. It hopes the SFO will be able to gain informal access to information and individuals in the region. Formal diplomatic requests for co-operation with the authorities have failed. The discussions form continued pressure by the British authorities on the self-proclaimed Turkish republic of northern Cyprus, under the threat of trade or other sanctions. Ms Lorna Harris, the SFO lawyer handling the Nadir case, last night returned to London after three days of what the British Embassy in Ankara called 'constructive discussions' relating to Mr Nadir's abscondment. She met a range of government officials including those in the Ministry of Justice. Mr Colin Jennings, British deputy high commissioner for Cyprus, confirmed yesterday that he had met Mr Rauf Denktash, the president of northern Cyprus, and Mr Dervish Eroglu, the prime minister, on Monday. He said British High Commission representatives had met officials in northern Cyprus about six times since Mr Nadir jumped bail last month. The renewed pressure comes in advance of a preparatory hearing in the High Court to consider the case on June 15.</p>

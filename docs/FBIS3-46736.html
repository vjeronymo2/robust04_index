The Russian Far East is made up of seven administrative  units, such as the Maritime Kray, the Sakhalin Oblast,  Khabarovsk Kray, and the Sakha Republic.    In this region are such resources as rich timber (30 percent  of the total for the former Soviet Union), aquatic products (40  percent), diamonds (98 percent), gold (50 percent), and tin (80  percent).    In terms of industrial structure, lumbering, nonferrous  metals, and fisheries make up 50 percent of the extractive and  manufacturing industries. Its secondary industries lag markedly,  with 80 percent of consumer goods and 50 percent of the food  brought in from other areas.    Efforts were made to develop defense industries in the  1930's; and the city of Komsomolsk-na-Amure became a center for  steel, petroleum refining, shipbuilding and aircraft industries.  Vladivostok provided supplies and repair as a base for the  Pacific Fleet.  <H5>  Far Eastern Area in Era of Reform </H5>   In a speech in Vladivostok in July 1986, Secretary General  Gorbachev stressed that economic development of the Far Eastern  region was inseparable from the strengthening of economic  cooperation and trade relations with Asian nations.    Keenly sensing that if carrying out the "Program for Far  East  Regional Development by 2000" (August 1987) were to end in  failure each region, would require economic self-reliance,  Nakhodka, Sakhalin, and Vladivostok applied to the union in  1988-91 for conversion into free-economy zones. The Yakutia,  Kamchatka, Sakhalin, and Maritime regions are proclaiming  sovereignty over management and utilization of resources within  their areas. Also, in August 1990 they set up a Far East  Economic Association, taking up such matters common to each  state as energy, foodstuffs, construction, transportation, and  military-to-civilian conversion, and they plan to pull together.  One of this association's achievements was drawing up the May  1991 "Concept for Solving the Far East Region's Crisis and  Economic Development by 2000"; but due to the coup of August  1991 and the breakup of the Soviet Union in December that year,  they did not get so far as to draw up an action program.    After that, based on a September 1992 presidential decree,  they deliberated on the "Far East development program" in light  of Russian and Far East conditions; and there are moves to try  to draw up the policies.  <H5>  Economic Cooperation in the Far East </H5>   What actions might be needed for now to bring about further  development of economic cooperation?    1. Expansion of Trade Deals    With trade between Japan and Russia totaling $3.48 billion  in  1992, it has fallen to 57 percent of its peak. Likewise, imports  also were down 26 percent to $2.5 billion; but a majority of  that was foodstuffs, lumber, coal, etc., for which the Far East  is a producing area. Hence, the Russian Far East is unchanged in  being a supplier of raw materials. As disruptions in the  economic system are causing the import reductions, considerable  recovery of trade volume is possible by bringing about quality  guarantees and strict observance of delivery dates  (normalization of rail transport and port operations).    2. Effective Use of G-7 Economic Aid    Aid totaling $43.4 billion was set for 1993; but it is  necessary to place all possible emphasis on the Far East for the  portion that is bilateral aid, to quickly set up also the Far  East region's receiving facilities and to put into effect an aid  program for shifting to a market economy.    3. Assistance for Preparing Infrastructure    With the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russia lost 60  percent  of the port facilities, making the bolstering of its Far East  harbors an urgent task. Also called for are double-tracking of  Amur River bridges which are a bottleneck to Siberian rail  transport, electrification of some rail lines, and adding to and  rebuilding power generation facilities so as to improve the  energy balance. Since these items will be the basis for future  development of the Far East, is not the time upon us when we  must consider the methods for cooperation between Japan and  Russia?    4. Resource Development Projects    "Siberian development" in the 1970's gave birth to an era of  Japan-Soviet cooperation centering on coal, lumber, and harbors;  and pushed Japan-Soviet trade up sixfold over a 10-year period.  Areas for cooperation henceforth may center on energy,  especially oil and gas. For the present, it is important to  continue the forestry development and Sakhalin continental shelf  gas and oil exploitation projects that are ongoing and to get  them on track.    Also, the Republic of Korea is considering development of  Yakutia gas by tieing up with the Sakha Republic, and it has  particulars from joint Japan-U.S.-Soviet investigations  conducted in the 1970's. Furthermore, since Yakutia gas also is  positioned to be a major source in Russia's own Far East energy  development plan (the Vostok plan), the chances are high of its  becoming a project for multinational cooperation.    For other subsurface resources as well, the exploitation of  such metals as gold, tin, and lead, construction of iron mills  due to development of Aldan iron ore and copper smelters due to  development of the Udokan copper mines (Chita region), etc., may  become objects for study as future projects.  <H5>  Pressing To Improve Japan-Russia relations </H5>   As discussed above, there are any number of subject areas  for  economic cooperation in Russia's Far East. The premises for that  are Russia's political and economic stabilization and clarifying  the authority of the center and local regions; but resolution of  the territories problem--a longstanding issue between Japan and  Russia, establishing neighborly relations by concluding a peace  treaty and resolving these by organically linking them with  economic cooperation are to be hoped for.    The cold war structure having collapsed, a situation has  emerged in which Japan, as one of the G-7 nations, will take on  a major role in aiding Russia. Russia's Far East has made  requests to the center for assistance; but those have not been  met. There has never been a time like the present when "new  thinking" has been so required of both Japan and Russia.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Damascus, May 6 KYODO -- Syria's Foreign Minister  Faruq al-Shar' told Japanese Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa on  Friday [6 May] that Syria is negative about joining multilateral  peace talks in the Middle East peace process at the present  stage.    In a 105-minute meeting with al-Shar', Kakizawa urged Syria  to join the multilateral talks, Japanese officials said.  Al-Shar', however, told Kakizawa that Syria will be pleased to  join the talks if peace is achieved. But the talks will be  vulnerable if peace is not achieved, al-Shar' was quoted as  saying. Al-Shar' hinted at Damascus' position to demand a  complete return of the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights.    The Syrian foreign minister also argued that Mideast  problems  must be settled in line with UN Security Council resolutions  that stipulate the inviolability of territories for all Mideast  countries, the officials said. Al-Shar' offered his "personal  support" for Japan's bid to obtain a permanent seat in the UN  Security Council, saying that he will recommend the Syrian  government to show support.    Kakizawa flew to Damascus from Amman on Friday.</p>

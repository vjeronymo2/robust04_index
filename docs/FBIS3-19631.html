The embassy officials have said that they are not  prepared to start a debate on the Montreux Agreement just  because of the accident. However, they also said that they are  prepared to help Turkey on matters related to the traffic in the  straits.    Embassy officials have announced that they will not make an  official statement on the incident. Nevertheless, it has been  ascertained that the Russian diplomats have discussed several  points on the Bosphorus in the assessments that have made thus  far. They are as follows:    1. The accident is the result of development. Traffic  accidents claim the lives of many people every day. However,  highways are not being closed down. In view of that, a single  incident must not be allowed to create a state of confusion.    2. Russia is prepared to do everything it can to contribute  toward the maintenance of safe passage through the straits in  Turkey. Reconsidering the Montreux Agreement, which provides  for free passage through the straits, just because an accident  has occurred in the Bosphorus, is not necessary. Therefore, we  are not prepared to reconsider the agreement.    3. A delegation arrived in Turkey in connection with the new  rules and regulations on the sea traffic in the straits and the  Sea of Marmara at the end of February. We will wait to see the  outcome of its work in order to be able to make a careful  assessment on the matter.    4. The question of traffic in the straits is not a Turkish  domestic affair. It is an international matter.    5. Each and every vessel that traverses the straits  contributes toward the safety of the traffic because the ships  have to pay a certain fee to cross the straits. The funds that  are raised in that way are used for the straits.    6. A debate is being held on how Azerbaijan's and  Kazakhstan's oil will be transported to the Western countries.  One of the options is to transport their oil to Novorossiysk in  Russia. The oil will then be transported in large tankers  through the straits in Turkey. However, considering the matter  an "imposition by Russia" would be wrong. Azerbaijan and  Kazakhstan are independent republics. In view of that, they  will have to decide. That is not a matter on which Russia  should decide.</p>

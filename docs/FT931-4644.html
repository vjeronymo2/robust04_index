			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Chemical reactions European chemicals companies are clearly reluctant to follow ICI's example by maintaining dividends through the downturn. With the exception of Akzo, all are some way behind in the process of rationalisation. Without a rights issue to support, the likes of BASF and Hoechst have little incentive to pay out more than they can afford at this uncertain stage in the chemicals cycle. That makes it difficult to interpret BASF's decision to shave only DM2 from last year's DM12 dividend. Judging by the 5 per cent rise in the shares, the market was braced for something worse. The sketchy full-year figures released yesterday suggest a better fourth quarter than expected. But it is too early to call the turn. In August, BASF was not anticipating a sustained recovery in petrochemicals until the second half of the decade. DSM, which is equally exposed to bulk chemicals and the sliding German economy, has halved its dividend in view of the bleak outlook. If BASF has tax or other short-term reasons for maintaining a relatively high payout this time, another cut can not be ruled out. The 6.5 per cent gross yield - a match for the return on German government bonds - would then be an unreliable support. If the company is trying to please investors by smoothing the dividend, though, the shares may have further to rise. BASF has a balance sheet strong enough to stand the strain of such a policy without a rights issue.</p>

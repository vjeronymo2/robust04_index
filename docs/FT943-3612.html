			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Dowding &amp; Mills achieves 33% growth Dowding &amp; Mills, the electrical and mechanical services group, lifted pre-tax profits by 33 per cent to Pounds 6.73m in the year to June 30 the back of a 9 per cent rise in turnover. Profits of Pounds 5.04m last time included exceptional costs of Pounds 628,000. Sales increased from Pounds 83.3m to Pounds 91m. Mr Jim Cole, chief executive, said that excluding exceptionals, operating profits were up 12.6 per cent at Pounds 7.2m, helped by a good performance in the US. Conditions in continental Europe continued to be difficult, although Germany had performed well. In the UK, which accounts for 60 per cent of turnover, the volume of business throughout 1993-94 had levelled out after three years of decline. The group had also been able to impose price rises in line with inflation. 'Since the end of July we have seen some improvement in the UK,' said Mr Cole. Mr Peter Hollings, the chairman, said in Australia recovery was well under way but it would take time for the new Melbourne facility to contribute to profits. During the year the company shed 35 people at a cost of Pounds 148,000, against 97 redundancies at a cost of Pounds 423,000. Net interest payable fell from Pounds 732,000 to Pounds 479,000, and gearing was reduced from 18.8 per cent to 15.3 per cent. Earnings per share rose to 2.74p (2.04p). A final dividend of 1.62p (1.58p) is proposed, taking the total to 2.56p (2.5p). The group also announced the acquisition of The Surface Flatness Co, a Manchester mechanical calibration business, for Pounds 370,000.</p>

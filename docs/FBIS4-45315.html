			<p>BFN     [Text] London, May 26 (IANS) -- Narco-terrorism has become  a "fact of life" in Kashmir with militants distributing drugs to  get new recruits, a prominent human rights activist from the  State has said.    Dr Zeenat Naquatee said a Kashmiri youth had been trapped by  terrorists. "I know of drugs being distributed from mosques to  recruit boys," she said.    "One youth is made an addict and he is told he will get the  drug if he recruits ten others. Narco-terrorism is a fact of  life in parts of the Kashmir Valley," Dr Naquatee who is from  Srinagar, said. "Many among the youth had gone insane. They  can't believe what they have done," she added.    Dr Naquatee, who is here for a Commonwealth Youth  Conference,  was speaking to journalists yesterday.    She said youths had been taken across the border with  promises of jobs and money. "They have been forced to write  letters saying all is well with them" she said. "But when the  truth has come home, these turned out to be horror stories," she  said.    She said now many Kashmiri Muslims are fleeing the Valley to  escape forced recruitment by terrorists. The youth are getting  disillusioned with terrorism, she said. "So foreigners are  coming from Afghanistan, Sudan and Pakistan. These people are  now killing Kashmiris in Kashmir" Dr Naquatee said.    She said "the terrorists speak of a freedom struggle. (But)  did Indians kill Indians when they were struggling for freedom?"  She said the terrorists have brought problems for everyone.  "It's dark in our homes. We can't go out. We don't know when  firing, killing will happen," she said.    Talking about women, Dr Naquatee said they have become the  worst victims of terrorism in the State. But she regretted that  nobody is talking about the human rights of women.    "Women have no freedom of action or movement, no education,  no medical care. Women have seen their sons snatched away to  join terrorists, their husbands forced to give money at  gunpoint," she said. There have been too many "forced  marriages," she said, adding that everyone knows about these.    "For whose independence are the terrorists fighting? For  that of terrorists trained across the border? Independence  movements come from the people and not from a handful of trained  terrorists," she said. The world had seen movements against  Communism. India had seen its independence struggle. "These  movements came from the people who did not need to be trained  across any border," Dr Naquatee said.    Dr Naquatee said the real problem was in Pakistan Occupied  Kashmir (PoK). "Unlike us, people there do not know what  democracy means" she said. Kashmiris had a peaceful alliance  with India, she said. "Otherwise people would have called  Sheikh Abdullah a traitor" she said.    Pakistan was killing Kashmiris in the name of Islam and  within Pakistan was dividing Muslims among themselves, she  alleged. Within Kashmir, she said, the majority did not want  Pakistan. "The trouble in any case is only in three or four  districts within Jammu and Kashmir," she said.    Terrorists would oppose elections because the gun has given  them power she said. "When they want money, when they want  something done by a bureaucrat, when they want something from a  shop, they get it at gunpoint," she said. But people wanted  elections, she said. "People need someone they can go and talk  to, someone who will back them," she said. "The majority is  being ordered around by a minority with guns," she said.    She said the people were caught between the terrorists and  the security forces. But the trouble had been started by  terrorists, she said. "The security forces have been there  since 1947. They have been protecting us since then. We had no  problem with them all these years," she said. The security  forces have a problem in identifying terrorists, she said. "If  there had been no sponsored terrorism, there would have been no  excesses," Dr Naquatee said.</p>

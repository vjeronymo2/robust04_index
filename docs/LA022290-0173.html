			<p><P> February 22, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY COLLEGE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> GOLDEN WEST TOPS 100 FOR FIFTH GAME IN A ROW, DOWNS ANTELOPE VALLEY  </P> <P> Shawna Armstrong scored a career-high 31 points to lead Golden West College to  a 115-61 rout of Antelope Valley in the first round of the Southern California  women's community college basketball playoffs Wednesday at Golden West.  </P> <P> Armstrong scored 23 points in the second half, including 18 on lay-ins as the  Antelope Valley defense failed to get back.  </P> <P> Armstrong, a sophomore, scored nine consecutive points to help Golden West  expand a 57-33 halftime lead into a comfortable 68-35 margin with 15:39 left.  Donna Gondringer, who scored 21 points, had the other basket in the run.  </P> <P> It was the fifth consecutive game in which Golden West has scored more than 100  or more points, tying a school record set last season. The Rustlers, the  top-ranked team in the state with a 33-1 record, are averaging 94.1 points a  game.  </P> <P> Golden West plays host to El Camino Saturday at 5 p.m. in the second round of  the playoffs. El Camino defeated Moorpark, 77-59, in another first-round game.  The winner of Saturday's game advance to the state tournament March 1-3 at  College of the Sequoias.  </P> <P> "That was typical of the games we've played all year," Golden West assistant  Coach Dave Stricklin said. "We get a big lead in the first half then just  outrun the team in the second half."  </P> <P> Gondringer added 21, Stacee Johnson 20, Claudette Jackson 16 and Bits Sirchia  had 10 as the Golden West starters all scored in double figures.  </P> <P> But it wasn't all good news for Golden West. Jackson took a hard fall early in  the second half and have to leave the game with a bruised wrist. She is  expected to be ready for Saturday's game.  </P> <P> The news isn't as good about back-up point guard Cossette Smith, who sprained  her ankle and is doubtful for Saturday's game.  </P> <P> Molly Jonnum scored 16 and Susan Hervey added 15 for Antelope Valley, which  finishes 17-11.  </P> <P> In other playoff games:  </P> <P> College of the Canyons 71, Fullerton 66 -- Tressie Millender scored 32 points,  22 in the second half, to lead Canyons over visiting Fullerton.  </P> <P> Canyons struggled in building a 33-31 first-half lead, and Fullerton took the  lead, 40-39, in the second half before Millender took control. Millender, a  5-foot-10 sophomore forward, scored seven consecutive points on a rebound  basket, a three-point shot and a layup.  </P> <P> Fullerton (16-14) refused to quit, though, and was within four points, 60-56,  with less than 10 minutes remaining. However, Millender wasn't finished either.  </P> <P> She scored seven points in a 9-0 Canyons run that put the game out of reach,  69-56.  </P> <P> Canyons (24-7) had defeated Fullerton by 30 points earlier in the season, but  the Hornets had played the first game without point guard Candi Burnett and  forward Kris Kelley, who missed that game due to disciplinary action. Burnett  scored 23 points in the rematch, and Kelley scored 10.  </P> <P> Ventura 62, Orange Coast 54 -- Orange Coast's most successful season (26-6)  come to an end in the first round of the playoffs at home. Sophomore Chris  Roayls scored a game-high 21 on 10-of-15 shooting from the floor and added 12  rebounds for Ventura.  </P> <P> She broke a 54-54 tie with a lay-up with 3:31 left. OCC led, 49-46, with 8:18  but Ventura's Suzanne Hoag scored three consecutive baskets to put the Pirates  ahead, 52-49, two minutes later. Erika Manning had 13 points, Kami Bigler 12,  and Michelle Hennessey 10 for OCC.  </P></p>

			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / Finance and the Family: Surveys agree, house prices are inching up - At a glance HOUSE prices rose by a seasonally-adjusted 0.9 per cent in July after falls in May and June, according to the Halifax house price index. Nationwide found that prices rose by 0.7 per cent in July, the fifth monthly rise in succession according to its index. Adrian Coles, director-general of the Council of Mortgage Lenders, said that the housing market was slowly recovering and that recent mortgage lending figures were 'very encouraging'. The figures released by the council this week show that net new lending rose to Pounds 4.1bn in the second quarter, up from Pounds 2.9bn in the first quarter. However, the second quarter figure is still lower than the Pounds 5.2bn of net new advances for the same period last year.</p>

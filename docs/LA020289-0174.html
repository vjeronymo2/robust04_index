			<p><P> February 2, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA: SOCKERS PLACE 5 ON ALL-STAR TEAM  </P> <P> The Sockers have placed five players, more than any other Major Indoor Soccer  League team, on this season's All-Star team, it was announced Wednesday.  </P> <P> Midfielders Branko Segota and Brian Quinn, defender Kevin Crow, and goalkeepers  Zoltan Toth and Victor Nogueira were picked to play in the Feb. 22 game at  Reunion Arena in Dallas. Players could not vote for teammates.  </P> <P> Because the MISL isn't divided into divisions this season, All-Stars from six  teams will play the host Dallas Sidekicks.  </P> <P> Segota and Crow will be appearing for the fifth consecutive season. Segota has  played in seven games. Toth will be in his fifth game, and Quinn in his fourth,  but both may miss it because of injuries.  </P> <P> Nogueira, who leads the league with a 2.44 goals-against average, will be  making his first appearance.  </P> <P> The first-place Baltimore Blast placed three players, and every other team in  the league has two. Kim Roentved of Kansas City was named to his eighth  All-Star team, tying him with Steve Zungul for the most appearances. CHRIS ELLO  </P></p>

			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / Markets: Kingfisher's muted song - The Bottom Line Retail lore has it that Sir Geoffrey Mulcahy, chairman of the Kingfisher retail group, even has a yacht called No Comment. A shy, diffident man, he is an unlikely-seeming retail guru. That role was thrust upon him, however, after his skilful piloting through the 1980s' boom of what was then called Woolworth Holdings. And people listened when he began talking about the need for a new retailing approach in the low-growth 1990s, involving lowering margins to drive sales volumes and increase market share. Mulcahy's most recent coup was the Pounds 1bn takeover last year of Darty, France's largest electrical retailer and one of Europe's best. Unfortunately, the reluctant guru's 'halo has slipped', as one retail analyst put it. By the time Kingfisher announced its results this week, its shares - long star performers of the stores sector - had dropped 22 per cent since a disappointing trading statement in January raised fears that Kingfisher's Everyday Low Pricing (EDLP) strategy was not working. And since the results on Wednesday, its shares have dropped a further 20p, closing at 550p yesterday. That must be irksome for a company which produced a 51 per cent rise in pre-tax profits for the year to January 29 from Pounds 204.8m to Pounds 309.3m. But the profits increase was largely down to a Pounds 79.2m contribution from Darty, a rise in the contribution from the group's property arm from Pounds 8.1m to Pounds 43m, and a smaller than expected interest charge of Pounds 7.6m. Profits from UK retailing actually fell, with three of Kingfisher's four main chains reporting a decline. Only B&amp;Q, the DIY chain, showed a narrow increase. That is disappointing given that B&amp;Q, Superdrug and Woolworth all enjoyed increases in like-for-like sales, which exclude new stores. The point is that as margins have been trimmed as part of the everyday low pricing strategy, sales have increased - but not enough to compensate for the gross margin sacrifice. Sir Geoff insists EDLP is a long-term process and the sales volumes will come through eventually. But, with Kingfisher's EDLP campaign now a year old, City analysts are asking how long that might take and whether the group has got the strategy right. There were other reasons for the UK retail businesses' poor performance. Woolworth was hit by an unexpected collapse in the video games and consoles market. Superdrug was in the process of shifting its focus to personal care products, moving away from household and grocery ranges. Moreover, some retail experts say the City is being characteristically short-sighted in expecting profits to shoot ahead as a result of Kingfisher's new strategy. They say it takes time for consumers to get the low-price message on the kind of infrequent purchases in which some of its chains, particularly Comet, specialise. Analysts counter that in high-street chains, such as Woolworth and Superdrug, the benefits of EDLP should have come through more quickly. There are reasons to retain faith in Kingfisher. Darty has been hit by the downturn in the French economy, with sales and operating profits down, but it increased its share of a declining market. When the French recovery begins, the company should reap the benefits. There is also more progress to be made in exploiting the synergies between Darty and Comet, and bringing the latter chain up to the standards of the former. Looking further ahead, some analysts are enthusiastic about the prospects for B&amp;Q Warehouses (previously called The Depot), the 100,000 sq ft DIY giants Kingfisher is developing. The benefits of these developments, like those of EDLP, will take time to come through. Although Kingfisher's shares now look cheap, anyone contemplating buying them may need large reserves of patience. But, concluded one analyst yesterday: 'Kingfisher still has an excellent track record of both earnings and share price growth. Shareholders might be foolish to sell them at this level.'</p>

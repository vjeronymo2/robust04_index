			<p>940128 FT  28 JAN 94 / Markets Report: Yen rises against dollar The yen gained ground yesterday against the dollar as political and economic uncertainty in Japan remained the focus of currency market attention, writes Philip Gawith. Although the Japanese currency traded slightly firmer, the market remains unable to take a clear view on the way ahead. Two parallel sets of events - US/Japan trade talks, and the troubles of the government - continue to pull the market in opposite directions. Meanwhile, the Bank of France's newly formed monetary council yesterday kept the market in the dark by declining to reveal whether or not it had made a decision on the lowering of interest rates. The yen closed in London at Y109.415 to the dollar, up from Wednesday's Y110.420, bolstered by bearish comments from Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US Treasury secretary. It finished in New York at Y108.60. Mr Bentsen complained about the low level of import penetration into Japan and said more action was required to help the economy. 'Market penetration by foreign products in Japan is too low. Likewise with foreign investment levels,' Mr Bentsen said in remarks for delivery to the US Chamber of Commerce. There is, however, a view in the market that if a fiscal package looks like being delayed, the Bank of Japan may be forced to step in and offer an economic stimulus by lowering interest rates. This gained support yesterday from a report quoting a Bank of Japan official as saying that exchange rates should reflect fundamentals rather than politics. IDEA, in its financial markets commentary, said the statement meant that the 'BOJ is ready to step in if yen gains accelerate'. There are also reports that the dollar enjoys support at Y109.05 from buy orders placed by Japanese life offices. Mr Hosokawa, the prime minister, said he would not hang on to power if his poli-tical reform package were thwarted. Analysts said this increased the prospect of an early election. The four-bill reform package must pass by tomorrow, when the parliamentary session ends, or lapse. One angle to the Japanese story is whether it will check the rise of the Australian dollar, which closed yesterday in London at USDollars 0.7095, a rise of nearly 11 per cent from USDollars 0.6410 at the end of October. Mr Chris Turner, currency strategist at BZW, said the Australian dollar, which was now looking overbought, should be sensitive to events in Japan, which takes about 25 per cent of Australian exports. While the Australian currency has already factored in the weak state of the Japanese economy, observers believe it would take a knock if the Japanese government fails to pass a political and economic package. Analysts expressed surprise that the US dollar did not make further ground after the release of strong durable goods sales figures. Apart from weakening against the yen, it dipped to DM1.7441 from Wednesday's DM1.748. It fell in New York trading to end at DM1.7290. Analysts said investors were unwilling to take long dollar positions while Japanese policy remained on hold. The market is expecting a good number today when US fourth quarter GDP figures are released. Expectations range from 4 to 7 per cent. Sterling softened, finishing in London at DM2.6031 after Wednesday's DM2.6089, and at Dollars 1.4925, off from Dollars 1.4926. Dealers said the strong economic signals of recent weeks had tailed off in the last few days. A further technical factor keeping the pound down was its repeated failure to break through the Dollars 1.50 level. Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, governor of the Bank of France, yesterday announced the bank's monetary targets for 1994, but kept silent on the question of interest rate cuts. He said the central bank's policy council had decided to target average annual M3 growth at around 5 per cent over roughly four years. French M3 rose by only 1.4 per cent last year, excluding exceptional items, in spite of a target range of 4.0 to 6.5 per cent. Mr Trichet declined to make any predictions on official rates, saying: 'It is the privilege of central bankers never to say anything in advance.' He said the Bank of France's monetary policy objective in 1994 was to maintain price stability. Mr Turner of BZW said he did not think there was any large currency message in the bank's announcement other than the bank 'making clear that it had no intention of delinking policy from the Bundesbank'. Many Turkish banks refrained yesterday from dollar trading with the market thrown into disarray by the government's 11.97 per cent devaluation of the Turkish lira. Bankers said the central bank wanted to show it had a firm grip on currency markets with early action, after 10 days of turmoil which sent the lira plunging against the dollar. The bank intervened in the market, selling the dollar and pushing it down to TL16,000 from TL18,000, but it rose again to end at TL16,000-16,500. The Bank of England yesterday provided the UK money market with about Pounds 950m of late assistance. Earlier the Bank had provided Pounds 481m of assistance. The revised liquidity shortage was Pounds 1.55bn, up from an initial Pounds 1.4bn forecast. German call money rose after the Bundesbank withdrew DM7bn via its weekly tender for securities repurchase funds. Banks quoted call money at between 6.50 and 6.65 per cent.</p>

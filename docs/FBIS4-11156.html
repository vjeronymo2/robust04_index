			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by PRENSA LATINA reporter Nicanor Leon Cotayo </F> from the "Evening Information Review" newscast]    [Text] The effects of the U.S. blockade on Cuba reared  their heads in a particularly harsh fashion in the first months  of 1994. Contrary to what happened over the previous three  years, several effects of the siege have landed simultaneous  blows on the Cuban people, particularly hurting their food  supply and some areas of the public health system. It is  important to recall that since 6 July 1960, almost 34 years ago,  the U.S. Government has stopped buying sugar from the island.  One of the main objectives of the blockade was to try to curb  as much as possible the inflow of foreign financial resources  essential to Havana in its efforts to keep its economy afloat  and meet the basic needs of Cubans.    Last year, because of limited exchange opportunities;  because  of the lack of imports required by the sugar harvest -- oil, for  instance; and because of bad whether, Cuban sugar production,  still a key component in the national economy, fell to just more  than 4 million tons, which is much lower than the 7 million tons  produced during the previous harvest. This drastic drop in  production not only caused the country to stop receiving more  than $400 million a year amid an already difficult situation,  but it also created difficulties in distributing sugar among the  people, who were already facing many other difficulties in the  January-March period in terms of delivery dates, although,  ultimately, distribution was achieved as planned.    The lack of raw materials affected not only the sugar  industry, but also the agriculture sector in which tuber and  vegetable production declined. The shortage of agricultural  produce was highly visible in terms of the supply of these  products in this period. If these examples, among others, are  combined with the trade transactions with other countries which  Washington's embassies and special services have tried to wreck  -- for example, the purchase of Asian cooking oil to meet  first-quarter needs -- then we get a sad idea of what is going  on in this Caribbean country. Should we want to expand on this a  bit more, we would have to remember the painful path travelled  by Cuba in Latin America to buy powdered milk for newborn  babies, because suppliers feared White House retaliation or  because some ships dropped their loads in ports of other  Caribbean nations. If those ships had docked in Cuban ports  with the powdered milk on board, they could be severely  penalized upon their arrival in U.S. ports because of provisions  in the Torricelli Law.    Some day, when details of how Cuban life was affected by the  U.S. blockade, and when the information blockade and distortions  no longer cloud the island's achievements, reality will easily  win out over fantasy. Meanwhile, Cuba shows no signs of  surrendering; although life goes on very much affected by  difficulties primarily caused by the blockade, we are  maintaining the ironhanded notion of not sacrificing our  national freedom.</p>

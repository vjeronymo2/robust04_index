			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with NP spokesman Piet Coetzer and ANC PWV </F> Regional Secretary Paul Mashatile by announcers Reggie Morobe  and Xoli Mazibuko on the `Newsline' program -- live]    [Text] [Morobe] We are now joined in the studio by an ANC  [African National Congress] and a National Party representative.  I must admit that we had invited the PAC [Pan Africanist  Congress] and it acknowledged receipt of our invitation, but the  gentleman or lady who was supposed to represent them is not here  yet. Let me welcome the gentlemen here, Mr Mashatile and Mr  Coetzer. Good evening and welcome to you gentlemen.    Perhaps it would be wise to start with you Mr Coetzer and  look at the history. This one might say is part of the history  that your apartheid policies created. We saw some victims  there, we saw some hardships which people went through. How do  you explain this today?    [Coetzer] Well, I don't think that one can really explain  history, or explain it away. I think what is important is that  we remember, first of all, that we tried to learn from history  and the mistakes of the past and use these celebrations -- if  you want to -- as a day of remembrance as well as a day of  reconciliation. I personally have some vivid memories of that  day. I was a 14-year-old boy growing up in Vanderbijlpark right  next to Sharpeville. So it left some emotional impressions on  me as well. I was lucky I grew up in a home where my parents  taught me to respect people and I experienced Sharpeville in a  certain way. And I think that we should join hands to ensure  that our country never slips into that kind of situation again.    [Morobe] So you're not trying to reap, perhaps out of  people's tragedy, you're not trying to reap a point here by  saying that you want to convert people's tragedy into  reconciliation, how do you put that right?    [Coetzer] Well, the fact of the matter is: If we're going  to just relive the animosities of the past, then we will not  build a new nation, and I think that is the challenge of today.  It is to learn from the past and to construct a better future  for all the children of South Africa.    [Morobe] Let's come to Mr. Mashatile, I'll give you a chance  just now. How do you read the day?    [Mashatile] Firstly, let me say that we are shocked to hear  about the death of 21 prisoners in Queenstown Prison today. I  would like to firstly send our sympathies to the families of  those who died, and hope that this matter will be given the  necessary attention. Coming back to Sharpeville. Sharpeville  to us is the day in which we remember the struggles of our  people who faced the brutality of the National Party regime, and  we are saying that it is a day in which we draw courage that  our people fought relentlessly. They were facing a violent  system of oppression, and fought all the way to ensure that  today we are on the brink of a new South Africa. And in fact I  want to say that today, in particular this year, we are seeing  Sharpeville in a different context. Our theme today was Never  Again and we are saying that in the future of this country never  again shall people be brutally murdered as it happened in the  past. Never again shall there be massacres of innocent people  when they protest and have legitimate grievances, and we are  saying that we mark this day today to close that chapter, the  chapter of brutality and murder through state authorities. And  we are saying that we are moving toward a new era, but we will  always remember that we were under a system that ruled people  through terror, through brutality and murder.    [Morobe] What about the fact that now Mr. Coetzer here  speaks of reconciliation, he wants to look back on the day as a  day of reconciliation? Do you want to read that from now on?  After the elections, how do you look at Sharpeville, the 21st?    [Mashatile] Yes, we are for reconciliation. In fact, when  our president came out of prison, the first thing that he said  was that we should work for reconciliation. The pint I'm making  is that we will always remember where we come from, and that  Sharpeville has to be remembered not only as a particular day  where we remember people who were killed -- the 69 people who  were killed -- but as a reflection of the kind off system that  we went through to go where we are going now, and of course  after April the 27th we will be embarking on programs to ensure  that we build a new country. Nation-building is our program, and  we have a plan to ensure that when we say never again, it's not  just a slogan but we're going to put in place mechanisms that  are going to ensure that we don't only transform the political  system, but the entire security systems and the police are going  to be reformed to ensure that they are open and they are  accountable to the communities so that the brutality of the past  should never surface again.    [Morobe] On the issue of reconciliation. Let me start by  asking Mr Coetzer: What did the National Party today actually  do to mark this day -- your role in this day?    [Coetzer] I think it would be wrong for the National Party  to try and -- especially at this point in time -- to get too  directly involved, I think in what is a day of remembrance, I  think in the present emotional situation would be a wrong step.  I think the important thing for us at this stage is to look on  the occasion of remembrance with dignity, to take a low profile,  and to keep on reaching out the hand and say: Let's build the  future, let's use opportunities in the future to create  reconciliation.    But I accept, yes, that we are coming to the end of an  episode in our history, and it's important that one finishes  those chapters and get it [as heard] behind us.    [Morobe] When you say finish, I find it a little bit  difficult in terms of... [pauses] we are talking here of  massacres. We are talking here of.. [pauses] the whole attack  was unleashed to the nation. If you say finish, are you infering  that the people should forget what happened?    [Coetzer] No, no, I'm not saying that we should forget. As I  said right from the start, we should remember, yes, we should  remember. And we should remember in such a way that we learn  from the mistakes of the past. All of us have made mistakes.  This was a horrible mistake. It was a tragedy, and yes,  together we must ensure that those sort of tragedies don't  happen in future again. So I'm not asking that we should forget.  What we're asking for, is let's start building a joint future,  and get the divided past behind us.    [Morobe] When you're talking about building, we have seen  people who have been maimed, we've seen what has happened. Now  where are you going to start? Are you going to start by  compensating the people?    [Coetzer] Well, let me say as far as those sorts of subjects  are concerned, at the national negotiations various mechanisms  had been negotiated by all the major role players involved to  ensure that there could be some redresses on some of the issues.  That is something that has been negotiated. Remember now, if  we're talking about compensation for instance, we're moving  after the 27th of April toward a Government of National Unity  for the next five years which will create the ideal platform for  us jointly to address programs of reconciliation.    [Morobe] But are you not seeing that as part of your  responsibility now, also a gesture of showing what  reconciliation is all about in terms of attending to...[pauses]  some of them, I mean, since then they've never been able to lead  a normal life. Wouldn't that be your responsibility as now the  government?    [Coetzer] Well, let me say there is a month left before the  election. I think that it would be seen as cheap politicking if  we tried to now quickly do something, and I think that would be  wrong to try and use an occasion like this for narrow party  political gain. As we've seen in the insert, I think that  Sharpeville has already taken on a wider meaning. Sharpeville  was triggered by the PAC, but it's not the PAC only that is  involved in the remembrance any more, and I think that that is  the challenge -- to broaden the base of remembrance. Each of us  will remember it in our own way. The important thing is that we  don't misuse this at this point in time just for points scoring.  I'm not saying that anybody is doing that at this point in  time. But I think to ask us to do something quickly now would  be wrong. We've negotiated proper structures that can attend to  this, and on a joint basis. We have 5 years of a Government of  National Unity in front of us. The challenge is to build that  national unity.    [Morobe] Paul, Pieter Coetzer is talking about cheap  politicking. Is the ANC not using this as part of the election  campaigning -- cheap politicking on the whole issue of the  Sharpeville massacre?    [Mashatile] No, no. I mean, we have always remembered  Sharpeville. It's not the first time today. We can never have  any cheap politicking. I am saying that Sharpeville, in many  respects, is a sad day for us because those who were killed are  our people, killed in the context of their fight against  oppression. We are saying today that we have to remember where  we come from. We must remember that today as we are looking  forward to a new Government of National Unity and so on, we must  remember what brought us where we are. We are here because of  our people standing up against brutal oppression, and therefore  there is no cheap politicking. What we need to do today is to  begin to say: How are we going to ensure, as South Africans,  that what happened in Sharpeville on 21 March 1960 does not  happen again. I'm saying the ANC has a plan to ensure that that  should never happen again.    [Morobe] Now the ANC has a plan. I asked Piet Coetzer  whether they are going to compensate the people. What is the  ANC's plan towards that?    [Mashatile] Well, our plan is a bigger plan because what  happened in Sharpeville happened because of a system, a system  that was in place that ensured that police in this country were  trained to protect that system and if need be, protect it  brutally and use all sorts of methods, terror and so on. Now  our plan, firstly, is to ensure that that system must go. The  system of apartheid must go, you must bring into place a  democratic system, bring about a new government, accountable  government, a government of the people that will ensure that the  security forces are there to serve the people. Once you have  that plan in place, then you'd make sure that you never have  police in this country that are going to do anything that goes  against the people, but will do everything to protect the  people. Now the bigger challenge for this country is to remove  that system, and on 27 April we are saying that that system will  be gone, and we'll have a new system that will then put into  place that big plan that will be driven by the new government,  of course, a Government of National Unity, as Piet Coetzer has  said, to begin to build reconciliation, nation-building, but  more importantly, to ensure that the kind of revelations that we  are seeing today, of supplying arms to people by top generals  does not take place. That is the plan that we have.    [Mazibuko] Let me just stick with you again, Paul, here.  Within the same context of a plan that you are mentioning, I've  seen the (?agony) in Sharpeville today. The platform is being  used more as a campaigning platform towards elections. How do  you rectify the people's sorrow vis-a-vis the campaigning for  votes?    [Mashatile] Well, our campaign is part of our struggle.  Election campaign, to us, is not a child's play. It's not a  game, it's part and parcel of the continuation of the struggle  that has been fought over 300 years, and therefore any platform,  whether it is a funeral, whether it is a commemoration service  of people who have died in this struggle, must be seen as part  of that struggle. So we are saying today, when we talk about  elections and a new government and a need to vote, we are  expressing the will of those people who died in the course of  this struggle, and therefore we have a duty to express that  those people who died in Sharpeville were not going to steal  some sugar somewhere. Those people were expressing the fact  that they do not accept the system of oppression that imposed  the pass system on them. This coming election is addressing  that system, to remove it, therefore we must speak about  elections in days like the Sharpeville day today.    [Mazibuko] So you don't see any dichotomy in terms of  politicking, or cheap politicking, as you used the term earlier?    [Mashatile] No, no, because people died in context of  struggle. If we don't talk about the need to vote in meetings  like this, we will be betraying those people who had fallen in  the course of the struggle, seeking this new change. So it is  in the interests of the entire oppressed people to ensure that  any given chance, whatever advances the course of the struggle  must be on the top of our agenda.    [Mazibuko] OK, let's come to you, Piet Coetzer. It comes  back here to some people's minds -- they say all the National  Party has done is now in the nineties, it's only taken us 34  years back. There were peaceful protests then, people were  trying to express a desire. It's only now that you are coming  back to that. In real terms, there is no real reform that you  have come up with.    [Coetzer] Well, let me say, first of all, in reaction to the  question of ANC plans, and ANC plans for reconciliation. I  think that's a dangerous approach. That's one of the mistakes  we made in the past, and that was, that one party alone tried to  make plans. Apartheid is already dead. We are already busy with  reconstructing a future. A joint plan was made and negotiated  at the constitutional negotiations. We're in the process of  executing, jointly that plan. The pass laws were scrapped 9  years ago. In 1985 already the pass laws were scrapped. That  is not an issue of this campaign. What should be an issue of  this campaign is how we are going to reconstruct South Africa,  how we're going to build a better future. I must say I find it  a little bit disturbing if one party is trying to say that they  alone will make plans. That is against the whole spirit of what  was negotiated, against the whole spirit of a Government of  National Unity. Yes, plans must be made, yes, some plans have  already been made, and are waiting for execution by a government  of national unity, joint plans. That's what we need now.    [Mazibuko] OK, fine. Move on then to the issue of taking us  34 years ago. There were peaceful protests.    [Coetzer] Yes. I say again, Sharpeville was a tragic  mistake. It's not the only mistake that was made. There were  other mistakes made, many mistakes made on all sides. But I  don't think today that what South Africa needs is for  accusations to be thrown across. That will bring us nowhere.  What we must talk about is, what have we learned from the past,  and...    [Mazibuko, interrupting] What is it that you have learned  from the past, because here we've seen... [pauses] your reply  has been more repression when people came up with such protests,  it's been more repression. What's your new reply now?    [Coetzer] Well, what I'm saying is, one of the plans that  have already been negotiated is a joint negotiated constitution  that will take us to free democratic elections. One of the  plans that has been made jointly is a Government of National  Unity. The biggest mistake we can make -- and repeating the  past -- is for one party on its own to try and make plans for  everybody. The point is, we're going into an election that will  ensure that we have a truly representative government, but a  Government of National Unity, that should jointly build a new  future.    [Mazibuko] OK, gentlemen, I want you to give me -- I'm  moving  towards the end of this discussion now -- I want you to give me  the plans of what you see for the day. What do you see after  the elections if we commemorate or we have a day of remembrance,  what do you see as 21 March under a new dispensation, perhaps  the government of national unity?    [Mashatile] Well, as I said earlier, the first step to us is  that we must work towards elections, get everybody to vote for  the party of their choice, and ensure that we bring into place a  new government. That is the first step. That government will  then begin to implement a plan to redress the imbalances of the  past. When I talk about the plan, I'm not saying that there is  no new constitution negotiated which is a joint plan; there's no  Government of National Unity. All I'm saying is that when we go  into that Government of National Unity we must have a plan as  the ANC, and we welcome all other parties...    [Mazibuko, interrupting] What is the plan?    [Mashatile] Our plan is that we have to reform the security  forces. We must ensure that we have a transparent and  accountable police force; a police force that will work closely  with the communities. We have already in fact started that  process, we are discussing with a lot of people, including the  South African Police, so that when the political system changes,  we don't only change the political system, but we change all  other institutions of the state that are going to be ensuring  that the lives of our people change, and reforming the police is  one of those plans.    [Coetzer] I would like to return to Sharpeville Day per se,  and you ask me how do I see Sharpeville Day in the future? I  think that one must, first of all, see it in a broader context.  I think that we need to sit down as part of the process of  reconstruction and reconciliation after the election, and that  is to reevaluate all our public holidays. I can foresee a day  in the near future, come next year, when Sharpeville Day could  be one of the public holidays, a day of remembrance. Yes, there  are other public holidays like the Day of the Vow which is very  important to Afrikaner people, that needs to be addressed. I  think that we need to address jointly that whole broader issue  and create a way in which we remain sensitive for one another's  past and the things that are important to one another.    [Mazibuko] Mr. Coetzer, I'm afraid I have to cut you there.  We have completely run out of time. Thank you for coming  through, Mr. Mashatile.    [Coetzer] Thank you very much for the opportunity.</p>

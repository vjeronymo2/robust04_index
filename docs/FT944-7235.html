			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Business Post rises sharply to Pounds 3.8m Shares in Business Post, the express parcel delivery company, rose 15p to 154p yesterday, after it revealed that the recent expansion of its network of hubs helped achieve 24 per cent sales growth and improved profit margins. Pre-tax profits rose 74 per cent to Pounds 3.81m (Pounds 2.19m) in the six months to September 30, well ahead of analysts' expectations, and the company said the momentum was continuing. October sales rose 26 per cent. The group sustained average price rises of 1.6 per cent in April, despite what remains an extremely competitive market, given the existence of about 20 competitors with national networks. In addition, it was now reaping the benefits of increased capacity and a more efficient network, following investment in the expansion of several regional 'hubs'. Turnover rose from Pounds 19.1m to Pounds 23.6m and operating profit margins increased from 11.7 per cent to 15.6 per cent. This partly reflected the high level of fixed costs within the business. The trend should be more pronounced in the second half, as the business has a seasonal bias because of the summer lull. Last year, 55 per cent of Business Post's revenue came in the second half. In addition, UK Mail, its door-to-door mail delivery service was suspended in March, after contributing losses in the second half of 1993/1994. Capital expenditure peaked in 1993, falling from Pounds 2.34m to Pounds 1.73m at the interim stage. It is likely to stay at about that level in the second half. It is increasing the dividend by 58 per cent to 1.9p (1.2p), roughly in line with earnings per share, which rose 55 per cent to 5.1p (3.3p).</p>

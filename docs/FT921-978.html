			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / Cresson cabinet faces reshuffle The French prime minister, Mrs Edith Cresson, said yesterday that her cabinet would be reshuffled following the rout of her Socialist party in last Sunday's regional elections, Reuter reports from Paris. Mrs Cresson, whose popularity has fallen to record lows, was asked on television whether cabinet changes could be expected after a second round of voting next Sunday. 'There will certainly be changes in the government. Yes, I think so.' Mrs Cresson would not say whether she might lose her job, as has been widely forecast. France's unemployment rate edged closer to the 10 per cent level in February, AP-DJ reports from Paris. Overall unemployment rose to 2,449,000, or 9.9 per cent, from 9.8 per cent.</p>

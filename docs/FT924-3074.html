			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / Survey of Global Custody (16): Tailor-made systems - Alan Cane discusses information technology INFORMATION technology makes modern global custody services possible at an economic price. Without efficient data transmission, processing and electronic document interchange to keep track of share certificates and dividend payments and to ensure that currencies are translated accurately, global custodians would be forced to rely on telex and manual processing; time-consuming, costly and prone to errors. Against this must be set the substantial investment in computers and computer software which serious players have to make; software packages running on personal computers may cost tens of thousands of dollars but for a large system running on a mainframe computer, the base price is several million dollars. Banks writing their own bespoke software will be able to create systems tailored to their exact needs and such developments are never cheap. Lloyds Bank in the UK, for example, is one of those developing its own system; it is using ACT's Quasar investment management package as the basis for its development. It will say little about the functions its system will support or about its progress, arguing that other custodians could gain useful insights from such information. Its reluctance to give anything away speaks volumes for the level of competition in the market today. The development of computer systems for global custody is following the pattern established for most financial software over the past three decades. In the beginning, banks developed their own systems either on their own or with the assistance of a software house. Some of these developments proved robust and flexible enough to be packaged and sold to other institutions. Now a new generation of products is emerging based on 'open systems' principles. Open software obeys industry standards, enabling it to run on a wide range of standard hardware; a typical advantage in open systems software is the graphical user interface (gui); computer operations are indicated on the screen by small pictures rather than by text. There are also developments in ways of connecting customers to their custodians which are reminiscent of the vogue for treasurer's workstations a decade ago. There are three basic approaches. The simplest is a dumb terminal which can be connected through a dial-up link to the custodian's computer. This allows portfolio inspection, but not much more. The next stage is to download data from the custodian's system to the customer's personal computer; this makes possible more elaborate reports and instructions to be transmitted. The final sophistication is a direct computer to computer connection which essentially gives the customer privileged access direct to the custodian's computer system. Typically, the customer will use a personal computer or workstation; guis make the process of interaction that much easier. The trend among global custodians is towards packaged software rather than systems written in-house, reflecting both costs and the flexibility which can be built into packages through modular and parameter-driven construction. There are now some 40 packages which run on specific manufacturers' hardware and almost as many open systems offerings. The leading proprietary packages include VSPS, developed by Vista Concepts of the US, Omni GS from Dyatron, Fundmaster from BIS and Paladign, written by Clarke and Tilley in the UK. Leading open systems packages include GSM also from the Dyatron stable, Synopsis from RIMS and Belvedere GPS, developed by Belvedere Europe. VSPS from Vista Concepts is the market leader in top-of-the-line systems. It costs typically from Dollars 1m to Dollars 10m. It is an on-line system offering multicurrency, multilingual real-time processing. Data need only be entered once. It deals with clearing, settlement and customer reporting. Newer features include provisions for handling a variety of new financial instruments together with advanced portfolio reports and money management. But a principal advantage, according to Vista Concepts' founder Bill Potter is its flexibility. It can be modified to suit individual customers's needs. For this reason, it has been chosen as the basis of Taurus, the London Stock Exchange's much delayed settlement system. According to Mr Potter, The Vista Concept's team is on time with its share of the development work. VSPS grew out of a project commissioned by the Banque National de Paris; now it is used by Citibank and Chase Manhattan in the US and Midland Bank in the UK.</p>

"That justice was finally done is very important." Jones, 37,  a Jamaican, had been accused of possessing a fraction of a gram of cocaine that  was found in her handbag in a police raid last April 8 on a suburban Kingston  mansion. She pleaded innocent. Jones had testified last month that she believed  Michelle Knight, her husband's ex-lover, had planted the drugs in her handbag.  </P></p>

			<p>940221 FT  21 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Ageist attitude will deter best brains Sir, With reference to John Major's exhortation to the best brains to enter industry ('PM asks top brains to enter industry', February 12-13), can anyone really advocate having a working life of only 25 years? Assuming the best brains are graduates, they will not enter industry until they are 21. Judging by the job advertisements, and current recruiting practices, they will not be employable after the age of 45. Effectively they have to earn enough in 25 years to keep themselves for the next 30 years. Is that really an attractive proposition? Until industry changes its ageist attitude, it does not deserve to have the best brains. M J Feinson, 11 Seagry Road, London E11 2NG</p>

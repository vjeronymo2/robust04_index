			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Regarding underpayments, the current &sect;404.503(b), which reflects section 204(d) of the Act, provides that if an individual dies before receiving a title II benefit payment, the underpayment so created is payable to a person or persons in an order of priority as specified in that section. Paragraph (3) of &sect;404.503(b) provides that if there is no one higher in the order of priority, the underpayment may be paid to the ``parent or parents of the deceased individual (as defined in &sect;404.374) entitled to monthly benefit on the basis of the same earnings record as was the deceased individual'' in the month of death. Under paragraph (6) of &sect;404.503(b), if there is no one higher in the order of priority, the underpayment may be paid to the ``parent or parents of the deceased individual (as defined in &sect;404.374) who do not qualify under paragraph (b)(3).'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 404.374 defines ``parent'' as the natural, adoptive, or stepparent of an  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> insured <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  person and is based on the statutory requirements for eligibility for benefits as the parent of an insured worker. However, these stringent criteria are not required for purposes of receiving an underpayment. Section 204(d) (3) and (6) of the Act require only that the individual be the parent of the deceased underpaid beneficiary. The cross reference to &sect;404.374 in &sect;404.503(b) (3) and (6) results in an unduly restrictive definition of a parent who is eligible for an underpayment. We are, therefore, proposing to revise &sect;404.503(b) (3) and (6) so that for purposes of eligibility for an underpayment, the definition of ``parent'' in &sect;404.374 is extended to a parent of any deceased individual who was entitled to social security benefits. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regarding overpayments, we are amending &sect;404.510, which lists the situations where an individual may be considered to be ``without fault'' for accepting an incorrect benefit payment. Paragraph ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> l <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) of that section explains that the overpaid individual may be ``without fault'' in causing the overpayment if he or she reasonably believed that net earnings from self-employment after attaining age 72 in a taxable year would not be cause for deductions from benefits for months in the year of attaining age 72 that are before the month of attainment. For months after 1982, the age at which social security beneficiaries are no longer subject to an earnings test has been reduced from age 72 to age 70. This reduction from age 72 to 70 is based on section 302 of Pub. L. 95&hyph;216 (the Social Security Amendments of 1977) which became effective for months after December 1982, as provided in section 2204 of Pub. L. 97&hyph;35 (the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981). We are, therefore, revising &sect;404.510( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> l <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) to change age 72 to age 70 for months after December 1982. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Our final amendment in these regulations is to delete Albania and the German Democratic Republic from the list in &sect;404.460 of countries to which the Department of the Treasury will not send benefit checks. On November 7, 1991, The Department of the Treasury removed the German Democratic Republic from the Withheld Check List set out in 31 CFR 211.1 by publishing final rules in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  at 56 FR 56931. On September 30, 1992, the Department removed Albania from the list by publishing final rules in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  at 57 FR 44998. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> April 28, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DAVID NELSON ON RESTAURANTS: TALENTED HOME-GROWN CHEF IS BACK  </P> <P> Doug Organ, the peripatetic wunderkind (and, at times, enfant terrible) of San  Diego cooking, has come home to roost, and not a moment too soon.  </P> <P> Older and perhaps wiser after a brief apprenticeship in the kitchen at the  celebrated Taillevent in Paris, Organ has returned to his forte, which is  serving San Diegans imaginative, thoughtful cuisine of the kind that nearly  vanished from the scene when Gustaf Anders closed its doors.  </P> <P> Organ, who began cooking at Frederick's in Solana Beach while still in his  teens (and proved so talented that proprietor Chuck Frederick soon found  himself working as sous chef under his own employee), is one of a tiny handful  of home-grown chefs to have made a name for himself in the county. After  spending some years at Frederick's, he opened the much-praised but ultimately  unsuccessful 926 in Pacific Beach.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Menu Proved Popular  </P> <P> With wine expert and partner Gary Parker, Organ opened the WineSellar &amp;  Brasserie in late December. The two originally expected the Brasserie to be  something of an adjunct to the wine shop, and opened the restaurant on a  restricted basis that included lunch service on weekdays and dinner on weekend  nights only. Organ's menus, however, generated sufficient interest that dinner  now is offered Tuesday through Saturday.  </P> <P> The fact that dinner reservations can be difficult to obtain on short notice  testifies to Organ's popularity, because the restaurant is well off the beaten  track on Waples Street, a short thoroughfare in the new zone of industrial and  office developments springing up along the western stretch of Mira Mesa  Boulevard. The wine shop occupies ground-floor space in the middle of an  immense, warehouse-like structure, and the Brasserie is up the stairs in a  pleasant, low-key room that looks across a wine bar at Organ's open kitchen.  </P> <P> Organ pairs a standing menu with a daily supplement that lists several extra  appetizers and entrees as well as the evening's selection of desserts. At many  restaurants, the most interesting dishes consistently will be found on the  specials card, but at the Brasserie, both sides of the menu are reliable guides  to good eating.  </P> <P> The showiest first course, the grilled lamb salad, is substantial, pretty and  typical of Organ's style, which can be regarded as updated classic French, and  could be called, quite simply, contemporary cuisine. Slices of rare meat fan  out over a bed of wilted spinach and other greens, with crumbles of salty,  pungent feta cheese used almost like a spice to point up the flavors of hot,  savory lamb and cool greenery.  </P> <P> One evening's supplementary menu offered a ravishingly beautiful arrangement of  braised rabbit livers and asparagus that was almost as beguiling to consume as  to regard. The livers crowned a fleur-de-lis arrangement of all the things that  rabbits like to nibble, including match-stick cuts of crisp apple, chopped  tomato, leaves of Belgian endive and a lush bouquet of adroitly cooked  asparagus. The livers, cooked very rare and served chilled from the  refrigerator, would have been better at room temperature and superb served hot  from the pan, with a bit of vinegar added to the cooking juices, but even as  they were, this was quite a dish.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Elegant and Unusual Soups  </P> <P> The standing menu offers two elegant and unusual soups. A deep, murky taste  underlies the roasted eggplant soup, a thick, suave puree that is "painted"  with bands of pureed herbs and centered with a crouton spread with a piquant  chopped olive mixture. The green gazpacho excludes tomato and is cool, creamy  and redolent of cucumbers and herbs -- the sort of variation on a theme that  overshadows the original.  </P> <P> Special entrees have included such offerings as sea bass with green lentils  (not common hereabouts) and rosemary, and a grilled, marinated rabbit served on  a crisp wild rice galette, or sauteed cake. A grilled veal chop garnished with  a compote of ginger and lemon was less demure than such chops can be, and  likable.  </P> <P> Only two desserts were sampled, and neither was notable. The creamy rice  pudding in strawberry sauce was nice in its way, but needed a little spark of  something to bring it up -- a sprinkle of cinnamon might have done the trick. A  lemon tart featured a vividly flavored filling, but offered it in a tough  crust.  </P></p>

			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: Pubs group to refinance Pounds 250m of bank debt INNTREPRENEUR Estates, the joint venture company set up by Grand Metropolitan and Courage in 1990, is planning to refinance Pounds 250m bank debt with a 20-year bond issue. Proposals for the secured debenture issue, arranged by NatWest Capital Markets, were presented to UK institutional investors in London and Edinburgh this week. The funds raised from the bond issue will be use to pay down a portion of almost Pounds 1.5bn raised from a syndicate of banks in 1991 for the acquisition of pubs. The main Pounds 1.325bn credit was syndicated among 20 banks, arranged by Citicorp, SG Warburg, Barclays and Natwest. The granting of security to bond holders has already been approved by the company's bank lenders. Bankers said yesterday that the reaction of institutional investors to the proposed deal was positive. However, Inntrepreneur is a unique credit and the structure of the deal will make direct comparison with outstanding bond issues difficult. The company holds around 7,000 pubs formerly owned by GrandMet and Courage, a subsidiary of Foster's of Australia. The joint venture was formed in response recommendations by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, which ruled that brewery companies should own only a limited number of pubs. Inntrepreneur leases the properties to landlords on 20-year leases, longer than usual in the licensed trade. The long contracts are designed to encourage lease-holders to invest cash in the business and upgrade the properties. If the value of the businesses increases, Inntrepreneur is able to charge higher rents and generate additional cash flow. The bonds will be secured on a pool of assets which broadly reflects Inntrepreneur's portfolio of properties. The pricing of the issue remains undecided. Pub operator Devenish this week placed Pounds 30m long-dated debentures secured on its estate of pubs at a yield 125 basis points more than long-dated gilts. However, the issue is far smaller and less liquid than the proposed Inntrepreneur transaction. The benchmark debenture issue in the sector, a Pounds 350m issue from Allied Lyons, trades at a spread of around 85 basis points. Bankers said yesterday the Inntrepreneur bonds were likely to be priced between these two levels.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Electric Union has announced that, next week,  the situation regarding the generation of electricity will  maintain the same pattern as last week, even though there could  be fewer outages this weekend with the reinsertion of other  generators that had been damaged or were under maintenance. The  Electric Union has also predicted a deficit of 630 megawatts,  which means that there will still be outages between the hours  of 0500 and 2400 local time.</p>

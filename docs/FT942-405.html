			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: UK housebuilders The latest shreds of evidence confirm that the UK housing market has come off the boil. Although mortgage lending by banks was higher in May than in April, the rise reflects market share taken from building societies, whose lending actually fell. Berkeley Group, the housebuilder which announced full-year results yesterday, has seen a notable slowing of sales this month. None of this points to another dangerous dip in house prices; selling prices still look likely to rise by 2-3 per cent this year. But such a modest increase will not allow housebuilders to pass through higher costs, especially the rising price of land. Since land prices have risen by about half from the trough last year, there could be a nasty squeeze on builders' margins to come. The snag for investors is knowing which of the quoted companies are likely to suffer most. Almost all took part in the feeding frenzy which saw Pounds 400m equity raised for investment in land. The only rule is that companies with large land stocks have been under less pressure to chase prices higher. The equity market has responded by marking down shares across the board. Having underperformed the market by about 20 per cent since March, most housebuilders now stand on price earnings multiples close to the market average. But it is difficult to argue that housebuilders are especially cheap. Canny companies should outperform their rivals as the distribution of pain becomes clear, but the sector is unlikely to flourish so long as the housing market remains lukewarm.</p>

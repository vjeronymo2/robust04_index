			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / Royal Mail flouts pay freeze with 3.4% offer Britain's postal workers have been offered a 2.8 per cent pay rise by the Post Office from November 1 which will rise to 3.4 per cent from January 1 in a clear breach of the government's three-year public-sector pay bill freeze. The Royal Mail described the deal yesterday as a 'reasonable settlement within the government's public-sector pay guidelines'. But the proposed wage settlement will add about Pounds 61m to the Post Office's current pay bill, a 2.7 per cent increase in a full year. The Union of Communication Workers is balloting its 160,000 members at the Post Office with a recommendation for them to accept the offer. The Post Office said it was made up of a 2.5 per cent increase on basic rates plus 0.3 per cent for past productivity improvements. A Pounds 1.50 a week supplement is to be consolidated into basic pay from January 1, adding a further 0.6 per cent to earnings. This will mean a total pensionable pay rise of 3.4 per cent for postmen and women. Mr Alan Johnson, the union's general secretary, said in a letter sent to his union's officers yesterday that the offer was 'by far the best negotiated settlement in the public sector' achieved by any group of workers this year and 'as far as the Royal Mail deals are concerned, it is the biggest increase over inflation in recent years'. Mr Chris Trinder, head of the independent Public Policy Foundation, said: 'It looks as though the government has turned a blind eye to their own pay guidelines in letting this offer through. Ministers appear to have drawn a lesson from the rail signalworkers' dispute and decided not to interfere.' The proposed pay deal does not exclude any further increases that the union UCW might be able to negotiate with the Post Office over productivity improvements in the period to next October, when the current agreement will end. Mr Johnson has told his officials: 'There are no strings or conditions attached and acceptance of this deal will allow both sides to return to the negotiating table to discuss the union's separate claim on hours of work, job security and productivity.' Last week firefighters were awarded a 2.2 per cent pay rise in line with their wage formula, index-linked to the upper quartile of male manual earnings. The police have received at least 3 per cent under their wage formula while the civil service has had increases of less than 2 per cent. Bank of England staff have secured increases of between 7 per cent and 8 per cent but these have all been self-financing.</p>

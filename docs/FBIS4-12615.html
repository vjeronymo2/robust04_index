			<p>BFN     [Text] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, Palestinian President Yasir  'Arafat's adviser, made a statement to reporters today before  the negotiations began in Cairo accusing the Israelis of wasting  time by discussing the details of the withdrawal from Gaza and  Jericho and the implementation of the limited Palestinian  autonomy there.    He added that by constantly placing impediments before the  Palestinian negotiators, the Israelis are making it impossible  to sign the agreement on 13 April, the deadline set by the  Palestinian- Israeli Declaration of Principles.</p>

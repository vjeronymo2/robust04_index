			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Owls command presidential attention - The Pacific Northwest ecological debate and the future of US logging It takes something out of the ordinary to get the US president, his vice-president, five members of his Cabinet and a double fistful of other senior officials to fly 3,000 miles across country from Washington to Portland, Oregon, to sit in a room talking and listening for six hours. The lure is America's oldest forests - and what inhabits them, including the now notorious and endangered Northern Spotted Owl - and today's Forest Conference, to be chaired by Mr Bill Clinton, is much more than the redemption of a campaign promise. It presages a substantial revolution in the way the federal government manages the lands under its charge, above all with respect to the balance between economic development and environmental protection. More narrowly, in the Pacific Northwest, it is the beginning of preparation for the time when there is even less prime timber to be cut and for the need to preserve a viable salmon fishing industry. The model for today's session is last December's Little Rock 'economic summit' when the then president-elect held court for two days debating with all and sundry about what ought to be done to set the economy right. This time, however, only locals have been invited to take part, appropriately, because there has been no more heated and divisive regional issue. The trees versus owls 'train wreck' - as Mr Bruce Babbitt, the interior secretary, calls it - is a four-year long drama that reached its twin peaks in 1990, when the spotted owl was officially declared an endangered species, and in 1991 when a federal judge in effect banned most logging on federal lands until the government came up with an acceptable plan to protect the bird. White House officials will not say precisely what they are contemplating, but there is no doubt that past pro-industry policies will be broken. As one member of the White House staff put it: 'In the Bush administration, there were five or six agencies each with a horse hitched to a different side of the cart. They couldn't figure out why the cart didn't go forward.' Environmentalists are confident that, with Vice-President Al Gore now on board, an ecologically friendly solution will be found. The timber industry broadly agrees, but fears for the consequences. Old growth forests, a national heritage in more ways than one, are those at least 200 years old. The majority are on federal lands, 90 per cent have already been logged, and an estimated 8m-9m acres now remain. About 30 per cent of national output occurs in public and private old growth forests and it is the highest quality timber. Not only are they the habitat of the spotted owl, but their ecosystems have helped sustain the region's important salmon fishing industry, employing 60,000 people a few years ago. Rivers and streams polluted by the timber industry have reduced regional income from commercial and sport fishing by 80 per cent over the last four years. Timber, still a Dollars 15bn a year industry, is less important than it was to the Pacific Northwest. In 1970, 10 per cent of regional employment was timber-related, but this is now closer to four per cent. There are roughly half the number of sawmills of 25 years ago. But some remote communities, with a distinctive way of life, are still almost exclusively dependent on the industry. In broad terms, the administration seems to be groping towards what might be called a 'timber conversion' plan not unlike that now being contemplated for the defence sector. This would permit some cutting in old growth forests, but much more stringent protection of their ecosystems and species, combined with financial assistance and retraining for displaced communities and workers. As with defence it will not be cheap and it will be controversial. There is some anecdotal evidence that both the environmentalists and the industry are now less entrenched in their positions, having tentatively reached the general conclusion that logging, like 19th century whaling in New England, is an occupation whose prime has past. But it will require all Mr Clinton's negotiating skills to find the right interim answers, however.</p>

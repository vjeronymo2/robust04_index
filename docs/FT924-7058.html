			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / International Company News: DoT signals approval to Northwest Airlines THE US Department of Transport has tentatively approved an essential legal condition to the proposed integration of services between KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, the Dutch flagship carrier, and Northwest Airlines, the fourth largest US airline. The DoT announced it was issuing a 'show-cause' order, seeking comment on why it should not approve a request from the two carriers to combine their operations and effectively function as a single carrier. The order sets a 21-day period for comments and replies, after which the DoT will issue its final decision. However, the US authorities made clear the agreement 'should benefit the public by providing better services and enabling the two carriers to operate more efficiently'. The DoT said it did not expect the agreement to reduce competition substantially, but it will still require the carriers to resubmit the arrangements for review in five years. KLM has held a minority stake in Northwest since a Dollars 3.65bn leveraged buy-out of the US carrier in 1989. However, the two airlines claim any significant integration of their respective business has been hampered by the need for immunity from prosecution under US anti-trust laws. Because US law prohibits a foreign carrier from owning a controlling interest in a US airline, the two airlines argue that there is 'a very real risk that collaborative planning, scheduling, pricing and marketing of services could be challenged as being price-fixing and market allocation agreements between horizontal competitors'. The request for anti-trust immunity came shortly after the US and Dutch governments signed an 'open skies' aviation pact, essentially allowing each others' carriers unfettered access to the respective home markets. The issue of operational integration arises at a delicate time for Northwest, when financial uncertainties are hanging over the company.</p>

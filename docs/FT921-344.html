			<p>920330 FT  30 MAR 92 / Letter: ICI breaks waste ranks Sir, I am sure that ICI will be delighted to learn that its hazardous waste generation has fallen to 475.9 tonnes world-wide in 1991 ('ICI emissions were cut by 3.7% last year', March 18). Unfortunately, your report is a factor of 1,000 too small. ICI has still achieved a 30 per cent reduction in hazardous waste generation, but from 677,900 to 475,900 tonnes. Similarly, off-site disposal of hazardous waste to landfill dropped from 160,100 tonnes to 151,300 tonnes, and so on. It is with some interest that I wait to see how other UK chemical companies and manufacturers respond to this 'breaking of ranks' by ICI. The view that such information is either impossible to collate, or is commercially sensitive, has effectively been put to rest by the efforts of ICI group environmental adviser, John Coleman, and his team.

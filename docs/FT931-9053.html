			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: EC banana curb sparks German court threat OUTRAGED GERMAN banana importers yesterday said they would appeal to the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg against the European Community decision to restrict Latin American imports. The German importers said the new EC regime, agreed in the early hours of Saturday, would kill 50 per cent of their business and make bananas sold in Germany 30 per cent more expensive. They said they would turn to the European Court of Justice as well as to national courts within the community and would encourage Latin American countries to challenge the issue within the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Banana importers in Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Belgium, are also expected to turn to the European court of justice. In Bonn, Mr Otto Lambsdorff, leader of the coalition member Free Democrats, called the EC regime 'an unbelievable piece of protectionism'. A government official said the matter would be looked into the coming days. Meanwhile, Mr Eduard Lintner, the German government's top anti-drug official, told a local paper the move would boost cocaine importers and deal a 'catastrophic' blow to the anti-drug fight in Europe. EC farm ministers agreed in the early hours of Saturday that imports of bananas from Latin America, the so-called dollar bananas, should be restricted to 2m tonnes a year at a tariff of a Ecu100 (Pounds 82) a tonne. Imports above that limit will be charged at the rate of Ecu850 a tonne. The new regime aims to protect higher-cost producers in territories with close links to EC member states, such as former colonies. Local papers echoed the outcry of producers when readers woke up yesterday to articles denouncing 'the crooked thing about the banana'. Germans are especially fond of the cheap fruit, consuming more of it than any fellow Europeans. Of the 3.6m tonnes of bananas imported into the EC last year, 2.7m tonnes came from Latin American countries, and these were nearly entirely sold in Germany. The banana became a symbol of reunification as eastern Germans were handed the fruit by their western countrymen after the Berlin Wall had been torn down. Eastern German per capita consumption is 28 kg a year, compared with 18 kg in the western part.</p>

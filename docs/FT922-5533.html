			<p>920530 FT  30 MAY 92 / Letter: Government commitment to London's transport Sir, Your article on the comparison of transport conditions in London and Paris ('France accelerates into the overtaking lane', May 29), based on a joint report by two research organisations, well illustrates a point made in the report itself. It points out that British commentators tend to be generally critical of the present state of the capital's transport policy and infrastructure, whereas in Paris 'by stark contrast, the regional authorities seem to be more concerned with advertising what they consider to be their achievements and future potentials'. True to form you ignore all the positive things to be said about the situation in London. For example, over the past five years investment in rail infrastructure and rolling stock serving London has more than doubled, from Pounds 420m in 1986-87 to Pounds 948m in 1990-91 (at 1990-91 prices) - much higher than the FFrs5,517m in Paris in 1989 - and is set to increase further over the next three years. London Underground plans to invest more than Pounds 3.5bn over this period. London and Paris are very different cities and their transport systems have developed differently. Whereas the Metro serves the whole of central Paris, London south of the Thames is mainly served by Network South East. Taking both systems together there is very little difference in the coverage of the inner area. As the report points out, London has much better rail coverage both in the outer areas and the surrounding region. Traffic conditions are actually better in central London than in central Paris in the peak hours because of the greater density of development in Paris, and a deliberate policy of traffic restraint in London, including restrictive parking. Nobody denies that governments of both persuasions under-invested in our infrastructure in the past, but our investment plans are an earnest of this government's commitment to providing London with a modern and efficient transport system for the next century. The creation of a minister with sole responsibility for transport in London underlines the political will to ensure this will be achieved.

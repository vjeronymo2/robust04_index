			<p><P> May 10, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MCA SAYS IT MAY SELL SPENCER GIFTS UNIT  </P> <P> MCA Inc. is considering selling its slumping gift store and catalogue unit,  Spencer Gifts, and will make a decision later this year, Chairman Lew R.  Wasserman disclosed Wednesday at the entertainment giant's annual meeting in  Chicago.  </P> <P> Responding to a question about the firm's plans for the unit, Wasserman noted  that retail sales are weak nationally. He did not elaborate.  </P> <P> Spencer Gifts has a mail-order catalogue business and operates retail gift  stores, jewelry stores and kiosks across the country. Earnings of MCA's retail  and mail-order division declined to $403,000 last year, from $9.5 million in  1987 and $115.5 million in 1986.  </P> <P> Separately, Wasserman said MCA had been "successful" in its effort to keep the  management of Cineplex Odeon Corp. from buying control of the Canadian-based  theater operator. MCA, the largest shareholder of the concern with a 49% stake,  resisted the bid by Cineplex Odeon Chairman Garth H. Drabinsky to buy 30% of  company shares from the Bronfman family.  </P> <P> Wasserman turned aside questions on news reports that MCA may go private or be  sold. "We are constantly examining what is in the best interests of all  shareholders."  </P> <P> Shareholders defeated a proposal to have the company cease doing business in  South Africa. The proposal was beaten by a margin of 73% to 8%, with 19%  abstaining.  </P> <P> The advocates of the proposal were the Adrian Dominican Sisters and Christian  Brothers Investment Services Inc., who together hold 60,500 shares of MCA  stock.  </P> <P> Sid Sheinberg, MCA president and chief operating officer, said the company  considers the issue a matter of freedom of speech. He cited the example of the  Universal International Pictures film, "Cry Freedom," about the life of South  African black activist Steve Biko.  </P> <P> "We don't see this as analogous to companies that sell products . . . . We see  it as analogous to our freedom of speech," he said.  </P> <P> Sheinberg said MCA would consider using profits from its South African  operations to fight apartheid there.  </P></p>

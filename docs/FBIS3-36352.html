			<p>Language: <F P=105> Latvian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] [Announcer] State President Guntis Ulmanis and Prime  Minister Valdis Birkavs today sent a letter to NATO concerning  Latvia's wish to join the Partnership for Peace program.    At a news conference Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs stressed  that joining this program is one more step in implementing the  number one priority of the state -- security policy. The  security and defense policy is currently being implemented in  Latvia in three main aspects.    [Begin Birkavs recording] One is the budget intended for  defense and security structures. Compared with the past year,  it has been increased by 57 percent; obviously it is not enough.    The second step in that direction is the talks that we have  begun to also use credits for strengthening our armament. We  need international guarantees. We have to interweave into the  European context with all our structures. And the Partnership  for Peace, this initiative, is the one that gives us new  opportunities. But I would like to say that that is not a  security market, on which everyone buys his security, but rather  that it is an opportunity for a state to achieve gradual  approach to NATO structures in talks with NATO. That is a  vehicle that will allow us in the event of a crisis to obtain  consultations and thus react correctly to specific crises. This  will require a great deal of strength, this will also require  additional funds, but this has to be done, because otherwise we  may lose all that we have achieved.    According to the Partnership for Peace, each state can set  up  its own communication bureau in Brussels with NATO Headquarters.  So then, I consider that we will need a person who would be  specifically oriented toward cooperation with NATO so that we  can actively participate in the creation of the NATO partnership.    The 14th clause of the declaration, Partnership for Peace,  reads: NATO will provide consultations for each active  participant in the partnership in the event that they feel  direct threats to their territorial integrity, political  sovereignty, or security.    So then, a simple passive statement will not be enough and  we  are oriented toward active participation in this process. [end  recording]    [Announcer] It is envisaged that Prime Minister Valdis  Birkavs will sign a document on Latvia joining the Partnership  for Peace program in Brussels as early as next week.</p>

			<p>941205 FT  05 DEC 94 / Germans and British hold similar views on European Union: One third support local council power - Both countries find US most reliable ally / Single currency widely opposed In the Euro-enthusiasm rankings, Britain and Germany usually appear at different ends of the league table. Germany traditionally embodies a commitment to deepening and widening European integration, while Britain is well known for its scepticism. The customary view of the breadth of the Euro-gulf between the two countries was put baldly by a German minister earlier this year: 'We want a united Europe. All you (the British) want is a free trade zone.' In fact, as one of the most comprehensive polls ever undertaken on the subject shows, the views of the British and German electorates on the future of Europe are closer than such statements suggest. Although Germans are much happier with the present position of their country and their regions within the European Union, they are even more sceptical than the British about intensifying political and monetary ties with existing EU partners. They have also grown reluctant about widening the EU towards the east. There is a similar desire in both countries for decisions to be taken as much as possible at the local level, in line with the principle of subsidiarity that the EU has been trying to foster. A third of respondents in Britain and Germany say decisions affecting ordinary people should be carried out by local government or councils. However, this wish is much more difficult to put into practice in Britain because of the weakness of local and regional governments. Both countries think the US is more reliable than their European partners, with two-fifths of respondents naming Washington as their nation's strongest ally. The Germans view France far more favourably than Britain. More surprisingly, a relatively large percentage of Britons above the age of 60 - some 8 per cent - sees Germany as Britain's strongest ally. Eastern Germans show above-average reliance on the US and are even less inclined than west Germans to point to Russia as an ally. In attitudes towards Europe, there are large disparities according to age, social background and region in both Britain and Germany. Broadly speaking, in both countries young higher-income males are most in favour of EU membership, while women take a more sceptical line. Conservative voters in Germany are more positive about the EU than those on the left, while in Britain Labour supporters are slightly more inclined to call EU membership 'a good thing'. Younger British people are much more in favour of increasing powers for the European parliament and building up EU political ties than are older voters. The generation gap on such points is less marked in Germany. In Britain many more older people than younger ones say their region is worse off as a result of the EU, while in Germany, the opposite is true: older people are more favourable to membership than those under 30. Support for the Ecu as a possible name for a future European currency is strongest among higher-income voters with better educational backgrounds in both Germany and Britain. Britons are much more gloomy than Germans on the present economic impact of the EU. Although support for EU membership has declined significantly in both countries during the past few years, it has descended in Germany from a much higher base. In Britain, only one region - Scotland - out of 11 maintains, on balance, that it has benefited from EU membership. By contrast, in Germany six of the 10 regions say they are 'better off' as the result of the EU. In Germany, Rhineland-Palatinate, North Rhine-Westphalia, Hamburg and Berlin are most enthusiastic about regional benefits. Overall support for the EU is only slightly greater in western Germany than in the east, a sign that increases in Brussels funding for east Germany may be starting to improve pro-EU sentiment in the east. Some of the most negative attitudes on the EU's regional impact are found in areas of high unemployment such as Yorkshire and northern England, and Brandenburg and Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. However, relatively prosperous southern regions in both countries - London and south-east England, and Bavaria and Baden-Wurttemberg - also show negative reactions. There is a sharp contrast between Britain and Germany over the European parliament, with half of Britons opposed to giving it new powers to control the Commission, compared with only 12 per cent in Germany. On fundamental questions of the EU's future structure, however, the two countries are closer. Opposition to a single currency, a strong desire for a referendum on the issue, and lukewarm views on political union are put forward consistently by all categories of respondents in different regions in the two countries. Lowest support for a single currency comes from southern regions of both Britain and Germany, with eastern Germany more reticent than the west. Strongest support for a referendum comes from the state of Hesse - the home of the German Bundesbank. German eagerness to forge closer links with eastern Europe may be cooling as a result of economic pressure. East German states are only slightly more keen on enlarging the EU eastwards than the generally sceptical west Germans; in previous opinion polls the east Germans had been much more in favour. Supporters of the Christian Democratic Union are least enthusiastic about enlargement. The German states with the strongest desire for enlargement - Rhineland-Palatinate and Saarland, close to the French border - are furthest away from the east. In Britain, Scotland and south-west England are most in favour of eastward enlargement, with other southern areas much less keen. When scores are combined on a range of issues linking feelings about the EU's present impact to views about its future, Rhineland-Palatinate has by far the highest 'Euro-comfort' index of the two countries. Only one British region - Scotland - has a positive score, compared with nine in Germany. The population in the newcomer east German states seems much less ignorant about the EU than much of Britain. In Brandenburg an above-average 57 per cent answered correctly that Brussels is the site of the European Commission. The east Midlands takes the prize as the worst-informed region, with only 38 per cent of respondents replying correctly. The most knowledgeable areas seem to be North Rhine-Westphalia and south-west England, where 64 per cent of respondents correctly identified Brussels.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- What Britons and Germans think of Europe  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Which regions say they are better or worse off as a result of EU membership Numbers indicate difference between 'better off' and 'worse off' Britain                            Germany Scotland                    2      Schleswig-Holsten, Hamburg       12 North-west                -15      Bremen, Lower Saxony            -13 West Midlands              -9      North Rhine-Westphalia            9 Wales                     -18      Saarland, Rhineland-Palatinate   29 South-west                -26      Baden-Wuttemberg                 -4 North                     -23      Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Yorkshire &amp; Humberside    -21      Brandenburg                     -10 East Midlands              -4      Berlin                            8 East Anglia                -7      Saxony-Anhalt, Saxony, South-east                -16      Thuringia                         4 London                    -12      Hesse                             6                                    Bavaria                          -5  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Is your region better or worse off as a result of your country's membership of the European Union?

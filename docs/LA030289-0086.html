			<p><P> March 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> House Speaker Jim Wright (D-Tex.) angrily denied a report that he once  threatened to expose a federal bank regulator as a homosexual in order to  promote the interests of Texas savings and loan officials. "The story . . . is  preposterous," Wright told reporters, referring to an article in the Washington  Times that said such an allegation was being reviewed by the House Ethics  Committee as it concludes its investigation of Wright. Wright is charged with  bringing extraordinary pressure on the Federal Home Loan Bank Board to be more  lenient with financially troubled Texas thrifts and allow them to plead their  cases directly to top officials in Washington. The Washington Times said the  allegation accused him of threatening federal officials in Washington with  "blowing the whistle" on a Texas regulator's homosexuality unless the S&amp;L  executives were allowed to circumvent that level with their pleas.  </P></p>

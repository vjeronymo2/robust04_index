			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / International Company News: Japanese seek US funds JAPANESE manufacturers such as Nissan, the automotive maker, Kobe Steel and Kawasaki Steel, are increasing fund procurement through US securitisation agencies. With the current stock market slump preventing fund-raising through equity, companies are keen to pursue alternative measures. They are also under increasing pressure to collect receivable credits, as the slowing economy is affecting cash flow. Securitisation of sales credits is restrained in the domestic financial markets, as securitisation agencies are not permitted. The Securities and Exchange Act, the Japanese version of the US Glass Steagall Act, also defines repackaged assets as certificates, preventing the instruments from being traded as securities.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Declaration by the Yemeni Political Forces Dialogue </F> Committee, read by Ahmad Jabir 'Afif, Dialogue Committee  rapporteur, at the signing of the Yemeni document of pledge and  accord on 20 February at the Royal Hashemite Court in Amman --  live]    [Text] In the name of God, the merciful, the  compassionate. We, the signers of the pledge and accord  document, thank God for having helped our people, represented by  political forces in and out of power, to choose the correct way  to complete the accord document through democratic, serious, and  responsible dialogue with a view to putting a definitive end to  the crisis, reinforcing unity, democracy, and stabilizing the  state of law and order and institutions as a practcial way to  achieve devleopment and contribute to the civilized Arabic and  Islamic agenda.    The signing of the pledge and accord document in Amman, the  capital of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, will put a  definitive end to all complications. It will expedite the end  of the crisis. It will slice through the roots of the crisis and  contribute much to the implementation of the contents of the  document, so as to restore security and stability to the dear  Yemeni homeland.    By signing the pledge and accord document in brotherly  Jordan, we have added faith to our Yemeni document, confirming  the nation's ability to take the initiative to resolve national  problems and crises, restablish close Arab links, and revive  hope in an era of division that has intensified to the point of  enmity between brother and brother.    We, the Yemenis, have suffered from much political trouble  in  our contemporary history. The result is an unshakable faith in  unity as the answer and the way to build our modern state on  foundations of democracy, social justice, equality, and human  rights. Unity is a historic step on the road to our  comprehensive Arab and Islamic unity. Local, Arab, and world  conditions that coincided with the establishment of our unity  not only had a negative impact on our unionist, democratic  project, but included all the remnants of the division era --  remnants that were not taken into account during and after the  Gulf war. As a result, our steps in our drive to build the new  modern state have faltered. We should have been working hard to  firm up the foundation of unity and to reinforce its democratic  course, to open the door to the prosperity of the homeland and  the well-being of the people.    Our people have proved to the world that they have enough  strength and wisdom to ride out the crises that obstruct their  march, subordinating impulse to reason and narrow interests to  the call of conscience.    Our people have borne numerous difficulties. Much negativism  has affected various aspects of their lives. Yet, the historic  experience of Yemen proves that the will of the people has  triumphed. Only democratic dialogue will be able to realize the  unity and stability of the homeland and survive crises, no  matter how delicate or complex the situation may be. Only  through democratic and peaceful dialogue can we start on the  correct road out of the crisis and toward serious action to  attain all that our people and brothers and friends around the  world want.    We emphasize that Yemen will remain united, now that we have  worked out its present and future outlines and laid the  foundations for its stability and advancement and affluence,  drawing succor and success from God and resolve and  steadfastness from our people.    In these awesome and historic moments, we declare our  determination to abide by the accord document and the sincere  commitment of our political parties and organizations to turn it  into a practical program for our new march as one team. We will  confront anyone who tries to block its implementation. We will  abide by all guarantees and implement everything we agreed on,  in accordance with the timetables specified in the document.    We would like to emphasize that the progress and well-being  of peoples are contingent upon the strength of institutions and  the principles and the clarity of vision and methods. We hereby  promise our great Yemeni people to make the Dialogue Commitee,  the political parties and organizations, along with all  well-meaning Yemenis, a potent force to advance the  implementation of the pledge and accord document.    On this occasion and in this favored month, we take the  opportunity to extend our deep thanks to His Majesty King Husayn  of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan and to the Jordanian  government and people for their distinguished efforts on behalf  of Yemen's unity. We thank them for their sponsorship of this  blessed, historic meeting. We thank those who have expressed  their concern and exerted themselves so we, the Yemenis, might  come safely through the crisis. Our thanks go to all those who  have shared our accord signing ceremonies.    In conclusion, we thank our patient Yemeni people for their  patience and endurance and for helping us lift ourselves from  the crisis in the homeland and the people. We congratulate our  Arab and Islamic nation on the occasion of the blessed month of  Ramadan. We ask God that next year's Ramadan will see us all  enjoying the fruits of security and stability. We thank God and  seek his succor and help.</p>

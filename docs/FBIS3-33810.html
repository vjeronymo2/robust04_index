Hashid tribesmen surrounding Madan village, 200 kilometers  (120 miles) northwest of the capital Sanaa, blocked all access  routes to force the surrender of the kidnappers, from the rival  Ahnum tribe.    Last Sunday Ahnum tribesmen seized Henri Heslot and his  wife,  both retired agriculture professors, as well as cardiologist  Brigitte Fontaine, 42, to press the government into diverting a  road through their region.    A Yemeni interior ministry source told AFP on Saturday the  ministry was negotiating for the hostages' release, and they  were being "treated like guests and their security is not in  danger."    Shaykh 'Abdallah al-Ahmar, chief of the Hashid, had also  sent  an envoy to the village, sources said.    Al-Ahmar, who is Yemen's parliamentary speaker, heads the  Islamic al-Islah Party, which is part of the government  coalition.    Negotiators said Sunday the Ahnum tribesmen had vowed they  would "not surrender, even if we all have to die."    Other sources reported divisions among the Ahnum over the  kidnapping of women and elderly people, considered contrary to  the tribe's "code of honour."    The three were abducted while on a tour organized by Club  Aventure (Adventure Club), company director Yves Godeau said in  Paris.    The Ahnum were demanding that a road be built bypassing  Hashid land, so that their goods could be delivered to other  parts of the country safely, officials said.    However, the powerful Hashid tribes, whose land surrounds  the  Ahnum, had altered the direction of the road.    In Paris, the French Foreign Ministry said the French  Embassy  in Sanaa had asked the authorities to try to obtain the  hostages' immediate release and said the three were in "good  health and well treated."    Yemeni sources added that the tourists were being kept in a  house with electricity and warm water and were able to read  newspapers and books which a tribal leader had passed on to them  from the French Embassy.    In the past few months tribesmen have repeatedly kidnapped  foreigners, including Western oil workers, to put pressure on  the Yemeni government.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>   [Excerpts] In the wake of the recent baseless accusations  raised by the British mass media concerning the Islamic Republic  of Iran's material and moral support for the Irish Republican  Army, the IRA, and implicit conformation of these baseless  allegations by some British officials, once again Tehran-London  relations have been pushed to the brink of a difficult political  crisis. Resolution of this crisis is not predictable owing to  British leaders' lack of political independence. [passage  omitted]    From the viewpoint of domestic and foreign experts the  critical situation prevalent in Britain is closely linked with  London's fresh charge against the Islamic Republic of Iran. It  is also construed as a preplanned political and propaganda  offensive in order to divert the attention of the people of  Britain from the failures suffered by its Conservative  government in its domestic and foreign policies. [passage  omitted]    Albert Reynolds, the president of the Irish Republic, too,  in  implicitly dismissing the British Government claim on alleged  cooperation between the Islamic Republic of Iran and the IRA,  has pointed out that so far no firm documents or evidence have  been presented to him concerning such cooperation.    This statement of the Irish president, and also a clear-cut  assertion by the Irish Foreign Ministry spokesman to the effect  that Ireland is continuing its efforts to boost economic ties  and also a current trend on understanding and exchange between  Tehran and Dublin and that Ireland is not inclined at all to  undermine this reciprocal understanding, all point to just one  thing. They show the reality that British statesmen have failed  in a new round of their efforts to pressure Iran. Hence they  must, once again, face the undesirable result of their  counselling with the U.S. policies against the Islamic  revolution.    In a reference to the U.S. Administration's reaction to  Britain's baseless claim on Iran's alleged cooperation with the  IRA would clearly show the collusion between Washington and  London. [sentence as heard] Last week, or few days before the  start of this fresh clamor by the government of John Major, U.S.  Secretary of State Warren Christopher paid a visit to London,  and when this political and propaganda offensive was initiated  by Britain against Iran the head of the U.S. diplomacy was in  Cairo. While in the Egyptian capital, Christopher, just moments  after the assertion of this British claim against Iran, and even  quicker than the procedure prevalent in diplomatic norms, said  the issue shows that Iran must remain isolated and not get any  share of economic aid from the West. This posturing was very  controversial in the opinion of many analysts and experts in  political affairs. It added to the notion that Christopher,  prior to the start of this abortive offensive, had been briefed  on the matter in the course of his British visit and had already  made the necessary coordinations with the British leaders.  [passage omitted] At any rate, in respect of the fact that the  recent British claim against Iran points to London's political  defeat in Northern Ireland, it also brings to memory yet another  reality. Britain under the U.S. pressure has repeatedly acted  against the Islamic Republic of Iran, and on each occasion has  experienced the unfavorable outcome of this conflict more than  any other country. Undoubtedly, this time too, it will gain  nothing.    Early last autumn Douglas Hurd, British foreign secretary,  prior to meeting with Iran's foreign minister, Dr. 'Ali Akbar  Velayati, on the sidelines of the 48th UN General Assembly  session had said: The agenda of my talks with Dr. Velayati will  be difficult. Now, apparently, Mr. Hurd should respond to this  question as to why the agenda of talks between Tehran and other  political representatives of European capitals has never been  that difficult. The response is quite evident. In the event,  British statesmen, while disregarding the U.S. pressures,  reassess their stands concerning bilateral ties and view the  existing issues realistically. They will not find any major  obstacle on the way of the expansion of Tehran-London relations.  If this does not happen, then the vicious circle will continue  indefinitely.</p>

			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / Councils criticised over planning MOST councils are failing to meet government targets for faster planning decisions in spite of a fall in development activity, the Audit Commission says in a report published today. The government spending watchdog says only a handful of English councils are satisfying the target of deciding 80 per cent of planning applications within eight weeks. The target was set in 1982 by Mr Michael Heseltine, then environment secretary. The commission says the proportion of applications decided within eight weeks declined from 70 per cent in 1982-83 to 46 per cent in 1989-90. It adds that there has been only a small improvement since 1989-90 in spite of a fall in applications and a rise in staff. The commission says councils should take advantage of lower workloads to streamline and improve their planning procedures. The report was welcomed yesterday by the Conservative-led Association of District Councils; the Association of London Authorities, which represents most Labour London boroughs; and the Council for the Protection of Rural England (CPRE), the environmental group. Mr Tony Burton, senior planner at the CPRE, warned, however, that 'proper protection for the countryside cannot be secured by rushed planning decisions to meet artificial deadlines imposed by the government'. During 1990-91, English local authorities made decisions on 518,000 planning applications compared with more than 600,000 applications in each of the two preceding years. Applications last year, however, were still 40 per cent higher than 10 years before. Mr Bob Chilton, local government director at the commission, said: 'Having survived the pressures of the development boom of the late 1980s, local authorities should use the current easing in the volume of applications to assess the quality of the local service they provide and to prepare for the next surge in applications.' The commission said that time wasted in administration could be put to better use in improving assessment procedures and providing greater public consultation. It urged planning departments to avoid wasting time by setting clear objectives and providing opportunities for discussion and advice before developers submitted formal applications.

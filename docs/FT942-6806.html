			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / Spanish pay rises low Spain's escalating labour costs are being sharply reduced as unions settle for below-inflation salary increases in the 1994 round of collective wage agreements. An annual pay increase over the next two years of 2.75 per cent covering 150,000 bank employees, which was signed yesterday, followed an agreement with unions for a 2.5 per cent wage rise in the construction industry. Year-on-year headline inflation is currently 4.9 per cent and is expected to fall to 3.5-4 per cent by the end of this year. Mr Ignacio Montejo, chief economist at Madrid brokers FG, forecasts that average wage increases through Spain this year will be within the 2-3 per cent range and that unit labour costs will rise by 1.5 per cent against an increase of 3 per cent in 1993. For most of the past decade Spain's unit labour costs rose between 5 and 8 per cent a year.</p>

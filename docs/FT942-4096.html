			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Welsh Water to launch cost savings scheme Welsh Water is believed to be considering a substantial cost-cutting programme to be announced after July 28, when it will be allowed to reveal price increases set by the industry regulator for the next five years. The group is thought to be examining proposed voluntary job cuts of 10 to 15 per cent in the core utility division. This employs roughly 3,000 people. The water sector as a whole is expected to come under increasing pressure for cost savings as part of the current price review. Anglian Water recently announced plans to cut 900 jobs - or 17 per cent of its utility workforce over the next two years. Welsh's record on cost-cutting so far had been solid if undynamic, said one analyst. 'They would want to announce further controllable cost savings of at least 10 and possibly 15 per cent as early as possible following the results of the review,' he said. The speculation followed Welsh's announcement of a 7 per cent drop in pre-tax profits to Pounds 144.2m for the year ended March 31, on turnover 34 per cent ahead to Pounds 512.1m. Profits had been hit by a Pounds 7.5m loss on discontinued operations and a swing from a Pounds 9m interest gain to a charge of Pounds 2.6m. At the operating level, Welsh increased profits by 16 per cent - including the hit on discontinued businesses - to Pounds 146.4m. The utility increased operating profits by 12 per cent to Pounds 148.8m. Mr Graham Hawker, chief executive, said measured consumption had held up well. Operating costs had increased by 3 per cent. Welsh said that 1993-94 had been a year of restructuring for the unregulated businesses. The lossmaking pipeline maintenance business had been closed, and the company said it expected the Pounds 7.5m exceptional charge to cover all costs. Acer, the engineering consultant acquired in February 1993, had reduced costs and been refocused on its main markets. While this had disrupted business, order books remained strong. Acer contributed operating profits of Pounds 5.1m on sales of Pounds 130m for the year. The final dividend was raised by 8 per cent to 8.45p, for a similarly increased total payout of 25.4p (23.5p). Earnings were 14 per cent lower at 89.2p (104p). COMMENT Welsh remains one of the financially strongest of water companies with net cash of Pounds 55m. While expected to breach the gearing barrier by the end of this year, it is still likely to stay at the top of the financial league. Dividend cover is not expected to fall much lower than 3.5 times. There are still small questions over Acer, however, which is not expected to move forward this year. In the end, everything now hangs on the current price review. If it gets even a zero increase, this would be good news. Forecasts are for Pounds 155m, with a further 8 per cent dividend increase to 27.5p.</p>

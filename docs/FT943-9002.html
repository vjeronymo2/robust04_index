			<p>940813 FT  13 AUG 94 / Finance and the Family: The endowment trap - Surrender and lose Cashing in an endowment mortgage within the first five years is likely to lose you far more money than paying off a repayment mortgage early. But endowments remain the best-selling type, mainly because commission-based advisers make more from them. Endowments comprise an interest-only loan and a stock market-linked savings plan, with life insurance thrown in. If the savings plan grows in line with expectations, it should pay off the capital sum at the end of the term; any amount remaining can be taken as a tax-free lump sum. The borrower's monthly payments are made up of the interest payable to the lender and premiums to the life office. Banks and building societies are paid commission for selling endowments but not for the repayment type, which does not have a life insurance element. Monthly instalments on a repayment mortgage cover interest and capital. The Office of Fair Trading is expected to publish figures this autumn showing that, if an endowment is surrendered at the end of the first year, anyone paying Pounds 100 a month for a policy (equating roughly to a mortgage of just over Pounds 80,000) would, on average, be Pounds 600-Pounds 800 worse off than if they had taken out a repayment mortgage. If the surrender occurred at the end of the fifth year, then the relative disadvantage would be Pounds 1,600-Pounds 1,800 on average. In the worst cases, the disadvantage can be twice the average. The main problem is surrender values. An OFT report in June found wide disparities in the surrender values of life insurance policies after surveying 60 of the UK's largest life insurers, and our table bears this out. In all three cases, cashing in the repayment mortgage is a cheaper option than an endowment. You would, however, be far worse off with an endowment mortgage from Allied Dunbar, if you redeemed it within five years, than from the other lenders. This is because Allied Dunbar pays nothing for surrender in the first five years, even though the customer would have paid in premiums of Pounds 4,266 by the end of the fifth year. Allied Dunbar says: 'Our adaptable endowment plan is only offered to cover mortgages where there is a client need for the product to be sustained to cover the mortgage over its full period.' Early surrender values are of particular concern to consumer groups. Although an endowment mortgage ideally should be regarded as a long-term savings plan, many people do surrender early. According to the OFT, figures from one lender suggest about one-third of endowment policies are surrendered in the first four to five years. If you want to repay your mortgage early, it is a better idea to pay off the capital but keep the endowment going as a separate savings plan. Repayment mortgages have drawbacks, too. In the early years, for instance, you pay more in interest than reducing capital. And, if you move often, you will find you make little headway on paying off the capital.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- How do they compare?

The interest rate shown and the calculation for the repayment total cost line are based on a mortgage rate of 7.64 per cent.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / Arts: Great clash of egos IMAGINE THIS: Napoleon holed up in an Italian taverna with Ellen Terry. Shaw did, and the fantasy supplied the third of his plays pleasant, The Man of Destiny. Now imagine Napoleon holed up in an Italian taverna with Kate O'Mara, and you have the measure of the Merriman Theatre Company's revival, which brings this new actors' ensemble Battersea's Latchmere Theatre for the second time. It would seem churlish, given the provenance of what Shaw himself dubbed a 'perfectly idiotic play', to moan that it was being treated as a vehicle. O'Mara makes a glamorous Strange Lady and shows a shapely pair of legs in male disguise, but does she have to grasp her bosoms every time pain or fear are mentioned? Looking down the cast list, the penny drops that there is no director to advise on the nuances of flirtation. Hence the absence of nuances. One can appreciate the appeal to actors of collective direction, but for the audience the result is too often a cacophony of egos. Shaw holds his own better than most - indeed, after ploughing his pompous and detailed introductory exposition on the political merits of Napoleon, one is left in little doubt about whose ego is the biggest. The comedy itself is a little something he rushed off in 1896 on the subject of courage, class and colonialism, with a nice part thrown in for his favourite actress. It takes place in an Italian inn, where Napoleon is holed up awaiting despatches containing intelligence about the next stage in his offensive against the Austrians. They saucily turn up in the bodice of a lady traveller who, in male disguise, tricked them out of his bonehead of a lieutenant. The rest is a game of hide and seek, with bouts of buffoonery and one vintage piece of Shavian oratory when the young Corsican general, zealously played by Richard Willis, becomes a mouthpiece for an Irish radical's view of the English. Nicholas Blane's blubbery, Italianate inn-keeper and Robert Richmond's lip-licking military twit are cliches held on fitfully amusing monotone. Not much subtlety is asked for, and no subtlety is offered.</p>

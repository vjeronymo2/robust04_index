			<p>BFN     [Text] President Itamar Franco today congratulated the  military officers promoted to general on 31 March. In his speech  to the generals, President Itamar Franco mentioned the general  elections that will be held this year and the need to guarantee  that the process take place in perfect democratic order:    [Begin Franco recording] We are getting close to a decision  by the people who will elect their governors. As citizens, we  have our candidates, parties, and ideas. In our condition as  citizens, we will, as is our duty, struggle for the triumph of  the candidates chosen by our conscience. As servants of society  it is our responsibility to guarantee the freedom of the voters  and the transmission of power within a strict democratic order.  [end recording]    President Itamar Franco also pointed out the Armed Forces'  cooperation with the government and its understanding in the  face of difficult situations:    [Begin Franco recording] When I step down from power I will  remember from these difficult months the good relationship with  the Armed Forces, in whom I have always found understanding for  the sacrifice that the budget restrictions have imposed on us,  as well as its limitless contribution to the success of this  administration, which, despite the bad will of many people,  cannot be denied. We managed to resume our economic development,  we are eliminating the public deficit, and effective measures  against inflation are being taken. Throughout this difficult  process we have always counted on the Armed Forces' men as part  of an institution and as high-ranking members of our  administration. [end recording]    President Franco also said that on 20 April he will send  Congress a provisional measure establishing the rehiring of the  public employees dismissed during the Collor administration.    The president added that he believes there will be a quorum  in Congress this week to vote on the URV [Real Value Unit]  Provisional Measure. The president said he relies on the good  sense of members of Congress. He considers the provisional  measure a decisive step in the struggle against the inflation.</p>

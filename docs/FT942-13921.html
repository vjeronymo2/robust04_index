			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / IBM beats profit forecasts International Business Machines reported higher than expected first quarter earnings on slightly increased revenues as costs declined more quickly than anticipated. First quarter net earnings were Dollars 392m (Pounds 263m), or 64 cents per share, compared with a net loss of Dollars 399m, or 70 cents, in the first quarter of 1993. Revenues rose 2 per cent to Dollars 13.4bn. IBM's shares were trading at Dollars 57 1/8 in mid-session yesterday, up from Dollars 52 1/4 . The first-quarter results represent IBM's second consecutive quarterly profit after three years of heavy losses. Revenues increased for the first time since the third quarter of 1992. 'Our first-quarter results were encouraging,' said Mr Lou Gerstner, chairman and chief executive. 'Revenues grew in all major regions of the world. Expenses declined significantly. However, the results from one quarter do not guarantee sustained, long-term success. We've improved in many areas, but we still have a long way to go.' This year's first quarter results included an after-tax gain of Dollars 248m, or 43 cents per share, from the recent sale of Federal Systems business. Operational results of this unit were excluded from the 1994 results. The company also took an after-tax write-down of Dollars 192m for a change in software amortisation periods from six years to four years. The accounting change reflected more rapid advances in software technology and a shorter period over which to recover costs, the company said. Excluding these special items, IBM revenues for the quarter grew 6 per cent and net earnings were Dollars 336m, or 54 cents a share. Analysts had been projecting earnings of about 8 cents per share. Gross margins remained stable at 39.2 per cent, excluding the effect of the software write-down. Total expenses fell 23 per cent in the first quarter, mainly because of continuing cuts in personnel and operations. IBM reduced its workforce by 13,000, including 10,000 going with the Federal Systems business, 'We are targeting a further reduction of 28,000 by the end of the year,' said Mr Jerry York, chief financial officer. Revenues from mainframe computers continued to decline, said Mr York, but the rate of decline slowed to about 12 per cent, from more than 30 per cent per quarter in 1993. Sales of personal computers grew strongly, but profit margins were lower than those of competitors, Mr York acknowledged. First-quarter revenues in the US were Dollars 5.3bn, up 6 per cent, excluding the results of the Federal Systems business. European revenues rose 3 per cent to Dollars 4.7bn.

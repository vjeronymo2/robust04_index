			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed GGD/RAY: "General Briquemont Says his </F> Decision Was Made Out of `Weariness'"; as released by Brussels  BELGA Database]    [Text] Zagreb, Brussels, 5 Jan (BELGA) -- On Wednesday [5  January], Lieutenant General Francis Briquemont justified his  request to be relieved as the commander of the UN Protection  Force in Bosnia-Herzegovina, saying that he was "weary" of the  ill will shown by the Bosnian belligerants.    "I feel that here in Sarajevo a mandate of six or seven  months is enough. I can see that everyone who leaves Sarajevo  after six months is tired, and I am not ashamed to say that I am  feeling a certain amount of fatigue. I am not distressed, but  this weariness is undoubtedly the result of many factors. That  is the only reason," he affirmed during a telephone interview  given to RTBF Television from Zagreb.    "The weariness is the result of these constantly repeated  efforts. We constantly discuss the same problems; and we  constantly run up against the same difficulties. There is no  goodwill shown by the parties involved. I have always said that  I was not pessimistic, but I think I can also say that I am not  optimistic either," he added.    When asked about the advice he would give to his successor,  the Belgian officer said that he would give "the same advice  that French Gen. Philippe Morillon (his predecessor -- BELGA  editor's note) gave me: `Be terribly patient.'"    "I would also give him another piece of advice, which would  be to remind the politicians in charge of the difficulties in  which they are putting us constantly, because there is no  coherence in their strategy," he said.    Gen. Briquemont also played down the difficulties he  encountered with the United Nations.    "I will tell you that the problem with the United Nations is  a secondary problem. I believe that, together with Gen. Jean  Cot (the commander of all UN forces in the former Yugoslavia),  we expressed what we thought. When one is in such an  inextricable situation and one is responsible for the lives of  thousands of people, I feel that it is not just a right for the  generals to say what they think but also a duty," he continued.    By the end of the month Gen. Briquemont is to be replaced as  the head of the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) in Bosnia by  British officer Gen. Michael Rose.</p>

Military communications are giving rise to serious complaints,  and cooperation with local administrations in resolving matters  concerning the draft has not been properly established in all  places.    This was stated at a working conference of administrative  bodies of the General Staff and the Defense Ministry held today  by Russian Defense Minister Army General Pavel Grachev.    An ITAR-TASS correspondent was told at the Defense  Ministry's  information and press directorate that the main aim of the  conference was to reveal the ministry's shortcomings and errors  in time, and to assess them.    Among the positive results of the ministry's work since it  was set up, note was made of the elaboration of plans for the  development of the armed forces, for their strategic deployment  and the organization of rear supplies, and the creation of a  blueprint for a military training system.    On conclusion of the conference, Defense Minister Grachev  stressed that the correct conclusions would be drawn in the  armed forces and every measure would be taken effectively to  ensure the security of the state.</p>

			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / Nagano backs bank's 'lottery' The growing row among Japanese banks over a plan by one of them to launch a lottery-linked deposit account was joined yesterday by one of the country's leading businessmen. Mr Takeshi Nagano, the president of the Japan Federation of Employers' Associations (Nikkeiren) told a news conference that he regarded the new account launched by the Johnan Shinkin Bank, the country's largest credit bank, as within the bounds of free competition. Last week the bank provoked fury among its rivals by offering customers a time deposit account that carries with it eligibility for a lottery in which savers can win up to Y50,000 (Pounds 320). The bank's competitors claimed this breached voluntary rules that they would not offer large cash prizes as incentives to depositors. But Johnan Shinkin said the real reason anger was that it had broken a closet cartel that kept down interest rates. Rates were liberalised last month by the Ministry of Finance, but since then there has been little difference between rates offered by the country's banks. The other banks put their objections to the ministry which on Monday set up a panel of inquiry to review the bank's actions. 'It may be a grave matter for the Finance Ministry but I think it is within the framework of liberty for the management of financial institutions,' Mr Nagano said.</p>

			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / Management: Rewards for the top performers - Lucy Kellaway asks if incentive plans are really all they are cracked up to be Eat your greens and then you can have an ice cream. Do your homework and then you can watch television. Work harder and then you can have a bonus. The notion of offering a reward for good behaviour is embedded in Anglo-Saxon culture. Parents do it and so do companies. Performance-related pay, bonuses or other forms of incentive scheme are used by most British and US companies. Those that do not are regarded as being in the managerial dark ages. Imagine the outcry when a respected management theorist suddenly announces that all such reward systems are bound to fail and should therefore be removed. Writing in the latest issue of the Harvard Business Review, Alfie Kohn argues that at the heart of performance pay lies a mistaken view of what motivates people: rewards do not change attitudes or commitment to any task. They simply, and temporarily, change what we do. Kohn draws on dozens of studies in the US which show that at best rewards buy short-term compliance. The more complicated the task, the more ineffective the reward. He argues that incentives are equally hopeless at motivating senior and junior employees. Both on the shop floor and in the boardroom rewards are powerless to increase results. Surveys have failed to establish any link between top pay and company performance. Kohn cites the example of a mid-western manufacturing company, where an incentive system for welders was suddenly dropped. Productivity fell initially, but after a few months was back where it had been before. Six reasons are advanced to support his thesis: Pay does not motivate people. Studies have shown that if you halve somebody's pay you demotivate them, but if you double it the reverse does not happen. Moreover, if you ask people what matters to them most in their jobs, money usually comes well down the list. Rewards are like punishment. Managers have long known that punishment is ineffective, but rewards are just as manipulative of employee behaviour. Those who do not get a reward may feel as if they have been punished. Rewards destroy co-operation between employees in the scramble to compete for them. They also encourage people to suck up to the boss. Rewards mask what is happening in a company. Managers frequently use rewards as a substitute for dealing with the problems that cause low productivity. It is easier to offer a reward than to treat workers well, to give them feedback, support and freedom. Rewards discourage people from being imaginative and from taking risks. Instead, employees focus narrowly on the criterion for the reward, and may even falsify records to ensure the reward is theirs. Rewards divert attention from the job in hand, by encouraging workers to concentrate on the reward rather than on the work. If the work is seen as a means to an end, it becomes less desirable. Kohn is not a lone voice. Other management thinkers in the US - such as Robert Fritz, a composer turned management guru - are reaching the same conclusion. He argues that people are really looking for involvement, not for reward. 'If you have been raised to think: what's in it for me, you can't be involved. Companies should encourage people to play the game for its own sake,' he says. Kohn's article, however, has drawn an angry howl from more traditional management thinkers. Those who make a living from selling such incentive schemes have been left apoplectic with rage. G. Bennett Stewart III of Stern Stewart, a financial advisory firm, fears the very future of capitalism is at stake. He has written to the Harvard Business Review protesting that: 'A world without A's, praise, gold stars or incentives? No thank you, Mr Kohn. Communism was tried and it didn't work.' Jerry McAdmans of the US consultancy Performance Improvement Resources claims that 'Kohn's article is a provocative exercise in attention getting and niche marketing'. Others have taken issue with parts of Kohn's thesis, while admitting that there is good sense in some of it. Andrew Lebby of the Washington DC-based consultants The Performance Group argues that although money is not a motivation it may be valued by employees as a sign that employers appreciate their work. Still others dispute the notion that concentrating on money detracts from the job itself. One reader quotes the poet Anne Sexton: 'I am in love with money, so don't be mistaken. But first I want to write good poems. After that, I am anxious as hell to earn money and fame and bring the stars all down.' Another disagrees that incentives encourage employees to undermine each other, arguing that rewards for teamwork are the answer. It is one thing to dismiss incentives, it is another to come up with an alternative system. Michael Beer, professor at Harvard Business School, assumes the answer cannot be to pay everyone the same and offers his own solution. Managers should not use pay as a means of motivating, but should pay people equitably. There should be no quarterly or annual bonuses. Instead, he argues, the best 10 per cent of employees should be rewarded for outstanding, long-term performance. The worst performers should be 'weeded out'. All the others should be praised and have their contributions recognised. Rather than hand out rewards, Kohn believes companies should offer employees better job content, a share in the decisions and a climate of support. But there is no hope of that as long as they go on treating their people like pets.</p>

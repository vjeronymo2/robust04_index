			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / Arts: Fastest bar in the West - Off the Wall ONE OF London's most cherished monuments, the Albert Memorial, has been covered in scaffolding for almost two and a half years now. It is likely to be many more years before a rehabilitated and restored Memorial comes into view. The Albert Memorial, along with other construction projects underway in the Royal Palaces and Parks, seems set to take the full brunt of the cost cutting exercise underway in the new Heritage Ministry. The penny seems to have dropped that in an enlarged Ministry, with responsibility for broadcasting, sport, the press, etc, as well as the arts, money can be found for the more vociferous lobbys, such as the performing arts, at the expense of the more pacific, like the Royal Parks. A battle royal is taking place between the new Minister, Peter Brooke, and the Treasury over the size of the Department's 1993-94 grant. At first a freeze was proposed for such key clients as the Arts Council but it was pointed out that if the Government reneged here so would arts sponsors, and the arts could lose two sources of income. There was also a feeling that a new Minister deserved a break. Even so, arts companies have been warned to expect at best a marginal increase in grant. And any more money for drama, music, dance, etc. will be at the expense of the poor old Albert Memorial. It would cost around Pounds 14m to restore it to its fully glory, half that to patch it up for 50 years. Neither sum is likely to be forthcoming. The scaffolding may well be the only support the Memorial gets for many years. The fastest bar in the West End is the circle at the Coliseum. That is the kind of vital information that was available at the first Stage Fair, held at the Theatre Royal Drury Lane this week. The Fair was arranged by the Society of West End Theatreas a drum beating occasion. In fact, given the recession, and steadily rising ticket prices, the West End has survived miraculously well to date - audiences are up 3 per cent on the year, although the last month shows a 2 per cent decline on September 1991. Hence the need to sell shows to that increasingly vital customer, the organiser of group bookings. Group bookings - parties of 12 or more - make up 10 per cent of the West End audience now as against 4 per cent six years ago. Of course they are the playthings of market forces. Shows like Phanthom of the Opera have no need of groups, and at the best offer them tickets at face value, while the walking wounded among the musicals (groups concentrate on booking musicals) will offer up to 50 per cent discounts for matinees or Monday nights. The theatre does seem to be getting its act together. Annie Get Your Gun, which opens next month, is actually making another bid for a Sunday matinee audience, despite the extra costs and the fact that previous attempts to develop this market fizzled out. The world's most unlikely capitalists must be the staff and audience of the Theatre Royal, Stratford East, who keep the Red Flag flying with the politically correct plays that make up their programme, along with hit musicals. But now a company, Stratford East Productions, has been capitalised with Pounds 250,000 from mainly tiny 'angels' to take the theatre's current success The Invisible Man into the West End. Stratford's enthusiasm for Shaftesbury Avenue has been fueled by its experience with Five Men Named Moe which has totally transformed the commercial fortunes of the theatre. Moe started at Stratford where it was picked up by producer Cameron Mackintosh who saw its West End and Broadway potential. Mackintosh is rich enough to make a generous gesture and he allocated Stratford a third of any profits, plus additional perks: most producers would have offered just 2 per cent of any gross revenues. Moe has made over Pounds 500,000 for Stratford East. The Invisible Man attracted its share of commercial producers anxious to take it on but none with an offer that compared to the deal on Moe. Hence the decision to form its own production company, which ensures Stratford 40 per cent of any profits with 60 per cent to share among the angels. Other suburban theatres have chased the same money making dream, notably the Lyric Hammersmith and the King's Head, with indifferent success, but Stratford East reckons that it has a certain winner in Ken Hill's adaptation of the HG Wells novel. And, to make this a victory for the little man, the biggest backer of the show, with a Pounds 50,000 stake, is willing to sell off smaller shares to stage-struck investors. The only problem now is Christmas. Unless a West End theatre of around 800 seats falls vacant in the next week The Invisible Man would face the prospect of a December opening, a bad time to launch a new musical. But with everyone so psyched up, a regional tour could probably keep the cast together for a few more months and permit a 1993 West End debut.</p>

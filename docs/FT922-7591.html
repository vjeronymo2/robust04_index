			<p>920518 FT  18 MAY 92 / Armenia attacks key town in Azerbaijan ARMENIAN military formations have taken advantage of the political instability in the Azerbaijani capital of Baku to launch a direct assault on a key town in Azerbaijan. Armenia is trying to create a land bridge between it and the disputed Armenian-dominated enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh in Azerbaijan. The creation of a land link between the Armenian republic and its ethnic kin in Nagorno-Karabakh would elevate the increasingly bitter guerrilla campaign into a full-blown military confrontation between the two Caucasian republics. Such a war would threaten to draw in not only Russia and other former Soviet states, but also Turkey and Iran, which border Armenia and Azerbaijan to the south. Baku itself was reported calm yesterday, after the opposition Popular Front had taken control of the parliament and TV station following the deposition of President Ayaz Mutalibov. His brief reinstatement last Thursday by supporters in the parliament sparked mass demonstrations and sporadic gun battles. Spokesmen for the Defence Ministry and the Popular Front said yesterday troops had been withdrawn to the capital from Lachin, situated between Nagorno-Karabakh and a finger of Armenian territory which pokes into Azerbaijan, reducing the strip of land between Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh to a few kilometres. Mr Azad Ali-Zade, the Defence Ministry spokesman, said yesterday that Armenian forces were attacking Lachin from both Armenia to its south-west and Nagorno-Karabakh to its east. He denied an Itar-Tass report that an Azeri tank column from Lachin attempted to retake the town of Shusha within Nagorno-Karabakh, the last Azeri-held stronghold in the enclave, whose loss last week sparked off the attempt to reinstate Mr Mutalibov. Mr Mutalibov first lost his presidential seat in March, following Azeri reverses in and around Nagorno-Karabakh. Acting presidential power has passed to Mr Yagub Mamedov, leader of the parliament, but he wishes to resign because of ill-health. Mr Mutalibov's whereabouts are unknown. A number of senior members of the Popular Front have been appointed to cabinet posts or as first deputies to cabinet ministers - with the Front dictating the appointments formally sanctioned by decrees of Mr Mamedov, whose resignation has been rejected. The move by Armenia comes after it signed an agreement on collective security with five other members of the Commonwealth of Independent States at a summit in Tashkent on Friday. Azerbaijan, with Belarus, Moldova, Tajikistan and Ukraine, did not sign  - a division in the states which could indicate a further deepening of distrust among them, and possibly an attempt on Azerbaijan's side to appeal to one or more of the non-members of the collective security agreement for aid.</p>

			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / Polls say 43% of voters undecided THE most striking characteristic of Japanese public opinion polls is an unusually high percentage of respondents who either 'don't know' or 'cannot say', a pattern repeated in the final flurry of pre-election polls conducted by Japanese newspapers, Robert Thomson reports from Tokyo. By the reckoning of one newspaper, the Asahi Shimbun, 43 per cent of voters are still undecided, creating great potential for deviation from the generally consistent findings that the ruling Liberal Democratic party will take 220 to 230 of the 511 seats and that the Social Democratic party, the largest opposition party, will be decimated. It appears from opinion poll results that two of the relatively new parties, the Japan Renewal party, formed by Mr Tsutomu Hata, the former finance minister, and the Japan New Party of Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, a former provincial governor, have the longer-term potential to provide competition to the LDP. However, this time round, both parties, particularly the JNP, are stealing opinion poll percentage from the SDP, which has traditionally received the protest vote from disgruntled Japanese. One point of discussion among Japanese political analysts is whether the SDP does better than predicted by the polls, as its forecast fall from the present 134 seats to as few as 60 seats, may prompt some sympathetic voters to come to its rescue on Sunday. The greatest obstacle faced by the new parties has not been convincing voters that they are an alternative, at least to the SDP if not the LDP, but in mustering enough candidates for the election. The JNP has only 57, the JRP 69, and the New Party Harbinger, another LDP splinter group, a mere 16.

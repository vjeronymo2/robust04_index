			<p>921019 FT  19 OCT 92 / International Company News: Accor hit by debt costs of Wagons deal ACCOR, the expansive French hotel and travel group which recently took over its Belgian competitor, Wagons-Lits, in a controversial bid, suffered a sharp fall in first-half net profits. The group, which saw net profits plunge to FFr137.2m (Dollars 27.4m) for the six months to June from FFr427.6m a year earlier, has been hit by the slowdown of the European travel business and by the increase in its own net debt due to the Wagons-Lits deal. The addition of Wagons-Lits brought about an increase in turnover to FFr14.74bn from FFr7.28bn. However, Accor says that without the Belgian acquisition, its interim sales would have risen by 4.6 per cent, just ahead of France's annual inflation rate, to FFr7.6bn. Similarly, net operating profits, which slipped to FFr202m from FFr288.3m because of Wagons-Lits' inclusion, would have been roughly static without it.</p>

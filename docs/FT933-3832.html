			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / UK Company News: WPP sells US advertising arm for Dollars 6.9m WPP, the debt-ridden market-ing services company, has sold Seiniger Advertising for Dollars 6.9m (Pounds 4.48m), of which Dollars 4.9m was paid in cash and the balance in an interest bearing note repayable over five years. Seiniger is a Los Angeles-based producer of marketing campaigns for films. It made a loss of Dollars 900,000 on revenues of Dollars 12m last year. The sale gives rise to an exceptional non-cash charge of Dollars 12m due to the implementation of the UK accounting standard requiring goodwill previously written off to reserves to be written off to the profit and loss account.</p>

			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / Mayhew defends Adams legal aid The decision to give legal aid to Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein leader, to contest the order banning him from mainland Britain was defended by Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, yesterday. Brushing aside protests, he argued that it showed the British system of justice to be 'fair, equal and unpartisan'. Sir Patrick said in Northern Ireland that many in the province would consider the decision 'crazy' and it would probably not have happened in any other part of the world. 'But it shows we do not pre-determine cases or give assistance only to those of whom we approve.' At question time in the Commons MPs protested that Mr Adams was being allowed legal aid because he draws income support from the Northern Ireland Social Security Office. Mr Peter Lilley, Social Security secretary, said he would refer the question to Sir Patrick, who is responsible for social security in the province. Mr David Trimble, Ulster Unionist MP for Upper Bann, said the government should follow the example of Italy, where social security was not paid to Mafia leaders. Mr Nicholas Scott, social security minister, told him: 'I am not sure I would like to draw too far into practices in Italy in respect of the Mafia.' It is expected that the cost of the High Court hearing could be about Pounds 50,000. To qualify for legal aid an applicant must have a disposable income of less than Pounds 2,294 a year. Mr Adams is officially unemployed and draws income support.</p>

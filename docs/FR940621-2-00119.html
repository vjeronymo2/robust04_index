			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Model Facility Pilot Projects <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the January 28, 1994  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (59 FR 4066), the Administrator announced EPA's intent to further develop the ELP concept, initially through a small number (3&hyph;5) of voluntary, facility-based pilot projects. The new Office of Compliance (OC), within the reorganized Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance (OECA), will coordinate the ``model facility'' pilot project effort with significant Regional and State partner involvement. At the same time, EPA opted not to further develop its own ``Corporate Statement of Environmental Principles,'' but rather to work cooperatively with organizations that have developed their own corporate or industry-specific codes. (The Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics will continue to lead any future Agency involvement in this area.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pilot project  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> effort is distinguished from a possible future,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> full-scale  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Environmental Leadership Program. A major goal of the pilot projects is to further explore possible components of a full-scale program. Options were raised during public comment last year on various program elements, including the review and selection process, recognition mechanisms, and other possible incentives for facilities. The pilot projects will explore these options, and will have a definite life span of about 12&hyph;18 months. At the end of this time, EPA will determine if a full-scale program is feasible, and if implementing such a program can help improve environmental compliance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The pilot projects, therefore, represent the experimental first step in the evolution of the ELP. The pilot phase is also an excellent opportunity to strengthen partnerships between government, industry groups, and regulated entities as a prelude to more extensive emphasis by the Agency on voluntary compliance initiatives. The pilot projects, and any future leadership program, will be a vehicle for facilities to continue building positive, proactive relationships with EPA and State and local agencies. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Benefits to Pilot Project Participants <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA foresees a number of potential benefits to facilities that are selected for pilot projects. The Agency will publicly recognize these facilities that demonstrate outstanding environmental management practices, and also provide them with an opportunity to help shape the possible future, full-scale leadership program. EPA will use the pilot projects to evaluate recognition mechanisms and other incentives that could be offered in a full-scale program. While mechanisms for recognition will be determined in discussions with each facility, they may include press releases, letters to community groups, local and State agencies, and/or site visits by EPA officials. It is important to note that any future program would offer recognition and other incentives on a continuing basis (similar to the OSHA Voluntary Protection Program), not as a one-time award. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The pilots represent an opportunity for facilities to inform and directly participate in EPA's effort to reassess its environmental auditing policy. In addition, it is anticipated that the projects selected will generate empirical data useful for evaluating EPA's compliance policies and spur the development of methodologies for evaluating compliance behavior. Finally, EPA is interested in discussing possible policy modifications and other incentives that could help facilities overcome barriers to self-monitoring and compliance efforts. Facilities should address this issue in their proposals for pilot projects. Proposals should focus on incentives that can be offered by EPA's Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance under existing law using administrative authority or policies that lie clearly within OECA's jurisdiction. Proposals to change statutory deadlines, amend environmental standards, or that require actions by other agencies are not appropriate for this program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The remainder of this notice will outline the criteria facilities must address in their proposal to be considered for a pilot project, briefly outline the role of States and EPA Regions, and discuss the proposal review and selection process. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Criteria for Facility Pilot Projects <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The following criteria for pilot projects were developed in response to extensive public comment on the original ELP proposal. In this phase of the ELP, facilities of all types, including small businesses, municipalities, and Federal facilities, <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  are encouraged to submit proposals for pilot projects that address these criteria. Each criterion must be addressed in some way in the proposal; however, facilities may choose to emphasize individual criteria that are appropriate to their unique situation in setting specific goals for a pilot project. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Federal Facilities Enforcement Office (FFEO) is developing a ``Federal Government Environmental Challenge Program,'' as required under Section 4&hyph;405 of Executive Order 12856. This section of the Executive Order requires EPA to develop a Code of Environmental Management Principles for Federal agencies, a program to recognize individual Federal facilities as ``Model Installations,'' and an award system for individual leadership in pollution prevention. For more information on the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Model Installation Program,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> please contact Louis Paley at (703) 308&hyph;8723, or (202) 260&hyph;8790. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since the Federal facility Model Installation program is still in its early stages, Federal facilities may submit proposals for ELP pilot projects. The Office of Compliance and FFEO will work together to use these proposals, and any subsequent Federal facility pilot projects, to help develop the Model Installation program and to ensure that it is consistent with any future, full-scale ELP. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Compliance History <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA believes that the greatest potential for the pilot projects is to demonstrate ``state-of-the-art'' environmental management systems that establish and maintain compliance with environmental statutes and regulations. These systems, when combined with an emphasis on pollution prevention, can lead to improved efficiencies that help facilities exceed minimum compliance standards. To be selected to participate in a pilot project, facilities must demonstrate a commitment to compliance. Therefore, facility proposals must describe their local, State, and Federal compliance history, explain how they have resolved compliance issues in the past, what they are doing to address any outstanding compliance issues, and how they are trying to position themselves to go beyond compliance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Environmental Management and Auditing Programs <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Industry leaders have long recognized the value of self-auditing for environmental compliance and the need to have processes and personnel in place to achieve compliance goals. Facilities applying to the ELP must describe their existing or proposed environmental management and auditing programs, their systems to resolve issues raised by these programs in a timely manner, and their systems to evaluate and adjust these programs on a regular basis. One of the major goals of implementing these management systems and auditing programs should be to move the facility into compliance and position it to go beyond compliance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

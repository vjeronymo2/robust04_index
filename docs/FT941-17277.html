			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / Owen urges action to counter Croat forces: Mediator attacks troop moves into Bosnia Lord Owen, the European Union's mediator in former Yugoslavia, accuses the Croatian government today of sending its army into Bosnia and argues that the world should respond to the deployment 'with considerable strength of purpose'. Joining Croat and Bosnian government negotiators in Vienna yesterday to continue the search for a territorial compromise in Bosnia, Lord Owen accused the warring parties of ignoring the United Nations and ceasefire agreements. In a British television interview to be broadcast tonight, on Channel 4's Dispatches programme, he says a 'very substantial' element of the Croatian army is already operating in Bosnia-Hercegovina. He suggests that the international community should react to that no less strongly than it did to the Serbian military intervention in Bosnia in the spring of 1992. Undeclared military help for the Bosnian Serbs from Serb forces helped the Bosnian Serbs to gain control of nearly 70 per cent of the ethnically complex republic after Bosnia-Hercegovina's declaration of independence. Such covert military and political intervention led to the imposition of UN sanctions against Serbia. Thus far, however, the west has largely ignored a similar build-up by Croat forces over the last six months, Lord Owen argues. The programme concentrates on the role played by the Croatian government led by President Franjo Tudjman in helping Bosnian Croats carve out their own ethnic mini-state of Herceg-Bosna. Covert intervention by both the Serb and Croat governments led to increased pressure from both sides on Bosnia's Slavic Moslem community. But the Bosnian Moslems' determination to fight for land and access to the outside world, and their ability to obtain and manufacture weapons despite the formal arms embargo, has extended the fighting into areas largely populated by Croats. That has led to increased fighting between Moslem and Croat forces who in the early stages of the war in Bosnia often allied with the Moslems against Serbs as the common enemy. The Vienna talks are to work out a territorial deal that would leave the Moslems access to the sea and avoid the mass expulsion of ethnic Croats from areas now threatened by Moslem forces. The talks are being held for the first time under the auspices of a European Union now led by Greece. Athens, still smarting from the recognition of the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia by other EU members, now 'places top priority on solving the Bosnian conflict', Mr Theodoros Pangalos, the Greek foreign minister, said in a French press interview yesterday.</p>

			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / Food and Drink: Appetisers Since my article on the progressive dilution of the major gin brands last year I have received a number of letters from readers who have been scouring their local supermarkets for an alternative to Gordon's. All of these gins have retained the former standard strength of 40 per cent. Waitrose makes a proper London Dry, but it it also sells another, cheaper gin at 37.5. Several readers have also drawn my attention to two own-label gins which have maintained the old level of alcohol: Tesco's and Morrison's. I neglected to mention Bombay Gin made in Warrington, Lancashire, by a subsidiary of Grand Metropolitan. It uses a wider range of botanicals, or flavouring elements, than most and the flavouring material is steamed rather than 'boiled up'. The result is a gin with a laudable complexity. It is sold in Britain at the higher strength of 43 per cent and is perfect for a gin and tonic. One of Austria's most talented chefs, Herbert Lackner, was in London this week to promote the Austrian food festival planned for the spring in the Cafe Mediterranee, St James Court Hotel, Buckingham Gate, Westminster, SW1. Lackner's touch with foods which can be the despair of amateur chefs - sauerkraut and dumplings to name but two - is light and sure. If you think Austrian food is all about hearty soups and one-pot dinners then this will be an eye-opener. Lackner, of the Die Gersberg Alm in Salzburg, will cook at the Mediterranee from March 7 to 25. Tel: 071-834-6655.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Nikolay Gogolev under the rubric "The Press": </F> "Reform of Military Publications: Official Version and Hidden  Agenda"]    [Text] In accordance with an order from Russia's minister  of defense a reorganization--or rather, a reduction--of  educational structures is being conducted in the army. A number  of the functions of educational structures are being transferred  to other agencies and services. For example, law enforcement and  the strengthening of discipline will now be headed by... The  Directorate of Routine and Service of the General Staff.    The military mass media are also being reformed. The fairly  rare ranks of military journals (there are only 14 with a  single, combined edition of around 200,000 copies) is being  reduced by half. Even publications popular not only with the  military but also the civilian readership, such as ARMIYA, the  central organ of Russia's Ministry of Defense, AVIATSIYA I  KOSMONAVTIKA, TEKHNIKA I VOORUZHENIYE and the weekly SYN  OTECHESTVA are going "under the knife." Even at a time of  massive loss of readership, these publications have kept their  subscribers. ARMIYA has even increased its portion.    The magazines VOYENNYY VESTNIK and VOYENNO-EKONOMICHESKIY  ZHURNAL with their great popularity and rich history are also  undergoing reform. As is usually the case in the military  structure, this is being done without taking into account the  opinion of those assigned the functions of founders and without  the agreement of the journalist teams.    The official version of the reform is that the Ministry of  Defense wants to establish a more optimal structure of the  military mass media. It is also prompted, as it were, by the  informational processes occurring in the society and by the  reform of the armed forces themselves. The main factor, however,  is the fact that the funds for publishing the journals are  lacking, and they have to economize.    At first glance it all seems convincing. Especially for one  who has no concept of what is taking place in the military's top  echelons today and believes sacredly that the taxpayers' money  to support the armed forces is being spent prudently and  thriftily.    The journalists themselves believe that there are other  reasons for the reform of military publications, however. They  are revealed in part by an article published in the 2 February  issue of KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA. The author, military journalist  A. Petrov, writes of the danger of eliminating the weekly SYN  OTECHESTVA. The weekly (like a number of military  magazines--N.G.) was not included in the catalog for the first  half of this year, which actually means that it no longer exists.    SYN OTECHESTVA is well known in the nation. It has been  published since 1812. The weekly provides an interesting and  vital account of the armed forces. Like the military magazines,  it performs an important role in the information flow. It firmly  holds to a course of military patriotic indoctrination of the  army and navy youth and contributes to the shaping of the best  qualities of defenders of the homeland in the servicemen.    The weekly may now suffer the sad fate of its companion  journals. The author of a KOMSOMOLKA article bitterly laments  the fact that the number of military newspapers and magazines is  being cut, but not the army of press officials. That army  actually exists. Judge for yourself. During the communist era  the mass media were run by a press section of the well-known  GlavPUR [Main Political Directorate of the Revolutionary  Military Council], fewer than a dozen members (four officers,  two Soviet Army employees, headed by a major general).    The military press is run today by an entire directorate of  information and the press of the Russian Federation's Ministry  of Defense. Major-General Vladimir Kosarev, its chief, naturally  has a higher position rating (lieutenant-general). Like any  self-respecting directorate this one has several sections and  groups headed by colonels. Each section has two or three  officers, of course.    Nor could we fail to mention the press centers of the  branches of forces, troop arms, districts, groups of forces and  fleets, which also contain not just a single dozen press  officials.    And so, the military press is being "optimized" through a  reduction of its small staff.    But even this is not the whole truth, as they say.    Many reformers like to refer to Western models--when it is  to  their advantage, of course. Let me make reference to some  foreign examples. The Pentagon publishes around 400 magazines  and 1,000 newspapers with a total circulation of 12.5 million  copies. In Germany there are around 100 military publications;  in Great Britain, more than 110. We have only 102. To the same  extent we accede to the leading countries of the world in the  concentration of the mass media on the armed forces in the  information arena. And is it not strange that we are presently  artificially cutting these means, actually constricting the  sphere of influence upon military personnel?    The army is rightly considered to be one of the guarantors  of  the state's stability. This accounts for the desire of  far-sighted leaders to strengthen not only its structure but  also its spirit, to see to the moral and spiritual state of the  servicemen. The military press is also expected to perform this  mission. Will it be capable of doing this effectively, however,  after it is reformed?    In an interview with the magazine ARMIYA, Major-General V.  Kosarev commented that the military press is living through far  from the best of times. According to him, this is primarily due  to lack of financing. But our directorate has been given hope,  they say, in seeking a way out, a way to get the money, in close  contact with the Main Directorate of the Budget and Financing....    And they have found it. They are cutting the popular  publications which do not require significant outlays, while  retaining the unprofitable ones with small circulations. Where  is the logic? If, as V. Kosarev asserts, the solution to the  problem lies in funds, then how does one explain the fact that  for almost a year now the magazine CHEST IMEYU (the present name  of SOVETSKIY VOIN) has not been published while continuing to  exist in good standing? And its staff has more than 100 members,  55 of them officers. This is truly a "golden magazine." But  inaccessible to the reader, and not just due to the high  subscription price. The main cause of the "inaccessibility" is  otherwise. Last year the subscribers received only 6 of 12  issues. Incidentally, without any kind of explanation or  compensation. Furthermore a subsidy of 40 million rubles was  required to publish these six issues.    It would be difficult to say how much will be needed this  year. Obviously, no less than required to publish the reduced  list of military journals. Nonetheless, the matter of  reorganizing and particularly of eliminating the former  SOVETSKIY VOIN is not at issue. Furthermore, plans are in the  air at the "upper levels" for publishing this journal jointly  with a Finnish printing enterprise. Can this really cost the  Ministry of Defense less in the present situation?    If "money determines all," do the reformers of the military  press know how to count it? Their most potent argument is that  two publications will replace the seven being eliminated. They  will take on the functions of the former publications.    The number of slots in the military journalists' shop will  indeed be reduced somewhat. Along with this, however, outlays  for publishing the new journals will undoubtedly substantially  increase various registration costs, subscription fees and so  forth. Most important is the fact that these publications will  turn out to be impotent and ineffective, therefore unprofitable.    In general the reform contains a number of paradoxes. Take  just the journal ARMIYA. Its editorial board includes Defense  Minister Pavel Grachev, chief of General Staff Mikhail  Kolesnikov, advisers to the President of the Russian Federation,  and the current chairman of the Defense Committee of the State  Duma, Sergey Yushenkov. One has to ask whether the elimination  of ARMIYA does not mean that the editorial board has "led the  magazine astray"? If that is the case, however, then where is  the guilt of the editorial board whose fate is presently in  question?    All of this raises the question: What is the objective of  the  reform of the military press? Common sense suggests that no  reform is justifiable if it is detrimental to the interests of  the people and the cause. A reorganization of the military press  is inevitable, of course. It is politically justified,  scientifically substantiated and economically expedient. But do  the higher military officials understand this?    And all the time someone continues with enviable persistence  to destroy the military press and the informational arena in the  armed forces. It would be difficult to predict the effects of  this destruction. I shall risk one suggestion, however. If you  agree that a good half of the military members were backers of  Vladimir Zhirinovskiy during the parliamentary elections of  December 1993, how many of them might there be by the time of  the presidential elections?</p>

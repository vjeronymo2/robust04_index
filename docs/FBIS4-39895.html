			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Vesti" program] </F>   [Text] North Korea can produce 65 kg of plutonium a year,  the influential Japanese newspaper YOMIURI writes today quoting  a statement by a senior CIA official.    [Begin G.Kaurov, department head in Russian Atomic Energy  Ministry, recording] According to IAEA information, North Korea  is in possession of grams or kilograms of unregistered  plutonium. But grams or even one or two kilograms of plutonium  are not enough to develop nuclear weapons, not even a single  warhead. [end recording]    [A.Peslyak] The Ministry's official believes that the  conflict between Korea and the IAEA [International Atomic Energy  Agency] started at a level of several grams of plutonium going  unaccounted for.    [Begin Kaurov recording] In Japan 70 kg of unregistered  plutonium-239 have been discovered, and the IAEA did not follow  this with some special sanctions, in this case. [end recording]    [Peslyak] Although following an agreement concluded in the  60s, the USSR built a nuclear center near Pyongyang, with a  research reactor, a chemical lab, and betatron and trained about  60 specialists. As of 1992, according to Kaurov, nuclear fuel  deliveries and visits of specialists were suspended. On the  other hand, according to Kaurov, as recently as 15 year ago U.S.  journals openly published documents showing the structure of  nuclear weapons. So it is difficult to say which actions could  help in creating explosive devices. In order to develop  weapons, however, Kaurov stressed, such actions are needed which  would have been discovered by the technical intelligence  services of many countries. This has not happened. It is  necessary to ensure that North Korea stays covered by the  nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty but, according to the  Ministry's official, one should not get carried away. A  diplomatic way toward nuclear control, sovereignty and universal  security should be found.</p>

			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / Business and the Environment: Why markets are ignoring the issues Most City analysts ignore environmental pressures on companies because they cannot price the impact. Half do not trust information published by companies on their environmental performance and two-thirds think the current standard of reporting is inadequate. These are some of the findings of a survey of 85 top Extel Financial-rated analysts working in 28 sectors. It was conducted by researchers NOP on behalf of the charity Business in the Environment (BiE) and funded by Extel Financial. Most analysts feel the bulk of environmental issues are moral or emotional and are therefore irrelevant to their job of making rational assessments. Sixty-one per cent said the subject was of no interest to their clients, although a third had received requests from clients for more information, especially in the utilities and natural resources sectors. Three-quarters of those surveyed do not see the environment as a competitive issue within the business sectors they cover, but most feel the environment will become more important in the next 10 years. Analysts under the age of 35 are better informed about environmental issues than their older colleagues. Analysts thought that company-produced environmental performance reports should be externally verified to be credible. Meanwhile, a separate report, sponsored by Greenpeace, suggests that investors do not take adequate account of environmental factors when valuing companies, at least in the carbon fuel sector, which includes coal, oil and gas. The author Mark Mansley, an investment analyst, argues that the financial markets are underestimating the risk that global warming will lead to dramatic measures by government to curtail carbon fuel consumption. These measures could include carbon taxes and limits on demand. 'Climate change presents major long-term risks to the carbon fuel industry,' he says. 'These risks have not yet been adequately discounted by the financial markets. The risks increase the longer it takes to develop adequate policy responses to the threat of climate change.' Mansley says that most carbon fuel projects, being very large, take longer than 10 years to pay back, meaning their viability depends on events in the distant future. Typically, markets respond to events only as they become visible, and investors could not be certain that they could sell their stock once the risks of global warming began to materialise. Until this discount had been made, investors should avoid heavy exposure to the oil, gas and coal sectors. Mansley says investors would do better to put their money in alternative energy companies because they offer greater growth prospects than carbon fuel industries. Diversification in this direction would also offset some of the risks of climate change. *City Analysts and the Environment: a survey of environmental attitudes in the City of London.

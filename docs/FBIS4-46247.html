			<p>BFN     [Text] Lima, 26 May (EFE) -- On 25 May the Peruvian Army  concluded the antiterrorist offensive that began in April in the  jungle zone of Leoncio Prado Province, Huanuco Department. [see  item PY2605033494 in previous Terrorism Report] The Army  qualified the operation as successful, despite accusations of  having indiscriminately bombed the civilian population.    The military operation called Aries was aimed against the  Shining Path [SL] members who operated in the area with two  battalions known as Red Sea and Local Force which, according to  military officers, were reduced by 40 percent in Huanuco.    The National Human Rights Coordinating Board claimed in  April  that during the military offensive civilians had been bombed and  innocent people murdered, and that in one area about 50 people  had been killed as a consequence of the excesses committed by  the military.    Committees from several humanitarian organizations, and even  from Congress, visited the Leoncio Prado region to verify the  accusations, after which they said they had not found proof of  bombings or massacres, although they did obtain some reports of  human rights violations committed by the military.    The military chief of the zone, General Alfredo Rodriguez,  reported at the end of the operation that the two terrorist  battalions had been disbanded, and that the SL columns still  remaining in the jungle zone north of Lima are out of contact,  without provisions, and partially disarmed.    The general added that the Red Sea battalion was reduced to  40 men, and that the Local Force members were disbanded. He  added that Red Sea chief Jose Picon, aka Manco, and another 20  SL members abandoned his group and hid in Monzon area.    Rodriguez said that the SL groups are trying to replenish  their ranks with young men they kidnap from the different jungle  towns and whom they force to join the SL ranks under threat of  death.    The military chief considered the Aries operation to be  successful, as "it has left the subversives with few weapons"  and "a great deal of ammunition" was confiscated from them.    According to the military officer the terrorists are trying  to reorganize themselves, for which reason the Peruvian military  forces cordoned off the area to prevent them from doing so.    Gen. Rodriguez nonetheless pointed out that the ending of  the  Aries operation does not mean that the military have stopped  exerting pressure in the area, because they must prevent the SL  bases from reorganizing.    On 25 May the military high command presented to the media,  at the Tingo Maria military base in Leoncio Prado Province, 23  SL members captured during the operation, during which a total  of 30 men were arrested. The military also showed to the media  the weapons, explosives, medicines, communications equipment,  documents, and propaganda material confiscated from the  terrorists.    Gen. Rodriguez showed a copy book in which an SL member  known  as Comrade Angel had written an order to his comrades to  "facilitate the access of the Red Cross to all the combat areas."    Gen. Rodriguez said he suspected that members of the Red  Cross were informing the SL of Army movements, something which  has not been proven.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Amman, AL-DUSTUR -- Nabil 'Amr, political adviser  to Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat, will leave Amman today  for the occupied Palestinian territories on his first visit  since 1967.    'Amr said he will visit his relatives and hold contacts and  consultations with Palestinian political forces and nationalist  figures in the West Bank and Gaza Strip to pursue efforts made  last year to set up a Palestinian democratic grouping.    'Amr said this grouping is a developed formula of the  initiative proposed by 116 Palestinian personalities from inside  and outside the territories in a memorandum that called for  enhancing democracy in the Palestinian arena inside and outside  the territories.    'Amr added that this initiative does not conflict with the  fact that he is a member of Fatah or with his official duties in  the PLO.    'Amr worked as director general of Palestinian radios for 10  years, and then as a media adviser to the Palestinian president,  and ambassador to the Soviet Union for five years.</p>

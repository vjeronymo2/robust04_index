			<p>Language: <F P=105>Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Russia is calling for the convening of a second  Madrid conference to rescue the peace process in the wake of the  Hebron massacre, the INTERFAX news agency, quoting Russia's  Deputy Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov, reported tonight.    Our Arab affairs correspondent Ehud Ya'ari reports that the  move came as a surprise, has not been coordinated with the  United States, and clashes with the U.S. Administration's effort  to renew the process.    Our political correspondent Gadi Sukenik reports that  Jerusalem rejects the idea and stresses that only the format  decided on in the original Madrid conference is the framework  for negotiations.    [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 2000 GMT on 9 March in  a  similar report adds: "The Foreign Ministry in Jerusalem said in  reaction that Israel rejects the proposal to reconvene the  Madrid conference, because it has gone a long way in the  bilateral peace talks, but adds that if Russia raises an  official proposal on the matter, Israel will look into it and  respond accordingly."]</p>

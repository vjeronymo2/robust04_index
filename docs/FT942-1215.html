			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / Japanese trade surplus 'key to currency flux' Economic fundamentals are the most important factor for exchange rate levels and will have to be addressed if the rise in the yen is to be halted, Mr Yasushi Mieno, governor of the Bank of Japan, said yesterday. Market intervention alone could not guide exchange rates to desired levels, he added. At a speech at the National Press Club, Mr Mieno said Japan's huge trade surplus often surfaced as a key factor behind the yen's rise and measures to correct it were 'the most important' in dealing with currency problems. Confusion over his remarks sent the dollar tumbling towards the Y100 level early yesterday in Tokyo before European and US markets opened. The governor's remarks were interpreted by currency traders as casting doubt on the effectiveness of central bank intervention to halt the yen's rise, and an admission that the bank's action to support the dollar had failed. Later, however, a Bank of Japan official said the markets had misinterpreted the governor's remarks. Mr Mieno had said intervention was effective in stemming the dollar's fall but it could not guide currencies to precise levels. In his speech, the governor said there were some benefits from the rising yen - it would help promote industrial restructuring as companies were confronted by the need to become more internationally competitive. He again expressed optimism about prospects for economic recovery, citing recent sharp increases in exports and personal spending. But he warned that corporate investment would remain sluggish as companies continued to adjust to over-accumulation of capital in the late 1980s.</p>

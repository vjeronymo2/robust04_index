			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: MMB seeks rise for butter-making milk THE MILK Marketing Board for England and Wales yesterday called for 'a substantial increase' in the price of milk sold for butter following the collapse of plans to reform milk pricing. The board had intended to introduce a new way of pricing milk earlier this year based on the supply profile, with a premium being charged for regular deliveries. Milk production peaks in May and falls off sharply in summer. The plan would have ended the much criticised present pricing system under which 24 different levels are set according to the use to which the milk is put. But it ran into legal problems with the European Commission earlier this month. The MMB blames the collapse on the UK Dairy Trade Federation's refusal to give up a part of the plan providing continuity of milk supplies. However, the Dairy Trade Federation, which has to agree on pricing methods with the MMB, said yesterday that its was disappointed at the MMB's abandonment of the plan, which it believed could still be salvaged. It also suggested that the latest pricing proposals were not in the interest of consumers or - following CAP reform - producers. Milk will continue to be priced under the 'end-use' system, with the highest prices being charged for liquid milk consumption. At present liquid milk is 24.75p a litre, and butter-making milk is 17p a litre. The MMB wants all prices to be raised, but it wants to narrow the gap between the liquid milk price and the bottom range. The board pointed out that the wholesale price of liquid milk was last raised in December 1990. It believes that dairies can afford to absorb higher prices without raising prices to the consumer. The collapse of the price reform plan means that end-use pricing is likely to remain in place until the 60-year-old MMB is wound up, probably in early 1994. The board plans to turn itself into a national voluntary co-operative. Preliminary results of the MMB show that Pounds 2.23bn was paid to wholesalers for 1991-92, up 1.3 per cent. The average price paid to dairy farmers rose 4 per cent to 19.98p a litre. Production fell 2.6 per cent to 11.14bn litres, mainly because of quota cuts. The board said continued high demand for milk for liquid consumption (50 per cent of the total) has concentrated the effect of the quota cuts on milk for manufacture, which suffered a 5 per cent cut in availability.</p>

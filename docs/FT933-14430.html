			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / International Company News: James Capel analysts quit THE HEAD of research and at least one other analyst from the Latin American department of James Capel have resigned to join Bear Stearns, in an effort by the US brokerage to boost its coverage of emerging markets, writes Damian Fraser in Mexico City. James Capel confirmed that Mr Geoffrey Dennis, head of research, and another analyst had quit, and that other defections were possible. But Mr Mark Donegan, head of emerging markets for James Capel, said: 'If there were other resignations they would be very junior.' Bear Stearns confirmed the hirings but declined further comment. However, it is known to have made coverage of emerging markets a priority.</p>

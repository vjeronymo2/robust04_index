			<p><P> May 22, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PALESTINIAN WOUNDS 10 IN ATTACK ON FRENCH TOURISTS;  </P> <P> JORDAN: GUNMAN TRIES TO AVENGE SLAYINGS OF SEVEN ARABS BY AN ISRAELI,  AUTHORITIES SAY IN AMMAN.  </P> <P> A Palestinian gunman, shouting slogans of revenge on behalf of the "Gaza  martyrs," opened fire Monday on a busload of French tourists in Jordan,  spraying them with bullets before pulling out a dagger and stabbing two  passengers cowering behind the front seats.  </P> <P> Nine tourists and a Jordanian photographer were injured in the mid-morning  attack in downtown Amman, which security officials said was to avenge the  killing of seven Palestinians from the Israeli-occupied Gaza Strip by an  Israeli near Tel Aviv a day earlier.  </P> <P> "Where are you, Gazans?" the gunman yelled as he boarded the bus, according to  witnesses, and at one point during the attack referred to the "Gaza martyrs."  </P> <P> Within minutes of the attack, police arrested the man, identified as Ahmad  Badwan, 28, a Palestinian from the Gaza Strip currently residing in Amman.  </P> <P> French Embassy officials said five of the injured tourists were treated and  immediately released. Four others, including a 55-year-old Parisian listed in  critical condition, were hospitalized. A 30-year-old Jordanian photographer  accompanying the tour group was listed in stable condition with gunshot wounds  to both hands.  </P> <P> "It was an isolated attack carried out by a lone gunman," the Jordanian  Information Ministry said, quoting an unidentified security official. "The  Jordanian government expresses its deep regret and strong denunciation of this  criminal act and wishes to assure everyone that justice will take its course  and that such acts will be dealt with with utmost stringency."  </P> <P> The attack came amid heightened tension all over the region after the Sunday  shootings near Tel Aviv by an Israeli.  </P> <P> In Amman, thousands of protesters chanting anti-American slogans and waving the  Koran, the holy book of Islam, marched near the U.S. Embassy, wire services  reported. Some hurled rocks at police, who fired tear gas and used armored cars  to seal off the street where the embassy is located.  </P> <P> Also, protesters at a Palestinian refugee camp near Amman closed the  Amman-Damascus highway Sunday night by throwing stones at passing vehicles, and  at least 20,000 Palestinians staged a demonstration northwest of the Jordanian  capital Monday, chanting "No to Arab Silence!" Thousands more Palestinian  refugees demonstrated at camps in Lebanon.  </P> <P> In Cairo, Egypt's fundamentalist Muslim Brotherhood denounced an impending  visit to Cairo by Israeli Labor Party leader Shimon Peres and criticized  Egypt's conciliatory stance toward Israel.  </P> <P> At a news conference in Amman, Yassir Abed Rabbo, a senior Palestine Liberation  Organization official, condemned the attack against the French tourists, saying  it provided cover for Israeli actions against Palestinians.  </P> <P> "We condemn all acts of violence against civilians and believe this was a  suspect attack aimed at covering up Israeli actions in the occupied territories  and diverting attention from what is happening there," he said.  </P> <P> The 46-nation Organization of the Islamic Conference, in a statement issued  from its headquarters in Jidda, Saudia Arabia, said Sunday's shootings by the  Israeli were part of a "world Zionist plan and deceitful conspiracy aimed at  terrorizing the Palestinians and forcing them to leave their country for the  benefit of hundreds of thousands of Soviet Jewish emigrants (arriving) with the  view of building a Greater Israel."  </P> <P> Jordanian security officials said the incident began at 9:50 a.m., when a  busload of 34 French tourists was disembarking in downtown Amman to visit the  city's Roman amphitheater.  </P> <P> Witnesses said the attacker followed the panicked tourists back onto the bus,  exhausted his ammunition and then drew a dagger and stabbed two tourists who  had taken shelter behind the first row of seats. There were conflicting reports  as to whether the gun was a rifle or a pistol.  </P> <P> "He forced everyone to the back of the bus, and he started shooting  indiscriminately," one witness to the incident said.  </P> <P> It was not known why the gunman targeted the French tour group, which had  arrived in Jordan on May 18 for a weeklong tour.  </P></p>

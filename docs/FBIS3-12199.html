			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Baghdad, 26 Feb (INA)--Iraqi newspapers today  stressed that the Zionists' crime in Hebron will continue to be  a disgrace to the Zionist entity, America, and all the dwarfs of  those who betray their people and nation. Victory is always for  the people.    In their editorials, the papers denounced the heinous  Zionist  crime which was perpetrated by the fascist Zionists against  Muslim worshipers at the Ibrahimi Mosque in the West Bank city  of Hebron yesterday, Friday. The papers said that the dreadful  Hebron massacre shows the treacherous fascist nature of the  Zionist Movement and its plotting against the Arab nation and  the Palestinian Arab people's entity.    The newspaper AL-QADISIYAH calls on the Arab and Muslim  masses to rise up against the agent regimes, the Zionist entity,  and all those who perpetrated and supported the Zionists' crime  in Hebron, which defied the feelings of the Arabs and Muslims in  their most sacred holy places and rites.    In its editorial under the headline "A Condemned Abominable  Zionist Crime," the paper says: This criminal act proves that  the Zionists are thirsty for the blood of Muslims and Arabs, and  that they have always been seeking to kill and persecute them  and to confiscate their right in Arab Palestine.    AL-QADISIYAH stresses that the Zionists and their masters  must know that this brutal crime and similar despicable hostile  acts perpetrated against Muslims in the occupied Arab  territories will only strengthen their resolve, escalate their  valiant intifadah against the repression of the Zionist entity,  and will clearly expose those who are desperate for a settlement  and those who pant after the mirage of the Gaza-Jericho  agreement.    The paper says: The odious Hebron massacre has exposed the  treacherous fascist nature of the Zionist Movement and its  plotting against the Arab nation and the Palestinian people's  entity. It reminds us of the Zionists' massacres in Dayr Yasin,  Bahr al-Baqar, Abu Za'bal, and elsewhere.    The paper explains that this dreadful Zionist crime proves  the Zionist entity's insistence on ignoring the feelings of all  Arabs and Muslims, confiscating the Palestinian Arab land, and  annihilating the Palestinian people in a way that exposes Arab  regimes that are linked with the foreigner as well as those who  are desperately panting after capitulatory solutions of the  settlement Arabs.    Concluding its editorial, the paper says: The sons of  Palestine are now bolstering their unity with the trench of the  eternal Mother of Battles. At the same time, the facts of the  Mother of Battles have clearly showed Iraq's ability to stand  fast in the face of the Zionist-Atlantic-U.S. satan and its  local agents and traitors. Iraq's steadfastness in the eternal  Mother of Battles and the Palestinian people's intifadah will  continue to be the torch which will dissipate Arab darkness and  lead to the Arab nation's historic awakening.    The newspaper AL-'IRAQ stresses that what took place at the  Ibrahimi Mosque at dawn on Friday, the 15th of Ramadan, the  month of worship, faith, fasting, and piety, was a new Zionist  crime and an abhorrent massacre to be added to the criminal  enemy's record of ceaseless acts of killing, annihilation, and  mass liquidation of the sons of the Palestinian people, which it  has been carrying out since its establishment in Arab Palestine.    In its editorial, the paper says: This crime, which was  perpetrated by the enemies of God and humanity, the murderer  Zionists, has exposed the true nature of the Zionist enemy and  its criminal scheme to annihilate the Palestinian people and to  uproot them from their holy land through escalating the killing  and pursuing of the Palestinian citizens by the occupation  forces and settlers who are actually professional military men  in civilian clothes, and who have been supplied with the same  weapons used by the regular army personnel.    AL-'IRAQ adds: Those who scrutinize the enemy's negotiations  record and its dirty and twisted methods, beginning with the  Rhodes negotiations in 1948, passing through the Camp David  Accords with al-Sadat, and ending with the series of meetings  which were held in Norway, Switzerland, France, and Egypt, will  emerge with one conclusion only; namely, that this treacherous  fascist enemy does not believe in peace, will not recognize Arab  rights, and has no intention to withdraw from a single inch of  Palestine.    The paper stresses that the history of the Arab-Zionist  conflict has proved that one cannot count on any solution no  matter how capitulatory this person maybe and regardless of  whether he is responsive to the Zionist avarice or not. This is  because our enemy, as the statements of its officials show,  beginning with Moshe Sharit [name as transliterated] and  Ben-Gurion and ending with Yitzhaq Shamir and Yitzhaq Rabin, is  simply committed to the Zionist dream.    The paper notes that the new crime will not affect the  official U.S. and European stands, especially since the U.S. and  Western media, particularly the ill-famed British BBC which,  from the very beginning of the massacre, tried to play down the  true number of martyrs and wounded, and to show that what has  happened was only the the act of an individual Zionist settler.    Concluding its article, the paper stresses: We are very  confident and certain that this odious massacre will only  strengthen the determination of our brothers in the occupied  territories to adhere to their sacred land and rights. We are  facing a criminal usurper enemy which only understands the  language of force, fateful confrontation, and challenge until  final victory is achieved and until its evil and expansionist  schemes are defeated after we retaliate for all the galaxies of  martyrs on the road of struggle, and intifadah for the sake of  maintaining Palestine's Arab identity.    AL-JUMHURIYAH calls on the Arabs and Muslims to honestly  raise their voices and say: Shame on America which is  sponsoring and committing the Zionist crime and protecting the  perpetrators. Under the headline: "God is Great: They Are  Slaughtering Us Collectively in the Name of Human Rights," the  paper says: America's followers are not satisfied with violating  honor, demolishing mosques, killing children and starving old  men. Furthermore, they indiscriminately shoot worshipers in a  place protected by God. The paper asks: Has this crime shaken  the consciences of those who shook hands with the people whom  they themselves once said that any hand extended to those people  will be chopped?    AL-JUMHURIYAH adds: He who wants peace with the Arabs will  not kill their children, steal their lands and waters, and  demolish their mosques. Yesterday's crime revealed that the  peaceful settlement is a lie and a delusion and that walking  this road is a falsehood.    Addressing the U.S. president, AL-JUMHURIYAH says: You well-  mannered Clinton: You must remember that human beings are the  same throughout the world, in America and elsewhere. Therefore,  your reaction is strange if you really believe in what you call  human rights. How can you invade a country with your country's  armies to guarantee the freedom of expression, as you say, while  watching in silence the killing of hundreds, in fact thousands,  of people with the guns and in accordance with the decisions of  your army and followers in other countries and in the United  States?    Concluding its editorial, AL-JUMHURIYAH says: We are  disgusted by your hypocrisy O Americans. The entire world  despises your slogans and symbols. Are you aware of this, or  will the cowboy continue with his crimes until he falls in a  grave which he will dig with his own criminal acts?</p>

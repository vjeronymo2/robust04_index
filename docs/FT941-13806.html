			<p>940124 FT  24 JAN 94 / Radio 2 may be moved to Midlands The BBC is considering moving the headquarters of Radio 2 to Birmingham from central London. It would be the first time that a national BBC radio network has been based outside London, Raymond Snoddy writes. Radio staff were told last week that Mr David Hatch, chief adviser to Mr John Birt, the BBC director-general, would be carrying out a feasibility study. Mr Hatch is a former managing director of BBC Radio. The decision reflects growing attempts to move programme production outside London. The BBC will give details today of its new combined news and sports service, which will be called Radio 5 Live to reflect its new task of covering the latest breaking news and sports stories.</p>

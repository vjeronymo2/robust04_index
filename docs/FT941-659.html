			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / Pearson up 38% following focus on media Pearson, the publishing and information group, yesterday marked its transformation from conglomerate to media group with pre-tax profits of Pounds 208.6m for 1993, a rise of 38 per cent. Although the comparison is with a poor 1992, when profits fell 16 per cent to Pounds 151m, all the main Pearson businesses showed increases in operating profits. The figures also included a Pounds 20m write-down on the headquarters of the Financial Times, bought for Pounds 74m at the height of the property boom. Lord Blakenham, chairman of Pearson, warned yesterday that although 1994 had started strongly, it was 'a year of transition'. The group would not have the benefit of the profits from the demerged Royal Doulton china group and would have more modest dividends from Camco, the oil services company, after the sale of a majority stake. He emphasised that, while continuing to build on the written word, the company would continue to put more money into screen-based businesses. The pre-tax profits of Pounds 208.6m were earned on sales up 12 per cent, from Pounds 1.15bn to Pounds 1.28bn. Earnings per share emerged at 27p (19.3p) on an FRS3 basis, or 27.9p (17.3p) excluding exceptionals. The recommended final dividend of 7.625p raises the total by 1p to 13p. Pearson wrote back a Pounds 71.4m provision made in 1990 for its investment in British Sky Broadcasting (BSkyB), the satellite television venture that has now moved into operating profit. This was largely offset by a loss of Pounds 66.2m on the sale of a 55 per cent stake in Camco. Books performed well with a rise in operating profit from Pounds 80.4m to Pounds 102m and newspapers rose from Pounds 31.1m to Pounds 48m. The FT Group, including Les Echos in France, increased pre-tax profits by 12.1 per cent to Pounds 42.3m with the FT newspaper showing underlying growth of 14 per cent, although there was a small decline in operating profit to Pounds 12.2m because of Pounds 2.3m in redundancy payments. Visitor attractions, such as theme parks, increased operating profit from Pounds 12.2m to Pounds 15.8m and investment banking was up from Pounds 23.7m to Pounds 36.4m. The City reacted well to the results and the shares finished 31p up at 666p. Mr Neil Blackley, media analyst at stockbrokers Goldman Sachs, is forecasting pre-tax profits this year of Pounds 247m, including Pounds 10m from the 17.5 per cent stake in BSkyB.

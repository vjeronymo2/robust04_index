			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / UK Company News: Exports rise helps lift Prestwick 31% Prestwick Holdings, the printed circuit board manufacturer, raised pre-tax profits by 31 per cent, from Pounds 81,000 to Pounds 106,000, in the half year to January 31. The two principal plants at Irvine and Ayr increased overall sales by 20 per cent through expansion of the customer base. Exports from those units rose 68 per cent and 89 per cent across the group. Sales came to Pounds 18.1m (Pounds 13.9m). Additional operating profit earned from the increased sales was adversely affected by development costs associated with new contracts, and disruption costs caused by erratic delivery demands from some customers. After the preference divided there were losses per share for the period of 0.02p (0.13p). The interim dividend is held at 0.5p.</p>

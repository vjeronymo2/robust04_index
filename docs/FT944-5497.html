			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / Lloyd's expects rise in business Lloyd's of London expects to underwrite insurance policies paying premiums worth about Pounds 9.2bn next year - about Pounds 800m higher than in 1994, according to a survey released yesterday. The rise will be largely the result of underwriters making greater use of funds available. Total underwriting capacity of Lloyd's insurance market - which depends on the volume of money invested by Names and companies - may even fall slightly. The percentage of available gross capacity used for underwriting is expected to rise to 84 per cent next year from 78 per cent this year, suggests the poll of Lloyd's agencies responsible for managing the market's insurance syndicates. The Pounds 9.2bn figure for 1995's premiums excludes the impact of a planned change in Lloyd's procedures for allocating risks to particular years which takes effect from January. The upturn in business at Lloyd's follows two relatively good years: both 1993 and 1994 are expected to produce profits when results are released under Lloyd's three-year accounting system. The legacy of losses in the late 1980s and early 1990s is expected to lead to a further outflow of Lloyd's Names, individuals whose assets have traditionally supported the insurance market. But investment from new corporate companies for the 1995 underwriting year has been higher than expected. Latest figures suggest Lloyd's capacity next year will be between Pounds 9.9bn and Pounds 10.9bn.</p>

			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / International Company News: Campbell advances to Dollars 108.5m CAMPBELL SOUP, the US food group, yesterday reported a rise in after-tax profits to Dollars 108.5m in the third quarter to May 2, from Dollars 91.5m a year earlier. Sales during the three months rose by 6 per cent, to Dollars 1.63bn, mostly due to the first-time consolidation of Campbell's ownership interest in Arnotts, the Australian biscuit company in which the US group has a 58 per cent stake. At the earnings per share level, the profits advance translated into a 19 per cent rise, to 43 cents. On a divisional basis, Campbell said operating profits in its North and South American divisions rose by 10 per cent, to Dollars 172.6m. In Europe and Asia, there was a 14 per cent advance, to Dollars 9m. In the biscuit and bakery division, the inclusion of the Arnotts' results lifted profits by 47 per cent to Dollars 23.9m - but Campbell said that, without Arnotts', there would have been a 6 per cent decline due to certain start-up and new product costs. Campbell increased its stake in Arnotts to 58 per cent earlier this year after a bitterly-contested takeover battle, although it still lacks board control. The third-quarter figures bring after-tax profits for the first nine months to Dollars 149.2m, compared with Dollars 381.3m a year earlier, or 59 cents a share compared with Dollars 1.51. However, the current-year figures are struck after significant restructuring charges taken in the second quarter; Campbell said that without these items, net earnings for the first nine months were up by 18 per cent. Campbell announced in the second quarter that it was closing two domestic frozen food plants and selling a number of unspecified businesses. These moves resulted in the Dollars 300m after-tax charge.</p>

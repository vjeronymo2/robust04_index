			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / Finance &amp; the Family (Briefcase): Mirror wills WHEN WE both retired and sold up in 1989, because of the impending changes in taxation, we split our purchases of securities in half and registered half in each name. Our only other income is my wife's state retirement pension and my state invalidity pension. We are thinking of the time when one of us dies and the possible problems of half the income stopping until the estate has been processed; I would add that we have made mirror wills making each other the only beneficiary. Should we leave a minimum amount in individual names and re-register the rest in our joint names or have we already taken the best course of action? It would be possible to have joint holdings of securities and still be treated as each being in receipt of half the dividend income. On the other hand if the survivor is the named executor in the will there should be no serious cash flow problem over dividends. The real question is whether it is necessary to have wills if you are able and willing to have all the assets in joint ownership. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

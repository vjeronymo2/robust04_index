			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / Tate &amp; Lyle falls as US weather hits sales and crops TATE &amp; LYLE, the sugar and sweeteners group, announced a drop in pre-tax profits from Pounds 230.8m to Pounds 189.5m for the year to end-September, with poor weather in the US blamed for much of the fall. The reduction was the company's first profit reverse for 14 years. However, Mr Stephen Brown, chief executive, said he was 'extremely bullish about this year' and expected a 'rebound in profits'. The eight weeks trading since the September year-end underscored this view, he said. The shares rose 12p to 368p. A final dividend of 8p is proposed, up from 7p, to give a total of 12p, a 7.1 per cent rise. The dividend is covered more than twice by fully diluted earnings per share of 26.2p, down 20.6 per cent. Mr Neil Shaw, chairman, said the dividend increase reflected the 'long-term cash generative nature of the business'. He said the group faced no lack of opportunities and had made heavy investments, for instance in eastern Europe, but these were yet to make a return. Developments in the common agricultural policy, the Gatt talks and the North American Free Trade Agreement were not negative and some might be positive for the group, he said. Group sales rose 3.2 per cent to Pounds 3.4bn, but problems in Tate's US sugar and corn sweetener subsidiaries hit pre-interest profits, which fell from Pounds 280.5m to Pounds 237.4m. At this level the net interest charge of Pounds 47.9m, down from Pounds 49.7m, was still covered 5 times. Staley, Tate's US high fructose corn syrup business, suffered as poor summer weather depressed soft drinks sales and overcapacity in the industry put pressure on prices. Pre-interest profits in the division fell from Pounds 96.8m to Pounds 65.3m. A new chief executive has been hired. At Western Sugar, the US sugar beet business, a frost followed by a thaw damaged the beet. Western was barely profitable and profits from the US sugar division, which includes cane, fell from Pounds 49.3m to Pounds 30.9m. Good performances were seen in UK sugar refining, where productivity rose, and a record tonnage was processed in Portugal, where Tate has increased its stake in Alcantara from 62 per cent to 97 per cent, and at Bundaberg, the Australian sugar business acquired in June 1991.

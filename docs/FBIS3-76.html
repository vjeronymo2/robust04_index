			<p>Arab     boycott offices will soon submit a report to the Arab  League, according to a dispatch from Damascus published in the  Kuwaiti daily AL-WATAN, alleging that the Israeli Government plans  to take advantage of its Arab neighbors in comprehensive fashion.  The dispatch enumerates the ways in which the plan is taking shape,  and complains of U.S. and other governments' acquiescence to it.      The Kuwaiti Arabic-language daily AL-WATAN carries an article  from Damascus on 9 March 1994 by Safwan al-Bunni which summarizes a  report the correspondent obtained which is purportedly to be  submitted by the offices of the Arab boycott of Israel to the Arab  League ministerial session "next month."      Al-Bunni says the report reviews Israel's economy and Israeli  moves to end the boycott.  He claims the report will aver that  Israel is striving for "a strategic political security plan  which will "...permit Israel, quantitatively a small, weak country,  to be a strong, large country with the stamp of a regional great  power."  He further quotes it as saying, "Israeli thinking is  shifting to a superpower strategy with the goal of transforming  itself into a regional superpower, which it would not be able to do  without the solid start that it achieved with the implementation of  projects described at the time as very ambitious."  The report  states that the necessary conditions for national security are  military power supported by economic power, according to al-Bunni,  and also claims Israel is trying to obtain U.S. aid in currency  instead of goods, because of its belief that this type of investment  will enable it to experience "a second industrial revolution."      The report to the Arab league warns, says al-Bunni:      That Israel turned to the arms trade in the Eighties because of  the tremendous profits to be gained there, which were necessary to  continue operating its military industries.      That Greenpeace charged that Israel's production of methyl  bromide for pesticides has caused 3 percent of the hole in the ozone  layer and that its Bromine plant in the Negev Desert produces one  third of the world's supply of this chemical.      That an Egyptian diplomatic document claimed that Israel "still  continues to steal water in the occupied territories in the Syrian  Golan, southern Lebanon, and Jordan      That the same Egyptian document said the Israelis are researching  the water table near the Egyptian border and that they are planning  to build 32 dams, "beginning at the headwaters of the Nile River in  Ethiopia."      That a joint U.S.-Israeli project will enable Israel to expand in  the Mediterranean, that Israel is intensifying its exploitation of  Jordan and Litani River waters, and that it is also making progress  on the proposed Mediterranean-Dead Sea canal.      That Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin has affirmed that  "Unified Jerusalem is the capital of Israel, is not negotiable, and  is not on the agenda of the Israeli delegation's talks with the  Palestinian delegation."  According to al-Bunni, the report terms  the 1982 law annexing Jerusalem and establishing it as Israel's  capital as "the strategic guide for Israeli public policy" no matter  which party leads the country.      Turning to the Arab boycott of Israel itself, Bunni says that the  report states that the United States has attempted to break it by  various means, citing in particular remarks in March 1993 by Edward  Djerejian, the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Near East and  South Asian Affairs, to a Congressional committee that Secretary of  State Warren Christopher had emphatically urged the Arab governments  to end the boycott.      The report also cites Jewish Agency sources on the poor prospects  for significant immigration from the Commonwealth of Independent  States and U.S. data on the emigration of Israelis to the United  States over the last six years.      The report, Bunni says, concludes by outlining the U.S. position  on the boycott--that ending it is a positive move that supports the  peace process--noting that the Japanese, Korean, and German  Governments have bowed to U.S. pressure in the last two years,  allowing their companies to do business in Israel.

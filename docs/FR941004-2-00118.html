			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Such certificates are only an option for CITES Parties that are also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> parties to the other treaty, convention, or agreement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 24. Disposal of Confiscated Live Animals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> No document has been received from the CITES Secretariat yet.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This issue was discussed at the Animals Committee, and the Service believes that the Animals Committee prepared a draft resolution that will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discussed at COP9. The Service has not yet received the final draft  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resolution prepared by the Animals Committee. However, the Service is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supportive of uniform guidelines for the Parties on how to deal with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> confiscated live animals, that will benefit both the welfare of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individual animals and the conservation of their species in the wild. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Service is supportive of such guidelines, consistent with U.S. law. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Service is concerned about the risk of introduction of disease to wild  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> populations from confiscated live animals being considered for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reintroduction programs. The Service believes that transport and handling  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concerns for live animals should be coordinated with the Working Group on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Transport of Live Animals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Interest in what Parties should do with confiscated specimens, particularly live animals, goes back to the drafting of the Convention. The re-export of Appendix II specimens does not require a Scientific Authority finding. The Parties have spoken quite clearly on the issue of return of confiscated specimens to the country of origin, when feasible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 25. Disposal of Skins of Illegal Origin  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> No document has been received from the CITES Secretariat yet; no position  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is possible at this time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 26. New Criteria for Amendment of Appendices I and II  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> See Doc. 9.41_New Criteria for Amendment of Appendices I and II.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Support adoption of the alternative Annexes submitted by the United States  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on this issue, rather than those prepared by the Standing Committee (as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pertain to Annexes 1 and 2 of the draft resolution). The United States  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> basically supports the other annexes of the Standing Committee resolution.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The existing CITES listing criteria, known as the ``Berne Criteria''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Resolutions Conf. 1.1 and 1.2) were developed at the first CITES  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Conference in 1976 in Berne, Switzerland. The United States agrees that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Convention will be strengthened by reevaluating the Berne Criteria for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> listing species in the Appendices, and that the Berne Criteria need to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reviewed and adapted to address a broader array of taxa and to be more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> descriptive and definitive, to the extent possible. At the same time, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> United States notes that an inherent strength of CITES, which must be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> safeguarded, is its ability to seek balanced conservation-based solutions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for a broad range of species and populations being considered. Thus, if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any revision of the Berne Criteria is to be adopted at COP9, the United  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States is supportive of retaining maximal flexibility while firmly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maintaining scientific credibility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The move to revise the Berne Criteria originated at the 1992 CITES  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Conference, in Japan (COP8). At COP8 the Parties agreed to start a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process, coordinated by the Standing Committee, to develop a scientifically  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sound revision for consideration at COP9 in 1994. The World Conservation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Union (IUCN) was asked to do a first draft, which would first be reviewed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at a joint meeting of the Standing, Animals and Plants Committees, and put  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> into CITES resolution form. The United States participated in a joint  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meeting of the Standing, Animals, and Plants Committees in Brussels in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> August-September 1993, which reviewed the IUCN draft and produced a draft  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resolution that was circulated to the Parties.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Service submitted comments to the Standing Committee, after  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consultation with other Federal agencies and reviewing extensive public  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comments received. The U.S. comments maintained that much of the draft  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resolution was not valid scientifically, and was not acceptable from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> management or practical perspectives. The United States believed that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> criteria as proposed met neither the CITES treaty's requirements for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conservation of species in their ecosystems, nor the diverse needs of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CITES Parties. The U.S. comments and those of other Parties were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discussed at the 31st meeting of the Standing Committee, in Geneva in March  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1994. Some of the U.S. comments were taken into consideration in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> developing the final Standing Committee draft resolution. The Standing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Committee resolution was not available to the United States or other CITES  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Parties until after the June 10 deadline for submission of resolutions and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposals to the CITES Secretariat. The Standing Committee resolution  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contains six annexes, several of which the United States looks forward to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discussing further with the CITES Parties at COP9. In particular, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> United States believes the Standing Committee draft is an improvement on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Berne Criteria as regards precautionary measures. However, the United  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States believes that Annex 1 (Biological criteria for Appendix I) and Annex  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2 (Criteria for inclusion of species in Appendix II) are in need of major  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> revision, particularly from a scientific perspective. The United States is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> particularly concerned about the utility and scientific validity of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> arbitrary numerical cutoffs for decision-making on which Appendix a species  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should be included in. After detailed review of the scientific literature  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and consultation with other Federal agencies, the United States has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> submitted alternatives to those Annexes to the Secretariat, along with some  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional material for inclusion in the resolution. The U.S. intent is to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> urge the CITES Parties to substitute the Annexes 1 and 2 it submitted for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those prepared by the Standing Committee.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The United States could have waited to present these alternative Annexes 1  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and 2 at COP9. However, the United States preferred to provide ample time  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to Parties to review this proposed alternative to the document submitted to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Parties by the Standing Committee. The United States believes that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increased flexibility must be included in any revised listing criteria.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The biological criteria submitted by the United States for inclusion of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> species in Appendix I (Annex 1) are grounded in the scientific literature,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and are based on the concept that determination of whether a species is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> threatened with extinction should be risk averse, utilizing the best  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available scientific and trade information, and assessment of a series of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> biological factors and criteria. The proposed Annex 1 lists a series of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interdependent factors to be included in an assessment of the status of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> species, and thereby the determination that it is threatened with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> extinction. The criteria for inclusion of species in Annex 2 (in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accordance with Article II paragraph 2(a)) of the Convention involve a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determination of whether a species may become threatened with extinction,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in order to avoid utilization incompatible with its survival.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Service received numerous comments recommending that the United States  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> submit an alternative to the Standing Committee draft resolution. Several  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comments provided detailed analyses of the IUCN submission to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretariat, and of the resolution submitted to the Parties prior to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 31st meeting of the Standing Committee. These comments were taken into  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consideration by the Service and other Federal agencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 27. Inclusion of Species in Appendix III  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> No document has been received from the CITES Secretariat yet. However, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Service is aware that a resolution on this issue has been prepared by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Animals Committee. The Service is supportive of urging of more judicious  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use of Appendix III, including recommending direct consultation with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Animals or Plants Committee and a review of existing Appendix III listings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

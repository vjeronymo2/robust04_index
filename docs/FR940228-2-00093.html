			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> SEC Staff Comments on SR&hyph;NYSE&hyph;76&hyph;54 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In response to proposed changes to Rules 96, 102, and 105 that were submitted in file No. SR&hyph;NYSE&hyph;76&hyph;54, the SEC staff suggested that the Exchange's proposals be revised so that Floor professionals would be permitted to use listed options only for hedging purposes. <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>  Most of the SEC staff's comments were directed specifically at specialists' trading of specialty stock options pursuant to Rule 105. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The NYSE submitted File No. SR&hyph;NYSE&hyph;76&hyph;54 to the Commission on October 22, 1976. The proposed rule change was noticed for comment in Securities Exchange Act Release 12924 (October 27, 1976), 41 FR 48430 (November 3, 1976). The file, like other options proposals that raised significant regulatory issues, became dormant during the ``options moratorium'' in order to allow the Commission to complete its Special Study of the Options Markets. Shortly thereafter, the NYSE refiled its proposals to amend Rule 96 (File No. SR&hyph;NYSE&hyph;82&hyph;19) and Rules 102 and 105 (File No. SR&hyph;NYSE&hyph;82&hyph;20). In early 1985, the Commission approved the latter rule filing, thereby permitting NYSE specialists to trade options on their specialty stock but, consistent with the staff's earlier comments, only for hedging purposes.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Securities Exchange Act Release No. 21710 (February 4, 1985), 50 FR 5708 (February 11, 1985). The amendments to Rule 96, however, were noticed but never received Commission approval.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Securities Exchange Act Release No. 20006 (July 26, 1983), 48 FR 35217 (August 3, 1983). On March 15, 1993, the NYSE withdrew File No. SR&hyph;NYSE&hyph;82&hyph;19 and resubmitted the substance of that proposal as this File No. SR&hyph;NYSE&hyph;93&hyph;17. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> While Rule 105 permits specialists to use listed options to offset the risks of making markets in stocks in which they are registered, the Exchange does not believe that it would be appropriate to re-structure Rule 96 along the lines of Rule 105. A ``hedging limitation'' in such a re-structured version of Rule 96 would have the effect of requiring Competitive Traders and RCMMs to use listed options only to offset the risk of loss in stock positions which they acquired as a result of orders in such stocks that were initiated on the Floor. In practice, such a limitation would be even more restrictive than the current regulation, which, as noted above, permits Floor professionals to trade in listed options, but simply precludes them from initiating an order on the Floor in a stock which underlies such option position. The Exchange does not believe that making Rule 96 even more stringent than it is today would serve any valid regulatory purpose. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As noted above, Rule 96 does not prohibit a Competitive Trader or RCMM from trading in options, but provides only that he may not initiate a proprietary order on the Floor in any stock where he has an option position in that stock. The Exchange does not believe that any sort of ``reverse hedging limitation'' in Rule 96 would make sense because it would mean, in effect, that a Competitive Trader or RCMM could initiate a proprietary trade on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Floor if necessary to hedge an option position. However, the primary dealings of RCMMs and Competitive Traders are in stocks, not the overlying options. In the Exchange's view, a ``reverse hedging limitation'' in Rule 96 would bear no relation to the practical business dealings of RCMMs and Competitive Traders, and would constitute an unnecessary burden of over-regulation given the minimal potential for trading abuse. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Statutory Basis <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The statutory bases for the proposed rule change are sections 6(b)(5), 6(b)(8) and 11A(a)(1)(c)(ii) of the Act. By removing the prohibition on Competitive Traders and RCMMs initiating proprietary transactions on the Floor in a stock where they have a listed option position in such stock, and thereby permitting such members to add to the depth and liquidity of the Exchange market in situations where they may not currently do so, the proposed rule change will have the effect of ``facilitating transactions in securities'' and will ``perfect the mechanism of a free and open market,'' as called for in section 6(b)(5).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To the extent that the proposed rule change permits Floor professionals to initiate transactions on a more equal regulatory footing with other securities professionals, the proposed rule change is designed to eliminate unfair discrimination between brokers or dealers, as called for in section 6(b)(5); to remove a burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act, as called for in section 6(b)(8); and to promote fair competition among brokers and dealers, as called for in section 11A(a)(1)(C)(ii). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> April 27, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SALE OF EASTERN'S ROUTES TO AMERICAN APPROVED  </P> <P> The government on Thursday approved the sale of most Eastern Airlines foreign  routes to American Airlines and awarded a new Texas-Tokyo route to Continental  Airlines.  </P> <P> President Bush has the authority to reject either deal if he believes that it  will harm U.S. national security or foreign policy interests.  </P> <P> The Transportation Department's decision, made tentatively 10 days ago,  includes the transfer to American of Eastern's Central and South American  routes as well as its Miami-Madrid flights and a Miami-London route operated by  Continental, Eastern's sister carrier in the Texas Air group.  </P> <P> The department refused to allow the transfer of Eastern's Florida-Toronto route  as part of the deal, saying it would examine the proposal further and consider  selecting a carrier other than American to operate the service. Three other  carriers have indicated an interest, officials said.  </P> <P> A bankruptcy judge last week turned Eastern over to a trustee, removing it from  the control of Texas Air Corp. owner Frank Lorenzo.  </P> <P> Eastern's previous management had said sale of the routes to American, approved  by the bankruptcy court, was key to Eastern's financial plans. American had  agreed to pay $349 million, but that sum included the Toronto route.  </P> <P> The awarding of a Houston-Honolulu-Tokyo route to Continental ended competition  among six carriers for a service formerly belonging to Federal Express.  </P> <P> The cargo service, lost by Federal Express when it took over Flying Tiger Line,  which already had U.S.-Japan cargo authority, has been expanded to include both  passenger and cargo service.  </P> <P> Continental and three other carriers -- America West, Aloha and Delta --  proposed a Honolulu-Tokyo route to replace the Federal Express service.  Hawaiian Airlines wanted to run the service between Honolulu and Nagoya and  American proposed a service between San Jose and Tokyo.  </P></p>

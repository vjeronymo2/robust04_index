There he was met by the Colonia mayor and then  talked to the press.    [Begin recording] [Sanchez de Lozada] Well now, we hope for  informal and frank bilateral approaches and approaches with  Mercosur [Common Market of the South]. We hope we will be able  to approach this market that is so important for Bolivia and  that will become more important in the future.    [Unidentified reporter] The Uruguayan press announced during  the past few hours that Presidents Lacalle, Menem, and Wasmosy  [of Uruguay, Argentina, and Paraguay, respectively] reportedly  have virtually accepted Chile's and Bolivia's entry in the near  future.    [Sanchez de Lozada] Well now, we have some problems because  we are still part of the Andean market. We do not want to quit  this pact. Nevertheless, we would like to become a hinge and  actually be received by this agreement. If there is such a  political will, it would be something good, but we will wait for  this to become official. If it becomes official, we will  consider it with much interest.

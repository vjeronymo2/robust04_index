			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / Pentagon problems outlast Les Aspin: A tough job under fire Both President Bill Clinton and Mr Les Aspin were immensely correct and mutually complimentary on Wednesday evening when Mr Aspin's resignation as US defence secretary was announced. Difficult though his tenure had often been, there seems to have been no specific last-straw policy disagreement or overriding personal circumstance that prompted him to go. Mr Aspin, who had a heart pacemaker inserted this year, had dealt with much controversy. The list includes ending the ban on homosexuals serving in the military and giving women frontline combat roles, the decision not to send additional US heavy armour to Somalia before the October Mogadishu firefight, the 'Bottom-Up Review' of the US military entailing substantial real reductions in the defence budget, the 'partnership for peace' approach to European security, base closures, cutting the reserves and more besides. Much of this will not be undone, and much of it owes a great deal to Mr Aspin's sense of how far the Congress could be pushed in any direction. Although some of his former congressional colleagues suspected him of ceding too much to the military leadership over the force structure issue and over the compromise he worked out for allowing gay men and lesbians to serve in the armed forces, others believe he accurately assessed the point where compromise could be reached. The political costs, however, were heavy, outside and inside the Pentagon. He inherited a defence department coming off more than a decade of military build-up (plus the victory in the Gulf war) and very content with the compatible leadership of Dick Cheney, the previous secretary, and General Colin Powell, who retired in late summer as chairman of the joint chiefs of staff. The Aspin style, brought over from 22 years in Congress, was entirely different. Though his intellect and military expertise commanded respect, he was often disorganised, curious and theoretical, qualities directly at odds with the idea of a structured military mind accustomed to taking clear orders. A bevy of similarly-minded senior advisers meant the civilian command of the US military was sometimes dismissed by the top brass as 'Aspin University'. Paradoxically, he became a target of Congress because he did not behave like a classic defence secretary. Mr Clinton's insistence on collegiality may have been a constraining factor to such a free thinker. Mr Aspin may also feel he suffered from a lack of clear and consistent foreign policy direction from a president whose own expertise was primarily domestic. But the net effect was that the foreign policy triumvirate - Warren Christopher, the secretary of state, Anthony Lake, the national security adviser, and Mr Aspin - was under constant attack as things went wrong. The Aspin weakness was that he was never as close to the president as the other two, whose trust had been earned in the heat of a presidential election campaign. Thus it might well have been, as Washington thinks, that he was pushed out of the Pentagon because he sensed he had lost the absolute confidence of the president. With Mr Aspin's departure, however, the whole question is re-opened of how the US armed forces should be structured to face post-cold war threats, a question he had sought to deal with in the Bottom Up Review, whose results he announced three months ago. In recent weeks, Mr Aspin has been at odds with the White House over a Dollars 50bn (Pounds 33.5bn) gap between the amount allocated to defence by the Office of Management and Budget over the next five years and the Pentagon's estimate of what it needs to pay for the force structure settled on, with Mr Clinton's blessing, in the review. Even if this was not the last straw provoking Mr Aspin's departure, it is an issue that will not go away for his successor, retired Admiral Bobby Ray Inman. Some military analysts foresee even greater financial problems in the long term if the Pentagon sticks to the strategy outlined in the Bottom Up Review. Mr Andrew Krepinevich of the Defence Budget Project, a Washington think tank, estimates the Clinton budget could fall as much Dollars 30bn or Dollars 40bn a year short of demands of the review. While many defence analysts found the review to be a solid intellectual exercise, some thought its results had been determined by its premises, which sought to maximise the possible threats the US might face and so justify a larger military structure than might otherwise have seemed necessary. The review's very terms of reference called for 'a thorough and compelling list of New Dangers', which led to the conclusion that the US had to be ready to fight two nearly simultaneous big regional conflicts. 'It was overkill - a way of justifying a major military structure by inventing demons,' said Rear Admiral Eugene Carroll, who heads the Centre for Defence Information, a Washington research organisation. Admiral Inman could seek further budget cuts within the Bottom Up framework, or he could look for an entirely new assessment of force structure needs. But unless Russia's election results provoke a lasting shift in attitudes towards defence spending, he is unlikely to be able to preserve his budget at its current Dollars 260bn-a-year level.</p>

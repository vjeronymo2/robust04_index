			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 1 KYODO -- Prosecutors indicted former  Construction Minister Kishiro Nakamura on Friday [1 April] on a  charge of accepting a 10 million yen bribe from leading  contractor Kajima Corp.    As a member of the House of Representatives, Nakamura, 44,  pressured the Fair Trade Commission in 1991 not to file a  criminal accusation against a group of 66 contractors over  suspected bid-rigging, prosecutors allege.    Nakamura received the money on January 13, 1992, from Shinji  Kiyoyama, then vice president of Kajima, the indictment said.  At the time, Nakamura was acting head of the then governing  Liberal Democratic Party's panel on antimonopoly affairs.  Kiyoyama, 68, was charged Tuesday with bribing Nakamura.    If found guilty, Nakamura could face up to five years in  prison, according to the penal code.    The indictment said Nakamura repeatedly urged then FTC  Chairman Setsuo Umezawa not to file a criminal accusation with  prosecutors against the cartel. Umezawa announced on May 15,  1992 that the FTC would not file the accusation against the  group. It is not yet proven whether Nakamura influenced the FTC  decision.    Prior to his arrest on March 11, the prosecution asked the  Diet to lift Nakamura's parliamentary immunity, which provides  that Diet members cannot be arrested while the House is in  session. The lower house voted March 10 to approve the request.    Nakamura served as construction minister from December 1992  to August 1993 under then Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa. He is  the only Diet member thus far to be arrested and indicted in  connection with a series of scandals involving construction  firms and politicians.    Since last June, two governors, two mayors and more than 20  executives of eight top contractors have been arrested.</p>

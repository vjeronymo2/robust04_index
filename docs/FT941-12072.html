			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Nottingham coming to market with Pounds 80m tag - Issue News Nottingham Group, which under its NES Arnold trade name claims to be the UK's largest educational supplier, is expected to be valued at over Pounds 80m when it comes to the market in the spring. Goldman Sachs, arranging and underwriting its first UK flotation, and James Capel, the stockbroker, will seek to place and sell through intermediaries shares worth at least Pounds 14m. Flotation terms are still under discussion but Nottingham needs Pounds 14m to redeem preference shares, issued to 3i and Citicorp Capital Investors Europe, its venture capital backers. Whether they will retain equity is not yet clear. Management, led by Mr David Mansfield, holds about 20 per cent of the equity. How much new capital will be sought from the market depends on whether Nottingham decides to clear all its debt, currently about Pounds 3m, and on whether it wants funds for expansion. The decision to seek a market flotation springs out of studies on the way in which a Pounds 36.8m management buy-out from Coats Viyella in 1989 might be refinanced. 'There is no pressure from the venture capitalists, but their dividend demands get more painful as time goes on', said Mr Mansfield. Pre-tax profits have been rising steadily, reaching Pounds 7.1m on sales of Pounds 48.3m in 1992, the last year for which figures are available. Profits for 1993 are likely to be higher.</p>

			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / Business dismayed as markets get jittery Dismay was the common response among South African businessmen yesterday to the imminent departure as finance minister of Mr Derek Keys, whom they credit with having put the country's finances on a sounder footing during two years in office which spanned the transition to democracy. Bond, equity and currency markets all reacted negatively in an afternoon of rumour-laden turmoil before his confirmation last night that he was stepping down. The unexpected resignation was a blow to growing confidence of international investors in South Africa, which was increasingly being tipped as a fashionable 'emerging' market. Mr Cedric Savage, president of the South African Chamber of Business, said it came as a surprise and shock to business that Mr Keys felt obliged to resign so soon after the inauguration in May of the government of national unity. 'Financial markets and business confidence are likely to react negatively to this development,' he said. Although the overall stock market dropped only three points on the day to close at 5,451, bond yields climbed above 15 per cent after starting at 14.5 per cent, and the financial rand, the country's investment currency, regarded as the best barometer of international investor sentiment, fell 12.5 cents from R4.72 to the dollar in London to R4.845. The news is a particular blow for the stockbroking community, which has been aggressively marketing South African shares abroad in the wake of Mr Keys's recent budget, which was widely praised for prudence and commitment to cutting the budget deficit. 'There's no question it will be viewed as a major negative, especially overseas, where Keys was known and trusted,' said another broker. 'He was a stabilising and reassuring figure and his departure will cost South Africa dearly.' The resignation could also spell trouble for the first global offering of convertible bonds for a South African company. Robert Fleming is in the process of 'book-building' - sounding out investors - in a Dollars 360m to Dollars 500m offering for Liberty Life, the country's fourth largest company. The deal is due to be priced on Tuesday. 'I do want clarity before I commit to this deal,' said one London-based international fund manager. 'Part of the comfort with South Africa was that the people in charge of the economy were running a tight ship.' Mr Ian Hannam, the banker in charge of the offering at Robert Fleming, admitted the news had caused concern but said 'no investors have dropped out as a result. The most important thing is who will replace Mr Keys'. Businessmen were inclined to accept at face value Mr Keys' statement that he was leaving for unspecified personal reasons. Mr Donald Gordon, chairman of Liberty Life and TransAtlantic Holdings, and one of Mr Keys' oldest friends, commented: 'I would believe they are genuine reasons. He would not put his name to anything like this unless it was true.' 'We're all quite amazed,' said Mr Peter Davey of brokers Frankel Pollak Vinderine, 'It's all so sudden. Everything seemed to be going so well, particularly with the economic team of Keys and (deputy finance minister Alec) Erwin.' Investors feared strict controls on public spending in Mr Keys' June budget would not be implemented and the government would be tempted to meet its new spending commitments by more borrowing. 'Keys was seen as a tough negotiator who could stand up to the many competing claims on the governments resources,' said Mr Graham Bell, head of bond research at Baring Securities in London. 'The markets were also unnerved by the manner of the resignation, which was basically bad PR.' 'Mr Keys had credibility in the eyes of the financial markets,' said Ms Wendy Niffikeer, senior economist at IBJ International. 'His resignation will dash investors' confidence in South Africa as an emerging market in which they can invest strongly.'

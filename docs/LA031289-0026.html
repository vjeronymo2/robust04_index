			<p><P> March 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEFINING COMEDY  </P> <P> Harold T. Wright's March 5 letter certainly seems to define comedy differently  than I. Among his examples of Academy Awards given to actors in comedic roles  he includes:  </P> <P>  -- William Holden for "Stalag 17," one of the most gripping and saddest dramas  ever filmed. A few tension-breaking scenes do not a comedy make.  </P> <P>  -- Ingrid Bergman for "Murder on the Orient Express," a sophisticated murder  mystery.  </P> <P> George Sanders for "All About Eve," a dated but still painful story of  conscienceless betrayal. Not comedy.  </P> <P> Barry Fitzgerald for "Going My Way." Yeah, it's always high comedy to watch a  loveable curmudgeon learn to see other views and then die.  </P> <P> Edmund Gwenn in "Miracle on 34th Street," a morality play that used Santa Claus  to make a point, ahead of its time, about child neglect. Ho, ho, ho!  </P> <P> DIANE SILVER  </P> <P> Arleta  </P></p>

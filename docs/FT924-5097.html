			<p>921128 FT  28 NOV 92 / De-listing penalty urged QUOTED COMPANIES should be required from next summer to state whether they comply with the Cadbury code of corporate governance on pain of de-listing by the Stock Exchange, the Cadbury committee has decided. The recommendation will come in the final version of the Cadbury report due out on Tuesday, and represents determination by the committee to stand fast against opposition to the penalty by the exchange. Companies failing to provide a statement in their annual accounts saying they comply with the code - or giving reasons why not - are likely to be forced by the Stock Exchange to issue a statement. Any which did not comply could ultimately be de-listed, although the Stock Exchange is keen to play down this measure. In an interview with the Financial Times, Sir Adrian Cadbury, chairman of the committee on the financial aspects of corporate governance, called the disclosure 'an essential piece of the machinery' for effective corporate governance. He said the main parts of the report would resemble the original issued last May, with greater clarification of the recommendation that non-executive directors remain an integral part of a unitary board of a company with the same obligations as executive directors. This follows criticism from bodies including the Confederation of British Industry that the report called for non-executive directors to take on a separate, supervisory role, creating a two-tier board structure. The report will continue to request a statement of compliance, but will rely on the Auditing Practices Board to develop detailed guidelines on which aspects of the code auditors will comment. Sir Adrian said the new version of the report would be written more clearly in an effort to make it a more usable long-term guide for boards. It will also acknowledge that there are some concerns over the Caparo judgment in the House of Lords, which severely limits the legal responsibilities of auditors. Sir Adrian criticism that the recommendations would not prevent another failure of corporate governance such as the activities conducted by the late Robert Maxwell. He argued that it would influence the greater majority of companies. Some 210 organisations and individuals have responded to the code. Sir Adrian said the report would be followed by a series of other studies outside the present remit of the Cadbury committee including the role of shareholders playing a larger role in corporate governance, covering such issues as putting up resolutions to a meeting; greater disclosure of executive pay; and the long-term role and structure of boards.</p>

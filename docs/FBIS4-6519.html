			<p>BFN     [Text] Following the promotion of telecommunication  cooperation between the ROK and Iran, the ROK may be able to  export more time division exchanges [TDX] to Iran.    The ROK and Iran will hold the third meeting of the  telecommunication cooperation committee for four days starting  20 April in Tehran, Iran to reinforce telecommunication  cooperation between the two countries.    During the meeting, the ROK plans to request Iran's support  for ROK TDX companies' participation in biddings, propose a  technical cooperation agreement, and recommend the exchange of  information concerning policy on privatizing the  telecommunication business.    Iran is considering a telecommunication network development  project which requires a total of 3.6 million lines of switching  facilities to be supplied from 1994 to 1996. Daewoo is  considering participating in the international bidding for the  TDX to be held in May.    Daewoo installed 18,000 lines of its TDX-1B in Hamadan, Iran  in February 1992.</p>

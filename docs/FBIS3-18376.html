"The  partly real and partly imaginary sick man, which is how our  neighbors sometimes perceive our country, is beginning to gain  ground again," Stihl said at the annual reception on the eve of  the DIHT general assembly in Bonn.    Stihl said that the overall image has been lightened by the  positive economic signals from the United States, Latin America,  and Southeast Asia. Foreign demand was gradually increasing, and  in some branches the order books are becoming fuller again,  while domestic demand was benefiting from the diminishing  tendency to price increases. Germany was seeking and finding  new paths to keep its position in the increasingly stiffening  international competition and to overcome the structural crisis,  Stihl said. Due to the high public debts of almost 2 billion  German marks [DM], it is still necessary to keep spending low.  Wage agreements must not be concluded for those who still have  work without solidarity with those looking for jobs. More  permeability and competition are necessary in the education  system. Moreover, "naive debates" about modern technology must  no longer be conducted. People must cease taking advantage of  the state as a self-service market, Stihl said. "There is no  longer a balance between the hunt for individual advantage and  the support for the commonweal in Germany."    As official speaker at the DIHT annual reception, French  Economics Minister Edmond Alphandery expressed his support for  the German-French partnership and for European monetary union.  For more than 10 years, France has pursued a policy of  stability and is more than ever ready to put monetary union into  practice. Alphandery pleaded for a more resolute political  commitment to reach progress regarding the convergence in the  European national economies. The common struggle against rising  unemployment was of preeminent importance, the French minister  said.</p>

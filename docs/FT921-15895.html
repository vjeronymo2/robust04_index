			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / Survey of Kenya (7): Little interest from abroad - Investment, Unemployment problem sits on the horizon IF KENYA is to avoid a serious unemployment problem later in the decade, it will have to invest a good deal more and make that investment more productive. By sub-Saharan standards its recent investment record is relatively good, with fixed investment (ignoring inventories) averaging almost 20 per cent of gross domestic product. The capital output ratio has been close to four - implying that Kenya has to invest Dollars 4m to obtain a Dollars 1m increase in output. This means that to grow at 5 per cent a year, Kenya must invest four times that - approximately 20 per cent of GDP. Unfortunately, 5 per cent growth is inadequate, given Kenya's population growth rate and age profile, so that a 20 per cent investment ratio is just not good enough. The country's capacity to maintain investment at current levels depends heavily on foreign funding. Not on foreign direct investment, which averaged Dollars 30m annually during the 1980s, but on aid grants and loans. Domestic savings, as a share of GDP, have declined in recent years, partly because of the government deficit. The result has been that between one-fifth and a quarter of total investment is funded from abroad and in a world short of capital, this is a precarious situation. The Kenyan response - like that in many other African countries - has been to promote private investment by establishing an Investment Promotion Centre, seeking to create an enabling environment to foster private entrepreneurship, and establishing export processing and manufacturing-under-bond zones. However, foreign investors are staying away, which is hardly surprising given the two-year dividend remittance pipeline. Rapid exchange rate depreciation compounds the problem: a KPounds 17.8m dividend was worth Dollars 1m in 1988, but by the time it could be remitted in 1990, it had depreciated to Dollars 775,000, thereby sharply lowering the foreign shareholder's return on his investment. Nor has foreign investor sentiment been helped by Kenya's poor international media image. The IPC, established in 1982 as a department within the Ministry of Finance, was converted to an autonomous parastatal five years ago, charged with promoting foreign and domestic investment, acting as a one-stop-shop for investors, and advising government on policy reforms needed to increase investment. Officials insist the centre's chief task is promotional - to attract and motivate investors and then help them through the labyrinth of Kenya's tangled, overlapping bureaucracy. They have been instructed to get a project fully approved within a month, but acknowledge that it takes five to six weeks. Businessmen say it takes longer, pointing out that even when the IPC has obtained its basic approvals from the relevant government departments and the central bank (where applicable), there are often other licences and permits to be obtained - work permits, and trade and import licences. The IPC has processed more than 229 applications since 1988, resulting in project approvals totalling some Dollars 350m, and creating 23,200 jobs. Not all approvals are actually translated into projects, and an IPC list of 123 approvals shows that less than one-third are operational. Another third has been approved, but these are held up because the promoters have yet to raise the necessary capital or are looking for a joint-venture partner. A handful have been rejected including one submitted by Colgate Palmolive, while eight projects cannot go ahead until suitable land is made available. Ten of the 120 were abandoned after being approved, while the remaining 20 are under construction or awaiting the arrival of imported machinery. Most of the 35 operational projects are small, representing a total investment of less than Dollars 30m. Particularly disconcerting is that only about 10 per cent of the project list is expected to generate foreign currency, though there could, be significant import savings. The list is far from complete since investors are not obliged to go through the IPC, although they are advised to do so. One official estimates that as much as 30 per cent of new projects bypass the centre. The IPC hopes to expand its activities abroad in the next few years, opening a second European office - it has one in Zurich - as well as establishing a presence in the Asia Pacific region and the US. The slow response is not surprising, given that less than 2 per cent of global foreign direct investment goes to Africa. Kenya does not offer a package of attractive investment incentives - except in the EPZs. Non-EPZ investment qualifies for export compensation for non-traditional and manufactured exports, import tax and VAT exemptions on imported plant and equipment and tax breaks on investment in plant and machinery. Foreign investment is guaranteed against expropriation, and while dividends, profits and royalties are freely remittable, there is a two-year queue which has encouraged some companies to reinvest. Kenya is a signatory to the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (Miga), and has signed the US Overseas Private Investment Corp (Opic) agreement. The EPZ package is far more attractive - a 10-year tax holiday, followed by a 25 per cent rate of corporate tax, exemption from exchange controls, and no withholding taxes on dividends. The IPC's belief that there are attractive opportunities in agro-processing, horticulture and tourism is well-founded, though there are very real environmental and crowding-out constraints on tourism, while international competition in horticulture is increasing rapidly. Whether Kenya can attract investment in electronics, pharmaceuticals, chemicals, engineering and vehicle components is more problematic. With the declining importance of low-skilled labour in many manufacturing activities, Kenya does not have much to offer by way of competitive advantage. Its best hope perhaps is as Africa's third growth pole - after South Africa and Nigeria - exploiting its geographical position as the hub of the east African market. But that is not a large market by international standards, and not big enough to yield the scale economies so essential to profitable manufacturing and export in many industries today.</p>

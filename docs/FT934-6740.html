			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russia calls for 8% world-wide aluminium curb Russia is proposing that the world aluminium industry should cut annual production by about 1.5m tonnes, or 8 per cent, to help bring supply back into line with demand. Producers in the Commonwealth of Independent States would be willing to share in this world-wide reduction but would resist any pressure for them to bear most of the burden. This was made clear yesterday by Mr Igor Prokopov, president of Concernalumini, the CIS aluminium association, during a presentation at a symposium to mark the 75th anniversary of the Belgian Non-ferrous Metals Federation. European Commission officials suggest, however, that discussions with the CIS aluminium industry about limiting exports to the European Union are deadlocked. Agreement in principal has been reached about the need for CIS export restraint, including a method of double checking by the use of both export licences in the CIS and import licences in the EU. But 'the Russian industry does not like the numbers being proposed', said one. The commission, which in August imposed restrictions on CIS aluminium imports to the end of November, hoped to complete negotiations this month. Now it is considering whether to continue the restrictions. It feels an EU/CIS arrangement would not conflict with attempts to get agreement between most of the big aluminium producing countries, who are to meet in Washington on December second. Mr Prokopov's suggestion of an 8 per cent production cut obviously will be repeated at the Washington meeting, which will be attended by a large delegation from the industry, the Russian government and some of the western trading houses that have been involved with the CIS smelters. Yesterday he indicated that the CIS industry had accepted some of the European industry's proposals when he said that some of Russia's smelters would have to shut down so that their highly polluting, old fashioned technology could be replaced. He also suggested the CIS industry would be heavily involved in toll smelting in future, that would involve processing raw materials supplied by western organisations, which would continue to own those materials and the metal produced from them. It is far from certain that the CIS industry's proposal for further production cuts will be well received. Mr Dick Dermer, president of the European Aluminium Association, said yesterday that a 1.5m-tonne cut would not be deep enough. It would take four or five years to reduce world aluminium stocks and the industry could not wait that long if every member was to survive intact.</p>

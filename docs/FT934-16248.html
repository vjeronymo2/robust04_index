			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / Ageism in the workplace AGE DISCRIMINATION is rife throughout the European Community. That is the conclusion of a spate of reports published this year as part of the European Year of Older People, the most recent by the pressure group Eurolink Age. Top of its list of villainy is the practice of targeting employees over 50 for redundancy and retirement programmes. Also criticised are job advertisements specifying that candidates must be below a certain age - sometimes as young as 35. The current interest in age discrimination is welcome. Ageism not only unfairly curtails individual opportunity. It will also become increasingly economically wasteful, as Europe's population ages. Older people capable of contributing to society may instead become a burden. The Eurolink report blames older people's restricted employment opportunities largely on discriminatory attitudes. Too many employers believe that old people are not up to the job. There is also a widespread belief that older people's jobs are more expendable than young people's. Although some people lose their ability and enthusiasm to work in their 50s, it is unfair to lump all older people into that category. Moreover, the idea that old people's jobs are more expendable than young people's rests on the assumption that economies have a fixed amount of work which must be rationed. This is fallacious, because in the long run more workers create more wealth which in turn creates more jobs. If people are fit, productive and want to work, age should be no bar. Instead of standard retirement ages, people should be free to agree with their employers when to retire according to their personal circumstances. Declining industries But discriminatory attitudes are not the only, or even the main, factor restricting older people's working opportunities. Take the sharp decline in employment rates among males aged 55-64 in most European Community countries during the 1980s. In the UK the rate fell by 12.2 percentage points, in Spain by 14.8 points and in France by 21.6 points. Part of the explanation is that older people are being targeted for redundancy, but there are other reasons. Older workers are disproportionately concentrated in declining industries such as steel, mining and textiles. Meanwhile, many higher-paid workers are only too glad to retire early. Provided they do so willingly, this trend should be welcomed rather than resisted. Even where older people are forced out of work against their will, it is often simplistic to point at discriminatory attitudes. Is it credible that companies are sacking masses of productive workers out of prejudice? A more plausible explanation is that institutional arrangements give them an artificial incentive to do so. Cheaper youngsters One such arrangement is the seniority system, under which older employees are commonly paid more than younger workers. As a result, it is often financially rational for companies to retire older staff and replace them with cheaper youngsters. This incentive is compounded by the structure of many company pension schemes, which require employers to fund greater entitlements for older workers. The fact that such pay-offs can often be financed tax-free makes them all the more attractive to employers. Pension schemes can undermine opportunities for older people in other ways too. If pensions are based on final salaries, employees have a strong disincentive to move to part-time work as they get older even if they would prefer phased retirement to a sudden exit from the workforce. Phased retirement is also deterred by rules in some countries that prevent people drawing pensions while working. An assault on age discrimination should certainly aim to change attitudes. But it is doubtful that altering attitudes on its own would substantially expand older people's job opportunities unless companies also had a financial interest in employing them. The best way of achieving that is through institutional changes such as making pension and retirement arrangements more flexible. This is where governments, companies and unions should focus their efforts.</p>

			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / Central Europe knocks on the Community door THE LEADERS of central Europe gather in London today for their first joint summit meeting with the European Community. All four of the prime ministers - from the Czech and Slovak republics, Hungary and Poland - head fragile coalitions and bring with them a host of domestic problems. These range from the bilateral dispute between Czechoslovakia and Hungary over Slovakia's damming of the Danube river, to nervousness about rising ethnic intolerance and conflicts and the need for EC backing to ease the strains of transition to market economies. All are likely to find that the Community, on present form, is ill-prepared to offer real help. The meeting is unfortunately timed. Proposed several months ago by Mr John Major, as head of the EC presidency, to symbolise the EC's continuing interest in the former communist countries, it finds Mr Major preoccupied with his own political survival, and, together with Mr Jacques Delors, European Commission president, deeply embroiled in the Maastricht ratification process. The 'deepening' of EC institutions enshrined in the Maastricht treaty was conceived before the collapse of Soviet power in eastern Europe opened up new perspectives for European unification. Rather than re-examine the whole concept in the light of the changed realities, the EC decided to press on with the Maastricht process. It then confirmed that it attached greater priority to admitting the economically prosperous and politically stable European Free Trade Association countries than the economically and politically fragile countries to the east and south-east of Europe. The EC has been prepared to concede only limited financial and technical assistance, and make hard-fought trade and tariff concessions in bilateral association agreements with the 'Visegrad 3' countries. They are named after the Hungarian town where the three agreed in 1990 to co-ordinate their approach to EC entry. Now Brussels is dragging its feet on similar negotiations with Romania and Bulgaria, the de facto 'second tier' of eastern Europe. In practice the limited opening up to the east has been grasped with both hands by all Visegrad 3 countries which have compensated for the collapse in Comecon trade by sharp increases in that with the EC. With their eyes on eventual Community entry, they have also diligently designed their reform legislation to be EC compatible. What the prime ministers, flanked by their finance and foreign ministers, really want is a timetable for full-fledged membership of the Community. Above all, they seek assurance that the EC takes them and their problems seriously. What they most fear is being left on the doorstep while their domestic political, economic and security problems become insoluble against a possible worst case scenario of spreading civil war in Yugoslavia and economic collapse and political chaos in the former Soviet Union.</p>

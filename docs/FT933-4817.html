			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / Thorn EMI warns on profits SHARES in Thorn EMI fell 21p to 983p yesterday after a circular to shareholders warned that profits from security and electronics would be no greater this year than last and that the group's tax rate would increase. Several analysts complained that the news came in what appeared to be a routine letter to shareholders about the sale of the group's lighting division. They said the announcement should have appeared on stock exchange screens. In the circular, posted to shareholders last Friday, Sir Colin Southgate, chairman, said current year profits from the security and electronics business would be around last year's level of Pounds 1.5m. The group announced last month that it had failed to sell the defence side of its electronics business to the General Electric Company. Sir Colin added that the effect of recent disposals, including lighting, meant that profits earned in the UK would be lower than last year. As a result, the group would incur additional unrelieved advance corporation tax and its overall tax rate would increase. He added that the music and rental divisions had started the year well and their performance should be in line with expectations. Mr Mark Finnie of NatWest Securities said that he had still not received the circular by the close of stock exchange business yesterday. He noted that SG Warburg, the group's brokers, appeared to have received the notice in good time. He said: 'It's very unlike Thorn EMI to have done this sort of thing.' Mrs Julia Pennington of Barclays de Zoete Wedd had reduced Thorn's expected full-year pre-tax profits after exceptional items to Pounds 345m from Pounds 370m. Thorn said yesterday that it had lodged the circular with the stock exchange last Friday and an announcement had been made that it was available for inspection. The group said the comments in the circular on likely profits this year were required under stock exchange rules. 'It is not an announcement we would have made in the normal course of events,' the group said.</p>

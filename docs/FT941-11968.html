			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Rise in non-member output adds to Opec woes Oil production in countries outside the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries is likely to continue to undercut Opec's market share and pricing strategy in the next two years, according to a report issued yesterday. The London-based Centre for Global Energy Studies estimated that total non-Opec production would rise by 2m barrels a day by the end of 1995. Also, it expected independent producers to capture 0.8m d of the 1.2m b/d estimated increase in world oil demand this year. It suggested that the best way for Opec members to defend their market share would be to bring additional reserves into production. But that would require private capital, as the governments of most Opec countries are under severe financial pressure. The strength of the surge in non-Opec production was highlighted by another report report released yesterday in which Edinburgh consultants Wood Mackenzie predicted that UK North Sea oil output would rise by 30 per cent this year. Recent attempts to secure the co-operation of independent producers in a co-ordinated cut in output to prop up prices have so far failed. Yesterday Mr Ali al-Baghli, the Kuwaiti oil minister, was quoted as saying that 'the main producing countries did not express readiness to co-operate, especially Britain and Norway, while Russia, Syria and Egypt expressed some readiness to respond to the Opec demand in reducing their production levels'. He told the al-Watan newspaper that there was little likelihood of an early Opec meeting to cut production.</p>

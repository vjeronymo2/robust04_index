			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Banja Luka, 24 Feb (TANJUG) -- Colonel General Ratko  Mladic, chief of staff of the army of the republic of Srpska,  said today that the opening of Tuzla airport can only be  discussed in conjunction with the opening of airports in the  Srpska republic. He added that the West is trying to deny the  Serbs their right to self-defense. "They passed their resolution  to ban flights, even for pregnant women and wounded and  exhausted people. They do not even think of opening Serb  airports, although they want to open Tuzla airport, through  which they would send vast quantities of weapons, ammunition,  and mercenaries to the Muslims," he said in an interview to  KRAJISKI VOJNIK.    "We are going to discuss Tuzla airport bilaterally as well  as  with representatives of the international community in the  context of making Banja Luka airport and other airports in the  Srpska republic operational," is his categorical message in the  interview which the magazine of the 1st Krajina Corps will  publish toward the end of this week.    In his words, the West "will do many things although they do  not need Tuzla airport since they are already successfully using  the airport in Ancona, Frankfurt, and so forth. Every day and  night they are airdropping everything the Muslims need. They  are delivering the same things through all kinds of convoys."    In Mladic's opinion, the West will take advantage of the  fabricated problem of Tuzla airport in order to bring pressure  to bear on Serb policies, the Serb people, and their army.    "The West is implementing its plan for dismantling the  former  Yugoslavia and crushing the resistance of our people in various  ways, devised in protracted wars in Africa, Asia, and other  continents."    Mladic is of the opinion that the West believes in its own  mission of arranging the world in line with its criteria. If  what they have done thus far is anything to go by, we can expect  new threats, he said.    Asked about the NATO ultimatum, he said that there is a  great  deal of manipulation surrounding this word: "At a meeting with  General Jean Cot I saw NATO's decision. It does not mention the  word ultimatum. Nor is it addressed to the Serb side alone ...  NATO had no reason to take such decisions or to issue ultimata  to the Serb side because the Serb people have not declared war  on anyone, because the Serb people are conducting this war in  the same way they conducted previous wars -- following a  declaration of war by our previous neighbors under the  conductor's baton of their sponsors among the ranks of German  and Islamic countries."    "I believe that the West has not `learned a lesson from its  disgrace' in saying that a state that was a founding member of  the United Nations no longer exists and that its external  borders are no longer valid, which denies the Serb people's  right to have its own state, although it had a state long before  those who are now deciding our fate."    Speaking about having placed the Serb artillery under UN  control, General Mladic stressed that the Serb side has again  displayed a maximum of understanding to find a solution to the  crisis in a peaceful way within the UN Security Council.    "... Our weapons will be under UN control, which does not  mean that we will not defend ourselves if attacked. We will  defend ourselves with all means at our disposal and ... the  guarantee of our survival is not someone's will, but our force  and our unity."    Asked whether NATO air strikes against Muslim and Croat  positions are possible, Mladic replied he does not think so,  because "they cannot strike against their satellites."    "They are their extended arm," he said. "Muslims and Croats  were trained in their countries and are carrying out their tasks  in the Balkans. It is true that they started fighting between  themselves, but the West will calm them down in another way.  They have other trump cards for them."    Mladic assessed the deployment of Russian UN troops in  Sarajevo as "a significant event in the international political  arena," saying that a major power is rightly at the center of  developments.    The presence of the regular Croatian Army in former  Bosnia-Herzegovina is worrying and the situation cannot be  resolved until these forces are withdrawn outside the borders of  former Bosnia-Herzegovina, he said.    "By pursuing the disastrous Croatian Democratic Community  policy and by resurrecting the ustasha movement on the territory  of former Croatia, the Croats brought the Serb people into an  unenviable position by attacking them. But neither are the  Croat people in a better position, because on the territory of  former Bosnia-Herzegovina they live in 14 separate enclaves,  forced to fight," General Mladic concluded.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Press release from the UK Department of the Environment: </F> "Air Quality Standard for Ozone Recommended"]    [Text] An air quality standard has been recommended for  ozone in the United Kingdom, and the results of ozone monitoring  in the UK are to be made available to the public on an hourly  basis.    The recommendation has been made by the government's  Independent Expert Panel on Air Quality Standards (EPAQS),  chaired by Professor Anthony Seaton of the University of  Aberdeen Medical School, and is one in a series of standards  being recommended for pollutants.    The panel assessed available health and air quality data for  ozone and have recommended that the standard should be 50 parts  per billion as a running eight-hour average.    In their report the panel state that: "This recommendation  is  intended to reduce the exposure of the population, including  individuals who may be particularly sensitive to ozone, to  levels at which harmful effects are unlikely to occur. We  recommend that techniques for monitoring the standard are  consistent with those of the Department of the Environment's  national ozone monitoring networks.    "We recognise that this is an ambitious standard which will  need international action to be achieved. In order to monitor  progress we recommend that ozone monitoring data in the UK are  reported in terms of the number of days the standard is exceeded  at any one site per year. We note from past evidence that if  the 50 ppb [parts per billion] 8-hour running average is  exceeded on less than 10 days per year, at any one site, then  the maximum 8-hour concentration at that site is unlikely to  exceed 100 ppb, a concentration at which health effects in  healthy individuals have been clearly demonstrated."    Commenting on the panel's recommendation, Robert Atkins,  minister of Environment and Countryside said: "I am grateful for  the panel's report, which the government will consider  carefully, particularly in the context of the Framework for Air  Quality Standards outlined in the discussion paper "Improving  Air Quality," which I recently published. My Department will be  consulting with industry, environmental groups, and other bodies  on the standard.    "The Government recognises the need to take action to halt  the rise in ozone levels described in the recent report of the  Photochemical Oxidants Review Group (PORG). As ozone is an  international problem, this will require cooperation with our  neighbours in Europe. Meanwhile we already have policies in  hand to reduce emissions of the precursor pollutants which form  ozone:    -- all new petrol cars are catalyst equipped    -- a strategy was published last year for reducing by 30  percent emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCS), one of  the two precursors of ground level ozone by 1999 on a 1988 basis    -- discussions are beginning within the UNECE [United  Nations' Economic Commission for Europe] on a revision to the  Nox Protocol (the other main precursor) which was signed in 1988  and which freezes emissions in 1994 at the 1987 level. The UK  is on course to achieve this target and the Government welcomes  international discussions on the opportunities to make further  reductions."    Mr Atkins added: "I am pleased to announce that my  department  will be upgrading its air quality bulletin service to provide  hourly information on ozone to the public via CEEFAX, TELETEXT  and Freephone by the summer."  <H5>  Notes to Editors </H5>   The Expert Panel on Air Quality Standards (EPAQS) was  established following the government's commitment in the 1990  White Paper "This Common Inheritance" to set up a panel to  recommend air quality standards for the UK. It is chaired by  Professor Anthony Seaton, Head of Environmental &amp;  Occupational  Medicine at the Aberdeen University Medical School and members  include medical and air pollution experts.    The report is the second in a series which will make  recommendations for other pollutants suggested to the panel by  the government. Recommendations on carbon monoxide, 1,3  butadiene, nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide and particulates  are expected in due course.    The report is available from HMSO, ISBN 0-11-752873-0,  priced  5.95. pounds. Press Enquiries: 071 276 0929 (Out of Hours: 071  873 1966) Public Enquiry Office: 071 276 0900</p>

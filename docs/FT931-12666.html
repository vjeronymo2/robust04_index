			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / George Soros buys Berkeley Group stake SHARES in Berkeley Group jumped by 13p to 341p yesterday after it was revealed that Mr George Soros, the Hungarian-born Wall Street money manager, had built up a 3.19 per cent stake in the Surrey-based housebuilder. The Quantum Fund, an investment vehicle set up in the Netherlands Antilles by Mr Soros and advised by the New York-based Soros Fund Management, has acquired 1.84m shares in Berkeley, while Mr Soros and Lupa Family Partners have acquired an additional 114,000 shares. Soros Fund Management, which has a portfolio of more than Dollars 7bn, made more than Dollars 1bn (Pounds 660m) profit speculating against sterling on 'Black Wednesday'. The holding was revealed after it reached 3 per cent on Monday, triggering the disclosure requirements of the 1985 Companies Act. No reason was given for the investments. Berkeley already has a number of large institutional and other investors including SAAD Investments, a Saudi family investment group with a 10.37 per cent stake. Berkeley mostly builds up-market houses and has managed to weather the recession considerably better than most housebuilders having liquidated its land bank in late 1988. In the six months to October 31 it raised pre-tax profits by 27 per cent to Pounds 6.92m and increased its interim dividend by 10 per cent. Yesterday Mr Tony Pidgley, chief executive, said the investment was a surprise. 'We take it as a compliment, they are successful investors.' Observer, Page 21</p>

			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / US urges Serbs to join Bosnia peace process: Bosnian Croats and Moslems sign deal - Major pledges Pounds 12m for Sarajevo President Bill Clinton of the US urged Serbia yesterday to join the Balkan peace process as Bosnia's Croat and Moslem leaders signed an agreement creating a federation in that part of the republic not held by the Bosnian Serbs. He specifically urged the Bosnian Serbs to 'join in this effort for a wider peace. We invite and urge them to do so.' Mr John Major, the British prime minister who visited Sarajevo yesterday, also appealed to the Serbs to join the peace process. He said: 'I think we just have to continually put pressure on the Serbs to realise that it's going to be necessary to reach a political settlement, that there are no gains to be made by continuing fighting.' While in Sarajevo, Mr Major announced that Britain would provide Pounds 12m to help rebuild the city's infrastructure, of which Pounds 5m would be allotted to a joint Anglo-American civil mission to provide health care, restore the power generation system and rebuild the city's railway line. The rest would go to the UN organisations providing aid. Mr Clinton said yesterday's measures were 'only first steps but they are steps in the right direction . . . they offer one of the first clear signals that parties to this conflict are willing to end the violence and begin a process of reconstruction.' The US is pinning considerable hopes that next week Mr Vitaly Churkin, Russia's special envoy to former Yugoslavia, will be able to forge an agreement between Croatia and Serbia on the status of the Serb-held Krajina region in south-eastern Croatia. In Washington, both President Alija Izetbegovic of Bosnia and Franjo Tudjman of Croatia asked for help to rebuild their nations. Mr Clinton promised that the US would contribute and said it stood ready to act, through Nato, to help sustain any broader and enforceable peace agreement involving all three parties. But Mr Izetbegovic, considered the most reluctant party to the agreement, also said he wanted a 'fair peace', which would include the retention of Bosnia's old borders, resettlement of those expelled from their homes, and a war crimes tribunal. The agreement also laid out the principles of a confederation between the Croat parts of Bosnia and Croatia itself. This blueprint could be extended to allow the Bosnian Serbs a comparable relationship with Serbia. Serb leaders yesterday appeared in disarray over the Washington agreement, uncertain whether it heralded a pact against the Serbs, or formally sanctioned Greater Serbia and Croatia.

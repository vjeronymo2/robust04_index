			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture (Week in the Markets): Brazilians cheer up coffee market LONDON'S ROBUSTA coffee market got a shot in the arm this week when Brazil's coffee exporters announced that they had abandoned their traditional opposition to the International Coffee Organisation's export quota system. The decision, taken by representatives of 40 leading exporters meeting under the auspices of the Brazilian Coffee Exporters' Federation (Febec), echoed a vote last week by Brazilian producers calling for talks on a return to an international coffee agreement. The principle of export limitation has always, naturally enough, been anathema to the exporters. But their fundamental opposition to quotas appears now to have been outweighed by increasing concern at the growing number of Brazilian farmers who have been abandoning coffee cultivation after seeing world market prices plunge to 17-year lows following the suspension of the quota system in July 1989. 'Our absolute priority is an increase in international prices and for this Febec has to sacrifice some ideals,' commented Mr Oswaldo Aranha Neto, the federation's president. Febec's change of heart, which one Brazilian trader described as 'the demolition of the Berlin Wall of the coffee world', fuelled a rally that had begun in New York on Friday of last week. The May contract on the London futures market, which had already risen by Dollars 28 since the beginning of the week, put on another Dollars 40 on Wednesday and Thursday to reach Dollars 871 a tonne. That rise was trimmed back yesterday after the director of the Mexican Coffee Institute voiced his opposition to export quotas, but the May price still ended Dollars 42 up on balance at Dollars 845 a tonne. Cocoa futures dipped to 6 1/2 -month lows in mid-week as traders awaited news on the Ivory Coast mid-crop, which they thought might be higher than the 100,000 tonnes previously estimated. But the fall, which took the May delivery price to Pounds 660 a tonne at one stage, was reversed towards the end of the week and that position ended unchanged at Pounds 676 a tonne. At the London Metal Exchange zinc was for the first three days of the week clearly the weakest market and for the last two clearly the strongest. Prices went into retreat on Monday in reaction against the gains encouraged last week by news of further supply disruptions. The fall carried the three months price through the psychologically-important Dollars 1,200-a-tonne level, triggering stop-loss liquidation orders, and by Wednesday's close it had dipped to Dollars 1,179 a tonne, the lowest level for three weeks. That technical correction appeared, however, to have cleared the way for a fresh wave of speculative and options-based activity, which quickly triggered short-covering and stop-loss buying. The latest rise in US retail sales also encouraged the Dollars 50 rise that yesterday took three months zinc to Dollars 1,237.50 a tonne, up Dollars 26 on the week, the highest level since January last year. could rise further. 'If it manages to close above Dollars 1,230 (a tonne), I see it quickly testing resistance above Dollars 1,250,' one told Reuter yesterday morning. The only other price movements of any size this week were in the nickel and lead markets, and both were weaker. A further build-up in London Metal Exchange stocks weighed on the nickel market, which ended Dollars 180 down on the week at Dollars 7,445 in the cash position. Lead prices had made a modest advance until producer buying dried up yesterday. The cash price ended Pounds 6.25 down on the day at Pounds 297.75 a tonne, down Pounds 4 on the week. The three months aluminium price breached the Dollars 1,300-a-tonne support level on Monday as last week's downtrend was continued. But losses were recovered by the end of the week. At the London bullion market the gold price moved slowly but surely lower throughout the week. Support at the Dollars 348-a-troy-ounce level was first tested on Monday and held until Thursday morning. But lack of interest from investors, who have seen producer selling emerge repeatedly above Dollars 351 an ounce, eventually took its toll and the price closed yesterday at a six-month low of Dollars 347 a tonne, down Dollars 2.70 on the week. The platinum price was also under pressure, despite fears about unrest in South Africa, the main supplying area. Dealers attributed yesterday's Dollars 2 fall to Dollars 359 an ounce to a perception that demand was slackening in Japan, the main importer of the white metal.  ----------------------------------------------------- LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS (As at Thursday's close) tonnes  ----------------------------------------------------- Aluminium   +3,350   to   1,136,375  ----------------------------------------------------- Copper        +825   to     301,975  ----------------------------------------------------- Lead          -975   to     134,675  ----------------------------------------------------- Nickel        +846   to      24,276  ----------------------------------------------------- Zinc        -1,175   to     211,625  ----------------------------------------------------- Tin           -145   to      12,255  -----------------------------------------------------</p>

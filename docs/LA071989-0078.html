			<p><P> July 19, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> PALMDALE IS STATE'S FASTEST GROWING CITY FOR 3RD STRAIGHT YEAR  </P> <P> For the third straight year, Palmdale has been named the fastest growing of the  448 incorporated cities in California, a research group said Tuesday.  </P> <P> The survey by the Center for the Continuing Study of the California Economy, an  independent research firm in Palo Alto, showed that Palmdale grew from a  population of 17,396 in 1984 to 45,859 at the end of 1988. The city has added  about 3,000 residents since then.  </P> <P> The center said the new residents are being drawn by relatively low home prices  and the area's potential for job growth.  </P> <P> "We are getting a lot of home buyers who want more house for their money," said  Steve Buffalo, a spokesman for the city. An estimated 90% of new Palmdale home  buyers are commuters, he said.  </P> <P> The city is an hour or more from downtown Los Angeles. However, the drive can  take much longer in traffic jams.  </P> <P> Palmdale achieved the top-growth ranking based on five-year gains of 164% in  population, 169% in assessed property valuation and 115% in retail sales.  </P> <P> City officials expect Palmdale's growth to continue. During the first five  months of this year, more than $200 million worth of building permits were  issued.  </P> <P> That figure does not include a 77-acre auto mall or a 1 million-square-foot  retail shopping mall, both scheduled to open in late 1990.  </P> <P> Additionally, some jobs are coming to Palmdale. In April, as part of a  corporate restructuring, Lockheed Corp. announced that it would start  transferring about 7,000 jobs from its facilities in Burbank to Palmdale and  Santa Clarita.  </P> <P> The city of Moorpark in Ventura County was the third-fastest growing city  behind Moreno Valley in Riverside County.  </P></p>

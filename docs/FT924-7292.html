			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Low demand for tyres takes the bounce out of rubber RUBBER INDUSTRY officials see little prospect of an early bounce in the world market for the commodity, Reuter reports from Singapore 'Unless there is very strong demand, there is nothing in today's economy that is going to make you believe there is going to be a very strong immediate recovery,' says Mr Mark Blitstein, director of purchasing (commodities) at the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company, who is attending the 34th assembly of the International Rubber Study Group here. Private companies and government bodies are participating in the six-day meeting. Mr Blitstein says he expects tyre demand in the US to grow at between 3 and 5 per cent in 1993, marginally up on 1992. 'European demand for tyres will be flat at best while Japanese demand is likely to be smaller,' another delegate forecasts. Prices are showing signs of bottoming but the outlook remains clouded by world surplus, officials say. Tyre manufacturers consumed about 70 per cent of the world's natural rubber production of 5.34m tonnes in 1991. Goodyear alone consumed an estimated 400,000 tonnes.</p>

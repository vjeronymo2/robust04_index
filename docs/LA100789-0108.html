			<p><P> October 7, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHLAND AIRWAVES SPEAK TO BOOMING CHINESE POPULATION  </P> <P> A picture of a satellite spiraled across a television screen as anchor David  Huang straightened in his seat in a Rosemead studio, preparing to greet  Chinese-speaking viewers all over North America with the latest world news.  </P> <P> Delivered by satellite to audiences in the United States, Canada, Mexico and  the Caribbean, his half-hour broadcast is designed as a cornerstone of N. A.  Television Corp., the latest newcomer in Southern California's competitive  Chinese-language broadcast industry.  </P> <P> On the same day that N. A. Television made its debut last week, a new  Chinese-language radio station called Voice of Democracy also joined the  airwaves.  </P> <P> Station owner Shi Chang Chen said he has been planning to start a radio station  for two years. After the June military crackdown in Beijing, he decided to name  his station Voice of Democracy as a way of continuing the spirit of the  protesters.  </P> <P> Based in South Pasadena, the station broadcasts on an FM subcarrier frequency.  To receive its programs, listeners must buy a special radio that the station  sells for $40.  </P> <P> Both of the new broadcast companies hope to carve out a slice of Southern  California's growing Chinese market, estimated at more than 200,000 people.  </P> <P> The total could be as high as 500,000, said Rosemary Fincher Danon, general  manager of Los Angeles-based KSCI-TV Channel 18, the independent station that  leases air time to six local Chinese television broadcast companies. The  station also leases time for programs in 15 other languages, from Italian to  Farsi.  </P> <P> Counting the latest entries in the Chinese broadcast industry, there are nine  Chinese-language television companies and four radio stations in Los Angeles  alone. Many offer service programs, such as English lessons and immigration  information.  </P> <P> With the exception of Chinese Outreach, a nonprofit, Christian radio  programming group that airs no commercials during its 2-hour weekly program,  all of the broadcast firms hope to attract advertisers, who are increasingly  interested in reaching Chinese consumers.  </P> <P> "Advertisers are starting to realize the strength of this market," Danon said,  citing the Bank of America, Alpha Beta supermarkets and the California Lottery  as examples.  </P> <P> But Irene Young, general manager of Joint Art Media Corp., an Alhambra  advertising firm, said she is still reluctant to recommend that her clients  advertise on Chinese-language television or radio programs. She suggests  instead that most of them advertise in Chinese-language newspapers, which reach  about 60% of the Chinese community, she said. In comparison, Chinese broadcast  programs generally reach, at best, 35% of the community.  </P> <P> For clients who want to reach the elderly and housewives, however, Young said  that television and radio may work well. Those two groups of viewers often  watch Chinese-language television, now available on Channel 18 from noon to 3  p.m. and other time slots scattered through the day and night, she said.  </P> <P> In the competitive Chinese-language television market, N. A. Television is the  first to utilize satellite transmission, enabling it to reach audiences outside  of metropolitan areas, said Jesse Hsiao, secretary of the board.  </P> <P> But unlike programs on Channel 18, which viewers from Ventura to San Diego  counties can watch free, the satellite programs can only be received through a  miniature satellite dish and special receiver that together sell for $499. The  dish weighs barely 25 pounds and is no wider than a card table.  </P> <P> Dubbed "Little Ear," the dish is popular in Taiwan, where it gained acceptance  during the 1988 Olympics. Viewers wanting more complete coverage of the games  used them to receive Japanese television coverage from Seoul.  </P> <P> Including tax, shipping and installation, viewers would incur a one-time cost  of $600 to $700 for the satellite service, said Sandy Hsueh, a spokeswoman for  North America Telecommunication Corp., a Rosemead company that works with  satellite dish distributors.  </P> <P> By turning a dial, "Little Ear" viewers can hear programs in either Cantonese  or Mandarin Chinese.  </P> <P> But Channel 18's Danon said she does not feel threatened by competition from  the satellite television company. She said that paid Chinese-language programs,  such as those offered on Choice Cable's Jade channel, have never hurt business  for producers who air Chinese programs on her station.  </P> <P> "Free over-the-air programming is always going to have its place," she said.  </P> <P> Still in a "test broadcasting" period, during which it offers just 2 hours of  programming a night, N. A. Television is trying to iron out glitches in its  programs before its formal launch in January, 1990. In addition to soap operas  and variety shows produced in Hong Kong or Taiwan, the company will offer  locally produced news and "magazine style" shows, and is in the process of  fine-tuning those programs.  </P> <P> The first magazine show to air last week introduced viewers to Muscle Beach and  dancing skaters in Venice. News broadcasts feature CNN clips and film reports  flown in from Taiwan, China and Hong Kong.  </P> <P> Hsiao said the company is trying to speed up its news service even more in  order to satisfy viewer demand for up-to-date information.  </P> <P> Competition among the Chinese-language broadcast stations centers on the news  programs because that's what most viewers and listeners, especially those who  cannot understand English-language news, want.  </P> <P> With that in mind, Voice of Democracy is emphasizing speedy news coverage by  having correspondents in Hong Kong and Taiwan call in at least twice a day with  breaking news. Other reports are sent by facsimile machine and are read by news  announcers at the South Pasadena studio.  </P> <P> "It makes me feel like I'm reporting breaking news," said Perry Ni, a popular  television personality from Taiwan who works as a disc jockey and talk show  host at Voice of Democracy. He said that at other stations he has worked for,  news announcers simply read newspaper reports, which most listeners probably  had read.  </P></p>

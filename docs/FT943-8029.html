			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / VW back to black in quarter Volkswagen, Germany's biggest vehicle group, returned to profit in the second quarter, attributing the improvement to restructuring and higher sales. Net profit reached DM133m (Pounds 55m) after a DM342m loss in the first three months. As a result, the first-half deficit was reduced to DM209m from DM1.6bn - which included huge rationalisation costs. Forecasting a slow revival in demand and more benefits to come from cost-cutting, VW said yesterday it expected to break even for the full year. In 1993 it lost DM1.9bn. According to yesterday's report, the number of vehicles shipped to dealers rose 8.5 per cent to 1.6m in the first half, and deliveries to customers increased 7.8 per cent to 1.73m. Customer sales in Germany fell 3.9 per cent, slightly reducing the group's market share to 29 per cent, however this was offset by a 7.5 per cent rise elsewhere in western Europe - where new car registrations rose 6.6 per cent in the first seven months of the year, according to industry estimates. VW showed a 2 per cent overall increase in the region and a decline in market share from 16.9 to 16.5 per cent. Group turnover for the first half was up 6.4 per cent at DM40.8bn while the German parent's sales slipped 4 per cent to DM21bn. German production fell 1 per cent to 698,000 units, but output from foreign factories jumped 8.2 per cent to 862,000. This surge included a 19 per cent rise at Seat, the recently rescued Spanish subsidiary which was blamed for most of last year's losses. Customer sales of Seat vehicles increased 23 per cent. Sales in China, the group's main developing market, rose 14 per cent to 73,500, while south America and South Africa together recorded a 32 per cent advance to 272,000. The group's workforce of 241,000 at the end of June had fallen 4 per cent in 12 months. Analysts said the results were better than expected and showed that savings on labour and material costs were coming through. Mr Stephen Reitman, at UBS in London, said gross margins of 9.8 per cent in the first half were VW's best for three years. He forecast a modest profit for the full year. Lex, Page 14</p>

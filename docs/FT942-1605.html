			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / International Company News: Aer Lingus lays off 850 staff as dispute continues Team Aer Lingus, the aircraft maintenance division of Aer Lingus, the Irish state airline, yesterday laid off more than 40 per cent of its workforce, amounting to 850 of its 2,000 employees, as trade unions warned that the dispute over pay and staffing cuts could spread through the whole airline. The division has been losing IPounds 1m (Pounds 980,000) a month and currently has no heavy maintenance contracts as airlines have transferred business elsewhere over concerns that the simmering dispute would leave their air-craft stranded in Aer Lingus maintenance hangars. Earlier this week craft unions rejected a rescue package for the subsidiary recommended by the Labour Relations Court, arguing that their own proposals to return the company to commercial viability had not been considered by the management or the LRC. The LRC recommended a pay freeze until July 1996, rather than pay cuts sought by the management. Backbenchers of the Labour party, which forms part of the coalition government, yesterday criticised Aer Lingus for its handling of the dispute. The government, however, has backed the management and recommended acceptance of the LRC proposals. Senior politicians are to question Aer Lingus today on the dispute in a special Dail sub-committee hearing convened at the request of the unions. Mr Dennis Smith, chief negotiator for the craft unions, said that strike action was not planned for the time being, but Siptu, one of the trade unions involved in the dispute, said yesterday that if non-union labour was taken on while staff were laid off 'there certainly will be a reaction'. The government and Aer Lingus are meanwhile facing pressure from another direction. Aeroflot, the Russian airline, is to begin non-stop flights from Russia to the US this summer as new long-range aircraft come into service, bypassing the refuelling stop at Shannon in the west of Ireland. It has offered to continue the Shannon stopover if passengers from other CIS airlines can transfer to Aeroflot there. But the government and Aer Lingus are opposed to this as it is seen as a threat to Aer Lingus' transatlantic business.</p>

			<p>940910 FT  10 SEP 94 / Fashion: Suit yourself carefully in your first job - A sober working environment is simply no place for making fashion statements You have landed your first job. Day one in the office looms. Your wardrobe seems to consist of little more than jeans and sweatshirts. What on earth do you do? No matter how fashionable you may be in your private life the sad truth is that if you are starting work in a sober city or business environment it is not a time for fashion statements. Greys, blacks and blues set the tone in business and conservative suits rule the day. No, this is not some youthful homage to prime minister John Major but the realities of the need for no- fuss, simple clothing on the first rung of the career ladder. Simplicity is the key and a crisp, efficient appearance will compensate for fashion fripperies and style statements. 'If you're serious about your first job you do not wear clothes that will attract too much attention,' says Stephen Ibrahim, men's tailoring expert at Simpsons of Piccadilly. Flashy shows of individuality would create the wrong impression to those higher up as well as to your peers and perhaps promote resentment. Few companies issue strict guidelines but most expect an unwritten dress code to be followed. The more successful you become the more flamboyant and noticeable your clothes are allowed to be. Bold chalk stripes and vivid pink shirts are not for the new boy on the block. Expensive Chanel earrings and flame-red suits are reserved for high-flying women who have made it already. The golden rule is: do not dress above your station. Brassy shows of aspiration are considered vulgar (although the older hands are excused). Your work must seem to come first, not your image. Even Lowri Turner, an outspoken television fashion critic, advocates the subdued look for that first, probationary year - 'neither too severe nor too sexy', says she, who has progressed from a raincoat and pumps to her current dressed-for-success image in spiky Manolo Blahnik heels and Calvin Klein suit. 'But there is no need to look boring,' says Turner. 'We all want to look good.' And this can be done if the style is kept subdued. One tip, if a restricted dress code operates, is to spend as much as you can afford on your first sober suit. Good cut and fabric really matter - they last longer and look better. Susie Faux, who has built a name as the working woman's sartorial psychologist, and is the owner of Wardrobe, a fashion consultancy, feels strongly that the most important thing is to 'love your suit' - not only will you be seeing a lot of it but this will give you tremendous confidence'. Although all this may seem a bit like reverting to school uniform, it is not as grim as it sounds - and there is no need to look dowdy. Just as chaps should avoid, at least to begin with, shirts with stripes, so women should beware of loudly-striped suits. At the next stage of your career, you could introduce stripes as well as bold, colourful ties and, for women, scarves and more expensive jewellery. Grey outfits often look better than navy. Inexpensive navy clothes often tend to become shiny more quickly. Remember this suit should take you from your first interview to your first pay rise. For men's suits, medium 13oz hard-wearing hopsack is best. Single-breasted, three-buttoned jackets can introduce an acceptable fashion element and flat-fronted trousers are flattering to a youthful frame. If you prefer double-breasted jackets choose the traditional six-button/two-fastening combination, which is more classic than the continental-style single-fastening as this can hint at a wide-boy, 1980s-salesman, style. Women's suits, although they should be dark, can be more adventurous with fabric, textures and weave. If you cannot afford a really good suit, try and spend as much as you can on a quality jacket and team it with a cheaper black skirt or some good chain-store trousers (Marks and Spencer usually has excellent ones). Skirts should not be too short and, in most city offices long ones are frowned upon. The best length for the moment is a couple of inches above the knee. A mid-sized heel is good for women's shoes which must have the minimum of detailing. For the men, Lowri Turner thinks they should invest in one pair of well-made shoes. 'A good pair of Church's will see you through to promotion and beyond.' Plain brogues or Oxfords seem to be the only choices  -certainly no loafers and, of course, they should, above all, be immaculately clean. Once you have chosen your suit, think about your appearance. Clean-cut and groomed is how employers prefer it. Susie Faux thinks a good hair cut is where it all begins and advocates regular manicures for both men and women. When it comes to make-up she thankfully excludes men but believes women must use the right amount: 'Not too much - but they must use some.' Soon the days of the first and only suit will be behind you as you head for the Versace ties and your skirt can be as sexy as you like. After all, when you are the boss, anything goes. To find affordable ranges of 'first suits' for men and women it is worth looking at smaller department stores, such as Kendal Milne in Manchester or Dickins &amp; Jones in London, and specialist shops, such as the Norton Barrie chain of shops in Northern England (mainly men) or, if you can persuade a parent or godparent to fund it, Wardrobe in Brook Street, London, W1. For a slightly less attentive service, but with suits that are good value, chain stores Next, M&amp;S and Principles have intermittently excellent ranges while on the slightly more expensive side Jaeger, Austin Reed, Hackett and Daks Simpsons offer mid-range suits that are true investments in your career. Other shops to check out are Jigsaw, Whistles and Selfridges and Dorothy Perkins which has invested heavily in upgrading the design content without pushing up the prices.</p>

			<p><P> October 5, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HEARTY MOROCCAN CASSEROLE FOR ADULTS CAN TOP HALLOWEEN PARTY MENU;  </P> <P> FINGER FOODS WILL KEEP THE SMALL FRY HAPPY  </P> <P> Each year, more people become disenchanted with the Halloween celebration. What  was once a time of carefree mischief for children and adults alike has become a  time for vicious pranksters to play dangerous tricks on youngsters.  </P> <P> Today, the Halloween celebration needs an all-new game plan, and parties at  home offer the most fun and the best sense of security. This year, invite a few  couples to stop by after they've escorted their children on an early  neighborhood trick-or-treat prowl.  </P> <P> Or plan a celebration to which children can also be invited. Plan a simple  box-lunch-type meal for them featuring a variety of finger foods, then set  aside an area for them to play indoor games. They can even dispense goodies to  trick-or-treaters ringing the doorbell. Once the children are safe and content,  there's no reason why adults can't enjoy the fun of the day.  </P> <P> Treat the adults to an easy-to-prepare yet sophisticated meal -- a hearty  Moroccan-inspired casserole of lamb, sausage, prunes and sweet potatoes  flavored with honey and cranberries. Instead of pumpkin pie, make a pumpkin  brulee and top it with ginger-flavored cranberry sauce. The brulee is cooling  and refreshing, just what's called for after a spicy main course.  </P> <P> LAMB-SAUSAGE TAJINE  </P> <P> 6 Italian sausages  </P> <P> 4 pounds whole small lamb shanks  </P> <P> 3 tablespoons oil  </P> <P> 1 large carrot, peeled and finely chopped  </P> <P> 1 stalk celery, finely chopped  </P> <P> 2 medium onions, peeled and coarsely chopped  </P> <P> 1 1/2 teaspoons salt  </P> <P> 1/2 teaspoon black pepper  </P> <P> 1/2 teaspoon turmeric  </P> <P> 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger  </P> <P> 1/2 teaspoon ground coriander  </P> <P> 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin  </P> <P> 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon  </P> <P> 4 cups drained, peeled and diced tomatoes in juice  </P> <P> 1/4 cup beef stock  </P> <P> 1 1/2 pounds sweet potatoes  </P> <P> 1/4 cup honey  </P> <P> 1 1/2 cups cranberries  </P> <P> 6 ounces whole pitted prunes  </P> <P> 1/4 cup chopped parsley  </P> <P> Pierce sausage and place in saucepan.

Heat oil in large  casserole. Brown lamb on all sides and remove.  </P> <P> In same pan, lightly brown sausages on all sides. Remove sausages and drain fat  from casserole, leaving film of oil in pan. Add carrot and celery and saute 3  minutes. Add onions and cook 3 minutes longer or until barely wilted.  </P> <P> Return lamb and sausages to casserole. Sprinkle with salt. Cover and cook 15  minutes over low heat. Uncover and stir in pepper turmeric, ginger, coriander,  cumin and cinnamon. Then add tomatoes and stock. Cover and cook over low heat  45 minutes.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, peel sweet potatoes and cut into 1/2-inch slices or lengthwise  strips, dropping into salted water as you go to prevent discoloring. Remove  casserole lid and add honey, cranberries, prunes and sweet potatoes. Return lid  to casserole and simmer 30 minutes or until meat and potatoes are tender. (If  juices seem too thin, drain off and boil down until thickened. Pour back over  casserole before serving.)  </P> <P> Transfer tajine to serving dish or to prebaked pumpkin or squash that is heated  if desired, or serve from casserole. Sprinkle with parsley.

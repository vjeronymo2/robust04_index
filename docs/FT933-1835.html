			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / Farmers predict smaller harvest THE NATIONAL Farmers' Union yesterday predicted a fall of nearly 12 per cent in this year's grain harvest to 19.5m tonnes. The union blamed bad weather conditions during planting and the effects of Common Agricultural Policy reforms, notably the requirement that arable farmers must leave part of their land fallow to qualify for compensation for cuts in European Community support prices. Mr David Naish, union president, said: 'Apart from climatic factors, British farmers are having to adjust their businesses to take account of the three-year CAP reform package agreed by EC agriculture ministers last year and this is obviously having a significant effect on the way their land is farmed.' The Ministry of Agriculture announced yesterday that the total area planted with cereals had fallen by 13 per cent to 3m hectares this year, the first year of CAP set-aside. The wheat area was down 15 per cent and barley down 10 per cent. Last week Dalgety Agriculture estimated a much bigger grain harvest of 20.9m tonnes. Predictions vary each year, and Dalgety calculates its yields per hectare in a different way to the union, giving a higher figure for wheat. The union's arable crops survey estimated a 1m-tonne drop in the wheat harvest to 13.1m tonnes in spite of a 9 per cent increase in yields. It expected the barley crop to fall from 7.4m tonnes to 5.9m tonnes. The agriculture ministry's figure for the total harvest last year, which was a poor one for cereals, was 22.1m tonnes. The 1991 harvest was 22.6m tonnes.</p>

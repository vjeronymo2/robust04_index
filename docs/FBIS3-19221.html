			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Hannover (DPA) -- According to preliminary  calculations, Deutsche Bundespost Telekom (Bonn) increased its  sales by 8.3 percent to 58.5 billion German marks [DM] in 1993.  "All our various branches contributed to this gratifying growth  rate," Helmut Ricke, chairman of the board of directors, said in  Hannover on Monday [14 March]. "According to the currently  available figures, we have before-tax revenues of more than DM5  billion, which is fully passed on to the Federal Government."  Upon inquiry by DPA, it was said that there "will certainly not  be any profit" shown in the balance sheet. One can once again  expect compensation payment to the sister companies, but one  cannot yet say anything about that.    For 1994 Telekom expects another increase in sales by 8  percent to DM63 billion. By the year 2000 business is to be  expanded to DM80 billion and the number of employees is to be  reduced by 30,000 to about 200,000. This year 3,500 employees  are to be dismissed, which will increase productivity.    Four years before the end of the telephone monopoly, Ricke  drew up a positive interim balance sheet: "We have made a lot  of progress on the path from an authority to a market- and  customer-oriented company." The number of telephone hook-ups  rose from 35.4 million to about 37 million last year. The  number of cable hook-ups rose from 11.8 million in 1992 to 13.5  million in 1993. Regarding the use of ISDN [integrated services  digital network] networks, Telekom "occupies first place  internationally," Ricke said. The number of channels, with  which language as well as text and pictures can be transmitted  in one network, has almost doubled from 600,000 to more than 1  million in 1993.    By the turn of the century Telekom plans to have all analog  systems replaced with digital ones. The exchange will be  concluded six years earlier than planned. The average Telekom  customer need not expect any price increases. Telekom plans to  enter the Asian-Pacific market with representations in Singapore  and Beijing. The transformation into a shareholding company  will probably be postponed by four months to January 1995,  according to Ricke. In 1996 at the latest Telekom wants to go  to the stock exchange.</p>

			<p>921231 FT  31 DEC 92 / Satellite dish total estimated below 2m SATELLITE DISH ownership in Britain was below 2m at the end of October, according to estimates by GfK Marketing Services, the market research group. This compares with the 2.61m total produced by Continental Research, which conducts monthly research for the FT Satellite Monitor. GfK says its figures are consistent with those produced by Barb, which produces official ratings for the BBC and ITV. GfK Marketing Services, a subsidiary of German market research group GfK Holding, plans to produce a monthly satellite monitor sponsored by the ITV Association. The company says that between June and October the net total for new satellite dishes was about 187,000. Its figures are derived from a sample of 10,000 homes in June, updated by monitoring new installations through electrical multiples, electricity boards, rental specialists, department stores and mail-order groups. Continental's research is based on interviews with more than 4,000 adults each month integrated with retail figures.</p>

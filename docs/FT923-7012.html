			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / Stagnating Germany fearful of recession: Frankfurt's stock market hits new low as unemployment continues to increase AS the Frankfurt stock market index fell 8.5 points yesterday, posting a new low for the year, the Baden-Wurttemberg town of Gosheim lost 49 jobs. Mr Hubert Hermle, boss of machine tool maker Berthold Hermle and paymaster to 749 people, says his order book is 42 per cent lower than a year ago. First-half sales have dropped 22 per cent. The whole works is being put on short-time until the end of the year, and 49 workers will have to go. It seems insignificant compared to the 6,000 workforce reduction by the computer group, Siemens-Nixdorf, or the 89 per cent profits fall of engineering giant Mannesmann, but Mr Hermle's sorry report is only one of hundreds of similar cases over the past few months. The main elements of the picture have been clear since the spring, when Volkswagen said it planned to shed 12,500 workers over five years. Then came Mercedes-Benz announcing 20,000 job losses, Porsche 850, and Hoesch, BMW and Grundig with 3,000 each. After nine years of rapid, uninterrupted growth - more than 3m new jobs have been created since 1983 - the western German labour market has stopped expanding. Suspicions of stagnation, which stirred in the second half of last year have been confirmed and are turning to fears of a downturn. The slimming-down process, has gathered pace. Gloomy profit forecasts have turned into even gloomier results among virtually all large groups, and the process has spread through the whole of industry. Unemployment matches the 1988 level at 1.8m or 6 per cent. Unemployment in the engineering and electronics industries is 13 per cent. Almost 250,000 people are on short-time work. Continuing international recession, virtual stagnation at home, cramped public spending, falling consumer confidence, high interest rates and wages costs are all taking their toll. As the Westdeutsche Landesbank said in its latest report: 'In recent months economic development has been moving above all in one direction: downwards and on a wide front'. The one variable currently within the control of industry is the payroll. Managers who took on thousands of new workers on the strength of the unification boom, agreed inflationary wage demands in 1990 and 1991 for fear of losing output through strikes, and even this year granted an average 6 per cent plus increase, but they are now making economies. The supervisory board of Lufthansa, DM542m (Pounds 192.1m) in the red in the first half, meets on August 31 to agree well-signalled job cuts and restructuring moves. But there is also the chance of the odd green shoot. A pre-emptive offer last weekend from the DAG white-collar union to accept effective wage cuts of 8 per cent for cabin and ground crew, if everyone else did the same, prompted the airline's board to cut its own pay by 10 per cent. DAG, said 'exceptional circumstances call for exceptional actions'.</p>

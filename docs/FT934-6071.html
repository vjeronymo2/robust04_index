			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / Leading Article: Welsh wizardry Government policies for economic regeneration in Wales are often hailed as a model which could be copied in England. Inward investment is one symbol of success: with just 5 per cent of the population, Wales has won around 20 per cent of jobs from investment into the UK in recent years. The unemployment rate in Wales - in the past higher than the UK average - is now slightly below the average. Yet doubts persist about the substance behind the rhetoric of achievement. A study published this week by the Government Statistical Service questions the success of the Programme for the Valleys. This initiative, launched in 1988, pumped Pounds 770m of public funds into the the south Wales valleys during its first five years. Yet manufacturing employment in the area fell by 11 per cent over the period, compared with a drop of 7 per cent across Wales. While there has been a small improvement in the unemployment rate, it is only marginally greater than for Wales as a whole. It may be that it is too soon to reach a judgment on what is inevitably a long-term process. The initiative has achieved a good record in land reclamation, with most derelict land now cleared. Considerable improvements have been made in infrastructure such as roads and industrial buildings. Without the additional 5,000 jobs in overseas-owned manufacturing plants created in the first five years of the initiative, the area would have fared much worse. Yet for all the flow of public money, the economy of the valleys has done little better than the rest of Wales. Wednesday's is the third official report in three years to raise doubts about government regeneration policies in Wales. In 1991, the National Audit Office criticised the government's failure to calculate accurately the returns on public investment in job-creation. In 347 projects approved in 1984-85, 16,745 jobs had been created, compared with a forecast of 25,715. While the aim was to use government funds to lever in between three and eight times as much in private investment, the NAO found that the figure was closer to 1.7 times. More recently, there has been embarrassing criticism of the Welsh Development Agency, the government's economic regeneration arm in Wales. A Commons committee accused it of wasting public money on redundancy payments and an unsuccessful project to consider possible privatisation. Economic regeneration undoubtedly needs public funds if the private sector is to be attracted back into areas such as the Welsh valleys. But costs and benefits must be analysed openly and accurately to ensure that limited resources are deployed effectively. Lord Walker, the Welsh secretary between 1987 and 1990 who launched the Programme for the Valleys, would do well to remember this in his new job as as chairman of English Partnerships, the government's urban regeneration agency for England.</p>

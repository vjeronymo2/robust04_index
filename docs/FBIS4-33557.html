			<p>BFN     [Text] Here is our opinion. A second 1915 is threatening  the country. What must we do? When the U.S. Marines landed in  Haiti on 28 July 1915, most Haitians in the cities refused to  understand. They were always sounding bugles, shouting freedom  or death. They were always swearing that they would not let  foreigners take the country of Dessalines again. But  unfortunately, words are something and the decisions we make are  something else. On 28 July 1915, there were Haitians who were  impatiently awaiting the Americans .    As in 1915, so it is today in 1994. That is 79 years of  humiliation, mourning, torture against inhabitants in both the  cities and the countryside. The dirty Haitian bourgeoisie has  joined with a coarse, criminal Army to annihilate all the  Haitian people and to help the Americans land again -- to weigh  us down even more within the logic of the coup d'etat and the  protection the Americans have sworn to provide as a reward to  all the criminals who helped it stage the coup d'etat. There  were Haitians who welcomed the Yankees in 1915 because they  would bring industry, and consequently, the country's economy  would progress.    Today, in 1994, considering the U.S. plan for the Caribbean  region within the framework of the New World Order, will the  Americans be bringing industries and progress? If we closely  examine what is going on today, we will realize that the Haitian  situation is a real headache for the U.S. Government. Haiti is  one of the most problematic countries in the region. Imperialism  took many chances with all its previous governments, before the  government of Titide Aristide. Nothing ever worked. All the  money that was invested in development projects to prepare Haiti  to enter the New World Order has vanished because most of that  money was misused by dictators while the country remains  underdeveloped despite the fact that the Americans felt they  could cooperate with those outdated, bloodthirsty, and  dictatorial governments that were previously in power in Haiti.    Regarding Aristide, despite all the mistakes his government  might have made, President Titide appeared as one of the most  honest governments that ever led the country. But the Americans  did not agree with this government's social project. So they  dismissed it. It therefore looks more necessary for the United  States to stage another military intervention in order to  integrate the country into the framework of the New World Order,  but without President Aristide. We are not talking about the  [words indistinct] the 1915 seashore businessmen who always  pretended to love Haitians, but who were always sucking the  people's blood for advantages from foreign countries, their home  countries.    All these things show how forgetful we are. Why should we  believe the United States would like us more than this Army of  zenglendos and the bourgeoisie? Why would the United States be  interested in coming to help us in 1994 when we consider that it  prevented us from seeing the color of true democracy, which the  entire Haitian people wanted to establish through the 16  December 1990 elections? What would prompt the United States,  which refused to acknowledge our independence until the year  1895, to try to remove us from the sufferings we are  experiencing now in 1994? If Haitians today think that another  U.S. intervention will help us, it is also because we have tried  to become conscious so we can really feel what is going on now  in our little country.    As early as 1898, during the war between Cuba and Spain, the  U.S. Government began a gruesome game in the Caribbean Sea.  Marines landed for the slightest reason. Americans were  conquering. Cuba, Panama, Nicaragua, and the Dominican Republic  were under their law. They were all being kicked. They were all  working hard for the well-being of U.S. people, for the  advantages of U.S. imperialism. Even recently, in the year 1990,  after the Cold War period, after the disappearance of the  eastern bloc, the Americans landed in Iraq and killed people to  defend their own interests. Besides, what would prevent them  from doing that because they are king everywhere, they are the  policeman of the world. Despite all this and all that we do not  say, we do not understand why we refuse to be cautious. We will  end this talk here for today. Let us think, because once again,  our lives are threatened.</p>

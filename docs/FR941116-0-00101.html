			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Given the initial success of experiments with birch regeneration, it was concluded that additional populations could be established and that they could be self-sustaining given periodic disturbance. In preparation for planting of seedlings, 20 small (0.1 hectare) (.3 acre) openings were cleared in wooded areas within the Cressy Creek watershed in locations where sweet birch was abundant. Seeds were collected from six round-leaf birch mother trees and four sweet birch mother trees, germinated in greenhouse conditions, and held in cultivation for two to three growing seasons before transplanting to the cleared areas in 1984 and 1985. Additional seeds were germinated in 1985 for transplanting in 1986 and 1987.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Five populations per year were established over the 4-year period, for a total of 20 populations, with the hope that a minimum of 10 populations would be self-sustaining. Each newly-established population consisted of 96 individuals, including both round-leaf and sweet birch progeny. Habitat management to promote the establishment of these populations included fencing trees from browsers, removing competing vegetation around individual transplants, and removing competing vegetation from the forests bordering the populations. As of May 1992, survival averaged 77.5% for all populations regardless of the mother tree species, and ranged from 7.2% to 96.9% (Sharik  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  1990). On this basis, 19 of the additional populations offer the possibility of self-maintenance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Retention of round-leaf germplasm began in 1975 when the U.S. National Arboretum transplanted three seedlings from the wild to their grounds in Washington, D.C. Approximately 50 plants were produced from the 3 genotypes; these plants were distributed to arboreta, botanical gardens, and nurseries in the United States and 2 European countries (Sharik  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  1990). In 1988, approximately 2,000 seedlings from crosses of selected genotypes were propagated for distribution to arboreta and botanical gardens for teaching and research. Since 1989, round-leaf birch seedlings have been distributed to other interested organizations and individuals under policy guidelines developed by the Virginia Agricultural Experiment Station. Recipients are required to cover costs and sign a waiver that they will not sell the plants or their offspring.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To increase awareness of the recovery effort and to minimize human impact on the natural population of round-leaf birch located on private property, the trees on public land have been the focus of an ongoing round-leaf birch interpretive program. A sign erected by the U.S. Forest Service gives the location of the largest round-leaf birch in the population_the Mt. Rogers Viewing Area_and a ramp provides a close-up view of the tree, which is enclosed by a chain link fence. Informational materials and guides tell the round-leaf birch story from its discovery through current recovery activities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After a decade of coordinated effort by Federal, State, and private agencies and institutions, as well as private landowners, the outlook for the Virginia round-leaf birch has brightened considerably. Because of the significant progress made toward recovery of the species and the species' current status, reclassification of the Virginia round-leaf birch to threatened status is warranted. The current status of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Betula uber <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  is described below:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Ten additional populations have been established in suitable habitat; these populations have showed an average survival rate of " 75% over a 5 to 8 year period and have reached the stage of initiating reproduction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Genotypes have been preserved through a program of sexual propagation and through maintenance of a breeding orchard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. The single natural population is extant, and there are opportunities to protect and manage its habitat.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

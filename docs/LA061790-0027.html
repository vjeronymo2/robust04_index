			<p><P> June 17, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HEAVY METAL GROUPS STRIKE A SOUR CHORD  </P> <P> Your article on the L.A. metal scene lacks a discussion of perhaps the  furthest-reaching, terrible contribution of the metal culture, namely  pay-to-play. Bob Sipchen mentions most club owners' practice of making bands  pay before granting them stage time, but fails to explain that if it were not  for those metal bands that will pay, the arrangement would not exist.  </P> <P> As a local alternative/punk fanzine editor, I am constantly made aware of the  problems of this peculiarly Los Angeles institution. I hear of $200 spent for a  15-minute slot before an audience of 30.  </P> <P> All over Southern California, bands with principle are uniting to protest and  refuse to participate in this unjust system. Bands of this sort have few places  to play as more and more clubs, knowing they can get the metal bands to pay  them, turn to pay-to-play.  </P> <P> JENNIFER SIMPSON  </P> <P> Upland  </P></p>

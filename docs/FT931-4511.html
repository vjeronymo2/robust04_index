			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / Kohl calls for G7 political backing for Yeltsin in crisis MR Helmut Kohl, the German chancellor, has written to fellow western leaders urging their support for Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, in his constitutional struggle, according to diplomats in Bonn. In particular, Mr Kohl has passed on a query from Mr Yeltsin asking for confirmation of western political support if he is forced to introduce emergency measures in Russia. The letter, sent directly to western leaders in the Group of Seven industrialised states, including US President Bill Clinton, President Francois Mitterrand of France, and Mr John Major, the British prime minister, reports Mr Yeltsin's confidence that the Russian military will support him if he seeks emergency powers, the diplomats said. It also spells out the Russian leader's determination to make one final effort at reaching agreement with the Russian parliament, while expressing some doubt about the likelihood of such a deal. The letter follows Chancellor Kohl's brief stop-over in Moscow for talks with the Russian president last week, on his way back from a two-week trip in Asia. It reflects deep German anxiety about the growing instability in Russia, and doubts about the ability of Mr Yeltsin to implement a coherent government policy during the current constitutional crisis.</p>

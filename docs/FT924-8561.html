			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / Survey of Computers in Finance (10): The dangers are growing  -Worries over breaches of security take centre stage A UK bank, coping with short staff over the Christmas holidays, recently gave a supervisor one of the two passwords needed to transfer funds overseas. The other password was stuck to the side of the personal computer the supervisor used. Within minutes he had transferred Pounds 2.5m overseas. Within hours he was on a plane, following it. This is the kind of incident computer security aims to prevent. Most breaches of security are far less glamorous. Power failure is the biggest single cause, according to a recent survey of IT security by the NCC. Poor software, not diligent hackers, is another big cause of problems. Malicious or not, risks to computer systems are increasing.  More transactions formerly made on paper are now being handled electronically. At the same time the trend to make computer use universal is increasing the number of people that can gain access and do damage to computers. The move towards distributed computing and away from centralised control on mainframe computers, adds to the hazards. 'Every time someone tags on to a network legitimately they can theoretically hack on further,' says Mr Andrew Mulholland, marketing director of BICC Information Systems and Services, a company which specialises in networking. The danger is clear. How many breaches of security have taken place in the past is less so. Banks and other financial institutions are reluctant to admit to breaches of security. In its 1991 Survey of IT Security Failures and Breaches, the NCC estimates the cost of physical security breaches such as power failures, thefts of equipment and fires, to be as much as Pounds 100m annually for finance organisations. Breaches in logical security, such as faulty software or software viruses, total at least Pounds 35m, it says. The financial community uses various techniques to protect itself against such losses. The Bankers Automated Clearing Service (Bacs), for example, is protected from unauthorised access on two levels, says Mr Cyril Bloch, managing director of Telesmart, a UK company providing software products to work with Bacs. A password generator controls access to the network, automatically creating a new password each time a user enters their pin number. The password lasts only as long as the transaction. This is combined with authentication. Users are issued a set of keys which generate an authenticator which appears at the beginning and end of each file, helping to protect the file from corruption when it is being transmitted. Files can also be encrypted so that even if someone does break into a file being transferred, the data will be in code. Another technique now gaining currency is biometrics. A biometric is a measured value which identifies a person. It could be a fingerprint, a signature or even a retinal scan which has been analysed and given a unique identifier. 'The difference between a biometric and a password is that a password can be stolen. A biometric can't,' says Mr Jim Copson, a product manager for IBM's banking business. Non repudiation has also become a feature of some systems. This allows the organisation to trace precisely via its computer system who was responsible for a particular transaction. Security is like insurance; the more an organisation has to lose from a breach of security, the more it will spend to counteract that risk. For this reason more financial organisations are looking for ways to assess their risk. Some have developed software packages which look at the various aspects of risk. The larger clearing banks who are exposed to greater risks have evolved higher levels of security. Smaller organisations with older, less well developed systems, tend to be more exposed, says Mr Clark. The trend towards the use of local area networks and distributed computing systems which take power away from the centre pose new security problems. 'We only want some of the people to have some of the information some of the time,' says BICC's Mr Mulholland. Most networks are designed to allow for maximum spread of information. To counter this, BICC advises its customers to think about information domains. Instead of sending all data all the way around a network, it should be limited to a particular group of workstations. This means creating workgroups and controlling the flow of information. 'The security of the information itself is not the only issue,' says Mr Colin Williams, marketing director of Gandalf Digital Communications, a supplier of networking equipment. 'People are realising that there is real risk in security of operation as well.' Many companies are developing standby systems to take over when the primary system fails. It may mean using services from both British Telecom and Mercury, so that if one is interrupted, the other may not be. Advances in technology tend to multiply security risks and in the rush to use them, security considerations are pushed to the rear. But some advances will also help to increase security. The use of frame relay and cell relay technologies in networks is one example. These make it more difficult to pull useful data off a network because small segments of data are routed over a network and not reassembled until they reach the end point. Similarly, as the cost of biometrics continues to fall, they will be used more widely. As electronic data exchange becomes more common, techniques such as biometrics which are now limited to banks will move into the commercial sector, says IBM's Mr Copson. But, says Mr Chris Hook, deputy principal consultant at the IT security division of the NCC. 'you can have as many passwords and encryptions as you like. They're no good if you don't keep the keys safe'.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Prime Minister Chuan Likphai yesterday hit back  at China for having rapped Bangkok over a private visit by  Taiwanese President Li Teng-hui, saying the president was not a  persona non grata and had every right to enter Thailand.  "Everybody who is not persona non grata has the right to enter  Thailand, just as the Dalai Lama has done," Chuan said his  strongest statement yet on the Taiwanese president's visit.  [passage omitted]    The prime minister said there was no agreement between  Thailand and China to bar an unofficial visit by a Taiwanese  president.    Chuan said that although Thailand holds a one-China policy  and has no diplomatic ties with Taiwan, Bangkok has the right to  negotiate with the island state over trade, economic and labour  issues. "As I have said, Thailand has a one-China policy. But  if any people like to travel to Thailand on the invitation of  the private sector, he or she can do so. Thailand and Taiwan  have trade ties, and Taiwanese businessmen are the third largest  investors here, second to Japan and the United States. We give  priority to economic ties with both Taiwan and China. Taiwan has  more investment in Thailand than China does," Chuan said.    The prime minister said Li did not come to Thailand to  discuss diplomatic or political ties, and had not met him or  Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri. [passage omitted] Chuan said  leaders of the two other Asean countries had provided reception  to Li, but the Thai prime minister had not. "So, (China) should  understand how we treat the China policy," Chuan said.    Prasong said yesterday that Li's unofficial trip to Thailand  was just a "private" visit and the Chinese Ambassador in Bangkok  would be invited for talks to clear up any misunderstanding.  "The president's visit was very much a personal affair. The  Thai government still holds a one-China policy," Prasong  insisted. If China still did not understand the point, he was  ready to explain it personally to the Chinese Ambassador.  Prasong reiterated that Thailand did not intend to change its  China policy.    He denied that the meeting between Deputy Prime minister and  Li Teng-hui was official, adding that the two did not discuss  politics or economics. "Amnuai went to see President Li in a  personal capacity, not as deputy prime minister," Prasong said.  [passage omitted]    Asked whether the visit would jeopardize progress in the  Economic Quadrangle -- a multi-lateral development between  China, Thailand, Laos, and Burma -- as charged by the opposition  Prasong said the two subjects could not be linked. "It means the  opposition doesn't know any thing about the Economic  Quadrangle," he said, without elaborating. [passage omitted]    The House Speaker, Marut Bunnak denied he had discussed  politics during a luncheon he hosted for the president at the  Central Plaza Hotel on Wednesday. "I have been in Taiwan and was  warmly welcomed. So I just wanted to show my hospitality in  return. This is just Thai tradition," Marut said.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["gb" report: "Money Market Rates Falling"] </F>   [Text] Frankfurt/Main, 27 Apr -- On Wednesday [27 April]  the German Bundesbank granted loans to the business banks at an  interest rate of 5.47 percent within the framework of its weekly  money market business. Last week, this so-called third prime  rate was still 5.58 percent. Shortly afterwards the Belgian  National Bank announced a reduction of its money market rate  from 5.7 to 5.6 percent. Experts consider it likely that over  the next few days other central banks in Europe will also  slightly reduce their interest rates.</p>

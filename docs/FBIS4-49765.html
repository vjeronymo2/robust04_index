			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 11 KYODO -- The director general of  the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) said Wednesday  [11 May] China's reentry into the multilateral trading body by  January 1995 will be a difficult task requiring firm commitments  from China and GATT contracting parties.    GATT head Peter Sutherland, attending an economic summit in  Beijing, said China's reentry would be dependent on China and  trade body members hammering out a protocol by the end of June  which can speed negotiations.    "The protocol is in effect a text of the agreement under  which the reentry will take place. It will set up the broad  terms and conditions under which China will reenter the  multilateral system," he said.    China wants to reenter GATT before January 1995, when the  Uruguay Round of agreements come into effect and GATT becomes  the World Trade Organization (WTO).    Issues regarding transparency in China's trade regime and  safeguards assuring that China will abide by GATT agreements are  needed before reentry can take place, Sutherland said.    "One needs to be satisfied that the legislative framework is  in place to provide an adequate assurance to the contracting  parties that they have security in terms of trading policy," he  said.    "Assurances need to be given that the (GATT trade) regime  will be evenhandedly applied, not merely through national  government but also at the provincial level. This is an  obligation imposed on the Chinese Government authorities," he  added.    Sutherland acknowledged the critical role of the United  States in overseeing China's reentry, saying the U.S. is  "constructively engaged" with the Chinese and there is no reason  to believe that the U.S. is "blocking" China's reentry.    He said failure for the U.S. to renew China's  most-favored-nation trading status in June would "signal  difficulties vis-a-vis the conclusion of the reentry to the  WTO," while maintaining that the issues "are not related."    Since Sutherland's arrival in China on Monday evening, the  Chinese press has viewed his visit as an assurance that China  will be allowed to enter the WTO at "an early date," preferably  as a founding member.    China was a founding member of GATT but pulled out of the  trading body after the People's Republic was founded in 1949.    The ongoing economic summit meeting has attracted many of  China's top economic and trade leaders. Featured speakers  include Sutherland, World Bank managing director Ernest Stern,  Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed and top executives  from leading multinational enterprises.</p>

"The resumption of war in Abkhazia will hardly be possible  if  the Georgian leadership takes a reasonable path," Ardzinba told  Interfax and Abkhazian television on Wednesday.    He reiterated the Abkhazian leadership's demand that a U.N.  peacekeeping force be deployed only along the Inguri River,  marking the border between Abkhazia and Georgia.    Ardzinba said the leaders of the republics and regions of  southern Russia and Abkhazia would be meeting in the Russian  city of Krasnodar early next month. He expressed gratitude to  the city's administration for organizing the meeting, which he  expected to focus, among other things, on the problem of the  border between Abkhazia and Russia.</p>

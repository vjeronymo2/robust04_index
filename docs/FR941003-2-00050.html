These indicators, which are listed below, will measure, among other things, the qualifications of the proposed staff and faculty, the institution's commitment to preparing generalist physicians, and the recruitment and retention of underrepresented minority and disadvantaged faculty, students, trainees and/or residents. These issues have been addressed in previous grant cycles as review criteria or funding factors. The review criteria and indicators were developed for the FY 1995 grant cycle with input from potential applicants for these grant programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

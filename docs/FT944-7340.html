			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / Rightwingers claim 1922 vote was rebuke to Major: Bonsor fails to oust Fox from committee leadership Rightwing Conservative MPs said last night that a show of support for a challenge to the chairman of the powerful 1922 committee of Tory backbenchers amounted to a coded rebuke to Mr John Major's leadership of the party. Sir Nicholas Bonsor, chairman of the Commons defence committee, failed to unseat Sir Marcus Fox, leader of the committee for two years. In line with normal practice, voting figures were kept secret. But rightwing critics of the prime minister said Sir Nicholas had achieved a 'respectable' level of support, reflecting widespread concern about Sir Marcus's unswerving public loyalty to Mr Major. A senior rightwinger said: 'This can justifiably be seen as a slap in the face for Major, because Marcus was seen as a close and uncritical supporter.' Sir Nicholas, a senior backbencher who is generally rightwing on economic matters but allied with the centre of the party on social issues, refrained from any criticism of the prime minister during the campaign. But his decision to stand followed attempts by Sir Marcus to put public pressure on backbenchers considering voting against the European Union finance bill, which will have its second reading on Monday. Many MPs were annoyed by Sir Marcus's forthright support for the bill, which was interpreted by many as a reversal of the normal role of the 1922 chairman in keeping Downing Street informed of backbench opinion. Sir Nicholas said there had been 'a lot' of support for his challenge, which focused on a pledge to make the prime minister more aware of backbench feelings, and to adopt a more private approach to liaison between MPs and Downing Street. 'Irrespective of the result I hope it will encourage the forging of much stronger private links between the backbenchers and the government,' he said. Sir Marcus described his victory as 'comfortable', but admitted that unease over the strength of his loyalty to the prime minister had been a key factor in the contest. Sir Marcus went on: 'I fully understand that my style is perhaps not quite the same as many of my predecessors. That is a style that I think has to adapt to circumstances. 'I am not apologising, but I am saying that during the several days of the campaign, a number of colleagues have expressed the view that I have been a little bit too upfront,' he said. The right wing of the party may have suffered a minor defeat after Mrs Marion Roe, the rightwing MP for Broxbourne, did not gain re-election to the executive of the 1922 committee. Her place was taken by Sir Fergus Montgomery, the MP for Altrincham and Sale, who has announced that he will retire from the Commons at the next election.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [First of two-part commentary by M.M. Ghaffari: "PRC-Iran: </F> Strategic Cooperation in the Future"]  <H5>  [15 Mar 94 p 4] </H5>   [Excerpts] Qian Qichen, deputy prime minister of the PRC,  who is also the foreign minister, made a regional trip and  visited Bangladesh, Maldives, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, and the  Islamic Republic of Iran. His trip to Iran was the most  significant of all and it elicited much attention from political  circles. Within the context of the PRC foreign minister's visit  to Iran, we can look at the long-standing relations between the  two countries and the trend toward broadening political and  economic relations, as the PRC Government has always had  friendly relations with Iran, even in the distant past.  [passage omitted]    Even though in recent years, cooperation between the PRC and  Iran has increased remarkably, it appears that there is greater  scope for joint economic cooperation. There is evidence of the  two countries' eagerness to expand these relations and the PRC  has focused its attention on the Islamic Republic of Iran  because it is a large and important country in the Persian Gulf,  southwest Asia and the Middle East, which can play an important  role in regional developments as a political balance.    Reciprocally, as regards its foreign policy calculations,  Iran considers the PRC a major country that is undergoing the  greatest economic prosperity of the century and one that enjoys  immense scope for maneuvering in the political arena of today.    The turmoil in the world prior to the Cold War and the  elimination of tensions generated by the end to the Cold War;  the U.S. domination in the world by a minority [as published];  and the new world order as propounded by the United States are  the various phenomena that have heightened the sensitivity of  Iran and the PRC so that the two countries have attained  unanimity through greater historical understanding and political  acumen with regard to the political developments in the region.  [passage omitted]    As regards the use of nuclear energy in Iran, the United  States has fomented tension in the region, implying that the PRC  has initiated measures to transfer technology to Iran which is  not for economic advantages but for military and political  objectives. However, regardless of the tumultuous uproar in the  world spearheaded by the United States regarding Iran's program  of peaceful and amicable utilization of nuclear energy , the PRC  continues its cooperation with Iran. What has been termed  PRC-Iranian nuclear cooperation has generated much concern on  the part of the Pentagon.    The U.S. apprehension can be viewed in the context of two  perceptions: first, remarks by Iranian officials have raised  questions about Iran's commitment to the nuclear  Non-Proliferation Treaty and second, the Middle East and the  Persian Gulf are regions in which the use of nuclear weapons  would be extremely destabilizing. However, the United States,  with its usual erroneous appraisals in foreign policy and for  reasons of security and intelligence, is not inclined to  elaborate on the nuclear issue in relation to Iran, Pakistan,  DPRK, and India.    Perhaps, according to the perceptions of the Pentagon  echelons, the presence of nuclear weapons in the Middle East can  be a useful lever and a pretext to exert pressure on these  countries at sensitive junctures. However, the vigilant nations  that have thrown off the shackles of colonialism and  exploitation are well aware that the usurpist Jerusalem regime  is the sole nuclear power in the Middle East and it even opposes  inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA]. No  Western or American government has ever protested against this  regime. However, the United States audaciously declares that  Iran's acquisition of nuclear capability may not be imminent but  the United States has its own assessment upon which it is not  willing to elaborate. It also has no reason to believe that  there is no cooperation between Iran and the PRC as regards a  military-nuclear program.    Simultaneously, the U.S. mass media launched a coordinated  propaganda program with similar reports that Iran is seeking to  gain a nuclear capability and has the benefit of the PRC's  cooperation and collaboration! The United States has constantly  used the lever of pressure on various countries so that it can  impede their paths of broadening cooperation with Iran. The  PRC, which wishes to have deep and principled relations with  Iran and in numerous cases pursues an independent policy on the  international scene, has constantly been the target of U.S.  blackmail. The United States has admitted to exerting pressure  on various countries to prevent their cooperation with Iran in  the field of nuclear technology and this is only the tip of the  iceberg.  <H5>  [16 Mar 94 p 4] </H5>   After the Islamic Revolution in Iran, the United States  directed most of its efforts toward destroying relations between  the Islamic Republic of Iran and other countries and isolating  Iran in the international arena. This can be considered an  unchangeable characteristic of U.S. policies.    Political circles have described Iran's gaining nuclear  capability as an extremely destabilizing factor in the Middle  East, adding that the report of nuclear cooperation between Iran  and the PRC is being disseminated just when those who  participated in the Madrid peace conference have been sentenced  to death! [as published] In the same vein, a U.S. nuclear  expert stated that Iran and Pakistan have crossed the line  toward the acquisition of nuclear weapons and Iraq has done a  lot of research in the nuclear field. Had it not been for the  Persian Gulf war, Iraq would have succeeded in manufacturing a  nuclear bomb.    U.S. intelligence officials have apparently reached the  conclusion that Iran is seriously and actively seeking to  produce nuclear weapons and the PRC is assisting it in this  regard. In conjunction with this clamor, THE NEW YORK TIMES  commented under the title of "Hot Oil" saying: Most of the  leaders of the Islamic Revolution are in favor of gaining access  to nuclear weapons and a cautious assessment on the part of the  intelligence sources indicates that Iran's nuclear program is  currently noncohesive and in its rudimentary stages. The PRC  has considerable capability in nuclear technology and the  Beijing authorities have officially admitted to the sale of this  technology to Iraq, Algeria, and Pakistan.    The same newspaper described Beijing-Tehran relations as  extremely cordial, adding that in the past 10-12 years, the PRC  has sold large quantities of weapons to Iran. Tokyo and Moscow  did not wish to lag behind in being affected by this rumor and  expressed concern over PRC-Iran cooperation in the nuclear  field! They stated that if the above were true they would be  forced to take appropriate measures!    It is worth mentioning that regarding social and cultural  relations as well as in its political balances, the PRC keeps  the necessary considerations in mind. This is borne out by the  fact that on the controversial issue of exporting nuclear  technology to Iran, the PRC stressed that in its exports it  firmly ensures adherence to the principles of the IAEA  [International Atomic Energy Agency], including the peaceful  utilization of nuclear technology and non-transfer to a third  country.    From this viewpoint, the PRC and Iran, within the framework  of mutual relations, have given priority to issues that are far  removed from the tension, blackmail, and instability in the  region. When the United States realizes that it is not able to  mar relations between Iran and the PRC, it will certainly seek  other chimerical pretexts for creating obstructions and damaging  relations between the two countries. In order to isolate Iran  and the PRC on the political and international level, the United  States accuses them of violation of human rights. The PRC is  charged with maltreatment of the Muslims in its northern  province of Sinkiang and of exporting nuclear technology to the  countries of southwest Asia.    Similarly, Iran is declared an opponent of the Middle East  peace trend and is accused of government-sponsored terrorism and  similar issues. Despite all this, the PRC and Iran have  displayed a high degree of restraint and openmindedness in their  foreign policy, which can be considered a principled course in  reciprocal relations.    The PRC foreign minister attended the 48th UN General  Assembly session, at which he described the old order as based  on unequal relations and explained that such an order was  anachronistic. He added that the world of the future should not  merely be geared to the interests and privileges of the greater  powers and international affairs should not be the monopoly of  the larger and stronger countries. Even though the United  States and the former Soviet Union had concurred on the  reduction of nuclear arms, the presence of a vast arsenal of  non-conventional weapons gives a different message. The policy  of force still prevails in the world and the greater countries  still exert economic pressure on all countries, thus seeking to  increase the chasm between the countries of the north and the  south.    The PRC believes that conditions should be created for the  development of the Third World countries to establish peace and  security in the world. Equality among governments in mutual  relations and non-intervention in their internal affairs is a  principle which--from the PRC perspective--should be applied to  all countries without exception. In this regard, the PRC  believes that a survey of the human rights situation should not  be permitted to tarnish the sovereignty of countries as human  rights and basic freedom of human beings should be applied  equally to all.</p>

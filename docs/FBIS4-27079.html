			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 28 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng  said here today that the overall economic situation in China is  good and that the macro-economic control measures have achieved  initial results.    Prior to his departure this morning for an official three  European nation tour that will cover Austria, Germany and  Romania, Li told the press that China's policy is to enable the  economy to develop in a sustainable, fast and healthy manner.    China has taken a series of macro-economic control measures  since June last year in a bid to curtail inflation, the Chinese  premier said. These measures included cutting back on the size  of capital construction, controlling the fast growth of  consumption funds, promoting agricultural production and the  urban vegetable basket project and tightening the control over  prices.    "These measures have yielded positive results," he said.  "The price hikes have begun to fall off over the past few  months."    Though China has not reduced the growth rate to the targeted  nine percent, he noted, it has been slowed down.    China's imports and exports have grown at a double-digit  rate, far higher than that of the national economy. "This will  no doubt contribute to the healthy development of the national  economy and China's opening up," he said.</p>

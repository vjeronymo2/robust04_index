			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / Motoring: User friendly AS I held a steady, relaxed and almost silent 200 kph (125 mph) on the rainswept autobahn in the latest VW Passat, the days when Volkswagens really were people's cars seemed a long way away. Nothing could have been more different from the five VW Beetles I owned, one after the other, in the late 1950s and 1960s, than this 174 horsepower alternative to the likes of BMW, Mercedes and, of course, Audi. Heart of the VR6 Passat is a compact new 2.8 litre engine with six cylinders set in so narrow a V-shaped block that superficially, it could be taken for a four-cylinder unit. Power delivery is as smooth as it is vigorous over a wide speed range and a catalytic converter is standard. Users should see an average fuel consumption of 28-30 miles per gallon, although not if they put two miles - or more than three kilometres - into each minute. If fuel economy and reduced pollution are more important than performance, VW offers the same cars with a 1.9 litre, 4-cylinder turbocharged diesel engine. It has a simple kind of catalyser and an exhaust gas recirculation system. So clean is it environmentally that it qualifies for the provisional German tax exemption scheme which saves buyers DM550, or about Pounds 180. The turbocharger is not fitted to boost performance. It feeds excess air into the cylinders and makes combustion so complete that particulates (microscopic bits of carbon seen as smoke) are below 0.08 of a gramme per kilometre. With only 75 horsepower, of just 10 per cent more than the naturally aspirated VW 1.9 litre diesel delivers, the environmentally friendly Passat has a fairly leisurely performance. It does not feel as lively or even quite as refined as, say, a 1.9 litre Peugeot 405 or Citroen BX turbo-diesel. But its average 44 mpg (6.4 l/100 km) makes it very economical for a roomy and solidly built 5-seat saloon. The new V6 and umwelt (environment) diesels will not arrive in Britain until VW's 1992 model year starts in the autumn. Specifications will be high. Although prices have not been finalised, the V6 saloon is expected to cost around Pounds 21,000.</p>

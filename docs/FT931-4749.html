			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / Fujitsu to cut recruitment and shake-up management FUJITSU, Japan's largest computer company, is cutting recruitment drastically and shaking up management in an effort to improve its poor performance, writes Michiyo Nakamoto in Tokyo. Fujitsu will reduce the number of new graduates it takes next year to 300 compared with the 2,200 recruits it will welcome this March. The move underlines the severity of Japan's slowdown and reflects the growing view that further cuts will be needed despite hopes of recovery soon. Fujitsu is suffering in the face of intense competition in the computer market, and desperately needs to restructure its operations. It employs 166,000. In October the company forecast a 50 per cent decline in pre-tax profits to Y20bn (Pounds 117m) on revenues of Y2,470bn but is increasingly unlikely to meet that forecast. In April the company will introduce a management assessment programme, linked to managers' bonuses.</p>

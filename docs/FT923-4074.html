			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / Sales of commercial vehicles rise 9.5% UK SALES of new commercial vehicles were 9.5 per cent higher in August compared with August last year, halting the decline that has seen the commercial vehicle sector suffer its steepest slide into recession in the post-war period. New commercial vehicle registrations rose to 31,704 from 28,946 in August 1991, according to figures from the Society of Motor and Manufacturers and Traders. This was the second monthly year-on-year increase in the last three months. The tentative sign of recovery from a very low level follows a period in which demand weakened for 32 consecutive months up to the end of May. Higher sales than a year ago were achieved in all the main sectors of the industry last month for the first time since the steep decline started in the last quarter of 1989. New truck registrations (above 3.5 tonnes gross vehicle weight) rose 7.3 per cent in August to 4,097. Sales of medium vans, such as the Ford Transit and the Volkswagen Transporter, rose 22 per cent year-on-year to 15,156. Sales of small vans, such as the Ford Escort and Vauxhall Astra car-derived vans, showed a 1.2 per cent rise, while registrations of buses and coaches rose 12.9 per cent to 184. Truck sales were higher than a year ago for the second successive month, following a year-on-year increase of 6.7 per cent in July. The truck sector has been hardest hit during the recession with sales at the lowest level since 1954. Commercial vehicle sales of 142,098 in the first eight months of the year were still 6 per cent below the very depressed level of a year ago.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------          UK COMMERCIAL VEHICLE REGISTRATIONS JANUARY-AUGUST 1992  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                               Volume   Volume     Share (%)  Share (%)                              (Units) Change (%)  Jan-Aug 92  Jan-Aug 91  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Total Market*                142,098    -6.0        100.0      100.0 Imports                       50,960    -5.3         35.9       35.6  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Small vans (up to 1.8 tonnes)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Total                         44,812    -7.5        100.0      100.0 Imports                        9,971   +15.7         22.3       17.8 Ford                          19,355    -9.3         43.2       44.1 Vauxhall (General Motors)     14,820    +9.6         33.1       27.9 Rover (British Aerospace)      3,288   -40.7          7.3       11.4 Peugeot incl.

			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / NTT moves to find access deal: Company president hopes lines issue can be settled in 10 days NTT, the Japanese tele-communications group, said yesterday it was willing to connect its domestic lines with other carriers, opening Japan's market to fresh competition. However, NTT's president, Mr Masashi Kojima, told a news conference negotiations with new carriers on cost-sharing and other issues were still needed before the lines were connected. The NTT president made his announcement a day after one of the new carriers, Japan Telecom, a competitor in the long-distance market, requested government intervention to resolve a two-year-old dispute over opening up the network NTT dom-inates for high-speed data services. Mr Kojima said he hoped the issue could be settled within about 10 days, without involving the minister of posts and telecommunications. He told journalists: 'NTT has said to all operators that its basic stance is that it is willing to connect its lines to every operator if there are such requests.' Japan's main newspapers had devoted many column inches to the dispute yesterday, with analysts saying that the dispute stemmed from NTT's monopoly of the domestic telephone network and that the lack of progress added weight to the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications' argument for breaking up NTT. 'It's useless to prolong such troubles any more,' Mr Kojima said, referring to the row with Japan Telecom. 'We hope we can settle the issue soon, possibly within 10 days, without troubling the minister of posts and telecommunications.' Mr Kojima said NTT and Japan Telecom could not agree on line connections during two years of negotiations because NTT hoped to establish broad rules on line connections, including cost-sharing, before dealing with specific demands. 'This is because we expect various demands (on line connections) from various operators, like cable television and virtual private network (VPN) operators,' Mr Kojima said. 'But we would eventually connect with them, as the world's trend is for hooking up lines with various operators. Networking companies won't survive if they move against this direction.' Since October 1992, three long-distance carriers - Japan Telecom, DDI Corp and Teleway Japan - have been trying to persuade NTT to connect their lines with NTT's local leased circuits for corporate use. The operators want to use the circuits for a new and cheaper digital data transmission service called 'frame relay services'. NTT currently monopolises the domestic telephone network, although it has the three companies competing with it in the domestic long-distance market. The status of NTT, which is majority-owned by the Finance Ministry, will be reviewed in the year starting April 1995, when a five-year law governing NTT's status is to expire. In the past 10 years, the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications has made two attempts to break up NTT but failed due to opposition from political circles.</p>

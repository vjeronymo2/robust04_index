			<p>BFN     [Text] Niamey, April 17 (AFP) -- Opposition demonstrations  here left at least one person dead and 20 injured, while police  arrested leading opposition members on Niger's first anniversary  as a democracy, a spokesman for the main opposition party MNSD  said Sunday [17 April].    The violence erupted Saturday, a day after the country's  three opposition parties, lead by the MNSD or National Movement  for the Development Society, called for civil disobedience to  protest at the marginalisation of their supporters by the  government.    Niamey Hospital said one demonstrator had died from his  injuries and a second was seriously hurt.    The MNSD spokesman said police arrested about 100 party  militants including "several influential members," among them  Karadji Ayarga and Sani Mahamane, respectively a former  government minister and former general secretary of the National  Assembly.    MNSD is Niger's former sole party. The demonstrations came  as the ruling Alliance of Forces for Change was celebrating the  first anniversary of President Mahamane Ousmane's investiture.    The worst clashes occurred near Niamey stadium between  opposition supporters and backers of the Alliance participating  in the swearing-in ceremonies, the spokesman said.    Throughout the afternoon, youths erected roadblocks of  burning tires at the city's main intersections and looted  government cars.    On Friday, in a letter sent to Ousmane, the 33 opposition  deputies (out of 83 deputies in total) threatened to form a  parallel administration if their supporters were not given 46  percent of top government jobs, a figure which corresponds to  the amount of votes won by the opposition March 27, in the  second round of presidential elections.    Government spokesman Mouctar Diallo condemned the  demonstrations Saturday and said the government would not back  down in the face of their protests.    Earlier in the week clashes between police and Islamic  fundamentalists left 10 dead in northern Niamey, while  negotiations with the rebel Tuaregs, due Friday, were postponed  yet again. Tuaregs have been fighting a war since 1971 for  recognition by the Niamey authorities of their rights and a  share in the wealth derived from their uranium-rich traditional  lands.</p>

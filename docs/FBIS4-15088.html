			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Correspondent Cristian Nita report from Chisinau] </F>   [Text] Esteemed listeners, I previously predicted that it  was possible that today Prime Minister Andrei Sangheli would  present the list of new government members; this has indeed  happened.    In today's meeting of the Moldovan Parliament, after he had  reviewed the activity of the old government, Prime Minister  Sangheli presented the list that includes the names of the new  executive members. This list includes 22 persons, compared with  the 32 persons that formed the old government. Among the  ministers who were kept in office are the following: Pavel  Creanga, minister of national defense; Constantin Antoci,  minister of interior; Vasile Calmoi, minister of state security;  and Vitalie Gorincioi, minister of agriculture.    Among the new members of the government I will mention the  following: Mihai Popov, minister of foreign affairs; Valeriu  Chitan, minister of finance; Valeriu Bobutac, minister of  national economy; Grigore Triboi, minister of industries; and  Vasile Sturza, minister of justice.    I should also mention that the new governmental structure  includes 17 ministries and eight state departments, compared to  20 ministries and 11 state departments in the old structure.</p>

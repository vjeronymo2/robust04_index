			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 12 May (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--News from  the China State Information Center indicates that the State  Structural Reform Commission is drafting a program for  transferring state-owned enterprises' property rights in order  to standardize the practice of property rights transfer.    The individual revealed that the central government is  encouraging small state-owned enterprises to transfer their  property rights and affirmed that there are no ideological  obstacles, even to the transfer of large and medium state-owned  enterprises' property rights. Because China's economic  construction is suffering a serious capital shortage, the income  from transferring property rights will be used in urgent and  important sectors of the national economy. Therefore, state  asset losses will not be a problem as property rights are  transferred; on the contrary, the transformation of tangible  assets into monetary assets will be quite beneficial to an  industrial adjustment.    An expert pointed out that the following merits attention in  any discussion of property rights transfer: State assets should  be scientifically and correctly appraised; payments should be  made in a lump and no installments are allowed; asset ownership  should be clearly defined; and, after an enterprise transfers  its property rights, overall arrangements should be made for its  staff members' and workers' employment and labor insurance and  the pensions of its retired personnel.</p>

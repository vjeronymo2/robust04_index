"It will encourage the more efficient enterprises to  establish a modern enterprise system while eliminating those  with backward operations and those in the red," he said.    Shanghai, China's leading industrial center, will establish  10 key enterprises which are expected to take over the  management authority of state-owned assets from the state on a  trial basis this year; select 10 enterprises to try out the  modern enterprise system; and help 600 enterprises, accounting  for two-thirds of the total state enterprises in the city, to  shift their operational mechanism.    In addition, it will make an inventory of the stockpiles and  capital of enterprises and create conditions for them to shift  steadily to the modern enterprise system.    According to the official, 1994 is a key year for China to  reform its taxation, banking, investment and planning systems  and state- owned assets, and accelerate the establishment of a  socialist market economy.</p>

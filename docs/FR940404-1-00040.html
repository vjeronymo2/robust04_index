Public comment on the current rules and operational experience with them have indicated the need to revise the current requirements with respect to nursing homes, many of which are unable under current requirements to meet their obligation to provide such services. The intended effect of this action is to permit qualified facilities to satisfy their uncompensated services assurance. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Comments must be received on or before June 3, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Written comments may be sent to Mrs. Charlotte G.

Health care facilities covered by the program received construction assistance under two titles of the Public Health Service Act, title VI (the ``Hill-Burton Act,'' 42 U.S.C. 291,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> ) and title XVI (42 U.S.C. 300q,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> ). Under both titles, facilities receiving such construction assistance have been required, as a condition of receiving the construction assistance, to provide an assurance that ``there will be available in the facility or portion thereof to be constructed or modernized a reasonable volume of services to persons unable to pay therefor *&blank;*&blank;*.'' 42 U.S.C. 291c(e). See also 42 U.S.C. 300s&hyph;1(b)(1)(K)(ii). This assurance is known as the ``uncompensated services assurance.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Regulations governing compliance with the uncompensated services assurance were first issued in 1947, and have been revised several times. On May 18, 1979, comprehensive regulations governing compliance with the assurance were issued at 44 FR 29372. Among other things, the 1979 regulations: Established a minimum level of uncompensated services which facilities were required to provide; set an annual compliance level of uncompensated services to be provided and required facilities to make up any deficit in meeting the annual compliance level through provision of more uncompensated services in later years; required facilities to allocate their uncompensated services either under a plan meeting certain requirements or on a first-requested, first-served basis; required facilities to notify the public of the existence of their uncompensated services programs through public notice and provision of personal notice to individuals served by the facilities; and required facilities to keep records documenting compliance and to periodically report concerning compliance. The 1979 regulations also for the first time established national eligibility criteria, based on income: Individuals whose annual income was at or below the poverty level (known as ``Category A individuals'') were automatically eligible for uncompensated services; individuals whose annual income was at or below two times the poverty level (known as ``Category B individuals'') were also eligible for uncompensated services, unless the facility decided to limit its services to Category A individuals only. The 1979 regulations also provided that amounts to which an individual was entitled under a third-party insurance or governmental program could not be credited towards a facility's uncompensated services quota. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On December 3, 1987, the Secretary revised the 1979 regulations at 52 FR 46022. As pertinent here, the 1987 regulations effected a technical revision of the 1979 regulations, making explicit what had formerly been implicit in those regulations;  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> that coverage of an indigent under a third-party insurance or governmental program precludes eligibility for uncompensated services. 42 CFR 124.505(a)(1) (1988). This policy simply reflects the long-standing Department view of the uncompensated services program as a program of last resort, designed to serve persons who have no source of payment, such as Medicaid or private insurance, for medical care.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This policy has created major compliance problems for many Hill-Burton-obligated nursing homes. HHS has determined that, of the 287 nursing homes with outstanding uncompensated services obligations under the general compliance standards of the regulations, 243 have deficits; the majority of these have received no uncompensated services credit. These deficits persist despite many attempts by HHS to provide technical assistance to nursing homes to bring them into compliance. The fundamental problem is that, in most of these nursing homes, the only individuals who meet the income-eligibility requirements for receipt of uncompensated services are also covered by their State's Medicaid program; hence, they are by definition ineligible for uncompensated services under &sect;124.505(a)(1). Thus, in States in which the Medicaid eligibility limits exceed the Hill-Burton eligibility limits and which cover most or all medical services, nursing homes are in the unenviable position of being chronically unable to fulfill their uncompensated services obligations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

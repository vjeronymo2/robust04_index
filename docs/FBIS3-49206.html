We must not forget  that Croatia offered its hospitality to the UN Protection Forces  [UNPROFOR] command. For us it is important to meet with your  leaders, to have their understanding and their support and to  make sure that we share common aims and objectives."    [Correspondent] Yasuhi Akashi's statement at the end of the  third working day in his capacity as new UNPROFOR envoy was  assessed positively. The last meeting Akashi had today -- with  Hrvoje Sarinic -- opened up new prospects for cooperation  between Croatia and UNPROFOR.    [Sarinic] "Mr. Akashi is a very experienced politician and  UN  official. He knows what he is doing and saying and he knows what  he wants. He had a great deal of success in his previous  assignments, especially the last one in Cambodia, which was a  complete success. Apart from that, there were poor  communications with the United Nations and I think that the  UNPROFOR and its command were very dissatisfied with  coordination so far. Mr. Akashi, who is starting his job now,  will devote all his time at work and energy to this problem. I  also think, as far as this is concerned, that this is a definite  improvement on the existing situation."    [Correspondent] The activity of UNPROFOR, i.e. of Yasuhi  Akashi and also of the Croatian side, will advance a little at a  time, but what comes next, i.e. what is expected, is UNPROFOR's  help in reaching an agreement on the end of hostilities here.    [Akashi] "We specifically discussed the problem of the UN  protected areas in the southern part of this country, the  situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and the humanitarian [word  indistinct] and refugees. I am pleased to hear that our stands  on all these problems do not differ from Croatia's. To all this  let us add a new approach to cooperation between Croatia and the  UNPROFOR. All disagreements and complaints will from now on be  individually examined to avoid generalization concerning the  inefficiency of the UNPROFOR in Croatia."</p>

			<p><P> May 29, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A PERFORMANCE ARTIST WITH A NATURAL INSTINCT TO SHOCK  </P> <P> It's a long way from tiny town Michigan to New York's East Village, but Holly  Hughes has taken the trek as easily and as irreverently as she mixes travesty  and social comment in her plays.  </P> <P> After majoring in art in college and a furtive try at a career as a painter,  Hughes discovered play writing in the early '80s while hanging out at the WOW  Cafe, New York's premier bastion of feminist theater.  </P> <P> Rebelling against a conservative, upper-middle-class upbringing, doing the  shocking thing came almost naturally for Hughes. Bashing traditional and  feminist dogmas alike, her theater combines the outre with the poetic. So bold  are these riffs -- with titles you can't print in a family newspaper -- that  Hughes has even had trouble getting actresses to play the roles.  </P> <P> "They think it's pure pornography and that it'll ruin their careers," she says,  only half in jest.  </P> <P> The 34-year-old playwright will perform her "World Without End" Thursday and  Friday and June 8-9 as part of Highways' monthlong "Ecce Lesbo/Ecce Homo"  festival celebrating Gay Pride Month.  </P> <P> Like fellow monologuists Spalding Gray and David Cale (among others), Hughes'  solo is fictionalized autobiography. "I'm performing some version of Holly,  maybe an improved version," Hughes says. "You can always improve on reality  through art."  </P> <P> But, unlike Gray, Hughes specializes in ribald iconoclasm and what Village  Voice critic Cindy Carr has called "dyke noir" theater. Like the late Charles  Ludlam, Hughes uses humor as a leveling device and trashy gags as a crowbar to  open the door for activism.  </P> <P> "Ludlam had a wide range of emotion within the style of camp, rather than just  being decorative," she says. "There are campy elements in my work and a humor  that's John Waters-esque in its love-hate relationship with popular culture and  trash."  </P> <P> But Hughes also has a serious agenda. "I implicate both myself and the  audience," she says, "asking questions like what it means to be a good mother  in the context of a culture that is fundamentally misogynist."  </P> <P> That fear is central to the story she tells, which is inspired in part by her  own mother's "rather unconventional" telling of the facts of life.  </P> <P> "Women are punished because they're assumed to have a certain kind of power,"  Hughes says, still on the subject of repression. "But in fact, they're  relatively powerless."  </P> <P> That lack of power, Hughes says, comes from a paradox that has faced women  since before her mother's generation. Women are revered as mothers and yet  denied the chance to define themselves as anything but that.  </P> <P> "World Without End" was also influenced by Hughes' having overheard "two black  men sitting on a city bus talking about how white people were killing them."  </P> <P> "One guy was going on about how white people hate (blacks) so much they don't  even know they're doing it. I draw parallels between racism and sexism,  especially now that we're in this alleged post-feminist generation, it's again  become unchic for women to express their anger or to ask the world to change.  </P> <P> "I'm interested in ambiguity. Just asking a question like 'Is someone a good  mother?' becomes extraordinarily complex. That level of complexity in the way I  present the stories and the people in them makes people uncomfortable. I don't  necessarily say this is a good thing or not."  </P> <P> But Hughes isn't content to tear down ways of thinking without offering  alternatives.  </P> <P> "I try to match the horrific images (presented in her monologue) with some that  are transcendent," she says. "One of the difficulties of life is trying to  assess a situation."  </P> <P> Ironically, though, critics haven't been as circumspect in their analysis as  Hughes herself. "Even though there are strong women performers and writers out  there, when someone wants to praise (you) they'll compare you to Sam Shepard  and not to Irene Fornes or Caryl Churchill," she says.  </P> <P> "It's legitimizing because of the culture to be compared to a man -- especially  a straight, white man. It's not just male critics, either. There's some filter  -- an unconscious sexism -- that all of us have.  </P> <P> "Even though her style of delivery is completely different, you'd think that  (monologuist) Karen Finley would be an obvious comparison because what we're  talking about is similar, but nobody's made that comparison," she says.  </P> <P> One thing Hughes and Finley certainly share is the ability to shake people up.  </P> <P> "Probably no one gets through ("World Without End") without thinking, 'I wish  she hadn't gone off into that area' -- whether their judgments are based on  aesthetics or content. There's something to offend just about everyone."  </P></p>

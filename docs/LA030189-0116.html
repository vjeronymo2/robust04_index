			<p><P> March 1, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RJR SMOKELESS CIGARETTE TEST IS SNUFFED OUT  </P> <P> The "smokeless" cigarette developed by R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. at an  estimated cost of more than $300 million has been at least temporarily dropped  after five months of testing in several cities, company officials said Tuesday.  Most smokers apparently did not like Premier's taste or smell.  </P> <P> "Very simply, it did not perform as we hoped it would in the test market," said  David Fishel, senior vice president of public relations at R. J. Reynolds, a  subsidiary of RJR Nabisco. That test market was limited mostly to the cities of  Phoenix, Tucson, Ariz., and St. Louis.  </P> <P> However, the Winston-Salem, N. C., company has left open the option of some day  reintroducing an improved version of the cigarette -- which heats tobacco but  does not actually burn it. "All we're doing is discontinuing the test market,"  Fishel said. "We may reintroduce it, or something like it, at another time."  </P> <P> The Premier cigarette was designed to reduce smoke released into the air and  appease the anti-smoking movement. But the product had the opposite effect,  with health groups objecting to what they saw as an effort to make smoking more  acceptable without addressing health concerns.  </P> <P> "Not only did the cigarette pose possible serious dangers to smokers, but to  nonsmokers as well," said John F. Banzhaf, executive director of the  Washington-based consumer group, Action on Smoking &amp; Health. "After all, it  did not have any smoke, which is the one warning that ordinary cigarettes give  to nonsmokers."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Concern About Ads  </P> <P> The American Medical Assn. expressed delight at RJR's move. "The American  public has the right to expect that the products they consume have been judged  safe for human consumption before being placed on shelves for sale," AMA  Executive Vice President James H. Sammons said in a statement. Last year, the  AMA asked the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to ban sales of the cigarette.  </P> <P> "If they hadn't pulled it off the market, there would have been a regulatory  brouhaha," said Dave Stewart, professor of marketing at USC. Stewart recently  consulted with Federal Trade Commission officials who were concerned that  advertisements that positioned Premier as a cigarette with a "cleaner smoke"  were misleading.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, RJR -- which makes the Winston, Salem and Camel brands -- said it  will continue to test-market two other unusual cigarettes that were introduced  to a few cities in recent weeks. One, which is rolled in special paper and  appears to emit less smoke than most other brands, is called Vantage Excel. The  other, Chelsea, is said to have somewhat of a vanilla taste.  </P> <P> For RJR Nabisco, which earlier this month was acquired by the New York  investment firm of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. for a record $25 billion,  the move to drop Premier is viewed by some analysts as a setback. Just five  months ago, RJR officials openly discussed spending more than $1 billion to  roll out the brand nationally.  </P> <P> "Most analysts were expecting this," said Sarah A. Sheckler, vice president at  the Chicago investment firm Duff &amp; Phelps Inc. "I'm a smoker. I tried it.  And like most other people, I didn't like the taste, either."  </P> <P> Certainly RJR is not the first major company to face a setback with a new  product line. In fact, marketing executives say that fewer than one in seven  new products are successful. Coca-Cola was forced to put Classic Coke back on  the shelves alongside its new formula after a consumer backlash. Even Procter  &amp; Gamble's relatively new orange juice line, Citrus Hill, has not met the  company's expectations.  </P> <P> Some industry analysts even credit RJR for jumping out far ahead of the  competition in its testing of new cigarette products. "It was a very bold  experiment but it didn't work," said Lawrence Adelman, senior vice president at  the New York investment firm Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. "Their failure could  dissuade others from making it."  </P> <P> "If RJR had been successful with Premier," said USC marketing professor  Stewart, "every manufacturer would have soon come out with a smokeless  cigarette. This means it's back to the drawing boards for all of them."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Plenty to Say  </P> <P> But a spokesman for RJR's chief rival, Philip Morris, denied that his company  was preparing to market a smokeless cigarette. What is more, he declined to  comment on the Premier brand. "Our policy is not to comment on RJR or anything  that the competition does," spokesman Steve Weiss said.  </P> <P> But Charles Crow had plenty to say about Premier.  </P> <P> Crow's company, Grand Candy &amp; Tobacco Co., is a big distributor of  cigarettes in St. Louis, where Premier has been test-marketed. He delivered the  cigarettes to retailers ranging from local tobacco shops to major grocery  chains.  </P> <P> "It was evident to anyone who handled it that it was a loser from the word go,"  Crow said. "I bet you that after that first week's delivery, I didn't have one  reorder on the product."  </P> <P> In fact, Crow says that he will soon be shipping back thousands of dollars  worth of Premier cigarettes to RJR. "I never saw a cigarette that had so much  consumer interest before it came out," he said. "But I tell you, I tried the  cigarette and it was terrible. It made me nauseous for the rest of the day."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Indictment Against Nuclear Warmaniacs"--KCNA headline] </F>   [Text] Pyongyang, April 8 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today  describes the white paper recently issued by the Central  Committee of the South Korean National Democratic Front  (Hanminjon) on the nuclear arms development of the South Korean  authorities as one more stern indictment against the nuclear  warmaniacs.    The news analyst says:    According to the white paper, the South Korean puppets have  long since promoted the development of nuclear weapons under the  nuclear umbrella of the United States.    The heavy water reactor in Wolsong and the multipurpose  research reactor in Taedok, South Korea, are, to all intents and  purposes, military facilities for nuclear arms development  disguised as "commercial" and "research" reactors.    The heavy water reactor in Wolsong is not for "generating  electricity." It was introduced for the production of plutonium.  The reactor's structure is so designed as to change spent  nuclear fuel any moment without stopping its operation.    The multipurpose research reactor in Taedok can be easily  remodeled into a reactor producing plutonium any moment.  Moreover, it is closely attached to a semi-reprocessing  facility.    It must not go unnoticed that nuclear arms development is  being promoted in secrecy at South Korea's atomic reactors and  research reactors which are claimed to be undergoing routine  inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency.    It is only too natural that Hanminjon raised a question why  the IAEA, while taking issue with the pilot reactor of the  North, had not published the results of its inspection of South  Korea's heavy water reactor and multi-purpose research reactor  used for military purposes, whose capacities are scores of times  and several times greater than the North's.    The South Korean people are now fighting against war and  nuclear weapons and resolutely rejecting the Kim Yong-sam  bellicose group's development of nuclear weapons. They will mete  out a punishment to the Kim Yong-sam group.</p>

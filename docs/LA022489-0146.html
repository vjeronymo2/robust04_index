			<p><P> February 24, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHERN SECTION BASKETBALL PLAYOFFS;  </P> <P> 4-AA GIRLS;  </P> <P> CANYON DEFENSE, ERKENBRACK STOP WESTLAKE, 47-38  </P> <P> Canyon High School has two of Orange County's busiest and productive athletes  this week in Keri Erkenbrack and Christa Ramirez. Both play on Southern Section  playoff teams in two sports.  </P> <P> They were key figures in Canyon's 47-38 4-AA girls' basketball quarterfinal  victory over Westlake Thursday night at Anaheim. Erkenbrack scored 13 points  and had 14 rebounds and Ramirez, the county's leader in assists, had nine  assists.  </P> <P> Erkenbrack and Ramirez also play soccer for the Comanches, who play a 3-A  quarterfinal match today at Moreno Valley. Erkenbrack is a goalie; Ramirez  scored the goal in Canyon's 1-0 victory over Canyon on Wednesday.  </P> <P> Against Westlake, the Comanches (21-4), survived a fourth-quarter comeback by  the Warriors with a 9-2 spurt over the game's final 3:24.  </P> <P> "Basically we just outpowered them inside down the stretch," Canyon Coach Bill  Fitzgibbons said. "That was the difference in the game."  </P> <P> The Warriors (18-9), who never led, closed to within two points at 38-36 after  a Melissa Gische basket with 3:48 remaining in the game.  </P> <P> "At the end of the third and the beginning of the fourth quarter they came at  us and took us by surprise," Erkenbrack said of Westlake's comeback bid.  </P> <P> But in the final minutes Canyon went inside to 6-foot-3 junior center Sheri  Rhyne. Rhyne finished with eight points and eight rebounds, including four of  the Comanches' nine fourth-quarter points.  </P> <P> "Our main objective was to get the ball inside and take advantage of our  height," Erkenbrack said.  </P> <P> "I was wondering when they (my teammates) were going to start doing that  (coming inside to me)," Rhyne said of her play late in the game. "I think I can  actually play better underneath."  </P> <P> In the second half, the Warriors shot just 18%, on seven of 39 field goal  attempts. And they were only slightly better for the game, at 25%.  </P> <P> Fitzgibbons credited the Comanches' defense for closing down the Warriors.  </P> <P> "We went to a 2-3 zone in the second half," he said. "They didn't handle the  pressure very well."  </P> <P> Canyon plays Camarillo on Saturday.  </P> <P> Camarillo 56, University 45 -- Guard Nicolle Victoria scored 25 points to pace  Camarillo (21-6) overvisiting University (20-7). Center Shelley Davis led  University with 15 points.  </P> <P> Mission Viejo 60, North Torrance 59 -- Forward Derrie Nauta hit a 17-foot  jumper with 5 seconds left in the game to give visiting Mission Viejo (23-4)  the victory. Nauta scored 19 points and teammate Kristen Okura added 15. Laura  Collins paced North Torrance with 19 points.  </P></p>

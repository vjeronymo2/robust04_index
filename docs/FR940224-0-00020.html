			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Board has adopted this amendment as proposed. Non-recourse transactions resemble a purchase of assets more than the lending of money, and the final rule conforms the treatment of these transactions to the treatment of other asset pruchases between a bank and its insiders. Moreover, these non-recourse transactions do not constitute ``extensions of credit'' to the transferor under the National Bank Act as interpreted by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. See 12 U.S.C. 84(b)(1); 12 CFR 32.2(a). These transactions will continue to be governed, however, by general standards of safety and soundness, prohibitions against fraud and abuse, and corporate fiduciary duties. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 8 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 8 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> In addition, sections 23A and 23B of the Act may be applicable to such transactions if the insider or the insider's related interest is an affiliate, as defined in section 23A, of the lending bank.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Commenters supported the proposal, and no adverse comments were received. One commenter asked the Board to clarify whether limited or partial recourse transactions would be treated as extensions of credit. The Board believes that it is more appropriate to address the numerous possible recourse arrangements on a case-by-case basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Credit Card Plan Indebtedness  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Regulation O exempts from the definition of ``extension of credit,'' and thus from Regulation O's lending limits, indebtedness of $5,000 or less arising through any general arrangement by which a bank: (1) Acquires charge or time credit accounts; or (2) makes payments to or on behalf of participants in a bank credit card plan or other open-end credit plan. 12 CFR 215.3(b)(5). To qualify for the exemption, the indebtedness must be on market terms and must not involve prior individual clearance or approval by the bank other than for the purpose of determining the borrower's eligibility and compliance with any applicable dollar limit.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Id. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Board proposed to increase from $5,000 to $15,000 the threshold above which standard credit card loans to insiders would be counted as extensions of credit. This proposed increase reflected widespread increases by credit card issuers in pre-approved lending limits and, to some extent, inflation since the initial adoption of the $5,000 limit in 1979. The Board did not propose raising the limit for extensions of credit through overdraft plans, leaving that limit at $5,000. Extensions of credit through overdrafts in amounts up to $15,000 have not become routine.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commenters supported the proposed increase. Many commenters, however, requested that the increase be expanded. Thirteen commenters suggested that the proposed $15,000 cap on the amount of excluded credit card debt either be eliminated, increased, indexed, or periodically reviewed. Two commenters requested that credit card debt be exempted from the cap on general purpose loans to executive officers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Eight commenters requested that the overdraft limit be raised by an identical amount. Commenters reasoned that one extension of credit is the same as another and thus that no substantive difference exists between credit card loans and overdraft extensions of credit. Moreover, some overdraft protection plans are now tied directly to credit card lines of credit. Commenters also noted that the rationale that the credit card limit was being raised to compensate for inflation applied equally to overdraft protection.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Board has decided to increase the credit card exemption from $5,000 to $15,000 and to maintain the overdraft limit at $5,000. Raising the limit could encourage insiders to view overdraft plans as a source of credit, rather than solely as protection against infrequent and unplanned events. The Board is not prohibiting payment of overdrafts over $5,000 pursuant to a permissible pre-approved overdraft plan, but merely providing that overdrafts over $5,000 are counted toward the individual and aggregate lending limits of Regulation O.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Board believes that the proposed limit is an appropriate compromise between its concern to prevent insider lending abuse and the added convenience that even higher or indexed limits may provide. Commenters presented no evidence to support their argument that a cap on exempt credit card lending is no longer necessary. Finally, the Board believes that exempting credit card loans from the cap on general purpose loans to executive officers would be more properly addressed in the context of a more general review of executive officer lending restrictions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> V. Consumer Installment Paper  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to the authority granted it by the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 (HCDA), <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 9 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  the Board proposed an exception to the aggregate lending limit for the discount of consumer installment paper from an insider with recourse, so long as the bank is relying primarily upon the creditworthiness of the maker of the paper and not on any endorsement or guarantee of the insider. Such transactions would continue to constitute extensions of credit subject to the aggregate lending limit if the maker of the consumer installment paper was an insider.

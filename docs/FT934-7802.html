			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Jarvis Porter helped by purchases ACQUISITIONS HELPED Jarvis Porter, the specialist label printer for the spirits, toiletries and pharmaceutical industries, report an 84 per cent increase in interim pre-tax profits. Pre-tax profits grew to Pounds 3.42m (Pounds 1.85m) in the six months to August 31. Earnings per share increased to 7.2p (5.1p); the interim dividend goes up to 1.65p (1.5p). The shares, which have risen steadily in the past year, yesterday gained a further 7p to close at a new high of 277p. The growth in profits was fuelled by higher turnover and a small increase in margins. Turnover increased by 71 per cent to Pounds 28m (Pounds 16.4m), including Pounds 3.67m from the acquisition of two self-adhesive label producers, Dolphin in Lewis and Irwin Packaging in Cardiff, in March. Overall, Mr Richard Brewster, chief executive, said recent acquisitions, including those made last year, accounted for about Pounds 10m of first-half turnover. Operating profit increased by 92 per cent to Pounds 3.54m (Pounds 1.84m), including Pounds 373,000 attributable to Dolphin and Irwin. Excluding acquisitions profits increased by about 10 per cent. While the core label production business achieved 'creditable results through additional business and improved efficiencies,' the group's promotional print businesses, John Quarmby in the UK and Waterlomat in Brussels, which both produce beer mats, also performed well. Despite paying Pounds 4.6m in cash for Dolphin and Irwin and assuming Pounds 1.5m in debt, the group ended the period with net debt of just Pounds 900,000, equivalent to gearing of 5 per cent, compared to net cash of Pounds 3.2m at the end of February. Mr Brewster said the group is considering further acquisitions, particularly in continental Europe.</p>

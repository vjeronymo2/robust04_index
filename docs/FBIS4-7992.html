			<p>BFN     [Text] Zagreb, April 7 (AFP) -- A series of explosions  ripped through a munitions dump outside the Croatian capital  Thursday [7 April], prompting the authorities to place the  surrounding suburbs under alert and stop all traffic.    The dump was ablaze and shells were exploding every few  seconds, eyewitnesses said. Residents near the munitions depot  in Sesvete, about 12 kilometres (seven miles) outside Zagreb,  were told to take refuge in bomb-shelters.    There were no immediate reports of casualties but Sesvete  police told AFP they expected that people had been injured.</p>

			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Pattern of business failures Sir, Your report 'Receiverships at lowest level for four years' (October 6) draws some misleading conclusions from the latest figures on receivership levels. In my experience with small businesses particularly, there is no conscious reluctance to expand as we emerge from recession, but rather a suspicion that the recovery might not be sustained. Once this suspicion is dispelled, there is the danger that the 'normal' situation will prevail and business failures increase. It is the responsibility of business advisers to ensure that their clients follow a sensible policy, something which was lacking in past economic recoveries. The 'rescue' facilities within the British insolvency system have been with us throughout the recession. It is only recently that preferential and many secured creditors have come to realise that they stand to lose less by supporting voluntary arrangements than forcing a company out of business. Greater publicity of late has created more awareness of this facility with both creditors and debtors. The length and severity of the recession has resulted in the closure this year of those companies which were either poorly managed, badly advised or most exposed to a reduction in business. A drop in failure levels at some stage is inevitable - there are not so many left] Gordon Harrow, 1 Falmouth Close, Camberley, Surrey GU15 1EA</p>

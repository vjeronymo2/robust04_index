			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Slovaks Balance the First Quarter"] </F>   [Text] Bratislava--Over the first three months of this  year, Slovakia reached a surplus of 2.2 billion Slovak korunas  [Sk] in trade with the Czech Republic, Stefan Condik, chairman  of the Statistical Office of the Slovak Republic (SUSR), said at  a news conference in Bratislava yesterday. Imports from the  Czech Republic amounted to Sk14.3 billion during this period  (30.2 percent of the total imports to Slovakia), and goods worth  Sk16.5 billion were exported to the Czech Republic (37.9 percent  of total Slovak exports). These data do not include reexports,  however. Using the statistical method according to the trading  country, Slovakia had a deficit of Sk3.6 billion in trade with  the Czech Republic.    Stefan Condik said that the trend of deceleration of the  growth of prices emerged in Slovakia in the first quarter of  1994. Inflation rose on the whole, according to the SUSR data  for the first quarter, by 2.6 percent in comparison with  December of last year, and it was to a certain degree affected  by the development in wages. Wages in industry rose by 16.3  percent from February to reach Sk6,291, and in construction by  15.7 percent, to Sk5,919. Salaries in retailing rose 10 percent,  to Sk4,714, and in transport 6.7 percent, to Sk6,119. The  average monthly wages for the entire national economy reached  the amount of Sk5,400 in the first quarter, which is 14 to 15  percent (Sk700) more than in the same period last year.    There were 370,500 unemployed in Slovakia in March, which is  approximately 14.7 percent of those able to work. In comparison  with February (14.8 percent rate of unemployment), the number of  unemployed declined by 5,500 people.    The effect of the introduction of the import surcharge  became  obvious in March, and the trade deficit rose by only Sk35  million. The overall balance of trade ended with a deficit of  Sk3.7 billion for the quarter. Goods worth Sk47.2 billion were  imported to Slovakia during the first three months of the year,  which is 1 percent more than in the same period of 1993.  Exports amounted to Sk43.5 billion, which is a 2.6-percent drop  in the year-to-year comparison.    The value of foreign capital in the Slovak economy reached  Sk11.5 billion at the end of March. That is a 6.7-percent  increase in comparison with the last quarter of 1993. Austria  is responsible for the main share of investments in the Slovak  economy (23.4 percent), followed by Germany (21 percent). The  Czech Republic (whose share rose to 13 percent) recently passed  the United States (12.1) percent). Foreign capital is invested  in 5,719 companies. Since the beginning of the year, 35 firms  with foreign capital participation closed down in Slovakia, and  another 80 firms are being liquidated.</p>

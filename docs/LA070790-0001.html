			<p><P> July 7, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> SIMI VALLEY SCHOOL CHIEF TO RESIGN;  </P> <P> EDUCATION: JOHN DUNCAN SAYS HE WILL TAKE OVER THE TOP SPOT AT A NORTHERN  CALIFORNIA DISTRICT IN THE FALL.  </P> <P> Supt. John Duncan of the financially troubled Simi Valley Unified School  District said Friday that he will resign this fall to take over as chief  administrator of a Northern California district.  </P> <P> Duncan, who has headed Ventura County's largest school district for 16 years,  said his resignation will become effective Sept. 16. He said he has accepted  the position of superintendent of the San Ramon Valley Unified School District  in Contra Costa County, near Oakland. The job will pay $98,900, a year, about  $2,000 more than what he makes in Simi Valley.  </P> <P> "I've been in Simi Valley for 16 years," Duncan said. "Simi Valley has been  awfully good to me. But I'm ready for a new challenge."  </P> <P> Duncan, 57, said the district's struggle to offset an estimated $8-million  budget shortfall next year did not enter into his decision to leave the  18,000-student district. The budget crunch has forced district officials to lay  off 32 temporary teachers, four librarians and four nurses at some of its 26  campuses. Dozens of administrators were also reassigned to lower-level  positions with reduced salaries.  </P> <P> "Over the last five months, it's been very difficult . . . but it's very much  like any other school district," said Duncan, who has been the subject of much  criticism from teachers and union officials because of the cost-cutting  measures. "They all have budget problems."  </P> <P> Duncan said one reason he decided to leave Simi Valley is that several of his  children live in the Bay Area. Another, he said, was the pay increase.  </P> <P> He said he informed members of the Board of Education about his decision during  a closed session Tuesday night.  </P> <P> "We'll miss him and his outstanding leadership," board President Helen Beebe  said. "He has left us a real heritage."  </P> <P> Beebe also dismissed any notions that the district's budget problems had  anything to do with Duncan's decision to leave.  </P> <P> School officials have attributed a large part of the district's financial  problems to a lack of state money, due to an expected $3.6-billion shortfall in  the state budget next year. Officials also blame a declining student enrollment  and an 8% salary increase for teachers this year for contributing to the  district's financial problems.  </P> <P> Some of the district's 800 teachers and their union representatives, however,  have accused Duncan and other district administrators of failing to adequately  plan ahead to avoid major cuts. They have said it is unfair to blame the  teachers' salary increase for the budget problems when Duncan and other  district administrators are among the highest paid school officials in Ventura  and Los Angeles counties.  </P> <P> Bill Davenport, president of the Simi Valley Educators Assn., and several other  top-level union officials are attending an out-of-state educators conference  this week and could not be reached for comment Friday.  </P> <P> Beebe said district officials will talk to several consulting groups to assist  them in their search for a new superintendent. She said if a new administrator  is not in place by September, an acting superintendent would be appointed to  serve in the interim.  </P> <P> Supt. William Streshly of the San Ramon Valley Unified School District said his  district is slightly smaller than the Simi Valley system, with 16,000 students  and 23 campuses, but that it is growing fast. Streshly said he is leaving the  district to take a teaching position at San Diego State.  </P> <P> San Ramon Unified has had its share of problems this year. Streshly said the  district's 800 teachers participated in three wildcat strikes over a two-week  period in April and May during union contract negotiations. He said the  teachers had been demanding a 7% salary increase for next year but finally had  to settle for a 3.5% raise.  </P></p>

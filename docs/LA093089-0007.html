			<p><P> September 30, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DISRESPECT FOR LAWYERS AND THE COURTS  </P> <P> We can obviously tell that Hay is not a lawyer. Look at the way he tries to  defend them. He doesn't even once mention anything about lawyers representing  criminals. I guess the only lawyers he knows handle small claims. He makes  lawyers sound like saints and that the world would fall apart if we didn't have  them. Come, come.  </P> <P> Who helps to free murderers? Lawyers. Who puts child molesters back on the  street? Lawyers. Who helps drug dealers get back to their crack houses before  they miss their next customer? Lawyers. So are lawyers getting a bad rap? I  don't think so.  </P> <P> Although I am currently incarcerated, I can express my opinion from first-hand  dealings with lawyers. Many a lawyer has gotten me off even though I was  guilty. Although my crimes have never been violent or heinous, just the fact  that my lawyers got me off when I was so obviously guilty makes one ponder. If  they can do it for a forger, they can do it for anyone.  </P> <P> RAYCE A. NEWMAN  </P> <P> Chino  </P></p>

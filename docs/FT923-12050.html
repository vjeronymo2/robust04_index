			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / Observer: Right place, right time? John Bond, chief executive of the Hongkong Bank's Marine Midland subsidiary, must be hoping that he is luckier than John Tugwell, chief executive of National Westminster Bancorporation. Both men are the same age - 51 - and were given the same task of sorting out their employers' wayward US banking affiliates. Both have only been doing the job for just over a year yet already seem to be getting spectacular results. NatWest Bancorp bounced back from a loss of Dollars 276m to a net profit of Dollars 66.1m in the first half, while Marine Midland is also back in the black. Bad debts are falling and the embarrassed parents are once again boasting of how well their US offspring are doing. But there the similarity ends. Despite the fact that NatWest Bancorp probably posed a bigger challenge than Marine Midland, Tugwell knows that however hard he tries he is unlikely ever to get a shot at the top job at NatWest. That post was filled when young Derek Wanless leapfrogged everybody. However, Hongkong Bank's 61-year-old boss Willy Purves has promised to appoint a new group chief executive soon. Marine Midland may be less important than Malaysia, but it's the sort of high-profile job that catches the eye of investors who don't know how to judge the depth of the Hongkong Bank's management.</p>

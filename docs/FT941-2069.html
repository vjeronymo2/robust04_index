			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / World Trade News: Japan 'trapped' by chip imports deal - Michiyo Nakamoto on the implications of latest semiconductor market figures The apparently favourable figures for foreign share of the Japanese semiconductor market released last week have been greeted with both relief and resentment in Tokyo. On the one hand, the 20.7 per cent market share for the last quarter of 1993 is welcomed as proof of the tremendous effort that Japanese semiconductor users have made to increase market access for foreign manufacturers since the US-Japan semiconductor arrangement in 1991. 'The industry has worked very hard (to that end) in the last quarter,' says an official at the Electronics Industry Association of Japan. At the same time, however, there is resentment at US pressure on Japan to ensure that 'gradual and steady improvement in foreign market share continue throughout the duration of the arrangement,' as Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative said with the announcement of the fourth-quarter figures. Mr Tadahiro Sekimoto, chairman of the EIA, said recently that from the industry's point of view it would have been better not to have had the semiconductor agreement at all. 'We are troubled by the (20 per cent) figure which was an expectation but which has been turned into a target. If the agreement is to be continued we want the figure taken out.' Mr Sekimoto's is a personal opinion, but it is shared by many of those affected by the US-Japan semiconductor arrangement. 'We all want to call it quits,' says one Japanese industry member. The resentment stems from what is seen as a no-win deal that has caught Japanese semiconductor users in a bind. If the aim of the arrangement to improve market access for foreign markers is not reached, Japan risks US threats of retaliation. At the same time, however, if that goal is achieved it risks supporting the perception that targets work in Japan. During the ill-fated framework negotiations, for example, under which the US had been asking for 'objective criteria' in measuring progress in opening markets, the semiconductor arrangement was cited by US officials as an example of how numerical targets could be successfully used to obtain results in Japan. No matter how loudly Japanese officials state that there has never been any commitment on market share in the semiconductor arrangement - which notes only Japanese government recognition that the US industry 'expects that the foreign market share will grow to more than 20 per cent . . . by the end of 1992', few in the US seem to heed their words. Behind US pressure on the semiconductor issue is a misguided perception of how things work in Japan, laments one industry official. The ministry of international trade and industry has influence, but not enough to raise the foreign market share with a few tough words, he says. Nevertheless, for the trade ministry as well, the bilateral arrangement has left little choice but to apply pressure on Japanese industry and achieve a target it does not officially recognise. At the end of 1992, the key year in which foreign market share was expected by the US to reach 20 per cent, ministry officials pleaded with companies to buy foreign semiconductors even if it meant they would have to throw them away later, according to one industry member. While the share of foreign semiconductors in Japan did reach 20 per cent at the time, US pressure has far from diminished. Earlier this year, when the figure fell below 20 per cent for three consecutive quarters, the US requested an emergency consultation and asked Japan to adopt an action programme to stem the decline. 'It is strange for the US to ask us to adopt an action plan to boost imports when in fact US suppliers have not always been able to meet Japanese demand due to a shortage of supplies,' complains Mr Koji Matsui, deputy director of the industrial electronics division at the trade ministry. Meanwhile, the US Semiconductor Industry Association has said it believes the foreign semiconductor share will reach between 25 and 30 per cent by 1996. The Japanese industry is worried the US might again take this figure as a target and press Japan to achieve it. The concern in Japan is that, with a mid-term review of the semiconductor arrangement due by the end of July this year, and against the background of frustration over the stalled framework negotiations, the US may seek to win greater commitments in semiconductor trade, including a government guarantee of market share. Some in the trade ministry believe that unless it can be made clear that the semiconductor arrangement has no market share commitment, the deal itself should be scrapped.</p>

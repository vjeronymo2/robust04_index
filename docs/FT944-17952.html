			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / Blair offers olive branch to Social Democrat defectors Mr Tony Blair offered an olive branch yesterday to Social Democrat defectors from Labour as it became clear at the party's conference in Blackpool that his drive to drop Clause 4 socialism had wide support among delegates. Amid increasing optimism among party modernisers that opposition to his constitutional reforms will be short-lived, Mr Blair promised to 'welcome back' members who defected to the breakaway Social Democratic party during during Labour's left-right battles in the 1980s. 'Of course I welcome back those people who left the Labour party in the early eighties for reasons that were understandable at that time. The Labour party went through a bad period then,' he said. The party's national executive committee last night rejected leftwing calls for a special constitutional conference to debate the proposed changes, which would water down Labour's historic commitment to public ownership. But opponents will have an early chance to embarrass Mr Blair today in a debate on a resolution tabled by Glasgow members offering solid support for Clause 4. The resolution, which was tabled before Mr Blair's dramatic announcement on Clause 4 on Tuesday, will be backed by some of the big unions, including the TGWU general union. The NEC will urge delegates to shelve the resolution, which some see as little more than a chance for delegates to let off steam. However, supporters said the result could be close. Admitting the potential dangers of the reform programme, Mr Blair told the NEC that his promise to rewrite Clause 4 was 'a bold gamble that paid off'. Mr Blair, who decided to include the pledge shortly before the speech, attempted to minimise unease by promising widespread consultation on the wording of constitutional changes. The consultation will be led by Mr John Prescott, deputy leader, who will insist that Labour cannot rule out public ownership in any form. However, the wording of the revised statement of objectives is likely to lay greater stress on the party's commitment to community involvement in high quality public services. 'It's not about dumping or ditching. It's about being clear and precise and offering a radical but sensible vision of the future,' Mr Blair said. Conference reports, Page 10</p>

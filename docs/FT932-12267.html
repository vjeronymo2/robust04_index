			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Alarm at level of drug bill for NHS THE COST of drugs to the national health service was 'escalating at an alarming rate,' Baroness Cumberlege, junior health minister, told the House of Lords last night, Ivor Owen writes. In defending the government's decision to consider adding new products to the so-called selected list of drugs not available for prescription on the NHS, she stressed that the pharmaceutical industry was being closely consulted. Lady Cumberlege rejected recent suggestions by Lord Jenkin of Roding (C), a former health secretary, that the selected list system had not produced worthwhile savings since its introduction. She said it had produced savings of Pounds 75m in its first year of operation but assured peers that the government was being 'more cautious' in reaching conclusions about the addition of further categories of drugs. Lady Cumberlege promised to study allegations by Lord Ashley of Stoke (Lab) that a few pharmaceutical companies were offering inducements which resulted in some family doctors prescribing unnecessary drugs for their patients. Some drug trials, Lord Ashley said, were 'little more than drug company promotions'.</p>

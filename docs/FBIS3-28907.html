"No one from his family or  circle of friends paid him a visit in spite of the suspension  being lifted," confirmed the director-general of social  rehabilitation Baharuddin Lopa on Wednesday.    Visitors wishing to visit him must first be screened by the  prison guards. Questions are asked on the purpose of the visit  and they must disclose their relations with Xanana. "The  exercise is aimed at stopping bonafide visitors who may just  want to see what Xanana looks like," said Lopa who is also  secretary-general of the National Commission on Human Rights.    When asked about the decision to allow former dissident and  chairman of the Indonesian Law Aid Foundation (YLBHI), Adnan  Buyung Nasution, to visit Xanana, Lopa said the case was still  under consideration. "Nasution's letter of request is with the  justice minister and he alone can grant the permission."  [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / People: Non-executives Lord Parkinson, 61, the former Conservative minister of transport, is taking over as chairman of Starmin, the quarry products group in which the Abdullah brothers, Raschid and Osman, have a substantial interest. Starmin, which has a market capitalisation of Pounds 16.8m and has just reported an after-tax loss of Pounds 8.5m for 1992 after heavy asset write downs, has been hard hit by the recession. However, its balance sheet is stronger than many of its smaller rivals and it is understood that Lord Parkinson is keen to take advantage of expansion opportunities. Lord Parkinson, a former non-executive director of Tarmac, joined Starmin just over a year ago as deputy chairman. He will take over from the current chairman Owen Rout, a former senior executive with Barclays Bank. Rout, 63, who has been chairman for three years, will remain on the board as non-executive deputy chairman.</p>

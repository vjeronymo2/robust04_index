			<p>931220 FT  20 DEC 93 / Saatchi to shake up US networks Saatchi and Saatchi, one of the world's largest advertising groups, is preparing to shake up its three agency networks in the US, its biggest market, by splitting off media buying into a separate operation. The plan, being discussed with Saatchi's main US clients, is being pushed forward by Mr Charles Scott, the recently appointed chief executive. His strategy is to turn round the heavily indebted group by winning new business, cutting costs and increasing operating margins. The firm approach of Mr Scott, an accountant by background, has led to some disquiet within the group and to rumours that the founding Saatchi brothers, Charles and Maurice, have been looking at ways to fund a buy-out of one of the networks, Saatchi and Saatchi Advertising Worldwide. The group has said the rumours are 'pure speculation' and the network is not for sale. Mr Scott's plans for a separate media-buying operation in the US would follow similar developments in Europe. Zenith Media, Saatchi's media planning and buying arm, is set for rapid expansion next year, financed by a proportion of the proceeds of a Pounds 73m rights issue in May. The aim is to differentiate the Saatchi networks from their competitors in the US by offering to clients Zenith's expertise in the purchase of television, radio and press advertising space. At the same time, clients would be able to benefit from the discounts that a centralised media-buying operation could negotiate. Removing the media-buying function from the Saatchi advertising agencies would also allow Mr Scott to cut down on duplication of work and to reduce staff further. A Pounds 10m extra provision for redundancies - which followed the loss of two large US accounts worth a total of Pounds 30m for 1994 - plus pessimism about client spending during the coming year, led to a profits warning two weeks ago. Analysts' forecasts of pre-tax profits this year of Pounds 24m-Pounds 29m have been cut by about Pounds 6m.</p>

			<p><P> September 22, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RICK DU BROW: SATURDAY-NIGHT SPECIAL;  </P> <P> BURNETT ANTHOLOGY SERIES ADDS FIREPOWER TO NO. 1 NETWORK'S LINEUP  </P> <P> NBC has spent a lot of time promoting its new sitcom "Fresh Prince of Bel Air."  But some real TV royalty, Carol Burnett, may well be more valuable in keeping  the No. 1 network on its ratings throne.  </P> <P> Burnett's half-hour comedy anthology, "Carol &amp; Company" -- which debuted  March 31 and was an instant hit -- has its new-season premiere tonight at 10.  And the way things are going, it could be part of a trio of back-to-back series  -- "The Golden Girls," "Empty Nest" and the Burnett show -- that holds the key  to NBC's success in coming years.  </P> <P> Burnett, eternally youthful and buoyant, entered the Beverly Wilshire Hotel for  a 90-minute interview the other day wearing a well-worn, blue denim jacket  embroidered with theatrical mementoes, a short blue denim skirt and a simple  orange shirt. She came alone -- no accompanying publicist. The essence of  simplicity -- as usual.  </P> <P> The truth is, she hates it when her show is described as an instant hit -- "It  disturbed me as much as saying something's a flop after three weeks" -- because  it tells her how TV has changed:  </P> <P> "I really do notice this immediate judgment -- 'It's great' or 'Let's bury it.'  If that was true, my old series (the 1967-79 'Carol Burnett Show') wouldn't  have survived. We weren't a hit until after our third year. But if they  believed in something, they gave you a chance. Now they're so quick to judge  everything, and I don't like that at all.  </P> <P> "Nobody wants to fly by the seat of their pants anymore. They're more careful.  They were so careful about this anthology idea. They almost had to be forced  into it. I think because it was Matt Williams (who previously created  'Roseanne') and because it was me and because it was Michael Eisner (chairman  of Disney, the studio that makes the show), this issue was forced."  </P> <P> Indeed. "Carol &amp; Company," which has averaged 28% of the TV audience,  arrived with the odds stacked against it -- except for a good lead-in from  "Empty Nest." Burnett liked the anthology idea, and so did Eisner. But the form  was dead in network TV -- with ratings failures in recent years including  Steven Spielberg's "Amazing Stories" and revivals of "The Twilight Zone" and  "Alfred Hitchcock Presents."  </P> <P> At times, Burnett sounds like a voice in the wilderness. She knows networks are  terrified that straight musical shows will die, but she blithely keeps going  her own way: "My idea of heaven would be to get Angela Lansbury and Tracey  Ullman and me just to do a special together -- just sing and kick up our heels.  Tracey is probably the most versatile performer we have today. She's the best."  </P> <P> Burnett's not bad, either. And her importance to NBC is suddenly magnified as  the network's Thursday lineup faces the possible end of "Cheers" and the aging  of "The Cosby Show."  </P> <P> What's more, "Fresh Prince of Bel Air," starring rapper Will Smith, isn't yet  anywhere near the ratings hit that NBC thought it would be; in fact, it's  struggling. That all gives a lot of importance to "The Golden Girls," "Empty  Nest" and "Carol &amp; Company."  </P> <P> "But it's hard," Burnett says of her anthology series. "It's like doing a  22-minute pilot a week. It's from scratch every week."  </P> <P> And that unpredictability -- and unevenness at times -- is what keeps it  intriguing. It's a real TV risk. Tonight, for example, Burnett plays what NBC  calls a "sex-crazed senior citizen."  </P> <P> "She's not," Burnett says with a laugh. "Well, she's a little horny. But so was  my grandmother. In fact, when my grandmother -- who raised me -- died at 81,  she had a 40-year-old boyfriend who was a jazz musician over in Redondo Beach.  </P> <P> "But you know where this idea came from? We sit around the table and we  spitball ideas. And Marcia (co-producer Marcia Brandwynne) started talking  about the infantilization of senior citizens in some retirement homes, where  people keep apart seniors who might have a crush on each other. And then there  are their middle-aged children, who treat their parents as if they're infants.  So I'm an 82-year-old woman who flirts and has boyfriends in this home. It's a  valid premise."  </P> <P> And it's part of an encouraging transformation on Saturday nights. Suddenly,  the 10-to-11 p.m. Saturday time period -- normally the lowest-watched network  hour -- has an intriguing lineup. ABC will offer "Twin Peaks" in that slot this  season. CBS has Dan Rather's "48 Hours" newsmagazine starting tonight. And NBC  has Burnett followed by "American Dreamer," a new Robert Urich sitcom with  possibilities.  </P> <P> Burnett's not happy being against "Twin Peaks." She'd rather appear on it:  "Yeah. And it's opposite us. I mean, that's awful. I love that show. I hope  they move it. If we're canceled, I'm going to be at (producer) David Lynch's  door so fast."  </P> <P> But now that Burnett's back in weekly harness, she has her own production  company gearing up as well -- including motion picture plans for her published  memoirs "One More Time" and her old Broadway hit and TV special "Once Upon a  Mattress," based on the fairy tale "The Princess and the Pea."  </P> <P> "The second draft of 'One More Time' is being written now," Burnett says.  "We're in an agreement with Barry Levinson (director of 'Rain Man'). It would  really be about the relationship between the three generations -- the little  girl, me, from say about 11 to 19, and my mother and grandmother. It's about  these three females living together in Hollywood, a block north of Hollywood  Boulevard but a million miles away from the Hollywood dream.  </P> <P> "My mother came out here from Texas wanting to be a writer -- she wanted to  interview celebrities, and she worked at Fox for a while. She and my dad were  divorced. And we lived in a one-room apartment at Yucca and Wilcox. And it's  about that."  </P> <P> There's a possibility that Burnett might play her grandmother -- "if I thought  I could. I don't know that I can. I don't know." Would she play any other part?  "No."  </P> <P> Burnett smiles as she remembers her grandmother: "Oh, she'd steal stuff from  Thrifty's. She'd steal napkins and salt-and-pepper shakers and flatware -- she  had this big purse like Mary Poppins. And then we'd go see the movies -- we'd  see eight movies a week on Hollywood Boulevard. And we'd go to the john, and  she'd steal all the toilet paper and put it in her purse. I mean, we were on  welfare. She was a hoot, that one. She knew how to survive."  </P> <P> Professionally and personally, Burnett is clearly a survivor too. In the past,  she says, she had "buffers."  </P> <P> "I had Garry Moore when I was on his TV show. And on the Burnett show, Joe (her  former husband Joe Hamilton) produced it and had to handle whatever else was  going on." She never had to deal, she says, with those gray business eminences  she calls "The Suits."  </P> <P> But now, she says, she's leaning on herself more: "For one thing, I'm not  married to the producer anymore. And for another, it's a whole different age  for women. I was the little woman and came in and did my stuff. Joe did  encourage me to come to meetings. But I didn't want to because there was no way  I could say to somebody, 'I don't really like this sketch.' I just couldn't do  it. I would hem and haw and be embarrassed and think that I was being tough.  </P> <P> "Now I'm able to say, 'I'm not comfortable in this.' And I'm not killing  anybody by saying it. And I'm not emasculating anybody. The best thing is to be  honest. So I've been learning to speak up."  </P></p>

			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / Granada in talks on soap opera deal Granada Television and Allied Domecq, the food and drinks group, are believed to be close to agreement on a record television sponsorship deal for Coronation Street, Granada's long-running soap opera. Although no agreement has yet been signed a three-year deal worth a total of about Pounds 30m is under negotiation. Yesterday Granada would only say that it had been talking to a number of groups about sponsorship of the 34-year-old series which can attract audiences of up to 20m. A deal with Allied Domecq, formally Allied Lyons, on such a scale would almost certainly mean that a range of the company's brands would be involved. They include Domecq sherry, Tetley tea, Tetley beer, Castlemaine lager, Dunkin Donuts and Baskin Robbins ice cream. The Granada negotiations on sponsorship come at the same time that the ITV company is trying to persuade the rest of ITV to pay more for Coronation Street. There has been opposition to such a move. The prospect of a lucrative sponsorship deal - which would almost certainly depend on Coronation Street remaining on ITV - could weaken Granada's hand in the negotiations with the ITV network. Sponsorship money is divided up among the ITV companies according to their share of advertising.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Members of the Bophuthatswana Defense Force [BDF]  took up positions for a few hours this afternoon at the Odi  Prison in Mabopane north of Pretoria after it was set alight  this morning. This comes after incidents of violence at the  Rooigrond Central Prison in Mmabatho yesterday. Bophuthatswana  prison authorities have refused to give information to the media  stating only that an internal investigation was underway.  Prisoners are allegedly demanding to be released saying that  the government that sentenced them has been deposed. A  spokesman for the BDF said more trouble was expected and that  more troops will be deployed.</p>

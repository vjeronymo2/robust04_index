			<p>930524 FT  24 MAY 93 / UK Gilts: Inflation clues remain thin on the ground BRITAIN'S lowest retail price inflation figures for 29 years failed to excite the gilt market on Friday, when investors sold securities amid uncertainty over gilts price levels ahead of this week's big auction. Such a decidedly sniffy approach to a set of figures, hailed by the Treasury as 'astonishing', was partly because they failed to cause any real surprises. Also, they provided no firm clues as to the direction of underlying inflation. Over the week, yields for long-dated gilts dropped slightly to just under 8.5 per cent for bonds around a 25-year maturity. At the short end, yields were little changed on speculation that the government was unlikely to hurry over any further cut in base rates, held at 6 per cent since January. The retail prices index (RPI) last month rose by 1.3 per cent compared with April last year, after a year-on-year rise of 1.9 per cent in March. The figure was last bettered in February 1964. Excluding mortgage interest payments, the RPI rose 2.9 per cent between April 1992 and last month, after increasing 3.5 per cent in the 12 months to March. This increases the likelihood that this measure will stay below the 4 per cent upper limit set by the Treasury. However, fractionally worse news on inflation comes from a study of the various underlying measures produced by government and City statisticians. The RPI - less both mortgage payments and local-tax payments - showed a small rise between March and April from 3.2 per cent to 3.3 per cent. The year-on-year rise in this measure stood at 3.3 per cent in December last year and reached a low of 2.9 per cent in January. A series calculated by Greenwell Montagu - which as well as excluding mortgage payments removes movements in utility prices, seasonal foods and other variables thought to distort the underlying pattern - puts inflation at 2.9 per cent last month, the same as in March. In January it was 2.5 per cent and in February 2.7 per cent. These figures all indicate that in recent months inflationary pressures have ticked up somewhat, an impression underlined in last week's Bank of England inflation report which predicted that the RPI less mortgage payments would rise to about 3.5 per cent in June from the 2.9 per cent figure in April. Even though virtually every measure of inflation shows a fall since August - when the Greenwell measure puts the figure at a high 3.9 per cent - some in the gilt market are worried that the pressures will build up, assuming Britain is on track for a recovery of some sorts later this year. This worry is shared by Mr Nigel Richardson, economist at the London office of Yamaichi, the Japanese securities house, who says: 'People should be on guard against any mood of complacency that may be creeping in over the inflation outlook.' Last week's labour markets data provided, however, a few encouraging signs about future inflation. Average earnings grew an underlying 4 per cent in the year to March, the slowest rate of increase for 25 years and 0.5 of a percentage point lower than in February. Even though the March figure was affected by advance payments of bonuses and salaries in March last year ahead of the general election, the numbers indicate the generally depressed state of wage pressures. With many employees settling for wage increases of around 3 per cent or less, there is a fair chance that these pressures will stay muted for some time. On the other hand, there is a clear danger of the 4 per cent limit being breached next year, as the Bank's inflation report points out. Such sentiments did little to help the enthusiasm of gilt investors during last week's relatively quiet trading, especially as they looked forward to Wednesday's Pounds 3bn auction of 7 3/4 per cent stock due 2006 which underlines the large amount of stock due to be sold by the Bank this financial year.</p>

			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / Arts: A popular heretic - New Music JOHN TAVENER'S We shall see Him as He is is new to London, although it opened the Chester Festival earlier this year, before Thursday's Prom performance. It is one of his many devotional works since converting to Eastern Orthodoxy 15 years ago. This is our contemporary Tavener, not the English Renaissance 'heretic' John Taverner who later repented of his 'Popish ditties'] Yet in modern Western terms, the anti-Renaissance Tavener is scarcely less of a heretic. This time round, however, the heresy seems to be popular. The Albert Hall was nearly full. That would be partly explained by the prospect of hearing the redoubtable John Lill in Beethoven's 'Emperor' Concerto; but nearly everybody stuck out Tavener's hour-plus 'Ikon of the Beloved' too (half of the few who slipped away were lugging dazed children), and at the end there was a vociferously warm ovation. For a piece of such wilful simplicity, forgoing any development and any aural blandishments beyond shot-silk string-backgrounds and a rare, rousing fortissimo, that was impressive. It seemed to answer a felt need. 'Ikon of the Beloved' is Tavener's own subtitle, but more exactly We shall see Him as He is comprises 11 musical 'ikons', each a meditation - and meant as an occasion for meditating - upon a passage in St. John's Gospel (texts arranged by Mother Thekla, a Greek Orthodox abbess). With the Albert Hall organ, the BBC Welsh Orchestra under Richard Hickox supplied Tavener's plain instrumental requirements: just a large string band, three trumpets (for the fortissimi) and two timpanists (for pervasive sacred rumblings, from subliminal to violent). The excellent outsize chorus was made up of the BBC Welsh's own, the Chester Festival's and the professional Britten Singers. With calculated parsimony, all the music is derived from Byzantine chant, which has an effective exotic appeal that is not lost upon Tavener himself. The central tenor role (taken scrupulously by John Mark Ainsley) prescribes Eastern inflections. He bears only a surface-resemblance to the Evangelist of a Bach Passion, for he has nothing to narrate; instead he introduces the successive Ikons with long, rapt, melismatic 'I heard's' and 'I saw's', before each meditation expands into the semi-chorus or the whole choral throng. There is a great deal of serene repetition - notably of the initial cello-melody. In conventional analytic terms, this protracted music is barely interesting at all. Tavener's ground-plan allows for broad contrasts and a sense of an accumulating climax (in Ikon X), but no overt ingenuity in the composition. Still, one should not underestimate the achievement of producing a work on such a scale whilst being rigorously 'simple', and yet evading anything that could fairly be called banal. More important, the fact that it gripped its audience - or most of it - for so long and so successfully may suggest that it taps something more interesting than being 'interesting'.</p>
